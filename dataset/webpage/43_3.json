The Stanford Grape Boycott Committee, formed in 1968, was inspired by labor activist Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers of America\u2019s (UFW) efforts to organize unions to improve working conditions and protect the interests of farm workers and migrant laborers. At that time, the average wage for male grape pickers was $1.50 to $1.65 an hour, and $1.65 an hour for female pickers; these workers earned less than $1,500 annually and their living conditions were poor. Members and supporters of the Stanford Grape Boycott Committee successfully petitioned to remove grapes from the food service menu at Tresidder and held \u2018park-ins\u2019 at local grocery stores to get those stores to stop selling grapes.\n\nConcerns about the working conditions of grape pickers again arose in 1973, when a new group, the Farmworker Support Committee (CATA), continued to champion grape boycotts out of concern for the \u201cthousands of farmworkers struggling for unionization in California agriculture.\u201d The Farmworker Support Committee was active on campus through 1979.\n\nIn 1987, there was another grape boycott on the Stanford campus as concerns regarding the effects of harmful pesticides on farm workers arose nationally. The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n (MEChA) supported the grape boycott in order to improve working conditions for the laborers, many of whom were Latina/o/x; due to this, the boycott was generally seen as an issue of race. MEChA and the Office of Student Affairs led an informational campaign about pesticides and grapes to prepare students for a campus vote, which would allow each campus residence to decide to boycott grapes in their residential dining halls.\n\nIn 1991, Cesar Chavez, President of the United Farm Workers of America, gave a public talk at Stanford on the labor union and its historic grape boycott movement."}, {"url": "https://ufw.org/1965-1970-delano-grape-strike-boycott/", "page_content": "On September 8, 1965, Filipino American grape workers, members of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, walked out on strike against Delano-area table and wine grape growers protesting years of poor pay and conditions. The Filipinos asked Cesar Chavez, who led a mostly Latino farm workers union, the National Farm Workers Association, to join their strike.\n\nCesar and the leaders of the NFWA believed it would be years before their fledgling union was ready for a strike. But he also knew how growers historically pitted one race against another to break field walkouts. Cesar\u2019s union voted to join the Filipino workers\u2019 walkouts on Mexican Independence Day, September 16, 1965. From the beginning this would be a different kind of strike.\n\n\u2013Cesar insisted the Latino and Filipino strikers work together, sharing the same picketlines, strike kitchens and union hall.\n\n\u2013He asked strikers take a solemn vow to remain nonviolent.\n\n\u2013The strike drew unprecedented support from outside the Central Valley, from other unions, church activists, students, Latinos and other minorities, and civil rights groups.\n\n\u2013Cesar led a 300-mile march, or perigrinacion, from Delano to Sacramento. It placed the farm workers\u2019 plight squarely before the conscience of the American people.\n\n\u2013The strikers turned to boycotts, including table grapes, which eventually spread across North America.\n\nBut Cesar knew the strikers\u2019 greatest weapon was simply their decision not to quit, to persevere no matter what the odds or how long it would take. The strikers had to be prepared to risk everything\u2014beginning with their financial security.\n\nTwo and a half years into the strike, during the winter of 1967-68, some strikers, especially some young men, were impatient. There was no hope of victory any time soon. Thick Tule fog shrouded the valley, making things seem even drearier.\n\nSome young male strikers talked about violence, about striking back at the growers who abused them. By fighting back they could prove their machismo, their manliness. Cesar rejected that part of American culture that, he said, \u201ctells our young men that you\u2019re not a man if you don\u2019t fight back.\u201d He had already begun boycotting table grapes, following the tradition of his hero, Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Cesar also followed Gandhi and Dr. King\u2019s practice of militant nonviolence.\n\nSome of the strikers equated nonviolence with inaction or even cowardice. Cesar believed exactly the opposite. He believed nonviolence is more powerful than violence, that it supports you if your cause is just. He believed nonviolence forces you to be creative\u2013that it lets you maintain the offensive, which is crucial to winning any contest.\n\nBut for Cesar, nonviolence was more than a tactic or strategy that could be discarded if it wasn\u2019t working. He once wrote, \u201cHowever important the struggle is and however much misery, poverty and exploitation exist, we know that it cannot be more important than one human life.\u201d Cesar also quoted Gandhi, who said, \u201cDo something! Offer your life! If you really want to do something, be willing to die for it.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t teach people by lecturing or by telling them what to do. He led by example. He planted little seeds of hope that sprouted into a renewed movement.\n\nAgain following the example of Gandhi, Cesar announced in February 1968, he was fasting to rededicate the movement to nonviolence. He went without food for 25 days, only drinking water. It was an act of penitence for those who advocated violence and a way of taking responsibility as leader of his movement.\n\nThe fast divided the UFW staff. Some didn\u2019t understand why Cesar was doing it. Others worried about his health. But the farm workers understood. A Catholic mass was said daily near where Cesar was fasting in a tiny windowless room of an adobe-walled gas station at the Forty Acres, the UFW headquarters outside Delano. Hundreds, then thousands, came.\n\nIn 25 days, Cesar lost 35 pounds. His doctors said his life was in danger.\n\nBut the fast worked. All talk of violence stopped. Dr. King wrote Cesar, expressing admiration and solidarity. The fast ended during a mass in Delano with thousands. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was there, he said, \u201cout of respect for one of the heroic figures of our time.\u201d\n\nCesar was too weak to speak, so his statement was read for him. It ended with, \u201cIt is my deepest belief that only by giving our lives to we find life. The truest act of courage, the strongest act of manliness, is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others. God help us to be men.\u201d\n\nThe grape strike continued. So did the grape boycott.\n\nFor 100 years before Cesar Chavez, farm workers tried, and failed, to organize a union. Every strike was crushed. Every union was defeated.\n\nCesar knew the farm workers couldn\u2019t win with just a field strike. The growers controlled all the rural social and political institutions.\n\nCesar read about Gandhi\u2019s boycott of salt in 1930. He carefully followed Dr. King\u2019s Montgomery bus boycott in the mid-1950s.\n\nFor the first time in American history, Cesar and the United Farm Workers (the result of a merger in 1966 between the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee and the National Farm Workers Association) decided to use a boycott in a major labor dispute. The boycott changed the scene of the battle from the fields, where the odds were stacked against farm workers, to the cities, where farm workers could appeal for help to the American people, whom Cesar called \u201cour court of last resort.\u201d\n\nHundreds of grape strikers traveled across the U.S. and Canada, telling their stories and organizing mass support for the grape boycott. The strikers were joined by thousands of supporters who helped tirelessly organize the boycott.\n\nCesar and the farm workers believed if consumers in communities throughout North America knew about the suffering of field laborers\u2014and saw the grape strikers struggling nonviolently\u2014they would respond. For Cesar, nonviolence couldn\u2019t be understood in the abstract. It could only be seen in action. He said, \u201cthe whole essence of nonviolent action is getting a lot of people involved, vast numbers doing little things.\u201d\n\nHe knew most people couldn\u2019t drop what they were doing and dedicate themselves completely to the movement like the grape strikers, most of whom lost their homes, cars and worldly possessions. But Cesar and the farm workers showed ordinary people that by making little sacrifices every day\u2014by not eating grapes\u2014they could directly help the poorest of the poor.\n\nThe boycott connected middle-class families in big cities with poor farm worker families in the California vineyards. Millions stopped eating grapes. At dinner tables across the country, parents gave children a simple, powerful lesson in social justice.\n\nBy 1970, the grape boycott was a complete success. Table grape growers at long last signed their first union contracts, granting workers better pay, benefits, and protections.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Cesar and the UFW continued using nonviolent strikes, boycotts, marches and fasts to help farm workers stand up for their rights and gather support from ordinary Americans to aid them in their efforts. Those efforts continue to this day through the work of the United Farm Workers of America and the Cesar Chavez Foundation."}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/dolores-huerta-biography-3530832", "page_content": "Dolores Huerta (born April 10, 1930) is a co-founder and was a key leader of the United Farm Workers and headed up its famous grape boycott effort.

Dolores's parents divorced when she was very young, and she was raised by her mother in Stockton, California, with the help of her grandfather, Herculano Chavez.\n\nHer mother worked two jobs when Dolores was young. During World War II, Alicia Fernandez Richards, who had remarried, ran a restaurant and then a hotel, where Dolores helped out as she grew older. Alicia divorced her second husband, who had not related well to Dolores, and married Juan Silva. Huerta has credited her maternal grandfather and her mother as the primary influences on her life.\n\nDolores also was inspired by her father, whom she saw infrequently until she was an adult, and by his struggles to make a living as a migrant laborer and coal miner. His union activity helped inspire her own activist work with a Lanitinx self-help association.\n\nShe married Ralph Head in college and divorced him after having two daughters with him. Later she married Ventura Huerta, with whom she had five children. But they disagreed over many issues including her community involvements, and first separated and then divorced. Her mother helped her support her continuing work as an activist after the divorce.\n\nEarly Activism\n\nHuerta became involved in a community group supporting farmworkers which merged with the AFL-CIO's Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee. Huerta also served as secretary-treasurer of the AWOC. It was during this time that she met Cesar Chavez, and after they'd worked together for some time, co-founded the National Farm Workers Association with him. The organization eventually became the United Farm Workers.\n\nUnited Farm Workers and Activism\n\nHuerta served a key role in the early years of farmworker organizing, though she has only recently been given full credit for this. Among other contributions was her work as the coordinator for East Coast efforts in the table grape boycott, 1968\u201369, which helped to win recognition for the farm workers' union. It was during this time that she also became connected with the growing feminist movement including connecting with Gloria Steinem, who helped influence her to integrate feminism into her human rights analysis.\n\nIn the 1970s Huerta continued her work directing the grape boycott, and expanding it to a lettuce boycott and a boycott of Gallo wine. In 1975, the national pressure brought results in California, with the passage of legislation recognizing the right of collective bargaining for farmworkers, the Agricultural Labor Relations Act.\n\nDuring this time, Huerta had a relationship with Richard Chavez, a brother of Cesar Chavez, and they had four children together. She also headed up the farm workers' union's political arm and helped lobby for legislative protections, including maintaining the ALRA. She helped found a radio station for the union, Radio Campesina, and spoke widely, including lecturing and testifying for protections for farmworkers.\n\nLater Life and Continuing Activism\n\nHuerta had a total of 11 children. Her work took her away from her children and family frequently, something she expressed regret for later. In 1988, while demonstrating peacefully against the policies of U.S. presidential candidate George Bush, Huerta was severely injured when police clubbed the demonstrators. She suffered broken ribs and her spleen had to be removed. She eventually won a large financial settlement from the police, and her efforts helped to bring about changes in police policy on handling demonstrations.\n\nAfter her recovery from the attack, Huerta returned to working for the UFW. She is credited with holding the union together after Chavez's death in 1993. Huerta continues to be recognized for her efforts to better the working conditions of workers and of humanity in general and has received numerous awards including the Eleanor Roosevelt Award for Human Rights in 1998, the Puffin/Nation Prize for Creative Citizenship in 2002, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012.\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/rudy.fernandez/1925676", "page_content": "Rudy Fernandez\n\ntriathlete\n\nDecember 5, 1947 Iloilo, Philippines\n\nFernandez had competed in running, swimming and cycling, and prides himself in always finishing the race despite the obvious handicap.

But a movie editor-friend of ours had told us years back that we were about as tall and had \u201csoft palms.\u201d\n\nOne time, we missed him by a few minutes when he went to the National Press Club to settle a spat with another movie star through the intercession of our friend, then NPC president Marcelo Lagmay and former FAMAS president Rudy Salandanan.\n\nThe misunderstanding between the movie actors was resolved, all right. Which reflected to peace-loving nature of Daboy \u2014 he went out of his way to settle a row.\n\nHe had a soft heart for the small people, too.\n\nConsider: In one of those times when I dropped by the Press Club, I was thanked by some of the NPC employees for supposed Christmas gifts to them.\n\nWhen I asked them about it, they pointed to the sacks of rice which they said came from Rudy Fernandez, thinking that it was us.\n\nActually, I used to contribute cash gifts for the NPC employees during Christmas but not in kind. I told them that the sacks of rice did not come from us.\n\nWhen the NPC staff rechecked the gift\u2019s accompanying letter, they noted that it was the movie actor and his lovely wife Lorna who sent the rice.\n\nAs a science/research and development (R&D)/environment journalist, we were usually invited to speak in seminar-workshop for campus writers and budding media practitioners.\n\nOne such occasion was an Environment Reporting Workshop organized by our good friend, journalist-lawyer Manny \u201cJun\u201d Satorre of Cebu City.

The 381-day bus boycott also brought the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., into the spotlight as one of the most important leaders of the American civil rights movement.\n\nThe event that triggered the boycott took place in Montgomery on December 1, 1955, after seamstress Rosa Parks refused to give her seat to a white passenger on a city bus. Local laws dictated that African American passengers sat at the back of the bus while whites sat in front. If the white section became full, African Americans had to give up their seats in the back. When Parks refused to move to give her seat to a white rider, she was taken to jail; she was later bailed out by a local civil rights leader.\n\nBritannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About the American Civil Rights Movement\n\nMany of Montgomery\u2019s African American residents were politically organized long before Parks was arrested. For example, the Women\u2019s Political Council (WPC) was founded in 1946, and it had been lobbying the city for improved conditions on the buses for a decade before the bus boycott began. In addition, Montgomery had an active branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), where Parks also worked as a secretary.\n\nAlthough Parks was not the first resident of Montgomery to refuse to give up her seat to a white passenger, local civil rights leaders decided to capitalize on her arrest as a chance to challenge local segregation laws. Shortly after Parks\u2019s arrest, Jo Ann Robinson, a leader of the WPC, and E.D. Nixon, president of the local NAACP, printed and distributed leaflets describing Parks\u2019s arrest and called for a one-day boycott of the city buses on December 5. They believed that the boycott could be effective because the Montgomery bus system was heavily dependent on African American riders, who made up about 75 percent of the ridership. Some 90 percent of the African American residents stayed off the buses that day.\n\nThe boycott was so successful that local civil rights leaders decided to extend it indefinitely. A group of local ministers formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) to support and sustain the boycott and the legal challenge to the segregation laws. Martin Luther King, the charismatic young pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, was elected president of the MIA. A powerful orator, he was new to the area and had few enemies, and, thus, local leaders believed he could rally the various factions of the African American community to the cause.\n\nThe MIA initially asked for first-come, first-served seating, with African Americans starting in the rear and white passengers beginning in the front of the bus. They also asked that African American bus drivers be hired for routes primarily made up of African American riders. The bus companies and Montgomery officials refused to meet those demands. Many white citizens retaliated against the African American community: King\u2019s home was bombed, and many boycotters were threatened or fired from their jobs. Several times the police arrested protesters and took them to jail, once charging 80 leaders of the boycott with violating a 1921 law that barred conspiracies to interfere with lawful business without just cause.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The MIA filed a federal suit against bus segregation, and on June 5, 1956, a federal district court declared segregated seating on buses to be unconstitutional. The Supreme Court upheld that ruling in mid-November. The federal decision went into effect on December 20, 1956.\n\nThe boycott garnered a great deal of publicity in the national press, and King became well known throughout the country. The success in Montgomery inspired other African American communities in the South to protest racial discrimination and galvanized the direct nonviolent resistance phase of the civil rights movement."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/news-relationship-between-pau-rudy", "page_content": "Rudy Fernandez is one of the most decorated basketball players in Spanish history.

The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ordered Montgomery to integrate its bus system, and one of the leaders of the boycott, a young pastor named Martin Luther King Jr. , emerged as a prominent leader of the American civil rights movement .\n\nRosa Parks' Bus\n\nIn 1955, African Americans were still required by a Montgomery, Alabama, city ordinance to sit in the back half of city buses and to yield their seats to white riders if the front half of the bus, reserved for whites, was full.\n\nBut on December 1, 1955, African American seamstress Rosa Parks was commuting home on Montgomery\u2019s Cleveland Avenue bus from her job at a local department store. She was seated in the front row of the \u201ccolored section.\u201d When the white seats filled, the driver, J. Fred Blake, asked Parks and three others to vacate their seats. The other Black riders complied, but Parks refused.\n\nShe was arrested and fined $10, plus $4 in court fees. This was not Parks\u2019 first encounter with Blake. In 1943, she had paid her fare at the front of a bus he was driving, then exited so she could re-enter through the back door, as required. Blake pulled away before she could re-board the bus.\n\nDid you know? Nine months before Rosa Parks' arrest for refusing to give up her bus seat, 15-year-old Claudette Colvin was arrested in Montgomery for the same act. The city's Black leaders prepared to protest, until it was discovered Colvin was pregnant and deemed an inappropriate symbol for their cause.\n\nAlthough Parks has sometimes been depicted as a woman with no history of civil rights activism at the time of her arrest, she and her husband Raymond were, in fact, active in the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Parks served as its secretary.\n\nUpon her arrest, Parks called E.D. Nixon, a prominent Black leader, who bailed her out of jail and determined she would be an upstanding and sympathetic plaintiff in a legal challenge of the segregation ordinance. African American leaders decided to attack the ordinance using other tactics as well.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Political Council (WPC), a group of Black women working for civil rights, began circulating flyers calling for a boycott of the bus system on December 5, the day Parks would be tried in municipal court. The boycott was organized by WPC President Jo Ann Robinson.\n\nMontgomery\u2019s African Americans Mobilize\n\nAs news of the boycott spread, African American leaders across Montgomery (Alabama\u2019s capital city) began lending their support. Black ministers announced the boycott in church on Sunday, December 4, and the Montgomery Advertiser, a general-interest newspaper, published a front-page article on the planned action.\n\nApproximately 40,000 Black bus riders\u2014the majority of the city\u2019s bus riders\u2014boycotted the system the next day, December 5. That afternoon, Black leaders met to form the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA). The group elected Martin Luther King Jr., the 26-year-old-pastor of Montgomery\u2019s Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, as its president, and decided to continue the boycott until the city met its demands.\n\nInitially, the demands did not include changing the segregation laws; rather, the group demanded courtesy, the hiring of Black drivers, and a first-come, first-seated policy, with whites entering and filling seats from the front and African Americans from the rear.\n\nUltimately, however, a group of five Montgomery women, represented by attorney Fred D. Gray and the NAACP, sued the city in U.S. District Court, seeking to have the busing segregation laws totally invalidated.\n\nAlthough African Americans represented at least 75 percent of Montgomery\u2019s bus ridership, the city resisted complying with the protester\u2019s demands. To ensure the boycott could be sustained, Black leaders organized carpools, and the city\u2019s African American taxi drivers charged only 10 cents\u2014the same price as bus fare\u2014for African American riders.\n\nMany Black residents chose simply to walk to work or other destinations. Black leaders organized regular mass meetings to keep African American residents mobilized around the boycott.\n\nIntegration at Last\n\nOn June 5, 1956, a Montgomery federal court ruled that any law requiring racially segregated seating on buses violated the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. That amendment, adopted in 1868 following the U.S. Civil War, guarantees all citizens\u2014regardless of race\u2014equal rights and equal protection under state and federal laws.\n\nThe city appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court\u2019s decision on December 20, 1956. Montgomery\u2019s buses were integrated on December 21, 1956, and the boycott ended. It had lasted 381 days.\n\nBus Boycott Meets With Violence\n\nIntegration, however, met with significant resistance and even violence. While the buses themselves were integrated, Montgomery maintained segregated bus stops. Snipers began firing into buses, and one shooter shattered both legs of a pregnant African American passenger.\n\nIn January 1957, four Black churches and the homes of prominent Black leaders were bombed; a bomb at King\u2019s house was defused. On January 30, 1957, the Montgomery police arrested seven bombers; all were members of the Ku Klux Klan, a white supremacist group. The arrests largely brought an end to the busing-related violence.\n\nBoycott Puts Martin Luther King Jr. in Spotlight\n\nThe Montgomery Bus Boycott was significant on several fronts. First, it is widely regarded as the earliest mass protest on behalf of civil rights in the United States, setting the stage for additional large-scale actions outside the court system to bring about fair treatment for African Americans.\n\nSecond, in his leadership of the MIA, Martin Luther King Jr. emerged as a prominent national leader of the civil rights movement while also solidifying his commitment to nonviolent resistance. King\u2019s approach remained a hallmark of the civil rights movement throughout the 1960s.\n\nShortly after the boycott\u2019s end, he helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), a highly influential civil rights organization that worked to end segregation throughout the South. The SCLC was instrumental in the civil rights campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, in the spring of 1963, and the March on Washington in August of that same year, during which King delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech.\n\nThe boycott also brought national and international attention to the civil rights struggles occurring in the United States, as more than 100 reporters visited Montgomery during the boycott to profile the effort and its leaders.\n\nRosa Parks, while shying from the spotlight throughout her life, remained an esteemed figure in the history of American civil rights activism. In 1999, the U.S. Congress awarded her its highest honor, the Congressional Gold Medal."}, {"url": "https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/dolores-huerta", "page_content": "Co-founder of the United Farm Workers Association, Dolores Clara Fernandez Huerta is one of the most influential labor activists of the 20th century and a leader of the Chicano civil rights movement.\n\nBorn on April 10, 1930 in Dawson, New Mexico, Huerta was the second of three children of Alicia and Juan Fernandez, a farm worker and miner who became a state legislator in 1938. Her parents divorced when Huerta was three years old, and her mother moved to Stockton, California with her children. Huerta\u2019s grandfather helped raise Huerta and her two brothers while her mother juggled jobs as a waitress and cannery worker until she could buy a small hotel and restaurant. Alicia\u2019s community activism and compassionate treatment of workers greatly influenced her daughter.\n\nDiscrimination also helped shape Huerta. A schoolteacher, prejudiced against Hispanics, accused Huerta of cheating because her papers were too well-written. In 1945 at the end of World War II, white men brutally beat her brother for wearing a Zoot-Suit, a popular Latino fashion.\n\nHuerta received an associate teaching degree from the University of the Pacific\u2019s Delta College. She married Ralph Head while a student and had two daughters, though the couple soon divorced. She subsequently married fellow activist Ventura Huerta with whom she had five children, though that marriage also did not last. Huerta briefly taught school in the 1950s, but seeing so many hungry farm children coming to school, she thought she could do more to help them by organizing farmers and farm workers.\n\nIn 1955 Huerta began her career as an activist when she co-founded the Stockton chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO), which led voter registration drives and fought for economic improvements for Hispanics. She also founded the Agricultural Workers Association. Through a CSO associate, Huerta met activist C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, with whom she shared an interest in organizing farm workers. In 1962, Huerta and Ch\u00e1vez founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), the predecessor of the United Farm Workers\u2019 Union (UFW), which formed three year later. Huerta served as UFW vice president until 1999.\n\nDespite ethnic and gender bias, Huerta helped organize the 1965 Delano strike of 5,000 grape workers and was the lead negotiator in the workers\u2019 contract that followed. Throughout her work with the UFW, Huerta organized workers, negotiated contracts, advocated for safer working conditions including the elimination of harmful pesticides. She also fought for unemployment and healthcare benefits for agricultural workers. Huerta was the driving force behind the nationwide table grape boycotts in the late 1960s that led to a successful union contract by 1970.\n\nIn 1973, Huerta led another consumer boycott of grapes that resulted in the ground-breaking California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, which allowed farm workers to form unions and bargain for better wages and conditions. Throughout the 1970s and \u201880s, Huerta worked as a lobbyist to improve workers\u2019 legislative representation. During the 1990s and 2000s, she worked to elect more Latinos and women to political office and has championed women\u2019s issues.\n\nThe recipient of many honors, Huerta received the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award in 1998 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. As of 2015, she was a board member of the Feminist Majority Foundation, the Secretary-Treasurer Emeritus of the United Farm Workers of America, and the President of the Dolores Huerta Foundation."}], "The grape boycott led to the unionization of thousands of farm workers in California.": [{"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-labor-and-working-class-history/article/moveable-feast-the-ufw-grape-boycott-and-farm-worker-justice/E1B2D20ADD663D62C3B1D7642E389B70", "page_content": "When most people think of the United Farm Workers, two things come to mind: Cesar Ch\u00e1vez and the grape boycott. Regarding the former, Ch\u00e1vez distinguished himself as perhaps the best-known Mexican American labor and civil rights leader in the country through his advocacy for farm worker rights in California during the 1960s and 1970s. In 1970, the union he led forced growers to the bargaining table for the first farm labor contracts in the history of the Golden State. This achievement would not have been possible without Ch\u00e1vez's embrace of the boycott, a strategy that, until proven important to the struggle, had been regarded by labor leaders as supplemental to the main strategies of strikes and marches. In fact, when we evaluate the contributions of the United Farm Workers to the history of labor in the United States, the grape boycott might well be its most enduring legacy, even more so than Ch\u00e1vez's leadership.\n\nThis is one of my primary arguments in my book, From the Jaws of Victory: The Triumph and Tragedy of Cesar Ch\u00e1vez and the Farm Worker Movement. In 1965, Jim Drake, a protestant minister who became an executive board member of the UFW, convinced Ch\u00e1vez that the boycott would be a useful activity for volunteers after the peak of the harvest. Gilbert Padilla, also a founding member of the UFW, conveyed the logic behind the action: \u201cYou don't organize people unless you have something for them to do; otherwise you lose them.\u201dFootnote 1 From these humble beginnings, the grape boycott grew into the most successful consumer boycott in United States history.Footnote 2\n\nThe boycott, however, was not as simple as it appears to have been. What follows is an explanation of how the strategy evolved over a short period of time and how it became the effective tool that it was for approximately a ten-year period from 1965 until 1975, when the union shifted tactics toward state-sponsored farm worker justice under the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act. Critical to this evolution was the union's ability to adapt the boycott to the tactics of the growers\u2014essentially moving it and changing it to meet the challenges volunteers confronted in the field, which is to say, the cities and docks where grapes were unloaded, distributed, and sold. In this respect, the union, for a time, disabused the growers of the notion that their profits could be a \u201cmoveable feast\u201d like the feasts on the Christian calendar, in which dates change from year to year in relationship to Easter but remain a grand procession nonetheless.\n\nA Strike is Not Enough Although many birthdates have been offered, the grape strike on September 8, 1965, in Delano, California, began the multiethnic insurgency that was the farm worker movement.Footnote 3 The strike generated a good deal of publicity and support from Walter Reuther, the leader of the United Auto Workers, who famously joined the two main organizers, Larry Itliong and Cesar Ch\u00e1vez, in a march through Delano. Yet, for all of its success, by the time the harvest had concluded, the union ran the risk of being \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d of the public. This had been a problem in earlier struggles in the fields. Although many noble efforts had been made over the previous sixty years, no organization or leader had figured out the right approach to earning collective bargaining rights for farm workers. By the end of the harvest that year, growers showed their usual stubbornness in resisting negotiations and a confidence that they could outlast the poorly funded union. The boycott made a difference. Early on, the union pursued a boycott in a manner familiar to labor organizations: appealing to allied unions to stop unloading and distributing the product in question. In 1965 and 1966, that product was not yet fresh table grapes, but rather processed grapes in the form of liquor and wine. Gilbert Padilla and Dolores Huerta, two of the most important leaders of the movement, established an effective boycott of Schenley Company's wine and liquor by appealing to people they knew in the labor unions in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Padilla recalled, \u201cI went to the Central Labor Council, the restaurant and hotel labor union, the auto workers union; you name the union, we went to them.\u201d By appealing to fellow union members, the United Farm Workers cultivated a beachhead for further growth. Padilla also brought in farm worker families from Delano in order to appeal to urban consumers who might contribute their time to the cause. The appeals worked, as a stream of students and urban liberals sympathetic to the farm workers began to leave their classes and jobs to serve the union. In the case of Schenley, whose profits depended on the consumption of liquor in urban restaurants and hotels, the \u201cjobbers,\u201d or middlemen between the producers and the businesses that sold the product, became the key to the execution of the boycott. Padilla turned to a friend in the hotel and restaurant workers union, Herman \u201cBlackey\u201d Levitt, who served as the president of the joint council for labor unions in Los Angeles. Padilla recalled, \u201cThis guy Levitt said, \u2018Let me tell you how to do this.\u2019 And he got this book with all the jobbers. So we sent letters to all these jobbers we were going to boycott.\u201d Padilla's appeal to the wholesalers, or \u201cjobbers,\u201d worked. By April 1966, Schenley experienced steep sales declines in Los Angeles and San Francisco, two key urban markets, forcing the company to increase wages on farms from which they derived their grapes. This success made the boycott a permanent fixture in the UFW arsenal.Footnote 4 The attempt to boycott table grapes presented both new opportunities and new challenges. The perishability of grapes placed growers in a precarious position since profits could be lost more quickly than with liquor or wine that could keep, and even improve, with time. On the other hand, table grape growers proved to be a much more stubborn, cliquey group that resisted agreements with the union at all cost. Unlike Schenley, the local ethnic and family-oriented growers refused to see the boycott as a business matter to be dealt with through negotiations. Of the corporate growers, Marshall Ganz, a key UFW organizer and member of the executive board, observed, \u201cA lot of them had union contracts [in] other places; they weren't invested in their standing in the grower community; they weren't a part of that local scene; they didn't go to the Slav club and the Elk club and the same church.\u201dFootnote 5 Local table grape growers, on the other hand, saw the union's campaign as a personal affront to their integrity that had to be resisted at all costs. Buoyed by the UFW victory at Schenley, Ch\u00e1vez agreed to take the fight to table grape producers in 1968 rather than merely consolidate UFW gains in the wine industry.Footnote 6 Union leaders decided to start with a campaign against Giumarra Vineyards Corporation, the undisputed leader in table grape production.Footnote 7 This time, however, neither did the leading company concede defeat, nor did its peers show signs of weakening in the face of pressure from the boycott. Unlike the corporate growers who cared about labels, table grape growers rarely marketed their products by brand names that were conspicuous to customers in supermarkets, thus making the boycott difficult to enforce at the point of sale. Table grape growers frequently used multiple brands to market a variety of grapes at different moments in the season. When the union finally succeeded in distinguishing Giumarra's brands from other producers, fellow grape growers loaned Giumarra their labels to frustrate boycott organizers. As a consequence, rather than defeating the table grape growers during the 1968 season, the UFW found itself in a protracted war with the industry, no closer to winning the strikes on their farms or the boycott campaigns in the city. The union responded by declaring an industry-wide boycott of all table grapes, extending the ban to include Arizona grapes, but the growers did not budge from their position.Footnote 8 The growers remained intransigent, so to be successful, the UFW had to discover new cracks in the armor of their opponents. Indeed, the failure to bring ethnic and family-oriented growers to the negotiation table through either the strike or the boycott signaled the long battle ahead. The union leadership discovered, however, that the boycott had made growers more uncomfortable about their position than the strike. \u201cThe whole strategic premise,\u201d Ganz remembered, \u201cwas \u2026 that you didn't have enough power in the local labor market to win.\u201d The boycott shifted the battle away from the stronghold of the growers and into an arena that gave the union a better chance of winning. According to Ganz, \u201cBy shifting the turf [to the cities] \u2026 we could successfully fight them.\u201dFootnote 9"}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/delano-grape-strike-begins-ufw", "page_content": "September 8, 1965 marks the beginning of one of the most important strikes in American history. As over 2,000 Filipino-American farm workers refused to go to work picking grapes in the valley north of Bakersfield, California, they set into motion a chain of events that would extend over the next five years. We know it as the Delano Grape Strike.\n\nREAD MORE: When Millions of Americans Stopped Eating Grapes in Support of Farm Workers\n\nFilipino and Mexican immigrants had worked for decades along the West Coast, moving with the seasons to harvest the region's crops. The Filipino contingent in particular was growing restless, as many of the workers were aging and anxious for decent medical care and retirement funds. When one of their number, labor organizer Larry Itliong, declared a strike on September 8, he asked for the support of the National Farm Workers Association and its Mexican-American founders, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Although Chavez had reservations about his union's capacity to pull off the strike, he put the issue to the workers, who enthusiastically joined.\n\nThe strike lasted five years and went through a number of phases. From the outset, the already poor farm workers faced opposition from law enforcement and cruel attempts at sabotage by the growers\u2014some reported that farmers shut off the water supply to their meager dormitories. As frustration grew and workers increasingly spoke of violence three years into the strike, Chavez decided to go on a hunger strike, emulating his hero Mahatma Gandhi. In addition to ending the calls for violence, the hunger strike drew further attention to the movement, earning praise from figures like Martin Luther King, Jr., and Senator Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nThe union, by then known as the United Farm Workers, also called for a boycott of table grapes. Individual households stopped buying grapes, and union workers in California dockyards let non-union grapes rot in port rather than load them. Eventually, the industry could take no more, and the growers came to the table. In July of 1970, most of the major growers in the Delano area agreed to pay grape pickers $1.80 an hour (plus 20 cents for each box picked), contribute to the union health plan, and ensure that their workers were protected against pesticides used in the fields.\n\n\"We said from the beginning that we were not going to abandon the fight, that we would stay with the struggle if lit took a lifetime, and we meant it,\" Chavez said of the grueling strike. \"[Soon] all grapes will be sweet grapes again.\"\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Latino-Led Labor Strikes That Championed Rights for American Workers"}, {"url": "https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/workers-united-the-delano-grape-strike-and-boycott.htm", "page_content": "Demonstrators protest the arrest and prosecution of United Farm Worker (UFW) picketers outside of the Criminal Court, New York City. Image by Larry Gross. Walter P. Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs, Wayne State University.\n\nThe Boycott Campaign\n\nThe NFWA had always been more than a union.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the founders had consciously shied away from that title and offered many services beyond a typical labor organization. Chavez had organized the NFWA around the premise that the farm workers\u2019 struggle was part of a much broader movement for civil rights. The ongoing Black Freedom Struggle provided both inspiration and allies to the farm workers. During the strike, organizers from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), along with student activists from the Bay Area, arrived in Delano to offer support, drawing parallels between the Jim Crow South and rural California in the fight for racial justice.\n\nNFWA leadership knew that picket lines and local protests would not be enough to achieve their objectives. Their members lacked even basic legal protections and could be fired and evicted from company housing with little recourse. In addition, the growers had access to replacement labor and enjoyed significant political influence in Sacramento and Washington, D.C. In order to win representation, the union would have to engage in creative and unorthodox tactics.\n\nOne strategy that proved especially effective was the boycott. Labor organizations, including most AFL-CIO unions, faced strict restrictions when it came to boycotting companies or products. A primary, or direct, boycott, which targeted the employer involved in a labor dispute, was generally allowable. Workers could legally strike or picket their employer, for example, though companies did try to limit even these actions. However, when it came to targeting other associated companies, like a bank providing financing, or a store selling an employers\u2019 goods, the workers could not use similar tactics. These types of actions are called secondary boycotts, and workers were forbidden engaging in this form of protest by the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, an amendment to the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). However, because farmworkers were explicitly excluded from federal labor laws, the Taft-Hartley restrictions did not apply to them.\n\nSo, in December 1965, the NFWA called for its first boycott. The target was Schenley Industries, the second largest grower in Delano. Schenley was a nationally known company, with millions in liquor sales each year. This made the company an attractive and highly visible target for the farm workers. Organizers and volunteers gathered in cities across the country to generate support, picketing businesses like grocery stores, bars, and liquor stores that sold Schenley products. Most importantly, they also appealed to other unions not to buy or sell Schenley products. With the support of unions like the hotel and restaurant workers unions, Schenley suffered a significant drop in sales by April of 1966. The bad publicity from the boycott also hurt the company\u2019s image. This pressure would eventually bring Schenley to the bargaining table to sign a labor agreement with the NFWA, the union\u2019s first.\n\nThe Schenley boycott was only the beginning. Over the next decade, the union would repeatedly make use of the boycott, refining its strategy and approach depending on the crop and the employer. The tactic proved remarkably effective in nationalizing the farmworker struggle and - to some extent - neutralizing the effects of the financial and political power imbalance that existed between growers and workers in the Central Valley.\n\nWhat began as a fight for higher wages in Delano had now become a referendum on the right of farmworkers to organize and enjoy basic labor protections. Specifically, the NFWA targeted the exclusion of farmworkers from the National Labor Relations Act, which had enabled growers to refuse to recognize farmworker unions for decades. But the recent passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had created a new framework for farmworker organizing. Economic justice was social justice, and the NFWA demanded federal intervention on the basis of farmworkers\u2019 rights as citizens. Chavez argued this point before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Migratory Labor in 1966, stating: \u201cThe whole system of occupational discrimination must be killed just like the discrimination against people of color is being challenged in Washington. This, and nothing more, is what farmworkers want.\u201d For Chavez and the NFWA, this meant granting farm workers the explicit right to form unions and collectively bargain with growers--the same rights enjoyed by workers in most other professions in the United States.\n\nThe farmworkers\u2019 movement was inseparable from the movement for civil rights. The boycott had the potential to exert real economic pressure on the growers, perhaps even enough to finally bring them to the negotiating table. But the strike was more than an economic issue to the farm workers of Delano: it was about their basic rights as American workers. To focus national attention on this aspect of the movement, the AWOC and NFWA turned to another civil rights strategy: the march.\n\nBibliography\n\nAraiza, Lauren.

The Stanford Grape Boycott Committee, formed in 1968, was inspired by labor activist Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers of America\u2019s (UFW) efforts to organize unions to improve working conditions and protect the interests of farm workers and migrant laborers. At that time, the average wage for male grape pickers was $1.50 to $1.65 an hour, and $1.65 an hour for female pickers; these workers earned less than $1,500 annually and their living conditions were poor. Members and supporters of the Stanford Grape Boycott Committee successfully petitioned to remove grapes from the food service menu at Tresidder and held \u2018park-ins\u2019 at local grocery stores to get those stores to stop selling grapes.\n\nConcerns about the working conditions of grape pickers again arose in 1973, when a new group, the Farmworker Support Committee (CATA), continued to champion grape boycotts out of concern for the \u201cthousands of farmworkers struggling for unionization in California agriculture.\u201d The Farmworker Support Committee was active on campus through 1979.\n\nIn 1987, there was another grape boycott on the Stanford campus as concerns regarding the effects of harmful pesticides on farm workers arose nationally. The Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl\u00e1n (MEChA) supported the grape boycott in order to improve working conditions for the laborers, many of whom were Latina/o/x; due to this, the boycott was generally seen as an issue of race. MEChA and the Office of Student Affairs led an informational campaign about pesticides and grapes to prepare students for a campus vote, which would allow each campus residence to decide to boycott grapes in their residential dining halls.\n\nIn 1991, Cesar Chavez, President of the United Farm Workers of America, gave a public talk at Stanford on the labor union and its historic grape boycott movement."}, {"url": "https://ufw.org/1965-1970-delano-grape-strike-boycott/", "page_content": "On September 8, 1965, Filipino American grape workers, members of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, walked out on strike against Delano-area table and wine grape growers protesting years of poor pay and conditions. The Filipinos asked Cesar Chavez, who led a mostly Latino farm workers union, the National Farm Workers Association, to join their strike.\n\nCesar and the leaders of the NFWA believed it would be years before their fledgling union was ready for a strike. But he also knew how growers historically pitted one race against another to break field walkouts. Cesar\u2019s union voted to join the Filipino workers\u2019 walkouts on Mexican Independence Day, September 16, 1965. From the beginning this would be a different kind of strike.\n\n\u2013Cesar insisted the Latino and Filipino strikers work together, sharing the same picketlines, strike kitchens and union hall.\n\n\u2013He asked strikers take a solemn vow to remain nonviolent.\n\n\u2013The strike drew unprecedented support from outside the Central Valley, from other unions, church activists, students, Latinos and other minorities, and civil rights groups.\n\n\u2013Cesar led a 300-mile march, or perigrinacion, from Delano to Sacramento. It placed the farm workers\u2019 plight squarely before the conscience of the American people.\n\n\u2013The strikers turned to boycotts, including table grapes, which eventually spread across North America.\n\nBut Cesar knew the strikers\u2019 greatest weapon was simply their decision not to quit, to persevere no matter what the odds or how long it would take. The strikers had to be prepared to risk everything\u2014beginning with their financial security.\n\nTwo and a half years into the strike, during the winter of 1967-68, some strikers, especially some young men, were impatient. There was no hope of victory any time soon. Thick Tule fog shrouded the valley, making things seem even drearier.\n\nSome young male strikers talked about violence, about striking back at the growers who abused them. By fighting back they could prove their machismo, their manliness. Cesar rejected that part of American culture that, he said, \u201ctells our young men that you\u2019re not a man if you don\u2019t fight back.\u201d He had already begun boycotting table grapes, following the tradition of his hero, Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Cesar also followed Gandhi and Dr. King\u2019s practice of militant nonviolence.\n\nSome of the strikers equated nonviolence with inaction or even cowardice. Cesar believed exactly the opposite. He believed nonviolence is more powerful than violence, that it supports you if your cause is just. He believed nonviolence forces you to be creative\u2013that it lets you maintain the offensive, which is crucial to winning any contest.\n\nBut for Cesar, nonviolence was more than a tactic or strategy that could be discarded if it wasn\u2019t working. He once wrote, \u201cHowever important the struggle is and however much misery, poverty and exploitation exist, we know that it cannot be more important than one human life.\u201d Cesar also quoted Gandhi, who said, \u201cDo something! Offer your life! If you really want to do something, be willing to die for it.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t teach people by lecturing or by telling them what to do. He led by example. He planted little seeds of hope that sprouted into a renewed movement.\n\nAgain following the example of Gandhi, Cesar announced in February 1968, he was fasting to rededicate the movement to nonviolence. He went without food for 25 days, only drinking water. It was an act of penitence for those who advocated violence and a way of taking responsibility as leader of his movement.\n\nThe fast divided the UFW staff. Some didn\u2019t understand why Cesar was doing it. Others worried about his health. But the farm workers understood. A Catholic mass was said daily near where Cesar was fasting in a tiny windowless room of an adobe-walled gas station at the Forty Acres, the UFW headquarters outside Delano. Hundreds, then thousands, came.\n\nIn 25 days, Cesar lost 35 pounds. His doctors said his life was in danger.\n\nBut the fast worked. All talk of violence stopped. Dr. King wrote Cesar, expressing admiration and solidarity. The fast ended during a mass in Delano with thousands. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was there, he said, \u201cout of respect for one of the heroic figures of our time.\u201d\n\nCesar was too weak to speak, so his statement was read for him. It ended with, \u201cIt is my deepest belief that only by giving our lives to we find life. The truest act of courage, the strongest act of manliness, is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others. God help us to be men.\u201d\n\nThe grape strike continued. So did the grape boycott.\n\nFor 100 years before Cesar Chavez, farm workers tried, and failed, to organize a union. Every strike was crushed. Every union was defeated.\n\nCesar knew the farm workers couldn\u2019t win with just a field strike. The growers controlled all the rural social and political institutions.\n\nCesar read about Gandhi\u2019s boycott of salt in 1930. He carefully followed Dr. King\u2019s Montgomery bus boycott in the mid-1950s.\n\nFor the first time in American history, Cesar and the United Farm Workers (the result of a merger in 1966 between the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee and the National Farm Workers Association) decided to use a boycott in a major labor dispute. The boycott changed the scene of the battle from the fields, where the odds were stacked against farm workers, to the cities, where farm workers could appeal for help to the American people, whom Cesar called \u201cour court of last resort.\u201d\n\nHundreds of grape strikers traveled across the U.S. and Canada, telling their stories and organizing mass support for the grape boycott. The strikers were joined by thousands of supporters who helped tirelessly organize the boycott.\n\nCesar and the farm workers believed if consumers in communities throughout North America knew about the suffering of field laborers\u2014and saw the grape strikers struggling nonviolently\u2014they would respond. For Cesar, nonviolence couldn\u2019t be understood in the abstract. It could only be seen in action. He said, \u201cthe whole essence of nonviolent action is getting a lot of people involved, vast numbers doing little things.\u201d\n\nHe knew most people couldn\u2019t drop what they were doing and dedicate themselves completely to the movement like the grape strikers, most of whom lost their homes, cars and worldly possessions. But Cesar and the farm workers showed ordinary people that by making little sacrifices every day\u2014by not eating grapes\u2014they could directly help the poorest of the poor.\n\nThe boycott connected middle-class families in big cities with poor farm worker families in the California vineyards. Millions stopped eating grapes. At dinner tables across the country, parents gave children a simple, powerful lesson in social justice.\n\nBy 1970, the grape boycott was a complete success. Table grape growers at long last signed their first union contracts, granting workers better pay, benefits, and protections.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Cesar and the UFW continued using nonviolent strikes, boycotts, marches and fasts to help farm workers stand up for their rights and gather support from ordinary Americans to aid them in their efforts. Those efforts continue to this day through the work of the United Farm Workers of America and the Cesar Chavez Foundation."}, {"url": "https://www.npr.org/2016/08/02/488428577/cesar-chavez-the-life-behind-a-legacy-of-farm-labor-rights", "page_content": "Cesar Chavez: The Life Behind A Legacy Of Farm Labor Rights\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\nHalf a century ago this summer, labor activist Cesar Chavez joined thousands of striking farmworkers in Texas as they converged on Austin, the state capital, to demand fair wages and humane working conditions.\n\nTheir march, which started from the punishing melon fields of South Texas, was his march, too. It was a deep and abiding understanding of the challenges of the farmworker's life that drove his commitment to labor rights. The life of Cesar Chavez mirrored that of the people he was trying to help. Their cause \u2014 La Causa \u2014 was his.\n\nBorn into a Mexican-American family of migrant farm laborers and a life of grinding poverty, Chavez dedicated his life's work to improving conditions for the legions of farmworkers who kept fresh food on the tables across America \u2014 while they often went hungry, living and laboring in abysmal conditions and being paid unlivable wages.\n\n\"Without a union, the people are always cheated, and they are so innocent,\" Chavez told The New Yorker's Peter Mathiessen in 1968.\n\nChavez modeled his methods on the nonviolent civil disobedience of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. \u2014 employing strikes, boycotts, marches and fasts \u2014 to draw attention to La Causa. And he drew inspiration from the social teachings of the Catholic Church and from the life of St. Francis. An Italian nobleman who lived in the 12th and 13th centuries, Francis of Assisi renounced his wealth after a period of captivity during war and illness. He became a champion of the poor, living his life in solidarity with them.\n\nEven in the face of threats and actual violence \u2014 be it from police or other unions, such as the Teamsters \u2014 Chavez never wavered from his commitment to passive resistance.\n\nAt the end of his first fast \u2014 which ended in 1968 after 25 days \u2014 Chavez was too weak to speak, but a speech was read on his behalf:\n\n\"When we are really honest with ourselves, we must admit that our lives are all that really belongs to us. So it is how we use our lives that determines what kind of men we are. It is my deepest belief that only by giving our lives do we find life. I am convinced that the truest act of courage, the strongest act of manliness, is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally non-violent struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others. God help us be men.\"\n\nChavez's work and that of the United Farm Workers \u2014 the union he helped found \u2014 succeeded where countless efforts in the previous century had failed: improving pay and working conditions for farm laborers in the 1960s and 1970s, and paving the way for landmark legislation in 1975 that codified and guaranteed agricultural workers' right to unionize, bargain collectively with their employers and vote in secret-ballot elections in California.\n\nBut after these momentous, hard-won victories, the UFW matured as a union, and its influence gradually declined, while the political climate in California turned against labor. Chavez took up a new cause, sounding the alarm over the dangers of pesticides \u2014 but never gained the kind of traction of earlier campaigns.\n\nHe died in 1993 in Arizona, not too far from where he was born. He was still doing union business, at 66. More than 40,000 people attended his funeral.\n\nIn 1994, President Bill Clinton awarded Chavez a posthumous Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award.\n\n\"He was for his own people a Moses figure,\" Clinton said. \"The farmworkers who labored in the fields and yearned for respect and self-sufficiency pinned their hopes on this remarkable man, who, with faith and discipline, with soft-spoken humility and amazing inner strength, led a very courageous life. And in so doing, brought dignity to the lives of so many others, and provided for us inspiration for the rest of our nation's history.\"\n\nSome key moments in his life:\n\n1927: Chavez is born on March 31 in Yuma, Ariz., one of five children. When bank foreclosure forces the family to leave its small farm, the Chavez family joins the some 300,000 men, women and children streaming into California, following the harvest, during the Great Depression.\n\nThe work is back-breaking, hard-to-come-by and pays pitifully. For example, two hours of picking peas \u2014 in the hot sun, stooped over \u2014 yields the entire family 20 cents. They live in overcrowded, primitive housing with no electricity or running water. Sometimes they cram into a tent, or sleep in the rough. Chavez experiences profound discrimination at school \u2014 from teachers as well as other students \u2014 and drops out after 8th grade to join his family full time in the fields.\n\n1939: Chavez is first exposed to unions in San Jose, Calif., where his family is working at the time.\n\n1946: Joins the U.S. Navy and serves for two years at the end of World War II in a segregated unit. Chavez returns to agricultural work when his service ends.\n\n1948: Meets and marries Helen Fabela in Delano, Calif. They have eight children. He begins learning about Gandhi \u2014 who used nonviolent civil disobedience in the fight for India's independence from British rule \u2014 and the teachings of St. Francis, who championed the poor.\n\n1952: Starts working for the Community Service Organization, a Latino civil rights group that organized communities around issues such as voter registration, immigration and police abuse. He rises to become the group's national director.\n\n1962: Chavez resigns from the CSO because it won't endorse his proposal to form a farmworkers union. He uses his life savings of $1,200 to form the National Farm Workers Association in Delano.\n\n1965: Chavez criss-crosses California's Imperial and San Joaquin valleys to recruit members. At the time, he is so poor that he sometimes asks for food from the workers he is trying to help.\n\nIn September, the NWFA, under the leadership of Chavez and Dolores Huerta, calls for a strike against grape growers, joining the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, a Filipino American labor group. At the time, field workers earned as little as 40 cents per hour.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AP AP\n\n1966: Chavez leads strikers on a 340-mile march from Delano to Sacramento to bring awareness to La Causa of farmworkers. The NWFA also merges with the AWOC to form the United Farm Workers.\n\nChavez also helps lead a strike and march by farmworkers in Starr County in South Texas. Ultimately, the strike fails, as Texas Rangers bring in replacement workers from Mexico.\n\n1967: In addition to the strike, Chavez calls for a nationwide boycott of non-union California table grapes. He sends UFW workers to cities across the country to raise awareness. Their efforts dovetail with the civil rights movement and a greater consciousness of racism and economic inequity. Millions of Americans supported the boycott, which eventually became international in scope and lasted until 1970.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Bettmann Archive/Getty Images Bettmann Archive/Getty Images\n\n1968: In February and March, Chavez fasts for 25 days to rededicate and recommit himself to the struggle for justice through nonviolence.

In the past, big agribusiness had been able to end strikes through violence or negotiating small, one-off pay increases. This time, the union is able to secure broader rights: to organize and bargain collectively, in addition to better wages.\n\nHe calls for a nationwide boycott of lettuce.\n\n1972: Chavez fasts for a second time, for 24 days, to protest an Arizona law that bans farmworkers from organizing, boycotting or striking.\n\n1973: After a second strike against grape growers turns violent, Chavez calls off the strike and begins a second boycott of grapes and lettuce.\n\n1975: California passes the state's landmark Agricultural Labor Relations Act, which establishes and protects the rights of all farmworkers to form unions and bargain for better wages and working conditions.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Scott Maguire/AP Scott Maguire/AP\n\n1982: With the strong support of agribusiness in the state, Republican George Deukmejian is elected governor of California.

Alongside labor strikes, these boycotts helped agricultural workers make advances in their rights and conditions of work. The UFW campaigns remain significant in the histories of US Latinos, labor, and global boycotts for their strategic use of civil rights and family-centered rhetoric to galvanize support from food shoppers, for remaining flexible enough to embrace a diverse range of allies, and for bringing the US agricultural industry to the negotiating table in a way that Americans had never seen before, and have not seen since.\n\nWhen one thinks of the use of the boycott during the civil rights movement in the United States, one might think first of the Baton Rouge or Montgomery bus boycotts led by African Americans in the 1950s to protest policies of racial segregation and discrimination on public transportation. Shifting the analytic lens from the US South to the US West, however, reveals a parallel struggle taking place for Mexican- and Filipino-origin farmworkers\u2019 rights and the use of the boycott in a different way. This chapter addresses how workers in the civil rights-era United States, particularly agricultural laborers, turned to the tactic of the consumer boycott to augment the effectiveness of their labor strikes in the fields. The United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC) was the first union in US history to successfully employ a national consumer boycott\u2014first against grapes and wine, and then against lettuce\u2014to achieve gains in farmworkers\u2019 labor rights and conditions. Led by Mexican-American community organizers Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, the UFWOC capitalized on a civil rights ethos in the 1960s (and a national media already primed to pay attention to boycotts) to employ multiple organizing tactics including pilgrimages, fasts, and grocery store demonstrations that galvanized supporters in rural and urban areas of the country.\n\nConsumer boycotts of food and drink had happened before in the United States\u2014abolitionists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries had engaged in the free produce movement and boycotted goods produced by slave labor such as sugar and rice, and Jewish communities had boycotted consumer goods imported from Nazi Germany. In its use of the boycott, the UFWOC combined racial and class discourses to send a message to the American public that the (mostly Mexican and Mexican American) farmworkers who fed and nourished the nation were not being adequately fed or nourished themselves because of the lack of a living wage in the agricultural industry. The union framed the varied produce that consumers saw in their supermarkets as reminders of choice and plentitude and argued that impoverished farmworkers lacked that same agency and abundance in their lives. In its first campaign to boycott grapes from 1966 to 1970, the UFWOC planted pickets outside of popular chain grocery stores in cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Washington DC. In addition, it sent organizers to conduct boycott campaigns in Canada, focusing on the cities of Toronto and Montreal, and reached out to allies who could publicize the boycott in Europe. Through this international boycott, the UFWOC\u2019s goal was to persuade shoppers to only buy grapes emblazoned with the union\u2019s black Aztec eagle symbol, and to turn their business away from stores that carried non-union grapes. This drop in sales would hopefully push grower-employers to come to the bargaining table and negotiate worker contracts. The subsequent lettuce boycott in 1970 had similar objectives, but in that case Cesar Chavez would threaten an entire web of boycotts against other products sold by corporations tied to the agricultural industry.\n\nThere are many reasons why the UFWOC food boycotts are still heralded as clever and successful in American history. First, the union tapped into the desire for empowerment, not just from its farmworker constituency but also from the consumers it targeted at grocery stores. Through just one simple purchasing decision, food shoppers could feel like they were helping the farmworker no matter how distant their identity felt from that of a poor farmworker or how far away they lived from the fields of California. This was a time period characterized not only by ethnic \u201cpower\u201d movements but the consumer rights movement that encouraged Americans to express their moral and political views through what they did and did not consume. Not buying grapes became a particularly attractive, and not arduous, way of expressing one\u2019s politics. The UFWOC reached out across racial lines to include consumers of all backgrounds in a moral economy, and in this way gained the support of people who otherwise might not have cared about the struggles of Latino and Asian farmworkers. Second, the UFWOC (particularly its female organizers) recognized how effective a gendered or family-centered discourse could be in reaching shoppers who tended to be women\u2014mothers, daughters, and housewives\u2014and who were in charge of making their household\u2019s food purchases. The union banked on the power of the purse and encouraged women (especially middle-class white women) to stand up with them against the mostly male leaders of agribusinesses and managers of grocery stores by threatening to take their dollars elsewhere. Finally, because the boycotts occurred in multiple locations under different organizers\u2019 styles, they retained a capaciousness and flexibility that enabled them to embrace supporters across many lines of difference including race, class, gender, and geography. These diverse allies, and the broader \u201crights\u201d agenda and climate of the time, helped the UFWOC gain visibility, strength, and support. In pairing boycotts with strikes, and in connecting food items to consumers\u2019 ethics and sympathy for downtrodden laborers, the UFWOC brought the agricultural industry to its knees in a way that Americans had never seen before, and have not seen since.\n\nBy the 1930s, California agriculture could genuinely be characterized as agribusiness\u2014more land and wealth had consolidated in the hands of fewer people, and employers were using increasingly industrialized and corporatized systems of farm production and taking advantage of successive waves of low-wage workers. Native Americans, Asians, and Asian Americans (Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Indian), Anglo American migrants from the Dust Bowl, and Mexicans and Mexican Americans all took their turns toiling in various segments of the state\u2019s agricultural industry. During the 1930s, coalitions of field, cannery, and packing house workers joined labor unions and staged strikes in crops such as cotton, lettuce, and cantaloupe, but the results of these moments of labor militancy were mixed. While some workers won higher wages and better conditions, others experienced physical violence such as tear-gassing and beatings in the streets, or fires set to their labor camps (oftentimes, this violence was the direct result of their employers\u2019 collusion with local and state law enforcement officials). What exacerbated agricultural workers\u2019 vulnerability was absolute neglect by US federal law. Protective New Deal legislation including the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Wagner Act), which permitted workers to join collective bargaining units, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established a 44-hour workweek, established a national minimum wage, guaranteed \u201ctime-and-a-half\u201d for overtime work, and prohibited child labor, was applied to industrial workers but excluded domestic workers and farmworkers. Exploited and economically desperate, farmworkers traveled the migrant labor circuit all over California and the entire country, and this peripatetic lifestyle further hindered any stable political mobilization.\n\nWorld War II ushered in another massive obstacle to agricultural workers\u2019 unionization. The Bracero Program, a guestworker program negotiated between the US and Mexican governments in the summer of 1942 to relieve the wartime labor shortage, imported thousands of Mexican men to work on US farms and railroads. With a cheaper, non-unionized reservoir of foreign labor at their disposal, agricultural employers lobbied for Congress\u2019 renewal of the program until 1964. Meanwhile, they depressed wages for US citizen farmworkers (who were mostly Mexican or Filipino American by this time) or, if these citizens protested, replaced them altogether with braceros who worked 10\u201314-hour days for an average of one dollar a day. The Bracero Program fundamentally altered the labor landscape of the United States and, along with taking away US farmworkers\u2019 bargaining power, kept them in migratory conditions that made them ineligible for health insurance, welfare, or voting rights. In the fields, all farmworkers, regardless of nationality, continued to suffer from inadequate water, rest, and shade, as well as overexposure to pesticides. Many women farmworkers experienced sexual harassment on the job, and migrant farmworker children remained the nation\u2019s \u201cmost educationally deprived\u201d population.Footnote 1 By the early 1960s, California agribusiness had become a 4-billion-dollar-a-year industry, but the wealth was not trickling down to laborers who still dreamed of a successful and centralized farmworkers\u2019 union. In 1964, Congress finally terminated the Bracero Program due to various protests against its lack of regulation and monitoring of guestworkers\u2019 laboring conditions and personal safety. This opened a precious window of opportunity for Cesar Chavez\u2019s and Dolores Huerta\u2019s burgeoning National Farm Workers Association (NFWA). When Filipino labor activist Larry Itliong asked the NFWA to join his Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) in a grape workers\u2019 strike in Delano, California, the three organizers identified two main targets\u2014Schenley Industries and the DiGiorgio Corporation\u2014that represented some of the most powerful California agribusiness interests.\n\nVery quickly, Chavez became the figurehead for the Delano grape strikers\u2019 movement. He presented as humble yet charismatic, and due to his own experiences as a migrant laborer, he was a relatable figure to Mexican-American and Filipino-American farmworkers. A devout Catholic who likened his philosophy of non-violence to contemporary civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi, Chavez captivated the US political mainstream and media by imbuing the farmworker cause with religious overtones and moments that involved food. He publicly fasted on numerous occasions, once for 25 consecutive days, to highlight the deprivation and suffering of poor farm laborers (one of the biggest media moments for the farmworker struggle took place when Robert Kennedy flew in to California to help Chavez break his fast by sharing a Communion tortilla). In March 1966, Chavez led thousands of farmworkers in a 300-mile pilgrimage from Delano to California\u2019s capitol of Sacramento. The march fascinated many watching along the route and on television\u2014onlookers handed out food to the marchers and sometimes even joined them\u2014and by the time the march ended on Easter Sunday on the steps of the California capitol building, it had grown to 10,000 people. News photos and videos of the limping and bleeding Chavez, along with the crowd roaring \u201cViva Cesar!\u201d and \u201cViva Huelga!\u201d (Long Live Cesar! And Long Live the Strike!) showed Americans that a farmworker movement was taking shape. After the media attention in Sacramento, Schenley Industries recognized the NFWA as a union. In August 1966, the NFWA merged with the AWOC to form the UFWOC, with Chavez serving as president and Huerta as vice president. Negotiations with DiGiorgio were prolonged and more difficult, and when the UFWOC sought to negotiate with a third entity, Giumarra Vineyards (California\u2019s largest table grape grower), it encountered even more resistance. Giumarra refused to recognize the union and hired a mostly foreign labor force to replace its striking workers. When the UFWOC called for a boycott against Giumarra\u2019s products, the company simply packaged and distributed its goods under other growers\u2019 labels.\n\nPushed to take more drastic action, the UFWOC called for a national boycott of all California table grapes in January 1968. The union now argued that the entire grape industry, not just a few growers, was corrupt and exploitative. In their appeals to consumers, the union declared non-union grapes were toxic\u2014not only because of pesticides but because they had been cultivated under unethical labor conditions and farmworkers\u2019 suffering. While it was true that the NLRA prohibited workers from engaging in secondary boycotts, farmworkers\u2019 notorious exclusion from this act meant that they had found a loophole, and the secondary boycott remained a viable organizing tool for them. The UFWOC sent organizers to conduct the grape boycott in almost 50 cities around the country and in Canada.Footnote 2 In all of these places, boycott organizers were responsible for contacting and mobilizing potential allies\u2014labor unions, political activists and community organizations, religious supporters, women\u2019s clubs, peace groups, student protesters, and concerned consumers\u2014who could stand behind the union as it boycotted grocery stores selling non-UFWOC grapes. The union knew it had to make its demand on consumers simple; all one had to do was commit to not buying grapes or shopping at stores that sold grapes. This task did not cause much disruption to people\u2019s routines, but allowed them to feel that they had contributed to the farmworker movement and expressed their opposition to labor abuses.\n\nWomen quickly distinguished themselves as leading figures among the boycott\u2019s organizers. Some women made the decision to lead the campaigns in unfamiliar cities alongside their spouses\u2014Mary Elena and Albert Rojas directed together in Pittsburgh, Alfredo and Juanita Herrera managed the boycott in Denver, Julio and Fina Hern\u00e1ndez coordinated in Cleveland, and Marcia and Manuel S\u00e1nchez organized in Miami.Footnote 3 Other women took on the job solo. UFWOC Vice President Dolores Huerta directed the boycott in New York City, the largest grape distribution center in the United States, and later served as East Coast boycott coordinator in 1968 and 1969. Jessica Govea, who had worked in the fields since she was nine years old and joined the UFWOC as a teenager, led boycott operations in Montreal. Maria Saudado ran the Indianapolis office, Peggy McGivern coordinated the boycott in Buffalo, and Hope Lopez directed the campaign in Philadelphia.Footnote 4 Oftentimes, women organizers were the ones who recognized the effectiveness of gendered discourse and strategy in the boycott. Knowing that women tended to be the food shoppers for their households, UFWOC boycotters used a maternalist and family-centered rhetoric that appealed to housewives\u2019 and mothers\u2019 morality. Leaflets with images of starving farmworker children accompanied demonstrators\u2019 verbal pleas for women shoppers to boycott supermarkets that sold grapes.\n\nOther groups of women workers in US history\u2014from laundresses to garment workers to miners\u2014had strategically framed their labor struggles around the preservation and well-being of family to gain more public support. The women boycotters of the UFWOC continued this legacy by arguing that although farmworkers nourished Americans by putting food on their tables, they were not making a living wage that allowed them to nourish themselves and properly feed their children. The grape boycott campaign led by Hope Lopez in Philadelphia was particularly illustrative of this maternalist, woman-centered strategy. A 41-year-old widowed, college-educated farmworker from California, Lopez arrived in Philadelphia in February 1969 with two of her five children and assistants Antonia Saludado and Carolina Franco, who were all farmworkers as well. Saludado had previously worked on boycotts in Los Angeles and New York, and Franco had been an original marcher to Sacramento and worked on boycotts in Los Angeles, New York, and Boston. Lopez and her staff conducted their campaign out of a house in Philadelphia affectionately called the \u201cGrape House,\u201d which served as both their residence and office and sheltered other boycott leaders and participants for a year and a half. The Philadelphia contingent collected endorsements for the boycott from the city\u2019s mayor, various labor unions (including the Meatcutters Union, American Federation of Teachers, and the United Auto Workers), college students, and the Catholic Archdiocese. They also welcomed assistance from women from other racial, ethnic, and class backgrounds. Middle-class white housewives volunteered their administrative services at the boycott headquarters. Maria Lina Bonet, the president and founder of the Fraternidad Puertoriquena, publicized the boycott and encouraged people to join and extend the boycott to Puerto Rican bodegas. Mary Rouse, head of the Kensington Council on Black Affairs and editor of The Informer, gave the UFWOC plenty of space to print information about the boycott in Spanish and English in the publication.Footnote 5\n\nIn targeting the large supermarket chains of Philadelphia\u2014Acme, A&P, Food Fair, Penn Fruit, and Great Scott\u2014Hope Lopez made sure to highlight the power of the woman consumer. \u201cMay I remind you,\u201d she wrote to one store manager, \u201cthat 99% of your customers are women. The ladies put you in the position of strength that you now hold and these same ladies can knock you right off that pedestal.\u201d When managers refused to budge and take grapes off their shelves, Lopez put herself in a very visible position and began a fast in late May 1969 in front of one branch of the A&P Market. Unlike Cesar Chavez\u2019s famed fast the year before, Lopez\u2019s fast had the added valence of her being a suffering mother with suffering children. To further publicize the event, an interdenominational candlelight service was planned for supporters to rally around the weakened Lopez, adding a religious aura to elicit more consumers\u2019 sympathy.Footnote 6 Other women, Latina and white, fasted as the boycott continued. The UFWOC very consciously communicated the message that women\u2014across lines of race and class\u2014needed to support each other in protecting and improving the lives of their children and families. To that end, women shoppers were encouraged to collaborate in denouncing the (mostly male) store managers who were evading their responsibility to choose ethically produced food. A&P eventually authorized its managers to remove non-union grapes but only if customers personally registered an objection. Women did just that, meeting with managers in delegations (sometimes with their children and babysitters in tow) until they caved to their demands. After an intense two-month campaign planned and carried out by Latina, black, and white women, all the major market chains in the city of Philadelphia were free of grapes.Footnote 7\n\nAs Lopez and other UFWOC organizers knew, boycott strategies needed to remain flexible enough to welcome diverse supporters from all ages, races, classes, genders, and geographies. This meant that in every city, the boycott looked somewhat different. While the Philadelphia campaign capitalized on women consumers\u2019 power, for example, the discourse of the New York boycott seemed to center on the figure of the exploited worker struggling against the wealthy and corrupt grower-businessman.Footnote 8 Young people were particularly fierce allies of the cause. The organization Students for the Grape Boycott picketed multiple supermarkets and planned numerous rallies and demonstrations, one of which was held outside the Federal Office Building in Manhattan to protest the US government being the third largest purchaser of California growers\u2019 grapes.Footnote 9 In the Columbia University area, the \u201cFriends of the Farm Workers\u201d\u2014a coalition of labor representatives, clergy members, students, and political organizations\u2014formed picket lines and distributed flyers with slogans such as \u201cPut the grapists up against the wall!\u201d that communicated how agribusiness\u2019 greed and violation of workers\u2019 rights were acts of socioeconomic violence.Footnote 10 Other tactics used in boycott cities included \u201cshop-ins\u201d (where dozens of activists entered a grocery store simultaneously, filled the bottoms of their shopping carts with grapes and stacked heavy canned products on top, and abandoned the carts at the checkout line) and \u201cpray-ins\u201d staged by Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish clergy who led groups in kneeling in supermarket aisles and praying for social peace and labor justice.Footnote 11 As more Americans joined in waving the UFWOC flag, shouting \u201cHuelga!,\u201d or wearing \u201cDon\u2019t Buy Grapes\u201d pins, people living and working outside of US borders offered their aid as well. When President Richard Nixon tried to help growers circumvent the boycott by shipping their grapes to US armed forces in Vietnam and to Europe, Mexican-American sailors threw boxes of grapes into the Gulf of Tonkin and activists across the Atlantic made sure that grapes rotted on the docks of London and Hamburg. Meanwhile, a blockade on non-union grapes extended to multiple ports in Scandinavia.Footnote 12\n\nThe cumulative effects of the boycott began to take a toll on grape sales and shipments, particularly in large urban markets. Grape shipments fell by 34 percent in New York, 41 percent in Chicago, 32 percent in Detroit, 42 percent in Boston, 53 percent in Baltimore, 23 percent in Philadelphia, and 16 percent in Los Angeles.Footnote 13 Dismayed by these numbers, the grape industry finally approached the negotiating table to begin collective bargaining talks with the UFWOC. Several companies signed union contracts during the spring of 1970. Then, in July, 27 grape growers in Delano, California, signed UFWOC contracts, finally bringing an end to a five-year strike. Giumarra Vineyards was one of these growers, and its contract ensured raises from US$ 1.65 an hour to US$ 2.05 an hour for 8000 grape workers as well as a health and welfare fund and restrictions on harmful pesticide use.Footnote 14 These concessions were the most comprehensive that any unionized group of US farmworkers had ever won, and by the end of the 1970 harvest season, the UFWOC had signed 150 table grape contracts covering 30,000 workers. The rural farmworkers\u2019 strike and the urban grape boycott campaign had worked in tandem with each other, with the latter being essential to the former\u2019s success.\n\nCelebrations would not last long, however, as the UFWOC learned that north of Delano, in the Salinas and Santa Maria Valleys, more than 170 lettuce growers had surreptitiously signed \u201csweetheart\u201d contracts with the Teamsters Union without the knowledge or consent of their workers in order to preempt the UFWOC moving into the region. The Teamsters, which had a national membership of nearly 1.5 million, covered various types of workers including field, cannery, clerical, transportation, and warehouse workers. Their leadership was largely white, making them more racially familiar to white agribusiness leaders, and their contracts often allowed grower-employers to continue using harmful chemical pesticides and importing foreign laborers if US citizen farmworkers did not agree to work under certain conditions. For these reasons, Cesar Chavez felt he had no choice but to move UFWOC headquarters to the Salinas Valley and begin a new boycott against the lettuce industry.\n\nThe UFWOC lettuce strike and boycott of 1970 has not been studied as extensively as its grape counterpart, but it was arguably larger, more violent, and involved a greater diversity of participants across lines of race, class, and citizenship. The wide array of people who made up the Salinas Valley\u2019s agricultural workforce\u2014US-born Mexican Americans, former braceros who had overstayed their contracts or naturalized as citizens, undocumented Mexican immigrants, and a small number of white, African American, and Filipino farmworkers\u2014had been following the Delano grape strike closely, and were ready to break from their imposed Teamsters contracts and join the UFWOC. Meanwhile, grower-employers doubted that their farmworkers had the political unity or capacity to carry out a successful strike. After all, they told themselves, three powerful corporations dominated the region\u2019s agriculture. The valley\u2019s largest lettuce grower was InterHarvest, a group of agricultural firms under the United Fruit Company, which was dubbed \u201cthe octopus\u201d in Latin America for its extensive control of plantations, transportation monopolies, and dictatorships. United Fruit owned InterHarvest\u2019s 20,000 acres of lettuce in Arizona and California. The Purex Corporation\u2019s farming operation Freshpict covered 42,000 acres in California, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. Finally, S.S. Pierce and Company of Boston bought out several strawberry operations in California and named this conglomerate Pic-N-Pac.Footnote 15 Growers believed that these three behemoths would not acquiesce to the demands of Chavez and a heavily Mexican-origin UFWOC membership.\n\nThese preconceived notions were shattered as thousands of Salinas Valley farmworkers signed UFWOC membership cards in the summer of 1970. Union organizer Marshall Ganz, who had organized black voters during the \u201cFreedom Summer\u201d campaign in Mississippi, recalled, \u201cIt blew me away because we had really struggled to organize workers in the grape industry\u2026[in Delano] the workers were hopeless and terrified\u2026In Salinas, all of that was different\u2026the people were ready for us.\u201dFootnote 16 Fellow organizer Jessica Govea agreed. \u201cThe Salinas workers were so much more confident than the Delano workers\u2026.There was an electricity, a vibrancy that was different.\u201dFootnote 17 In part, the organization of the lettuce economy aided in this level of worker efficiency and solidarity. Lettuce workers (or lechugueros) structured themselves differently from grape workers in that they organized themselves into crews\u2014often made up of family or friends\u2014even before being hired by an employer. Now these crews were making the collective decision to all join the UFWOC together. Along with lechugueros, crews of freseros, apieros and brocoleros (strawberry, celery, and broccoli workers) began bringing stacks of signed membership cards to union headquarters.Footnote 18 Chavez, Huerta, and their organizers believed that if they could lead hundreds of workers in walking off their jobs, this would persuade the Teamsters to informally turn over all of their farmworker contracts (representing 70,000 workers) to the UFWOC. In meetings mediated by the US Catholic Bishops Committee on Farm Labor, the UFWOC succeeded in convincing the Teamsters to do so. When these plans were presented to grower-employers, however, they refused to honor the outcomes of these mediated meetings. They argued their unionization under the Teamsters was a done deal, and ignored the UFWOC\u2019s insistence that workers never gave their consent to such representation.\n\nIn response, the UFWOC staged one of the largest agricultural strikes in American history. By August 27, 1970, 7000 farmworkers were striking against 40 Salinas Valley farming operations. Some growers went to county courts to stop the UFWOC from picketing near their fields and convinced Judge Anthony Brazil to issue a temporary restraining order against the UFWOC that kept the union from picketing at 22 farms. Citing the California Jurisdictional Strike Act, Brazil ruled that since growers technically had their workers under a union contract, the battle was between the UFWOC and Teamsters over worker jurisdiction, not between the UFWOC and the growers. Initially discouraged by these injunctions, strikers were soon heartened by the tangible economic effects of their walkout. The State and Federal Marketing Service estimated that less than half the Salinas Valley\u2019s lettuce was flowing to market, and over the next three weeks, the central coastal berry industry of California suffered an estimated US$ 2.2 million loss due to the freseros who went out on strike alongside their lechuguero comrades.Footnote 19\n\nTo put power behind its picket lines in the Salinas Valley, the UFWOC revived its successful national consumer boycott strategy in supermarkets, reappearing in cities such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal. It continued to rely on its diverse group of allies\u2014which had grown to include The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) unions, students, civil rights organizations including the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), wealthy liberal East Coast donors, anti-pesticide environmentalists, and religious leaders\u2014to help with leafleting and demonstrating in front of stores.Footnote 20 An additional tactic that Cesar Chavez deployed, which distinguished the lettuce struggle from that of the grape, was to threaten additional boycotts of other products tied to corporations that controlled the lettuce industry. Chavez threatened United Fruit\u2019s CEO Eli Black, for instance, with a worldwide boycott against all United Fruit brand products including popular Chiquita bananas, Baskin Robbins ice cream, and A&W root beer. One boycott had turned into the specter of many boycotts, and United Fruit did not want to experience a multilayered boycott of their varied food and drink products. Thus, on August 31, InterHarvest signed a UFWOC contract. The two-year agreement, which covered approximately 1000 field workers in the Salinas Valley and other parts of California and Arizona, raised hourly wages from US$ 1.85 to US$ 2.10 and piece rates from 36 cents to 40.5 cents per carton of lettuce, a huge jump compared to what workers were making under the Teamsters pact. It also contained unprecedented prohibitions against five harmful pesticides, enforced a week of paid vacations, instituted grievance procedures and a hiring hall in the place of labor contractors, and provided workers and their families with a medical insurance plan.Footnote 21 After this victory, the UFWOC won a contract with Freshpict after threatening an additional boycott against its parent company Purex, which produced bleach and other household cleaners widely used by Americans. Pic-N-Pac fell soon after, and the D\u2019Arrigo company agreed to sign a UFWOC contract by the end of November.Footnote 22 All the while, the UFWOC maintained its picket lines at farms still holding out from negotiations, and Chavez decided to expand the strike and boycott to even more Salinas Valley growers including prominent lettuce grower Bud Antle.\n\nFurious at Chavez\u2019s disregard for court orders to stop picketing growers with Teamsters contracts, Monterey County Superior Court Judge Gordon Campbell called Chavez to appear before him on December 4, 1970. Declaring Chavez guilty of contempt of court, Campbell sentenced him to a fine of 1000 dollars and imprisonment until he ended the lettuce boycott. Chavez, who had strategized and hoped for such a sentence to bring more attention to the UFWOC, was going to jail for the first time in his organizing career. Before being led away, Chavez shouted to his followers and the press, \u201cBoycott Bud Antle! Boycott Dow! And boycott the hell out of them! Viva!\u201d Dow Chemical, which had saved a financially struggling Antle in 1969 by buying 17,000 acres of farmland for a fraction of its value and then reselling it to Antle, produced dangerous pesticides as well as napalm used by the United States during the Vietnam War. By verbally connecting the two, and reiterating the threat of continued and additional boycotts, Chavez reminded the American public of agribusiness\u2019 connection to corporations that caused global suffering. In turn, he also reminded Americans that the boycott was still a tactic they could use to weaken any corporate entity that was taking away the labor and civil rights of vulnerable and marginalized people.Footnote 23 The UFWOC lettuce strike and boycott continued to emphasize their ties to other rights movements and well-known allies. Ethel Kennedy and Coretta Scott King, both widows of leaders associated with the civil rights movement, paid separate visits to the Salinas Valley to see Chavez in his jail cell and speak to UFWOC members. Three weeks into Chavez\u2019s jail time, the California Supreme Court ordered his release and removed the bans on the UFWOC strike and boycott. The lettuce strike and boycott continued until late March 1971, when the UFWOC and the Teamsters signed a three-year agreement allowing the former to take over all farmworker contracts in the region.\n\nThroughout the early 1970s, the UFWOC (renamed the United Farm Workers in 1972) continued to earn impressive wage raises, pesticide bans, and medical plans for its members. These gains, however, needed constant maintenance. After union contracts won in 1970 expired in 1973, several grape and lettuce growers resisted renegotiation with the UFWOC and signed contracts with the Teamsters again without elections or their employees\u2019 consent. Some firms shut down or reopened under new names to stop or stall the unionization process. Other grower-employers turned back to labor contractors as middlemen figures who could hire their employees for them, which would permit them to evade dealing with union representatives altogether. The United Farm Workers (UFW) boycotts began again, now against the grape, wine, and lettuce industries combined. As scholar Heidi Tinsman has noted, these 1973 boycotts took place against the backdrop of another relevant boycott. A Chile solidarity movement alliance of leftists, academics, religious institutions, labor unions, and Chilean refugees in the United States began a boycott of Chilean imports (including grapes and wine) in 1973 to protest Allende\u2019s overthrow and Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship. Unfortunately, the UFW and Chile boycott organizers did not collaborate as much as they could have, given the connections between their two movements. Both protested injustices against Spanish-speaking people, and New York and California agribusiness interests were actually investors, importers, and promoters of Chilean grapes throughout the decade.Footnote 24\n\nAnd although young people had always been a part of the UFW\u2019s struggle, other historians have remarked on children\u2019s participation in the 1973 boycotts. Wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the UFW\u2019s black eagle symbol and standing by their parents, children passed out leaflets at grocery stores selling non-union produce and Gallo wines (Gallo being a major grape grower) and pleaded with customers to shop elsewhere. Their young faces and voices turned dozens of sympathetic people away each day they demonstrated.Footnote 25 The UFW did not let the power of their youngest members go unnoticed, and began offering \u201cresource kits\u201d to teachers in primary schools that explained the union\u2019s and boycott\u2019s objectives. Teachers then instructed students to write letters or send drawings to Cesar Chavez himself or the UFW\u2019s newspaper El Malcriado. Students even boycotted their own school cafeterias if they discovered non-union produce being served there. After completing these exercises in their schools, these children often went home and told their parents and grandparents about the boycott, doing the intergenerational publicity work that the UFW hoped they would.Footnote 26 Entire families, particularly Mexican-American families, continued the legacy of traveling for the union and coordinating boycott campaigns. In 1968, Maria Luisa Rangel had moved her family of nine to Detroit, Michigan, for the grape boycott. In 1970, Juanita Valdez convinced her husband and seven children to come with her to Cincinnati, Ohio, for the lettuce campaign. In 1973, Herminia Rodriguez relocated her family of six to Washington, DC, for the grape, lettuce, and wine boycotts.Footnote 27 The farmworker struggle had always been about families\u2019 work, and UFW members knew that a successful strike and boycott required families\u2019 work as well.\n\nAs much as UFW leaders cared about the boycott, they made sure to stay active in the legislative sphere and fought for the passage of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act in June 1975 that gave California farmworkers the right to choose their union representatives through elections. When UFW contracts with lettuce growers expired again in 1979, the strike-boycott combination was resuscitated once more and resulted in 125 new contracts for 30,000 workers that raised starting wages for farmworkers by 40 percent to US$ 5.25 an hour and instituted an improved medical plan, paid vacations, pesticide restrictions, and employer-paid union representatives to monitor workers\u2019 conditions locally.Footnote 28 These 1979 victories, however, were the final peak in the UFW\u2019s organizing history. Soon after, Chavez\u2019s plaguing paranoia about losing his total authority over the union drove him to purge some of the union\u2019s most valuable leaders and the paid union representatives in the fields. By the early 1980s, many alienated UFW members had left the organization.Footnote 29 Moreover, the UFW failed to adapt to the demographic shifts in the United States during the 1980s\u2014particularly, an influx of new migrants and refugees from southern Mexico and Central America\u2014which meant a lost opportunity to organize the foreign-born workers who replaced Mexican Americans as the dominant agricultural workforce. Undocumented immigrants, who made up a sizeable portion of this new laboring population, were very reluctant to protest their wages and conditions or join a union.\n\nThe UFW launched a third boycott against California grapes in the mid-1980s that focused on pesticide use. In 1986, it distributed a video called The Wrath of Grapes that spliced images of Latino children born without limbs (birth defects thought to result from the mother\u2019s exposure to pesticides) with footage of field and vineyard workers being sprayed with chemicals from low-flying planes. This boycott campaign asked consumers to stop buying California grapes until growers agreed to ban five widely used pesticides and herbicides and allow fair union elections.Footnote 30 The boycott did not succeed in gaining any contracts\u2014rather, the number of farmworkers covered by UFW contracts fell over the rest of the decade due to the aforementioned demographic shifts and internal union strife, as well as a changed political climate under the presidency of Ronald Reagan and the ever-deepening pockets of agribusiness (the California Table Grape Commission devoted a whopping US$ 250,000 annually to advertising against the UFW boycott). In dramatic contrast to the UFW\u2019s first grape boycott in the 1960s, which lowered national sales of grapes by 20 percent, the average American was convinced by slick advertising to go from consuming an average of four pounds of grapes in 1980 to almost eight pounds in 1990.Footnote 31 Chavez\u2019s unexpected death in 1993 suspended the boycott, and the UFW turned over to his son-in-law Arturo Rodriguez. Recently a new president, Teresa Romero, has taken over the union\u2019s reigns, and she will continue to face the challenge of reviving the UFW\u2019s influence as it represents only a fraction of the farmworkers that it used to.\n\nSome have critiqued the UFW\u2019s strike-and-boycott strategy for having limited objectives and impact. While boycotts in cities did drum up enough consumer support to bring growers to the negotiating table for union contracts, these short-term agreements only gave farmworkers power for a few years at a time and not permanently. The great public response to supermarket boycotts in the 1960s and 1970s was never harnessed into legislative change at the federal level, and laws were not created that bestowed agricultural laborers with more rights or curtailed the power and freedom of agribusiness. The American agricultural industry has continued to evade the institution of a minimum wage, overtime pay, and collective bargaining rights for farmworkers, and field work is still characterized by a lack of rest breaks, water, and sanitary facilities. Sexual harassment is prevalent, complaining workers are threatened with firing or deportation, and hundreds of thousands of US farmworkers suffer from pesticide poisoning each year. Individual states have passed minimum wage and safety laws for farmworkers, but the federal neglect of these laborers that began in the New Deal era persists to the present day."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-nov-22-mn-55663-story.html", "page_content": "TIMES STAFF WRITER\n\n\u201cNo Grapes!\u201d--a spirited rallying cry of the labor movement and the political left for much of the last four decades--officially receded into history Tuesday as the United Farm Workers of America declared an end to its protracted boycott of California table grapes.\n\nThe announcement by UFW President Arturo S. Rodriguez makes official what had already become a fait accompli; the union and even its loyal followers had mostly lost interest in the sanction against the state\u2019s grape growers.\n\nRodriguez said he ended the UFW\u2019s third grape boycott, which began 16 years ago, because of a recent string of farm worker victories that included the elimination of many of the pesticides the embargo had targeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSome goals of that boycott have already been met,\u201d Rodriguez said in a letter to a farm worker support group. \u201cCesar Chavez\u2019s crusade to eliminate use of five of the most toxic chemicals plaguing farm workers and their families has been largely successful.\n\n\u201cIt is not fair to ask our supporters to honor a boycott,\u201d Rodriguez said, \u201cwhen the union must devote all of its present resources toward organizing and negotiating contracts.\u201d\n\nFarm industry leaders welcomed the announcement, but said they believe that the union\u2019s move amounts to a concession that the boycott has failed to hurt the ever-expanding table grape business.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that it never worked. It wasn\u2019t effective,\u201d said Bob Krauter, a spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation. \u201cThe union just had to have something to say when they called it off.\u201d\n\nThe boycott that ended this week was a pale imitation of two earlier union table grape sanctions, which galvanized farm workers and liberals as Chavez created the nation\u2019s first viable agricultural union.\n\nThe first boycott began in Delano, Calif., in 1963, as the fledgling union attempted to pressure growers to sign union contracts. UFW activists traveled in caravans to cities across America. They picketed in front of supermarkets, raising consciousness about farm workers and becoming a favorite cause for college activists. Chavez called off that first boycott in 1970, with the union in triumph and contracts in place with the state\u2019s largest grape growers.\n\nBut three years later, the boycott began again, this time with the UFW on the defensive after losing most of its labor agreements to the Teamsters Union, which signed sweetheart deals with growers.\n\nThe second grape boycott overlapped with the union\u2019s call for consumers to shun two other nonunion products--lettuce and Gallo wines. Bumper stickers reading \u201cNo Grapes\u201d (or, in Spanish, \u201cNo Uvas\u201d), or criticizing lettuce growers or the giant winemaker seemed like a standard issue for many progressive activists.\n\nAgain, a small army of activists traveled across the country to promote the boycotts. One survey indicated that as many as 17 million Americans weren\u2019t buying grapes, union officials said.\n\nIn 1977, Chavez removed the sanctions against grapes, lettuce and Gallo wines, again in apparent triumph, after the passage of a California farm labor law that was considered the strongest in the nation.\n\nIt was in 1984 that the UFW leadership launched the third and longest grape boycott, one that never had the focus or public support of its predecessors. The union shifted the target of the strike--first urging Gov. George Deukmejian to improve enforcement of the farm labor law, then demanding more contracts with grape growers and, finally, concentrating on the pesticide issue.\n\nAt age 61 Chavez conducted his longest public fast--the 36-day \u201cFast for Life\u201d--and continued to press the boycott until his death five years later in 1993.\n\nThe third boycott initially was promoted in UFW mailers to millions of households, but it never evoked the door-to-door spirit of its predecessors. Over the years, the union devoted progressively less attention to the boycott. Even some activists weren\u2019t sure if the ban on grapes remained in place.\n\n\u201cOne boycott is on and the other is off. It\u2019s constantly shifting,\u201d said Phil Martin, a professor of agricultural economics at UC Davis. \u201cIt becomes too complicated for the average person to figure out.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, union leader Rodriguez said that three pesticides that most concerned Chavez--Dinoseb, parathion and Phosdrin--are no longer used in the fields. A fourth pesticide, methyl bromide, is to be phased out and a fifth, Captan, is under much greater restriction.\n\nThose developments and the signing of a string of union contracts in recent years were reason enough to drop the boycott and focus attention on other issues, said Rodriguez, in what the union called \u201ca message timed for Thanksgiving.\u201d\n\nBut grape growers said their business appeared to be unaffected by the UFW\u2019s long campaign. Production increased 40% to 660,000 tons over the last 16 years and the cash value of the California grape crop more than doubled to $382 million, industry officials said.\n\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t hindered or restricted sales at all,\u201d Krauter said.\n\nThe end of the grape boycott leaves in place just one UFW boycott--on mushrooms from the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in Ventura. The UFW has called on consumers not to buy the mushrooms since last summer, part of the union\u2019s long-running effort to win a contract for 300 Pictsweet workers. Since the boycott, both Vons and the Ralphs Grocery Co. have stopped carrying Pictsweet.\n\nProving that old habits die hard, some union activists said they would continue to shun table grapes.\n\n\u201cTable grape workers continue to suffer poverty pay, poor working conditions and mistreatment on the job,\u201d said UFW spokesman Marc Grossman. \u201cWe look forward to the day where table grape workers too can enjoy the blessings of organized labor.\u201d\n\n*\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://billofrightsinstitute.org/essays/cesar-chavez-dolores-huerta-and-the-united-farm-workers", "page_content": "Written by: Jason Pierce, Angelo State University\n\nBy the end of this section, you will: Explain the continuities and changes in immigration patterns over time\n\nExplain how and why various groups responded to calls for the expansion of civil rights from 1960 to 1980\n\nSuggested Sequencing Use this Narrative with the Art as Protest: Images from the United Farm Workers of America, 1973-1978Primary Source while talking about the various civil rights movements occurring during the 1970s.\n\nC\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez was born near Yuma, Arizona, in 1927, on the farm his grandparents had settled in the 1880s. Like thousands of others, his family lost their land during the Great Depression, forcing them to join throngs of itinerant laborers crowding California in search of work. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s childhood as a migrant farmworker would forever shape him as he experienced firsthand the injustices of brutally long hours, back-breaking labor, corrupt labor contractors who deducted high rents from workers\u2019 pay, and extremely low wages. Worse, although the Depression led to the creation of new labor laws, including the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, many of those protections did not apply to farm workers.\n\nWar ended the suffering of the Depression, and Ch\u00e1vez joined the U.S. Navy in 1944, at the age of 17. After his discharge, he returned to Delano, California, a community in the San Joaquin Valley famous for its table grapes. There he met and married Helen Fabela in 1948, and together the couple had seven children. In 1952, Ch\u00e1vez met Fred Ross, an organizer for the Community Service Organization (CSO), who was allied with radical Saul Alinsky\u2019s Industrial Areas Foundation. Alinsky, a community organizer and activist, wanted poor people to organize and become politically active to pressure governments to be more attentive to their needs. Alinsky and Ross hoped to convince farmworkers to organize, and Ch\u00e1vez, despite having only an eighth-grade education, became a powerful speaker and leader in the CSO. Although he broke with the organization in 1962, his experiences informed his creation of theUnited Farm Workers (UFW).\n\nCh\u00e1vez\u2019s decision to create a farmworker\u2019s union changed his life and the lives of migrant workers in the United States. Dolores Huerta, a fellow CSO organizer, was the first person he approached to assist in the creation of the National Farm Workers Association (NWFA). It was a collaboration that would endure for the rest of his life. Two years later, the NWFA had more than 1,000 members, mostly in California. Ch\u00e1vez and Huerta hoped a union of farmworkers could agitate for higher wages and help with rising rents in migrant camps (as migrants, they rented houses or campsites, often from the very people for whom they labored).\n\nIn 1965, the NFWA joined several other organizations in a strike against grape growers in Delano that began with Filipino workers from the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC). The Filipino workers were upset that they received only $1.25 per hour compared with the $1.40 hourly wage of farmworkers who were part of the bracero program (a guest worker program started during World War II). Embracing the principles of nonviolence that Martin Luther King Jr. endorsed, the groups staged strikes and protests. In addition, they organized a successful consumer boycott of grapes that attracted international attention. In 1970, the growers relented and signed labor contracts with the strikers. Never before had migrant workers won such a major victory. By this time, the NFWA and AWOC had merged into the United Farm Workers.\n\nThe flag and logo of the United Farm Workers (UFW), a black stylized eagle with wings shaped like an inverted Aztec pyramid.\n\nSoft-spoken and thoughtful, Ch\u00e1vez had a leadership style marked by his devout Catholicism. He staged a march from Southern California to the state capitol in Sacramento, which he saw as a kind of spiritual penanceas much as a way of raising awareness for farmworkers\u2019 rights. In 1968, after a UFW protest turned violent, Ch\u00e1vez staged a hunger strike as punishment for himself and his movement, the first of several hunger strikes he would undertake during his life. His commitment to nonviolence and justice won him many supporters. But every leader needs good lieutenants who can make up for their shortcomings, and Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s number two, Dolores Huerta, was molded from tougher material.\n\nHuerta grew up in a poor but diverse neighborhood in Stockton, California. Her single mother worked hard to support her and her two brothers. Her mother eventually opened a restaurant and hotel, which provided a lower-middle-class income for her children. Dolores, meanwhile, excelled in school, but societal expectations were low for Mexican American women. Following her mother\u2019s example, she became a fiercely independent woman who saw herself as equal to men. After graduating high school, she attended community college but eventually dropped out, marrying her high school sweetheart in 1950. Not unlike feminist leader Betty Friedan, Huerta found herself wanting more and, as her marriage failed, she threw herself into civic organizations. These women\u2019s organizations, however, did not address deeper social issues (e.g., poverty and racism) that increasingly drew her attention. Eventually, she joined the CSO, where she met Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nDolores Huerta remains an activist for social justice today. In 2012, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama.\n\nHuerta\u2019s contributions toLa Causa (the cause of farm workers rights) were many. She excelled at organization and detail, much more than Ch\u00e1vez. She believed in tackling issues head-on and was comfortable handling many confrontations. She and Ch\u00e1vez argued incessantly, and although she deferred to him publicly, in private she made her opinions known. She tangled with other leaders of the UFW, its members, and, of course, the growers. Such behavior was shocking in the Mexican American community, where women were not supposed to be active and assertive in public. Huerta\u2019s strength of personality, however, undoubtedly helped propel the UFW forward.\n\nAfter several successful boycotts, the UFW turned to raising awareness of other issues facing immigrant workers. California, pressured by the UFW, passed the first law governing farm-labor organizing, which eventually led to the establishment of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB). Ch\u00e1vez endorsed the California law and became friendly with the new Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, who supported it. The law, passed in 1975, included provisions such as the right to boycott and strike, union voting rights for seasonal workers, and secret-ballot union elections.\n\nAlthough the UFW had success in the 1970s, the 1980s brought challenges. The new presidential administration of Ronald Reagan (a former governor of California) opposed unions, and many in the American public had come to agree with his view. Unions struggled with internal corruption and other problems in the 1980s, and deindustrialization changed the nature of work for millions of Americans with the loss of factories that were going overseas. Even protests, strikes, and boycotts, the UFW\u2019s chief tools, came to be seen as relics from the turbulent 1960s. In California, the ALRB was packed with pro-grower representatives who stifled the efforts of the UFW in labor disputes. Internal strife also plagued the union, with several high-profile leaders leaving, and union membership declined from a high of 30,000 in 1976 to only 12,000 by the early 1980s.\n\nWorse, growers increasingly turned to undocumented workers for labor. Mexican nationals had legally worked in the fields since the bracero program of World War II, but increasingly people arrived without work visas, and their legal status made it impossible for the UFW to organize them. Growers could pay these workers less and undercut the UFW. The union tried to dissuade migrants from crossing illegally into the United States, but these efforts largely failed. Ch\u00e1vez accused the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)of working with growers to allow illegal immigrants to enter the country, and he demanded stricter enforcement of immigration laws to curtail illegal immigration.\n\nC\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s nonviolent efforts for farmworkers led many to compare him to Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe issue of pesticide poisoning offered Ch\u00e1vez a chance to revitalize the union and return it to the national spotlight. Many farmworkers, exposed to pesticides while working in the fields, were coming into medical clinics with symptoms of poisoning. Although the potential dangers of pesticides had first reached the public consciousness two decades earlier with Rachel Carson\u2019s bestselling book Silent Spring, the effects on farmworkers had never caught the public\u2019s interest before. Ch\u00e1vez figured he could attract the attention of Americans by focusing on the dangers of pesticides to workers and consumers. The UFW staged a new grape boycott and produced a film titled The Wrath of Grapes (a pun on the classic John Steinbeck novel of the Depression, The Grapes of Wrath). The union also organized marches and protests, and Ch\u00e1vez staged another high-profile hunger strike. For 36 days he subsisted entirely on water.\n\nAlthough Huerta claimed the hunger strike was \u201ca spiritual thing with him,\u201d it also had the effect of refocusing national attention on the UFW\u2019s call to boycott grapes. Celebrities, including actor Martin Sheen, participated in their own shorter hunger strikes to raise awareness. Although the boycott did hurt growers, it did not achieve Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s larger goal of revitalizing the union. Lawsuits by growers also hurt the UFW, including a 1991 court decision that the UFW pay a fine of $2.4 million in damages from a 1979 strike. To deal with these problems, Ch\u00e1vez continued his usual frenetic pace of work. Another fast took too much out of him, however, and his friends convinced him to break it early. That evening, April 23, 1993, he retreated to bed exhausted and passed away in his sleep.\n\nAlthough Ch\u00e1vez is remembered as the creator of an important union and a champion of social justice, in death he became much more. President Bill Clinton called him an \u201cauthentic hero,\u201d and for Latinos, especially Mexican Americans, he became an icon and an inspiration. His rallying cry \u201cSi se puede\u201d (\u201cYes, we can\u201d) continues to inspire social reformers today."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/news/latino-labor-movement-strikes-cesar-chavez", "page_content": "When it comes to the fight for workers\u2019 rights in the United States, Latino Americans have been critical players since the early 1900s. Their organizing and agitating have led to improved working conditions and wages in industries across the U.S.\n\n\u201cLatinos have been part of the long history of the construction of this country and this labor force,\u201d especially in the American West, says Gaspar Rivera-Salgado, project director at UCLA\u2019s Center for Labor Research and Education. \u201cThey were part of the completion of the transcontinental railroad. They were part of the early Los Angeles building boom.\u201d And of course they have had a profound impact on the massive world of American food production, where they have been heavily represented both in the fields and in processing plants.\n\nLatino workers\u2019 fight for protections and living wages has been an uphill one, weighted with layers of discrimination. \u201cThe great expansion of labor rights in the 1930s during the [Franklin D. Roosevelt] administration, which led to the creation of the National Labor Board, specifically excluded farmworkers and domestic workers from the right to create unions,\u201d says Rivera-Salgado. It\u2019s an outcome he attributes to a legacy of racial subjugation against African Americans who had long labored in America\u2019s fields.\n\nThe result: Even after the agricultural labor force shifted to largely Latino workers, they still lacked basic protections well into the 1970s. \u201cThe conditions were horrendous,\u201d says Rivera-Salgado. \u201cThat\u2019s why they wanted a union\u2014to secure basic wages and also basic conditions in the fields,\u201d like injury protections on the job and access to restrooms.\n\nHere are five strikes either led or co-led by Hispanic and Latino Americans that helped make U.S. workplaces safer.\n\nPHOTOS: These Appalling Images Exposed Child Labor in America\n\nThe Oxnard Strike (1903)\n\nLibrary of Congress Workers unloading beets from wagons at the American Beet Sugar Company in Oxnard, California, circa 1910.\n\nOne of the first agriculture strikes in the United States also represented an unprecedented moment in multi-racial coalition building, when Japanese and Mexican farm laborers banded together to defeat bosses who had long exploited their workers\u2019 racial and cultural divisions.\n\nThe American sugar industry ground to a halt on February 11, 1903, when workers in the sugar boomtown of Oxnard, California joined to form the Japanese-Mexican Labor Association (JMLA) and organize a work stoppage at the height of sugar beet season. Their grievances? The region\u2019s white farmers had colluded with the American Beet Sugar Company\u2014Oxnard\u2019s main employer\u2014to drastically cut wages, already diminished by a parasitic labor subcontracting system. The sugar firm also required workers to buy all their goods in overpriced company-owned stores.\n\n\u201cThey lowered the wages for clearing an acre from $5 to $2.50, and they lowered the basic base wage,\u201d says Tom\u00e1s Almaguer, professor emeritus of ethnic studies at San Francisco State University, who has written about the 1903 Oxnard strike.\n\nIn reaction to this sharp pay cut, a coalition of about 500 Japanese and 200 Mexican workers demanded that their original pay scale be restored. JMLA\u2019s membership eventually grew to some 1,200 workers, or about 90 percent of Oxnard\u2019s labor force, according to a history of the strike by the United Food & Commercial Workers Union.\n\n\u201cIt was the first time in both California and United States history that agriculture workers were not only successful in organizing\u2014but in winning\u2014a strike,\u201d says Almaguer. One reason: The Japanese laborers, heavily recruited after the Chinese Exclusion Act diminished the Chinese workforce in America, tended to be well educated, \u201cso they were not as vulnerable to taking labor abuse,\u201d says Almaguer. Another reason: Workers from the different ethnic groups refused to be divided, even using translators to coordinate their efforts and demands. After a violent confrontation during the strike left one Mexican worker dead, management conceded to union demands for better pay and axing the subcontracting system. The strike \u201creally foreshadowed 30, 60 years of labor organizing by farmworkers in California,\u201d says Almaguer. \u201cIt is\u2026foundational in terms of that history.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Minimum Wage in America: A Timeline\n\nThe El Monte Berry Strike (1933)\n\nCorbis/Getty Images A group of Mexican farm workers protest from the back of a truck during a strike in California, 1933.\n\nOn June 1, 1933, at the height of the Great Depression, 1,500 workers in El Monte, California\u2019s berry fields walked out to demand higher wages and better working conditions. While the work stoppage was part of a larger series of strikes organized by the Cannery and Agricultural Workers\u2019 Industrial Union (CAWIU) that summer, the El Monte labor action gained widespread attention because it was instantly seen as a threat to Southern California\u2019s booming agricultural industry.\n\nThe strike also shed sharp light on long-simmering racial tensions between the town\u2019s Mexican, Japanese and white residents, all segregated by local laws. After the Depression caused El Monte\u2019s white landowners to struggle, they began subleasing small plots of land to Japanese farmers who would grow berries, melons and vegetables as cash crops\u2014tended to primarily by members of El Monte\u2019s Mexican migrant worker community, which comprised about 20 percent of the region\u2019s population. Class divides and resentment arose between the Mexican workers, who lived in temporary worker camps, and the Japanese American population, which primarily lived on small family farms.\n\nWhen wages for berry pickers continued to drop\u2014to as little as nine cents an hour, some claimed\u2014desperate workers began demanding a minimum wage of 35 cents an hour. Berry picker Jesusita Torres was quoted in the book From Out of the Shadows: Mexican Women in Twentieth-century America about how she sometimes earned less than one penny per basket of berries during this period.\n\nAssisted by a handful of organizers from the national CAWIU, a coalition of El Monte workers called a walkout at the height of the already short berry season\u2014with immediate impact. The Japanese community rallied around its tenant farmers by helping tend the fields themselves. Local political leaders denounced the involvement of the CAWIU, whose communist philosophies and aggressive anti-scab tactics also increasingly unnerved local El Monte laborers. The Mexican consulate even got involved, threatening strikers connected to communist activity with deportation.\n\nThe El Monte strikers eventually broke from CAWIU, facilitating negotiations between them, the farm owners and the town. The parties eventually agreed to end the strike after establishing a base daily wage of $1.50 and guaranteeing that workers would be rehired without repercussions. But while the farmworkers declared victory, poor working conditions in El Monte remained pervasive.\n\nREAD MORE: Why the Great Steel Strike of 1919 Was One of Labor's Biggest Failures\n\nPecan Shellers\u2019 Strike (1938)\n\nSome strikes were led by women, for women. One such action occurred at San Antonio\u2019s Southern Pecan Shelling Company\u2019s factories, where 21-year-old Emma Tenayuca, a Mexican American labor activist, began organizing the predominantly Latina work force. An activist since she was a 16-year-old picketing in support of the city\u2019s cigar factory workers, Tenayuca became known as \u201cLa Pasionaria\u201d for her efforts on behalf of Latina women working low-wage jobs.\n\nOn January 31, 1938, nearly 12,000 San Antonio pecan shellers launched a three-month strike\u2014in a state responsible for 50 percent of America\u2019s pecan production. The women were protesting dangerous working conditions that included breathing in pecan dust in badly lit factories with poor ventilation, being forced to work in facilities without indoor restrooms or sinks, and low pay being slashed from seven to six cents per pound of nuts. And according to the Texas State Historical Association, San Antonio\u2019s high tuberculosis rate\u2014almost triple the national average\u2014came, in part, from the city\u2019s pecan shellers constantly breathing in dust at work.\n\nStrikers met immediate hostility from San Antonio\u2019s local officials. The city\u2019s police chief and Catholic archbishop attributed the strike to a \u201cred plot\u201d by communists, while the Department of Health blocked strikers from receiving food-bank assistance. Aggressive police treatment of the strikers drew national and international attention, prompting the Mexican government to protest reports of a 60-year-old Mexican woman being clubbed by police while walking past a shelling factory with her toddler grandchild. When several picketers were subjected to mass arrest, the Texas governor called on the state industrial commission to investigate whether the workers\u2019 civil rights were violated.\n\n\u201cWhat started out as an organization for equal wages turned into a mass movement against starvation, for civil rights, for a minimum-wage law,\u201d Tenayuca said in a 1987 interview.\n\nBut while the San Antonio establishment virulently opposed the strikers, national sentiment skewed positive. National Labor Secretary Frances Perkins expressed support for the shellers\u2019 plight, asking \u201cDo you in San Antonio call that wages?\u201d after hearing about how their already low rates were being cut. Attention to the shellers\u2019 working conditions became part of the national conversation shifting in favor of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, which created the 40-hour work week, established the minimum wage and guaranteed overtime for many workers.\n\nThe pecan shellers\u2019 strike ended in March 1938, after both sides agreed to set a minimum wage of seven to eight cents per pound of nuts. But despite their broader gains, the shellers\u2019 workplace benefits proved short-lived. After the passage of the Fair Labor Act, the Southern Pecan Shelling Company\u2019s owner converted the factory to mechanized pecan shelling to avoid paying the minimum wage.\n\nREAD MORE: How the Horrific Tragedy of the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire Led to Workplace Safety Laws\n\nThe Delano Grape Strike (1965)\n\nArthur Schatz/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images Labor activist Cesar Chavez (center) talking in a field with grape pickers in support of the United Farm Workers Union, 1968.\n\nC\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, one of the best-known labor organizers in U.S. history, earned renown in 1965, after working to unionize largely Latino grape pickers in Delano, California. First begun by Filipino American organizer Larry Itliong to protest the poor pay and hazardous working conditions faced by grape pickers, the Delano strike lasted five years and led to the creation of the United Farm Workers of America. Just as significantly, the highly visible campaigns by Chavez, Dolores Huerta and other organizers changed for the better how many Americans viewed the migrant workers who harvested the fruits and vegetables they ate.\n\n\u201cC\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez was known for being very charismatic, but he was also very astute,\u201d says Rivera-Salgado. To spotlight to the isolated farming community of Delano, California, Chavez organized a series of events designed to draw widespread media attention. One was a 340-mile march, in which 75 Mexican and Filipino farmworkers trekked from Delano to Sacramento. After 25 days, Ch\u00e1vez and the others were greeted in the state capital by 10,000 supporters.\n\nA student of the nonviolent methods used by Mahatma Gandhi and others, Ch\u00e1vez urged strikers to resist violence, even when deliberately provoked by growers and police. In late 1968, he went on a water-only fast lasting 25 days to draw attention to police brutality against strikers.\n\nCh\u00e1vez also solicited support from prominent labor and civil rights activists from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), whose members saw parallels between Latino farmworkers\u2019 struggle for labor rights and Black Americans\u2019 struggle for civil rights. They related to how the striking workers faced violence, overpolicing and, in Chavez\u2019s case, secret FBI investigations.\n\nBoth SNCC and CORE proved instrumental in rallying Americans to boycott grapes from Delano until the strike succeeded. Ch\u00e1vez also managed to convince the initially skeptical Senator Robert Kennedy to support the Delano strike. \u201cOne of the great achievements of C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez was to link the plight of farmworkers with a basic sense of justice and the expansion of civil rights,\u201d says Rivera-Salgado. \u201cHe viewed the fight of farmworkers as not only a fight for better working conditions, but as a fight for dignity.\u201d\n\nThe strike ended July 29, 1970, when California grape growers signed a union contract with the newly formed United Farm Workers guaranteeing Delano\u2019s farmworkers better pay, worker protections and benefits. The Delano strike also led to the passage of the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, which further guaranteed safer workplaces for the state\u2019s farmworkers. Rivera-Salgado notes that the UFW\u2019s achievements in Delano were all the more remarkable because there were no federal protections for farmworkers when the strike started. \u201cThese changes were made possible because of activism,\u201d he says.\n\nREAD MORE: When Millions of Americans Stopped Eating Grapes in Support of Farm Workers\n\nImmokalee Workers\u2019 Hunger Strike (2003)\n\nNuri Vallbona/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images \"When we say that the tomatoes that leave Immokalee have sweat, have blood, we are not exaggerating,\" says Lucas Benitez, a staff member of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, who saved the bloodied shirt of a farm worker who was beaten in 1996.\n\nWhile a century's worth of farmworker activism improved the world of American agriculture, laborers have continued to battle well into the 21 century\u2014for healthcare, fair wages and protections against the effects of harmful pesticides. \u201cDespite the successes of the civil rights movement and the women\u2019s movement, this population remains to this day among the most vulnerable and the most highly exploited,\u201d says Almaguer.\n\nThe Coalition of Immokalee Workers in Florida formed in the 1990s to address continuing exploitation in Florida, the nation\u2019s largest tomato producing state. In the late \u201990s, they organized a series of work stoppages designed to draw attention to a decades-long stagnation in workers' wages\u2014still calculated by the weight of produce picked. But after initially focusing on lobbying Florida\u2019s tomato growers, the Coalition in 2001 pivoted to top tomato buyers, to leverage their market power. Targeting U.S. fast-food chains\u2014specifically Taco Bell, which purchased 10 million pounds of tomatoes from Florida annually\u2014the Coalition pressured chains to support raising wages for migrant farmworkers by one cent per pound of tomatoes. They did this, in part, by organizing a \u201cBoot the Bell\u201d campaign encouraging high schools and colleges to boycott the fast-food purveyor.\n\nTo spotlight their demands, Coalition members staged one of the largest hunger strikes in U.S. labor history in 2003 outside Taco Bell\u2019s California headquarters, where more than 75 farmworkers and students fasted over 10 days. Media attention from the hunger strike and other actions intensified pressure on Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands to address wages for tomato farmworkers. Two years later, in 2005, Yum! and CIW leaders came to an agreement to improve farmworker wages. \u201cWe recognize that Florida tomato workers do not enjoy the same rights and conditions as employees in other industries,\u201d said Taco Bell\u2019s then-president Emil Brolick, \u201cand there is a need for reform.\u201d"}]}
