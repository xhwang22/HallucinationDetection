Tobin, the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 defensive coordinator last season, is the Cardinals\u2019 fifth coach since the team moved to Arizona from St. Louis in 1988.\n\nTobin, 52, replaced Ryan, who was fired Dec. 26 after two seasons and a 12-20 record. Tobin replaced Ryan in 1986 as defensive coordinator for the Chicago Bears when Ryan became coach of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe new coach said he was optimistic about putting together a winning team quickly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think the nucleus of this team is such that we can put together an excellent team in a very short period,\u201d he said.\n\nTobin demurred when asked if he was saying there was \u201ca winner in town,\u201d the now infamous way Ryan described himself when he was hired Feb. 3, 1994.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never gone into a game or a season thinking we couldn\u2019t win,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cNow, is that a goal? I don\u2019t know, but the only purpose of coaching or playing in the National Football League is to win, is to want to get to the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\n*\n\nMore than 125,000 screaming fans lined a downtown parade route to hail the Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys, who glided by on silver and blue floats. With fans decked out in Cowboys colors and waving pompons, the players--including quarterback Troy Aikman, whose right arm was bandaged one day after arthroscopic elbow surgery--rode atop more than a half dozen floats along the 1 1/2-mile course.\n\nCalgary Stampeder quarterback Doug Flutie has been given permission by the Canadian Football League to sign with the Toronto Argonauts.\n\nFlutie\u2019s contract with Calgary runs through 1999, but CFL commissioner Larry Smith has pressured the Stampeders into trading the 1984 Heisman Trophy winner to Toronto for the sake of the league.\n\nBaseball\n\nIn what would be the first trade between American and Japanese major league teams, the Boston Red Sox are discussing a deal to acquire pitcher Robinson Checo from the Hiroshima Toyo Carp after the 1996 season for a player to be named later and perhaps some cash.\n\nFirst baseman David Segui agreed to terms of a two-year deal with the Montreal Expos, avoiding a arbitration hearing scheduled earlier in the day in Chicago. Terms of the new contract weren\u2019t disclosed, but the figures submitted for arbitration showed that the Expos offered $1.1 million a season while Segui had requested $2 million.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs came to terms with the last of their arbitration-eligible players, agreeing to a $1.6 million, one-year contract with pitcher Frank Castillo. Castillo, 27, asked for a salary of $2.18 million when he filed for arbitration. The Cubs countered with an offer of $1.2 million.\n\nThe New York Yankees signed reliever Jeff Nelson to a two-year contract, avoiding salary arbitration with the right-hander. He was acquired as part of the trade that sent first baseman Tino Martinez to New York in exchange for left-hander Sterling Hitchcock and third baseman Russell Davis. . . . The New York Mets signed utility man Jerry Browne to a minor league contract and invited him to spring training as a nonroster player. . . . The Kansas City Royals re-signed pitcher Dave Fleming to a minor league contract and invited him to spring training as a nonroster player.\n\nMiscellany\n\nRandall Evans won the 50-meter sprint at the World Class track and field meet in Moscow and fellow American, Andre Cason, finished third. Ukrainian Sergei Osovich was second.\n\nNamibia\u2019s Frank Fredericks won the 60-200 sprint double in 6.52 and 20.37 seconds at the Coke indoor track meet in Ghent, Belgium, and Russia\u2019s Irina Privalova opened her winter season with a convincing victory in the 60-meter dash.\n\nEurope\u2019s most powerful soccer clubs backed away from a super league and threw their support behind the European governing body\u2019s planned changes for three club competitions.\n\nIn a meeting with the owners of 33 clubs, including AC Milan, Ajax of Amsterdam, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United, UEFA president Lennart Johansson said the idea of a super league, suggested by Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein, wasn\u2019t that warmly received.\n\nJeff Lukas, thoroughbred horse trainer who suffered severe head injuries in December of 1993 when run over in the barn area at Santa Anita by Tabasco Cat, will be honored Feb. 19 at the annual Casa Colina Tribute to Courage dinner at the Huntington Ritz Carlton Hotel in Pasadena.

All of the offers {to remain in St. Louis or to relocate in Baltimore or Jacksonville} were very good, but Phoenix offered the best opportunity.\"\n\nIf the move is approved by 21 of the NFL's 28 owners, the team will play in 70,000-seat Sun Devil Stadium on the Arizona State University campus in Tempe and will have the option of moving to a proposed $160 million, 74,500-seat domed stadium in downtown Phoenix.\n\nArizona State Vice President Brent Brown said Bidwill had negotiated \"a 10-year lease with some options. Mr. Bidwill has an escape clause that he can take his team and play anywhere he wants to.\"\n\nMaryland Stadium Authority chairman Herb Belgrad said \"knowledgeable people in NFL circles\" have told him that Baltimore's chances for landing an expansion franchise as early as 1990 were enhanced by its effort to land the Cardinals. He yesterday sent Bidwill a congratulatory telegram, also seeking \"your support and assistance in our effort to return NFL football to Baltimore.\"\n\nIn Annapolis, Gov. William Donald Schaefer said that Bidwill had told him from the outset of talks with Maryland officials that he planned to leave St. Louis. Schaefer said he did not feel \"used\" by Bidwill, as he had felt used when Robert Irsay pitted Baltimore bidding against Indianapolis before the Colts owner moved the franchise there in the dark of the night in March 1984.\n\nSchaefer said he thought \"the climate had a lot to do with Bidwill's decision.\" The governor praised the efforts of the stadium authority, saying, \"We couldn't have done anymore.\" Schaefer said his main disappointment was that construction couldn't be started on the football stadium in Camden Yards until Baltimore had a team and construction costs were sure to increase by the time the NFL expands.\n\nThe league owners must approve the move and a vote will be taken no later than the league's annual meeting in March in, ironically, Phoenix. Early indications among the owners were that, because Bidwill followed league protocols unlike the two other owners who have moved franchises this decade, they will support him.\n\n\"It took a lot of effort from a lot of different people,\" said Tempe Mayor Harry Mitchell. \"It obviously wasn't just the money. Other cities matched our offer a long time ago. It was the life style, the quality of life offered here.\"\n\nBurton Barr, a former Arizona House majority leader who represented Phoenix in the negotiations that began last October, displayed a red sweatshirt bearing the white words \"Arizona Cardinals.\"\n\nThe Bidwill family has owned the Cardinals 53 years, including the last 27 seasons in St. Louis. Bill Bidwill and brother Charles, whom he subsequently bought out, moved the team there from Chicago for the 1960 season.\n\n\"If the NFL owners allow Mr. Bidwill to move under these circumstances,\" said St. Louis Mayor Vincent Schoemehl, \"the NFL is putting up an open bidding war for every franchise in this league. Every city in this country will be able to raid every city in this country.\"\n\n\"No one wants to see a franchise move,\" said Cleveland owner Art Modell, one of the NFL's most influential owners. \"But Billy Bidwill has kept the league informed for four years about the problems he's been having in St. Louis. This is no overnight move. It appears it got to the point where he couldn't operate in St. Louis anymore.\"\n\nYesterday was the deadline for notifying the NFL of an intended move for the upcoming season.\n\nWhen the NFL rejected the Oakland Raiders' move to Los Angeles in 1982, owner Al Davis moved anyway, then won an antitrust suit against the league. The other move occurred in 1984 when Irsay moved the Colts without league approval or even informing the league he was doing so.\n\nBidwill's deal in Arizona includes the Phoenix area business community building and leasing 60 sky boxes at Sun Devil Stadium in time for the 1989 season and a $5 million training facility in Phoenix, according to sources in Phoenix.\n\nArizona is reportedly guaranteeing the Cardinals $17 million annually in revenues from gate receipts and concessions. Jim O'Connell, an Arizona State official, estimated that Bidwill could clear $18 million to $21 million annually in stadium revenues with complete sellouts.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with NFL economics, the move would allow the Cardinals to go from below league average revenues to near the top. The Cardinals had gross revenues of $29.6 million in 1986, some $1.7 million below the league average, but made a profit of $4.3 million because Bidwill's player payroll of $15 million was one of the lowest in the NFL.\n\nWith $17 million from network television, he could gross more than $38 million next season. In 1986, the Indianapolis Colts grossed the highest revenues: $39 million.\n\nIn St. Louis, County Executive Gene McNary, who worked hard but unsuccessfully to get a domed stadium constructed, said Bidwill told him yesterday he would do all he could to help St. Louis land an expansion franchise. \"He said that he just couldn't stay in St. Louis because this had become a divided community,\" McNary said.\n\n\"We've had some winners through the years,\" former Cardinals lineman Dan Dierdorf said, \"but we'll be remembered as a town that wouldn't support a football team.\""}, {"url": "https://www.azcardinals.com/team/front-office-roster/quentin-harris", "page_content": "Former Cardinals safety Quentin Harris begins his 16th season in Arizona's scouting department and third as Vice President, Player Personnel after being promoted in February, 2021.

He followed that up by participating in the same program during the 2022 regular season. The program, part of the NFL's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, provides prospects direct networking opportunities and exposure to club owners to help prepare them for future positions.\n\nIn his current role, Harris helps manage both the college and pro personnel departments.\n\nA free safety for four seasons with the Cardinals (2002-05), Harris began his scouting career after finishing his NFL playing career with the Denver Broncos in 2007. He joined the Cardinals in 2008 as a pro scout and was elevated to Assistant Pro Personnel Director in 2010.\n\nHarris was signed by the Cardinals as an undrafted rookie free agent in 2002 out of Syracuse and appeared in 54 games (six starts) over four seasons. He led the Cardinals in special teams tackles for two consecutive seasons (19 in 2004, 24 in 2005) before signing as a free agent with the New York Giants in 2006.

In two weeks, voters in Maricopa County will decide the fate of a proposed $331 million stadium for the team. Cardinals vice president Michael Bidwill said the new stadium was not a reason for Monday's change.\n\n\"It was a non-factor here,\" he said. \"The polls have improved during the same time that we had a decline in performance on the field. It's an unacceptable performance and the decision was based on that. It had nothing to do with the vote coming up, and I think voters are seeing that it's just a football stadium.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTobin was in the middle of his fifth season after replacing Buddy Ryan on Feb. 7, 1996. He posted a 29-44 record with the Cardinals, leading the club to the playoffs in 1998 -- its first postseason appearance since 1982.\n\nSince the 1998 playoff appearance, it has been all downhill for the Cardinals, who have lost 15 of their last 23 games.\n\nTobin arrived in Arizona as one of the best defensive minds in football. He had prior NFL coaching experience as defensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears from 1986-92 and the Indianapolis Colts in 1994-95. As Chicago's defensive coordinator, he coached a unit that set an NFL record for fewest points (187) allowed in a 16-game season.\n\nTobin is the second NFL coach to be replaced this season. On September 25, Bruce Coslet resigned as coach of the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nMcGinnis, 49, was in the fifth season as the Cards' defensive coordinator and has no previous head coaching experience. The team did not reveal if McGinnis' appointment would be on a full-time basis.

I will consult and work closely with Jim and get the approval of Mr. Irsay. He wants my football experience and success.\"\n\nSo will Tobin trade quarterback Jeff George to the Bears for Jim Harbaugh?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"What else are the Bears going to throw in?\" Tobin asked with a laugh.\n\nTobin was never an avid backer of George, first player selected in the 1990 draft, so George's future in Indianapolis is in question. George skipped most of training camp in a dispute he never publicly clarified. He was said to be fed up with what he perceived as unfair criticism in his hometown.\n\nTobin said he was going to review personnel with coach Ted Marchibroda before he talks about anyone, including George.\n\nSince the Colts finished 28th in the league in defense, Tobin's brother Vince could soon rekindle the family reunion they had with the Bears from 1986-92, when the Bears' defense finished 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 25th, 6th, 4th and 17th.\n\n\"We've got some changes to make,\" Bill Tobin admitted when asked about Vince.\n\nThe Colts' defensive coordinator is former Northwestern coach Rick Venturi.\n\nThe Tobin hiring was one of two shakeups in the NFL Friday. The New York Jets fired coach Bruce Coslet and promoted defensive coordinator Pete Carroll after Coslet refused to hire an offensive coordinator. Coslet spent four years without a winning season. After making the playoffs in 1991 as an 8-8 wild card, the Jets suffered through 4-12 and 8-8 seasons.\n\nTobin praised former Bears General Manager Jim Finks as his role model in structuring a team. He compared his situation in Indianapolis to the 1974 hiring of Finks by the Bears, who were a father-son operation. In that case, however, Finks was hired by son Mugs Halas, not father George. Mugs gave up his authority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Irsay will keep his title as vice president and general manager. Tobin said Jim Irsay, assistant GM Bob Terpenning and general counsel Michael Chernoff would remain responsible for signing players and fitting them under the salary cap.\n\nThe Colts had the third-highest payroll in the league last season, according to NFL Players Association figures. At $40.2 million, they are more than $6 million over next year's projected cap of $34 million.\n\n\"I'm here to tell them who to spend the money on,\" Tobin said. \"That's my area of expertise.\"\n\nSince the Colts finished fifth in the AFC East, they will avoid a game against the Bears next season and play a fifth-place schedule instead. The Colts have the second pick in the April 24 draft.

But as a youth, he kept individual statistics on his batting average in baseball, scoring average in basketball and touchdowns in football. Few peers wanted to play with the pre-teen Harbaugh because of his overweening competitiveness and ego. It was at Michigan that Harbaugh learned the meaning of Coach Bo Schembechler's cornerstone phrase: the team, the team, the team.\n\nThat lesson suited him well when he joined the Bears. He played little that first season, made his pro debut as a starter in a Monday night game against the Rams in 1988 and then outdueled Mike Tomczak through last season and in the '90 preseason for the starting job. Settling on Harbaugh in 1990 may not have been as difficult a decision for Ditka as it appeared. Since Harbaugh was a No. 1 pick, since he had been around the offense for three seasons and since his contract expired this year, now was the time to see if this Bear investment for the future was ripe.\n\n\"His maturation is amazing when you consider that early in the season, fans here were ready to throw him out the door,\" said Greg Landry, the Bears' offensive coordinator. \"The most important improvement he's made over last year is becoming totally versed in the offense. Last year, if a play was sent in and it was mistakenly jumbled in sequence, he wouldn't neccessarily know how to unscramble it. Now Jim can straighten out mistakes and call the correct audibles. That has given him a measure of respect among his teammates that's hard to come by.\n\n\"I was a scrambling quarterback, so I know how Jim feels when there's that tendency to get out of that pocket and run. But now he's taking extra looks and making that one last look. And we have adapted the offense more around what we as an offense do well and what Jim does well.\" Off-Season Commitment\n\nHarbaugh realized during the off season that this season was a pivotal year in his pro career. He had always been one of the first to enter and one of the last to leave the Bears' weight room at Halas Hall, but he added martial arts to improve his reaction and quickness, exercises with an eye specialist to increase his visualization (particularly in reading defenses), a chiropracter to increase his back strength, and workouts on a balance beam in his home from where he threw footballs while coordinating his footwork. He watched tapes of every Bears game and each play from last season. He weighed 200 pounds as a college senior, but this season he is a visibly stronger 220 pounds."}]}
