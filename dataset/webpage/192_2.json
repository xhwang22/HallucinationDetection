A few are better known than the star I've chosen to focus on today, though none were nearly as active during such a short span as my pick, Alan Dinehart, was in 1930s and early '40s Hollywood.\n\nMore following the image of Alan Dinehart, born 1889-ish.\n\nIf you put a star by one of my top picks for October, Dante's Inferno (1935), and caught it on TCM earlier this week then you saw Alan Dinehart as Spencer Tracy's right hand man Jonesy. Another recent sighting was in The Whistler (1944) a few weeks back. Dinehart was seen offering advice to J. Carrol Naish in that first film of the Columbia series starring Richard Dix.\n\nAlan Dinehart was very active on Broadway from 1918 onwards and originally arrived in Hollywood as a leading man in 1931. But Dinehart was better suited for character roles and that is how we best remember him today. Dinehart typically played villains, or at the very least his characters were not completely on the level. I like him best for his brash businessmen, though I'd never want to sign a contract with one of his characters!\n\nAlan Dinehart was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, October 3, 1889. Maybe. No doubt about St. Paul, but every time new paperwork was filled out the rest gets called into question. His given first name was definitely Harold with the middle name of either Alan or Allen. In 1936 Alan Dinehart legally changed his name to that of his father, Mason Alan Dinehart, so that his youngest son could legally be known as Alan Dinehart III. I'd imagine that move didn't sit too well with his son by a previous marriage, Alan Dinehart, Jr.\n\nWhile the date on our Alan Dinehart's birth registration is given as October 5, later paper work, including his World War II draft registration card , give the date as October 3. The year Dinehart was born seems generally accepted as 1889, but it should be noted that on both his birth and draft registrations it is given as 1888, and in Dinehart's own hand on the latter. Dinehart's 1944 obituaries claimed he was 48, but Alan seemed flexible about his date of birth, even claiming he was just 40 on the 1930 census ... and he remained 40 on the 1940 census\n\nSome time after his birth Alan's father disappears (dies?) and the young man moved to Montana with his mother, Elizabeth, and stepfather, Louis Brasch. There he attended Butte High School where he had his first taste of acting.\n\nIn 1907 he married a Joe Trickey in Miles City, Montana, though I do not know what happened to this first Mrs. Dinehart. One way or another Alan left her behind when he took the cattle train to New York and embarked upon his acting career. He's said to have appeared in Applesauce in Chicago in 1910 and made his way to Broadway by 1918. In between he married a second time, to actress Marie Louise Dyer, with whom he'd have son Alan Dinehart, Jr. in 1918. It wasn't until after arriving in Hollywood that Dinehart would marry the woman he'd spend the rest of his life with, actress Mozelle Britton, in 1933.\n\nAlong with Alan's name change in 1936 came son Mason Alan Dinehart III, who would claim Irving S. Cobb as his godfather. In early 1939 Mozelle was involved in a terrible car accident, but she recovered and even played alongside Alan in a radio drama shortly before his death. Alan died in 1944; Mozelle in 1953. She was just 41. I'll leave it to you to decide how old Alan Dinehart was, I'll go with the flow and say 54.\n\nOne of Alan Dinehart's greatest triumphs came later in his career, off the screen and on the Broadway stage. His play Separate Rooms, which he wrote, directed and starred in along with Lyle Talbot and Glenda Farrell, was a Broadway hit playing over 600 times during 1940-41. That was after overcoming the lousy reviews which greeted it, no small feat.\n\nOther films you may have seen Alan Dinehart in include Lawyer Man (1932), where he's William Powell's uptown partner; as Cagney's competition in Jimmy the Gent (1934); and as Virginia Bruce's press agent in Born to Dance (1936) starring Eleanor Powell and James Stewart.\n\nYou've surely seen him in a number of other films as well: According to the IMDb, Alan Dinehart managed a total of 89 credited roles during his active Hollywood career from 1931 until his 1944 death. Mid-1930's newspaper reports noted that he typically worked in 15 films per year.\n\nBesides Lawyer Man, other movies featuring Alan Dinehart that I have previously written about on this site as The Payoff (1935) and The World Changes (1933).\n\nAlso\n\n... born on October 3 ... they're each better remembered for other projects, but I have to point to my Werewolf of London (1935) article in mentioning that co-stars Henry Hull and Warner Oland each celebrated their birthday on October 3.\n\nOland, best known for his portrayals of Charlie Chan, was the elder, born iN Sweden, 1879. While Hull, best recalled for Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat (1944), was Kentucky born in 1890.\n\nAlso born on October 3 were legend of the stage Eleanora Duse in 1858; character actor Charles Middleton in 1874; author of so many great stories turned into Depression era films, Damon Runyon, in 1880; director Leo McCarey, of so many favorite comedies, in 1896; and silent starlet Josephine Hill in 1899.\n\nTCM Pick\n\nYou can chop up today's TCM programming into four parts and all of them have something to recommend about them!\n\nThe day begins with five films starring character man James Gleason including the first Hildegarde Withers mystery, Penguin Pool Murder (1932) starring Edna May Oliver at 7:45 am. Next are three films directed by Leo McCarey, mentioned in the birthday section immediately above, beginning with Love Affair (1939) at 2 pm EST.\n\nThe first of TCM's Classic Horror marathons begins at 8 with The Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), the first of four chillers featuring Lionel Atwill. That's followed by Doctor X (1932) at 9:30; Mark of the Vampire (1935) at 11:00 pm; and House of Dracula (1945) at 12:15 am.\n\nThe overnight is populated by zombies with George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968) airing at 2:45 am and the Val Lewton produced I Walked With a Zombie (1943) from Jacques Tourneur following at 4:30 am.\n\nTo pick just one? Well, if you've never seen any of these I'd feel you out some before insisting upon Night of the Living Dead, but since that one falls outside of the general timeline of this website I'd instead suggest Mark of the Vampire (1935), which besides Atwill also features Lionel Barrymore and Bela Lugosi.\n\nSales Notes\n\nI must really love the 1940 A and M Wix Cinema Cavalcade tobacco card sets because I'm constantly using examples from either the first or second volume to illustrate my posts!\n\nI've recently listed some higher grade examples, averaging about EX-MT or 7/10, to eBay in the Fixed Price/Buy it Now format.

He became a character actor and supporting player in at least eighty-eight films between 1931 and 1944. Earlier, he appeared in more than twenty Broadway plays. Dinehart\"s likeness was drawn in caricature by Alex Gard for Sardi\"s, the New York City theater district restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library. Dinehart\"s first wife was the stage actress Louise Dyer (1895-1934), a native of Nassau County, New New York In 1933, Dinehart married the film actress Mozelle Britton (May 12, 1912 - May 18, 1953), a native of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They are entombed together at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Dinehart had two sons: from the first marriage, Alan Dinehart, Junior.

In Street of Women (1932) he essayed an architect who, bored with his society wife, indiscreetly keeps a mistress (Kay Francis) on the side. In Supernatural (1933) he was true to form as the phony spiritualist fleecing a wealthy socialite, played by Carole Lombard; and in Jimmy the Gent (1934) he was an urbane con artist in competition with James Cagney. On rarer occasions Alan found gainful employment as more benevolent characters, point in case his theatrical impressario Theodore von Eltz in Dance, Girl, Dance (1933). All of these performances attracted good reviews from Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times, ranging from \"excellent\" to \"bearing up valiantly\".\n\nIn unlikely contrast to his self-styled image of \"Hollywood's most versatile villain\", Dinehart had strong comedic inclinations, co-authoring several comedy plays towards the later stages of his career. The last and most successful of these, \"Separate Rooms\" (1940-1941), with Dinehart top-billed alongside Glenda Farrell and Lyle Talbot, became one of the longest-running non-musical plays on Broadway at the time, finally closing after 613 performances.

On screen, he appeared mostly in \u201cB\u201d pictures, notable exceptions being the MGM musical blockbuster Born to Dance (1936) and the classic 20th Century-Fox family drama Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1938) . Dinehart specialized in portraying swaggering or devious businessmen, crooked politicians or racketeers.

In Supernatural (1933), he was true to train the bogus spiritualist swindling a wealthy socialite, played by Carole Lombard; and in Jimmy the Gent (1934) he was an urban trickster competing with James Cagney. On rarer occasions, Alan found gainful employment as more benevolent characters, in case his theatrical impresario Theodore von Eltz in Dance, Girl, Dance (1933). All of these performances drew good reviews from The New York Times\u2019 Mordaunt Hall, ranging from \u201cexcellent\u201d to \u201cendure valiantly\u201d.\n\nAlan Dinehart Trivia\n\nFather of actor Alan Dinehart, father of Mason Alan Dinehart.\n\nAccording to the San Bernardino Sun of July 18, 1944, Dinehart died of complications from double pneumonia.\n\nHis voice sounded like William Holden\u2019s.\n\nHollywood supporting player in many films until the mid-1940s.\n\nPerformed on Broadway from 1918 to 1941."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/mason-alan-dinehart", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nMason Alan Dinehart (Mason Alan Dinehart III) was born on 30 April, 1936 in Hollywood, California, USA, is an Actor.
