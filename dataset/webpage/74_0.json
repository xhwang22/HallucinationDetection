Abdul Kalam won many awards, both from the Indian government and from the international community. His most notable awards were the Padma Vibhushan, won in 1990, and the Bharat Ratna, won in 1997, for his contributions to science and engineering and service to the government.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to develop India\u2019s economy through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase the availability of health care and education. In recognition of Kalam\u2019s services to the country and broad popularity, the National Democratic Alliance nominated him for president in 2002.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam attended the Madras Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in aeronautical engineering in 1960. After graduation he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)\u2014an Indian military research institute\u2014and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam\u2019s associations were not limited to research organizations: he was also associated with political groups, such as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam served as president of the Republic of India from 2002 to 2007. As president, Kalam promoted the advancement of the national nuclear weapons program. Kalam also devised a 20-year action plan to achieve economic growth through technological development in India.\n\nA.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India\u2014died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India\u2019s missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.\n\nKalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname \u201cMissile Man.\u201d Among those successes was Agni, India\u2019s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.\n\nBritannica Quiz Explore India Quiz\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999\u20132001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country\u2019s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.\n\nIn 2002 India\u2019s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India\u2019s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country\u2019s first woman president.\n\nUpon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. On July 27, 2015, he collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.\n\nKalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999).

For his immense contribution in the development of India, Dr Kalam received numerous awards during the course of his career including the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian honor in India. Know more about the contributions of A. P. J. Abdul Kalam through his 10 major achievements.\n\n#1 HE HELPED BUILD INDIA\u2019S FIRST INDIGENOUS HOVERCRAFT\n\nAbdul Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO), right after graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960. As a young scientist, he was assigned his first project to design and develop a hovercraft for the country\u2019s defence applications. A hovercraft is an amphibious craft capable of travelling over land, water, mud, ice and other surfaces. After days of hard-work, Kalam and his team were successful in developing India\u2019s first indigenous hovercraft which was named Nandi, the impressive white bull who acts as the vehicle of the Hindu deity Lord Shiva. Project Nandi received massive applause from the then Defense Minister, V.K Krishna Menon, and encouraged Kalam for his future endeavours. However, Project Nandi was shelved as the new government in power didn\u2019t show any interest in the invention.\n\nIndia\u2019s first Hovercraft NANDI\n\n#2 HE WAS PART OF THE TEAM WHICH SET UP TERLS\n\nThough Project Nandi was put in cold storage, due to it Kalam got a call from the Indian Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR) to attend an interview at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). At the time, INCOSPAR was formed out of the TIFR talent pool. Among the members of the selection panel who interviewed Kalam was Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, the father of the Indian Space Programme and the founder of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Dr. Sarabhai took a deep interest in Kalam and selected him as a rocket engineer in INCOSPAR. The team of rocket engineers of which Kalam was a part, set up the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1963. TERLS is used by ISRO to launch sounding rockets even today.\n\nYoung Abdul Kalam (left) with Dr. Vikram Sarabhai\n\n#3 KALAM WAS THE PROJECT DIRECTOR OF INDIA\u2019S FIRST SLV\n\nIn 1969, when INCOSPAR led to the birth of the ISRO, Kalam was transferred there and was initially involved in research about building rockets. In the early 1970s, ISRO introduced its own Satellite Launch Vehicle program owing to geopolitical and economic considerations. It was a program to develop the technology needed to launch satellites. Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was made the project director of the program. Beginning with mechanical designing to electrical integration, Kalam single-handedly supervised every aspect of the project, which was a massive success. On July 18, 1980, Satellite Launch Vehicle-3 (SLV-3) was successfully launched from Sriharikota range in the Nellore district of Andhra Pradesh. It deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit. It was the first successful satellite launch that took place on Indian soil and thereby made India the seventh member of an exclusive club of space-faring nations in international society.\n\n#4 HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF AGNI AND PRITHVI MISSILES\n\nAfter the huge triumph of SLV-III and dedicating the paramount years of his life to ISRO, Dr. Kalam was issued transfer orders to DRDO, where he was given the responsibility to lead the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). According to the instructions of then Defence Minister R. Venkataraman, four missiles were to be developed simultaneously as part of the program. After years of consistent hard work and immense dedication, India got her first range of ballistic missiles, the Prithvi, the Agni, the Aakash, and the Nag. Out of the four, two missiles, namely, Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile; and Agni, an intermediate-range ballistic missile; were launched successfully. Due to this mammoth achievement under his leadership, India became a major military power and Dr Kalam became popularly known as the \u201cMissile Man of India\u201d.\n\nAgni-I during a test flight on July 13, 2012\n\n#5 HE SUPERVISED THE POKHRAN-II EXPLOSIONS AS THE CHIEF OF DRDO\n\nDr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period and Kalam played an intensive political and technological role in their success. Along with Dr. R. Chidambaram, the Director of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), he served as the chief coordinator in the planning of the tests. The Pokhran-II tests, a series of five nuclear bomb test explosions, were conducted at the Indian Army\u2019s Pokhran Test Range in May 1998. The tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability to build fission and thermonuclear weapons with yields up to 200 Kilotons. Exclusive media coverage during the event, made Kalam a household name in India and he became the best known nuclear scientist in the nation.\n\nThermonuclear device Shakti I tested during Pokhran-II\n\n#6 HE SERVED AS THE FIRST PRINCIPAL SCIENTIFIC ADVISOR TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA\n\nAfter his retirement from DRDO, Kalam was appointed as the first-ever Principal Scientific Advisor (PSA) to the Government Of India from November 1999 to November 2001. Principal Scientific Advisor was a Cabinet rank position at the time and was largely created to assist scientific cross-sectoral synergy across ministries, institutions and the industry. During his service period, Dr. Kalam supervised committees making master plans regarding defence, agriculture, healthcare and information technology. Under this esteemed post, he was also responsible for evolving policies, strategies and missions for many developmental applications.\n\nAbdul Kalam receiving Bharat Ratna from President K. R.

Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period, and have been associated with Kalam although he was not directly involved with the nuclear programme at the time. Honours\n\nOn April 29, 2009, he became the first Asian to be bestowed the Hoover Medal, America\u2019s top engineering prize, for his outstanding contribution to public service. The citation said that he is being recognised for making state-of-the-art healthcare available to the common man at affordable prices, bringing quality medical care to rural areas by establishing a link between doctors and technocrats, using spin-offs of defence technology to create state-of-the-art medical equipment and launching tele-medicine projects connecting remote rural-based hospitals to the super-specialty hospital. A pre-eminent scientist, a gifted engineer, and a true visionary, he is also a humble humanitarian in every sense of the word, it added.[12] On 13 September 2009, he was a recipient of the International von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n Wings Award.[13]\n\nThe Government of India has honoured him with the nation\u2019s highest civilian honours: the Padma Bhushan in 1981; Padma Vibhushan in 1990; and the Bharat Ratna in 1997 for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor to the Indian government. Kalam is the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna before being elected to the highest office, the other two being Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Zakir Hussain. He is also the first scientist and first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhavan. After his tenure as the president he is now a visiting guest professor at JSS University, Mysore.

Abdul Kalam was a space scientist. He was a key driver of India\u2019s space and missile programs. After he retired, Kalam tried to bridge the gap between rocket science and politics. A popular president (2002-2007), he accepted the proposal to run for a second term. He laid down one condition, however; the choice had to be unanimous. Some political parties didn\u2019t agree. Politics (and politicians) did not win; the country lost. A popular president had to go after only one term.\n\nIn the U.S., the president has executive powers. In India, though every bill is sent to the president for his approval before its conversion into an act, he merely has a red-flag role. If parliament sends the same bill to him again, he has no recourse but to sign off on it.\n\nIndians tend to see Kalam as a father figure, but not as one in authority. He was not just a father figure. An outsider in politics and free of political affiliations, he redefined and demystified Indian presidency. From India\u2019s Missile Man, he became the People\u2019s President.\n\n\u201cHe pushed the country to reach new heights and to aspire to lead the way in its global rise, rather than aim to merely catch-up with the developed nations.\u201d\u2013Saikat Chaudhuri\n\nIn a 2008 interview with Knowledge at Wharton, Kalam explained his view of leadership. He emphasized that leaders should have a vision and not be afraid to go down unfamiliar paths. Most importantly, Kalam said, they should know how to manage failure (see video).\n\nA teacher till the very end, on July 27, Kalam, 83, collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. Below, some Wharton professors and Indian business leaders explain what they admired about the late president:\n\n\u201cPresident Kalam was an inspiration to all of us,\u201d says Jagmohan Raju, Wharton professor of marketing and vice dean of Wharton Executive Education. \u201cA man of science, equally adept at designing ballistic missiles and coronary stents, nuclear devices and tablet computers, writing computer code or poetry. When it came to leadership, [he] relied more on faith, humility and integrity. We all fondly recall his visit to Wharton where he charmed one and all equally with his wit and wisdom. [He was] a teacher who cared about students and young Indians all his life up to the very end. All of us who teach at Wharton, and all over the world, salute you Dr. Kalam. You will continue to inspire us all.\u201d\n\nSaikat Chaudhuri,Wharton adjunct professor of management and executive director of Wharton\u2019s Mack Institute for Innovation Management, says he is deeply saddened by Kalam\u2019s death not only because he was a \u201cfine human being with multiple talents,\u201d but because \u201chis departure is a huge loss\u201d for India. \u201cThe country needs many more inspiring visionaries like him to realize [its] full potential on the world stage,\u201d says Chaudhuri. \u201cDr. Kalam was a \u2018People\u2019s President,\u2019 and ignited those he met with a passion not only to contribute to India\u2019s growth, but to aim for world-class standards in their pursuits and be the best on a global platform. He was a true nationalist, who was motivated purely by a desire to contribute to a better India and world, upholding the utmost integrity. For India to reach her potential as an economic, political, and sociocultural superpower, we need many more leaders to follow in the footsteps of Dr. Kalam. He pushed the country to reach new heights and to aspire to lead the way in its global rise, rather than aim to merely catch up with the developed nations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy showing that it was possible to think big and look far, he did what the best leaders always do: recalibrate what people think is possible.\u201d\u2013Manish Sabharwal\n\nJitendra V. Singh, dean and professor of business at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and emeritus professor of management at Wharton recalls: \u201cI was privileged to meet President Abdul Kalam not once, but several times\u2026. In the time I spent with him, I was struck most of all by his simplicity, and almost childlike curiosity. He was extremely alert, and a great conversationalist. As I sat near him through the ceremony [when Kalam was awarded an honorary doctorate at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore], I remember thinking to myself, \u201cWhat a remarkable life story; what a remarkable Indian.\u201d We have lost a remarkable Indian. While born a Muslim, he truly embraced the spirit of being Indian, quoting, as he would from time to time, from Hindu scriptures. He will be missed, but his ideas will live on, even as India takes its rightful place in the world. This is the India he dreamed about.\u201d\n\nManish Sabharwal, co-founder and chairman of TeamLease Services, India\u2019s leading staffing company, believes that Kalam did for Indian science and politics what the IT industry did for Indian business. \u201cHe raised aspirations by catalyzing a demonstration effect. By showing that it was possible to think big and look far, he did what the best leaders always do: recalibrate what people think is possible. He was also one of the first in public life to reaffirm that you don\u2019t have to be Western to be modern, but that India must work hard to come up with our [own] definition of modernity, which must include science, technology, innovation and equality of opportunity for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was a President of India who commanded respect for the human being that he was, and not because of his title.\u201d\u2013Rajat Kumar\n\nAllwin Agnel, founder of education network PaGaLGuY, says Kalam taught leadership to people the way it always should be done: humbly. \u201cBy humbly, leading. To touch lives by doing what is right, by never saying no to any good deed and by simply stepping up and being more. In a world of alpha leaders, he was the servant leader. A million people followed him because his words and actions always reflected his passion and willingness to help the world be a better place.\u201d\n\nRajat Kumar, vice president of SnapDeal, says: \u201cMy grandparents used to tell me stories about Dr. Rajendra Prasad (India\u2019s first president) and Lal Bahadur Shastri (India\u2019s second prime minister), and the faith they inspired. I was looking for that inspiration from our [current] leaders, but was not really sure whether I would ever find it \u2014 until Dr. Kalam became our president. He was a great scientist, an epitome of hard work, but most importantly, a human being who was untarnished by the trappings of power. My fondest memory of him is of a speech when he was addressing some children. When a child asked something, he sat on the steps to hear what the question was, and answered it sitting right there \u2014 on the steps of the stage with the child. This was a President of India who commanded respect for the human being that he was, and not because of his title.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.thehindu.com/specials/in-depth/A.P.J.-Abdul-Kalam-1931-2015/article60333923.ece", "page_content": "July 27, 2015 10:57 pm | Updated November 17, 2021 10:44 am IST\n\nA.P.J.

Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to develop India\u2019s economy through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase the availability of health care and education. In recognition of Kalam\u2019s services to the country and broad popularity, the National Democratic Alliance nominated him for president in 2002.\n\nA.P.J.

He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.\n\nKalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname \u201cMissile Man.\u201d Among those successes was Agni, India\u2019s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.\n\nBritannica Quiz Explore India Quiz\n\nFrom 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999\u20132001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country\u2019s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years.

In Sanskrit too we have a similar word called 'Raja Rishi which means a Raja or King needs to live a life of a Rishi or Sage. And King Janaka (father of Sita Devi) was believed to be a Raja Rishi who led a saintly life in the palace. A Raja Rishi lives with a detachment to the materialist world / worldly pleasures. We hardly find such Raja Rishis or Philosopher Kings in the modern era. But Dr.Abdul Kalam stood an example of such a ruler who was a Philosopher King / Raja Rishi with quantum of knowledge.\n\n\n\nHis life history is a great source of inspiration not only to the present generation but to all alike irrespective of the age group. There is much to learn from his life. He gave much importance to knowledge than to wealth and he truly lead a life of Karma Yogi\n\n\n\nFew of his famous quotes If a country is to be corruption free and become a nation of beautiful minds, I strongly feel there are three key societal members who can make a difference. They are the father, the mother and the teacher.\n\nEnglish is necessary as at present original works of science are in English. I believe that in two decades times original works of science will start coming out in our languages. Then we can move over like the Japanese.\n\nYou have to dream before your dreams can come true.\n\nGreat dreams of great dreamers are always transcended.\n\nTo succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal.\n\nMan needs his difficulties because they are necessary to enjoy success.\n\nWe should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.\n\nThose who cannot work with their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success that breeds bitterness all around.\n\nIn India we only read about death, sickness, terrorism, crime. Conclusion Dr.Abdul Kalam is one of the most popular Presidents of the country who rose to the heights from the son of a boat-maker in a small coastal town to the First Citizen of the country. His incredible journey of life is a great inspiration to many particularly to the youth.\n\n\n\nOn July 27' 2015, Dr. Kalam suffered a massive cardiac arrest and collapsed on the stage while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in Shillong. He was immediately shifted to Bethany Hospital where he breathed his last. He was 84 years old."}, {"url": "https://www.4to40.com/biographies-for-kids/a-p-j-abdul-kalam/", "page_content": "A. P. J. Abdul Kalam \u2014 Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (born 15 October 1931 \u2013 died 27 July 2015) is an Indian scientist and administrator who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, studied physics at the St. Joseph\u2019s College, Tiruchirappalli, and aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology, Chennai.\n\nBefore his term as President, he worked as an Aerospace engineer with Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam is popularly known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He played a pivotal organisational, technical and political role in India\u2019s Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.\n\nKalam was elected the President of India in 2002, defeating Lakshmi Sahgal, was nominated by Bharatiya Janata Party and supported by opposition Indian National Congress, the major political parties of India. He is currently a visiting professor at Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and Indian Institute of Management Indore, honorary fellow of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology Thiruvananthapuram, a professor of Aerospace Engineering at Anna University (Chennai), JSS University (Mysuru) and an adjunct/visiting faculty at many other academic and research institutions across India.\n\nKalam advocated plans to develop India into a developed nation by 2020 in his book India 2020. He has received several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India\u2019s highest civilian honour. Kalam is known for his motivational speeches and interaction with the student community in India. He launched his mission for the youth of the nation in 2011 called the What Can I Give Movement with a central theme to defeat corruption in India.\n\nEarly Life and Education:\n\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 in a Tamil Muslim family to Jainulabudeen, a boat owner and Ashiamma, a housewife, at Rameswaram, Ramanathapuram District, located in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. He came from a poor background and started working at an early age to supplement his family\u2019s income. After completing school, Kalam distributed newspapers to financially contribute to his father\u2019s income. In his school years, he had average grades, but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn and spend hours on his studies, especially mathematics. He was just a simple man with a great fierceful heart in his childhood. After completing his school education at the Ramanathapuram Schwartz Matriculation School, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph\u2019s College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954. Towards the end of the course, he was not enthusiastic about the subject and would later regret the four years he studied it. He then moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering. While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with the lack of progress and threatened revoking his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. He worked tirelessly on his project and met the deadline, impressing the Dean who later said, \u201cI [Dean] was putting you [Kalam] under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline\u201d. He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.\n\nA. P. J. Abdul Kalam: Career as a scientist\n\nAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India\u2019s first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government\u2019s approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.\n\nIn 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.\n\nKalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country\u2019s first nuclear test Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam\u2019s directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace projects.His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating \u20b9 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticized for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.\n\nA. P. J. Abdul Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country\u2019s best known nuclear scientist.\n\nIn 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the \u201cKalam-Raju Stent\u201d. In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the \u201cKalam-Raju Tablet\u201d.\n\nPresidency:\n\nKalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007. During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People\u2019s President.\n\nDeath:\n\nOn 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \u201cCreating a Livable Planet Earth\u201d at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m IST."}, {"url": "https://www.careerindia.com/news/2013/10/15/dr-a-p-j-abdul-kalam-s-life-as-a-president-007015.html", "page_content": "Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K.

He served from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.\n\nOn 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed to the leader of opposition, Indian National Congress president Sonia Gandhi that they would propose Kalam for the post of President. The Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.\n\nAfter the Samajwadi Party announced its support for him, President K. R. Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office. Hence, left the field clear for Kalam to become the 11th President of India."}]}
