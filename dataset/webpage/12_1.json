The Band\u2019s pioneering blend of traditional country, folk, old-time string band, blues, and rock music brought them critical acclaim in the late 1960s and \u201970s and served as a template for Americana, the movement of hybrid, roots-oriented music that emerged in the late 1990s. The members were Jaime (\u201cRobbie\u201d) Robertson (b. July 5, 1944, Toronto, Ontario, Canada), Levon Helm (b. May 26, 1940, Elaine, Arkansas, U.S.\u2014d. April 19, 2012, New York, New York), Rick Danko (b. December 29, 1942, Simcoe, Ontario, Canada\u2014d. December 10, 1999, Marbletown, New York, U.S.), Richard Manuel (b. April 3, 1945, Stratford, Ontario, Canada\u2014d. March 4, 1986, Winter Park, Florida, U.S.), and Garth Hudson (b. August 2, 1937, London, Ontario, Canada).\n\nRobertson, Helm, Danko, Manuel, and Hudson were five self-effacing sidemen pushed into becoming a self-contained group by Dylan, the star in whose shadow they grew. Robertson was the group\u2019s principal writer and guitarist. Drummer Helm was a \u201cgood old boy\u201d from Arkansas, the sole American in a lineup of displaced Canadians. Danko was the amiable hayseed on bass and occasional fiddle. Pianist Manuel sang blues ballads in a wrenching Ray Charles baritone. And Hudson\u2019s otherworldly keyboard doodles were the glue that held the whole operation together. At their peak, from 1968 to 1973, the quintet embodied better than any other group the sense of the American past that came to haunt pop culture after the hippie ideals of the 1960s had crashed to the ground.\n\nThe real midwife to the Band\u2019s birth was Hawkins, a rockabilly diehard from Arkansas who ventured up to Canada in the spring of 1958. As Hawkins\u2019s lieutenant, Helm, still a teenager, helped recruit the young Ontarians\u2014Robertson, Danko, Manuel, and Hudson\u2014who replaced the original members of Hawkins\u2019s backing band, the Hawks. At a point when Fabian ruled the pop airwaves, the razorback rock and roll of the new Hawks was welcome only in the scuzziest roadhouses. During these years on the road, Robertson absorbed much of the flavour of life below the Mason and Dixon Line that would permeate Band songs like \u201cThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\u201d (1969).\n\nIn 1964 the Hawks figured they could make it without Hawkins. During their summer residency on the New Jersey seaboard, Dylan got wind of their reputation and, after playing with Robertson, hired the group to back him on his first electric tour\u2014a tour so controversial among folk purists that Helm could not take the pressure and quit. For the Hawks it was a baptism by fire, and it all but burned them out.\n\nIn 1967, in an effort to recuperate, the group (minus Helm) followed Dylan to Woodstock, New York. In nearby West Saugerties they gathered daily in the basement of \u201cBig Pink,\u201d a secluded ranch house. Here the five men put together a rambling repertoire of old country, folk, and blues songs that later leaked out as a series of \u201cbasement tape\u201d bootlegs and then as the double album The Basement Tapes (1975).\n\nWhen Helm returned to the fold, Dylan began urging \u201cthe Band\u201d\u2014as they were now known locally\u2014to go it alone. The immediate result of this separation was Music from Big Pink (1968), a wholly original fusion of country, gospel, rock, and rhythm and blues that, more than any other album of the period, signaled rock\u2019s retreat from psychedelic excess and blues bombast into something more soulful, rural, and reflective. Yet it was The Band (1969) that really defined the group\u2019s grainy character. Recorded in a makeshift studio in Los Angeles in early 1969, the album was a timeless distillation of American experience from the Civil War to the 1960s.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

After a disastrous debut at Winterland in San Francisco, they played to the massed tribes of the 1969 Woodstock festival. \u201cWe felt like a bunch of preacher boys looking into purgatory,\u201d recalled Robertson. This sense of alienation from the spirit of rock was reflected in Stage Fright (1970), an album full of foreboding and depression. Ironically, the record preceded the Band\u2019s most intensive period of touring, during which they became the formidable live unit of the magnificent Rock of Ages (1972).\n\nThe Band\u2019s experience on the road seemed to affect their confidence\u2014particularly that of Robertson in his role as chief songwriter. Whereas The Band had sounded fresh and intuitive, Cahoots (1971) was laboured and didactic. After a mostly lost year in 1972, when Manuel\u2019s alcoholism became chronic, they trod water with Moondog Matinee (1973), an album of fine cover versions, then hitched their wagon once again to Dylan for the highly successful tour that produced Before the Flood (1974).\n\nJust as they had followed Dylan to Woodstock, so the Band now decamped to southern California. The move suited Robertson, who acclimated quickly to the Hollywood lifestyle, but the others felt like fish out of water. Northern Lights\u2014Southern Cross (1975) at least proved that the Band had not lost its keen musical empathy, but, when Robertson suggested dissolving the group after a final show at Winterland, he encountered little resistance.\n\nStaged on Thanksgiving Day (November 25), 1976, this \u201cBand and friends\u201d finale was immortalized by Martin Scorsese\u2019s film The Last Waltz (1978), with guest appearances by Dylan, Neil Young, and others. With only the lacklustre Islands (1977) as a last, contract-honouring memento of their career, the Band quickly fragmented. In 1983, sans Robertson, the group re-formed and played a less-than-spectacular tour. Three years later, Manuel was found hanging from a shower curtain in a Florida motel room.\n\nHelm, Hudson, and Danko, who moved back to Woodstock, continued to operate as the Band and released three indifferent albums in the 1990s. Robertson remained in Los Angeles, where he made several solo albums and created film soundtracks. The Band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1614420", "page_content": "Infobox musical artist\n\nName = Winnebago Deal\n\n\n\n\n\nImg_capt =\n\nImg_size =\n\nLandscape =\n\nBackground = group_or_band\n\nAlias =\n\nOrigin = England\n\nGenre = Rock\n\nYears_active = 1999\u2013present\n\nLabel = Fierce Panda Records , Double Dragon Music\n\nAssociated_acts =\n\nURL = [ http://www.winnebagodeal.com/ www.winnebagodeal.com ]\n\nCurrent_members = Ben Perrier\n\nBen Thomas\n\nPast_members =\n\nNotable_instruments =\n\nWinnebago Deal is a rock music band from Oxford , United Kingdom .
