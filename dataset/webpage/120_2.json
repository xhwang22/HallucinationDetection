E. Afigbo, Obi Ikenga: The Case for a Pan-Igbo Centre for Igbo Studies(Uturu, Nigeria: Abia State University, 2000).\n\nThe Ahiajoku Lecture Series, which was inaugurated on November 30, 1979, was designed to offer the Igbo a rare opportunity to annually gather and harness the intellectual richness of the people through public lectures by the most erudite of Igbo scholars. It is an annual intellectual harvest in which a distinguished Igbo scholar is selected to educate and share an important aspect of Igbo life and culture related to the lecturer\u2019s expertise. Thus, Ahiajoku lecturers have focused on Igbo political, economic, cultural, social, technological, philosophical and historical experiences, as well as the people\u2019s interactions and encounters with non-Igbo ethnic groups in Nigeria, and with the Europeans. It is an occasion to celebrate the collective Igbo achievements.\n\nFor more information on this Directorate, see Arthur A.

It is expected of an effective teacher or professor to strive to accommodate his or her students\u2019 individual differences and needs. But Afigbo was not for the mediocre or even average students. You must be above average and hardworking in order to survive Afigbo\u2019s scrutiny. The author started her doctoral thesis with Professor Afigbo, but did not complete the work with him due to no fault of theirs. Afigbo and the author worked very hard to complete the thesis, but it was not possible due to his retirement from the university in 1992.\n\nSee, for instance, E. Isichei, A History of the Igbo People(London: Macmillan, 1976), xiv. Here, she thanked Afigbo for the material he lent her and for giving her \u201cthe most unstinted and generous encouragement in a field of study which he has done so much to transform.\u201d\n\nBooks published by Adiele Afigbo, The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria, 1885\u20131950(Rochester, NY: University of Rochester Press, 2006); The Igbo and their Neighbours: Inter-Group Relations in Southeastern Nigeria to 1953(Ibadan, Nigeria: University Press Limited, 1987); with S.

This prejudicial characterization of the region and the period suggests a lawless and unstable atmosphere incapable of fostering any meaningful commercial and intergroup exchanges. Yet, historical accounts have shown that the Aro, Awka, Abiriba, Nkwerre, Aboh, Nike, Nri, Igala, Ijo, Bonny, Nembe, Brass and the Efik triumphed in their business careers before the 1900.\n\nFor the practice of Igbandu, see Felicia Ekejiuba, \u201cIgba Ndu: An Igbo Mechanism of Social Control and Adjustment,\u201d African Notes8, no. 1 (1972): 9\u201324.\n\nSee Richard Henderson, The King in Every Man: Evolutionary Trends in Onitsha Ibo Society and Culture(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1972); Austin Shelton, The Igbo-Igala Borderland: Religion and Social Control in Indigenous African Colonialism(Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1971); and John Boston, \u201cNotes on Contact between the Igala and the Ibo,\u201d Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria2, no. 1 (1960): 52\u201358 on the impact of Igala culture on Nsukka Igbo; Basden, Niger Ibos on the Ijo and the conquest of southern Igbo; Mervin D.

It treats the internal slave trade and the war against it in this region and period as themes separate from the institution of slavery in the same area and the campaign to root it out generally known as emancipation.For this reason, and because slavery and the effort at emancipation have received more attention from scholars, this work concentrates entirely on that aspect of the slave trade and its fortunes under British colonial rule commonly known as abolition. In reconstructing the story of this important and protracted campaign, Adiele Afigbo sheds light on a dark corner of social history that has largely been neglected by historians. Adiele Afigbo is professor in the Department of History and International Relations at Ebonyi State University, Nigeria."}, {"url": "https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/oxford-university-press/igbo-history-and-society-the-essays-of-adiele-afigbo-edited-by-toyin-Sw1hanDOYF", "page_content": "System error.

Even though Afigbo sounds a note of caution that Ajayi\u2019s book came out only three years (1965) after the release of Dike\u2019s pamphlet (1962), there is no doubt that Dike\u2019s work inspired others. While the pamphlet in question was a paper Dike read at the Centenary of the Mission at Christ Church, Onitsha, on November 13, 1957, Ajayi\u2019s book is a revised version of his PhD thesis presented to London University in 1958. But the book was published under the Ibadan History Series, when Dike was the general editor and therefore must have benefited from Dike\u2019s expertise. See F.

Afigbo noted that Nuskka people and their Northern Igala and Idoma neighbors had traded with each other for many centuries before the genesis of the Aro trade network. For the pre-Aro trade in Ngwa area see Oriji (1982), 523\u201348, and (1983), 311\u201328, and for Igboland, see Ukwu (1967), 647\u201362. It is noteworthy that during the Aro trade network, many Igbo people versed in long-distance trade sold their slaves directly to the riverain traders on the Lower Imo and Niger Rivers. For example, Jaja of Opobo was sold to an Akwete trader by an Amaigbo man who had kidnapped him, before the former resold him to a Bonny middleman. Many Ngwa, Asa, Ndoki, Owerri, and other communities located near the riverain towns also traded directly with coastal middlemen.\n\nSimon Ottenberg, Farmers and Townspeople in a Changing Nigeria: Abakaliki during Colonial Times (1905\u20131960) (Ibadan: Spectrum Books, 2005), 27.\n\nJames Roark, Michael Johnson et al., The American Promise: A History of the United States Vol.1: to1877 (Boston: Bedford Books, 1998), 102\u2013108.\n\nPhilip Curtin, The Tropical Atlantic in the Age of the Slave Trade (Washington D.C.: American Historical Association, 1991), 30.\n\nDavid Eltis and David Richardson, \u201cWest Africa and the Transatlantic Slave Trade: New Evidence of Long-Run Trends\u201d in David Eltis and David Richardson (eds.), Routes to Slavery: Direction, Ethnicity and Mortality (London: Frank Cass, 1997), 21.\n\nDouglas Chambers, \u201cMy Own Nation: Igbo Exiles in Diaspora,\u201d in Eltis and Richardson, op. cit., 75. For a statistical study of the Virginian slave exports from Africa see Walter Michinton, Celia King and Peter Waite, Virginia Slave-Trade Statistics 1698\u20131775 (Richmond: Virginia State Library, 1984). The problem of determining slaves of Igbo origin is difficult to resolve since European slave traders generically applied the concept \u201cIgbo\u201d to slaves they exported from the Bight of Biafra, even though the slaves might belong to the Ijo, Ibibio, Igala, and other ethnic nationalities. As an illustration, during the nineteenth century, those who were labeled Igbo slaves, constituting about 5 percent\u201325 percent of the total slave exports, were Nupe, Kankanda, and Hausa peoples. David Eltis and David Richardson, \u201cThe Numbers Game and Routes to Slavery,\u201d in Eltis and Richardson op. cit., 11, have rightly noted that the \u201cconcept of ethnicity [during the slave trade], was more pliable than has sometimes been assumed.\u201d Scholars therefore disagree on their estimates of Igbo slave exports. For example, Inikori, Lovejoy, and Chambers have given different estimates of the total number of Igbo slaves exported during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade\u201433.30 percent, 60 percent, and 80 percent respectively.\n\nSee Joseph Inikori, \u201cThe Sources of Supply for the Atlantic Slave Exports from the Bight of Benin and the Bight of Bonny (Biafra),\u201d Sierge Daget (ed.), De la Traite a l\u2019Esclavage: Acts du Colloque International sur la Traite des Noirs, 3 vols.

Earlier estimates by Philip Curtin, who introduced in 1969 the quantitative method in studying the slave trade, have been revised by many scholars.\n\nFor Curtin\u2019s work see Philip Curtin, The Atlantic Slave Trade: A Census (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1969).\n\nFor some of the revisions of his estimates see David Eltis and David Richardson, \u201cThe Numbers Game and Slavery\u201d in Eltis and Richardson (1997), 1\u201315,\n\nPaul Lovejoy, \u201cThe Volume of the Atlantic Slave Trade: A Synthesis,\u201d Journal of African History, 23 (1982), 478\u201381\n\nand Joseph Inikori, \u201cMeasuring the Atlantic Slave Trade: A Rejoinder,\u201d Journal of African History, XVII.4 (1976), 607\u201327.\n\nSome historians, like M.A. Gomez, Exchanging our Country Marks: The Transformation of African Identities in the Colonial and Antebellum South (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1998), 100\u201308, are critical of the quantitative method, arguing that it desensitizes the monumental moral and psychological issues raised by the slave trade. They have called for a return to the biographical studies of slaves that portray their historical experiences, such as those of O. Equiano, Fredrick Douglass and others.\n\nSee Chapter 4, and Victor Uchendu, \u201cSlaves and Slavery in Igboland,\u201d in S. Miers and I. Kopytoff (eds.), Slavery in Africa: Historical and Anthropological Perspectives (Madison: Wisconsin University Press, 1977), 121\u201332.
