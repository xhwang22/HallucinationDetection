And he said to me right before the elevator doors opened: 'Are you gonna make anything of yourself while you are here?' Before I could say anything, the doors opened and he was gone.\"\n\nHolland didn't take the comment personally. But it certainly motivated him.\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to be the best I could,\" said Holland.\n\nNo doubt, Holland maxed out his ability during a strong career at Purdue.\n\nHe arrived on campus with a fat scrapbook after an uber successful career at Indianapolis power Bishop Chatard High, where he rushed for 2,048 yards on 239 carries (8.6 average) and 35 touchdowns during his senior season. Holland set the Chatard record for career rushing yards (5,270).\n\nThe 6-1, 229-pound Holland transitioned from offense to defense and went on to a strong career in West Lafayette, totaling 324 career tackles and starting 48 games with the Boilermakers from 2008-2011 after redshirting in 2007. He was a co-captain his senior season, a four-year starter and a two-time Academic All-American.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Holland made a lot of himself at Purdue.\n\n\n\nHolland enjoyed a cup-of-coffee NFL career, toiling on several practice squads before enrolling in dental school.\n\nGoldandBlack.com caught up with the 31-year-old Holland this week.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: What was your inspiration to become a dentist?\n\nHolland: I went to Purdue with the plan to be some sort of doctor, just didn't know what field. The beauty of being on the football team was you were exposed to a roomful of doctors and athletic trainers. So, I had a board of people I could bounce ideas off of in terms of what made a lot of sense career-wise. So, I spoke with a couple of the doctors at Purdue and opted for dental school. Everyone said you can't really go wrong. And I did. I always did have a little bit of an interest in dentistry. And as I got a little bit further along in my college career, I kind of shifted my focus towards that. And thankfully I was accepted into dental school my senior year. And IU allowed me to defer enrollment as I gave the NFL a shot and got thrown onto practice squads. I then was able to go into dental school just one year after my last season in the NFL.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How long have you been practicing?\n\nHolland: I just finished my second year of private practice (Holland Dental). I purchased the practice January 3rd this year. I had been an associate at a practice in Fishers for a while and that was all going great, and I really loved the doctor I was working with. But part of what drew me to dentistry in the first place was the ability to own your own practice. Since I had graduated from dental school, I began putting out feelers about who was looking to sell. And I was connected with the doctor that I've just purchased the practice from. He was the team dentist for the Colts. It just seemed to make too much sense. I\u2019m on the west side of Indianapolis. The practice I purchased is in the Eagle Creek area.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: Are you married? Any children?\n\nHolland: I\u2019m married. I have an anniversary coming up in June. No kids yet, but our dog keeps us busy.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How did you end up at Purdue?\n\nHolland: I played tailback at Chatard, which I think even sometimes I forget. I\u2019d never played defense more than a handful of snaps until I got to Purdue. We always ran the ball at Chatard. I kind of thought I potentially would have the chance to play running back in college. And it became pretty clear that that was not really anybody's plan. I was originally recruited as a safety. The only school that even really mentioned the possibility of starting out at tailback was IU. And I really think that was just a way to try to maybe become a more attractive option. But at that point, I kind of accepted the transition to defense and actually looked forward to the transition.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: What other schools did you consider?\n\nHolland: I was actually offered by Northwestern by Randy Walker just a handful of weeks before he ended up passing away. And so I went up there and I met with Pat Fitzgerald and was very impressed by everything. But I went to a game and it really wasn't a big college football environment. The very next week, I went to Purdue and saw it beat Minnesota. The environment, the stadium, everything about that trip was good. That kind of cemented it. Purdue was always the place I wanted to go. It provided the college football experience, provided the academics, the resources and the support ... it had all I needed.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How tough was it to transition to defense?\n\nHolland: I was wide open to the transition from running back to safety and was looking forward to that. I did not have as open of a mind to the transition from safety to linebacker. I think it was mostly because I got to Purdue at about 205 pounds, and it never came easy to me to gain weight. It was always a struggle to gain size.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: Did anyone talk to you about moving to linebacker from safety?\n\nHolland: (Defensive coordinator/linebackers coach) Brock Spack had mentioned to me in recruitment and during my redshirt year when I was still playing safety that he would love to see me move to linebacker. I think that was probably always the plan. I went through all of my redshirt freshman training camp at safety. And at that time was gonna get in the rotation on nickel and dime situations. I really wasn't gonna play a huge role defensively at that position anyway, and they moved me to outside linebacker right behind Jason Werner. A couple days after they moved me, Jason went down with a season-ending back injury. So, about five days in at linebacker, I was getting ready to start. I took my bumps and bruises that redshirt freshman year. With a little size and a little bit more experience, I got a little better every single year. It really wasn't until my senior year where I really felt like I was well-suited for linebacker and I was playing the position that I should be playing.\n\nGoldandBlack.com: How was your senior year?\n\nHolland: My senior year was a blast because I was fighting. I was bigger and stronger and faster than I've ever had been and things were coming a little more naturally to me than they had in the past. I can't believe how lucky I was to start as many games as I did. And I was in that position by happenstance.\n\nStory continues below photo\n\n"}, {"url": "https://academicallamerica.com/hof.aspx?hof=122", "page_content": "Choose a Hall Of Fame Member: Ackerman, Val Adams, Alvan Ainge, Danny Alvarez, Carlos Ameche, Alan Babik, Jennifer Baker, Terry Balzhiser, Dr. Richard Barber, Tiki Barry, Lynn Norenberg Battier, Shane Beck, Brig.

He chose to take an athletic scholarship to the University of Michigan. Holland had visions of the Rose Bowl going to play for the Wolverines, but once in Ann Arbor found it wasn\u2019t the right fit. As the only player from New York, Holland said, \u201cI found myself getting lost in the crowd because I was a good player, but I wasn\u2019t head-over-heels so talented that I stood out in a crowd.\" Returning home to Cornell University in upstate New York, Holland sat-out his sophomore season, was injured as a junior, and played blocking back on the Big Red offense. As a graduate student in 1978, Holland truly shined. That season he finished second in the country in rushing and scoring, only behind Billy Sims, Oklahoma\u2019s Heisman Trophy winner.\n\n\n\nAfter graduation Holland was accepted at Harvard Law School. Holland was exposed to the issues of the Civil Rights movement and opted out of working at a corporate law firm. He opened a law practice in Harlem, where he hoped to make a difference. \u201cWhen I was making the decision about how I wanted to start my career, I wanted to make my life count for something important. As God has blessed me, I wanted to reach out and bless others.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn addition to a new law practice, Holland founded a homeless shelter. His HARKHOMES project is a means to restore the whole person. His small business initiative for former homeless persons, a Ben and Jerry\u2019s Ice Cream Store, was featured in People Magazine. From all his work and dedication to the issue of homelessness, New York Governor George Pataki appointed him to the State Housing Commission in 1995 and 96.\n\n\n\nHolland married Alisa White, a correspondent for \u201cAmerican Journal,\u201d a television newsmagazine.

IndyStar college sports editor Matthew Glenesk takes a stab at it:\n\nQuarterback\n\nAntwaan Randle El (1998-2001)\n\nAs if it could be anyone else. Randle El did things never done before. He was the first player in Division I history to throw for 40 career touchdowns and rush for 40 career touchdowns. He was the first player in Division I history to amass 2,500 total yards in each of his four seasons. One of the most elusive players in college football history, he led IU's potent option offense and placed sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting as a senior. He finished his career with 7,469 passing yards (second-most in IU history), 3,895 rushing yards (second-most in school history) and 87 total touchdowns. Turned into a wide receiver in the pros, Randle El threw a touchdown pass in Super Bowl XL.\n\nAlso in consideration: Nate Sudfeld, Kellen Lewis, Ben Chappell, Trent Green.\n\nRunning Back\n\nAlex Smith (1994-96), Tevin Coleman (2012-14)\n\nA prep standout at Franklin County, Smith was the first IndyStar Mr. Football. He set a Big Ten freshman rushing record with 1,475 yards and flirted with Herschel Walker's NCAA record. Injury slowed him his sophomore year (769 yards), but he rebounded a year later with 1,248 yards. His 3,492 career rushing yards (in just three seasons) are third-most on the school's all-time rushing list, behind only Anthony Thompson and Antwaan Randle El. Coleman was a threat to score every time he touched the ball and always seemed to hit another gear in the open field. In 2014, he became the first IU running back to eclipse the 2,000-yard mark in a single season, finishing with 2,036, second-best in the nation. His 28 career rushing touchdowns are fourth-most in school history.\n\n\u2022 More: Notre Dame's best from the past 25 years\n\nAlso in consideration: Levron Williams, Stephen Houston, Devine Redding, Jordan Howard.\n\nWide Receiver\n\nJames Hardy (2005-07), Courtney Roby (2001-04)\n\nIU's career leader in receptions (191), receiving yards (2,740) and receiving touchdowns (36), Hardy was a phenom for the Hoosiers, earning first-team All-Big Ten honors as a junior. He was also a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation's top receiver. He led the Big Ten in receiving touchdowns in both 2006 and 2007 and declared early for the draft and was the 41st overall pick. In June, Hardy's body was found in a Fort Wayne river, and his death was later ruled a suicide. An All-State performer at North Central, Roby held the school records for career catches and receiving yards before Hardy broke them.

Despite missing significant time with a concussion his senior year, Feeney was named first-team All-Big Ten, and became the program's first-ever offensive lineman to earn All-America status twice. Spriggs, a year older than Feeney, was also an All-American in 2015, giving IU its first pair of offensive linemen to earn All-America honors in the same season since 1945. As a senior, Spriggs allowed only two sacks in 431 called pass attempts at left tackle. Saffold moved over to left tackle midway through his freshman year and was a fixture there, starting 41 of 42 games he appeared in. He was a two-time second-team All-Big Ten and was drafted at the top of the second round in 2010. DeMar started all 45 games of his college career. He moved around on the line, starting at left guard in 1999, right tackle in 2000, right guard in 2001 and left tackle in 2002. He was a second-time All-Big Ten performer in 2001. A three-year starter at tackle, Liwienski was a team captain his senior year and won IU's lineman of the year award.
