He transformed Egypt from an inward-looking kingdom into a triumphant, conquering nation. And he established a reputation as a brilliant military strategist, one whom later historians would call the \u201cNapoleon of Egypt.\u201d\n\nJust a few months after coming to power, Thutmose III marched with an army of 20,000 soldiers to Megiddo, in modern-day northern Israel\u2014a site better known by its Greek name, Armageddon. A coalition of opponents had gathered there, outside the city. Scribes traveled with Thutmose III\u2019s forces and recorded the campaign\u2019s details, an invaluable chronicle now known as the Annals of Thutmose III.\n\n5:58\n\nThe pharaoh defied his advisers and surprised his foes by surging through a treacherous mountain pass to mount a deadly direct attack on Megiddo. He rode up front during that perilous advance to show that he trusted in the gods to protect him and his troops, and indeed, all made it through the pass unscathed. Then he entered battle at Megiddo \u201con a chariot of fine gold, decked in his shining armor,\u201d dazzling and intimidating his opponents, who soon gave up the fight and retreated to their last bastion of safety within the city walls. Thutmose III laid siege to Megiddo for seven months, mercilessly starving out its remaining inhabitants until they surrendered.\n\nThutmose III flexed his military might repeatedly: in Nubia, in Phoenician ports, in the valuable trade center of Kadesh, and in the kingdom of Mitanni, in modern-day Syria and Turkey. Over the course of 17 campaigns, he secured more territory than any other pharaoh. By the end, he controlled Egypt\u2019s largest ever empire.

But he also secured human capital from his captured lands. The sons of conquered rulers were taken to Egypt and educated at court. Acclimated to Egyptian ways, those offspring returned home sympathetic to Egyptian rule.\n\nUnlike one of his later successors, Ramses II\u2014who exaggerated his military achievements\u2014Thutmose III earned the triumphs recorded on the numerous monuments he built. His annals were inscribed on the sanctuary walls at the great Temple of Amun at Karnak. The Festival Hall there depicts the fauna and flora\u2014including 275 plants\u2014he collected on his Asian campaigns. He installed obelisks at Karnak and built the sun god temple at Heliopolis. And by destroying\u2014albeit incompletely\u2014references to Hatshepsut and her reign, Thutmose III fashioned a direct line to his eponymous predecessors, strengthening his claim and his legacy as the rightful and most powerful ruler of Egypt.\n\nThis text is an excerpt from the National Geographic special issue The Most Influential Figures of Ancient History."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistory.org/Thutmose_III/", "page_content": "Thutmose III (also known as Tuthmosis III, r. 1458-1425 BCE) was the 6th king of Egypt's 18th Dynasty, one of the greatest military leaders in antiquity, and among the most effective and impressive monarchs in Egypt's history. His throne name, Thutmose, means 'Thoth is Born', while his birth name, Menkhperre, means 'Eternal are the Manifestations of Ra'.\n\nBoth of these throne names reference important deities of ancient Egypt Thoth, the god of writing and wisdom, and Ra, the supreme god of the sun. Thutmose III was the son of Thutmose II and a lesser wife named Iset. Thutmose II (r. 1492-1479 BCE) was married to Queen Hatshepsut (r. 1479-1458 BCE), royal daughter of Thutmose I (r. 1520-1492 BCE) and a powerful woman who held the position of God's Wife of Amun.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nWhen Thutmose II died, Hatshepsut became regent of Egypt since Thutmose III was too young to rule. She was supposed to maintain this position but, instead, declared herself pharaoh and ruled independently. Thutmose III, when he came of age and proved himself able, was given command of the armed forces by his step-mother; a choice she would not regret as he proved himself an exceptional military strategist and charismatic leader. He is often referred to in the present day as 'the Napoleon of Egypt', but unlike Napoleon, Thutmose III never lost a single engagement, expanded and maintained his empire, and was worshiped by his people for centuries after his death.\n\nYouth Under Hatshepsut & Rise to Power\n\nThutmose III was born c. 1481 BCE and was only three years old when his father died and Hatshepsut was made regent and then reigning monarch. He grew up at the royal court of Thebes, capital of Egypt throughout most of the period of the New Kingdom (c. 1570 - c. 1069 BCE). Although there is little documentation of his life during this time, a great emphasis was placed on the physical and intellectual development of princes during the New Kingdom of Egypt as they were expected to one day rule over an expanding empire.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThutmose III, therefore, would have spent a great deal of time in school, at athletics, and learning about military tactics and strategies. He probably went along on the early campaigns Hatshepsut commissioned as this was a common practice among New Kingdom pharaohs to acquaint their successors with warfare at an early age. During this time, Thutmose III developed skills in archery, horsemanship, hand-to-hand combat, and athletic ability. There is no doubt that military training was his priority but his education went far beyond battle tactics and the use of weapons; his later reign makes clear he was a highly cultured and sophisticated man who was aware of the value of cultures beyond Egypt's borders, recognized the importance of art and music, and had a great respect for human life.\n\nStatue of King Thutmose III Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin (Copyright)\n\nWhile he was growing up, his step-mother was reigning over one of the most prosperous periods in Egypt's history. After the initial campaigns to secure her position, there were no others throughout Hatshepsut's reign and the army was only deployed in small troops to protect trade expeditions and to maintain the borders. Hatshepsut did not allow her military to stand idle, however, or weaken as evidenced by how quickly Thutmose III was able to mobilize and lead the armies once he came to power.\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\nHatshepsut may have married her daughter Neferu-Ra to Thutmose III in order to secure succession but it does not seem, after his youth, that he spent much time at court. Orientalist James Henry Breasted has suggested he would have probably lived among the soldiers from a fairly early age in order to stay out of Hatshepsut's way and prove himself useful to her reign. It was common enough for noble princes to be removed at the discretion of a reigning monarch who perceived them as a threat and Thutmose III shows too great an ambition to have made himself so vulnerable.\n\nThat he succeeded in his plans is evidenced by the fact that, before the end of her reign, Hatshepsut had placed him in command of her armies. Her reign ended with her death in 1458 BCE, and Thutmose III came to the throne. Hatshepsut had maintained a tight control of Egypt's borders and provinces, but with her death, the kings of Egyptian-controlled states in Canaan and Syria rebelled. Thutmose III was not interested in negotiation and certainly was not going to let these provinces simply leave the empire, and so he set out on his first military campaign.\n\nMilitary Campaigns\n\nIn his time as pharaoh, Thutmose III would lead 17 successful military campaigns in 20 years. He ordered the details of his victories to be inscribed at the Temple of Amun at Karnak and they are considered the most extensive records of ancient Egyptian military campaigns extant. His first is his most famous \u2013 The Battle of Megiddo \u2013 and is the one described in the most exacting narrative. His later campaigns lose this form and are given with less detail, appearing more as lists of spoils than narratives of the king's victories.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nIn his time as pharaoh, Thutmose III would lead 17 successful military campaigns in 20 years.\n\nThe reason for the decline in narrative form is not clear, but the claim of some scholars that it indicates a stronger cohesion of the state in which pragmatic lists of goods superseded narratives of a pharaoh's victory is untenable; there are a number of such narratives in the centuries following Thutmose III's reign, most notably that of Ramesses II (r. 1279-1213 BCE) concerning Kadesh and Ramesses III (r. 1186-1155 BCE) regarding his victory over the Sea Peoples. The most reasonable explanation for the brevity of the later inscriptions is simply that the writer of the Megiddo narrative died.\n\nThe story of the Battle of Megiddo was written by Thutmose III's private secretary, military scribe, and general Tjaneni (also given as Thanuny, c. 1455 BCE) who was with him throughout the event. Tjaneni kept a journal on a leather scroll (later deposited for posterity at the Temple of Amun in Thebes) which Thutmose III so admired he ordered the narrative inscribed on the walls of the temple as well as those of others throughout Egypt.\n\nTjaneni provides a detailed description of Thutmose III as a commander-in-chief fully aware of his abilities and those of his troops and completely confident of victory. In the most famous passage of the account, the pharaoh calls a conference with his senior staff to discuss marching orders to Megiddo and tells them they will be taking the narrow road from Aruna, on which the army will have to march single-file, rather than either of the wider and more easily travelled roads which were available.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe generals object to this, arguing that they have intelligence the enemy is waiting for them at the pass to the plains of Megiddo from the Aruna road and their rearguard will still be marching while the vanguard is engaged with the enemy. Thutmose III hears their counsel but disagrees, telling them that they may take whatever road they choose but he will be leading his army along the Aruna road and will be leading from the front. The generals then agree to follow wherever he chooses to take them.\n\nHis decision on the Aruna road was characteristic of Thutmose III's resolve to pursue a course he considered best regardless of the difficulties. The armies would have had an easier time on the other roads \u2013 especially considering that, on the Aruna path, they had to dismantle and carry the chariots and supply wagons \u2013 but it would have cost the army the element of surprise which Thutmose III recognized as imperative.\n\nTemple of Karnak, Wars of Thutmose III Michael Lusk (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nAs it turned out, the enemy was not waiting at the end of the Aruna road but on the two easier paths which they expected Thutmose III to take at the head of so large an army. No one expected him to lead his forces along what was essentially a cattle path. After giving his army a night to rest and refresh themselves, he ordered the attack the next morning, leading from the front, and drove his opponents from the field. The report then details how his army, delighted at the victory, gathered treasures from the fallen instead of pursuing survivors and taking the city. This cost Thutmose III complete victory on the field that day because it gave the people of Megiddo time to prepare their defenses.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nEven so, Thutmose III marched on the city, surrounded it with a moat and a stockade, and lay siege to it for seven or eight months until it surrendered. He offered very generous terms to the people \u2013 none of the surviving ringleaders of the revolt were executed \u2013 which essentially came down to a promise not to incite rebellion in the future. He then turned his army around and marched back home with his enormous loot from the campaign, pausing only to harvest the crops of the defeated and bring them back to Egypt.\n\nAt Megiddo, he also initiated a policy he would adhere to throughout all his campaigns of bringing the noble children of the defeated kings back to Egypt to be educated as Egyptians. These children were held as hostages to guarantee the good behavior of their parents but were treated with all the respect due to royalty, housed in the palace, and given many freedoms. When they came of age, they were allowed to return home where, since they had now spent their youth in Egypt, they supported and encouraged Egyptian culture and the state's interests when they were elevated to positions of power.\n\nThutmose III's victory at Megiddo gave him control of northern Canaan from which he would launch his campaign into Syria to take Kadesh. He campaigned against the Mitanni and erected a stele at the Euphrates River, commemorated in his inscription at Karnak, known as Thutmose III's Hymn of Victory. His Nubian campaigns were equally successful, and by his 50th year, he had expanded Egypt's holdings beyond any of his predecessors and made the country wealthier than it had been since the beginning of the 4th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2613- 2181 BCE).\n\nPatron of the Arts\n\nHis reign was not only focused on military conquest, however, as his patronage of the arts shows. Thutmose III commissioned upwards of 50 temples, numerous tombs, monuments, and contributed more significantly to the Temple of Amun at Karnak than any other pharaoh. His renovations and additions to the Karnak temple, in fact, are among the most significant in that they preserve the names of past kings (whose monuments he would sometimes remove in his renovations) and provide narratives of his own campaigns and initiatives which have proven to be extremely important to scholars in the study of the culture.\n\nTemple of Amun, Karnak Dennis Jarvis (CC BY-SA)\n\nArtistic techniques and experimentation reached new heights under Thutmose III. Glass-making had been known for centuries but was now perfected to the point where drinking vessels could be made of glass. Statuary was less idealized and more realistic \u2013 a trend begun in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2040-1782 BCE) \u2013 but abandoned in favor of the traditional idealism in art established during the Old Kingdom. Thutmose III is depicted in his statuary as a tall, handsome man in excellent physical condition and this is considered a realistic portrayal in that, first, all depictions are uniform and, second, depictions of others \u2013 also consistent \u2013 are far from flattering.\n\nHis artisans produced some of the finest work in Egypt's history including elaborate tombs decorated with intricate paintings and freestanding columns as well as contributing enormous pylons to Karnak. In keeping with Egypt's respect for and love of nature, he encouraged public parks and gardens, created lakes and ponds for the people's recreation and enjoyment, and had a private garden cultivated both around his palace and at Karnak temple.\n\nDefacement of Hatshepsut's Monuments\n\nHis artistic sensibilities and respect for others are at odds with a policy almost universally ascribed to him: the desecration of Hatshepsut's monuments and the attempt to erase her name from history. Scholars are divided on when this happened in his reign but it was certainly not in the early years. Whenever it transpired, the name and images of Hatshepsut were removed from all public monuments as well as the exterior and some of the interior work at her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri.\n\nTo remove a person's name was to condemn them to non-existence; one needed to be remembered in order to continue one's eternal journey in the afterlife. Further, it was thought that the deceased needed daily sustenance in the form of food and drink offerings delivered to their tombs, where their body was preserved through mummification and statues representing them enabled their soul to visit and partake of these offerings. The so-called Execration Texts of ancient Egypt make clear that the removal of one's name was only justified if that person had committed some serious offense, but there is no evidence of Hatshepsut being involved with any such crimes.\n\nTemple of Hatshepsut, Aerial View N/A (CC BY)\n\nMost likely, Thutmose III ordered this action to prevent Hatshepsut from standing as a role model for future women who might aspire to rule. The position of the monarch of Egypt was traditionally occupied by males and, by assuming power for herself, Hatshepsut had departed from this practice. The first king of Egypt was thought to have been the god Osiris who was murdered by his brother Set and brought back to life by his sister-wife Isis. He was finally succeeded by his son Horus who defeated Set, took back the throne, and re-established order in the land. Kings associated themselves with Horus during their reign and with Osiris, who became Lord of the Dead, in the afterlife; there was no place in this narrative for a woman to hold supreme power.\n\nThe central cultural value of ancient Egypt was ma'at (harmony and balance) and this relied largely on an adherence to tradition. Ancient Egyptians are often characterized as conservative for this reason: departure from tradition could result in a loss of stability \u2013 balance \u2013 and the return of primordial chaos. It was the duty of the pharaoh to maintain ma'at and this is probably the motivation behind Thutmose III's eradication of Hatshepsut's name.\n\nHe backdated his reign to remove all evidence of her ever having ruled Egypt and replaced some of her images in her mortuary temple with his own. All of her public monuments were torn down \u2013 especially those at Karnak \u2013 and replaced by his, though, at other sites, only her name was removed. So thorough was this erasure of his predecessor that Hatshepsut's name was unknown in Egypt's history until the 19th century CE. Later kings of Egypt thought the beautiful Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri was built by Thutmose III, and many of them would claim her impressive monuments as their own.\n\nThutmose III essentially created the Egyptian empire single-handedly.\n\nIt has been suggested that Thutmose III had nothing to do with these actions and that they were perpetrated by his son and successor Amenhotep II (r. 1425-1400 BCE) either in the latter part of Thutmose III's reign or the beginning of his own. Although this is possible, it does not seem probable in that, by the time of Amenhotep II, Thutmose III had already ordered Hatshepsut's works at Karnak removed and replaced by his own. Further, the image and name of Hatshepsut was left intact within the interior of her mortuary temple.\n\nIf Amenhotep II, who never knew Hatshepsut, was trying to erase her from history, it is unlikely he would have spared her memory anywhere. Leaving her name and image intact, but out of the public eye, suggests that Thutmose III was only interested in maintaining the tradition of a male pharaoh in Egypt's history but did not wish his step-mother any ill will.\n\nWhen he died, of natural causes, in c. 1425 BCE, he was buried in his own mortuary temple beside that of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri. Even though he had basically claimed her temple as his own, he still would not have had his eternal resting place located so close to hers if he had sincerely believed she deserved to be sentenced to non-existence.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unfortunate result of this action is that, ever since the rediscovery of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III is as often referenced for her eradication as he is for his many accomplishments and magnificent reign. Thutmose III essentially created the Egyptian empire single-handedly. He elevated Egypt's status as a powerful and prosperous nation, employed the people in monumental building projects, and epitomized the ideal of the valiant Egyptian warrior-king who led his forces to successive victories.\n\nThutmose III's consideration for his enemies in defeat and gentle treatment of them made him respected far beyond the boundaries of his country. He established an empire stretching from the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia, through Syria and the Levant, down through Nubia to the Fifth Cataract of the Nile.\n\nAlthough there is little doubt that the people of these lands would have preferred their independence, they prospered under his reign through the peace he established and maintained through his military and diplomatic skills. In every respect, Thutmose III represented the ideal pharaoh to his people and his memory has endured to the present day as one of the greatest kings of ancient Egypt."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistoryedu.com/thutmose-iii-history-military-campaigns-greatest-achievements/", "page_content": "Thutmose III, one of ancient Egypt\u2019s greatest rulers, was the 6th pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. His reign, which spanned from around 1479 to 1425 BC, was one marked by his unrelenting thirst for dominance and power. Arguably Egypt\u2019s greatest warrior king, Thutmose III built upon the laurels and works of predecessors like his stepmother Hatshepsut and his father Thutmose II.\n\nWith a total of 17 military campaigns, this powerful king was able to stretch the boundaries of Egypt, turning Egypt into the most dominant power in the region. It is generally accepted among Egyptologists and scholars alike that Egypt reached its pinnacle during the reign of Thutmose III. What were some of his most famous military campaigns? And how did Thutmose III bring the mighty Mitannians to submission?\n\nBelow, World History Edu explores the life, family tree, military campaigns, and major achievements of ancient Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nQuick facts about Thutmose III\n\nBirth: c. 1481 BC\n\nDied: c. 1425 BC\n\nAged: 56\n\nBurial place: Valley of the Kings, Luxor, Egypt\n\nReligion: Ancient Egyptian religion\n\nFather: Thutmose II\n\nMother: Iset\n\nSiblings: Neferure\n\nSpouses: Satiah, Nebtu, Menwi, Menhet, Merti, Nebsemi\n\nChief consort: Merytre-Hatshepsut\n\nChildren: Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, Siamun, Nefertiri, Amenemhat, Amenhotep II\n\nReign: 1479-1425 BC\n\nDynasty: 18th\n\nPredecessor: Queen Hatshepsut\n\nSuccessor: Amenhotep II\n\nEpithets: \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d, \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d\n\nOther names: Thutmosis (\u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d or \u201cThoth is born\u201d)\n\nMost known for: Steering ancient Egypt to its zenith ever\n\nConquests: northern Syria, parts of Nubia, Palestine, Niya Kingdom\n\nBirth and early life\n\nSon of Egyptian ruler Thutmose II and Queen Iset, Thutmose III was born around 1481 BC. Following the death of his father in 1479 BC, he was the most eligible person to rise to throne. However, he was only just child at the time. Hence his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut ruled on his behalf as regent of Egypt.\n\nGrowing up, the young boy-king received the best of education befitting of an Egyptian monarch. Thutmose III also received training in military tactics, horse and chariot riding, archery, and among others. Right from an early age, he had a knack for horsemanship, as he was very well built and a good marksman.\n\nNames and epithets\n\nAs it was common for ancient Egyptian kings and queens, Thutmose III went by a number of names and epithets. His two main names were associated with major Egyptian gods Ra and Thoth. For example his name Tuthmosis or Thutmose evokes the meaning of \u201cThoth is born\u201d or \u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d. The god Thoth was the Egyptian deity of the moon, time, and wisdom.\u2019\n\nThutmose III\u2019s other name mn-\u1e2bpr-r\u02c1 \u1e0f\u1e25wty-ms means \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d or \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d. Egyptians believed that the sun god Ra, also known as the chief of the Egyptian pantheon, steered his sun barge through the sky bringing sunlight to land.\n\nThutmose II \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s father\n\nThutmose II was the father of Thutmose III. Born to Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Mutnofret, Thutmose II was the fourth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is said to have started in 1493 and ended upon his death in 1479. During his reign he achieved a number of things, including quelling revolts in the Levant and Nubia.\n\nIn addition to Iset, Thutmose III\u2019s mother, Thutmose II had a number of consorts. Upon his death in 1479, Thutmose II\u2019s chief consort Queen Hatshepsut succeeded him to the throne.\n\nQueen Iset \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s mother\n\nWith Hatshepsut taking the role as the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, Queen Iset was the secondary wife of Thutmose II. Iset\u2019s name was derived from the name of the ancient Egyptian mother goddess Isis. In some ancient texts and inscriptions, Iset is referred to as the chief consort of Thutmose II. Thutmose III\u2019s mother\u2019s name appears on his mummy wrappings as well as a statue of the king in the Karnak Temple Complex. Upon her son\u2019s coronation as the sole ruler of Egypt in 1458 BC (i.e. after the death of Queen Hatshepsut), Iset received the epithet \u201cKing\u2019s Mother\u201d.\n\nA number of Iset\u2019s images and depictions can be found in the tomb of Thutmose III at the Valley of the Kings. Many of those depictions see her revered as the manifestation of the Egyptian goddess Isis. In one depiction, she can be seen standing behind Thutmose III on a boat.\n\nQueen Hatshepsut\u2019s regency, co-regency and ultimate rule\n\nFollowing the death of Thutmose II around 1479 BC, the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut became regent Thutmose II\u2019s only son Thutmose III, who was too young to reign as king. Even long before the death of Thutmose II, Hatshepsut\u2019s power in the kingdom was quite immense, with some describing her as the real power behind Thutmose II\u2019s reign. Thutmose II, a lesser son of Thutmose I, had to marry Hatshepsut in order to consolidate his power.\n\nAbout seven years into her regency, Hatshepsut will go from regent of Egypt to co-ruler of the kingdom until her death in 1458 BC. She thus co-ruled with her stepson Thutmose III. Upon her death, Thutmose III became the sole ruler of Egypt.\n\nHatshepsut assigned herself full titles of a pharaoh. She donned clothes similar to the ones Egyptian pharaohs wore. Bent on dominating the affairs of land of Egypt, she also assumed the insignia of the Egyptian pharaoh. Effectively ruling as pharaoh from c. 1479 to 1458 BC, Hatshepsut, who was also known as \u201cForemost of Noble Ladies\u201d, steered Egypt to great heights.\n\nRead More: 10 Greatest Accomplishments of Queen Hatshepsut\n\nThutmose III and Hatshepsut\n\nUpon attaining the age of maturity, Queen Hatshepsut appointed Thutmose III as the commander of her army. Egyptologists note that Thutmose III served as the co-ruler of Egypt throughout the reign of Hatshepsut. There was hardly any grudge between the two as they worked in tandem. Both rulers had royal names and insignia.\n\nAs a matter of fact their different leadership traits complemented perfectly. Some scholars have noted that the co-rulership of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III proved extremely beneficial for the latter\u2019s sole reign over Egypt.\n\nMajor achievements of Thutmose III\n\nLike many 18th Dynasty pharaohs of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III benefited a lot from the technology transferred to Egypt during the reign of Hyksos rulers [Fifteenth Dynasty (c. 1650-1550 BC)]. Armed with military innovations like the horse and chariot, the sickle sword and the composite bow, Thutmose III embarked on many military campaigns and conquests. By so doing, he was able to wield tremendous influence in the region, from southern Syria and Canaan to the east to Nubia to the south. Ancient Egypt was truly a superpower during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nDuring his reign from 1479 BC to 1425 BC, Thutmose III was able to accomplish a lot of outstanding things. Some of his major accomplishments are as follows:\n\nAncient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon\n\nEgyptologists often opine that there was hardly any ancient Egyptian ruler that could rival the expansionist ambitions of Thutmose III. It\u2019s been estimated that he spent more than twenty years of his thirty-year reign as Egypt\u2019s sole ruler campaigning in foreign lands. It is for this reason some historians like to refer to him as ancient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon.\n\nThutmose III embarked upon a total of 17 campaigns in foreign territories, capturing several hundreds of cities in the process. By the time he was through, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s influence and dominion to places as far as the Near East, Nubia in the south, and the Euphrates.\n\nAn astute commander of Egypt\u2019s army\n\nAs co-ruler and commander of Egypt\u2019s army, Thutmose III prepared himself adequately to reassert Egypt\u2019s influence in northern Syria, Nubia and Palestine. For many years since his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s conquest of those regions, Egypt\u2019s hold over those regions had gradually faded. During his father Thutmose II\u2019s reign, the tributes that Egypt received from those foreign rulers steadily fell.\n\nAnd the fact that Egypt was left with a boy-king following the death of Thutmose II in some way emboldened those foreign Syrian princes to rebel against Egypt\u2019s influence in the region. The task of bringing those regions back under Egypt\u2019s control fell squarely on Thutmose III. Realizing this, co-ruler Queen Hatshepsut was right in naming her stepson and co-ruler Thutmose III the commander-in-chief of Egypt\u2019s army.\n\nBy his mid-20s, he had grown into a fine warrior, knowledgeable in many military tactics and skilled at weapon handling. Thutmose was ready to begin his military campaigns in Syria and other surrounding regions in Mesopotamia.\n\nThutmose III led what was possible the mightiest and largest Egyptian army ever\n\nThutmose III\u2019s early introduction into the army proved extremely useful for him going forward. Steadily he went on to build a very large army that instilled a lot fear in Egypt\u2019s foreign enemies. Historians and Egyptologists like to believe that Thutmose\u2019s reign saw the Egyptian army reach its peak, boasting of the largest army in ancient Egypt\u2019s history.\n\nMarched his army to capture Megiddo\n\nIn what is widely recognized as Thutmose III\u2019s first campaign, the young Egyptian ruler led his army to halt the growing power of the king of Kadesh. Thutmose\u2019s army went through Jamnia before arriving at Megiddo.\n\nBefore facing off the king of Kadesh in the Battle of Megiddo, Thutmose is said to have made a very brave decision of taking the most challenging route to the battle ground. Contrary to the advice of his war counsel, the Egyptian king chose to take the riskiest path through a narrow mountain pass in the Wadi Ara (present-day in Israel). The path allowed Thutmose and his army to strategically place themselves between the rear side of the enemy forces and Megiddo. The battle, which was the biggest of all the 17 campaigns of Thutmose III, ended in a resounding victory for Thutmose. The Pharaoh laid siege to the city for about eight months before bringing Megiddo to its knees. As the troops made their way back to Egypt, they helped themselves to plundering much of the resources of Megiddo.\n\nWielded control over all of Canaan and large parts of Syria\n\nThe capture of Megiddo meant that Thutmose III had placed himself in firm control of all of Canaan and many other parts of Syria. In order to maintain that firm control of those places he ordered the payment of large annual tributes to Egypt. Those foreign lands were also required to send their princes and heirs to Egypt where they were Egyptionalized so to speak. By so doing, Egypt was able to secure strong loyalty from those princes once they turned to rulers of their respective cities.\n\nConquered Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biqa valley\n\nFurthermore, Thutmose conquered many ports on the Phoenician coast, allowing him to gain greater control of Syria. After plundering the town of Ardata, he turned the place into an important strategic base for Egypt. In his sixth campaign, the Egyptian king proceeded to take and pillage many Kadesh territories. As part of his effort to prevent those conquered territories from rebelling, he sometimes plundered a lot of their resources, thereby leaving them impoverished with no ability to mount a rebellion.\n\nBrought the state of Mitanni under Egypt\u2019s control\n\nBeginning around the end of Thutmose III\u2019s grandfather\u2019s reign, Thutmose I, the rulers of Mitanni, a Mesopotamian kingdom, had started to grow in power and influence in the region. Thutmose III was bent on clipping Mitanni\u2019s rise. In his 33rd year, he led his army on an eight campaign. After crossing the Euphrates River, he took on the Mitannian forces, who were anything but ready for an invasion. The king of Mitanni fled, allowing Thutmose III to force Mitanni into complete submission. The Egyptian king is said to have taking about more than 30 members of the Mitannian\u2019s harem and several hundreds of soldiers prisoners.\n\nTo commemorate his spectacular victory, he erected a stele next to his grandfather\u2019s stele in the region. Thutmose thus became the first Egyptian monarch since Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates.\n\nA prominent builder of spectacular buildings\n\nA great patron of the arts and architecture, Thutmose III is said to have tasked his architects to build many magnificent structures, most famous among them came at the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Thutmose is credited with enlarging the complex by erecting new buildings and obelisks. For example he rebuilt his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s hypostyle hall. He also built a jubilee hall to mark his reign during the Sed festival. He also built a new temple at Dayr al-Bahri, just close to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple.\n\nMore Thutmose III facts\n\nAs a result of the immense influence he had, many foreign princes and monarchs, from the Hittite region to the Mesopotamian region, frequently presented him a wide array of gifts. Rulers from as far as the Aegean and the Greek mainland sent envoys and gifts to Thutmose III.\n\nMuch of what we know about Thutmose III comes from the records of Thanuny, a royal scribe and commander in Thutmose III\u2019s army.\n\nHe was a known hunter of elephant in the land of Niy in the Orontes Valley.\n\nOften times, the prisoners of war and the loot that he took from foreign lands were presented to the god Amun (Amon).\n\nAfter conquering a foreign land, Thutmose III would deploy native rulers to govern those territories. Those rulers were required to remain loyal, keep the peace, and pay annual tributes to Egypt. During his reign, Egypt received tributes from Nubia (Sudan), Syria, and Palestine.\n\nTypical of many Egyptian pharaohs, the records of Thutmose III are a bit boastful, exaggerating the abilities of the Egyptian king.\n\nIt was during Thutmose III\u2019s reign that Egyptian artisans mastered glass making.\n\nIn his final few years on the throne, some of his courtiers, along with his heir Amenhotep II, tried to erase the records, including images and cartouches, of Hatshepsut and her reign. In some cases, Hatshepsut\u2019s achievements were appropriated to Thutmose II and Thutmose I.\n\nHe loved to bring animals and plants from far and wide into his kingdom. Some of those foreign beasts and plants can be seen on the walls of the Festival Hall at Karnak.\n\nFor quite a number of centuries, Egyptians took to inscribing the name of Thutmose III on amulets. It was believed that those amulets protected the wearer.\n\nMummy and memorial temple\n\nThutmose III was buried in a very remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes.\n\nHis mummy was discovered in 1889. Archaeologists believe that the 21st dynasty priest-kings (1076- c. 945 BC) kept his mummy in that place in order to protect it from being desecrated.\n\nBased on his mummy, Thutmose III\u2019s height was in the region of five feet three inches (around 1.6 meters).\n\nDiscovered in 1962, Thutmose III\u2019s memorial temple was sited next to Hatshepsut\u2019s memorial temple in Dayr al-Bahri.\n\nMore Thutmose III achievements\n\nHis final military campaign saw him put down a rebellion (instigated by some exiled members of the Mitannian royal family) in the Arka plain. He also destroyed many Mitannian garrisons in the region.\n\nAround his 50th regnal year, he turned his attention to his southern borders, where he captured many Nubian territories, including Napata and Kurgus. He is famed for being the first Egyptian king to march an army as far as the fourth cataract of the Nile River.\n\nShortly after securing those Nubian regions, he erected a temple in honor of the god Amun. He also captured a number of prisoners that he would later send to the gold mines. Scholars state that the produce from those gold mines formed a significant portion of Egypt\u2019s wealth.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s consorts and children\n\nIn some texts it\u2019s noted that Thutmose III married his half-sister Neferure, who was the daughter of Thutmose II and Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut. Neferure was at some point was even referred to as the God\u2019s Wife.\n\nIn another account, the great royal wife of Thutmose III was rather Merytre-Hatshepsut. By her, Thutmose III gave birth to Amenhotep II, his successor. Merytre-Hatshepsut became the chief consort of the king after the death of Satiah. Additionally, Merytre-Hatshepsut was the mother of Thutmose\u2019s successor Amenhotep II. In the course of her life, Merytre-Hatshepsut had titles like Great King\u2019s Wife, God\u2019s Wife, King\u2019s Mother, Sole One, Beloved of Ra, and First among the nobles.\n\nOther famous wives of Thutmose III include Menwi, Merti, and Menhet. Those three women were princesses from foreign lands who were sent to the royal harem of the pharaoh. Although they were regarded as minor wives of the king, the three women still held a bit of influence in the royal court, receiving titles like King\u2019s Wife.\n\nThutmose III also had the likes of Nebtu, Nebsemi and Satiah in his royal harem. It\u2019s been stated that by later, Thutmose III bore his eldest son Prince Amenemhat. Satiah was psossibly Thutmose III\u2019s first Great Royal Wife.\n\nKing Thutmose III had many children, including Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, and Nefertiri.\n\nFamily Tree of Thutmose III\n\nSuccessor\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign spanned for about 54 years; the first twenty-two years of his reign was spent serving as the co-ruler of Egypt with his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut. In his final few years, he appointed his son and heir Amenhotep II as a junior co-regent.\n\nHis eldest son and heir, Amenemhat, predeceased him, possibly dying of a plague. Following the death of Amenemhat, Amenhotep II became heir to Thutmose III."}, {"url": "https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-famous-people/thutmose-iii-0018105", "page_content": "The power that marked the rise of Ancient Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom period rested solely on the shoulders of capable pharaohs. Such a vast realm could never thrive if it weren\u2019t for leaders that were bold, confident, and eager to expand their territories. One such pharaoh was Thutmose III, widely regarded as one of Ancient Egypt's greatest rulers ever. With a lengthy reign and a relentless drive towards Egyptian expansion, Thutmose ushered his realm into a new golden age. What were some defining moments in his reign?\n\nOn the Threshold of a New Golden Age with Pharaoh Thutmose III\n\nThe official regnal dates for Thutmose III are 28th April 1479 BC to 11th March 1425 BC. This means that the pharaoh ruled Egypt for roughly 54 years. That is an incredibly lengthy reign for any monarch, especially at a time when many wanted to usurp the throne. However, we must consider that Thutmose officially became a pharaoh when he was only two years old. Historians can provide such a precise number thanks to funerary inscriptions discovered within the tomb of a military commander from the time of Thutmose. This commander was Amenemheb-Mahu, and on the walls of his tomb it is recorded that Thutmose III died in his 54th regnal year.\n\nOf course, it was impossible for Thutmose III to rule so young. His father, Thutmose II, died after a relatively short reign, and was survived by his Great Royal Wife, Hatshepsut, as well as his children. Thus, the effective power was left in the hands of Hatshepsut, who declared herself to be the regent to the boy king. Soon she declared herself Pharaoh, but never attempted to oust Thutmose III or deny his right to the throne. Still, growing up, the boy had little effective power in the realm, and Egypt was ruled by Hatshepsut for roughly 21 years. During this time, the queen began numerous new building projects, and the realm prospered steadily.\n\nBecoming an able and promising young man, Thutmose III was made the foremost leader of Ancient Egypt\u2019s armies, during Hatshepsut\u2019s effective reign. This was the start of a promising military career, and the development of Thutmose\u2019s fantastic ability as a strategist and tactician. In fact, he demonstrated such great capabilities in this role, and would later prove to be an unparalleled commander. Historians today regard Thutmose III as a pure military genius, and this has earned him the nickname of \u201cthe Napoleon of Egypt\u201d.\n\nLarge Kneeling Statue of Hatshepsut. (Metropolitan Museum of Art/ CC0)\n\nA Time for Conquest and a Time for Expansion\n\nUpon the death of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III effectively assumed his rightful role as the Pharaoh. He was now roughly 25 years old, and already proven as a commander. Soon enough, he began a decisive expansion of Egypt\u2019s borders. He is today considered as one of the greatest conquerors in the timeline of Ancient Egypt, and was certainly an aggressive expansionist ruler.\n\nHis first successes began almost immediately after he assumed the throne: he led a campaign deep into modern-day Israel, where he won a masterful battle at Megiddo, defeating the King of Kadesh. With a daring move, he marched his armies to the rear of the Megiddo forces, crushing them decisively.\n\nSoon after this victory, Egyptian dominance was reasserted in the region called Canaan. And that was just the beginning of Thutmose\u2019s achievements. He methodically assaulted city after city, slowly beating his enemies into submission. Over the course of his lengthy reign, it is said that he captured no less than 350 cities. He conquered most of the Near East, from the River Euphrates all the way down to Nubia in the south. And we know precisely that he conducted 17 military campaigns in his reign - an impressive number.\n\nAncient Egypt quickly marched into a new Golden Age. With reasserted dominance, with expanded borders and new victories, the realm prospered in every regard. And all this thanks to the warrior Pharaoh, Thutmose III. Barely in his 30s, he was already crowned with the laurel wreath of victory, and loved by the people. Meticulously and decisively, he transformed Ancient Egypt into a true \u201cinternational\u201d superpower, reshaping it into an empire that incorporated regions of Syria, Canaan, Nubia, and others.\n\nThutmose III Sphinx sculpture, 18th Dynasty of Egypt, 1550-1295 BC. Held at the Louvre Museum. (Louvre Museum/ CC BY-SA 2.0 FR )\n\nThe Napoleon of Ancient Egypt\n\nLuckily, we know a lot about Thutmose\u2019s military achievements because of fairly detailed records that survive. Many of his triumphs were inscribed onto the walls of the Temple of Amun in Karnak, accompanied by stunning reliefs of the king subduing his enemies. Furthermore, Thutmose had a royal scribe and a loyal commander, Thanuny, who kept meticulous records of his king\u2019s campaigns. Fragments of these scripts allowed us a greater insight into methods of ancient warfare and strategy.\n\nAnother contributing factor to Thutmose\u2019s military success is a number of innovations and new technologies that placed him one step ahead of his enemies. Roughly two centuries before his time, Ancient Egypt came under the brief rule of the Hyksos, foreign invaders who brought with them new and never before seen tools and weapons. New unique swords were quickly absorbed by the Egyptians, as well as new forging techniques, as well as powerful two-wheeled war chariots. With all these innovations, the Egyptian army was well suited for conquest.\n\nSoon after winning the key battle at Megiddo, Thutmose solidified Egypt\u2019s domination in Canaan, and began a series of conquests that would lead Egypt to its greatest ever expansion. All the greatest kings of the region - of the Hittites, Babylonians, and Assyrians - gave him tribute. He then led campaigns against the powerful Phoenician ports, and the quarrelsome Mitanni to the north. Through his victories, he expanded his realm\u2019s wealth: slaves were acquired, sheep and horses, thousands of cattle, powerful stallions, money and riches, many tons of grain, quality wood from Lebanon, and noble hostages that made obedience guaranteed.\n\nRelief in the Karnak Temple showing Thutmose III slaying Canaanite captives from the Battle of Megiddo, 15th Century BC . (Olaf Tausch/ CC BY 3.0 )\n\nA Golden King in a Golden Era\n\nOver the course of 17 campaigns, most - if not all - of his enemies were subdued, the foremost being the Mitanni. But it was not all about warfare: Thutmose III was also inclined to spur other developments within Egypt as well. New construction projects were begun, and new technologies mastered. Glass-making was refined, and a number of new lavish buildings were raised in Karnak. Several monumental obelisks from this time also survive.\n\nThutmose III died in his 56th year (54th regnal year). His remains were entombed in a unique and lavish tomb in the Valley of the Kings, and his mummy survives to this day. Succeeding him was his younger son, Amenhotep II. The latter\u2019s reign was successful, but not nearly as good as his father\u2019s. Likewise, Amenhotep conducted only a few campaigns to maintain his domination.\n\nTogether with Rameses the Great , Thutmose is widely regarded as Ancient Egypt\u2019s finest pharaoh. And considering that the history of this civilization spans several thousands of years, that achievement can be considered monumental.\n\nTop image: The statue of Pharaoh Thutmose III at the Karnak Temple Complex in Luxor, Egypt.

The battle itself was a decisive victory for Egypt and the seven- or eight-month siege which followed reduced the power of the subject kings, gave Thutmose III control of northern Canaan (from which he launched his campaigns into Mesopotamia), and elevated the Egyptian king's status to legend.\n\nBattle of Megiddo Relief Olaf Tausch (GNU FDL)\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II (1492-1479 BCE) by a lesser wife named Iset. Thutmose II's great royal wife was Hatshepsut (1479-1458 BCE), who was appointed regent to the young Thutmose III upon the death of his father. Hatshepsut, however, broke with the tradition which insisted on a male pharaoh and assumed the position herself.\n\nThutmose III grew up at court and received extensive military training as was expected for a prince in the period of the New Kingdom of Egypt (c. 1570 - c. 1069 BCE), the age of empire. When Hatshepsut died, Thutmose III came to power, and believing him to be weak and inexperienced, the king of the Syrian city of Kadesh incited a rebellion in the Egyptian province of Canaan which quickly gained support from other regions hoping to cast off Egyptian rule. This coalition assembled at the city of Megiddo.\n\nIn c. April of 1457 BCE, Thutmose III marched his army from Thebes to Megiddo in northern Canaan (northern Israel in the present day), prudently chose to approach the city by a narrow pass from the town of Aruna \u2013 instead of the wider and easier routes to the city \u2013 and surprised his enemies by entering the Qina Valley behind their defensive positions and driving them from the field. The entire campaign could have been ended that day, had the Egyptian army not halted their pursuit of survivors to collect treasures and trophies from the field; Thutmose III had to lay siege to the city to take it.\n\nThutmose III's commander and military scribe Tjaneni (also given as Thanuny, c. 1455 BCE) naturally accompanied his king on the campaign to put down the revolt and kept a journal detailing the engagement. Tjaneni's account so pleased Thutmose III that he had portions of it inscribed on the walls of the great Temple of Amun at Karnak and, to lesser extents, elsewhere. Tjaneni's report is among the most detailed of any campaign in Egypt's history including that of Ramesses II's famous account of The Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BCE.\n\nTemple of Karnak, Wars of Thutmose III Michael Lusk (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nTjaneni begins by explaining why the inscription is to be found engraved on the temple's walls. He then proceeds to detail the campaign and the reasons for it. The 'wretched enemy' mentioned periodically is the king of Kadesh who initiated the rebellion and organized the forces against Egypt but at some points is used to designate all who had joined the rebellion. Following the Battle of Megiddo, Thutmose III would subjugate and punish all who participated, conquering not only Kadesh but all of Syria and the lands of the Mitanni in Mesopotamia, among others.\n\nThe following translation is by James B.

Some passages have been omitted here for brevity or because they are incomplete or unclear. At points, a passage will be summarized in parentheses for clarity and to maintain narrative form. Brackets are used to clarify dates, expressions, or certain locations:\n\nHis majesty commanded that the victories which his father Amun had given to him should be established upon a monument in the temple which his majest had made for his father Amun, in order to set down each individual campaign together with the booty which his majesty carried off from it and the dues of every foreign country which his father Ra had given to him.\n\nYear 22, 4th month of the second season, day 25 [possibly 16 April 1457 BCE]. His majesty passed the fortress of Sile [on the Egyptian frontier] on the first campaign of victory which his majesty made to extend the frontiers of Egypt, in valor, in victory, in power, and in justification. Now this was a long time in years\u2026while every man was tributary before Egypt. But it happened in later times that the garrison which was there was in the town of Sharuhen while from Iursa to the outer ends of the earth [from southern Canaan to northern Syria] had become rebellious against his majesty.\n\n(The army marched at a rate of 150 miles in 10 days to reach Gaza where they rested. They then moved on to the town of Yehem near Aruna where Thutmose III called a council of his commanders. There were three ways the army could travel to Megiddo: a narrow path where the troops would have to march single-file, a road to the south, and another to the north both of which were wider and would allow for an easier movement of the army. Thutmose III had decided on the narrow road from Aruna; his generals wanted to go by either of the two other easier routes).\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nHis majesty ordered a conference with his victorious army, speaking as follows:\n\n\"That wretched enemy of Kadesh has come and has entered into Megiddo. He there at this very moment. He has gathered to him the princes of every foreign country which had been loyal to Egypt, as well as those as far as Naharin and Mitanni, them of Hurru, them of Kode, their horses, their armies, and their people, for he says \u2013 so it is reported - 'I shall wait here in Megiddo to fight against his majesty'. Will you tell me what is in your hearts?\"\n\nThey said in the presence of his majesty: \"What is it like to go on this road which becomes so narrow? It is reported that the foe is there, waiting on the outside, while they are becoming more numerous. Will not horse have to go after horse and the army and the people similarly? Will the vanguard of us be fighting while the rear guard is waiting here in Aruna unable to fight? Now, two other roads are here. One of the roads \u2013 behold, it is to the east of us, so that it comes out at Taanach. The other \u2013 behold, it is to the north side of Djefti, and we will come out to the north of Megiddo. Let our victorious lord proceed on the one of them which is satisfactory to his heart but do not make us go on that difficult road!\"\n\nThen messages were brought in about that wretched enemy and discussion was continued of that problem on which they had previously spoken. That which was said in the majesty of the Court \u2013 life, prosperity, health [a common blessing regarding pharaoh. Thutmose III spoke to the assembly:]\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\n\"I swear, as Ra loves me, as my father Amun favors me, as my nostrils are rejuvenated with life and satisfaction, my majesty shall proceed upon this Aruna road! Let him of you who wishes go upon these roads of which you speak and let him of you who wishes come in the following of my majesty! 'Behold', they will say, these enemies whom Ra abominates, 'has his majesty set out on another road because he has become afraid of us?' \u2013 So they will speak.\"\n\nThey said in the presence of his majesty:\n\n\"May thy father Amun, Lord of the Thrones of the Two Lands, Presiding over Karnak, act according to thy desire! Behold, we are following they majesty everywhere that thy majesty goes, for a servant will be after his lord.\"\n\nThen his majesty laid a charge upon the entire army:\n\n\"Ye shall hold fast to the stride of your victorious lord on that road which becomes so narrow. Behold, his majesty has taken an oath, saying: 'I will not let my victorious army go forth ahead of my majesty in this place!'\"\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nNow, his majesty had laid it in his heart that he himself should go forth at the head of his army. Every man was made aware of his order of march, horse following horse, while his majesty was at the head of his army.\n\n(The army traveled by the narrow road from Aruna to Megiddo. The men marched in single-file, leading the horses. The chariots were dismantled and carried by the soldiers. Although reports had been received that the enemy would be waiting for them at the end of the narrow road, they found no one there. The coalition expected Thutmose III to take either of the easier paths and were actually waiting for him at the end of those roads.)\n\nThen his majesty issued forth [from the narrow road] at the head of his army which was prepared in many ranks. He had not met a single enemy. Their southern wing was in Taanach while their northern wing was on the south side of the Qina valley. Then his majesty rallied [his troops] saying: \"They are fallen! While that wretched enemy [watched for us in the wrong place, we have arrived to surprise them.] May ye give praise to Amun; may he extol the might of his majesty, because his arm is greater than that of any king. It has indeed protected the rear of his majesty's army in Aruna!\"\n\nNow while the rear of his majesty's victorious army was still at the town of Aruna, the vanguard had come out into Qina Valley and they filled the mouth of this valley.\n\nThen they [his generals] said to his majesty \u2013 life, prosperity, health! \u2013 \"Behold, his majesty has come forth with his victorious army and they have filled the valley. Let our victorious lord listen to us this time and let our lord guard for us the rear of his army and his people. When the rear of the army comes forth for us into the open, then we shall fight against these foreigners, then we shall not trouble our hearts about the rear of our army.\"\n\nA halt was made by his majesty outside [of the valley] and he [sat] there guarding the rear of his victorious army. Now the leaders had just finished coming forth on this road when the shadow turned [meaning it was noon, when the sundial had to be repositioned. It took seven hours before the rearguard caught up to the vanguard of the army in the valley]. His majesty reached the south of Megiddo on the bank of the Qina brook when the seventh hour was in its course in the day.\n\nThen a camp was pitched there for his majesty and a charge was laid upon the entire army, saying: \"Prepare ye! Make your weapons ready, since one will engage in combat with that wretched enemy in the morning.\"\n\nResting in the enclosure of life, prosperity, and health [in the royal pavilion] the pharaoh provided for the officials, issuing rations to the retinue, posting the sentries of the army, saying to them: \"Be steadfast, be steadfast! Be vigilant, be vigilant!\" Awakening in life in the tent of life, prosperity, and health [he met with his messengers]. They came to tell his majesty: \"The desert is well and the garrisons of the south and north also!\"\n\nHis majesty set forth in a chariot of fine gold, adorned with his accoutrements of combat, like Horus, the Mighty of Arm, a lord of action like Montu, the Theban, while his father Amun made strong his arms. The southern wing of his majesty's army was at a hill south of the Qina brook and the northern wing was to the northwest of Megiddo, while his majesty was in their center. Amun being the protection of his person in the melee and the strength of Set pervading his members.\n\nThereupon his majesty prevailed over them at the head of his army. Then they [the enemy] saw his majesty prevailing over them, and they fled headlong to Megiddo with faces of fear. They abandoned their horses and their chariots of gold and silver so that someone might draw them up into this town by hoisting on their garments. Now, the people had shut this town against them but they let down garments to hoist them up into this town. Now, if only his majesty's army had not given up their hearts to capturing the possessions of the enemy, they would have captured Megiddo at this time, while the wretched enemy of Kadesh and the wretched enemy of this town were being dragged up hastily to get them into their town, for fear of his majesty entered their bodies and their arms were weak for his serpent-diadem had overpowered them.\n\nThen their horses and their chariots of gold and silver were captured as easy as prey. Ranks of them were lying stretched out on their backs like fish in the bight of a net while his majesty's victorious army counted up their possessions. Now there was captured that wretched enemy's tent which was worked with silver.\n\nThen the entire army rejoiced and gave praise to Amun because of the victory which he had given to his son on this day. They lauded his majesty and extolled his victories. Then they presented the plunder which they had taken: hands [hands cut off as spoils of war], living prisoners, horses, and chariots of fold and silver and of painted work.\n\nThen his majesty commanded his army with these words:\n\n\"Capture ye effectively, my victorious army! Behold, all foreign countries have been put in this town by the command of Ra on this day, inasmuch as every prince of every northern country is shut up within it for the capturing of Megiddo is the capturing of a thousand towns! Capture ye firmly, Firmly!\"\n\nOrders were issued to the commanders of the troops to provide for their divisions and to inform each man of his place. They measured this city, which was corralled with a moat and enclosed with fresh timbers of all their pleasant trees, while his majesty himself was in a fortress east of this town, being watchful. He ordered the town enclosed with a girdled wall. Its name was called \"Men-kheper-Ra-is-the Corraller-of-the-Asiatics.\" People were appointed as sentries at the enclosure of his majesty and they were told: \"Be steadfast, be steadfast! Be vigilant, be vigilant!\" Not one of them was permitted to go outside from behind this wall except to come out at a knock on the door of their fortress [by an Egyptian].\n\nNow everything which his majesty did to this town and to that wretched enemy and his wretched army is set down by the individual day by the individual expedition and by the individual troop commanders.

Hatshepsut's death led surrounding nations, whom they previously had good relations with, to want to conquer Egypt. The skilled commander-pharaoh, however, decided to lead military campaigns on these nations to prevent this.\n\nThutmose III's first and most famous battle was the Battle of Megiddo. Though his advisors told him to take the main paths to Megiddo, Thutmose III was a skilled strategist and took the castle road, meaning his army had to travel a single-file path. As Thutmose had thought, the enemy was waiting at the ends of the main roads, so the Egyptian army had the element of surprise and after about eight months, conquered the city of Megiddo. Instead of executing the leaders, he brought their children to Egypt to be educated as royals, keeping the foreign leaders happy and spreading Egyptian culture.\n\nAfter conquering Megiddo, he campaigned against the Mittani, who resided in what is now modern-day Turkey, as well as conquering Kadesh in Syria. Perhaps one of his greatest accomplishments was conquering Nubia, a region near the Valley of the Kings (where most pharaohs were buried) that became annexed to Egypt. Thutmose III's reign made Egypt wealthier and more widespread than it had been for about a thousand years.\n\nArt & Architecture\n\nIn addition to his many military accomplishments, art and architecture thrived under Thutmose III's reign. He commissioned the building of over 50 temples, monuments, and other structures. He provided the greatest contribution of any pharaoh to the Temple of Karnak, a temple dedicated to several Egyptian gods. Thutmose III's impressive military accomplishments were carved into pylons that were added to the temple. In fact, we actually have more detailed records of Thutmose III's battles than any other pharaoh. During his Battle of Megiddo, Tjaneni, one of his generals who acted as his secretary and scribe, wrote of the pharaoh's actions in epic detail, which Thutmose III ordered to be inscribed in the temple."}, {"url": "https://www.givemehistory.com/king-thutmose-iii", "page_content": "Thutmose III (1458-1425 BCE) also known as Tuthmosis III was Egypt\u2019s 6th king of the 18th Dynasty. He forged an enduring reputation as one of antiquity\u2019s greatest military leaders. This military prowess set the platform for his position as one of Egypt\u2019s most effective monarchs. His throne name, Thutmose, translates as \u2018Thoth is Born,\u2019 while \u2018Menkhperre\u2019 his birth name means \u2018Eternal are the Manifestations of Ra.\u2019 Both Thutmose III\u2019s names acknowledged two of ancient Egypt\u2019s most powerful deities.\n\nFacts About Thutmose III\n\n6th king of Egypt\u2019s 18th Dynasty and national hero, Thutmose III was revered by his people\n\nOne of antiquity\u2019s greatest military leaders, successfully leading 17 military campaigns in 20 years, amassing enormous wealth for Egypt\n\nA military genius, he mastered the art of surprise attacks, rapid movement, logistics and lines of supply\n\nThutmose III\u2019s artisans created some of the finest work in Egypt\u2019s history, from elaborate tombs enlivened with ornate paintings to the massive pylons in Karnak, painting, sculpting and glass making flowered\n\nHe erected many of Egypt\u2019s majestic obelisks including those now set in New York, Istanbul, Rome and London today\n\nThutmose III\u2019s Family Lineage\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II (1492-1479 BCE) and Iset one of Thutmose II\u2019s lesser wives. Thutmose II was also married to Queen Hatshepsut (1479-1458 BCE), a royal daughter of Thutmose I (1520-1492 BCE) who also carried out the role of God\u2019s Wife of Amun..\n\nWhen Thutmose II died, Thutmose III was only three years old, too young to rule so Hatshepsut became regent. Hatshepsut later declared herself pharaoh and assumed the throne herself, emerging as one of the most powerful women in Egyptian history.\n\nWhen Thutmose III came of age his stepmother gave him command of Egypt\u2019s armed forces. It was an inspired decision, even if politically motivated. Thutmose III proved himself to be a charismatic leader and an exceptional military strategist.\n\nThutmose III During Hatshepsut\u2019s Regency And His Rise To Power\n\nThutmose III grew up at the royal court in Egypt\u2019s capital Thebes. Little documented evidence of his early life survived. However as was the custom in Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom, the physical and intellectual development of a prince was a major focus of their education.\n\nThutmose III is believed to have studied military tactics and strategies together with athletics while in school. It is also thought he participated in Hatshepsut\u2019s early campaigns abroad. It was common practice amongst New Kingdom pharaohs to immerse their successors in the military at an early age. During this time, Thutmose III is said to have honed his skills in hand-to-hand combat, archery and horsemanship.\n\nDuring Thutmose III\u2019s formative years, his stepmother reigned over one of Egypt\u2019s most prosperous times. Once Hatshepsut\u2019s initial campaigns had secured her reign, there were few major overseas deployments and the army primarily focused on protecting trade and maintaining orders along Egypt\u2019s long borders.\n\nUpon Hatshepsut\u2019s death in 1458 BCE, and Thutmose III\u2019s ascension to the throne, the kings of Egyptian-vassal states in Syria and Canaan rebelled. Thutmose III preferred direct action rather than negotiation so he left Egypt on his first military campaign.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s Military Campaigns\n\nDuring his time on the throne, Thutmose III successfully led 17 military campaigns in 20 years. At the pharaoh\u2019s direction, details of his victories were inscribed at Karnak\u2019s Temple of Amun. Today, there are acknowledged to be the most exhaustive records of ancient Egypt\u2019s military campaigns in existence.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s first campaign climaxed at The Battle of Megiddo, his most famous battle. The account of the campaign comes to us from Thutmose III\u2019s private secretary (c. 1455 BCE).\n\nTjaneni provides a detailed description of Thutmose III as a commander-in-chief supremely confident in his own ability and of victory. By taking a little-used cattle track, Thutmose III achieved tactical surprise and routed his enemy. Thutmose III then marched on the city and besieged it for eight months until they surrendered. Thutmose III returned home laden with an enormous campaign loot, having lingered only to harvest the defeated army\u2019s crops.\n\nMegiddo saw Thutmose III initiate a policy that continued throughout all his subsequent campaigns. He brought the noble children of defeated kings back to Egypt to be educated as Egyptians. When they came of age, they were allowed to return home where many continued supporting Egyptian interests.\n\nVictory at Megiddo gave Thutmose III control of northern Canaan. His Nubian campaigns proved equally successful. By Thutmose III\u2019s 50th year, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s borders beyond those of any of his predecessors, making Egypt wealthier than it had been at any time since the start of the Old Kingdom\u2019s 4th Dynasty (c. 2613- 2181 BCE).\n\nThutmose III And The Arts\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign was not only absorbed by military campaigns. His patronage of the arts extended to his commissioning of 50 temples along with countless monuments and tombs. Thutmose III also contributed more to the Temple of Amun at Karnak than other pharaohs. Ironically, his refurbishment of the Karnak temple preserved the names of past kings and provided descriptions outlining of his own military campaigns.\n\nUnder Thutmose III, artistic skills flowered. Glass making was refined and mastered. Statuary adopted less idealized and more realistic styles. Thutmose III\u2019s artisans created some of the finest work in Egypt\u2019s long history. From elaborate tombs embellished with complex paintings and freestanding columns to the massive pylons in Karnak. Thutmose III also created public parks and gardens, complete with ponds and lakes for his subject\u2019s recreation, while a private garden surrounded both his palace and his Karnak temple.\n\nDefacing Hatshepsut\u2019s Monuments\n\nOne of the most controversial acts attributed to Thutmose III is his desecration of Hatshepsut\u2019s monuments and his attempt to erase her name from historical records.\n\nAccording to Egyptian religious belief, to expunge a person\u2019s name was to doom them to non-existence. For an ancient Egyptian to continue their eternal journey in the afterlife they needed to be remembered.\n\nThe current view amongst most scholars is that Thutmose III ordered this campaign to prevent Hatshepsut from becoming a role model for future Queens who may aspire to rule. In the Egyptian afterlife, there was no place in the narrative for a woman to ascend the throne and wield power.\n\nOne of the key responsibilities of a pharaoh was to maintain ma\u2019at, the principle of harmony and balance at the heart of ancient Egyptian culture. This is thought to be the motivation behind Thutmose III\u2019s expunction of Hatshepsut\u2019s name.\n\nLegacy\n\nThutmose III left a substantial legacy of military greatness. Thutmose III took an isolated and weakened nation and transformed Egypt into an imperial power. By carving an empire stretching from the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia across to Syria and the Levant and down to the Fifth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia, Thutmose III cemented Egypt\u2019s influence as a powerful and prosperous nation. Thutmose III epitomized the ideal of the Egyptian warrior-king who led his military to successive glorious victories, cementing his status as an Egyptian national hero and one of the greatest kings of ancient Egypt.\n\nReflecting On The Past\n\nWas Thutmose III really an ancient Napoleon, a brilliant general who never lost a battle or merely a skilled propagandist who stole Hatshepsut\u2019s legacy?\n\nHeader image courtesy: Louvre Museum [CC BY-SA 2.0 fr], via Wikimedia Commons"}, {"url": "https://historicaleve.com/thutmose-iii-army-of-ancient-egypt/", "page_content": "A powerful infantry, an efficient corps of war chariots and a large fleet sustained the conquest of Thutmose III, who fought a fight to the death against the kingdom of Mitanni, Egypt\u2019s greatest Asian enemy.\n\nHe was not destined to reign. Thutmose III only came to the throne of Egypt because his father, Pharaoh Thutmose II, and his Great Royal Wife, Queen Hatshepsut, had no male descendants.\n\nSo it was he, son of the pharaoh and a secondary wife, who ended up ruling the Nile country. In this case, chance was generous with Egypt because Thutmose had all the necessary qualities for a good ruler and one more: his extraordinary military capability, which, coupled with foolproof courage, earned him the loyalty of the most powerful army in the Middle East.\n\nAt the command of these troops, Thutmose III forged an empire that ran from present-day Syria to the fourth cataract of the Nile, in what is now Sudan. With this, the dominions of Pharaonic Egypt reached the maximum extension of all its history.\n\nIn pursuit of this ambitious expansion, the army fought up to seventeen times in Asian lands, between the Sinai Peninsula and the Euphrates River.\n\nAlong this river stretched the dominions of Mitanni, which at that time was Egypt\u2019s deadliest enemy. The two states clashed violently over the dominance of Syria, where all the Middle Eastern trade routes converged.\n\nThe predecessors of Thutmose III had developed professional armed forces, but it was he who made them an effective instrument of conquest and defense. The pharaoh was the commander-in-chief of all the armies of Egypt, although he could cede functions to his crown prince.\n\nVarious inscriptions highlight that his son, the future Amenhotep II, learned to use weapons from his childhood and, already as a sovereign, demonstrated his skill in handling chariots and bows, both on training grounds and on the battlefield. But what was the armed wing of Egypt like and how did it work?\n\nInfantrymen, ships and chariots\n\nBelow the king, it was the vizier, as the administrative head of the country, who gave the instructions to the officers of the two military regions with capital in Memphis and Thebes, cities that had large barracks. The main sections of the army were the infantry, the river fleet, and the chariots.\n\nAs for the war chariots, the basic unit was a squad made up of 50 vehicles, which were divided into detachments of five or ten carriages.\n\nThe basic infantry and fleet unit was a company of between 200 and 250 soldiers, under the command of a standard bearer. These units could be divided into detachments of 50 men.\n\nSeveral companies of infantry formed a battalion, at the head of which was a commander, and several battalions constituted a large unit, led by a general.\n\nThe soldiers, who mostly came from the center and south of the country or from Nubia, had their bodies hardened by fighting practices and were used to making long marches to reach their objective.\n\nDuring the Megiddo campaign \u2013 in which the king took this fortress, where Mitanni\u2019s allies had gathered \u2013 the army covered the 220 kilometers that separated the border square of Tjaru and Gaza City in ten days.\n\nEach company in the fleet was attached to a ship. These ships, which were used to transport soldiers and supplies, received names such as La vaca bellicosa, El novillo or Amado de Amun.\n\nMilitary expeditions against Nubian territory were carried out with ships of the river fleet that crossed the Nile. But ships could also be sent to the coasts of the Near East.\n\nDuring the sixth Asian campaign, which concluded with the successful capture of the city of Qadesh, an ally of Mitanni, an Egyptian squadron sailed to the ports of the Canaanite coast, in an amphibious action that allowed the conquest of various enemy territories.\n\nAnd in the eighth campaign, in which Egyptians and Mitannians clashed directly, an army column traveled the more than 400 kilometers that separate the port of Byblos and the Euphrates bank transporting dismounted barges on ox-drawn carts.\n\nOnce the objective was reached, they assembled the boats and crossed the river to the amazement of the Mitannians. In fact, the importance that Thutmose III gave to navigation materialized with the construction of port facilities in the eastern delta, known as Peru Nefer, \u201cGood Voyage\u201d, which facilitated commercial and military communications with Canaanite coastal towns.\n\nThutmose III left his mark on the temple of Amun at Karnak and he raised an obelisk (today in Rome).\n\nThe difficult military campaigns\n\nMilitary operations were designed with the weather in mind. Except in emergencies, campaigns against African enemies were carried out in winter and expeditions against Asian territories were prepared for summer.\n\nIn this way the ancient Egyptians avoided the harshest heat and cold, which could become fatal enemies.\n\nIn campaign, the movements were ordered by means of drums and trumpets. The weight of the battle was carried by the infantry, in which two types were distinguished: the heavy, whose components were armed with shield, spear and ax, and the light, provided with javelins or bows and arrows.\n\nThere were also slingers. As for the war chariots, they were used mainly to escort the infantry in the open field, harass the enemy when they formed for battle and, if they were defeated, pursue them in their retreat..\n\nEach chariot had one or two side quivers where javelins, bows and arrows were kept. The cars were manned by two men: the driver, an expert in handling reins and weapons, and the combatant, who was in charge of protecting his partner.\n\nFor his part, the driver had to take responsibility for feeding the horses and keeping the vehicle in good condition.\n\nWhen it came to taking a walled city, the Egyptians could storm it with ladders and battering rams while archers fired at the defenders, or they could besiege it.\n\nIn the latter case, they cut down trees and built forts that would prevent contact between the besieged and the outside.\n\nThis system is described in the chronicles of the Battle of Megiddo, which surrendered after a seven-month encirclement by the troops of Thutmose III.\n\nRepeated rebellion could have tragic consequences for the defeated. Thutmose III\u2019s son and successor, Amenhotep II, personally executed seven Asian leaders and returned to Egypt with their corpses hanging on the ships of the fleet to display on the walls of Thebes and Napata.\n\nExcellent soldiers participated in these campaigns. Among the most successful of the time is General Djehuty, the first governor of the Asian lands, to whom later literature attributed the conquest of the city of Joppa \u201cThe Taking of Joppa\u201d by means of men hidden in baskets that were introduced into the fortress.\n\nIt is also worth remembering Commander Amenemhab, who accompanied the king on different expeditions and who was promoted and rewarded several times due to his heroic behavior, which was not limited to the battlefield: on one occasion he cut the trunk of an enraged pachyderm that charged against Thutmose III while the king hunted elephants.\n\nSoldier of ancient Egypt\n\nThe troops consisted of professional Egyptian soldiers, whose relatives resided in military colonies. When they left active service, they could continue to enjoy the fiscal advantages of those colonies, as long as one of their sons replaced them in the fulfillment of their military duty.\n\nTo avoid fraud, periodic inspections were carried out. The military barracks regularly received bread, beef, vegetables and beer. When they marched against the enemy, they were given the rations calculated by the scribes and provisions delivered by the leaders of the territories they passed through.\n\nThe scribes, in addition to the quartermaster, were in charge of recruiting. Military life was not without its attractions: in addition to the maintenance and usufruct of state lands, soldiers could seize the spoils of the vanquished and slaves, and were rewarded with honorary titles, promotions in rank and a generic decoration: the \u201chonor gold\u201d, materialized in gifts from the pharaoh that included weapons and gold and silver jewelry.\n\nSource: National Geographic\n\nEgyptian temple of Esna reveals unknown constellations names (amazing photos)"}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/empires/egypt/newkingdom/tuthmosis3.html", "page_content": "\n\nClick on the image for a gallery view Forced to wait more than 20 years to become pharaoh, Tuthmosis (reigned c1458 - 1425 BC) was a man in a hurry when he finally took power. His military victories made Egypt one of the richest countries on Earth.\n\n\n\nWhen his father died, Tuthmosis was just a young boy. His stepmother, Hatshepsut, was regent until he grew older, but then seized the throne and ruled as pharaoh herself in his place. Tuthmosis was denied his throne until Hatshepsut died, more than 20 years later.\n\n\n\nOpportunity knocks\n\n\n\nEgypt was powerful, but it still had many enemies. The death of a pharaoh presented them with a perfect opportunity to test the strength of the new leader. A coalition of foreign princes gathered in the city of Megiddo, threatening Egyptian trade and influence in the area.\n\n\n\nPerhaps they thought that Tuthmosis would be weak or hesitant: if so, they were seriously wrong. Having waited so long for power, Tuthmosis had big plans. He had been head of the army before he took the throne and knew that military victory was the best way to popular acclaim and immortality.\n\n\n\nPlanning ahead\n\n\n\nHe didn't just want to defend Egypt against its enemies; he wanted their lands for himself. He enlisted 20,000 soldiers - either voluntarily or by force - and trained them for an attack on Megiddo.\n\n\n\nThe army marched across the Sinai desert and up the Mediterranean coastline. Along the way, a team of scribes - the world's first war correspondents - recorded the army's progress and victories, and gave an idea of life in the pharaoh's army .\n\n\n\nClick on the image for a gallery view Surprise attack\n\n\n\nWhen the army arrived at Megiddo, Tuthmosis had to figure out his plan of attack. Against the advice of his generals, he decided to take the most direct - and most dangerous - route to the city, figuring that the enemy would not expect him to be so bold.\n\n\n\nHe was right. His attack surprised the enemy army, which was camped outside Megiddo, and he quickly defeated them.\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\nTuthmosis lost momentum, however, when his army stopped to plunder the enemy camp. This allowed the survivors to escape and hide behind the walls of the city. Now he had to sit it out. For seven months, Tuthmosis and his army kept the city under siege while raiding the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n\nWith its population starving, Megiddo finally surrendered. The city and its people now belonged to Tuthmosis, along with all its wealth. The war booty that Tuthmosis brought back to Thebes made it one of the richest and greatest cities in the Ancient World.\n\n\n\nBringing up baby\n\n\n\nTuthmosis also had the clever idea of bringing back the children of his defeated enemies. As they grew up, they were sent back to replace their fathers as part-Egyptians, not enemies, cementing Egyptian rule.\n\n\n\nIn the important gold-producing region of Nubia, originally conquered by Ahmose, Tuthmosis went one step further to secure control. He appointed a viceroy to rule over the area. The viceroy - the \"Overseer of the Gold Countries\" - ensured that Nubia's gold poured into Thebes giving Egypt all the gold it needed to rule its new empire. Map of Egypt at the end of Tuthmosis III reign\n\n\n\nWhat did he achieve?\n\n\n\nJust 100 years earlier, Egypt had been on the verge of extinction. Tuthmosis changed all that. He conquered more land than any pharaoh before or after. By the end of his reign, Egypt controlled Nubia, the Syrian and Lebanese coasts and vast areas of Israel and Palestine.

Megiddo, however, is mentioned at least 12 times in the Hebrew scriptures (the Christian Old Testament) concerning a number of military conflicts between the Israelites and various opponents.\n\nAerial View of Megiddo Photo Gallery Israeli Ministry of Tourism (CC BY-ND) Long before the Hebrew scribes wrote of these battles, however, Megiddo was already famous for an engagement involving a coalition of kings from Canaan and Syria in rebellion against the pharaoh Thutmose III (1458-1425 BCE) of Egypt. Thutmose III was one of the greatest military strategists of ancient Egypt who expanded the country's borders to establish the Egyptian Empire and elevated his nation to the status of a superpower. Although the regions which became Egyptian provinces prospered under this arrangement, they still looked for opportunities to assert their independence and regain their autonomy.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe Egyptian empire was initiated by Ahmose I (c.1570-1544 BCE) whose victory over the Hyksos of Lower Egypt marks the beginning of the period known as the New Kingdom of Egypt (c. 1570 - c. 1069 BCE), and every pharaoh who succeeded him maintained or enlarged the boundaries. Thutmose III, however, would go further than any others. In 20 years, he led 17 successful military campaigns, recorded on the walls of the Temple of Amun at Karnak but the most detailed account is of his first, and most famous, at Megiddo.\n\nBackground to the Battle\n\nThutmose III was the son and successor of Thutmose II (1492-1479 BCE), but when his father died, he was only three years old and so his step-mother, Hatshepsut (1479-1458 BCE), held the throne as regent. Soon after assuming this position, however, Hatshepsut broke with tradition and assumed power. Thutmose III spent his youth at the court of Thebes, in military training, and pursuing the kind of education expected for a prince of the New Kingdom.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nAfter her first few years as pharaoh, Hatshepsut organized no major military campaigns but kept her forces at peak efficiency and, when he proved able, promoted Thutmose III to commander of her forces. She was one of the most powerful, resourceful, and efficient monarchs in Egypt's history and, when she died, left Thutmose III a prosperous country with a well-organized and highly-trained fighting force.\n\nThutmose III Tjflex2 (CC BY-NC-ND)\n\nHatshepsut had maintained the empire steadily throughout her reign, but when she died, the kings of Megiddo and Kadesh rebelled against her successor whom they seem to have believed was weak. It was actually fairly common in the ancient world for subject states to rise against a new ruler in order to take advantage of the transition of power to win their independence. It is possible, in fact, that Hatshepsut anticipated this in that there seems to be some evidence that Thutmose III's first campaign had been commissioned by her; this claim is disputed, however. The coalition between the Canaanites of Megiddo and the Syrians of Kadesh attracted others dissatisfied with Egyptian rule, who gathered their forces outside the city of Megiddo in late 1458 or early 1457 BCE.\n\nLove History?

The army covered 150 miles in 10 days and rested at Gaza before moving on to the town of Yehem where Thutmose III halted to confer with his senior staff. There were three roads they could take from the nearby town of Aruna to reach Megiddo: a narrow pass which would require the army to march in single file and two other broader roads which would enable faster and easier movement. The generals claimed they had intelligence that the enemy was waiting for them at the end of the narrow pass and, further, progress would be slow and difficult with the vanguard reaching the battle site while the rearguard was still on the march.\n\nThutmose III listened to their council but disagreed with their points. According to the record of the engagement kept by his military scribe Tjaneni, Thutmose III addressed his commanders, saying:\n\nI swear, as Ra loves me, as my father Amun favors me, as my nostrils are rejuvenated with life and satisfaction, my majesty shall proceed upon this Aruna road! Let him of you who wishes go upon these roads of which you speak and let him of you who wishes come in the following of my majesty! 'Behold', they will say, these enemies whom Ra abominates, 'has his majesty set out on another road because he has become afraid of us?' \u2013 So they will speak. (Pritchard, 177)\n\nThe generals instantly bowed to his decision and then Thutmose III addressed his army. He encouraged them to march swiftly on the narrow road and assured them that he, himself, would lead from the front, saying \"I will not let my victorious army go forth ahead of my majesty in this place!\" (Pritchard, 177). The chariots and wagons were dismantled and carried and the men led the horses single-file through the pass to emerge in the Qina Valley by Megiddo.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nMegiddo albedo20 (CC BY-NC-ND)\n\nThey found no enemy waiting for them, and in fact, the coalition had assumed that Thutmose III would choose either of the easier routes and had troops prepared to defend at both locations. Thutmose III's decision to choose the more difficult path gave him the advantage of the element of surprise. He could not attack at once, however, since the better part of his army was still strung along the Aruna pass. It would take the rearguard over seven hours of marching to catch up with their king.\n\nThutmose III ordered the troops to rest and refresh themselves near the Qina Brook. Throughout the night, he personally received sentry reports and gave orders for the provisioning of the troops and their placement in battle for the following day. He positioned his army so that the southern wing was on a hill above the Qina Brook and the northern wing was on a rise to the northwest of Megiddo; the king would personally command the attack and lead from the center. Tjaneni's account reads:\n\nHis majesty set forth in a chariot of fine gold, adorned with his accoutrements of combat, like Horus, the Mighty of Arm, a lord of action like Montu, the Theban, while his father Amun made strong his arms\u2026Thereupon his majesty prevailed over them at the head of his army. Then they [the enemy] saw his majesty prevailing over them and they fled headlong to Megiddo with their faces of fear. They abandoned their horses and their chariots of gold and silver so that someone might draw them up into this town by hoisting on their garments. Now the people had shut this town against them but they let down garments to hoist them up into this town. (Pritchard, 179)\n\nTjaneni's report notes how, if the army had pursued the fleeing enemy across the field and cut them down in their flight, then the battle would have ended decisively that day. Instead, the soldiers \"gave up their hearts to capturing the possessions of the enemy\" on the field and allowed their opponents to not only reach the sanctuary of the city but mount defenses (Pritchard, 179). Thutmose III ordered a moat dug around Megiddo and a stockade built around the moat. No one from inside the city was allowed out except to surrender or if called to parley by an Egyptian officer.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe siege lasted at least seven, possibly eight, months before the leaders of the coalition surrendered the city. Thutmose III offered very generous terms, which amounted to a promise from his opponents that they would not raise another rebellion against Egypt; none of the ringleaders were executed and the city was left untouched. Thutmose III did strip the ringleaders of their positions and appointed new officials, loyal to Egypt, in their place. He also took their children as hostages back to Egypt to guarantee their good behavior. Although this may sound harsh, the hostages were well cared for and continued to live at the level of comfort they were used to. The children were educated in Egyptian culture and, when they came of age, were sent back to their lands with an appreciation for and loyalty to the Egyptian pharaoh.\n\nSignificance of the Battle\n\nThe list of loot carried back to Egypt from the campaign, including prisoners of war, slaves, hostages, arms and armor, gold and silver chariots, jewels and precious metals, and livestock, would have been enough to mark it an overwhelming triumph. In addition to putting down the rebellion and enriching Egypt's treasury, however, the victory also gave Thutmose III control over northern Canaan and provided him with a base from which to launch campaigns into Mesopotamia. The great princes of the Mesopotamian cities which had not joined the coalition sent tribute to Egypt of their own accord to win favor with \u2013 and hopefully buy protection from - the great warrior-king and champion of The Battle of Megiddo, and his fame became legendary quite quickly.\n\nThutmose III's triumph over the coalition at Megiddo established his reputation early & assured the success of all his future campaigns.\n\nIn the following years, he would conquer Syria and the lands of the Mitanni \u2013 both of whom had been involved in the Megiddo uprising - before turning his attention to the southern borders of Egypt to defeat the Nubians and expand Egypt's holdings in that region. As at Megiddo, he always relied on the element of surprise and was never deterred by the difficulties or obstacles to victory. His triumph over the coalition at Megiddo established his reputation early and assured that the success of all his future campaigns was all but certain as the enemy would know in advance they were facing an invincible opponent.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe battle most likely suggested itself to the writer of Revelation in that the description of the forces of Satan and God in the biblical narrative are similar to those of the coalition and of Thutmose III's army in the official inscription of Tjaneni at Karnak. In both, the writers describe the victorious forces of good over the assembled coalition of evil. There can be little doubt that the scribe who wrote the biblical work was acquainted with The Battle of Megiddo since the story of Thutmose III's great victory against the combined forces of his enemies remained well known for centuries afterwards."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistory.org/Thutmose_III/", "page_content": "Thutmose III (also known as Tuthmosis III, r. 1458-1425 BCE) was the 6th king of Egypt's 18th Dynasty, one of the greatest military leaders in antiquity, and among the most effective and impressive monarchs in Egypt's history. His throne name, Thutmose, means 'Thoth is Born', while his birth name, Menkhperre, means 'Eternal are the Manifestations of Ra'.\n\nBoth of these throne names reference important deities of ancient Egypt Thoth, the god of writing and wisdom, and Ra, the supreme god of the sun. Thutmose III was the son of Thutmose II and a lesser wife named Iset. Thutmose II (r. 1492-1479 BCE) was married to Queen Hatshepsut (r. 1479-1458 BCE), royal daughter of Thutmose I (r. 1520-1492 BCE) and a powerful woman who held the position of God's Wife of Amun.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nWhen Thutmose II died, Hatshepsut became regent of Egypt since Thutmose III was too young to rule. She was supposed to maintain this position but, instead, declared herself pharaoh and ruled independently. Thutmose III, when he came of age and proved himself able, was given command of the armed forces by his step-mother; a choice she would not regret as he proved himself an exceptional military strategist and charismatic leader. He is often referred to in the present day as 'the Napoleon of Egypt', but unlike Napoleon, Thutmose III never lost a single engagement, expanded and maintained his empire, and was worshiped by his people for centuries after his death.\n\nYouth Under Hatshepsut & Rise to Power\n\nThutmose III was born c. 1481 BCE and was only three years old when his father died and Hatshepsut was made regent and then reigning monarch. He grew up at the royal court of Thebes, capital of Egypt throughout most of the period of the New Kingdom (c. 1570 - c. 1069 BCE). Although there is little documentation of his life during this time, a great emphasis was placed on the physical and intellectual development of princes during the New Kingdom of Egypt as they were expected to one day rule over an expanding empire.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThutmose III, therefore, would have spent a great deal of time in school, at athletics, and learning about military tactics and strategies. He probably went along on the early campaigns Hatshepsut commissioned as this was a common practice among New Kingdom pharaohs to acquaint their successors with warfare at an early age. During this time, Thutmose III developed skills in archery, horsemanship, hand-to-hand combat, and athletic ability. There is no doubt that military training was his priority but his education went far beyond battle tactics and the use of weapons; his later reign makes clear he was a highly cultured and sophisticated man who was aware of the value of cultures beyond Egypt's borders, recognized the importance of art and music, and had a great respect for human life.\n\nStatue of King Thutmose III Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin (Copyright)\n\nWhile he was growing up, his step-mother was reigning over one of the most prosperous periods in Egypt's history. After the initial campaigns to secure her position, there were no others throughout Hatshepsut's reign and the army was only deployed in small troops to protect trade expeditions and to maintain the borders. Hatshepsut did not allow her military to stand idle, however, or weaken as evidenced by how quickly Thutmose III was able to mobilize and lead the armies once he came to power.\n\nLove History? Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter!\n\nHatshepsut may have married her daughter Neferu-Ra to Thutmose III in order to secure succession but it does not seem, after his youth, that he spent much time at court. Orientalist James Henry Breasted has suggested he would have probably lived among the soldiers from a fairly early age in order to stay out of Hatshepsut's way and prove himself useful to her reign. It was common enough for noble princes to be removed at the discretion of a reigning monarch who perceived them as a threat and Thutmose III shows too great an ambition to have made himself so vulnerable.\n\nThat he succeeded in his plans is evidenced by the fact that, before the end of her reign, Hatshepsut had placed him in command of her armies. Her reign ended with her death in 1458 BCE, and Thutmose III came to the throne. Hatshepsut had maintained a tight control of Egypt's borders and provinces, but with her death, the kings of Egyptian-controlled states in Canaan and Syria rebelled. Thutmose III was not interested in negotiation and certainly was not going to let these provinces simply leave the empire, and so he set out on his first military campaign.\n\nMilitary Campaigns\n\nIn his time as pharaoh, Thutmose III would lead 17 successful military campaigns in 20 years. He ordered the details of his victories to be inscribed at the Temple of Amun at Karnak and they are considered the most extensive records of ancient Egyptian military campaigns extant. His first is his most famous \u2013 The Battle of Megiddo \u2013 and is the one described in the most exacting narrative. His later campaigns lose this form and are given with less detail, appearing more as lists of spoils than narratives of the king's victories.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nIn his time as pharaoh, Thutmose III would lead 17 successful military campaigns in 20 years.\n\nThe reason for the decline in narrative form is not clear, but the claim of some scholars that it indicates a stronger cohesion of the state in which pragmatic lists of goods superseded narratives of a pharaoh's victory is untenable; there are a number of such narratives in the centuries following Thutmose III's reign, most notably that of Ramesses II (r. 1279-1213 BCE) concerning Kadesh and Ramesses III (r. 1186-1155 BCE) regarding his victory over the Sea Peoples. The most reasonable explanation for the brevity of the later inscriptions is simply that the writer of the Megiddo narrative died.\n\nThe story of the Battle of Megiddo was written by Thutmose III's private secretary, military scribe, and general Tjaneni (also given as Thanuny, c. 1455 BCE) who was with him throughout the event. Tjaneni kept a journal on a leather scroll (later deposited for posterity at the Temple of Amun in Thebes) which Thutmose III so admired he ordered the narrative inscribed on the walls of the temple as well as those of others throughout Egypt.\n\nTjaneni provides a detailed description of Thutmose III as a commander-in-chief fully aware of his abilities and those of his troops and completely confident of victory. In the most famous passage of the account, the pharaoh calls a conference with his senior staff to discuss marching orders to Megiddo and tells them they will be taking the narrow road from Aruna, on which the army will have to march single-file, rather than either of the wider and more easily travelled roads which were available.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nThe generals object to this, arguing that they have intelligence the enemy is waiting for them at the pass to the plains of Megiddo from the Aruna road and their rearguard will still be marching while the vanguard is engaged with the enemy. Thutmose III hears their counsel but disagrees, telling them that they may take whatever road they choose but he will be leading his army along the Aruna road and will be leading from the front. The generals then agree to follow wherever he chooses to take them.\n\nHis decision on the Aruna road was characteristic of Thutmose III's resolve to pursue a course he considered best regardless of the difficulties. The armies would have had an easier time on the other roads \u2013 especially considering that, on the Aruna path, they had to dismantle and carry the chariots and supply wagons \u2013 but it would have cost the army the element of surprise which Thutmose III recognized as imperative.\n\nTemple of Karnak, Wars of Thutmose III Michael Lusk (CC BY-NC-SA)\n\nAs it turned out, the enemy was not waiting at the end of the Aruna road but on the two easier paths which they expected Thutmose III to take at the head of so large an army. No one expected him to lead his forces along what was essentially a cattle path. After giving his army a night to rest and refresh themselves, he ordered the attack the next morning, leading from the front, and drove his opponents from the field. The report then details how his army, delighted at the victory, gathered treasures from the fallen instead of pursuing survivors and taking the city. This cost Thutmose III complete victory on the field that day because it gave the people of Megiddo time to prepare their defenses.\n\nRemove Ads Advertisement\n\nEven so, Thutmose III marched on the city, surrounded it with a moat and a stockade, and lay siege to it for seven or eight months until it surrendered. He offered very generous terms to the people \u2013 none of the surviving ringleaders of the revolt were executed \u2013 which essentially came down to a promise not to incite rebellion in the future. He then turned his army around and marched back home with his enormous loot from the campaign, pausing only to harvest the crops of the defeated and bring them back to Egypt.\n\nAt Megiddo, he also initiated a policy he would adhere to throughout all his campaigns of bringing the noble children of the defeated kings back to Egypt to be educated as Egyptians. These children were held as hostages to guarantee the good behavior of their parents but were treated with all the respect due to royalty, housed in the palace, and given many freedoms. When they came of age, they were allowed to return home where, since they had now spent their youth in Egypt, they supported and encouraged Egyptian culture and the state's interests when they were elevated to positions of power.\n\nThutmose III's victory at Megiddo gave him control of northern Canaan from which he would launch his campaign into Syria to take Kadesh. He campaigned against the Mitanni and erected a stele at the Euphrates River, commemorated in his inscription at Karnak, known as Thutmose III's Hymn of Victory. His Nubian campaigns were equally successful, and by his 50th year, he had expanded Egypt's holdings beyond any of his predecessors and made the country wealthier than it had been since the beginning of the 4th Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt (c. 2613- 2181 BCE).\n\nPatron of the Arts\n\nHis reign was not only focused on military conquest, however, as his patronage of the arts shows. Thutmose III commissioned upwards of 50 temples, numerous tombs, monuments, and contributed more significantly to the Temple of Amun at Karnak than any other pharaoh. His renovations and additions to the Karnak temple, in fact, are among the most significant in that they preserve the names of past kings (whose monuments he would sometimes remove in his renovations) and provide narratives of his own campaigns and initiatives which have proven to be extremely important to scholars in the study of the culture.\n\nTemple of Amun, Karnak Dennis Jarvis (CC BY-SA)\n\nArtistic techniques and experimentation reached new heights under Thutmose III. Glass-making had been known for centuries but was now perfected to the point where drinking vessels could be made of glass. Statuary was less idealized and more realistic \u2013 a trend begun in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2040-1782 BCE) \u2013 but abandoned in favor of the traditional idealism in art established during the Old Kingdom. Thutmose III is depicted in his statuary as a tall, handsome man in excellent physical condition and this is considered a realistic portrayal in that, first, all depictions are uniform and, second, depictions of others \u2013 also consistent \u2013 are far from flattering.\n\nHis artisans produced some of the finest work in Egypt's history including elaborate tombs decorated with intricate paintings and freestanding columns as well as contributing enormous pylons to Karnak. In keeping with Egypt's respect for and love of nature, he encouraged public parks and gardens, created lakes and ponds for the people's recreation and enjoyment, and had a private garden cultivated both around his palace and at Karnak temple.\n\nDefacement of Hatshepsut's Monuments\n\nHis artistic sensibilities and respect for others are at odds with a policy almost universally ascribed to him: the desecration of Hatshepsut's monuments and the attempt to erase her name from history. Scholars are divided on when this happened in his reign but it was certainly not in the early years. Whenever it transpired, the name and images of Hatshepsut were removed from all public monuments as well as the exterior and some of the interior work at her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri.\n\nTo remove a person's name was to condemn them to non-existence; one needed to be remembered in order to continue one's eternal journey in the afterlife. Further, it was thought that the deceased needed daily sustenance in the form of food and drink offerings delivered to their tombs, where their body was preserved through mummification and statues representing them enabled their soul to visit and partake of these offerings. The so-called Execration Texts of ancient Egypt make clear that the removal of one's name was only justified if that person had committed some serious offense, but there is no evidence of Hatshepsut being involved with any such crimes.\n\nTemple of Hatshepsut, Aerial View N/A (CC BY)\n\nMost likely, Thutmose III ordered this action to prevent Hatshepsut from standing as a role model for future women who might aspire to rule. The position of the monarch of Egypt was traditionally occupied by males and, by assuming power for herself, Hatshepsut had departed from this practice. The first king of Egypt was thought to have been the god Osiris who was murdered by his brother Set and brought back to life by his sister-wife Isis. He was finally succeeded by his son Horus who defeated Set, took back the throne, and re-established order in the land. Kings associated themselves with Horus during their reign and with Osiris, who became Lord of the Dead, in the afterlife; there was no place in this narrative for a woman to hold supreme power.\n\nThe central cultural value of ancient Egypt was ma'at (harmony and balance) and this relied largely on an adherence to tradition. Ancient Egyptians are often characterized as conservative for this reason: departure from tradition could result in a loss of stability \u2013 balance \u2013 and the return of primordial chaos. It was the duty of the pharaoh to maintain ma'at and this is probably the motivation behind Thutmose III's eradication of Hatshepsut's name.\n\nHe backdated his reign to remove all evidence of her ever having ruled Egypt and replaced some of her images in her mortuary temple with his own. All of her public monuments were torn down \u2013 especially those at Karnak \u2013 and replaced by his, though, at other sites, only her name was removed. So thorough was this erasure of his predecessor that Hatshepsut's name was unknown in Egypt's history until the 19th century CE. Later kings of Egypt thought the beautiful Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri was built by Thutmose III, and many of them would claim her impressive monuments as their own.\n\nThutmose III essentially created the Egyptian empire single-handedly.\n\nIt has been suggested that Thutmose III had nothing to do with these actions and that they were perpetrated by his son and successor Amenhotep II (r. 1425-1400 BCE) either in the latter part of Thutmose III's reign or the beginning of his own. Although this is possible, it does not seem probable in that, by the time of Amenhotep II, Thutmose III had already ordered Hatshepsut's works at Karnak removed and replaced by his own. Further, the image and name of Hatshepsut was left intact within the interior of her mortuary temple.\n\nIf Amenhotep II, who never knew Hatshepsut, was trying to erase her from history, it is unlikely he would have spared her memory anywhere. Leaving her name and image intact, but out of the public eye, suggests that Thutmose III was only interested in maintaining the tradition of a male pharaoh in Egypt's history but did not wish his step-mother any ill will.\n\nWhen he died, of natural causes, in c. 1425 BCE, he was buried in his own mortuary temple beside that of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri. Even though he had basically claimed her temple as his own, he still would not have had his eternal resting place located so close to hers if he had sincerely believed she deserved to be sentenced to non-existence.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe unfortunate result of this action is that, ever since the rediscovery of Hatshepsut, Thutmose III is as often referenced for her eradication as he is for his many accomplishments and magnificent reign. Thutmose III essentially created the Egyptian empire single-handedly. He elevated Egypt's status as a powerful and prosperous nation, employed the people in monumental building projects, and epitomized the ideal of the valiant Egyptian warrior-king who led his forces to successive victories.\n\nThutmose III's consideration for his enemies in defeat and gentle treatment of them made him respected far beyond the boundaries of his country. He established an empire stretching from the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia, through Syria and the Levant, down through Nubia to the Fifth Cataract of the Nile.\n\nAlthough there is little doubt that the people of these lands would have preferred their independence, they prospered under his reign through the peace he established and maintained through his military and diplomatic skills. In every respect, Thutmose III represented the ideal pharaoh to his people and his memory has endured to the present day as one of the greatest kings of ancient Egypt."}, {"url": "https://www.worldhistoryedu.com/thutmose-iii-history-military-campaigns-greatest-achievements/", "page_content": "Thutmose III, one of ancient Egypt\u2019s greatest rulers, was the 6th pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty.

Arguably Egypt\u2019s greatest warrior king, Thutmose III built upon the laurels and works of predecessors like his stepmother Hatshepsut and his father Thutmose II.\n\nWith a total of 17 military campaigns, this powerful king was able to stretch the boundaries of Egypt, turning Egypt into the most dominant power in the region. It is generally accepted among Egyptologists and scholars alike that Egypt reached its pinnacle during the reign of Thutmose III. What were some of his most famous military campaigns?

Following the death of his father in 1479 BC, he was the most eligible person to rise to throne. However, he was only just child at the time. Hence his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut ruled on his behalf as regent of Egypt.\n\nGrowing up, the young boy-king received the best of education befitting of an Egyptian monarch. Thutmose III also received training in military tactics, horse and chariot riding, archery, and among others. Right from an early age, he had a knack for horsemanship, as he was very well built and a good marksman.\n\nNames and epithets\n\nAs it was common for ancient Egyptian kings and queens, Thutmose III went by a number of names and epithets. His two main names were associated with major Egyptian gods Ra and Thoth. For example his name Tuthmosis or Thutmose evokes the meaning of \u201cThoth is born\u201d or \u201cBorn of Thoth\u201d. The god Thoth was the Egyptian deity of the moon, time, and wisdom.\u2019\n\nThutmose III\u2019s other name mn-\u1e2bpr-r\u02c1 \u1e0f\u1e25wty-ms means \u201cLasting is the Manifestation of Ra\u201d or \u201cThe Lasting One of the Manifestation of Ra\u201d. Egyptians believed that the sun god Ra, also known as the chief of the Egyptian pantheon, steered his sun barge through the sky bringing sunlight to land.\n\nThutmose II \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s father\n\nThutmose II was the father of Thutmose III. Born to Pharaoh Thutmose I and Queen Mutnofret, Thutmose II was the fourth pharaoh of the 18th Dynasty of Egypt. His reign is said to have started in 1493 and ended upon his death in 1479. During his reign he achieved a number of things, including quelling revolts in the Levant and Nubia.\n\nIn addition to Iset, Thutmose III\u2019s mother, Thutmose II had a number of consorts. Upon his death in 1479, Thutmose II\u2019s chief consort Queen Hatshepsut succeeded him to the throne.\n\nQueen Iset \u2013 Thutmose III\u2019s mother\n\nWith Hatshepsut taking the role as the Great Royal Wife of Thutmose II, Queen Iset was the secondary wife of Thutmose II. Iset\u2019s name was derived from the name of the ancient Egyptian mother goddess Isis. In some ancient texts and inscriptions, Iset is referred to as the chief consort of Thutmose II. Thutmose III\u2019s mother\u2019s name appears on his mummy wrappings as well as a statue of the king in the Karnak Temple Complex. Upon her son\u2019s coronation as the sole ruler of Egypt in 1458 BC (i.e. after the death of Queen Hatshepsut), Iset received the epithet \u201cKing\u2019s Mother\u201d.\n\nA number of Iset\u2019s images and depictions can be found in the tomb of Thutmose III at the Valley of the Kings. Many of those depictions see her revered as the manifestation of the Egyptian goddess Isis. In one depiction, she can be seen standing behind Thutmose III on a boat.\n\nQueen Hatshepsut\u2019s regency, co-regency and ultimate rule\n\nFollowing the death of Thutmose II around 1479 BC, the Great Royal Wife Hatshepsut became regent Thutmose II\u2019s only son Thutmose III, who was too young to reign as king. Even long before the death of Thutmose II, Hatshepsut\u2019s power in the kingdom was quite immense, with some describing her as the real power behind Thutmose II\u2019s reign. Thutmose II, a lesser son of Thutmose I, had to marry Hatshepsut in order to consolidate his power.\n\nAbout seven years into her regency, Hatshepsut will go from regent of Egypt to co-ruler of the kingdom until her death in 1458 BC. She thus co-ruled with her stepson Thutmose III. Upon her death, Thutmose III became the sole ruler of Egypt.\n\nHatshepsut assigned herself full titles of a pharaoh. She donned clothes similar to the ones Egyptian pharaohs wore. Bent on dominating the affairs of land of Egypt, she also assumed the insignia of the Egyptian pharaoh. Effectively ruling as pharaoh from c. 1479 to 1458 BC, Hatshepsut, who was also known as \u201cForemost of Noble Ladies\u201d, steered Egypt to great heights.\n\nRead More: 10 Greatest Accomplishments of Queen Hatshepsut\n\nThutmose III and Hatshepsut\n\nUpon attaining the age of maturity, Queen Hatshepsut appointed Thutmose III as the commander of her army. Egyptologists note that Thutmose III served as the co-ruler of Egypt throughout the reign of Hatshepsut. There was hardly any grudge between the two as they worked in tandem. Both rulers had royal names and insignia.\n\nAs a matter of fact their different leadership traits complemented perfectly. Some scholars have noted that the co-rulership of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III proved extremely beneficial for the latter\u2019s sole reign over Egypt.\n\nMajor achievements of Thutmose III\n\nLike many 18th Dynasty pharaohs of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III benefited a lot from the technology transferred to Egypt during the reign of Hyksos rulers [Fifteenth Dynasty (c. 1650-1550 BC)]. Armed with military innovations like the horse and chariot, the sickle sword and the composite bow, Thutmose III embarked on many military campaigns and conquests. By so doing, he was able to wield tremendous influence in the region, from southern Syria and Canaan to the east to Nubia to the south. Ancient Egypt was truly a superpower during the reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III.\n\nDuring his reign from 1479 BC to 1425 BC, Thutmose III was able to accomplish a lot of outstanding things. Some of his major accomplishments are as follows:\n\nAncient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon\n\nEgyptologists often opine that there was hardly any ancient Egyptian ruler that could rival the expansionist ambitions of Thutmose III. It\u2019s been estimated that he spent more than twenty years of his thirty-year reign as Egypt\u2019s sole ruler campaigning in foreign lands. It is for this reason some historians like to refer to him as ancient Egypt\u2019s Napoleon.\n\nThutmose III embarked upon a total of 17 campaigns in foreign territories, capturing several hundreds of cities in the process. By the time he was through, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s influence and dominion to places as far as the Near East, Nubia in the south, and the Euphrates.\n\nAn astute commander of Egypt\u2019s army\n\nAs co-ruler and commander of Egypt\u2019s army, Thutmose III prepared himself adequately to reassert Egypt\u2019s influence in northern Syria, Nubia and Palestine. For many years since his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s conquest of those regions, Egypt\u2019s hold over those regions had gradually faded. During his father Thutmose II\u2019s reign, the tributes that Egypt received from those foreign rulers steadily fell.\n\nAnd the fact that Egypt was left with a boy-king following the death of Thutmose II in some way emboldened those foreign Syrian princes to rebel against Egypt\u2019s influence in the region. The task of bringing those regions back under Egypt\u2019s control fell squarely on Thutmose III. Realizing this, co-ruler Queen Hatshepsut was right in naming her stepson and co-ruler Thutmose III the commander-in-chief of Egypt\u2019s army.\n\nBy his mid-20s, he had grown into a fine warrior, knowledgeable in many military tactics and skilled at weapon handling. Thutmose was ready to begin his military campaigns in Syria and other surrounding regions in Mesopotamia.\n\nThutmose III led what was possible the mightiest and largest Egyptian army ever\n\nThutmose III\u2019s early introduction into the army proved extremely useful for him going forward. Steadily he went on to build a very large army that instilled a lot fear in Egypt\u2019s foreign enemies. Historians and Egyptologists like to believe that Thutmose\u2019s reign saw the Egyptian army reach its peak, boasting of the largest army in ancient Egypt\u2019s history.\n\nMarched his army to capture Megiddo\n\nIn what is widely recognized as Thutmose III\u2019s first campaign, the young Egyptian ruler led his army to halt the growing power of the king of Kadesh. Thutmose\u2019s army went through Jamnia before arriving at Megiddo.\n\nBefore facing off the king of Kadesh in the Battle of Megiddo, Thutmose is said to have made a very brave decision of taking the most challenging route to the battle ground. Contrary to the advice of his war counsel, the Egyptian king chose to take the riskiest path through a narrow mountain pass in the Wadi Ara (present-day in Israel). The path allowed Thutmose and his army to strategically place themselves between the rear side of the enemy forces and Megiddo. The battle, which was the biggest of all the 17 campaigns of Thutmose III, ended in a resounding victory for Thutmose. The Pharaoh laid siege to the city for about eight months before bringing Megiddo to its knees. As the troops made their way back to Egypt, they helped themselves to plundering much of the resources of Megiddo.\n\nWielded control over all of Canaan and large parts of Syria\n\nThe capture of Megiddo meant that Thutmose III had placed himself in firm control of all of Canaan and many other parts of Syria. In order to maintain that firm control of those places he ordered the payment of large annual tributes to Egypt. Those foreign lands were also required to send their princes and heirs to Egypt where they were Egyptionalized so to speak. By so doing, Egypt was able to secure strong loyalty from those princes once they turned to rulers of their respective cities.\n\nConquered Kadesh and other cities in Al-Biqa valley\n\nFurthermore, Thutmose conquered many ports on the Phoenician coast, allowing him to gain greater control of Syria. After plundering the town of Ardata, he turned the place into an important strategic base for Egypt. In his sixth campaign, the Egyptian king proceeded to take and pillage many Kadesh territories. As part of his effort to prevent those conquered territories from rebelling, he sometimes plundered a lot of their resources, thereby leaving them impoverished with no ability to mount a rebellion.\n\nBrought the state of Mitanni under Egypt\u2019s control\n\nBeginning around the end of Thutmose III\u2019s grandfather\u2019s reign, Thutmose I, the rulers of Mitanni, a Mesopotamian kingdom, had started to grow in power and influence in the region. Thutmose III was bent on clipping Mitanni\u2019s rise. In his 33rd year, he led his army on an eight campaign. After crossing the Euphrates River, he took on the Mitannian forces, who were anything but ready for an invasion. The king of Mitanni fled, allowing Thutmose III to force Mitanni into complete submission. The Egyptian king is said to have taking about more than 30 members of the Mitannian\u2019s harem and several hundreds of soldiers prisoners.\n\nTo commemorate his spectacular victory, he erected a stele next to his grandfather\u2019s stele in the region. Thutmose thus became the first Egyptian monarch since Thutmose I to cross the Euphrates.\n\nA prominent builder of spectacular buildings\n\nA great patron of the arts and architecture, Thutmose III is said to have tasked his architects to build many magnificent structures, most famous among them came at the Temple of Amun at Karnak. Thutmose is credited with enlarging the complex by erecting new buildings and obelisks. For example he rebuilt his grandfather Thutmose I\u2019s hypostyle hall. He also built a jubilee hall to mark his reign during the Sed festival. He also built a new temple at Dayr al-Bahri, just close to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple.\n\nMore Thutmose III facts\n\nAs a result of the immense influence he had, many foreign princes and monarchs, from the Hittite region to the Mesopotamian region, frequently presented him a wide array of gifts. Rulers from as far as the Aegean and the Greek mainland sent envoys and gifts to Thutmose III.\n\nMuch of what we know about Thutmose III comes from the records of Thanuny, a royal scribe and commander in Thutmose III\u2019s army.\n\nHe was a known hunter of elephant in the land of Niy in the Orontes Valley.\n\nOften times, the prisoners of war and the loot that he took from foreign lands were presented to the god Amun (Amon).\n\nAfter conquering a foreign land, Thutmose III would deploy native rulers to govern those territories. Those rulers were required to remain loyal, keep the peace, and pay annual tributes to Egypt. During his reign, Egypt received tributes from Nubia (Sudan), Syria, and Palestine.\n\nTypical of many Egyptian pharaohs, the records of Thutmose III are a bit boastful, exaggerating the abilities of the Egyptian king.\n\nIt was during Thutmose III\u2019s reign that Egyptian artisans mastered glass making.\n\nIn his final few years on the throne, some of his courtiers, along with his heir Amenhotep II, tried to erase the records, including images and cartouches, of Hatshepsut and her reign. In some cases, Hatshepsut\u2019s achievements were appropriated to Thutmose II and Thutmose I.\n\nHe loved to bring animals and plants from far and wide into his kingdom. Some of those foreign beasts and plants can be seen on the walls of the Festival Hall at Karnak.\n\nFor quite a number of centuries, Egyptians took to inscribing the name of Thutmose III on amulets. It was believed that those amulets protected the wearer.\n\nMummy and memorial temple\n\nThutmose III was buried in a very remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes.\n\nHis mummy was discovered in 1889. Archaeologists believe that the 21st dynasty priest-kings (1076- c. 945 BC) kept his mummy in that place in order to protect it from being desecrated.\n\nBased on his mummy, Thutmose III\u2019s height was in the region of five feet three inches (around 1.6 meters).\n\nDiscovered in 1962, Thutmose III\u2019s memorial temple was sited next to Hatshepsut\u2019s memorial temple in Dayr al-Bahri.\n\nMore Thutmose III achievements\n\nHis final military campaign saw him put down a rebellion (instigated by some exiled members of the Mitannian royal family) in the Arka plain. He also destroyed many Mitannian garrisons in the region.\n\nAround his 50th regnal year, he turned his attention to his southern borders, where he captured many Nubian territories, including Napata and Kurgus. He is famed for being the first Egyptian king to march an army as far as the fourth cataract of the Nile River.\n\nShortly after securing those Nubian regions, he erected a temple in honor of the god Amun. He also captured a number of prisoners that he would later send to the gold mines. Scholars state that the produce from those gold mines formed a significant portion of Egypt\u2019s wealth.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s consorts and children\n\nIn some texts it\u2019s noted that Thutmose III married his half-sister Neferure, who was the daughter of Thutmose II and Pharaoh-Queen Hatshepsut. Neferure was at some point was even referred to as the God\u2019s Wife.\n\nIn another account, the great royal wife of Thutmose III was rather Merytre-Hatshepsut. By her, Thutmose III gave birth to Amenhotep II, his successor. Merytre-Hatshepsut became the chief consort of the king after the death of Satiah. Additionally, Merytre-Hatshepsut was the mother of Thutmose\u2019s successor Amenhotep II. In the course of her life, Merytre-Hatshepsut had titles like Great King\u2019s Wife, God\u2019s Wife, King\u2019s Mother, Sole One, Beloved of Ra, and First among the nobles.\n\nOther famous wives of Thutmose III include Menwi, Merti, and Menhet. Those three women were princesses from foreign lands who were sent to the royal harem of the pharaoh. Although they were regarded as minor wives of the king, the three women still held a bit of influence in the royal court, receiving titles like King\u2019s Wife.\n\nThutmose III also had the likes of Nebtu, Nebsemi and Satiah in his royal harem. It\u2019s been stated that by later, Thutmose III bore his eldest son Prince Amenemhat. Satiah was psossibly Thutmose III\u2019s first Great Royal Wife.\n\nKing Thutmose III had many children, including Menkheperre, Nebetiunet, Merytamun C, Merytamun D, Iset, and Nefertiri.\n\nFamily Tree of Thutmose III\n\nSuccessor\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign spanned for about 54 years; the first twenty-two years of his reign was spent serving as the co-ruler of Egypt with his stepmother Queen Hatshepsut. In his final few years, he appointed his son and heir Amenhotep II as a junior co-regent.\n\nHis eldest son and heir, Amenemhat, predeceased him, possibly dying of a plague. Following the death of Amenemhat, Amenhotep II became heir to Thutmose III."}, {"url": "https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldhistory/chapter/the-new-kingdom/", "page_content": "Learning Objective Explain the reasons for the collapse of the New Kingdom\n\nKey Points The New Kingdom saw Egypt attempt to create a buffer against the Levant and by attaining its greatest territorial by extending into Nubia and the Near East.

Second Intermediate Period Spanning the Fourteenth to Seventeenth Dynasties, a period of Egyptian history where power was split between the Hyksos and a Theban-based dynasty in Upper Egypt.\n\nThe New Kingdom of Egypt, also referred to as the Egyptian Empire, is the period in ancient Egyptian history between 1550-1070 BCE, covering the Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth Dynasties of Egypt. The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period, and was succeeded by the Third Intermediate Period. It was Egypt\u2019s most prosperous time and marked the peak of its power.\n\nThe Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties (1292-1069 BCE) are also known as the Ramesside period, after the eleven pharaohs that took the name of Ramesses. The New Kingdom saw Egypt attempt to create a buffer against the Levant and attain its greatest territorial extent. This was possibly a result of the foreign rule of the Hyksos during the Second Intermediate Period.\n\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1543-1292 BCE)\n\nThe Eighteenth Dynasty, also known as the Thutmosid Dynasty, contained some of Egypt\u2019s most famous pharaohs, including Ahmose I, Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Amenhotep III, Akhenaten (c. 1353-1336 BCE) and his queen Nefertiti, and Tutankhamun. Queen Hatshepsut (c. 1479 \u2013 1458 BCE) concentrated on expanding Egypt\u2019s external trade by sending a commercial expedition to the land of Punt, and was the longest-reigning woman pharaoh of an indigenous dynasty. Thutmose III, who would become known as the greatest military pharoah, expanded Egypt\u2019s army and wielded it with great success to consolidate the empire created by his predecessors. These victories maximized Egyptian power and wealth during the reign of Amenhotep III. It was also during the reign of Thutmose III that the term \u201cpharaoh,\u201d originally referring to the king\u2019s palace, became a form of address for the king.\n\nOne of the best-known Eighteenth Dynasty pharaohs is Amenhotep IV (c. 1353-1336 BCE), who changed his name to Akhenaten in honor of Aten and whose exclusive worship of the deity is often interpreted as the first instance of monotheism. Under his reign Egyptian art flourished and attained an unprecedented level of realism. Toward the end of this dynasty, the Hittites had expanded their influence into Phoenicia and Canaan, the outcome of which would be inherited by the rulers of the Nineteenth Dynasty.\n\nThe Nineteenth Dynasty (c. 1292-1187 BCE)\n\nNew Kingdom Egypt would reach the height of its power under Seti I and Ramesses II, who fought against the Libyans and Hittites. The city of Kadesh was a flashpoint, captured first by Seti I and then used as a peace bargain with the Hatti, and later attacked again by Ramesses II. Eventually, the Egyptians and Hittites signed a lasting peace treaty.\n\nRamesses II had a large number of children, and he built a massive funerary complex for his sons in the Valley of the Kings. The Nineteenth Dynasty ended in a revolt led by Setnakhte, the founder of the Twentieth Dynasty.\n\nThe Twentieth Dynasty (c. 1187-1064 BCE)\n\nThe last \u201cgreat\u201d pharaoh from the New Kingdom is widely regarded to be Ramesses III. In the eighth year of his reign, the Sea Peoples invaded Egypt by land and sea, but were defeated by Ramesses III.\n\nThe heavy cost of warfare slowly drained Egypt\u2019s treasury and contributed to the gradual decline of the Egyptian Empire in Asia. The severity of the difficulties is indicated by the fact that the first known labor strike in recorded history occurred during the 29th year of Ramesses III\u2019s reign, over food rations. Despite a palace conspiracy which may have killed Ramesses III, three of his sons ascended the throne successively as Ramesses IV, Ramesses VI and Ramesses VIII. Egypt was increasingly beset by droughts, below-normal flooding of the Nile, famine, civil unrest, and official corruption. The power of the last pharaoh of the dynasty, Ramesses XI, grew so weak that, in the south, the High Priests of Amun at Thebes became the de facto rulers of Upper Egypt. The Smendes controlled Lower Egypt even before Ramesses XI\u2019s death. Menes eventually founded the Twenty-first Dynasty at Tanis.\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thutmose-III/Adornment-of-Egypt", "page_content": "Adornment of Egypt\n\nThe new prosperity was reflected in the remarkable program of building undertaken by the king\u2019s architects. The Temple of Amon at Karnak in particular was enlarged and enriched by many new buildings and a number of obelisks. Two of the splendid granite obelisks that he erected there are now in Istanbul and Rome; of the two, now known as Cleopatra\u2019s Needles, with which he adorned the temple of the sun god at Heliopolis, one is in New York City\u2019s Central Park and the other on the Thames embankment in London. During Thutmose III\u2019s reign, art and craftsmanship received new impetus from his patronage. The exotic birds, beasts, and plants that he brought back from his campaigns in Asia are depicted on the walls of his Festival Hall at Karnak; among the gifts sent him from abroad were a live bear, an elephant, a giraffe, and \u201cbirds that give birth every day\u201d\u2014probably domestic hens, which were rare in the Middle East at that time.\n\nThe last decade of his reign is marked by the building of a new temple at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b, next to Hatshepsut\u2019s mortuary temple. At the same time, a systematic program was instituted by Thutmose III to erase the record of her kingship and to ascribe her monuments to her immediate predecessors, Thutmose I and Thutmose II. The motive for Hatshepsut\u2019s proscription at such a late date is not fully understood, but most of her cartouches and images vanished from public view.\n\nDuring the last years of his life, Thutmose appointed his son Amenhotep II, the son of his second wife, Meryetre, as coregent. When he died, in 1426 bce, he was laid to rest in a remote corner of the Valley of the Kings in western Thebes. The mummy of the pharaoh was one of those discovered in 1889, in a hiding place where the priest-kings of the 21st dynasty (1075\u2013c. 950 bce) had put them for safety. Of the rich furniture that must originally have been placed in the tomb, only a few fragments were found. A memorial temple, which he built on a terrace at Dayr al-Ba\u1e25r\u012b beside that of Hatshepsut, was discovered in 1962.\n\nIn the southern reaches of the western Theban mountain, the burial place of three members of his harem was found; judging by their names, they were Asiatic princesses, and though of minor rank their jewelry and equipment were extremely lavish.\n\nOf all the kings of ancient Egypt, Thutmose III is perhaps the one who, for the modern historian, most nearly comes to life. His records, though couched in the boastful and extravagant terms thought befitting a pharaoh\u2019s exploits, leave little doubt not only of his ability as a soldier and a statesman but also of his abilities as an athlete and a hunter of lion, wild cattle, and elephant. From his mummy it is known that he was a small man, not above five feet three inches (1.6 metres) in height. His statues show a youthful, smooth face with a large, high-bridged nose and pleasantly smiling mouth.\n\nHis fame lived after him. His name inscribed on countless amulets was thought to bring power and protection to the wearers. A popular hymn celebrating his triumphs became a model for later paeans of victory. In it the god Amon-Re says:"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/thutmose-iii", "page_content": "Thutmose III\n\nFlourished Circa 1479-1425 b.c.e.\n\nKing, dynasty 18\n\nSources\n\nModel King. Thutmose III, a gifted warrior and administrator, consolidated his grandfather\u2019s conquests and continued to build important monuments throughout the country. He ruled from circa 1479-1425 b.c.e. during the New Kingdom (circa 1539-1075 b.c.e.), and he is the prototype of the ideal ancient Egyptian pharaoh.\n\nFamily. Thutmose III was the son of Thutmose II and his minor wife Queen Isis. He came to the throne as a child after the death of his father. The Great King\u2019s Wife Hatshepsut acted as regent while Thutmose III remained a minor. He had one half sister named Neferure. She was the daughter of Thutmose I and Hatshepsut. No other siblings are known. Though some scholars have argued that Thutmose III married Neferure, there is no concrete evidence to back this claim. Thutmose III did, however, marry Sit-iakh, who became the mother of his oldest son, Amenemhet, who died young. A second wife, Meryetre-Hatshepsut, was the mother of the next king, Amenhotep II. She was likely a commoner. A third wife, Nebtu, is only known by name. Four other royal children are known.\n\nEarly Training and Career. Thutmose III claimed his early life was spent in training as a priest of the god Amun. In this period he learned to read and write hieroglyphs, a skill not always mastered by kings. During a procession of the god, the priests carrying the god\u2019s statue stumbled in front of the young Thutmose III. This event was interpreted as a sign that Amun had chosen the child to follow Thutmose II on the throne. This inscription is interpreted to mean that Thutmose III was not the obvious heir to the throne, but needed the endorsement of the Amun priesthood before he could be recognized. This text also resembled in its details a description of the accession of Thutmose I to the throne, another king who was not the obvious heir.\n\nMilitary Indoctrination. The remainder of Thutmose Ill\u2019s early years was spent with the army. Military training was the most common education for future kings. It is possible that Thutmose III led his first military expeditions later in this period, while Hatshepsut remained chief administrator of the country.\n\nSole Rule. Following Hatshepsut\u2019s death in 1458 b.c.e., the now adult Thutmose III assumed sole control of the throne in Year 22 of his reign. During the following seventeen years, Thutmose III undertook at least fourteen military campaigns, consolidating Egyptian control as far as the Euphrates River to the east and the Fourth Cataract of the Nile River in Nubia to the south. He thus completed the conquests that his grandfather, Thutmose I, had begun. Thutmose III became the New Kingdom prototype of the warrior-king, describing himself as \u201ca king who fights by himself, to whom a multitude is no concern; for he is abler than a million men in a vast army. No equal to him has been found, a fighter aggressive on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nCampaigns. Thutmose Ill\u2019s army fought during fourteen military campaigns between Year 22 and Year 42 of his reign. The three most significant campaigns were fought against Egypt\u2019s most important northern enemies. In Year 22 he defeated the coalition of Syrian city-states led by Qadesh at the town of Megiddo. In Year 33 he defeated the state of Mitanni located on the east side of the Euphrates River. In Year 42 he defeated the Syrian city-state of Tunip. In each of these campaigns, Thutmose III demonstrated superior military abilities.\n\nBuilding Projects. Thutmose III also initiated many building projects within both Egypt and Nubia. Eight temples have been discovered in Nubia, while seven temples are known in Upper Egypt. Texts from the reign referred to nearly fifty separate building projects. In Thebes he constructed mortuary temples for his father and grandfather as well as his own. He also added important buildings to the Karnak complex, including the Hall of Annals and the Akh-menu, decorated with the unusual plant life that Thutmose observed on his foreign expeditions.\n\nDeath. Thutmose III died in Year 54 of his reign. He had appointed his son Amenhotep II co-regent in the previous year, ensuring a smooth transition to the new reign. He was buried in the tomb prepared for him in the Valley of the Kings. Thutmose III remained a model of the ideal king for many subsequent generations of Egyptians.\n\nBetsy M.

His throne name, Thutmose, translates as \u2018Thoth is Born,\u2019 while \u2018Menkhperre\u2019 his birth name means \u2018Eternal are the Manifestations of Ra.\u2019 Both Thutmose III\u2019s names acknowledged two of ancient Egypt\u2019s most powerful deities.\n\nFacts About Thutmose III\n\n6th king of Egypt\u2019s 18th Dynasty and national hero, Thutmose III was revered by his people\n\nOne of antiquity\u2019s greatest military leaders, successfully leading 17 military campaigns in 20 years, amassing enormous wealth for Egypt\n\nA military genius, he mastered the art of surprise attacks, rapid movement, logistics and lines of supply\n\nThutmose III\u2019s artisans created some of the finest work in Egypt\u2019s history, from elaborate tombs enlivened with ornate paintings to the massive pylons in Karnak, painting, sculpting and glass making flowered\n\nHe erected many of Egypt\u2019s majestic obelisks including those now set in New York, Istanbul, Rome and London today\n\nThutmose III\u2019s Family Lineage\n\nThutmose III was the son of Thutmose II (1492-1479 BCE) and Iset one of Thutmose II\u2019s lesser wives. Thutmose II was also married to Queen Hatshepsut (1479-1458 BCE), a royal daughter of Thutmose I (1520-1492 BCE) who also carried out the role of God\u2019s Wife of Amun..\n\nWhen Thutmose II died, Thutmose III was only three years old, too young to rule so Hatshepsut became regent. Hatshepsut later declared herself pharaoh and assumed the throne herself, emerging as one of the most powerful women in Egyptian history.\n\nWhen Thutmose III came of age his stepmother gave him command of Egypt\u2019s armed forces. It was an inspired decision, even if politically motivated. Thutmose III proved himself to be a charismatic leader and an exceptional military strategist.\n\nThutmose III During Hatshepsut\u2019s Regency And His Rise To Power\n\nThutmose III grew up at the royal court in Egypt\u2019s capital Thebes. Little documented evidence of his early life survived. However as was the custom in Egypt\u2019s New Kingdom, the physical and intellectual development of a prince was a major focus of their education.\n\nThutmose III is believed to have studied military tactics and strategies together with athletics while in school. It is also thought he participated in Hatshepsut\u2019s early campaigns abroad. It was common practice amongst New Kingdom pharaohs to immerse their successors in the military at an early age. During this time, Thutmose III is said to have honed his skills in hand-to-hand combat, archery and horsemanship.\n\nDuring Thutmose III\u2019s formative years, his stepmother reigned over one of Egypt\u2019s most prosperous times. Once Hatshepsut\u2019s initial campaigns had secured her reign, there were few major overseas deployments and the army primarily focused on protecting trade and maintaining orders along Egypt\u2019s long borders.\n\nUpon Hatshepsut\u2019s death in 1458 BCE, and Thutmose III\u2019s ascension to the throne, the kings of Egyptian-vassal states in Syria and Canaan rebelled. Thutmose III preferred direct action rather than negotiation so he left Egypt on his first military campaign.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s Military Campaigns\n\nDuring his time on the throne, Thutmose III successfully led 17 military campaigns in 20 years. At the pharaoh\u2019s direction, details of his victories were inscribed at Karnak\u2019s Temple of Amun. Today, there are acknowledged to be the most exhaustive records of ancient Egypt\u2019s military campaigns in existence.\n\nThutmose III\u2019s first campaign climaxed at The Battle of Megiddo, his most famous battle. The account of the campaign comes to us from Thutmose III\u2019s private secretary (c. 1455 BCE).\n\nTjaneni provides a detailed description of Thutmose III as a commander-in-chief supremely confident in his own ability and of victory. By taking a little-used cattle track, Thutmose III achieved tactical surprise and routed his enemy. Thutmose III then marched on the city and besieged it for eight months until they surrendered. Thutmose III returned home laden with an enormous campaign loot, having lingered only to harvest the defeated army\u2019s crops.\n\nMegiddo saw Thutmose III initiate a policy that continued throughout all his subsequent campaigns. He brought the noble children of defeated kings back to Egypt to be educated as Egyptians. When they came of age, they were allowed to return home where many continued supporting Egyptian interests.\n\nVictory at Megiddo gave Thutmose III control of northern Canaan. His Nubian campaigns proved equally successful. By Thutmose III\u2019s 50th year, he had expanded Egypt\u2019s borders beyond those of any of his predecessors, making Egypt wealthier than it had been at any time since the start of the Old Kingdom\u2019s 4th Dynasty (c. 2613- 2181 BCE).\n\nThutmose III And The Arts\n\nThutmose III\u2019s reign was not only absorbed by military campaigns. His patronage of the arts extended to his commissioning of 50 temples along with countless monuments and tombs. Thutmose III also contributed more to the Temple of Amun at Karnak than other pharaohs. Ironically, his refurbishment of the Karnak temple preserved the names of past kings and provided descriptions outlining of his own military campaigns.\n\nUnder Thutmose III, artistic skills flowered. Glass making was refined and mastered. Statuary adopted less idealized and more realistic styles. Thutmose III\u2019s artisans created some of the finest work in Egypt\u2019s long history. From elaborate tombs embellished with complex paintings and freestanding columns to the massive pylons in Karnak. Thutmose III also created public parks and gardens, complete with ponds and lakes for his subject\u2019s recreation, while a private garden surrounded both his palace and his Karnak temple.\n\nDefacing Hatshepsut\u2019s Monuments\n\nOne of the most controversial acts attributed to Thutmose III is his desecration of Hatshepsut\u2019s monuments and his attempt to erase her name from historical records.\n\nAccording to Egyptian religious belief, to expunge a person\u2019s name was to doom them to non-existence. For an ancient Egyptian to continue their eternal journey in the afterlife they needed to be remembered.\n\nThe current view amongst most scholars is that Thutmose III ordered this campaign to prevent Hatshepsut from becoming a role model for future Queens who may aspire to rule. In the Egyptian afterlife, there was no place in the narrative for a woman to ascend the throne and wield power.\n\nOne of the key responsibilities of a pharaoh was to maintain ma\u2019at, the principle of harmony and balance at the heart of ancient Egyptian culture. This is thought to be the motivation behind Thutmose III\u2019s expunction of Hatshepsut\u2019s name.\n\nLegacy\n\nThutmose III left a substantial legacy of military greatness. Thutmose III took an isolated and weakened nation and transformed Egypt into an imperial power. By carving an empire stretching from the Euphrates River in Mesopotamia across to Syria and the Levant and down to the Fifth Cataract of the Nile in Nubia, Thutmose III cemented Egypt\u2019s influence as a powerful and prosperous nation. Thutmose III epitomized the ideal of the Egyptian warrior-king who led his military to successive glorious victories, cementing his status as an Egyptian national hero and one of the greatest kings of ancient Egypt.\n\nReflecting On The Past\n\nWas Thutmose III really an ancient Napoleon, a brilliant general who never lost a battle or merely a skilled propagandist who stole Hatshepsut\u2019s legacy?\n\nHeader image courtesy: Louvre Museum [CC BY-SA 2.0 fr], via Wikimedia Commons"}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/empires/egypt/newkingdom/tuthmosis3.html", "page_content": "\n\nClick on the image for a gallery view Forced to wait more than 20 years to become pharaoh, Tuthmosis (reigned c1458 - 1425 BC) was a man in a hurry when he finally took power. His military victories made Egypt one of the richest countries on Earth.\n\n\n\nWhen his father died, Tuthmosis was just a young boy. His stepmother, Hatshepsut, was regent until he grew older, but then seized the throne and ruled as pharaoh herself in his place. Tuthmosis was denied his throne until Hatshepsut died, more than 20 years later.\n\n\n\nOpportunity knocks\n\n\n\nEgypt was powerful, but it still had many enemies. The death of a pharaoh presented them with a perfect opportunity to test the strength of the new leader. A coalition of foreign princes gathered in the city of Megiddo, threatening Egyptian trade and influence in the area.\n\n\n\nPerhaps they thought that Tuthmosis would be weak or hesitant: if so, they were seriously wrong. Having waited so long for power, Tuthmosis had big plans. He had been head of the army before he took the throne and knew that military victory was the best way to popular acclaim and immortality.\n\n\n\nPlanning ahead\n\n\n\nHe didn't just want to defend Egypt against its enemies; he wanted their lands for himself. He enlisted 20,000 soldiers - either voluntarily or by force - and trained them for an attack on Megiddo.\n\n\n\nThe army marched across the Sinai desert and up the Mediterranean coastline. Along the way, a team of scribes - the world's first war correspondents - recorded the army's progress and victories, and gave an idea of life in the pharaoh's army .\n\n\n\nClick on the image for a gallery view Surprise attack\n\n\n\nWhen the army arrived at Megiddo, Tuthmosis had to figure out his plan of attack. Against the advice of his generals, he decided to take the most direct - and most dangerous - route to the city, figuring that the enemy would not expect him to be so bold.\n\n\n\nHe was right. His attack surprised the enemy army, which was camped outside Megiddo, and he quickly defeated them.\n\n\n\nWait and see\n\n\n\nTuthmosis lost momentum, however, when his army stopped to plunder the enemy camp. This allowed the survivors to escape and hide behind the walls of the city. Now he had to sit it out. For seven months, Tuthmosis and his army kept the city under siege while raiding the surrounding countryside.\n\n\n\nWith its population starving, Megiddo finally surrendered. The city and its people now belonged to Tuthmosis, along with all its wealth. The war booty that Tuthmosis brought back to Thebes made it one of the richest and greatest cities in the Ancient World.\n\n\n\nBringing up baby\n\n\n\nTuthmosis also had the clever idea of bringing back the children of his defeated enemies. As they grew up, they were sent back to replace their fathers as part-Egyptians, not enemies, cementing Egyptian rule.\n\n\n\nIn the important gold-producing region of Nubia, originally conquered by Ahmose, Tuthmosis went one step further to secure control. He appointed a viceroy to rule over the area. The viceroy - the \"Overseer of the Gold Countries\" - ensured that Nubia's gold poured into Thebes giving Egypt all the gold it needed to rule its new empire. Map of Egypt at the end of Tuthmosis III reign\n\n\n\nWhat did he achieve?\n\n\n\nJust 100 years earlier, Egypt had been on the verge of extinction. Tuthmosis changed all that. He conquered more land than any pharaoh before or after. By the end of his reign, Egypt controlled Nubia, the Syrian and Lebanese coasts and vast areas of Israel and Palestine. It was the biggest empire ever conquered and ruled by one king.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere to next:\n\nPharaohs - Hatshepsut\n\nEgyptian society - Soldiers\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Video\n\nTuthmosis thanks Amen-Re\n\nWatch the video (1:03)\n\nRequires free Real Player\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/thutmose-iii-temple-artifacts-statue.html", "page_content": "Bas-relief of Thutmose III from Amada Temple in Nubia\n\nThe Temple\n\nThutmose III built the Temple of Amun in his later years. It is located at Deir el-Bahari, also known as The Northern Monastery, on the West Bank of the Nile across from the city of Luxor. Deir el-Bahari is a group of funerary temples separated from the Valley of the Kings by the mountain, el-Qurn. Three mortuary temples exist at Deir el-Bahari; Montuhotep, Hatshepsut, and Thutmose III. The temple of Thutmose III is between the other two, and higher on the mountain. Partially dug into the side of a mountain, the temple is accessible by three terraces with the temple itself on the topmost terrace. While the temple takes some of its style from his stepmother Hatshepsut's, it is believed that it was built to upstage hers, as he worked to eradicate her name from the historical record.\n\nThe temple, dedicated to Amun, is square with a large hypostyle hall with eighty-eight columns. A hypostyle hall is a large room with columns and a central aisle. The central aisle is the only portion illuminated by small windows overhead. It is meant to represent a marsh, with the columns representing papyrus plants. The central aisle was a river for the Barque, or boat, of Amun to travel during the Beautiful Feast of the Valley. The temple was used for worship until the 20th dynasty, 1189 - 1077 BCE, when an earthquake, and subsequent landslide, damaged the temple beyond repair. Sandstone from the original temple was scavenged for other construction and later used as a cemetery, for a monastery, established on the grounds of Hatshepsut's temple.\n\nTemples at Deir el-Bahari\n\nWhat did archaeologists find?\n\nDiscovered during restoration work on the temples of Montuhotep II and Hatshepsut, excavation began on Thutmose III's temple in 1961. The restoration, begun by the Polish Center of Mediterranean Archaeology, revealed brightly painted bas-reliefs. A bas-relief is a carving that projects slightly from the flat wall to give a three-dimensional look. Much of the temple is gone but the walls, columns, and chambers that remain have been restored.\n\nThutmose III dedicated a great deal of energy to the Temple of Karnak where he built numerous temples and pylons. He dismantled Hatshepsut's chapel and rebuilt the hypostyle hall built by his grandfather, Thutmose I. Here we find a number of sandstone sculptures and bas-reliefs depicting the many triumphs of Thutmose III. Many of the bas-reliefs here are dedicated to his military campaigns and the things he saw on his travels.\n\nThutmose III smiting the Canaanites during the Battle of Megiddo-Bas-relief at Karnak"}]}
