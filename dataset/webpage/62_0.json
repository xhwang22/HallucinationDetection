Lee distinguished himself academically, studying mathematics and graduating with a first-class degree (1974) from the University of Cambridge before earning a master\u2019s degree (1980) in public administration from Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. He then became an officer in the Singaporean military, eventually rising to the rank of brigadier general.\n\nLee\u2019s political career began in 1984 when he joined his father\u2019s party, the ruling People\u2019s Action Party. Later that year he was elected to Parliament and was also appointed minister of state in both the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defense. In 1985 he chaired the Economic Committee, which recommended a large tax reduction and the implementation of a consumption tax. A year later he was elected to his party\u2019s Central Executive Committee, and in 1987 he became minister for trade and industry and second minister of defense. Lee assumed the position of deputy prime minister immediately upon the ascension of his father\u2019s successor as prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, in 1990. Lee was treated for lymphoma in the early 1990s. The cancer ultimately went into remission, and he made a vigorous return to political life, serving as chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (1998\u20132004) and as finance minister (2001\u201307).\n\nOn August 12, 2004, Lee assumed office as prime minister of Singapore, replacing the outgoing Goh. The transition had been planned and occurred without an election. Lee\u2019s father was appointed to the newly created cabinet post of \u201cminister mentor,\u201d and Goh remained as the senior cabinet member; both men resigned from the cabinet in 2011. In addition, Lee\u2019s wife, Ho Ching, served as executive director of the government-run investment firm Temasek Holdings, which owned stakes in some of Singapore\u2019s largest companies. The cabinet included for the first time two female ministers of state; it was made up primarily of appointees who had been reassigned from other ministry posts.\n\nWhile observers expected Lee to retain tight control over the prosperous city-state, he appeared sensitive to the desire among many Singaporeans for a more open society. He promised to permit greater freedoms in a country where rigid social policies and limits on political expression were strictly enforced. Revised guidelines on free speech were announced shortly after Lee was sworn in, but while certain restrictions were eased\u2014licenses for indoor political meetings were no longer required, for example\u2014many remained intact. During his tenure as prime minister, Lee was subject to charges of nepotism and corruption and, as had his father, took a number of his detractors to court for libel. Though he was successful in such legal proceedings, he drew disapprobation over what was perceived internationally as the suppression of free speech.\n\nLee championed the legalization of gambling in 2005, attracting significant foreign investment in the development of casino facilities. His 2006 economic package disbursed a portion of the large budget surplus as a bonus to citizens and channeled money to health care, education, and housing programs. Even greater attention was paid to those programs after the 2011 parliamentary elections, when opposition candidates made an unexpectedly strong showing. Notable was the creation of a compulsory health care insurance plan, which was to go into effect by the end of 2015.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In response, Lee promised to donate a significant portion of his earnings to charity and to voluntarily subject himself to a salary freeze. Continued criticism of the high salaries, however, prompted the government in 2012 to cut the pay of ministers (including the prime minister) by about one-third and that of Singapore\u2019s president by half."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/southeast-asia-history-biographies/lee-hsien-loong", "page_content": "Lee Hsien Loong\n\nAfter a brilliant 13-year career in the Singapore Armed Forces Lee Hsien Loong (born 1952) was elected a member of Parliament for Teck Ghee in 1984, winning more than 80 percent of the vote. In October 1990 he became deputy prime minister to Goh Chok Tong.\n\nLee Hsien Loong, the eldest son of Singapore's former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, was born in Singapore on February 10, 1952. Lee had an outstanding record as a student. He received his primary and secondary school education at the Catholic High School in Singapore, which required students to be proficient in both English and Mandarin. In addition to these two languages, he was proficient in Malay and had also studied Russian. He attended the National Junior College for his pre-university education and was awarded the president's scholarship in 1970 and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) scholarship in 1971 for his academic prowess.\n\nHe proceeded to Cambridge University to study mathematics. In 1974 he graduated with first-class honors in mathematics and was also awarded a diploma in computer science with distinction from the same university. In 1978 he attended the U.S. Army Command and General Staff Course at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. One year later he was a Mason fellow at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he received a Master of Public Administration degree in 1980.\n\nLee's connection with the army began in 1971, when he was awarded the SAF scholarship to study mathematics at Cambridge University. However, his military career did not begin until 1974 when he was assigned to an artillery division on his return to Singapore. His first major appointment in the SAF occurred in 1980, when he was made commanding officer of the Artillery Gun Battalion. After that he was promoted with astonishing speed to assistant chief of the General Staff (Operations) in 1981; to chief of staff of the General Staff in 1982; and to director, Joint Operations Planning Directorate with the rank of brigadier general in 1983. He was publicly commended for his role in coordinating the Sentosa cable car rescue operations in 1982. He was also credited for two achievements during his SAF career\u2014the unification of the SAF's three services and the modernization of its weaponry. He resigned from the SAF on September 21, 1984. Following his election to Parliament as a member of the People's Action Party (PAP), he was appointed political secretary to the minister for defense by the prime minister.\n\nLee's rise within the PAP and government hierarchies was even more rapid. In January 1985 he was appointed as minister of state (MOS) in two key ministries: the Ministry of Defense (MINDEF) and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). As MOS in the MIT, Lee chaired the Economic Committee set up one month after his appointment to tackle the economic recession facing the country. The creation of the Economic Committee can be viewed as the beginning of the PAP government's consultative style of leadership, as Lee managed to obtain feedback and views on the causes of the recession as well as suggestions for ensuring economic recovery from about a thousand participants from both the public and private sectors in Singapore. The Economic Committee completed its report one year later, and its 12 recommendations enabled the government to deal successfully with the economic recession.\n\nIn February 1986, Lee was appointed acting minister for trade and industry and he also retained his MOS position in MINDEF. During the same year, he was made chairman of the newly created PAP Youth Wing. In January 1987, he was confirmed as minister for trade and industry and promoted to second minister for defense (services). Two years later, he was appointed as the second assistant secretary-general of the PAP's Central Executive Committee. Then, in October 1990, six years after he became an MP, he was appointed as one of the two deputy prime ministers with Ong Teng Cheong.\n\nGiven his outstanding performance in the army and his meteoric rise up the party and government hierarchies, it was not surprising that Lee was expected by most Singaporeans to succeed Goh Chok Tong as Singapore's third prime minister when Goh retired from the political scene. However, in November 1992 the government announced that Lee was diagnosed as suffering from an intermediate grade malignant lymphoma. After undergoing 18 weeks of chemotherapy, Lee's health improved as his doctors reported in April 1993 that there was \"no evidence of any residual disease.\" Lee's health remained stable and he kept his position as deputy prime minister. In the 1997 elections, the PAP won all but two of Singapore's 83 seats in Parliament; Lee and Goh remained in their governmental positions.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nLee Hsien Loong's speeches as minister for trade and industry and as deputy prime minister can be found in Speeches, which was published by the Ministry of Communications and Information until November 1990, and then by the Ministry of Information and the Arts from December 1990 onwards. His three most significant speeches are: \"Salary Revision for the Administrative, Professional, and Other Services\" (March 17, 1989); \"Core Principles of Government\" (1992); and \"Costs of Living and Medical Costs\" (Petir, October 1992).

He is the third and current Prime Minister of Singapore, and has been in office since 2004. He is the eldest son of Singapore's first Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew.\n\nAs the Secretary-General of the People's Action Party (PAP), Lee became Prime Minister in August 2004, succeeding Goh Chok Tong. He has been a Member of Parliament (MP) for Teck Ghee since 1984 and a member of the Cabinet since 1987, and was one of the key leaders in Singapore's political transition in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nBefore becoming Prime Minister in 2004 he served as the Minister for Trade and Industry, Minister for Finance and Deputy Prime Minister. Prior to his election to Parliament, he served as an officer in the Singapore Armed Forces, quickly rising to the rank of Brigadier-General.[citation needed]\n\nBackground and education\n\nThe eldest child of Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew and his wife Kwa Geok Choo, Lee Hsien Loong was born in Singapore on 10 February 1952. His paternal grandmother, Chua Jim Neo, was a Hokkien Nyonya, and his mother has ancestry from Tong'an District, Xiamen, Fujian, China.[2][3] According to Lee Kuan Yew's biography, the younger Lee had learnt the Jawi script from the age of five, and has always been interested in the affairs of Singapore, often following his father to the rally grounds since 1963.\n\nLee studied at Nanyang Primary School and received his secondary education at Catholic High School, before going on to National Junior College (where he learned the clarinet under the tutelage of Adjunct Associate Professor Ho Hwee Long). In 1971, he was awarded a President's Scholarship and Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Scholarship by the Public Service Commission to study mathematics at Trinity College, University of Cambridge. He was senior wrangler in 1973,[4][5] and graduated in 1974 with first class honours in mathematics and a diploma in computer science (with distinction). In 1980, he completed a Master of Public Administration at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University.\n\nMilitary career\n\nLee joined the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in 1971. In 1978, he attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, and held various staff and command posts, including the Director of the Joint Operations and Plans Directorate, and Chief of Staff of the General Staff. Lee rose quickly through the ranks in the Singapore Army, becoming the youngest brigadier-general in Singaporean history after his promotion in July 1983. Notably, he was put in command of the rescue operations following the Sentosa Cable Car Disaster. Lee left the SAF in 1984 to pursue civilian politics.[6]\n\nEarly political career\n\nIn the 1980s, Lee was regarded as the core member of the next batch of new leaders in the People's Action Party (PAP) leadership transition that was taking place in the mid-1980s, as Lee Kuan Yew had declared that he would step down as prime minister in 1984. Following the 1984 general election, all of the old Central Executive Committee members resigned on 1 January 1985, except for Lee Kuan Yew himself.[7]\n\nLee was elected a Member of Parliament (MP) in 1984 at the age of thirty-two and he has been re-elected seven times, most recently in 2015 as an MP for the Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency. Following his election, he was appointed as minister of state at the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence by his father, who was the prime minister at the time.\n\nIn 1985, Lee chaired the government's economic committee, which recommended changes to established government policies to reduce business costs, foster longer-term growth and revive the Singapore economy, which was experiencing a recession at the time. The committee's recommendations included reductions in corporate and personal taxes and the introduction of a consumption tax.\n\nIn 1986, Lee was appointed the acting minister for Trade and Industry. In 1987, he became a full member of the Cabinet as the minister for trade and Industry and second minister for defence.\n\nLee was the chairman of the PAP Youth Committee, the predecessor to the Young PAP, when it was established in 1986, while he was still a brigadier-general. The PAP had been undergoing leadership transition, and many of its key leaders were aging, with younger replacements scarce. PAP branches were urged to recruit 40-50 members each. Lee envisioned there would be a lot of young people who were \"idealistic, patriotic, nationalistic, keen to work for the nation.\" Lee's goal was to maintain the preeminence of the PAP such that \"when the people think about the government of Singapore, if they think about the future of Singapore, then they will think about the PAP\". Lee also said that the youth wing would be a channel in which the youth could communicate dissent, in which otherwise they might be \"tempted\" to vote for the opposition political parties and bring the PAP government down.[8]\n\nDeputy Prime Minister\n\nOn 28 November 1990, Goh Chok Tong took over from Lee Kuan Yew as Singapore's Prime Minister, and Lee Hsien Loong was made one of two Deputy Prime Ministers (along with Ong Teng Cheong). He also continued to serve as the Minister for Trade and Industry until 1992.\n\nIn 1992, Lee was diagnosed with lymphoma and underwent a three-month period of chemotherapy. When his treatment began, he relinquished his position as the Minister for Trade and Industry, though he continued to be a Deputy Prime Minister. His chemotherapy was successful, and his cancer has since gone into remission.\n\nLee was appointed Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 1998, and in 2001 he was made the Minister for Finance.\n\nTo ease the growing budget deficit due to falling tax revenues from cuts in corporate and personal income taxes and other factors such as the Iraq War and SARS outbreak, Lee proposed on 29 August 2003 to raise the GST from three percent to five percent, a change which took place in January 2004.\n\nLee also initiated several relaxations of the requirements for Singapore citizenship, notably for foreign-born children of Singaporean women.[9] The changes were made after repeated pleas from MPs and the Remaking Singapore Committee.\n\nIn the sphere of domestic politics, Lee played a key role as Deputy Prime Minister. In an interview with the media in 1996, ahead of the 1997 general election, he outlined what the ruling party looked for in its candidates for Members of Parliament.[10]\n\nOn the international front, Lee helped build relations with other countries like New Zealand.[11]\n\nPrime Minister\n\n2004\n\nIn the months leading up to Lee taking over as Singapore's third Prime Minister in 2004, he was already signalling reforms in some key areas, including ceding more space to the private and people sectors. Of the government's role, he said in a speech: \"Nanny should not look after everything all the time\".[12]\n\nOn 12 August 2004, Lee succeeded Goh Chok Tong as Prime Minister and relinquished his chairmanship of the Monetary Authority of Singapore to Goh Chok Tong. Lee was sworn in by Chief Justice Yong Pung How at the Istana.\n\nLee made his maiden National Day Rally on 12 August 2004. In his speech, Lee initiated the policy of the \"Five-day work week\", a plan that would remove a half-working day on Saturday. The plan took effect on 1 January 2005.\n\nLee also proposed two-month paid maternity leave for mothers of newborn children and financial incentives to mothers who give birth to a fourth child. These policies were initiated in response to the declining birth rate that Singapore has experienced in recent years.\n\nIn November 2004, Lee sparked a national debate when he revealed a proposal to build two Integrated Resorts (IRs) which are holiday resorts with casinos. In April 2005, despite some opposition expressed by the public, Lee announced the decision to approve the proposal. The two IRs were built in Marina Bay and Sentosa. To limit the negative social impact of casino gambling, Lee suggested that safeguards be implemented, such as prohibiting minors from entering the casinos and charging a S$100 entrance fee for Singaporeans and permanent residents or S$2000 for a year-long entrance fee.\n\n2006 general election\n\nIn February 2006, three months before the general election, Lee announced in parliament a S$2.6 billion bonus called the Progress Package.[13][14] The plan was to distribute budget surpluses accumulated from the past few years in the form of cash to all adult Singaporeans, top-ups to the state pension savings for elders, rental and utilities rebates for those living in public housing, educational funds for school children from low-income families, and cash bonuses for low-wage workers above 40 and for those men who have completed National Service. The cash bonuses was distributed in early May 2006.\n\nCritics, especially members of the opposition, have slammed the Progress Package as a \"vote-buying exercise\" for the Singapore parliamentary election held on 6 May 2006. In that election, Lee led the People's Action Party to win 82 of the 84 seats, including 37 walkovers. Lee and his six-member team won the Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency (GRC) with 96,591 (60.42%) votes out of the total 159,872 votes cast. Most of the opposition Workers' Party (WP)'s team of six were in their 20s and the constituency was contested for the first time in 15 years.\n\nIts decision to contest Ang Mo Kio came as a surprise, as the opposition was expected to stay away from GRCs helmed by heavyweight ministers; but the party said that giving Ang Mo Kio residents a chance to vote was a prime reason for contesting the GRC. Given the inexperience of the WP team and Lee Hsien Loong's position as the Prime Minister, they won a surprisingly strong 49,468 votes (30.94%). There were also an extremely high percentage of void votes: 13,813 (8.64%).\n\n2010\n\nIn May 2010, Lee instituted electoral reforms to the current electoral system by reducing the number of group representation constituencies (GRC), increased the number of Non-constituency Members of Parliament (NCMPs) to a maximum of nine (inclusive of the number of elected opposition members of Parliament), and the number of Nominated Members of Parliament (NMPs) permanent also to nine. Also part of the reforms was the legalization of internet campaigning and mandating a \"cooling-off\" day where campaigning is prohibited except for party political broadcasts.\n\n2011\n\nEffective 1 June 2011, Lee was named chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) which manages more than S$100 billion of assets. He succeeded his father, Lee Kuan Yew, who remained as senior advisor to the fund until his death.[15]\n\n2011 general election\n\nIn April 2011, a general election was called for 7 May 2011. For the second time, the PAP was not return to government on Nomination Day with only one uncontested walkover. In the final results, the PAP saw a 6.46% swing against it from the 2006 elections to 60.14%, its lowest since independence.[16] While the PAP met most expectations to sweep into power and claim over two-thirds of parliamentary seats, it won 81 out of 87 seats, and lost Aljunied Group Representation Constituency to the Workers' Party (WP), the first time a GRC was won by an opposition party. Two cabinet ministers, namely Foreign Minister George Yeo and Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Lim Hwee Hua, were defeated.[17]\n\nLater on, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong tendered their resignations from the Cabinet, stating that they wished to give the Prime Minister a \"fresh clean slate\" in forming the government and enable him to \"have a completely younger team of ministers to connect to and engage with this young generation\".[18] Lee and Goh were appointed as senior advisers to the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) respectively.[19][20]\n\nLee was sworn-in into a second term on 21 May 2011. His new cabinet included three newly appointed ministers. S. Iswaran, formerly Senior Minister of State for Education and for Trade and Industry, was elevated to the Cabinet as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, and Second Minister for Home Affairs and for Trade and Industry. Heng Swee Keat and Chan Chun Sing, both elected to Parliament for the first time, were respectively assigned the posts of Minister for Education, and Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports and Minister of State for the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts.[21][22] Heng was the first new MP directly appointed a full minister since 1984.[23][24]\n\n2012\n\nOn 20 April 2012, Lee set up his Facebook page to connect with Singaporean netizens.[25]\n\nForeign relations\n\nChina\n\nRelations with China have improved under Lee's administration. Smooth progress has been made in areas of trade, tourism and investment, which is not merely in accordance with the interest of the two countries, but promises to be beneficial to the common development of the region. The China-Singapore Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation (JCBC) is responsible for promoting Sino-Singaporean co-operation.\n\nDuring his meeting with vice-premier Wu Yi in September 2005, Lee proposed the establishment of a China-ASEAN Free Trade Zone, which would achieve the goal of realizing US$50 billion in trade volume before 2010. In doing so, both agreed that relations between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) should be elevated.\n\nDuring his seven-day visit to China in late October 2005, the Prime Minister stressed the need of improving bilateral diplomatic relationships between ASEAN and China. Lee also urged leaders to focus on the next wave of growth in north-eastern China, saying: \"It is a long-term commitment. There is no place in the world that you can go in and your money just grows on trees. Not in China.\"\n\nUnited States\n\nFile:Bush Lee.jpg Lee visits the United States in July 2005.\n\nSingapore has generally had a favourable relationship with the United States. The growth of bilateral trade improved commercial and diplomatic ties between the two countries after the implementation of the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement and the growth in bilateral trade has been evident since the Free Trade Agreement became effective on 1 January 2004.\n\nLee made his inaugural visit to the United States, as Prime Minister of Singapore, between 6 July and 16 July 2005. Several other ministers, notably Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean and Foreign Minister George Yeo, accompanied Lee.\n\nOn 12 July 2005, President of the United States George W. Bush and Lee signed the \"Strategic Framework Agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Singapore for a Closer Cooperation Partnership in Defence and Security\". The agreement was a natural step in the expansion of bilateral ties. President Bush and the then Singaporean prime minister Goh Chok Tong had first announced their intention to conclude this agreement in October 2003.\n\nThe intention of the agreement is to address common threats such as terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), which called for even closer cooperation between the United States and Singapore.\n\nThe agreement recognizes Singapore's role as a Major Security Cooperation Partner and will expand the scope of current cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, counter-proliferation, joint military exercises and training, policy dialogues and defence technology. The Agreement will further enhance regional stability by supporting the continued security presence of the United States in Southeast Asia.\n\nBoth Prime Minister Lee and United States President George W. Bush agreed that the American presence in Southeast Asia has promoted peace and stability, which are crucial for regional cooperation and economic development.\n\nDuring their meeting, both Bush and Lee acknowledged the progress in the war on terror. Lee commended Bush's 'resolute and steadfast stance in the war on terror' and expressed Singapore\u2019s continued support in this endeavour. In exchange, Bush commended the professionalism of the Singapore Armed Forces personnel, who have been deployed in support of Iraq operations over the past two years and of the Singapore Police Force, which has provided critically important training. Both Bush and Lee also pledged to sustain the close cooperation between the United States and Singapore in key regional and global multilateral institutions.\n\nControversies\n\nAs the eldest son of Singapore's first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Lee's career has been shadowed by allegations of nepotism.[26][27][28][29] At the age of 32, he became the youngest brigadier-general in Singaporean history, and from a young age was widely tipped to be Lee Kuan Yew's successor as Prime Minister. When Lee Kuan Yew stepped down as Prime Minister to make way for his successor, Goh Chok Tong, several critics had seen Goh as a seat-warmer, but Lee Kuan Yew said he had disproved that. In his memoirs, Lee Kuan Yew stressed that he could not have his son directly succeed him: \"It was better that someone else succeed me as Prime Minister. Then were Loong to make the grade later, it would be clear that he made it on his own merit.\"\n\nThe Lees are very sensitive to the issue of nepotism, with Lee explaining: \"And if anybody doubts that I as Prime Minister am here not because I'm the best man for the job but because my father fixed it, or that my wife runs Temasek because I put her there and not because she's the best woman for the job, then my entire credibility and moral authority is destroyed because I'm not fit to be where I am.\"[26][27]\n\nThe Lees have reacted strongly against published allegations of nepotism by taking legal action in Singapore courts, winning out-of-court settlements for defamation from the Financial Times (2007)[29] and the New York Times Company.[30] However, in a 2008 report, the International Bar Association Human Rights Institute (\"IBAHRI\") claimed that the \"slim likelihood\" of a successful defence to defamation, combined with high damages awarded in cases involving PAP officials, \"sheds doubt on the independence of the judiciary\" in cases involving PAP litigants or interests.[31]\n\nTaiwan\n\nOn 10 July 2004, Lee visited Taiwan, causing displeasure in China. On 28 August 2004 in his very first National Day Rally speech, he criticized the Taiwanese leadership and populace of overestimating the support they would receive if they were to declare Taiwan independence. At the same time, he also clarified during the rally that his visit to Taiwan in July was to ensure he gathered enough intelligence to make the right decisions when he took over the baton as Prime Minister. He reiterated his support for the One-China policy. Later that year in September, Foreign Minister George Yeo cautioned the United Nations General Assembly about the dangers of letting the cross-strait relationship deteriorate. In response, an enraged Taiwanese Foreign Minister, Mark Chen, called Singapore a \"nose-shit country\".[32] Chen later made a formal apology.[33]\n\nDefamation lawsuit: The New York Times Company\n\nIn 2010, Lee, together with the two former prime ministers who preceded him, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, threatened legal action against The New York Times Company which owns the International Herald Tribune regarding an Op-Ed piece titled \u2018All in the Family\u2019 of 15 February 2010 by Philip Bowring, a freelance columnist and former editor of the Far Eastern Economic Review. The International Herald Tribune apologized in March that readers of the article may \u2018infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit\u2019. The New York Times Company and Bowring also agreed to pay SG$60,000 to Lee, SG$50,000 to Lee Kuan Yew and SG$50,000 to Goh (total amounted to about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article also by Bowring that referred to \u2018dynastic politics\u2019 in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew. In response, media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders wrote an open letter to urge Lee and other top officials of the Singapore government to stop taking \u2018libel actions\u2019 against journalists.[30][34][35][36]\n\nSalary\n\nFrom 2008 to 2012, Lee earned an annual salary of S$3,870,000 (US$2,856,930),[37] an increase of 25% from the previous S$3,091,200 (US$2,037,168).[38] On January 2012, in response to public unhappiness at the high salary,[39] Lee took a 28% paycut reducing his salary to S$2.2 million (US$1.7 million).[40][41][42] He remains the highest-paid prime minister in the world.[43]\n\nIntegrated Resorts\n\nDuring a parliament session on 18 April 2005, Lee announced the cabinet's decision to develop two casinos[44] and associated hotels and malls in Marina South[45] and Sentosa.[46] In an official release, Lee announced in April 2005:\n\n<templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" />\n\n\"After weighing the matter carefully, the Cabinet has collectively concluded that we had no choice but to proceed with the IRs. As Prime Minister, I carry the ultimate responsibility for the decision.\"[47][48]\n\nThe National Council on Problem Gambling (Singapore) was set up in Singapore on 31 August 2005 to address problem gambling.

Lee distinguished himself academically, studying mathematics and graduating with a first-class degree (1974) from the University of Cambridge before earning a master\u2019s degree (1980) in public administration from Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. He then became an officer in the Singaporean military, eventually rising to the rank of brigadier general.\n\nLee\u2019s political career began in 1984 when he joined his father\u2019s party, the ruling People\u2019s Action Party. Later that year he was elected to Parliament and was also appointed minister of state in both the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defense. In 1985 he chaired the Economic Committee, which recommended a large tax reduction and the implementation of a consumption tax. A year later he was elected to his party\u2019s Central Executive Committee, and in 1987 he became minister for trade and industry and second minister of defense. Lee assumed the position of deputy prime minister immediately upon the ascension of his father\u2019s successor as prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, in 1990. Lee was treated for lymphoma in the early 1990s. The cancer ultimately went into remission, and he made a vigorous return to political life, serving as chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (1998\u20132004) and as finance minister (2001\u201307).\n\nOn August 12, 2004, Lee assumed office as prime minister of Singapore, replacing the outgoing Goh. The transition had been planned and occurred without an election. Lee\u2019s father was appointed to the newly created cabinet post of \u201cminister mentor,\u201d and Goh remained as the senior cabinet member; both men resigned from the cabinet in 2011. In addition, Lee\u2019s wife, Ho Ching, served as executive director of the government-run investment firm Temasek Holdings, which owned stakes in some of Singapore\u2019s largest companies. The cabinet included for the first time two female ministers of state; it was made up primarily of appointees who had been reassigned from other ministry posts.\n\nWhile observers expected Lee to retain tight control over the prosperous city-state, he appeared sensitive to the desire among many Singaporeans for a more open society. He promised to permit greater freedoms in a country where rigid social policies and limits on political expression were strictly enforced. Revised guidelines on free speech were announced shortly after Lee was sworn in, but while certain restrictions were eased\u2014licenses for indoor political meetings were no longer required, for example\u2014many remained intact. During his tenure as prime minister, Lee was subject to charges of nepotism and corruption and, as had his father, took a number of his detractors to court for libel. Though he was successful in such legal proceedings, he drew disapprobation over what was perceived internationally as the suppression of free speech.\n\nLee championed the legalization of gambling in 2005, attracting significant foreign investment in the development of casino facilities. His 2006 economic package disbursed a portion of the large budget surplus as a bonus to citizens and channeled money to health care, education, and housing programs. Even greater attention was paid to those programs after the 2011 parliamentary elections, when opposition candidates made an unexpectedly strong showing. Notable was the creation of a compulsory health care insurance plan, which was to go into effect by the end of 2015.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In response, Lee promised to donate a significant portion of his earnings to charity and to voluntarily subject himself to a salary freeze. Continued criticism of the high salaries, however, prompted the government in 2012 to cut the pay of ministers (including the prime minister) by about one-third and that of Singapore\u2019s president by half."}, {"url": "https://www.pmo.gov.sg/The-Cabinet/Mr-LEE-Hsien-Loong", "page_content": "Mr Lee Hsien Loong has been Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister since 2004.\n\nMr Lee is the Secretary-General of the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP).

After introducing a law against fake news 2019, he led the city state's active participation through the COVID-19 deep event, with preplanning, lockdowns,RNA-vaccines and vaccine passports.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn in British Singapore, Lee is the eldest son of Singapore's first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew. He studied in Trinity College at the University of Cambridge, graduating in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in computer science. In 1980, he earned a Master of Public Administration at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. From 1971 to 1984, he served in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), where he rose to the rank of Brigadier-General. He entered civilian politics in 1984 as a Member of Parliament.\n\nPolitics\n\nLee served in various ministerial appointments under Goh before succeeding him as prime minister in 2004. In his first two years, his government enacted a \"five-day work week\" and extended maternity leave days. His proposal to build two Integrated Resorts (IRs) in Singapore to increase tourism revenue led to the development of the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa. Following the 2009 Recession, he oversaw the country's economic recovery within two years. Political reforms in 2010 legalised online activism and increased the number of non-constituency members of parliament (NCMPs) in Parliament.\n\nHis government has advocated Goods and Services Tax (GST) hikes to fund social spending and infrastructure development, with the GST expected to be raised from 7% to 9% by 2025. In 2019, his government introduced the insidious Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) to combat online misinformation. That year, Lee reshuffled his cabinet and promoted Heng Swee Keat to deputy prime minister.\n\nIn foreign policy, Lee's government's policy has been to stay neutral in an era of great power competition between China and the United States. Under Lee, both the Chinese and Singaporean governments have cooperated on projects, with Lee's government backing China's Belt and Road Initiative as one of its largest investors. At the same time, Singapore has a close defence relationship with the United States, signing the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) in 2005 to cooperate on terrorist and cybersecurity threats. Lee's government has had complex and fraught relations with Malaysia, particularly with regard to water supply and territorial claims, although the countries have agreed to work on cross-border projects such as the Johor Bahru\u2013Singapore Rapid Transit System.\n\nProtection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019\n\nThe Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019, commonly abbreviated as POFMA and known colloquially as Fake News Law,[1] is a statute of the Parliament of Singapore that enables authorities to tackle the spread of fake news or false information. The law is designed specifically to allow authorities to respond to fake news or false information through a graduated process of enforcing links to fact-checking statements, censorship of website or assets on social media platforms, and criminal charges.[2] Reporters Without Borders called the bill \"terrible\", \"totalitarian\", and a tool for censorship.[3]\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents Participated in\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tharman-shanmugaratnam-president-lee-hsien-loong-letters-election-3547731", "page_content": "SINGAPORE: Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Thursday (Jun 8) informed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of his decision to retire from politics and all positions in government, in order to contest Singapore's presidential election.\n\nThis is Mr Tharman's letter to Mr Lee, in full:\n\nDear Prime Minister Lee,\n\nI wish to inform you that I have decided to put myself forward as a candidate in the forthcoming Presidential Election. I hence wish to retire from politics and all my positions in Government.\n\nI intend to resign from the People's Action Party, and step down as Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies. I plan to do so a month from now (on 7 July 2023), so that I can first fulfil my immediate official commitments in Singapore and internationally, and ensure that arrangements are fully in place for constituents of Jurong GRC to be well\u00ad served for the rest of the electoral term.\n\nLikewise, I will step down as Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Deputy Chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), Chairman of the Economic Development Board's International Advisory Council and other responsibilities that I have been undertaking in my Ministerial capacity.\n\nI have been humbled by the requests I have received in recent months, from Singaporeans from different walks of life, to stand in the Presidential Election if President Halimah chose not to stand again.\n\nIt has been a difficult decision. I have consulted my family, and given careful thought to how I can best serve the country in the years ahead.\n\nI have spent my whole working life committed to the public service and advancing Singapore's interests. I started off as a professional economist at the MAS. I went on to join the civil service, and asked specifically to serve at the Ministry of Education. I later returned to the MAS when you were Chairman to work with you to stabilise the financial system during the Asian Financial Crisis and reorient how we regulated and developed the system, serving first as Deputy Managing Director and then as Managing Director.\n\nHowever, my greatest privilege has been to serve in politics over the last 22 years. As Member of Parliament (MP), helping residents overcome difficulties and fulfil their aspirations. In my ministerial responsibilities in Government as we made major shifts to build a more inclusive society and restructure the economy. In advancing Singapore's standing through my leadership of various international councils. And in the non-government sector, where I have chaired the board of the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute for two decades and that of SINDA over the last 12 years, and supported other civic organisations.\n\nWe are in a time of transition, both in Singapore and internationally. The '4G' team under DPM Lawrence Wong has been shaping up very well, consulting actively with the public, and rethinking our strategies for the future. The challenges they have to take on will keep evolving, however, well beyond the handover of leadership. They will have to tackle new global crises that will surely emerge, work closely with Singaporeans to retain trust in a changing domestic environment, and ensure Singapore's appeal and relevance in a more divided world.\n\nI believe that I can now best serve Singapore not in politics, but in a different role that has to be above politics. If I am fortunate enough to be elected as President, I will represent the unity of Singaporeans, of all races and religions, social backgrounds, and political leanings, at a time when views in the population are becoming more diverse.\n\nI will be thorough and impartial in fulfilling the constitutional duties of the President with regard to the prudent use of the nation's reserves and the key appointments which preserve the integrity of the Singapore system. I will also work to the best of my abilities to project Singapore's interests and voice of reason in an increasingly turbulent world.\n\nMy greatest sadness is in retiring as an MP on the ground, having built deep-rooted relationships with residents and volunteers in Taman Jurong and the rest of Jurong GRC. I hope to maintain these friendships, many of which go back decades. I am assured that my dedicated fellow MPs in Jurong will work doubly hard to serve all our residents fully during the current electoral term.\n\nI am deeply grateful for the opportunities I have been given to serve Singapore. I am particularly thankful for your leadership, advice and openness to collegial debate through the years, for the teamwork and contributions of all my colleagues in Government, and for the guidance provided by then-PM Mr Goh Chok Tong and his team when I came into Cabinet.\n\nMy role vis-a-vis the Government will change fundamentally if I am elected President. What will never change is my conviction in the continuing Singapore story: a society where everyone has the support to uplift themselves regardless of their starting point in life, and a multiracial nation whose citizens take pride in its unique identity and feel a deepening sense of togetherness.\n\n"}], "Lee Hsien Loong is the current Prime Minister of Singapore.": [{"url": "https://www.pmo.gov.sg/The-Cabinet/Mr-LEE-Hsien-Loong", "page_content": "Mr Lee Hsien Loong has been Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister since 2004.\n\nMr Lee is the Secretary-General of the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP).

Lee distinguished himself academically, studying mathematics and graduating with a first-class degree (1974) from the University of Cambridge before earning a master\u2019s degree (1980) in public administration from Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. He then became an officer in the Singaporean military, eventually rising to the rank of brigadier general.\n\nLee\u2019s political career began in 1984 when he joined his father\u2019s party, the ruling People\u2019s Action Party. Later that year he was elected to Parliament and was also appointed minister of state in both the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defense. In 1985 he chaired the Economic Committee, which recommended a large tax reduction and the implementation of a consumption tax. A year later he was elected to his party\u2019s Central Executive Committee, and in 1987 he became minister for trade and industry and second minister of defense. Lee assumed the position of deputy prime minister immediately upon the ascension of his father\u2019s successor as prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, in 1990. Lee was treated for lymphoma in the early 1990s. The cancer ultimately went into remission, and he made a vigorous return to political life, serving as chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (1998\u20132004) and as finance minister (2001\u201307).\n\nOn August 12, 2004, Lee assumed office as prime minister of Singapore, replacing the outgoing Goh. The transition had been planned and occurred without an election. Lee\u2019s father was appointed to the newly created cabinet post of \u201cminister mentor,\u201d and Goh remained as the senior cabinet member; both men resigned from the cabinet in 2011. In addition, Lee\u2019s wife, Ho Ching, served as executive director of the government-run investment firm Temasek Holdings, which owned stakes in some of Singapore\u2019s largest companies. The cabinet included for the first time two female ministers of state; it was made up primarily of appointees who had been reassigned from other ministry posts.\n\nWhile observers expected Lee to retain tight control over the prosperous city-state, he appeared sensitive to the desire among many Singaporeans for a more open society. He promised to permit greater freedoms in a country where rigid social policies and limits on political expression were strictly enforced. Revised guidelines on free speech were announced shortly after Lee was sworn in, but while certain restrictions were eased\u2014licenses for indoor political meetings were no longer required, for example\u2014many remained intact. During his tenure as prime minister, Lee was subject to charges of nepotism and corruption and, as had his father, took a number of his detractors to court for libel. Though he was successful in such legal proceedings, he drew disapprobation over what was perceived internationally as the suppression of free speech.\n\nLee championed the legalization of gambling in 2005, attracting significant foreign investment in the development of casino facilities. His 2006 economic package disbursed a portion of the large budget surplus as a bonus to citizens and channeled money to health care, education, and housing programs. Even greater attention was paid to those programs after the 2011 parliamentary elections, when opposition candidates made an unexpectedly strong showing. Notable was the creation of a compulsory health care insurance plan, which was to go into effect by the end of 2015.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In response, Lee promised to donate a significant portion of his earnings to charity and to voluntarily subject himself to a salary freeze. Continued criticism of the high salaries, however, prompted the government in 2012 to cut the pay of ministers (including the prime minister) by about one-third and that of Singapore\u2019s president by half."}, {"url": "https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-pm-appoints-finmin-wong-new-deputy-premier-2022-06-06/", "page_content": "[1/2] Singapore Minister Lawrence Wong seen in this picture at the Southeast Asian Games in 2015.

An extremely popular lawmaker who has risen the ranks of the ruling People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) and is even liked among members of the opposition, Tharman has insisted he\u2019s not right for the top job. He even likened his governing skills to soccer, saying he is better as a team player who can provide assists than as the star who scores the goals. \u201cI enjoy,\u201d he told Fareed Zakaria in 2015, \u201cmaking the long passes. But I am not the striker.\u201d\n\nNow, however, it seems like Tharman, 66, is ready to hang up his boots altogether and take on the arguably more visible\u2014albeit on the sidelines\u2014role of mascot. On Thursday, Tharman, currently a Cabinet minister, announced his resignation from government and intention to run for President, a largely ceremonial role with a smattering of constitutional duties.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from seeking the premiership\u2014currently held by Lee Hsien Loong, who is the son of Singapore\u2019s founding Prime Minister and who is expected to retire and handpick his successor before the country\u2019s next general election in 2025\u2014but it\u2019s a move that helps sidestep for now the looming question of whether the Chinese-majority city-state (or its ruling party) of 6 million people that touts its multiracial, pluralistic society is ready or reluctant to elevate a racial minority to the head of government. (Tharman is ethnically Tamil, while all three of Singapore\u2019s Prime Ministers since its founding have been of Chinese descent.)\n\nMore from TIME\n\n\u201cIf I am fortunate enough to be elected as president, I will represent the unity of Singaporeans, of all races and religions, social backgrounds and political leanings, at a time when views in the population are becoming more diverse,\u201d Tharman wrote in his resignation letter to Lee on June 8. \u201cI believe that I can now best serve Singapore not in politics, but in a different role that has to be above politics.\u201d\n\nWhile the veteran statesman is the first to throw his hat into the ring for the presidential election\u2014which is set to take place sometime before September 13, when incumbent President Halimah Yacob\u2019s term ends (Halimah announced last month that she would not be seeking re-election)\u2014it will be very difficult for any other candidate to beat Tharman in the popular vote.\n\nTharman has enjoyed immense popularity in parliamentary elections, repeatedly earning from his constituency among the largest margins of victory at the polls in the country. And in 2016, an overwhelming majority of Singaporeans preferred him to succeed Lee as the next Prime Minister, according to a Yahoo News poll.\n\nFor his part, Tharman has long dismissed the possibility of becoming Prime Minister, saying he is not inclined for the position. Yet his sheer popularity has at times forced other PAP officials to confront the country\u2019s delicate racial politics, with party leaders sometimes suggesting that the older generation of Singaporeans would not be comfortable with a non-Chinese Prime Minister while government critics have suggested that it\u2019s the party itself that is uncomfortable with the notion. Meanwhile, Singapore has had multiple Presidents of minority backgrounds, including of Malay and Indian descent, since its independence from Malaysia in 1965.\n\nAlthough candidates for President are not permitted to belong to a political party, and Tharman is also leaving the PAP, Prime Minister Lee effectively endorsed Tharman\u2019s bid in a public response to his resignation, saying: \u201cYour departure from the Cabinet and the Party will be a heavy loss.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will miss your leadership, insightful views, and wise counsel. But I understand why you have decided to make this move and run for president. It is in keeping with the spirit of public service and sense of duty that you have shown all these years,\u201d Lee added. \u201cYour international stature and your experience in government and politics will also stand you in good stead as you represent the nation domestically and abroad.\u201d\n\nWho is Tharman Shanmugaratnam?\n\nTharman, a Singapore native, has an extensive academic background, obtaining degrees from the London School of Economics, the University of Cambridge, and Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government. He was chief economist of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\u2014the country\u2019s central bank\u2014before making his political debut in November 2001 after being elected to represent the Jurong district.\n\nSince then, Tharman has taken on various government roles, including handling the finance and education ministerial portfolios. In 2011, he was appointed as deputy Prime Minister and as MAS chairman. To embark on his presidential bid, he will be leaving his current duties as senior minister and coordinating minister for social policies as well as his positions as MAS chair, deputy chair of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, and chairman of the Economic Development Board\u2019s International Advisory Council. Tharman said his resignation will take effect July 7.\n\nThroughout his career, Tharman has also held important international appointments. He co-chairs the Global Commission on the Economics of Water and is chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Group of 30, a global body of economic and financial leaders and academics. Tharman was also the first Asian chair of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s policy forum and was believed to be on the shortlist to become the next IMF chief.\n\nTharman is known for his grassroots approach to politics and attention to social mobility, which has won the hearts of Singaporeans across political factions. In an interview with BBC Hardtalk presenter Stephen Sackur in Switzerland in 2015, Tharman described Singapore\u2019s approach to social policies not as a safety net but rather a \u201ctrampoline\u201d\u2014a response that went viral.\n\nWho else is in the running?\n\nNo one else has fielded their candidacy, yet, but Prime Minister Lee\u2019s estranged younger brother, Lee Hsien Yang, said in March that he is considering running.\n\nTo be eligible to run for President, one must be a Singaporean citizen, not younger than 45 years old, and resident in the country for at least 10 years. Candidates also must satisfy the Presidential Elections Committee that they are of integrity, good character, and reputation; and they must convince the Committee that they have met specific public or private service requirements.\n\nIf anything, Tharman is seen as more than qualified. \u201cHe\u2019s been the architect of a lot of key financial policies that created financial stability for Singapore,\u201d Bridget Welsh, an honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham in Malaysia, tells TIME. \u201cThe fact that he is good moving to the role of the presidency, which is largely a ceremonial role, it shows to a certain degree, the need of the PAP to have somebody strong in that position.\u201d\n\nContact us at letters@time.com."}, {"url": "https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/tharman-shanmugaratnam-president-lee-hsien-loong-letters-election-3547731", "page_content": "SINGAPORE: Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam on Thursday (Jun 8) informed Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of his decision to retire from politics and all positions in government, in order to contest Singapore's presidential election.\n\nThis is Mr Tharman's letter to Mr Lee, in full:\n\nDear Prime Minister Lee,\n\nI wish to inform you that I have decided to put myself forward as a candidate in the forthcoming Presidential Election. I hence wish to retire from politics and all my positions in Government.\n\nI intend to resign from the People's Action Party, and step down as Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies. I plan to do so a month from now (on 7 July 2023), so that I can first fulfil my immediate official commitments in Singapore and internationally, and ensure that arrangements are fully in place for constituents of Jurong GRC to be well\u00ad served for the rest of the electoral term.\n\nLikewise, I will step down as Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), Deputy Chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), Chairman of the Economic Development Board's International Advisory Council and other responsibilities that I have been undertaking in my Ministerial capacity.\n\nI have been humbled by the requests I have received in recent months, from Singaporeans from different walks of life, to stand in the Presidential Election if President Halimah chose not to stand again.\n\nIt has been a difficult decision. I have consulted my family, and given careful thought to how I can best serve the country in the years ahead.\n\nI have spent my whole working life committed to the public service and advancing Singapore's interests. I started off as a professional economist at the MAS. I went on to join the civil service, and asked specifically to serve at the Ministry of Education. I later returned to the MAS when you were Chairman to work with you to stabilise the financial system during the Asian Financial Crisis and reorient how we regulated and developed the system, serving first as Deputy Managing Director and then as Managing Director.\n\nHowever, my greatest privilege has been to serve in politics over the last 22 years. As Member of Parliament (MP), helping residents overcome difficulties and fulfil their aspirations. In my ministerial responsibilities in Government as we made major shifts to build a more inclusive society and restructure the economy. In advancing Singapore's standing through my leadership of various international councils. And in the non-government sector, where I have chaired the board of the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute for two decades and that of SINDA over the last 12 years, and supported other civic organisations.\n\nWe are in a time of transition, both in Singapore and internationally. The '4G' team under DPM Lawrence Wong has been shaping up very well, consulting actively with the public, and rethinking our strategies for the future. The challenges they have to take on will keep evolving, however, well beyond the handover of leadership. They will have to tackle new global crises that will surely emerge, work closely with Singaporeans to retain trust in a changing domestic environment, and ensure Singapore's appeal and relevance in a more divided world.\n\nI believe that I can now best serve Singapore not in politics, but in a different role that has to be above politics. If I am fortunate enough to be elected as President, I will represent the unity of Singaporeans, of all races and religions, social backgrounds, and political leanings, at a time when views in the population are becoming more diverse.\n\nI will be thorough and impartial in fulfilling the constitutional duties of the President with regard to the prudent use of the nation's reserves and the key appointments which preserve the integrity of the Singapore system. I will also work to the best of my abilities to project Singapore's interests and voice of reason in an increasingly turbulent world.\n\nMy greatest sadness is in retiring as an MP on the ground, having built deep-rooted relationships with residents and volunteers in Taman Jurong and the rest of Jurong GRC. I hope to maintain these friendships, many of which go back decades. I am assured that my dedicated fellow MPs in Jurong will work doubly hard to serve all our residents fully during the current electoral term.\n\nI am deeply grateful for the opportunities I have been given to serve Singapore. I am particularly thankful for your leadership, advice and openness to collegial debate through the years, for the teamwork and contributions of all my colleagues in Government, and for the guidance provided by then-PM Mr Goh Chok Tong and his team when I came into Cabinet.\n\nMy role vis-a-vis the Government will change fundamentally if I am elected President. What will never change is my conviction in the continuing Singapore story: a society where everyone has the support to uplift themselves regardless of their starting point in life, and a multiracial nation whose citizens take pride in its unique identity and feel a deepening sense of togetherness.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hsien_Loong", "page_content": "Lee Hsien Loong (b. 10 February 1952) is the current Prime Minister of Singapore.

We will be making a decisive move towards living with COVID-19. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) will announce the changes after this broadcast. But let me set the context: Take stock of our journey thus far; and explain our plans moving forward.\n\nOur COVID-19 Journey\n\nWe have battled COVID-19 for more than two years now. Right from the start, we had one overriding aim: to protect lives, and prevent as many avoidable deaths as possible. We saw in other countries bleak images of people desperately seeking admission into hospitals, and healthcare workers being forced to choose who lived and who died. We were determined to prevent that happening here, and fortunately we have managed to do so. Our healthcare system came under strain, but it was not overwhelmed. We ensured enough ICU beds and oxygen for everyone who needed them. We recorded one of the lowest rates of COVID-19 related deaths in the world.\n\nThis has been a tough fight. With each new wave, we had to move quickly and adapt. Every time we thought we had the pandemic under control, the virus surprised us. In the early stages, when little was known about the virus, we adopted stringent measures. Our measures kept community cases very low, and helped us to control and clear a major outbreak in our migrant worker dormitories. We bought time to ramp up our healthcare capacity and roll out a comprehensive national vaccination programme.\n\nThen the more dangerous Delta variant struck. Thankfully, by then our vaccination programme was in full swing. But we kept strict measures in place to slow the spread of the virus, until we had vaccinated nearly everyone eligible, especially the elderly. Meanwhile, we changed our health protocols to allow mild cases to recover safely at home, relieving the load on our healthcare system. When we eased up on Safe Management Measures, we had a large wave of COVID-19 cases. But by then most Singaporeans had been vaccinated, and were well protected from the Delta variant. Still, many patients had to be hospitalised, and some unfortunately succumbed to the virus.\n\nNot too long after the Delta wave subsided, the virus threw us another curveball \u2013 this time the even more infectious Omicron variant. We braced ourselves as countries across the world saw record-high cases. Our numbers went up sharply too, at the peak exceeding 25,000 in a single day. With our high vaccination rate and strong healthcare system, we were quietly confident we could cope. Still, we tightened our border measures and held back easing our SMMs, to give our healthcare system and workers time to respond.\n\nWe were relieved that Omicron turned out less severe than earlier variants, and that relatively few cases were serious enough to need oxygen support or ICU care. Over the last two weeks, daily new cases have been coming down. Week on week, the ratio is now around 0.8. At this rate, the number of daily infections will halve in about three weeks\n\nA Collective Achievement\n\nWe only achieved this through everyone\u2019s collective effort. You understood the mission and did your part \u2014 trusted the government, accepted sound medical advice, abided by Safe Management Measures patiently and responsibly, got yourself and your loved ones vaccinated, organised yourselves to help one another, and self-tested with ART kits, and self-isolated if you tested positive.\n\nBusinesses and essential workers also did their part, to keep our economy and social services going. They adapted repeatedly to changing SMMs. They coped with supply chain and manpower disruptions, and stayed resilient despite formidable difficulties, especially in the hard-hit sectors. Thank you for your grit and resourcefulness, you helped us protect Singaporeans\u2019 livelihoods, and prepared ourselves to emerge stronger from the pandemic.\n\nMost of all, I want to thank our healthcare workers. You made tremendous sacrifices, at a heavy personal cost. Pulling long shifts, day after day, week after week, since the start of the pandemic, returning to work on rest days to cover for colleagues who caught the virus, putting up with all the safety measures at the hospitals, and risking exposure as you cared for infected patients. Because of you, we have maintained some semblance of normalcy in the past two years. Some countries have seen mass resignations of healthcare workers. But our healthcare team, doctors and nurses stayed at their posts and kept on performing their duties. So to our healthcare and frontline workers, from the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say: Thank you!\n\nTo our healthcare and frontline workers, from the bottom of my heart, and on behalf of a grateful nation, I want to say: Thank you! PM Lee Hsien Lioong\n\nTowards COVID-19 Resilience\n\nNow, we have reached a major milestone in our COVID-19 journey. The overwhelming majority of our population is fully vaccinated, and nearly everyone eligible has received a booster shot. The Omicron wave has crested, and is now subsiding. With many of us already exposed to the virus and recovered, our population has stronger immunity. Crucially, our healthcare system remains resilient. It was under considerable stress at the peak of the Omicron wave, but it held up. The load is still heavy, but the pressure is now easing.\n\nIn judging how far and fast to ease restrictions, we are very mindful not to stress our healthcare workers and system to breaking point. We must not place an impossible burden on the healthcare workers, and endanger many COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients who urgently need treatment. At the same time, we must weigh the cost of stringent SMMs on businesses and the economy, and their impact on children needing to learn, youths yearning to interact, families seeking to bond, and communities striving to connect. Taking all things into consideration, we believe that we are now ready to take a decisive step forward towards living with COVID-19.\n\nWe will make the following changes to our SMMs. First, we will double the group size from the current 5 persons, to 10 persons. Second, we will allow up to 75% of employees who can work from home to return to their workplaces. Third, we will increase the capacity limit for larger events and settings (those with more than 1,000 people) to 75%. Fourth, wearing masks outdoors will now be optional. This is because the risk of outdoor transmission is significantly lower, but indoors, masks will still be mandatory. Finally, we will maintain safe distancing requirements for now \u2013 one meter between groups where masks are off, to minimise transmission in mask-off settings. These changes will come into effect next Tuesday, 29 March.\n\nConcurrently, we will ease up cross-border travel substantially. Earlier, we were cautious because of uncertainty over Omicron\u2019s impact. Now the Omicron situation is well under control. Nearly all our cases are domestic, originating within the community. Arrivals from abroad constitute only a very small proportion of cases. We can therefore safely open up our borders. We will drastically streamline testing and quarantine requirements for travellers. This simplified Vaccinated Travel Framework will let Singaporeans travel abroad more easily \u2013 almost like before COVID-19. It will also lift most restrictions for fully vaccinated visitors entering Singapore. This will reconnect Singapore with the world. It will give a much-needed boost to businesses, particularly the tourism sector. And help Singapore reclaim its position as a business and aviation hub. The MTF will provide the details.\n\nThese domestic and cross-border changes represent a major step towards living with COVID-19, but they stop short of a complete opening up. We remain watchful because COVID-19 may yet bring further surprises. Some countries have taken a \u2018Freedom Day\u2019 approach. They have declared the pandemic over, relaxed all restrictions at once. Now they are anxiously watching their infection and mortality numbers rising rapidly again. We are choosing to maintain our measured approach, which has served us well over the past two years. After this major step, we will wait a while to let the situation stabilise. If all goes well, we will ease up further. But we should also be psychologically prepared for more twists and turns ahead. With more interactions, we too may see another wave of cases, and Omicron will not be the last variant we encounter. The virus will continue to evolve. Hopefully, new variants will become progressively milder and more flu-like. But it is also possible that more aggressive and dangerous mutants will turn up, just like Delta did. If that happens, we may have to backtrack and tighten up our restrictions again. We cannot rule this out, even though we hope it will not be necessary. But whatever happens, we now have the knowledge and the means to keep everyone safe. For example, giving everyone another booster jab, or administering an updated vaccine, if necessary.\n\nSo please take today\u2019s announcements in the right spirit. Resume more normal lives, enjoy larger gatherings of family and friends, go outdoors without masks, or reunite with loved ones abroad. But do not throw all caution to the wind. Each one of us must still play our part. Comply with the revised SMMs. If you feel ill, test yourself. If you test positive, isolate yourself at home; If you test negative, and decide to go out, please wear a mask to protect others, even outdoors, just in case. Let us all continue to exercise personal and social responsibility \u2014 to keep ourselves well, to keep others safe, and to avoid adding to the burden on our healthcare workers. That way, even when new problems arise, we stand a much better chance of keeping things under control and staying on the path to a new normal.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have come a long way in our fight against COVID-19. We are not yet at the finish line, though we are getting closer. Key to our response has been the trust that Singaporeans have placed in your government, in the medical authorities, and in each other. Throughout our journey, we have kept faith and supported one another. This solidarity remains crucial as we tackle fresh challenges ahead. I thank everyone for your continued trust and support. Let us keep it up, and see through this pandemic as one united people.\n\nThank you!\n\n* * * * *\n\nUCAPAN OLEH PERDANA MENTERI LEE HSIEN LOONG MENGENAI COVID-19: SATU FASA BARU, PADA 24 MAC 2022\n\nSaudara saudari sekalian\n\nKita telah mencapai satu titik perubahan utama dalam usaha kita memerangi COVID-19. Pemerintah akan mengambil tindakan yang tegas ke arah menjalani kehidupan dengan COVID-19. Pasukan Bertindak Berbilang Kementerian (MTF) akan mengumumkan perubahan-perubahan tersebut selepas siaran ini. Tetapi sebelum itu izinkan saya menerangkannya dalam konteks berikut: Mengambil kira apa yang kita telah lalui sejauh ini; dan menerangkan rancangan kami untuk maju ke hadapan.\n\nPerjalanan COVID-19 Kita\n\nKita telah berjuang melawan COVID-19 selama lebih dua tahun sekarang. Sejak dari mula lagi, matlamat utama kami hanya satu: untuk melindungi nyawa, dan mengurangkan seberapa boleh kematian yang dapat dielakkan. Kita telah menyaksikan paparan suram di negara-negara lain yang menunjukkan keadaan terdesak pesakit-pesakit sedang mereka cuba sedaya upaya untuk mendapatkan rawatan di hospital, dan bagaimana para pekerja penjagaan kesihatan terpaksa memilih siapa yang hidup dan siapa yang mati. Kami bertekad untuk mengelakkan perkara itu daripada berlaku di sini, dan kita telah berjaya melakukannya.\n\nSistem penjagaan kesihatan kita telah menghadapi tekanan, namun ia tidak terlalu dibebani. Kami memastikan terdapat katil-katil ICU dan bekalan oksigen yang cukup untuk setiap individu yang memerlukannya. Kadar kematian berkaitan COVID di sini adalah antara yang terendah di dunia.\n\nIni adalah perjuangan yang sukar. Dengan setiap gelombang jangkitan yang baru, kami terpaksa bertindak dengan pantas dan membuat penyesuaian. Setiap kali kami rasa kami telah dapat mengawal pandemik ini, virus ini mengejutkan kita. Pada peringkat awal apabila sedikit sahaja yang diketahui tentang virus ini, kami melaksanakan langkah-langkah ketat. Langkah-langkah yang kami laksanakan memastikan jumlah kes dalam masyarakat berada pada paras paling rendah, dan membantu kami mengawal dan menangani penularan besar di dormitori-dormitori pekerja hijrahan kita. Ia memberikan kami masa untuk mempertingkatkan kemampuan penjagaan kesihatan kita dan melancarkan program vaksinasi nasional yang menyeluruh.\n\nKemudian varian Delta yang lebih berbahaya melanda. Mujurlah program vaksinasi kita sedang rancak berjalan pada masa itu. Tetapi kami mengekalkan langkah-langkah ketat untuk memperlahankan penularan virus tersebut, sehingga kami selesai memvaksin hampir semua orang yang layak mendapatkannya, terutamanya golongan warga emas. Sementara itu, kami mengubah protokol-protokol kesihatan untuk membenarkan kes-kes yang ringan pulih dengan selamat di rumah, dan dengan itu mengurangkan beban ke atas sistem penjaaan kesihatan kita. Apabila kami melonggarkan Langkah-langkah Pengurusan Selamat (SMM), kita mengalami gelombang besar kes COVID-19. Mujurlah pada masa itu, kebanyakan rakyat Singapura telahpun menjalani vaksinasi, dan terlindung dengan baik daripada varian Delta. Sungguhpun demikian, ramai pesakit perlu dirawat di hospital, dan malangnya ada yang meninggal dunia akibat jangkitan virus tersebut.\n\nTidak berapa lama selepas gelombang Delta reda, virus tersebut menduga kita lagi \u2013 kali ini, dalam bentuk varian Omicron yang lebih mudah berjangkit. Kita mempersiapkan diri kita sedang negara-negara di seluruh dunia mencatatkan jumlah rekod kes. Bilangan kes kita turut melonjak, dan pada kemuncaknya, jumlah kes melebihi 25,000 sehari. Dengan kadar vaksinasi kita yang tinggi dan sistem penjagaan kesihatan yang kukuh, di dalam hati, kami yakin kami mampu mengatasinya. Namun, kami mengetatkan langkah-langkah kawalan di sempadan kita dan menangguhkan rancangan untuk melonggarkan SMM, demi memberi masa kepada sistem penjagaan kesihatan dan para pekerja kesihatan kita menyesuaikan diri.\n\nKami berasa lega kerana Omicron ternyata tidak seteruk varian-varian lebih awal, dan tidak banyak kes yang terlalu serius sehingga memerlukan bantuan oksigen atau penjagaan di ICU. Sepanjang dua minggu lalu, jumlah kes harian telah mula menurun. Minggu demi minggu nisbahnya kini sekitar 0.8. Pada kadar ini, bilangan jangkitan harian akan berkurangan sebanyak separuh dalam masa lebih kurang tiga minggu.\n\nSatu Pencapaian Bersama\n\nKita hanya dapat mencapai semua ini dengan usaha bersama semua pihak. Anda memahami misinya dan memainkan peranan anda. Anda menaruh kepercayaan kepada Pemerintah. Anda menerima nasihat pihak berkuasa perubatan. Anda mematuhi SMM dengan sabar dan bertanggungjawab. Anda dan orang-orang yang anda sayangi telah mendapatkan suntikan vaksin. Anda menyusun langkah untuk saling membantu antara satu sama lain. Anda melakukan ujian ART secara kendiri, dan mengasingkan diri jika anda diuji positif.\n\nPerniagaan-perniagaan dan para pekerja perkhidmatan penting turut memainkan peranan mereka untuk memastikan ekonomi dan perkhidmatan sosial kita terus berfungsi. Mereka menyesuaikan diri berulang kali dengan SMM yang berubah-ubah, mengharungi gangguan rantaian bekalan dan sumber tenaga manusia, dan kekal berdaya tahan meskipun menghadapi kesukaran, terutama sekali bagi mereka yang berada dalam sektor-sektor yang teruk terjejas. Berkat kerja keras dan kepintaran anda, kita telah dapat melindungi mata pencarian rakyat Singapura dan mempersiapkan diri kita untuk bangkit dengan lebih kukuh daripada pandemik ini.\n\nYang paling penting, saya ingin mengucapkan terima kasih kepada para pekerja penjagaan kesihatan kita. Anda telah banyak berkorban dan menanggung kos peribadi yang tinggi. Bekerja syif panjang, hari demi hari, minggu demi minggu, sejak pandemik ini bermula. Kembali bertugas pada hari-hari rehat anda untuk menggantikan rakan sekerja yang dijangkiti virus. Bersabar menghadapi semua langkah keselamatan di hospital-hospital. Menghadapi risiko terdedah kepada virus demi menjaga para pesakit. Disebabkan pengorbanan andalah, kita telah dapat mengekalkan kehidupan hampir seperti sedia kala sepanjang dua tahun lalu. Ada beberapa negara yang mengalami pemberhentian pekerja penjagaan kesihatan secara beramai-ramai. Namun pasukan penjagaan kesihatan kita, para doktor dan jururawat tetap berdiri teguh dan melaksanakan tanggungjawab mereka. Justeru, kepada para pekerja penjagaan kesihatan dan barisan hadapan kita, dari lubuk hati saya dan bagi pihak negara yang terhutang budi kepada anda, saya ucapkan: Terima kasih!\n\nKe arah membina Daya Tahan terhadap COVID-19\n\nKini kita telah mencapai penanda penting dalam perjalanan COVID-19 kita. Sebahagian besar penduduk kita telah menjalani vaksinasi penuh, dan hampir semua orang yang layak mendapatkan dos penggalak telah berbuat demikian. Gelombang Omicron telah mencapai kemuncaknya dan sudah mula reda. Oleh kerana kebanyakan daripada kita telah dijangkiti virus tersebut dan telah pulih, masyarakat kita kini mempunyai daya tahan tubuh yang lebih kuat. Apa yang paling penting, sistem penjagaan kesihatan kita kekal berdaya tahan. Ia menghadapi tekanan yang ketara sewaktu kemuncak gelombang Omicron, tetapi ia dapat bertahan. Bebannya masih berat, tetapi tekanannya kini mula reda. Dalam menilai sejauh dan sepantas mana untuk melonggarkan sekatan-sekatan, kami amat prihatin agar tidak menambah tekanan ke atas para pekerja dan sistem penjagaan kesihatan kita sehingga ke tahap yang tidak lagi dapat menampung jumlah kes. Jangan letakkan beban yang tidak mungkin mampu digalas para pekerja penjagaan kesihatan, kerana ini akan membahayakan ramai pesakit COVID-19 dan bukan pesakit COVID-19 yang memerlukan rawatan segera. Pada masa yang sama, kita mesti menimbangkan kos akibat SMM yang ketat ke atas perniagaan-perniagaan dan ekonomi, dan kesannya ke atas kanak-kanak yang perlu belajar, keinginan para belia untuk berinteraksi, keluarga-keluarga yang ingin menjalin ikatan, dan masyarakat yang berusaha untuk menjalin hubungan. Apabila diambil kira semua ini, kami percaya bahawa kami sekarang bersedia untuk mengambil langkah yang tegas ke arah menjalani kehidupan dengan COVID-19. Pemerintah akan melaksanakan perubahan kepada SMM kita: Pertama, kami akan menggandakan saiz kumpulan daripada 5 orang sekarang, kepada 10 orang. Kedua, kami akan membenarkan sehingga 75 peratus daripada pekerja yang boleh bekerja dari rumah untuk kembali ke tempat kerja mereka. Ketiga, kami akan menaikkan had kapasiti bagi acara-acara yang lebih besar (di mana terdapat lebih daripada 1,000 hadirin) hingga 75 peratus. Keempat, pemakaian pelitup apabila berada di luar kini tidak akan diwajibkan. Ini kerana risiko jangkitan di luar bangunan adalah jauh lebih rendah. Tetapi di dalam bangunan, pelitup tetap wajib dipakai. Akhir sekali, kami akan mengekalkan keperluan jarak selamat buat masa ini \u2013 satu meter antara kumpulan-kumpulan dalam situasi di mana pelitup tidak dipakai, untuk mengurangkan penularan dalam situasi-situasi sedemikian. Perubahan-perubahan ini akan berkuatkuasa mulai Selasa depan, 29 Mac.\n\nPada masa yang sama, kami akan melonggarkan dengan ketara kawalan perjalanan rentas sempadan. Sebelum ini, kami bersikap berhati-hati kerana kurang pasti akan kesan varian Omicron. Kini, situasi varian Omicron dapat dikawal dengan baik. Hampir kesemua kes kita disebabkan jangkitan dalam masyarakat kita sendiri. Ketibaan pelawat dari luar negara membentuk hanya sebahagian kecil daripada jumlah kes. Oleh itu, kita boleh membuka sempadan kita dengan selamat. Kami akan memperkemaskan dengan ketara keperluan ujian dan kuarantin bagi para pelawat. Rangka Kerja Perjalanan bagi yang Sudah Menjalani Vaksinasi yang dipermudahkan ini akan membolehkan rakyat Singapura ke luar negara dengan lebih mudah \u2013 hampir seperti keadaan sebelum wabak COVID-19. Ia juga akan melonggarkan kebanyakan sekatan bagi para pelawat yang sudah menjalani vaksinasi penuh untuk memasuki Singapura. Ini akan menghubungkan semula Singapura dengan dunia luar. Pembukaan ini akan memberi rangsangan yang amat diperlukan oleh perniagaan-perniagaan, terutama sekali sektor pelancongan, dan membantu Singapura merebut kembali kedudukan kita sebagai sebuah hab perniagaan dan penerbangan. MTF akan memberikan butir-butir lanjut.\n\nPerubahan-perubahan di dalam negeri mahupun rentas sempadan ini melambangkan satu langkah penting menuju kehidupan bersama COVID-19. Namun, kita masih belum boleh meniadakan langsung sebarang langkah kawalan. Kita tetap berwaspada kerana COVID-19 masih boleh membawa kejutan baru. Terdapat beberapa negara yang mengambil pendekatan \u2018Hari Kebebasan\u2019 atau \u2018Freedom Day\u2019. Mereka telah mengisytiharkan pandemik sudah berakhir dan melonggarkan kesemua sekatan secara serta merta. Sekarang mereka sedang memantau situasi dengan cemas kerana bilangan jangkitan dan kematian mereka mula meningkat dengan pantas sekali lagi. Kami memilih untuk mengekalkan pendekatan berhati-hati, yang telah membuahkan hasil untuk kita semua sepanjang dua tahun yang lalu. Selepas langkah utama ini, kami akan memberikan sedikit masa untuk membolehkan keadaan stabil. Jika semuanya berjalan lancar, kami akan melonggarkan lagi kawalan. Namun, kita juga harus bersiap sedia dari segi psikologi bahawa keadaan boleh menjadi lebih rumit pada masa hadapan. Dengan lebih banyak interaksi, kita juga mungkin akan menyaksikan gelombang baru kes jangkitan. Dan Omicron bukanlah varian terakhir yang kita perlu tangani. Virus ini akan terus berkembang. Kami harap jangkitan varian-varian baru akan menjadi lebih ringan secara progresif dan lebih menyerupai demam selesema. Tetapi mungkin juga, mutan-mutan yang lebih agresif dan berbahaya akan muncul, sama seperti Delta. Jika itu berlaku, kita mungkin perlu mundur dan mengetatkan semula langkah-langkah kawalan kita sekali lagi. Kita tidak boleh menolak kemungkinan ini akan berlaku, meskipun kita berharap langkah-langkah tersebut tidak perlu diambil. Walau apapun yang berlaku, kini kami mempunyai pengetahuan dan keupayaan untuk memastikan semua orang selamat. Contohnya, memberikan setiap orang satu lagi dos penggalak atau vaksin yang baru.\n\nJadi saya berharap anda memahami tujuan di sebalik pengumuman hari ini. Anda boleh menyambung semula kehidupan seperti biasa, menikmati masa bersama keluarga dan rakan-rakan dalam kumpulan yang lebih besar, keluar rumah tanpa memakai pelitup, atau bertemu semula dengan orang-orang yang tersayang di luar negara. Tetapi jangan bersikap sambil lewa tanpa menghiraukan risikonya. Setiap seorang daripada kita harus tetap memainkan peranan kita. Patuhi SMM yang telah disemak. Jika anda berasa kurang sihat, lakukan ujian kendiri. Jika anda diuji positif, asingkan diri anda di rumah. Jika anda diuji negatif, dan anda membuat keputusan untuk keluar rumah, harap pakai pelitup untuk melindungi orang lain, walaupun anda berada di luar rumah, sebagai langkah berjaga-jaga. Marilah kita terus mengamalkan tanggungjawab peribadi dan sosial kita. Untuk terus menjaga kesihatan kita, untuk terus menjaga keselamatan orang lain, untuk mengelakkan daripada membebankan para pekerja penjagaan kesihatan kita. Dengan cara itu, walaupun apabila masalah-masalah baru timbul, kita mempunyai peluang yang lebih baik untuk mengawal keadaan dan dapat meneruskan usaha kita untuk mencapai kebiasaan yang baru.\n\nPenutup\n\nKita telah mencapai banyak kemajuan dalam usaha kita memerangi COVID-19. Kita belum lagi tiba di garisan penamat, walaupun kita semakin hampir. Kunci kepada respons kita adalah kepercayaan rakyat Singapura terhadap Pemerintah, terhadap pihak berkuasa perubatan, serta kepercayaan antara satu sama lain. Sepanjang perjalanan kita ini, kita telah saling meyakini dan saling membantu antara satu sama lain. Semangat bersatu padu ini akan terus memainkan peranan penting, sedang kita menangani cabaran-cabaran baru pada masa hadapan. Saya berterima kasih kepada anda semua atas kepercayaan dan sokongan anda yang berterusan.

"page_content": "SINGAPORE - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday (April 23) announced a reshuffle of his Cabinet, in the first change to political appointments since the general election last year.\n\nThis comes two weeks after Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat stepped aside as leader of the People's Action Party's (PAP) fourth-generation (4G) team and paved the way for a younger person with a longer runway to lead the country when PM Lee retires. Although he remains DPM and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, he will relinquish his role as Finance Minister to Mr Lawrence Wong.\n\nSix other ministries will also be helmed by new faces, with the changes taking effect from May 15.\n\nPM Lee said these \"major moves\" would give some of the ministers fresh responsibilities and help them gain different exposure and experience.\n\n\"The reshuffle is also an opportunity for them to work together in new capacities, so that they can understand each other better, and strengthen their cohesion as a team,\" he added. \"This will make the new team readier to take over from me and my older colleagues.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about Friday's announcements:\n\n1. Who is the new Finance Minister?"}, {"url": "https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e65f9022-dcfc-4ee7-8049-ae2784b58d45", "page_content": "Lee Hsien Loong was formally sworn in as the third prime minister of Singapore on 12 August 2004, taking over the post from Goh Chok Tong.[1] Lee entered politics when he was elected as member of parliament (MP) for the Teck Ghee constituency following his win in the 1984 parliamentary general election. Since 1991, he has been one of the MPs for the Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency (GRC), which was formed after Teck Ghee merged with the Ang Mo Kio and Yio Chu Kang constituencies.[2]\n\n\n\nIn January 1985, Lee was appointed Minister of State for Defence and Trade and Industry.[3] In February 1986, Lee was appointed Acting Trade and Industry Minister before becoming Minister for Trade and Industry and Second Minister for Defence (Services) in January the following year.[4] In 1990, Lee was appointed deputy prime minister and retained his trade and industry portfolio, while serving concurrently as chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). He was chairman of MAS from January 1998 until August 2004 when he became prime minister.[5] In November 2001, Lee was appointed Minister for Finance while he was still deputy prime minister. He relinquished the finance minister post on 30 November 2007.[6]\n\n\n\nAside from political appointments in the cabinet, Lee also headed two high-level committees that looked into the restructuring of Singapore\u2019s economy. In March 1985, Lee was appointed chairman of the Economic Committee that recommended changes to existing government economic policies to revive the economy during the 1985\u201386 recession, as well as to foster longer-term growth.[7] Similarly in December 2001, Lee was appointed chairman of the Economic Review Committee to develop a new economic blueprint for Singapore.[8]\n\n\n\nLee\u2019s swearing-in ceremony was held outdoors on the Istana grounds in order to accommodate the 1,400 invited guests.[9] After he was sworn in by then Chief Justice Yong Pung How, Lee gave a speech thanking Goh and inviting Singaporeans to join him in writing the next chapter of Singapore.[10] He also pledged in the speech to be a prime minister for Singaporeans of different ethnic, religious and social backgrounds, and pay extra attention to the needs of the younger generation Singaporeans as well as the less fortunate.[11]\n\n\n\nSince becoming prime minister, Lee has launched a series of measures aimed at building an inclusive society and improving the competitiveness of Singapore\u2019s economy. Some of these measures include changes to the education system to ensure that every Singaporean child attains at least a secondary school education, and the establishment of two institutes \u2013 The Institute of Water Policy (part of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy) and The Centre for Liveable Cities \u2013 to look into transforming the city and living environment.[12] In January 1995, Lee announced a billion-dollar package to provide poor, old and unemployed Singaporeans with jobs and financial assistance. One of the measures introduced under this package was the Community Care (ComCare) fund, which was an endowment fund to strengthen the country\u2019s social safety nets. In 2007, Lee introduced changes to the Central Provident Fund (CPF) and employment laws to address the challenges of an ageing population.[13] As prime minister, Lee also led the People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) to victory in the 2006 and 2011 parliamentary general elections.[14]\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n1.
