During this time period, the Steelers compiled a 100-60-2 record.\n\nPersonal Information\n\nSmith was born on Monday, September 7, 1953 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nHistory\n\nCoach history guide"}, {"url": "https://newpittsburghcourier.com/2022/06/18/couriers-aubrey-bruce-speaks-one-on-one-with-longtime-coach/", "page_content": "Courier\u2019s Aubrey Bruce speaks one-on-one with longtime coach\n\nby Aubrey Bruce, For New Pittsburgh Courier\n\nOn the next-to-last day of the Steelers\u2019 2022 \u201cOTAs\u201d (Organized Team Activities), I chatted with Steelers Special Teams Coach Danny Smith. The enthusiastic and fiery personality of Smith has always caused me to smile and think about two other NFL coaches. The first is former Philadelphia Eagles and St. Louis Rams Head Coach Dick Vermeil. The other is current Seattle Seahawks Head Coach Pete Carroll. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I neglected to mention that both of those gentlemen have a Lombardi Trophy residing at the center of their trophy cases. That common denominator seems to bode well for Danny Smith.\n\nAt the beginning of our conversation, I mentioned that special teams could be a positive or negative component on any NFL team in terms of the year-by-year performance of the players assigned to special teams. Smith pointed out that: \u201cIt can be a hard evaluation process, especially for new players coming out of college, because college punt coverage is different than NFL punt coverage.\u201d\n\nHe continues on: \u201cThe footwork, the assignments and the rules of coverage. They\u2019re a lot different in college, so when you get young guys coming in trying to transition to the NFL, they\u2019re trying hard but they\u2019re just working at what they were taught.\u201d\n\nAlthough many special teamers may be destined for future NFL stardom, Smith says that there is a time-honored process that determines what first-year players or any other players will be placed on special teams. \u201cThose decisions are made after a long training camp and the three preseason games that we play. That is where our evaluation process has an advantage over colleges. Sorting (through) some of that stuff is not the part that\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s teaching them the skill set. Carrying out the details of an assignment at this level sometimes can be difficult. Teams in the NFL have great reputations: not only for special teams that can provide a spark for their offense but for their defense as well.\u201d\n\nWe also talked about the occasions that may dictate that a specific game plan to defend against a star wide receiver for the opposing team that might be back to receive punts or kicks. Smith talked about when the offense of the Black and Gold is set to receive the ball and how game plans are created to neutralize an opposing team\u2019s defensive standout that can potentially break up your blocking wedge at best, creating poor field position or at the very worst, create a turnover for the opposition. \u201cIt\u2019s about matchups and we have the same stars as they do but the NFL is a game of matchups.\u201d\n\nWhen Danny Smith refers to matchups, a perfect example that comes to mind for me was a 2007 Monday Night Football matchup between the Steelers and Ravens. In that game, James Harrison had a potential Hall of Fame performance. \u201cDeebo\u201d was simply a walking wrecking ball on defense and special teams that will more than likely never be repeated. He recorded 3.5 sacks, six quarterback hits, three forced fumbles and an interception as the Steelers battered the Ravens, 38-7.\n\nWhen I reflect on that Steelers/Ravens game, Danny Smiths words are ringing in my ears in an almost prophetic-like fashion\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s about matchups and we have the same stars and the NFL is a game of matchups\u2026\u201d\n\nWell in this case it was not about matchups because on that fateful Monday night in 2007 at Heinz Field, the Baltimore Ravens could not in any way, shape or form find a matchup to stop James Harrison. The performance by Harrison also possibly provided a shot in the arm for Steelers\u2019 first-year Head Coach Mike Tomlin. When we push the fast forward button, in January of 2013, Tomlin hired Danny Smith as the Steelers\u2019 Special Teams Coordinator. Since he was hired, Smith, with his wisdom and energy, has become the perfect fit for the Steelers.\n\nDanny Smith recognizes and realizes the \u201cguillotine syndrome\u201d associated with being a special teams coach: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to come back on the next play,\u201d he says in a rather matter-of-fact manner. \u201cWhatever happened on the (previous play) has to be corrected, immediately. We have a one-play series and one shot. We\u2019ve been consistent and will continue to be. You\u2019re always looking for the big play. We created a few of them a year ago, but that don\u2019t mean a damn thing about this year.\u201d\n\nDanny Smith is the perfect man for the almost perfect job in the Pittsburgh Steelers coaching hierarchy. Why? Well, because he is not covertly using his job as a springboard or stepping stone to be elevated to a higher coaching position elsewhere. He is satisfied and proud of his coaching performance, as he should be. He is valued and appreciated by the players, the coaches and the fans. As far as the Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 \u201cuniversity of special teams\u201d is concerned, Coach Danny Smith is not striving to be the, \u201cbig man on campus:\u201d Danny Smith is the campus.\n\nAbout Post Author"}, {"url": "https://steelersdepot.com/2015/05/danny-smiths-coaching-journey-goes-full-circle/", "page_content": "In the world of coaching, it\u2019s a rarity to be able to say you\u2019re on a team that you grew up rooting for, and one that is near and dear to your heart. Although not as ballyhooed as an offensive or defensive coordinator is, a special teams coach is just as important, as the game of field position can easily be the difference in a win, loss or tie.\n\nSuch is the tale of Steelers\u2019 special teams boss, Danny Smith, a Pittsburgh native who played his high school football at Pittsburgh Central Catholic. After playing defensive back at Edinboro State from 1971-75, he took a graduate assistant position here as well up until 1977.\n\nThen, as fate would have it, his magical coaching carousel brought him back to a familiar place where he started, at Central Catholic. At PCC in 1977, Smith was one of two assistants who helped develop and mold Parade All-American quarterback Dan Marino, who had basically every major college in the country after him. He owned a rocket for a right arm, and Smith helped mold the youngster, who as we all know now resides in the Pro Football Hall Of Fame.\n\nFollowing that were Clemson, The College of William & Mary, Georgia Tech and The Citadel before his NFL coaching opportunity finally came knocking in 1995, when he was hired as special teams/defensive backs coach. After stints with the Lions and Bills, Smith finally began making a name for himself when he was named special teams coordinator of the Redskins. In his second season there in 2005, Washington ranked near the top of the league in punt and kickoff coverage, and in 2006, not only was the coverage tight, but the splash plays were aplenty with return touchdowns, blocked punts and field goals.\n\nAs the unit\u2019s success rose, so did Smith\u2019s name. In fact, in 2010, the Steelers and Mike Tomlin were denied a request to interview Smith for the same position in Pittsburgh.\n\n\u201cIn the NFL, there\u2019s not a lot you can do about it when a team denies permission,\u201d said Smith, according to Ray Fittipaldo of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fight those things because it\u2019s good to be wanted and those type of things.\u201d\n\nHowever, fast forward to January 2013, after Amos Jones left Pittsburgh for the desert to run the special teams under Bruce Arians, and Tomlin came calling again. This time, he would not be denied, and I\u2019m sure you can guess what Smith\u2019s answer was. After 37 years of coaching stops littered all across the country, Smith finally was home.\n\n\u201cI get emotional talking about it because I haven\u2019t lived here in a long time,\u201d Smith said when he was hired, according to Fittipaldo. \u201cGrowing up here, the Steelers really stick with you. They really do.\u201d\n\nHis expertise on special teams was evident even in his first season in Pittsburgh, as kicker Shaun Suisham connected on 30 of 32 field goals, and his 93.8 field goal percentage set a new single-season team record. It also marked Antonio Brown\u2019s first trip to the Pro Bowl, as a returner and wide receiver. He had five returns of 40+ yards on the season, including his 67-yard touchdown in week 15 versus Cincinnati.\n\nNow heading into 2015, he\u2019s tasked with finding someone to take over for Brown\u2019s duties since the likelihood of getting injured on special teams is much higher, considering the size of the players who have built up a 25 or 30-yard head of steam. Perhaps it\u2019s Dri Archer, whose college highlights show off his blinding speed taking many kickoff and punt returns to paydirt. Either way, it\u2019s way too risky placing an All-Pro with Brown\u2019s immense talents at risk.\n\nOne thing is for certain, and that\u2019s the fact that Smith is in a place he\u2019d likely love to end his career in, and that\u2019s the Steel City. And after all the years he\u2019s put into his coaching career, what a better ending than to finally come home.\n\n\u201cWhen the opportunity came, I really wanted to do it,\u201d he said, according to Fittipaldo. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so special about the Steelers because that\u2019s how they operate, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about. I\u2019m excited about the players I have here. We have good work ethic and great tradition. Those things make it easy to coach.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://steelersdepot.com/2021/01/danny-smith-details-covid-diagnosis-happy-to-be-back-coaching-football/", "page_content": "Like almost all football coaches, Danny Smith loves coaching football. Being around his guys, leading the team, getting the job done, and winning on Sundays. That\u2019s been his focus for almost all of his time with Pittsburgh. But briefly earlier this season, his focus was just on getting well.\n\nSmith tested positive for COVID in late November and briefly spent time away from the team. He ultimately didn\u2019t miss a game, a byproduct of the Steelers/Ravens game repeatedly postponed, but hated to be away from football even for the short time he was.\n\nTalking to the media yesterday, Smith was asked about his COVID diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI appreciate it. I am healthy and doing well,\u201d he said via a team transcript. \u201cI had some minor symptoms and the range this thing falls in.\u201d\n\nHe joked being away from coaching was more detrimental to his health than than the virus.\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult. I don\u2019t have a lot of hobbies anyway. For me to not have football about killed me. Not the virus. Not having football about killed me. It was very hard. It\u2019s very hard to not be around these guys. I miss them when I am not around them.\u201d\n\nSmith echoed a similar statement before the season began, saying he was a football coach through and through.\n\nDanny Smith, 66, never considered not coaching this year. \"I don't do nothing but coach football. I don't have hobbies, I don't have nothing. I've been called a lot of names in this business, but house cat isn't one of them.\" \u2014 Brooke Pryor (@bepryor) August 19, 2020\n\nOn a broader scale, Smith described the challenges of the season. Virtual meetings, less face-to-face contact, a big change for a man whose been coaching football since 1976. Smith began his coaching career as an assistant at Edinboro University, a small college just north of Pittsburgh. A Pittsburgh native, he\u2019s been the Steelers\u2019 special teams coordinator since 2013.\n\n\u201cI miss it when we do a lot of virtual things and things like that because I want to look them in the eye. I am a hands-on kind of guy.\u201d\n\nAnyone who has ever attended a training camp practice can attest to the energy and passion Smith shows in-person. He\u2019s the loudest voice on the field, booming out instructions during special teams sessions, and shows up as the same guy day after day. Smith wears his heart on his sleeve, talks about how much his players mean to him, and it\u2019s the catalyst for guys \u201cbuying in\u201d to the system, even stars in college now asked to do the grunt work on coverage and return teams.\n\nSmith, 66, was at higher risk for complications of COVID because of his age. But he says he\u2019s feeling great now.\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult. I am healthy. Everything is good. It all turned out good for me. I have tested positive with the antibodies and everything and I am good.\u201d\n\nSmith will lead the special teams unit Sunday night against Cleveland. His units have done well this year despite the adversity of the season and the injuries and changes to the group. The Steelers\u2019 kick return game has been the best its been in years, Matthew Wright has done an admirable job replacing Chris Boswell, Jordan Berry is in stellar form, and the normally good coverage units have remained solid."}, {"url": "https://steelersnow.com/steelers-st-coach-danny-smith-not-planning-on-retiring-soon-im-a-lifer/", "page_content": "PITTSBURGH \u2014 Some coaches are just made for the game of football. If there was a coach to exemplify that on the Steelers, it would be hard to point to anyone other than Danny Smith. Smith, 68, who was hired all the way back in 2013, has been coaching football for nearly 50 years \u2014 and he has no plans of retiring any time soon.\n\nSmith\u2019s first job came all the way back in 1976 when he was a graduate assistant for his alma mater, Edinboro University. Smith played for Edinboro from 1972 to 1976, and Smith is a hometown guy. He played at Central Catholic, took Dan Marino under his wing, and simply knows nothing but football. He has made stops all over the coaching map but made the special teams jump in 1995 when he joined the Eagles.\n\nThe Steelers job opened up following the 2012 season, however, and Smith was the obvious choice. At his age, it could be easy to see Smith potentially moving on and sipping Pina Coladas on the beach in retirement. However, he says that will not be happening anytime soon. Instead, Smith is going to continue until he knows he simply can not go any longer. After all, the only game and thing that Smith knows is football. He has been around the game his entire life, and leaving now just does not fit his bill well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lifer, man,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any hobbies. I\u2019m not a golfer or a traveler. That\u2019s a pain in the ass anymore. I don\u2019t know what the hell I would do if I didn\u2019t have this place and football. You probably are going to see me crawl off this field one day. I don\u2019t have any plans. I\u2019m good to go. I love it. I\u2019m prepared for it. I\u2019m forever.\u201d\n\nSmith is not going to walk away from the team anytime soon, and his players would not have it any other way. Gunner Olszewski is new to the Steelers, but Smith is already making a big-time statement on him. There is a myriad of traits that sticks out about Smith to Olszewski. While he may not be on Smith\u2019s level with the gum-chewing just yet, he is certainly taking lessons from everything that Smith is telling him. Coming from a football lifer, that makes it all the more meaningful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d Olszewski said of working with Smith. \u201cThe bank of knowledge that he has, you can ask him anything. You can tell how much that dude loves football. If you ask him, he\u2019ll say he hates football. But only people who absolutely love football will say they hate football. He knows so much about the game and is willing to share it all. You can get him going easily by talking about a punt block or field goal block. He just loves it.\u201d\n\nIt appears that Smith is going nowhere. The Steelers are content with having Smith\u2019s energy, and gum-chewing skills around for as long as possible. He will look to continue a string of successful seasons on special teams while trying to replace Ray-Ray McCloud\u2019s presence at punt returner.\n\nRELATED: Danny Smith Says Chris Boswell Will Get a New Contract Soon"}, {"url": "https://steelersdepot.com/2020/12/sts-coordinator-danny-smith-cleared-to-coach-against-ravens/", "page_content": "Pittsburgh Steelers\u2019 special teams coordinator Danny Smith has been cleared to coach in today\u2019s game against the Baltimore Ravens, according to a tweet sent out by team spokesman Burt Lauten.\n\n#Steelers Special Teams Coordinator Danny Smith (illness) has been cleared to return to his coaching responsibilities.

Smith, who has coached Washington\u2019s special teams since 2004, received permission to interview with the Steelers earlier this week. He has long been pursued by opposing teams, but the Redskins have always worked to keep him on staff.\n\nThe Steelers asked to interview Smith in 2010, but were denied. But the Redskins allowed Smith to interview with his hometown team this offseason. Smith still has family in the Pittsburgh area.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the best coaches, from a technician standpoint. Very detailed and just a great motivator. He brought a passion and fire that really spread throughout the building,\u201d special teams captain Lorenzo Alexander said. \u201dGuys loved playing for him and not just because of the football aspects, but because you could really tell he cared about you off the field too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe made it an honor to play special teams,\u201d Alexander added. \u201cA lot of places, it\u2019s like you\u2019re not good enough to play offense or defense so they throw you on special teams and let\u2019s see what happens. But Danny approached it with the mindset that special teams can help decide the outcome of games if guys really took pride in it. He will definitely be missed.\u201d\n\nSmith came under scrutiny early this season when Washington had two punts blocked. But his unit improved as the season progressed and finished in solid statistical standing.\n\nWashington ranked 16th in the league on kickoff returns this season, with a 23.5-yard average, and 17th on punt returns (9.3 ypr). The kickoff return average marked an improvement on last year\u2019s 22.1-yard-per-return average. The Redskins averaged 8.9 yards per punt return in 2011. They ranked 12th in the league on kickoff coverage with an average of 23.0 yards allowed per kick return. On punt coverage, Washington allowed 8.2 yards per return, eighth in the NFL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe kicking game solidified when the Redskins signed Kai Forbath to replace Billy Cundiff six weeks into the season. Forbath went 17-for-18 on field goals, and by making the first 17 attempts of his career, set an NFL record for first-year kickers.\n\nEarlier this offseason the Redskins lost receivers coach Ike Hilliard to the Buffalo Bills. He and Smith are the only coaches to depart so far\n\nIn 2010, Washington hired Richard Hightower to serve as Smith\u2019s assistant. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how Smith\u2019s departure would affect Hightower\u2019s status.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"}]}
