She worked in a variety of mediums\u2014including oil on canvas, pastel on paper, and lithographic printing\u2014and is widely recognized as one of the most significant artists of the post-war era.\n\nBorn in Chicago on February 12, 1925, Mitchell attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Upon graduating in 1947, she was awarded a travel fellowship that took her to France for a year, where her paintings became increasingly abstract. Returning to the United States in 1949, Mitchell settled in New York and became an active participant in the \u201cNew York School\u201d of painters and poets. She exhibited in the famous \u201c9th Street Show\u201d in 1951, and soon established a reputation as one of the leading young Abstract Expressionist painters. In 1955, Mitchell began dividing her time between New York and France, and in 1959 she settled permanently in France, living and working in Paris. In 1968, she moved to V\u00e9theuil, a small town northwest of Paris, where she worked continuously until her death in 1992.\n\nOver her long and prolific career, the defining elements of Mitchell\u2019s world\u2014water, trees, dogs, poetry, music\u2014created images and memories from which she worked. She once said, \"I paint from remembered landscapes that I carry with me\u2014and remembered feelings of them, which of course become transformed. I could certainly never mirror nature. I would like more to paint what it leaves me with.\" She observed her landscape intensely, and her acute visual observations of form, space, and color in life were part of the visual memories she drew upon while painting.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.lamodern.com/auctions/2023/01/prints-multiples/181", "page_content": "Adja Yunkers\n\nBorn Adolf Junkers in Latvia, Adja Yunkers\u2019 journey to becoming an artist began when he left home at 14 to study art in Saint Petersburg.

Although most, if not all, are long out of print, they can still be accessed through public and university libraries or purchased at used bookstores. These titles present vibrant poetic voices, showcasing a wide array of techniques, forms, and themes, and their translators include a number of significant American poets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly one collection of poems featured on this list is by a poet who lived in the interwar period. The rest are by poets who wrote roughly between the late 1950s and early 1990s. Many of the poets were banned from publication in their native Ukraine throughout most of this period. Some were official, published poets who had to maneuver carefully in order to stay out of trouble. Two of the poets moved to the United States after World War II and worked in a totally different environment, with access to various traditions and canons that were completely off limits for Ukrainian Soviet poets. Taken together, they present a rich, varied picture of Ukrainian poetry and English poetic translation in the second half of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a4\n\n\n\nBohdan Ihor Antonych, Square of Angels, translated by Mark Rudman, Paul Nemser and Bohdan Boychuk, introduction by Bohdan Rubchak (Ann Arbor: Ardis, 1977).\n\n\n\nBohdan Ihor Antonych (1909-1937), originally from what is now eastern Poland, spent the most fruitful years of his short life in Lviv, where he attended a local university and published his work. The three collections of his poems that appeared during his lifetime, as well as two published posthumously, show a self-made modernist as comfortable writing about nature and metaphysical questions as he was capturing the powerful rhythms of urban life.\n\n\n\nIvan Drach, Orchard Lamps, edited and introduced by Stanley Kunitz, translated by Daniel Halpern, Stanley Kunitz, Paul Nemser, Mark Rudman, Paula Schwartz, Gregory Orr, and Carol Muske (New York: Sheep Meadow Press, 1978).\n\n\n\nIvan Drach (1936-2018) was one of the key poets of the generation known as the shestydesiatnyky \u2014 the people of the \u201960s. In this early period, Drach was known for his experimentation, vivid structural freshness, and thematic diversity. His poems manifested a radical quest for escape from the dominant official genre of socialist realism. This translation project was carried out under the auspices of Stanley Kunitz, who invited his MFA students to work on translations along with the emigre poet Bohdan Boychuk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYuriy Tarnawsky, This is How I Get Well, translated by the author (Suchasnist, 1978).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA member of the New York Group of poets, Yuriy Tarnawsky (b. 1934) has been zigzagging between Ukrainian and English in his writing throughout most of his literary career. This collection lays bare the linguistic bifurcation an exiled author frequently faces. Published in a dual-language format, it presents the poet as an avant-gardist in intensive dialogues with multiple European and South American traditions and in relentless pursuit of stylistic and formal innovation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVasyl Stus, Selected Poems, translated and edited by Jaropolk Lassowsky, introduction by George Y. Shevelov (Munich: Ukrainian Free University, 1987).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in Donbas, Vasyl Stus (1938-1985) was one of the most significant voices in 20th-century Ukrainian poetry. He took a political stance against aggressive Soviet cultural policies and was arrested during the 1968 crackdown on Ukrainian writers, spending much of the rest of his life in captivity. Yet his poems range widely and freely. As George Shevelov points out in his critical introduction, Stus\u2019s work is \u201cthoroughly human and humane[,] full of exaltation and abasement, of despair and joy, of malediction and compassion, of shouts of pain and gnashing teeth, and of retreats into one\u2019s self and discoveries therein of the universe\u2019s boundlessness.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBohdan Boychuk, Memories of Love: Selected Poems, translated by David Ignatow, Mark Rudman, and Bohdan Boychuk (New York: Sheep Meadow Press, 1989).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his last major cooperation with American poets David Ignatow and Mark Rudman, Bohdan Boychuk (1927-2017), who moved to the United States in 1949 and settled in New York, served as an interlocutor for his own poetry. Translated as rhythmic prose poems and verse libre, these pieces are divided into four parts and convincingly convey, as one critic put it, the \u201ctestimony of a troubled survivor.\u201d The poet\u2019s voice is sharp and straightforward, yet emotionally deep \u2014 both when he talks about the destruction of the Jews in his hometown and when he deals with eternal questions of love, home, and displacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLina Kostenko, Selected Poetry: Wanderings of the Heart, translated with an afterword by Michael Naydan (New York: Garland Publishing, 1990).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLina Kostenko (b. 1930), another influential poet belonging to the generation of shestydesiatnyky, wrote most of the poems included in this collection during the two short periods of cultural \u201cThaw\u201d after Stalin\u2019s death. Featuring over 90 poems from the poet\u2019s first three collections, and other poems written between the 1950s and 1960s, the book gives readers a sense of Kostenko\u2019s impressive arsenal of themes and tones. The voice changes from one collection to another, but remains always vibrant and unexpected, free of the obligatory clich\u00e9s that filled the official poetry of previous decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIhor Kalynets, Crowning the Scarecrow: Appeals to Conscience in Lviv 1968-1969, translated by Marco Carynnyk (Toronto: Exile Editions, 1990).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Ihor Kalynets (b. 1939) debuted in the 1960s, his verse was almost immediately censored. Officially silenced for many decades, he continued to write, and his poems were circulated in samizdat in Ukraine and published in tamizdat in the West. Quite heavily influenced by Bohdan Ihor Antonych, as well as by other modernists of the 1920s, Kalynets experiments formally yet shows a profound interest in cultural roots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVasyl Holoborodko, Icarus with Butterfly Wings, translated by Myrosia Stefaniuk (Toronto: Exile Editions, 1991).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVasyl Holoborodko (b. 1945) is a representative of the 1970s generation and a poet who belonged to the unofficial Kyiv School of Poetry. His verse is melancholic, intellectual, hermeneutic, but, at the same time, radiates tranquility. One can read it as a sustained search for solace. Though he was able to publish between 1963 and 1969, Holoborodko then faced harsh Soviet censorship and didn\u2019t see his work in print again until 1988.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMykola Vorobiov, Wild Dog Rose Moon, translated by Myrosia Stefaniuk (Toronto: Exile Editions, 1991).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMykola Vorobiov (b. 1941), a poet and artist, also belonged to the unofficial Kyiv School and is typically listed as a representative of the 1970s generation. Like other poets belonging to that generation, he was not officially accepted or published until perestroika. The driving element in his poetry is imagination, and his dense imagery and surreal metaphors are endlessly captivating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOksana Zabuzhko, A Kingdom of Fallen Statues: Poems and Essays, edited by Marco Carynnyk, translated by Marco Carynnyk, Askold Melnyczuk, Michael M. Naydan, Wana Phipps, Lisa Sapinkopf, Douglas Burnet Smith, and Virlana Tkacz (Toronto: Wellspring, 1996).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA major contemporary poet, and quite possibly the strongest feminist voice of her generation, Oksana Zabuzhko (b. 1960) is also a fiction writer, essayist, and translator. Although diverse in its themes, the poet\u2019s first English-language collection questions the role and responsibility of Ukrainian authors, situating them in a broader cultural context. Some of the poems are direct responses to calamities and tragedies that happened in 20th-century Ukrainian history.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOleh Lysheha, Selected Poems, translated by James Brasfield and the author, introduction by George Grabowicz (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 1999).\n\n\n\n\n\nOleh Lysheha (1949-2014) was often considered the \u201cpoets\u2019 poet\u201d of contemporary Ukraine. Not published until the late 1980s, Lysheha\u2019s work is interesting for several reasons. It may appear direct and simple, easy to follow and engage with, but it builds peculiar effects over time. His strategy, the scholar George Grabowicz asserts, is \u201cto weave his experiences, and feelings, and questions in patterns so subtle that they still remain as mysterious as when they were first written.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.lamodern.com/auctions/2022/09/prints-multiples/149", "page_content": "Adja Yunkers\n\nBorn Adolf Junkers in Latvia, Adja Yunkers\u2019 journey to becoming an artist began when he left home at 14 to study art in Saint Petersburg.

B. Priestley observed in 1947, \"but today's glittering cosmopolis belongs to the world, if the world does not belong to it.\"\n\nProsperity\n\nThe New York City that emerged from World War II was a dramatically different place than the city that had entered it four years before. The change was in large part due to the war itself, which had finally lifted the city out the Depression, and ushered in an era of unparalleled prosperity.\n\nEconomic Dominance\n\nIn four years, the explosion in commercial activity brought on by the war had reignited the city's economic engine, carrying it to a level of economic power and dominance like nothing before or since. By the late 1940s, New York had become the world's largest manufacturing center, with 40,000 factories and over a million factory workers. It was the nation's largest wholesaling center, accounting for a fifth of all wholesale transaction in America. It was the world's biggest port, handling 40 percent of the nation's waterborne freight -- 150 million tons a year. And it was the world's financial capital, trading hundreds of millions of dollars each day. It was, above all, home to the immense corporations that now dominated life in the United States and, increasingly, around the world. One hundred thirty five of the nation's 500 largest industrial companies \u2014 including Standard Oil, General Electric, U.S. Steel, Union Carbide, IBM and RCA \u2014 were located in what was now called \"headquarters city.\"\n\nMore than ever before, as the shop windows filed past in a glittering parade, there was the sense of New York as a great international city to which all the ends of the world had come. London used to be like that, but somehow one had forgotten it, so long had it been since the Hispanos and Isottas had glided down Piccadilly, so many aeons since the tropical fruit had glowed in the Bond Street windows. Coming from that sort of London to America, in the old days, New York had seemed just -- American; not typical of the continent, maybe, but American first and foremost. Now it was the centre of the world. \u2014 Beverley Nichols, 1948\n\nUnited Nations\n\nBy the end of 1946, New York's central economic position had been reinforced by a new role, one which the city had not enjoyed since 1790, when the nascent federal government had departed the city for Philadelphia and, ultimately, Washington, D.C. In December of that year, the United Nations selected New York as the location for its permanent headquarters, and work soon began on a 16-acre site along the East River, where a dazzling new complex would rise over the coming years. \"New York is not a state capital or a national capital, the writer E. B. White observed, \"but it is by way of becoming the capital of the world.\"\n\nCulture Boom\n\nAlong with the economic boom came an exciting cultural ferment, as innovative figures and trends began reshaping the city's \u2014 and the nation's -- arts and entertainment. At Carnegie Hall, a charismatic young conductor and composer named Leonard Bernstein had recently taken over the baton of the New York Philharmonic and was dazzling audiences with his daring interpretations of the classical repertory. Just a few blocks south, meanwhile, his own music was revolutionizing the Broadway musical, in an inventive show called \"On the Town.\" Based on a Jerome Robbins ballet, and written by the young team of Betty Comden and Adolph Green, the show related the adventures of three sailors with a single day to spend in New York. Uptown, a different kind of music was taking shape in the nightclubs of Harlem, as brilliant musicians such as Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk pioneered a new style of jazz called \"Be-bop.\"\n\nInternational Art Center\n\nIn the coming few years, it would become obvious that the war had marked another cultural shift, as the center of the art world, which for over a century had held firm in Paris, now moved across the Atlantic. The rise of fascism in Europe and the terrible conflict that followed had brought dozens of important modern artists to New York -- including Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Leger, Wassily Kandinsky, and Piet Mondrian. They would not only carry out their own important work but have a galvanizing effect on a younger generation of American artists -- including Jackson Pollock, Willem De Kooning, Helen Frankenthaler, Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell and half a dozen others -- who soon constituted a \"New York School\" of abstract expressionist painters, completing the transfer of the art world's center of gravity to Manhattan.\n\nAnother Postwar Milestone\n\nAs the city boldly stepped into a new postwar era, however, the man who had done more than anyone else to ensure its greatness in the preceding decade and a half would not be there to see it. On December 31, 1945, after 12 years in office, Fiorello La Guardia, the greatest mayor in the history of New York, finally stepped down. He was worn out by his three terms, and especially his final four years, when the constraints of wartime kept him from completing his visionary plans to reconstruct the city. Already ill with pancreatic cancer, he would live fewer than two years more, passing away on the night of September 20, 1947, at the age of 64.\n\nInto the Future\n\nFor 12 long years, La Guardia had struggled to reconcile two competing visions of the city. Planners like Robert Moses had championed a city of tomorrow \u2014 beholden to the car and the highway, and to forces beyond the city's borders. An alternate vision embraced the old working city of Walt Whitman, Al Smith and Emma Lazarus \u2014 the city of blocks, neighborhoods and crowded streets that, however shabby and rundown in appearance, were New York's heartbeat. In the years following the war, as urban planners proposed remaking the city on a breathtaking scale, New York would begin to take leave of the past as never before, and rush headlong into the future."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/immigrants-new-york-city", "page_content": "Immigrants, New York City\n\nIRISH AND GERMAN IMMIGRANTS\n\nTHE NEW IMMIGRATION\n\nASSIMILATION\n\nCHALLENGES FOR IMMIGRANTS\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nFor most countries, immigration constitutes an engine of transformation. For the United States, New York City serves as a symbol of the many peoples from all over the globe who have arrived in the country. It also serves as a microcosm of the complex cultural, political, and socioeconomic issues that immigration gives rise to.\n\nBy the time the first Europeans sailed into what is today New York City in the early sixteenth century, the migration of indigenous people into the region had been occurring for thousands of years. The Lenape\u2014who spoke the Algonquin language\u2014populated the area at the time. The influx of European immigrants was slow at first. It was not until the third decade of the seventeenth century that the first major wave of European immigrants settled in the New York City area. The largest immigrant groups were of northern and western European background. Dutch immigrants were the first to locate in what is now Manhattan, founding a settlement they called New Amsterdam. African populations also made an early appearance in the region. On September 15, 1655, the ship Witte Paert brought 300 African slaves to New Amsterdam. By 1664, the black population was estimated at between 20 and 25 percent of the total.\n\nIn the summer of 1664, New Amsterdam fell to the British. In 1674, the colony was granted to James, the Duke of York, giving New York its name. The Dutch remained the largest immigrant group throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, followed by French Huguenots. Over 60, 000 people resided in the city in 1800.\n\nImmigration into New York greatly expanded in the period between 1815 and 1880, which became known as the Old Immigration era. The immigrant flow from northern and western Europe continued, but from different countries. Hundreds of thousands of Irish and German immigrants moved into the city, followed by English and Scots. By 1860, New York City had 813, 669 residents, out of which 383, 717 were foreign-born, including 203, 740 Irish and 118, 292 Germans.\n\nThe Irish migration to the United States in the nineteenth century was motivated by a wide array of forces. The American economy had been expanding rapidly and was an attractive source of jobs. New York City itself was booming as a result of the opening of the Erie Canal, which allowed transportation of goods along the Hudson River all the way to the Great Lakes. At the same time, what is now Ireland had become the most densely populated part of Europe, with hundreds of thousands of young workers desperately looking for employment, some in the United States. Immigration peaked in the 1850s, when close to a million Irish moved to America. This migration surge was a result of sharply deteriorating economic conditions in Ireland. In 1845, a fungal disease viciously attacked Irish potato fields, leaving crops almost entirely destroyed. Famine and disease followed, with more than a million people dying and many others fleeing to the United States and other countries in the ensuing decade.\n\nMany of the Irish immigrants were poor and unskilled. They lived in tenements, which were large, cramped, multifamily housing units with scant plumbing, heating, or lighting. They were often discriminated against and vilified for taking employment opportunities from U.S.-born Americans. Nativist groups, whose ideology was that the immigrants were hurting the American economy, society, and culture, campaigned against Irish immigrants, often spreading bigoted views of the Irish. Like other immigrant groups, the Irish were initially marginalized from the city\u2019s social and political mainstream. Historians such as Noel Ignatiev and David R. Roedinger find that these immigrants were considered racial minorities at the time, not part of the white population of the city. This poverty and social exclusion exploded in the draft riots of 1863. In July, as the names of thousands of Civil War draftees were announced, many poor Irish who could not pay the $300 draft waiver ran into the streets of the city in protest, burning buildings, looting stores, and assaulting and killing thousands of people. Black residents of the city came under savage attacks that were fueled not just by prejudice but also by the rioters seeking a scapegoat, blaming blacks for their many miseries, including the Civil War draft, low wages, and lack of employment opportunities.\n\nDespite the initial barriers, Irish immigrants gradually progressed in the economy and in society. Because of their growing numbers, they were able to exert considerable political influence in New York City\u2019s government institutions, especially through the Democratic Party. Indeed, from being considered a disenfranchised racial minority, the Irish eventually became part of the ethnic white majority population of the city.\n\nAlthough most German immigrants in the nineteenth century moved to America for the same reason as the Irish\u2014economic opportunity\u2014they had very different origins. They tended to be highly skilled and were able to avoid poverty. From piano production and rubber manufacturing to finance, Germans dominated many high-income sectors of the New York City economic structure. Despite its comparative wealth, the German community in New York\u2014called Kleindeutschland\u2014became highly segregated from the rest of the population. This was partly the result of language differences, but it also reflected the reproduction of German institutions within the community.\n\nThe ethnic composition of immigrants to New York City changed drastically in the period from 1880 to 1920, when it shifted toward immigrants of southern and eastern European background. This immigrant wave, consisting of Italians, Russian Jews, Poles, and Greeks, among others, became known as the New Immigration. Many of these immigrants passed through the immigrant reception center at Ellis Island in the New York City harbor, which opened January 2, 1892.\n\nLike many other mass migration movements, this one followed a chain migration process, by which the initial flow of migrants self-sustains and expands over time. The earlier immigrants sent information about employment opportunities back home, then provided social, economic, and cultural support to later migrants. Between 1880 and 1920, more than 4.1 million Italian immigrants arrived in the United States. Many of these stayed in New York City. Although only 14, 000 Italian immigrants resided in New York City in 1880, by 1920 there were almost 400, 000. Similarly, the city\u2019s Russian Jewish immigrant community grew from 14, 000 in 1880 to over half a million in 1920, becoming the largest foreign-born population.\n\nThe reasons for this mass migration episode are many. In the early nineteenth century, travel from Europe to the United States could take months. By the late nineteenth century, however, the growth of steamship and railroad travel had made the global movement of people both faster and cheaper. Economic dislocations in southern and eastern Europe, particularly those associated with the decline of agriculture, had generated populations of workers eager to seek opportunities elsewhere. A large share of Italian immigrants, for example, came from southern Italy, especially Sicily and the Mezzogiorno, regions that had stagnated relative to north. Many of these immigrants were unskilled and obtained relatively low-paying jobs in America, including construction (for men) and the garment industry (for women). The mass migration of Russian\u2014and other\u2014Jews to America in the period from 1880 to 1920 was triggered not just by economic forces but also by the resurgence of anti-Semitism, pogroms, and other restrictive laws in many parts of central and eastern Europe. This led them to seek refuge in America. Many of these migrants were skilled workers who became artisans, craftsmen, traders, and financiers.\n\nThe late 1920s saw immigration to New York City decline sharply. One reason was the Great Depression, which started in 1929 and lasted through the 1930s. In New York City, unemployment rates reached as high as 25 percent, discouraging potential migrants from moving to America. But economic distress was not the only reason for the drop in immigration. Until the 1920s, the United States had virtually no immigration restrictions. Although border checkpoints had been introduced at twenty-four seaports and popular border crossings such as Ellis Island beginning in the early 1890s, the only restrictions were to exclude sick persons, known criminals, and the like.

But the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1924 ended this lax immigration policy. The law imposed the first permanent quotas on immigration, although Western Hemisphere migrants were exempted. It also created a system of immigration preferences that gave an advantage to western and northern Europe. The 1930s saw further restrictive immigration policy initiatives; immigrants were seen as taking jobs from Americans in a period of severe unemployment.\n\nImmigration began to rebound in the 1940s and 1950s, and it surged again after 1965. In that year, legislation that repealed the quota system established in the 1920s was signed into law. The result was a sharp increase in immigration, especially from developing nations. The proportion of New Yorkers born outside the United States had declined from 34 percent in 1924 to a low of 18 percent in 1970, but by 2000 the proportion had risen back to 36 percent. Most of these immigrants were not from Europe but from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia. Out of the 2,871, 032 immigrants counted by the 2000 U.S. Census of Population, 53 percent were born in Latin America and the Caribbean and 24 percent in Asia. Table 1 shows the population of the largest immigrant groups in 2000. The countries of origin where the largest number of immigrants originated were the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Mexico, and Guyana. Most of these migrants had an economic reason for moving to the city, motivated by huge wage differences between their home countries and a New York City economy that has displayed renewed and resilient strength since the early 1980s. Indeed, recent immigrants have generally been able to raise their families\u2019 standard of living, sending billions of dollars back to their home countries in the form of remittances. But their social and economic progress in the United States has not been without challenges.\n\nAssimilation refers to the process of absorption or fusion of immigrant groups and their descendants into American culture or society. Robert E. Park and the Chicago school of sociology were among the first social scientists to study the process of assimilation in Chicago, New York, and other cities, beginning in the 1920s. Their analysis suggested that for the European immigrant groups entering America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, assimilation did gradually occur over time. From the acquisition of English to a successful accommodation to the labor market, the immigrants and their descendants (second and third generations) were becoming an integral part of American civil society. This became known as the melting pot view of American society.\n\nBut concern has been expressed by some social scientists about the process of assimilation of recent immigrants, particularly those from Latin America and the Caribbean. For instance, political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, in his book Who Are We? The Challenges to American Cultural Identity (2004), claims that, unlike previous immigration flows, recent immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean have not assimilated into mainstream American society. Other social scientists have also expressed concerns that recent immigrants may face difficulties assimilating to the American labor market. The evidence on these issues is not clear-cut.\n\nRecent New York City immigrants struggle in an economy that is increasingly unequal and that rewards skills and schooling above anything else. For immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean, whose level of schooling is substantially below the average, this leads to comparatively low income levels and high poverty rates. Table 1 displays basic indicators of socioeconomic status for various New York City populations. The data are from the 2000 U.S. Census of Population. As can be seen, the annual income per person in the average New York City household was $24, 010. But for Dominican migrants, the largest immigrant group in the city, the average income per capita of $10,417 was less than half the average for the city and less than one-third the income per capita of the white population. Poverty rates among immigrants also tend to be higher than among the overall city population. For example, according to the 2000 census, about 30 percent of both Dominican and Mexican immigrants in New York had income below the poverty line, much higher than the citywide poverty rate of approximately 20 percent. The struggle of immigrants in and around New York City is poignantly portrayed by Dominican writer Junot Diaz in his novel Drown (1996).\n\nTable 1 shows that the lower socioeconomic status of New York immigrants is not linked to high unemployment. The unemployment rates among immigrants are not that different from those of other New Yorkers. But wages are much lower, an outcome connected in part to lower educational attainment. As Table 1 depicts, the percentage of immigrants twenty-five years of age or older who had not completed a high school education in 2000 was much higher than for the rest of the city\u2019s population; for Dominicans it was 56 percent, more than twice the average citywide.\n\nSome recent immigrants are also undocumented workers and face even more serious socioeconomic challenges. Estimates for 2005 suggest that as many as 10 million undocumented workers may be residing in the United States, with half a million in the New York City area. Recent immigration policy initiatives have led to more stringent U.S. immigration enforcement efforts, especially after the September 11, 2001, World Trade Center attacks. As a consequence, many undocumented workers\u2014whether from China, Mexico, or Ecuador\u2014are forced further underground, fearing deportation after many years of residence in the country. Entry into the United States from many developing countries has also become much tougher for both documented and undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut the social and economic struggles of the new immigrants are not new. Unskilled immigrants have historically struggled in the New York City economy. Even social scientists who proposed the melting pot theory noted that immigrant assimilation took several generations and that immigrants themselves often remained embedded in ethnic enclaves with limited linguistic, political, and economic incorporation into American society, whether in the form of a Kleindeutschland or a barrio. Some find that America, particularly urban America, was not and probably never will be culturally homogenous. For instance, Nathan Glazer and Daniel Patrick Moynihan concluded in Beyond the Melting Pot (1963) that in New York City cultural diversity and ethnic identity remain even after many generations, a conclusion shared more recently by sociologists Victor Nee and Richard Alba. At the same time, some immigrant groups have historically been able to make the transition from being marginalized racial and ethnic minorities to being considered as part of the country\u2019s majority white population while others have not. Social scientists such as Milton M. Gordon and John Ogbu have argued that discrimination and social exclusion may delay or permanently stall any processes of assimilation of stigmatized immigrant groups. The \u201cracialization\u201d of these immigrants may not, however, run along simple black-white racial lines. As sociologists Jennifer Hochschild, Clara Rodriguez, and Mary Waters have noted recently, racial formation for recent immigrants may evolve complex constructions, involving perhaps multiple racial identities. In addition, the recent waves of migrants to New York City include many who move back and forth between their source countries and the United States. This transnationalization, which makes the new immigration different from the old European immigration waves of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, generates new opportunities but also challenges for the migrants. Sociologists Hector Cordero-Guzman, Robert C. Smith, and Ramon Grosfoguel summarize these issues and discuss the work of the authors mentioned above in their edited volume Migration, Transnationalization, and Race in a Changing New York (2001).\n\nNational opinion surveys suggest that most recent immigrant groups and their children, including those from Latin America and the Caribbean, wish to succeed in American society in a way similar to their earlier cohorts. As in the past, despite serious challenges, many immigrants remain the strongest advocates of the American Dream. Sharply improved standards of living relative to the situation in source countries, as well as positive expectations of future economic progress and social mobility, are behind these opinions. But various populations in the United States\u2014from blacks and Chinese to Puerto Ricans and Mexicans\u2014have faced severe and persistent barriers to their socioeconomic progress. Recent immigrants are not immune from these forces, and they are well aware of the difficulties. For instance, the 2003 Pew Hispanic Center National Survey of Latinos found that over 90 percent of immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean believe that it is very important (for most, essential) that their children receive a college education in order to succeed in American society. But the same survey found that these immigrants are also seriously concerned about the quality of the high schools their children attend, the rising cost of college tuition, and similar issues.\n\nParticularly worrisome is the condition of undocumented immigrants. In 2006, tens of millions of undocumented immigrants and other concerned groups peacefully marched in New York City, Los Angeles, and many other cities to encourage policy makers to adopt policies that will allow the immigrants to emerge from the underground labor markets in which they work. As in the past, appropriate economic, social, and immigration policies that facilitate immigrant socioeconomic mobility will be required to ensure that the new immigrants achieve their goals.\n\nSEE ALSO African Americans; American Dream; Assimilation; Caribbean, The; Citizenship; Diaspora; Disease; Ethnicity; Famine; Great Depression; Huntington, Samuel P.; Immigrants to North America; Immigration; Latinos; Melting Pot; Migration; Mobility, Lateral; Naturalization; Nuyoricans; Ogbu, John U.; Park School, The; Segregation, Residential; U.S. Civil War\n\nBinder, Frederick M., and David M.

The city was changed forever - but how? Anelise Hanson Shrout explains.\n\nIn the decade following the 1845 appearance of the potato blight, over 900,000 Irish emigrants entered the port of New York. By 1855 Irish-born New Yorkers comprised almost one third of the city's total population. By the end of the nineteenth century New York was the largest urban Irish settlement in the world. This Famine immigration fundamentally changed the institutional, social and political character of the city.\n\nFamine immigrants entered New York on ships rife with disease. They often travelled in steerage, deprived of air and space. Ships were required to stop first at the quarantine station on Staten Island, where New York State legislation mandated that all arrivals from foreign ports be medically assessed.\n\nIrish emmigrants sailing to the US, as depicted in the Illustrated London News, 6th July 1850. Source: Illustrated London News/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe influx of immigrants in the 1840s and 1850s overwhelmed these public health checks. In response, in 1847 New York State appointed ten Commissioners of Emigration, whose job was (according to their first report) both to protect immigrants from exploitation and to protect the city from 'the number of such diseased emigrants\u2019 who \u2018even threatened danger to the public health.\u2019\n\nThe Commissioners were particularly concerned with fraud perpetrated upon immigrants. Some recent emigrants fell prey to racketeering ticket agents, who distributed trans-Atlantic tickets in advance of payment. When they could not pay back the price of their tickets, emigrants were \u2018allowed\u2019 to enter the agents\u2019 private accommodations, where they were required to work off their passage with hard labour.\n\nAnother of the fraudsters\u2019 most common schemes was to waylay ill or destitute passengers upon arrival, and direct them to private hospitals or private poor houses. There, emigrants were charged high fees, until they were able to leave, or (more frequently) they died for want of care.\n\nSick and sometimes contagious\n\nAs Famine immigration persisted through the 1840s and early 1850s, the Commissioners also worked to find space for the numerous sick, and sometimes contagious people entering New York from Ireland. These spaces included Bellevue, the city\u2019s only public hospital, and its almshouse.\n\nBellevue Hospital, New York's only public hospital, in mid 1890s.

Collection/Getty Images\n\nSick immigrants were also sent to the growing public health complex on islands in the East River: the \u2018city of asylums\u2019 on Blackwell\u2019s Island and a newly-built hospital complex Ward\u2019s Island. By the latter years of the Famine the majority of patients entering these institutions were Irish. The need to accommodate Irish immigrants fundamentally drove the development of New York City\u2019s public health system.\n\nA city in transition\n\n1840s New York was a city in transition. It encompassed the entirety of the island of Manhattan. At its southern tip, where the Hudson and East Rivers converged, the shores bristled with docks that received trans-Atlantic steamers, as well as smaller boats that moved goods up and down the Atlantic coast.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF PEOPLE OF IRISH DESCENT BY WARD IN 1850. While the Irish were present in every ward of the city, they settled into enclaves in the first, sixth and fourth wards. The first ward was comprised of the Battery, where the Famine Irish would have found themselves after disembarking. The sixth ward contained the infamous Five Points neighbourhood, and the fourth ward ran along the East river near the Brooklyn Bridge. To have a closer look at the map, click here.\n\nThe neighbourhoods at the southern end of Manhattan had historically been home to professionals, but by the middle decades of the nineteenth century the well-to-do were moving north and labourers and immigrants were moving in. These new residents had little money and crammed either into the re-purposed houses of elites, or into \u2018tenements\u2019 built to maximise occupancy in a minimum of space.\n\nFarther north in Manhattan, large estates were being remade into regimented city streets. Infrastructure projects \u2013 railroads, bridges and aqueducts \u2013 were a hallmark of this era in New York\u2019s history. Labourers in search of work set up camps and shantytowns around these construction sites, creating workers\u2019 enclaves away from the bustling downtown.\n\nA map of Manhattan in 1844, from the Society for the Diffusion of U [sic]. Source: Picturenow/Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\nIrish social networks shape the city\n\nThose famine emigrants who were not sent to the city\u2019s hospitals tended to settle in these emerging working-class neighbourhoods. These new settlement patterns fundamentally changed the character of the city. Slums, like the notorious Five Points neighbourhood, became home to many newly-arrived Irish.\n\nIrish social networks often determined where people settled. For instance, as American historian Tyler Anbinder has shown, former tenants of Lord Landsdowne collectively settled in Five Points.\n\nWhile many Irish men positioned themselves at the heart of the city in search of work, the most destitute drifted to the edges of the expanding metropolis, where they lived in shantytowns, farmed meagrely, or scavenged for food.\n\nIn contrast, historian Hasia Diner has demonstrated that Irish women and girls made up a considerable part of New York City\u2019s domestic workforce, and many lived in the upper-class houses in which they worked (though some also took on domestic labour in less opulent surroundings).\n\nPolitical animals\n\nThese emigrants changed the demography of New York City, but also impacted its geography, driving the development of new neighbourhoods, businesses and social groups.\n\nTammany Hall, home of the Democratic Party's political machine circa 1900. Source: CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nIrish immigration also shaped New York City politics. Once naturalised, the Irish invited the extant political parties to determine the best ways to woo the new voting bloc. As the Irish became involved in New York politics, they perpetuated systems of patronage that favoured themselves over other immigrant groups.\n\nFor example, the Democratic Party\u2019s Tammany Hall political machine, which controlled New York City politics in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, expertly courted the Irish vote with political favours. This patronage evolved over the years to formal participation in New York politics. This political agency enabled the Irish, particularly Irish men, to use politics as a buffer to ease the difficulties of immigration.\n\nDISTRIBUTION OF PEOPLE OF IRISH DESCENT BY WARD IN 1855. By 1855, the Irish presence had increased across the city, and especially in lower Manhattan, where buildings were less well maintained and rents were cheaper. These lower wards also had a greater need for unskilled labour. Similarly, many settled in the upper wards of Manhattan, in an effort to take advantage of building work that expanded the city northwards. These numbers only reflect the number of Irish-born in New York City. The Irish population, consisting of both immigrants and their children, would have been larger. To have a closer look at the map, click here.\n\nAnti-immigrant nativists\n\nHowever, not all politicians celebrated Irish visibility in the political sphere. Some Americans saw Irish emigrants as a danger to white, Protestant American privilege, and particularly a danger to their jobs and political control. In response, anti-immigrant nativists formed the \u2018Know-Nothing\u2019 party in 1853, intending to protect white American interests.\n\nAt the same time, new labour organisations were formed to protect the rights of non-immigrant American workers. David Roediger and Noel Ignatieve have shown that in the years after the Civil War Irish labourers would re-purpose and re-tool rhetoric about \u2018good\u2019 Americans to define themselves in opposition to enslaved people and free people of colour, and in order to argue for an Irish place in white American society.\n\nMany Irish immigrants defined themselves as \"good\" immigrants\", which could mean subjugating people of colour.

Source: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images\n\nThe Famine\u2019s impact on New York did not end when the immediate subsistence crisis was over. Famine emigrants established social networks that would continue to draw new arrivals for years to come. Despite anti-Irish prejudice that continued into the twentieth century, the Irish in New York continued to build communities, rise socially, and be involved politically.\n\nThe systems of public health that had been created in response to large-scale Irish migration would continue to function until Ellis Island was established in 1892. Blackwell\u2019s Island, which housed institutions that served Famine immigrants, continues to serve as a site for New York\u2019s hospitals to the present day. In these ways, and many others, the Famine fundamentally shaped New York City.\n\nThis piece is part of the Great Irish Famine project coordinated by UCC and based on the Atlas of the Great Irish Famine.

While not immigrants, a great number of Africans also came to New York as part of the Dutch East India Company slave trade.\n\nIn 1626 the first Africans arrived, brought by the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch East India Company was the biggest importer of slaves through the 1600s, and mainly Africans from Angola were brought into New Amsterdam. There they were forced to build roads, clear the forests of Manhattan, and grow crops. By 1756 there were over 13,000 slaves in New York, ranking it as the largest slave-importing colony in the North.\n\nThe Germans began immigrating to New York in the 1700s. Most of them were from the Palatine area of Germany and were of the Protestant faith. After relocating to Holland and then England, they made the trek to New York. In 1710 alone a little over 2,000 Germans arrived in New York.\n\nNew York Immigration\n\nWhen the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, New York became a state. The Dutch, British, Germans, and newly freed Africans (freed between 1799 and 1817) began to welcome new groups of immigrants by the 1840s.\n\nBecause the Great Famine (aka potato famine) had decimated Ireland, by 1847 over 50,000 Irish converged on New York City. That year over 50,000 new Germans also moved into New York, causing widespread panic among the 300,000 New Yorkers already living there. These immigrants were forced into the worst jobs and worst homes the island had to offer.\n\nGermans were met with hostility, but they had established community in New York and so fared better than the Irish. The Irish faced angry mobs and extreme hostility even into the Civil War years where they were drafted into the army at alarming rates.\n\nThe 1880s saw the beginning of new immigration, where droves of Europeans came to the U.S., arriving at Ellis Island in the New York Harbor. Their first sight was the newly built Statue of Liberty. This new wave of immigrants came to look for jobs or to escape religious persecution or war, among many other reasons. European Jews, Russians, Greeks, and Italians came into Ellis Island and settled in ethnic neighborhoods around New York City.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution in New York City offered unskilled laborers work for low pay and in dangerous conditions. Immigrants lived in rat-infested, multi-family apartments\u2014tenement buildings riddled with disease. Immigrants also faced nativism, where older more established Americans (who were immigrants as well) disliked the new immigrants."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Migration", "page_content": "The greater economic and educational opportunities led to an explosion of artistic expression in music and literature. Migrants and their children created the Harlem Renaissance , changed the sound of the blues music that they brought north with them, desegregated sports, and became involved in politics. The Great Migration arguably was a factor leading to the American civil rights movement .\n\nMany African Americans in the South found themselves trapped in sharecropping jobs and other forms of debt peonage with no hope of improvement in their circumstances. Jim Crow laws kept them in an inferior position relative to white people, and they were denied political rights. There were more jobs available in the North , and, though racism was rampant, racial segregation was not mandated there. They embarked on the Great Migration seeking economic and social opportunity.\n\nThe Great Migration was the movement of some six million African Americans from rural areas of the Southern states of the United States to urban areas in the Northern states between 1916 and 1970. It occurred in two waves, basically before and after the Great Depression . At the beginning of the 20th century, 90 percent of black Americans lived in the South. By 1970 nearly half of all African Americans lived in Northern cities.\n\nGreat Migration, in U.S. history, the widespread migration of African Americans in the 20th century from rural communities in the South to large cities in the North and West. At the turn of the 20th century, the vast majority of black Americans lived in the Southern states. From 1916 to 1970, during this Great Migration, it is estimated that some six million black Southerners relocated to urban areas in the North and West.\n\nRapper Roy Kinsey discusses the Great Migration and creating an audio genealogy of Black history See all videos for this article\n\nThe massive stream of European emigration to the United States, which had begun in the late 19th century and waned during World War I, slowed to a trickle with immigration reform in the 1920s. As a result, urban industries were faced with labour shortages. A huge internal population shift among African Americans addressed these shortfalls, particularly during the World Wars, when defense industries required more unskilled labour. Although the Great Migration slowed during the Great Depression, it surged again after World War II, when rates of migration were high for several decades.\n\nThe \u201cpush\u201d factors for the exodus were poor economic conditions in the South\u2014exacerbated by the limitations of sharecropping, farm failures, and crop damage from the boll weevil\u2014as well as ongoing racial oppression in the form of Jim Crow laws. \u201cPull\u201d factors included encouraging reports of good wages and living conditions that spread by word of mouth and that appeared in African American newspapers. With advertisements for housing and employment and firsthand stories of newfound success in the North, the Chicago Defender, for example, became one of the leading promoters of the Great Migration. In addition to Chicago, other cities that absorbed large numbers of migrants include Detroit, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; and New York City.\n\nSeeking better civil and economic opportunities, many blacks were not wholly able to escape racism by migrating to the North, where African Americans were segregated into ghettos and urban life introduced new obstacles. Newly arriving migrants even encountered social challenges from the black establishment in the North, which tended to look down on the \u201ccountry\u201d manners of the newcomers."}]}
