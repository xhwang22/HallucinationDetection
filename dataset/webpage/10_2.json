In terms of gender and sexuality, it shows its ages in ways you would expect, but it still holds up as an intriguing first contact novel.\n\n\n\nHumanity has made contact with only one other sentient people, the Hwarhath, but they have been locked into war for fifty years. Now, the humans and Hwarhath are finally sitting down to negotiate a peace, but they know so little about each other.\n\n\n\nAnna Perez is a biologist studying the native sea creatures of the planet where the humans and Hwarhath have decided to have their talks. She\u2019s more interested in her work than the talks \u2014 she thinks that one of the species may be sentient, although none of her colleagues believe her. However, she is drawn into the process when she befriends a human who\u2019s working for the Hwarhath. Nicholas Sanders was an intelligence operative captured by the Hwarhath during the war, and he has chosen to ally himself with them, largely because of his romantic relationship with a Hwarhath general. The human military regards him as a traitor to his species, and they want to use Anna to spy on him.\n\n\n\nBefore I delve into the plotting and characterization, I want to go ahead and talk about the way Ring of Swords deals with gender and sexuality. Part of the difficulty the humans and Hwarhath have understanding each other is that the Hwarhath have very rigid gender roles. It\u2019s a matriarchal society where the women run the home, and the men are sent outside of it to become soldiers. Since the species unified under a single government, they as a society didn\u2019t know what to do with their men when there wasn\u2019t a war to fight. Thus, when humans were discovered, they were rejoiced as an enemy for the Hwarhath men to combat.\n\n\n\nIn Hwarhath society, men and women largely live separately and sexual acts or attraction between men and women is deeply taboo. Instead, same-sex relations are the norm. The find human society\u2019s focus on heterosexuality deeply disturbing and many of the humans are likewise disturbed by the aliens\u2019 homosexuality. This is one of the ways in which Ring of Swords shows its age. The attitudes around same-sex attraction have changed a lot since Arnason wrote the novel, and thus the attitudes presented by these futuristic humans seem outdated. I\u2019m not saying that homophobia doesn\u2019t exist anymore! But things have changed so much, so it doesn\u2019t make sense that the human diplomatic core would act like homosexuality was that taboo.\n\n\n\nAnother issue with the treatment of gender and sexuality in Ring of Swords is that it\u2019s incredibly binary. Everyone is either cis men or cis women, and there\u2019s no recognition of non-binary or trans people. This is something I\u2019ve encountered with a lot of older feminist sci-fi, so it wasn\u2019t exactly surprising. The novel also deals with sexuality as almost a purely homo/hetero binary and contains no reference to the possibility of multiple gender attraction. There is one reference to Hwarhath who prefer not to have sex with either men or women, which could be taken to mean that asexuality is recognized among them (I took it to mean such, although I don\u2019t know what Arnason\u2019s intentions were exactly). It\u2019s mentioned that this isn\u2019t seen as an issue, although I still think it would suck to be an ace Hwarhath.\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned before, a lot of this is what I expect from 90\u2019s feminism (although the potential inclusion of ace people was a surprise). I don\u2019t expect a book written in the 90\u2019s to have 2018 feminism, and I\u2019m sure it was more revolutionary when it was published. Heck, it probably helped pave the way for the more inclusive feminist sci-fi we have now.\n\n\n\nThe only other cultural criticism I have of Ring of Swords is that it was very Western-centric in how it presented human norms. What it presented as normal for humans was actually normal for the West. I feel like it flattened a lot of the diversity present in family structure and gender roles throughout humanity. For instance, a noted difference between the Hwarhath and humans was that Hwarhath lived in large communities of extended families and that humans lived in nuclear families. And, uh, that\u2019s presenting a brief slice of a small segment of the population as something universal? I\u2019m a lot less willing to excuse this sort of Western-centric bias than I am the portrayal of gender and sexuality\u2026 although bisexual and trans people did have some recognition in the 90\u2019s, so \u201ca product of its time\u201d doesn\u2019t fully work in that regard either.\n\n\n\nAlthough these elements don\u2019t really hold up to a modern-day feminist scrutiny, I still enjoyed analyzing them. Also, I generally like books about aliens! Aliens are fun. And I do like first contact stories where two groups of people struggle to understand and communicate with each other, so in that way, Ring of Swords was right up my alley.\n\n\n\nRing of Swords is a slower paced story and not super actiony. It\u2019s more thoughtful and character focused. Third person sections focusing on Anna make up the majority, although it also includes some first-person diary entries from Nicolas. I enjoyed Anna as a protagonist. Other reviewers have called her cold, and maybe she is on the surface. But underneath she\u2019s full of a burning curiosity to understand the world around her and to reach out and make connections across species.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in want of an anthropological science fiction novel, you should give Ring of Swords a go."}, {"url": "https://oceanofpdf.com/authors/eleanor-arnason/pdf-epub-ring-of-swords-hwarhath-1-download/", "page_content": "[PDF] [EPUB] Ring of Swords (Hwarhath, #1) Download by Eleanor Arnason.

At a Chicago convention decades ago, Gene Wolfe said that every time he encounters people who say the most important things happen within their heads, he wants to put them in a small boat on the ocean in the middle of the storm. This connects to my prejudices about mainstream literary fiction.\n\n\u2018\u2018I\u2019ve always read science fiction and fantasy and murder mysteries. I was an English major most of the way through college, and I read The Great Gatsby and Dubliners and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and some of Proust in French, so I got a reasonable background in mainstream literature. But it didn\u2019t interest me the way that science fiction did. My problem with realism is that a realistic novel about the psychological problems of middle-class people is a story which is very similar to the life I\u2019m leading, and thus is not too interesting. Whereas the minute you throw in a dragon or global warming, it becomes very interesting. Internal thoughts become much less important, and you basically want to deal with the dragon.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018\u2018My father\u2019s parents came from Iceland to North America, and I grew up in a house full of books on Norse mythology, the Icelandic sagas, and the novels of the great 20th-century Icelandic writer Halld\u00f3r Laxness. (I have a copy of his novel Independent People inscribed to my father. Laxness misspelled my father\u2019s name.) I have a thing about Iceland, especially the medieval lit\u00aderature, and I have come to love Icelandic folklore. Hidden Folk, which came out early in 2015, is a collection of stories based on Icelandic folklore and literature.\n\n\u2018\u2018Icelanders don\u2019t have princes and princesses \u2013 Iceland was too poor for royalty, even in folktales. Instead, there are trolls, elves, ghosts, outlaws, and ministers who study the black arts. Hidden Folk is very much my own version of Icelandic tales. My elves are unpleasant upper-class types. My trolls are poor farmers and workers, barely surviving. My humans are a mixed lot: farmers and farmwives, students of the magical arts, slaves, a writer, a cop. Over the years, I wrote five Icelandic fantasies \u2013 six since the collection was published, and I\u2019m work\u00ading on a seventh.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018\u2018Science fiction and fantasy have the appeal of strangeness, and of course science and technology are enormously important in science fiction. SF has been dealing with global warming consistently, while the presidential candidates have barely men\u00adtioned it. There\u2019s no question that it\u2019s happening, and it\u2019s going to be devastating. James Lovelock, who came up with the Gaia theory, has said we\u2019re going to be down to a billion people by the end of the century.\n\n\u2018\u2018I read a lot projections of the future, and people never factor in enough. They project a population of nine billion, but they don\u2019t factor in the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse \u2013 famine, war, dis\u00adease, and death due to climate change. All they\u2019re doing is a projection of where we\u2019ve been. Science fiction, when it\u2019s good, will pick up a whole bunch of these ideas at once. There was a panel at the 2016 Minicon about writing SF in which many things are changing, rather than just one. One of the things that makes me crazy about much hard SF is, you\u2019re in the future with unbelievable physics that nobody now can understand\u2026 but everybody has names like Brad and Charles and they\u2019re living the way we live now. That is nuts. Charles Stross\u2019s early novels had more things happening than I could keep track of. They were stunning.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018\u2018Writing Ring of Swords was a lot of fun \u2013 it\u2019s the fastest I\u2019ve ever written a novel, and the first separate hwarhath story, \u2018The Hound of Merin\u2019, was also written at about the same time as the novel. Ring of Swords was going to be the first of a trilogy, and I wrote the second volume, but it was turned down by the publisher. It\u2019s really hard to sell the middle book of a trilogy by itself, so I put it to the side. There were problems with the sequel, and I\u2019m not happy with the way it turned out. (I now have a contract with Aqueduct Press for a revised version of the sequel, so it will finally come out.) I was frustrated with the trilogy, and I had a lot more information about the hwarhath, so I started writing short stories. These turned out to be stories written by hwarhath authors after they en\u00adcountered humanity, not only about the hwarhath, but about them thinking about their own culture, and in some cases thinking about humanity. The hwarhath are extremely rigid in many ways, and meeting a species very much like themselves but with different rules for male and female behavior leads the brighter among them to question what is the nature of men and women, and that underlies a lot of the stories.\u201d\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2018\u2018I have an alien species I\u2019ve written a few stories about, the Goxhat, which are another attempt to look at social stereotypes or maybe ideas of self. In the early part of their culture there were teams, which would be a bunch of Goxhat hatched out of the same clutch of eggs. Each team thought of itself as \u2018I,\u2019 and no individual thought of itself as an individual. They come in four sexes, and a team could be all four sexes or one sex, and it\u2019s all \u2018I.\u2019 My story \u2018Knapsack Poems\u2019 is about the Goxhat early in their history. As their culture evolved, their sense of \u2018I\u2019 got bigger, until the whole species became \u2018I.\u2019 They know that they are different bod\u00adies, but they don\u2019t have a clear sense of themselves as individuals. They\u2019re spacefaring, and they meet other species that don\u2019t have their sense of oneness, so the problem becomes how the Goxhat can think about other species. They meet something that isn\u2019t part of the \u2018I\u2019 \u2013 and what do they do about a species that is millions of \u2018I\u2019s?\u201d\n\nRead the complete interview in the September 2016 issue of Locus Magazine.

There's no real plot, just a couple characters and a journey as Limper flees his old job. They reach a new place, experience some sort of adventure that makes you feel emotions, and then go on to a new place, repeat. It's peaceful and relaxing to read.\n\n\n\nIt even takes its time with its descriptions of simple things, like the landscape they are walking through or the food they are eating. Normally, this sort of thing would irritate me, but it works in this case.\n\n\n\nThat said, the ending is an abomination. It's not a conclusion like in a regular book, just another incident, but in this last story the main character behaves entirely out of character, particularly with respect to the way he thinks about and treats his friends and strangers. He allows his dragon friend to be treated like an animal by someone he just met and likes only because they are pretty, is completely okay with the fact that this person owns slaves (this is the first time they have appeared in the book), and makes a trite, ugly justification of slavery by saying that poor people have to work and so aren't really free either. It was jarring and maddening, and I honestly wish the author had just cut the book at the end of the previous adventure and left it at that. It felt almost like something that could have been the beginning of a book, with the character starting out shitty and then having a character development arc, but instead the book has you get attached to this character and then goes, surprise! Here's a few ways in which this person is actually terrible! The End."}, {"url": "https://nihontoclub.com/articles/reference/swordsmith-index", "page_content": "Goals\n\nThe main purpose of the Index is to provide a comprehensive list of Japanese sword makers with sufficient information given to identify particular smith in Japanese sword literature, look for further references and collect data about smith's work in a form of separate record. It may be useful for the tasks of reading smith's signatures, in-depth research on various schools of sword making, smith's lineage, general interest in the history of Nihont\u014d.\n\nOrigin & Sources\n\nThis index (as many other swordsmith databases in English) is based on 4 most well-known and popular directories of sword smiths:\n\nHawley's Japanese Swordsmiths by W.M.Hawley (English) [1]\n\nT\u014dk\u014d Taikan by Kazuo Tokun\u014d (Japanese) [2]\n\nNihon Toko Jiten by Matsuo Fujishiro (Japanese, English) [3][4]\n\nNihonto Meikan by Junji Honma (Japanese) [5]\n\nW.M.Hawley's book is undoubtedly the most influential so far, due to its importance across English-speaking sword appreciation community, accessibility (written in English) and systematic approach which gives each smith record a unique ID. These IDs became a widely spread point of reference to particular smiths in modern Western sword literature. Due to its popularity Swordsmith Index of Nihonto Club inherits Hawley's IDs where possible.\n\nThis project would never have happened without admirable amount of work put in by the authors and contributors of the first electronic smith databases: To-Show database, JSS/US Nihonto Knowledge Base, Robert Cole's Sho-Shin website and works of many other authors (a complete list can be found in Bibliography section).\n\nHow accurate and complete is the Index?\n\n100% of the Index have been manually verified against at least one of the smith directories listed above. It's possible that some mistakes were made during the data entry. I'm fixing them as soon as they are reported. If you notice any, please leave a comment.\n\nOne of the most important features of the Swordsmith Index is availability of complete references to literature and online resources for almost every piece of information. Japanese swords knowledge and attributions may be highly subjective. It often relies on spurious historical records which were re-invented many centuries ago in order to overstate the prominence of particular blades and smiths. Legends and folklore shouldn't be discounted either.\n\nReliance on the classical sources listed above provides reasonable guarantee of data quality. As a rule of thumb, the more references and individual extant swords are mentioned in the smith record, the more accurate the record is.\n\nIn regards to the coverage, this is an approximate comparison, sorted by size:\n\nHawley's - 30000 records (brief, duplicates and spurious records exist)\n\nNihonto Meikan - 23000 records (brief, w/references, doesn't include modern smiths)\n\nSwordsmith Index - 12300(*) (brief, full text descriptions to grow over time)\n\nT\u014dk\u014d Taikan - 3700 records (short textual information, oshigata)\n\nNihon Toko Jiten - 1500 records (detailed textual information, oshigata, only the most prominent smiths of Koto and Shinto eras)\n\n(*) Note: this number may grow\n\nVerified records usually provide at least as much detail as Hawley's and Meikan. The Index doesn't currently provide good coverage for the smiths which worked after 1930s.\n\nHow to use\n\nSwordsmith Index can be accessed in two ways: Smith List (if you are looking for smith by name, ID, province or Japanese calendar era), Mei Search (if you are looking by signature or parts of signature) and Schools (view by school of sword making).\n\nMei Search in 'contains' mode can search the signature database by any part of the signature, including single characters, both in Kanji and Romaji. It looks for continuous matches, so if you look for 'Musashi Daijo Tadahiro', it will find 'Hizen Kuni ju Musashi Daijo Tadahiro', but not 'Musashi Daijo Fujiwara Tadahiro'. You may use 'Musashi Daijo%Tadahiro' in order to fetch more results. If not found, you may need to reduce the search string further. Search strings are NOT case sensitive.\n\nPlease note that many smiths who used signed with 2 characters will not show up in the mei search due to the lack of information about their work. If you can't find the smith by signature, use the Smith List. If no data was found in the List but you are sure the smith existed, please contact me and I'll do my best to add it into the Index.\n\nPlease take time to get used to the spellings of Japanese names, titles and locations in Nihonto Club. If unsure, make few trial searches to look for examples. E.g. 'daijo', 'mutsu no suke' will fetch results, but 'daijou' and 'mutsu-no-suke' will not. Spelling conventions are intended to be totally uniform across the website, but there may be exceptions. Particle 'no' may sometimes be omitted.\n\nTerms of use\n\nIt is intended to be a non-commercial resource to support Nihonto studies and raise awareness of history and appreciation of genuine Japanese swords.\n\nSwordsmith Index is licensed under Creative Commons License which allows to copy, distribute, transmit and adapt the work freely as long as appropriate attribution is made, the use is non-commercial and any derivative works are licensed under similar terms (for more details see here).

Many of the famous early smiths and school founders were frequently dated in pre-Edo period sword documents to eras like Ei\u00b4en (\u6c38\u5ef6, 987-989). But going back that far is problematic because the transition from the 10th to the 11th century AD marks just the forming of the fully developed nihont\u00f4 as we know it today. And by \u201cfully developed\u201d we speak of a single-edged blade in shinogi-zukuri with a deliberately added sori (i.e. not a sori which is caused by hardening). So late Heian would probably be better to date extant blades of the early smiths concerned. Experts assume that these early datings are mostly simply based on hearsay or on any early neng\u00f4 which sounded appropriate for the author. These early datings would not be such a big deal if not later authors dealt with them in different ways. For example, a Muromachi-period author who was going to compile a meikan record had extant and dated blades and more recent records of sons, grandsons or students of famous smiths which did not comply at all with the early datings of earlier publications. So he had basicall three different options: Correcting the supposed neng\u00f4 arbitrarily to a neng\u00f4 more suitable with extant works and more recent records, keeping the old era and causing a gap of 200 or more years between an ancestor and his sons or students, or filling the gap with invented descendants and students. Well, from a historical point of view, all three approaches are problematic and maybe the best solution would have been the second approach with additional comments like \u201chanded-down date is no longer tenable because \u2026\u201d The worst is of course the third approach and the first approach can cause significant problems too when namely later chroniclers were facing the old and initial records and the already corrected data of some predecessors. This resulted namely often in double-listings.\n\nAnother common practice of chroniclers was to justify very early neng\u00f4 by claiming that the smith in question made swords for a certain high-ranking person or emperor of his time or that a person from then high-society wore a blade by this smith. And this brings us to Kanehira because my aforementioned research was about finding out who owned the \u00d4-Kanehira before the Momoyama-era Ikeda family (\u6c60\u7530). For further details on the Ikeda and their relation to the meibutsu, please see Sat\u00f4, The Japanese Sword p. 94ff. Well, Sat\u00f4 already points out that the previous history of the \u00d4-Kanehira is uncertain and so this article (with reference to Mamiya K\u00f4ji\u00b4s article published in T\u00f4ken-Bijutsu 483, April 1997) should serve mere as demonstration of how difficult and confusing cross-checking historic sword refereces can be. We know today that most pre-Edo period sword publications are more or less transcriptions of earlier documents whereat each copy was usually enlarged with comments. So it takes a chronological approach and we have to start with the earliest extant sword publication which is the Kanchi\u00b4in-bon mei-zukushi (\u89b3\u667a\u9662\u672c\u9298\u5c3d) from \u00d4ei 30 (\u5fdc\u6c38, 1423). Therein we read:\n\nPicture 1: The entry of the Kanchi\u00b4in-bon mei-zukushi.\n\n\u6cf0\u517c\u5e73 \u6cb3\u5185\u570b\u4f4f\u4eba\u3001\u307b\u3046\u3057\u3084\u3046\u306e\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u592a\u5200\u3092\u4f5c\u3001 \u5f8c\u306b\u306f\u5f8c\u9ce5\u7fbd\u9662\u306e\u5fa1\u3064\u308b\u304e\u304b\u307e\u306e\u306f \u304d\u308a\u3068\u304c\u3046\u305b\u3089\u308c\u3001\u53c8\u3046\u305f\u3044\u3057\u3084\u3046\u3051\u306e \u5fa1\u6642\u3064\u306d\u306b\u304b\u308a\u306f\u3091\u5fa1\u51fa\u4e4b\u6642\u3001\u5fa1\u7bb1\u306b \u5165\u308b\u308b\u9593\u3001\u7bb1\u4e38\u3068\u304c\u3046\u3059\u3001\u5176\u5f8c\u3001\u3055\u3044\u307f\u3084\u3046\u3058 \u3069\u306e\u306e\u5fa1\u6642\u3046\u3064\u3057\u304a\u304b\u308c\u3001\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u306e\u3064\u308b\u304e\u3069 \u304c\u3046\u3059\u3001\u3053\u308d\u308c\u306f\u3068\u3046\u3072\u3087\u3046\u3048\u306e\u305c\u3076\u570b\u5409 \u304c\u3055\u304f\u4e5f\u3001\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u592a\u5200\u3001\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3064\u308b\u304e \u304b\u304f\u3078\u3061\u306a\u308a\u3002\n\nImmediately noticeable is that the Kanchi\u00b4in-bon mei-zukushi quotes Kanehira (\u5305\u5e73) with the characters (\u517c\u5e73) and that it uses the character (\u6cf0) for \u201cHata\u201d (\u79e6) (more on this Hata later). Then it reads that he was a resident of Kawachi province and that he made the futokoro-tachi (\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u592a\u5200) of H\u00f4sh\u00f4 (\u307b\u3046\u3057\u3084\u3046). Futokoro-tachi means in this context \u201cbeloved sword\u201d and must not be confused with the small and hidden futokorogatana (\u61d0\u5200). And \u201cH\u00f4sh\u00f4\u201d is the Sino-Japanese reading of the characters for \u201cYasumasa\u201d (\u4fdd\u660c) and refers to the mid Heian noble and poet Fujiwara no Yasumasa (\u85e4\u539f\u4fdd\u660c, 958-1036). Then we read that this beloved sword of H\u00f4sh\u00f4 or Yasumasa respectively came eventually in the possession of the abdicated emperor Gotoba (\u5f8c\u9ce5\u7fbd\u9662, 1183-1198), although it is possible that actually the abdicated emperor Toba (\u9ce5\u7fbd\u9662, 1103-1156) was meant, who nicknamed it \u201cKama no ha-kiri\u201d (\u91dc\u6b6f\u5207). Kama no ha is a pot with an extra wide rim so it seems that the sword cut through such a thing. Then we learn that the sword was owned by the Udaish\u00f4 family (\u3046\u305f\u3044\u3057\u3084\u3046\u3051). \u201cUdaish\u00f4\u201d or \u201cUdaish\u00f4gun\u201d (\u53f3\u5927\u5c06\u8ecd) was another name of Minamoto no Yoritomo (\u6e90\u983c\u671d, 1147-1199). Each time Yoritomo was spending time on his hunting grounds, he put the sword in a special box (hako, \u7bb1) and stored it away and so it got the nickname \u201cHakomaru\u201d (\u7bb1\u4e38). Later the sword was owned by lord Saimy\u00f4ji (\u3055\u3044\u307f\u3084\u3046\u3058), i.e. H\u00f4j\u00f4 Tokiyori (\u5317\u6761\u6642\u983c, 1227-1263) who ordered the smith T\u00f4hy\u00f4e no J\u00f4 Kuniyoshi (\u3068\u3046\u3072\u3087\u3046\u3048\u306e\u305c\u3076\u570b\u5409) to make copy of the sword. \u201cSaimy\u00f4ji\u201d (\u6700\u660e\u5bfa) is the posthumous Buddhist name of Tokiyori and with the smith, Awataguchi Kuniyoshi is meant. So the original was still called futokoro-tachi and the copy futokoro-tsurugi (\u3075\u3068\u3053\u308d\u3064\u308b\u304e).\n\nNow lets tackle the next reference, the \u00d4seki-sh\u00f4 (\u5f80\u6614\u6284) from Eish\u00f4 16 (\u6c38\u6b63, 1519). The entry therein is insofar precious because it comes with a drawing of a nakago which is signed \u201cBuzen no Kuni Kanehira\u201d (\u5099\u524d\u56fd\u5305\u5e73). Please note that the character for \u201cKuni\u201d is not just abbreviated in this drawing because Kanehira actually signed that way, seen in the picture to the right which is the mei of the \u00d4-Kanehira. So the \u00d4seki-sh\u00f4 writes next to the tang:\n\nPicture 2, left: The entry of the \u00d4seki-sh\u00f4; right: mei of the meibutsu \u00d4-Kanehira\n\n\u5cef\u89d2\u30cb\u5c0f\u8089\u30a2\u30ea\u3001\u9229\u6a2a\u3001\u5e2f\u9762\u5263\u4e8c\u30c4\u9577\u30af\u30e4\u30ea\u3001\u516b\u5e61\u5927\u83e9\u85a9\u30c8\u5263\u30ce\u4e0a\u30cb\u30a2\u30ea\u68b5\u5b57\u4e8c\u30c4\u6709 \u53f3\u5fa1\u592a\u5200\u4eca\u51fa\u5ddd\u6bbf\u69d8\u5fa1\u4e0a\u6d1b\u4e4b\u6642\u3001\u6301\u662f\u9662\u516c\u6027\u30cb\u4e0b\u30b5\u30ec\u30b7\u5fa1\u5263\u4e5f\u3001\u5305\u5e73\u30cf\u6cb3\u5185\u4f4f\u30cb\u30c6\u5019 \u7136\u30eb\u30cb\u6b64\u592a\u5200\u30cf\u5099\u524d\u3068\u5728\u4e4b\u4e0d\u9650\u5305\u5e73\u30cb\u4ed6\u56fd\u30d8\u884c\u30c6\u6253\u30c4\u4e8b\u985e\u591a\u5728\u4e4b\u7269\u3001\u6839\u5143\u30cf \u5099\u524d\u30ab\u30c1\u4e5f\u3001\u5f8c\u6cb3\u5185\u30cb\u4f4f\u30b9\u30c8\u4e91\u3005\n\nThe blade has a kaku-mune with ko-niku, kiri-yasurime, shows two long (su)ken on the haki-omote and bonji over the characters of Hachiman-Daibosatsu and another (su)ken on the ura side. When lord Jizei\u00b4in (\u6301\u662f\u9662), i.e. Sait\u00f4 My\u00f4jun (\u658e\u85e4\u5999\u7d14, ?-1497), proceeded to Ky\u00f4to, he was presented with this sword by the noble Imadegawa family (\u4eca\u51fa\u5ddd). Then it is stated that Kanehira lived in Kawachi province but that this tachi was made when he was in Bizen and that the smith worked also in other regions. And finally it is written that Kanehira was originally a Bizen smith and that he moved later in his career to Kawachi.\n\nPicture 3: The entry of the Genki-gannen t\u00f4ken-mekiki-sho.\n\nOur next source is the Genki-gannen t\u00f4ken-mekiki-sho (\u5143\u4e80\u5143\u5e74\u5200\u5294\u76ee\u5229\u66f8) from the first year of Genki (\u5143\u4e80, 1570).

Note that the entry states d\u00f4-gyo\u00b4u (\u540c\u5fa1\u5b87), lit. \u201csame reign\u201d, which refers to the previous entry. Then we read that he was a resident of Kawachi and of Bizen but that he did not sign with \u201cHata\u201d when in Bizen province. His tangs taper from both the mune and ha side, show kiri-yasurime, and a somewhat roundish nakago-jiri. Tachi are signed above the mekugi-ana and katana below of the mekugi-ana, whereat katana refers here probably to koshigatana or similar smaller sized blades. One blade was the beloved sword of Fujiwara no Yasumasa with came then in the possession of the abdicated emperor Toba who nicknamed it \u201cKama no ha\u201d. Then the same legend with Minamoto no Yoritomo follows but with the difference that the sword was stored away behind a bamboo screen (misu) and was thus caled \u201cMisu-maru\u201d (\u7c3e\u4e38). And later on, H\u00f4j\u00f4 Tokiyori had Awataguchi Kuniyoshi make a copy of the sword which was called futokoro-ken and the original of Kanehira futokoro-tachi. So without a few exceptions, the Genki-gannen t\u00f4ken-mekiki-sho follows faithfully the Kanchi\u00b4in-bon mei-zukushi.\n\nAnd last I want to introduce the data of the Kokon-mei-zukushi (\u53e4\u4eca\u9298\u5c3d) published in Manji four (\u4e07\u6cbb, 1661). This work first separates Ko-Bizen Kanehira and Kawachi Kanehira strictly in its genealogy section but only to address later on both smiths again in one the the same entry. So in the first volume which deals basically with genealogies we find Kanehira in the Ko-Bizen genealogy in an individual entry next to Nobufusa (\u4fe1\u623f). In this entry he is listed with the neng\u00f4 J\u00f4h\u00f4 (\u627f\u4fdd, 1074-1077), J\u00f4ryaku (\u627f\u66a6, 1077-1081), Eih\u00f4 (\u6c38\u4fdd, 1081-1084), \u00d4toku (\u5fdc\u5fb3, 1084-1087), Kanji (\u5bdb\u6cbb, 1087-1094), and Kah\u00f4 (\u5609\u4fdd, 1094-1096). And the other Kanehira is introduced several pages earlier along the Kawachi section but just with the comment yoko-yasuri (i.e. kiri-yasurime) and his successors being Arikuni (\u6709\u570b), who was originally from Yamato province, Arinari (\u6709\u6210), and Aritsuna (\u6709\u7db1) (see picture 4).\n\nPicture 4: The genealogic entries from the first volume of the Kokon-mei-zukushi. Left the Ko-Bizen entry, right the Kawachi entry.\n\nIn volume 2 both Kanehira appear side by side in the section about smiths of the same name working in different provinces and not being the same persons. Then later in volume 2 we find some details on the Kanehira from Kawachi province. The entry in question reads:\n\n\u79e6\u5305\u5e73 \u4e00\u6761\u9662\u306e\u5fa1\u5b87\u6cb3\u5185\u570b\u5f8c\u306b\u5099\u524d\u306b\u4f4f\u3059\u6c38\u5ef6\u306e\u6bd4\u3088\u308a\u6176\u9577 \u516b\u5e74\u8fc4\u516d\u767e\u5341\u4e94\u5e74\n\nHata Kanehira, active during the reign of emperor Ichij\u00f4, lived in Kawachi province but moved later to Bizen, from around Ei\u00b4en onwards which is about 615 years in Keich\u00f4 eight (\u6176\u9577, 1603) [i.e. when the data for the Kokon-mei-zukushi was copiled before it was pubished about sixty years later.]\n\nSo according to this entry, we are talking about the same smith who started in Kawachi but moved later in his career to Bizen province. An entry in volume 4 deals with the workmanship of Kanehira and in this entry, both smiths are again separated, but read it for yourself:\n\nPicture 5: The entry of the fourth volume of the Kokon-mei-zukushi.\n\n\u4e00\u3001\u5305\u5e73 \u6c38\u5ef6\u6bd4 \u592a\u5200\u306e\u59ff\u307b\u305d\u304f\u5207\u5148\u3064\u309e\u307e\u3084\u304b\u306b\u5eb5\u4e18\u935b \u67fe\u76ee\u3044\u304b\u306b\u3082\u3053\u307e\u304b\u4e5f\u3002\u5730\u8272\u9ed2\u304f\u3002\u7d2b\u8272\u3042\u308a\u3002\u5c0f\u4e71\u5204\u3092\u713c \u3044\u304b\u306b\u307e\u5c0f\u8db3\u306a\u308a\u3002\u5730\u3056\u304b\u3072\u6c88\u3066\u898b\u3086\u308b\u4e5f\u3002\u5204\u3092\u3072\u308d\u304f\u3001\u6cb8 \u3092\u713c\u305f\u308b\u3082\u3042\u308a\u3002\u5099\u524d\u570b\u5305\u5e73\u3068\u6253\u305f\u308b\u3092\u6cb3\u5185\u935b\u51b6\u3068 \u3044\u3075\u4e8b\u5982\u4f55\u3002\u53e4\u5099\u524d\u306a\u308b\u3079\u3057\u3002\u4e8c\u5b57\u9298\u306e\u5305\u5e73\u306f\u6cb3\u5185\u570b \u79e6\u5305\u5e73\u306a\u308b\u3079\u3057\u3002\u51fa\u6765\u3084\u3046\u5ee3\u76f4\u5204\u306b\u6cb8\u591a\u3057\u3002\u8170\u672c\u3092 \u4e71\u5204\u306b\u3046\u3064\u304f\u3057\u304f\u713c\u3066\u5c0b\u5e38\u4e5f\u3002\u6765\u570b\u884c\u306a\u3069\u306b\u4f3c\u305f\u308a\u3002 \u5730\u8272\u3082\u8d64\u304f\u7d2b\u8272\u3042\u308a\u3002\u5204\u8272\u767d\u3057\u3001\u5099\u524d\u5305\u5e73\u306f\u5204\u8272\u3082 \u305d\u3068\u9752\u307f\u6709\u3066\u4e0a\u767d\u3057\u3002\u6cb8\u306e\u5fc3\u3082\u3053\u307e\u304b\u4e5f\u3002\u80fd\u3005\u5fc3\u3092\u4ed8\u3066 \u898b\u3079\u3057\n\n\u201cKanehira: Around Ei\u00b4en. His tachi-sugata is slender, tapers, and shiows an iori-mune. The kitae is a fine masame and the steel is blackish bit also purple. He tempered a ko-midareba with ko-ashi and the nioiguchi is rather subdued. The ha is white and shows nie. He signed with \u201cBizen no Kuni Kanehira\u201d but it is also said that he was a Kawachi smith, but works signed that way are from the Ko-Bizen smith. All niji-mei must be attributed to Hata Kanehira from Kawachi province. He tempered a hiro-suguha with plentiful of nie and usually a midareba at the base. This interpretation is similar to Rai Kuniyuki. The steel is reddish and purple and the ha is white but the ha of Bizen Kanehira is more blueish white. The nie are also finer and he [Bizen Kanehira] has to be regarded as superior.\u201d\n\nWhat is my conclusion? Well, this is a case where not just one odd document forwards a different theory and all others are in unison about the origins of a certain smith. Here we have too many ambiguous entries on the basis of which we just can\u00b4t rule out one approach or the other. That means everything is possible, i.e. that Kanehira moved from Bizen to Hata in Kawachi province, that he originated in Kawachi and moved to Bizen and gave up there signing with \u201cHata,\u201d or that we are facing two completely different smiths. Also I can\u00b4t say for sure of the \u00d4-Kanehira was the futokoro-tachi owned by Fujiwara no Yasumasa as it is suggested by some experts. But the T\u00f4ky\u00f4 National Museum which owns the blade today dates it to the late Heian period and says 12th century. So not middle Heian and close to Yasumasa. I hope though that I was able to illustrate how hard it can be to rely on old references and that sometimes like here you have to stop at a certain point because you can\u00b4t squeeze out more information from them. And now imagine how much work it was to compile my Index of Japanese Swordsmiths where I tried for the first time to bring in line all this data by keeping at the same time as much original content as possible. Sometimes it needed just a keyhole surgery, but sometimes three patients were lying side by side with their bodies opened and you just don\u00b4t know which organ to transplant where.\n\nPicture 6: tachi, kokuh\u00f4, mei \u201cBizen no Kuni Kanehira saku\u201d, meibutsu \u00d4-Kanehira, nagasa 89,2 cm, sori 3.5 cm, motohaba 3.7 cm.

He is the third son of Sukasa (father) and Saki (mother) Ono. He took interest in Japanese swords while in school. In 1969 he joined the swordsmith studio of Yoshindo and Shoji Yoshihara. By March 1975 he received his swordsmith\u2019s license from the agency of Cultural Affairs. In the same year he was awarded for excellence (Doryoku Sh\u00f4) at the 11th Shinsaku-meitoten (The Annual Exhibition of Modern Swords held at the Japanese Art Sword Museum ).\n\nIn March of 1976 Yoshimitsu opened his own forge in Kurosaki City , Niigata . The following year he married his wife Yoshikawa Kazue made a home with her in Tokyo .\n\nFro m the 11th Shinsaku-meitoten in 1976 to the 15th in 1980, he won the award for effort every year. The following year (1981) at the Shinsaku-meitoten he received the award for excellence (Y\u00fbsh\u00fb Sh\u00f4). In 1982 at the 17th Shinsaku-meitoten he won the Prince Takamatsu award (Takamatsu-no-miya Sh\u00f4). Yoshimitsu th en went on to win the Chairman of the Agency for Cultural Affairs awa rd (Bunkach\u00f4 Ch\u00f4kan Sh\u00f4) i n 1983. For the following four years (1984-1987) he went on to win the Prince Takamatsu aw ard (Takamatsu-no-miya Sh\u00f4) e ach year.\n\nIn 1984 Yoshimitsu received invitation from Japan \u2019s premier shine, Ise Shrine, to make a sacred sword for the shrine\u2019s 61st shrine reconstruction ceremonies. From his past success at the annual sword exhibition, in 1987 he was promoted to the rank of Mukansa * , and has displayed swords in the Mukansa category every year since. In 1989 Yoshimitsu received yet another invitation from the Ise shrine to make a sacred spear for the ceremonies of the 61st reconstruction of the shrine.\n\nYoshikawa Mitsuo chose the sword smith name of Yoshimitsu. He did this by using one character from his teacher\u2019s name ( \u7fa9 ) as customary in Japanese traditional arts. He added \u00d4no to his signature after the creation of his forge in \u00d4no at Kurozaski, in 1976.\n\nYoshimitsu's favorite sword is the national treasure / Meibutsu Yamatorige, and his goal is emulating this style of complex Ch\u00f4ji and elegant Sugata. However, he also works in other styles, but always tries to capture the spirit of a famous sword rather than making an outright copy. His swords are mostly Nioi-deki with Ko-nie, Ashi and Y\u00f4, and he frequently produces Utsuri.\n\n* . Mukansa meaning: \"without judgment\", meaning that his swords are of such a high level that they are displayed at the annual contemporary sword smith exhibition without examination of a panel of judges; no further awards will be granted, since the swords are above competition."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/24/mark-e-smith-obituary", "page_content": "Of all the fascinating musical offshoots that sprang from mid-70s punk rock, the Fall proved the strangest and most durable. The group was a vehicle for the singer and lyricist Mark E Smith, who has died aged 60 after an extended period of ill health, including respiratory problems.\n\n\n\nHe formed the Fall after seeing the Sex Pistols perform their famous concert at the Lesser Free Trade Hall, Manchester, in June 1976. This became dubbed \u201cthe gig that changed the world\u201d, because, as well as Smith, it was witnessed by future members of Joy Division, the Smiths and Buzzcocks, who all left with a burning urge to create their own band.\n\nSmith assembled the Fall in his home town of Prestwich later that year. Aside from the inspirational spark of the Sex Pistols, the band cited the German group Can and the Velvet Underground as chief influences, both of whom fully exploited the hypnotic power of repetition as a stylistic device. One of the Fall\u2019s early songs was even called Repetition \u2013 \u201cthe three Rs are repetition, repetition, repetition,\u201d lectured Smith. A fondness for rockabilly was also discernible in their early work, earning them the label Country & Northern from fans.\n\nHowever, while Smith would remain the band\u2019s constant central factor for more than 40 years, his musicians fell by the wayside, often not voluntarily. During the group\u2019s career, Smith performed with a total of 66 band members. One of them was Marc Riley, now a DJ on BBC Radio 6, who was sacked by Smith on his wedding day in the early 80s.\n\n\n\nThis video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason. \u2018Riot in righteousness\u2019: Mark E Smith dies aged 60 \u2013 video obituary\n\nThough Smith was notoriously difficult to work with, his acidic tone, deadpan black humour and unswervingly confrontational attitude (fuelled by his copious intake of alcohol) lay at the heart of his perverse appeal. In 1998, his violent mood-swings briefly landed him in jail in New York after he was charged with assaulting the keyboard player Julia Nagle. He was sent back to the UK for rehab.\n\nSmith never viewed commercial success as his prime objective, but the Fall\u2019s tally of 31 studio albums and 32 live albums represented a kind of triumph in itself. They topped the UK independent album chart with Grotesque (After the Gramme) in 1980 and again with Perverted By Language (1983), Reformation Post TLC (2007) and Your Future Our Clutter (2010), and occasionally flirted with wider chart success. The Frenz Experiment (1988) reached 19 on the mainstream album chart, Shift-Work (1991) went to 17, and in 1993 The Infotainment Scan climbed to No 9.\n\nThough Smith\u2019s tuneless, declamatory delivery and the group\u2019s clattering, grinding rhythms generally made them the antidote to singles bands, the Fall nonetheless scored high on the indie chart with such singles as Totally Wired, How I Wrote \u201cElastic Man\u201d and Kicker Conspiracy, and even had a genuine Top 30 hit in 1987 with a cover of R Dean Taylor\u2019s 60s classic, There\u2019s a Ghost in My House.\n\nSmith\u2019s work defied categorisation, combining as it did elements of satire, social commentary, grumbling misanthropy and an abiding enthusiasm for cunning wordplay. The range of his references seemed to know no bounds, and took in literature, philosophy, the occult and football. How I Wrote \u201cElastic Man\u201d (1980) put listeners inside the mind of a struggling writer burdened by the albatross of his past success. In It\u2019s a Curse (1993), Smith took an oblique but caustic swipe at music critics. Gross Chapel \u2013 British Grenadiers (1986) was an extraordinarily menacing piece partly constructed from the old British Grenadiers marching song. In Rowche Rumble (1979), he delivered a furious rant about tranquillisers made by the Swiss drug company Roche. Theme From Sparta FC (2003) was a punchy battle hymn for the obscure Greek football team of the title \u2013 Smith\u2019s third wife, Elena Poulou, is Greek \u2013 complete with fake-bouzouki sounds. The slow, bluesy Hip Priest (1982) might have been autobiographical, while also sounding like a parody of Jim Morrison and the Doors.\n\nBorn in Broughton, Salford, to Irene (nee Brownhill) and Jack Smith, Mark moved to Prestwich with his family while he was young. His father was a plumber who had served in the Black Watch infantry regiment at the end of the second world war, and had an ancestor who fought at the battle of Rorke\u2019s Drift during the Anglo-Zulu war.\n\nHe passed his 11-plus and went to Stand grammar school, but quit at 16 and took a job as a shipping clerk on Salford docks. At night, he took an A-level class in literature and numbered Kurt Vonnegut, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell and HP Lovecraft among his favourite authors (the Fall was named after the Albert Camus novel La Chute). He took an interest in politics and, after a spell as a Labour supporter, veered further left and joined the Socialist Workers party. This never stopped him from expressing illiberal or conservative views.\n\nThe Fall\u2019s first live show, with the original fellow band members Una Baines (Smith\u2019s then partner), Tony Friel and Martin Bramah, and Steve Ormrod as the very short-lived first drummer, was in the basement of the North West Arts office on King Street, Manchester, on 23 May 1977, and their first recordings appeared on a Virgin Records compilation called Short Circuit: Live at the Electric Circus. Their first single, It\u2019s the New Thing, was released by Step Forward Records in November 1978, and their debut album Live at the Witch Trials followed in April 1979.\n\nTheir career would be for ever associated with the DJ John Peel, a staunch supporter for whom the Fall recorded 24 radio sessions between 1978 and 2004, though Peel and Smith never became close. \u201cMe and John had an agreement,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe never were friends or anything like that.\u201d\n\nIn 1983, Smith married the American guitarist Brix Smith (born Laura Salenger, now Brix Smith Start), whose tenure with the Fall helped move them in a more polished and commercial direction. Before she left both her husband and the band in 1989, they had enjoyed both critical and commercial success with albums such as The Wonderful and Frightening World of the Fall, This Nation\u2019s Saving Grace, Bend Sinister, and especially, The Frenz Experiment, all on the Beggars Banquet label.\n\nIn 1986 Smith also found the time to write a play, Hey, Luciani, on Pope John Paul I, which ran for two weeks at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, starring Smith and the performance artist Leigh Bowery. He then went on to write the music for the Michael Clark ballet I Am Curious, Orange, recorded as the Fall album I Am Kurious Oranj (1988).\n\nDuring the 90s, as the Fall enjoyed more success with albums including Shift-Work, Code: Selfish and Middle Class Revolt, Smith undertook a variety of guest roles. He featured on the D.O.S.E. single Plug Myself In (1996) and collaborated on projects with Elastica, the Clint Boon Experience, Edwyn Collins and Long Fin Killie. He made his first appearance on Top of the Pops when he performed with Inspiral Carpets on their 1994 hit I Want You.\n\nHis first solo album, The Post Nearly Man, was released in 1998, and his second, Pander! Panda! Panzer!, in 2002. He formed Von Sudenfed with the electronic duo Mouse on Mars, and they released the album Tromatic Reflexxions (2007). With Mark Blaney, he made the albums Smith and Blaney (2008) and The Train Part Three (2009), and he appeared on Gorillaz\u2019 album Plastic Beach (2010).\n\nIn 2005, BBC4 aired the documentary The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World of Mark E Smith. Three years later, Smith published an autobiography, Renegade: The Lives and Tales of Mark E Smith, written in collaboration with Austin Collins.\n\nSmith\u2019s second marriage, to Saffron Prior, ended in 1995. He married Elena in 2001. She became the Fall\u2019s keyboard player the following year, but left in 2016. The Fall had continued to make albums at a remarkable rate, The Unutterable (2000) being the first of 11 over the next 17 years, concluding with New Facts Emerge (2017)."}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52576578-the-sword-falls", "page_content": "I received an advanced copy of A.J. Smith\u2019s The Sword Falls, in exchange for an honest review.\n\n\n\nA man of the Dawn Claw will be the Always King. It will ever be so. They will always rule\u2026 but they will not always lead\u2026\n\n\n\nPrince Oliver Dawn Claw, heir to the throne, has been sent to the Silver Parliament, to see if he will be accepted as King, when his father dies.\n\n\n\nOn his journey to the Silver Parliament, escorted by his allies, Silver Jack and Quinn, he meets the Commander of Falcon\u2019s watch. All three swear their lives to protect the Prince.\n\n\n\nBut will their vows be enough to protect the future Always King, from corruption that could turn him\u2026.?!\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Adeline Brand, the Alpha Wolf, soon to be First Fang, isn\u2019t prepared to wait to be attacked. She assembles a crew of allies. Sea Wolves, kneeling Wolves, Sundered Wolved and Pure Ones. Aboard the Halfdan\u2019s Revenge, Adeline sails through the void, taking the fight to the Sunken God.\n\n\n\nAdeline\u2026long ago the Great Phoenix predicted your arrival. Michael of the mountain was told that you would lead us away from spirits. You would take the black dust and lead us towards peace.\n\n\n\nBut can Adeline escape her own Spirit, The Old Bitch of the Sea, form an unlikely alliance, and save the world of Form?\n\n\n\nThe book carries on in the same style as the first book. We see through the eyes of the two main characters. Adeline the Alpha Wolf, and this time Oliver Dawn Claw, who replaces Duncan after he died saving Oliver at the Severed Hand in the first book. Personally I like this style of writing. Similar to how John Gwynne writes the Faithful and the Fallen series. I find you get to know the characters more when you spend more time seeing through their eyes. The relationships between Adeline and her allies are extremely believable. Struggling to be taken seriously as the First Fang after killing the previous leader, she relies on old friends who remain close at her side, until she can win over the other Sea Wolves.\n\n\n\nI also love how A.J. Smith builds the world through his vivid, flowing descriptions. I could read this all day long! This fantastic descriptive writing continues into the battles towards the end of the book. The Sunken Men attacking Last Port, and Adeline using the Black dust to try to overcome the Sunken Men aboard their depth barges. Smith isn\u2019t afraid of killing off a main character, or vividly describing a captain having his leg amputated. The only issue is I loved these gruesome battles so much, that I wish there were more of them in the book. As well as more time spent in the Void, navigating their way past the strange creatures that live there. I could have happily read chapter after chapter in this world, or in these battles, but these chapters were few and far between.\n\n\n\nMy only other gripe with this book was the description of the Sunken Men. Big frogs spewing corrosive frogspawn! I really feel Smith could have been more imaginative here, and create a evil foe slightly more frightening than a big frog.\n\n\n\nBut I am being picky! The Sword Falls was a great second installment of the Form and Void series. The ending twists leave me gagging for the third book Any book that finishes on a cliff hanger that I can\u2019t stop thinking about for days, is a massive success .\n\n\n\n4/5\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10583-022-09509-5", "page_content": "The Serrailliers, in their work at New Windmill, revealed their understanding of the liminality of the territory between adult and child. Indeed, a central theme within The Silver Sword is the shifting boundaries between adult and childhood-states: at some points in the narrative, Ruth\u2019s maturity and resilience makes her appear as essentially the adult of the party, yet, when we view her through the eyes of others, she reverts to being a child. Another example of these blurred boundaries is in the relationship between the children and the adults they encounter, as the chaos of war subverts received notions and constructions of childhood in the hierarchy of age. Although the wartime setting of The Silver Sword certainly magnifies these confusions, the Serrailliers believed more generally that children on the cusp of adulthood required a particular sort of book. As Karen Sands-O\u2019Connor observes, the New Windmill Series was \u201cone of the earliest imprints to publish and promote books specifically for the teen audience\u201d (2017, p.20). The trajectory of the list was such that, having started by predominantly publishing books written for children, albeit at the older end of the spectrum, by the middle of the 1960s, a significant proportion of the list was made up of books originally published as adult novels.\n\nIn a file within the New Windmill Archive, dated between 1949 and 1955, is a cutting from The School Librarian journal. Entitled \u201cThe Future of School Libraries\u201d, it highlights the fact that there were now some 3000 Secondary Modern schools in the UK. The Education Act of 1944 stipulated the need to equip these schools with school libraries, which meant the largest ever provision of its kind. This obviously provided huge scope for publishing companies such as Heinemann to meet the demand for titles that would, alongside educating pupils, support children\u2019s hobbies and interests. As a handwritten report from Ian Serraillier (written in 1949) reveals, the provision of reading material for schools was less than inspiring. A number of publishers, including Ginn, Methuen, John Murray, Harraps, Longman, and Blackwell, sold educational series but the quality of production was poor and the selection of titles unimaginative. Serraillier\u2019s assessment of this material included damning comments such as \u201cabout the level of the \u201ctwopenny blood\u201d, \u201ccrudely drawn and reproduced\u201d, \u201cpoor binding and abominable blocking\u201d, \u201cGod knows what intelligent questions one could set on such texts!\u201d, \u201cClassic juvenile novels, collections of fables, etc. Poorly printed, ordinary binding\u201d.\n\nThe idea behind New Windmill was to provide fresh and engaging literature for secondary school age children (11\u201316 age range). These editions were, importantly, designed to look like novels, rather than school reading books \u2013 there were no notes or comprehension questions at the end. Alan Hill and Tony Beal, directors of Heinemann, worked with the Serrailliers to establish New Windmill as one of the key players in educational publishing. Hill recalled Serraillier\u2019s approach: \u201cFrom the start, in fact, Ian deliberately extended the series beyond the middle class world of Arthur Ransome, whose Swallows and Amazons was outsold five times over by Sylvia Sherry\u2019s A Pair of Jesus Boots - a story of the back streets of Liverpool today\u201d(1988, p.84). This impetus reflects the Serrailliers\u2019 recognition of the need to provide teenage audiences with books with timely, contemporary themes which would be of immediate appeal. The fact that, for example, A Pair of Jesus Boots was so successful at the time of its publication but is now out of print does not undermine its significance but rather speaks to the way in which many of these titles tapped into the contemporary concerns and interests of readers within a specific period. As Lucy Pearson observes, in her study of Aidan Chambers\u2019 Topliner imprint for adolescent readers, \u201cbooks which dealt directly with the experience of being a teenager in the 1970s were quick to date\u201d (2013, p.165).\n\nBoth Ian and Anne read extensively, and were continually on the lookout for potential New Windmill titles. There was a two-way stream of books which travelled between the Serrailliers\u2019 cottage in Singleton, West Sussex, and the Heinemann offices in London. The Serrailliers would often write to request copies of books they had heard good things about; Beal and Hill would, similarly, send books to them for their opinion. It was a time-consuming process, particularly when one recalls that Ian was still teaching, and Anne had four children to look after. Blurbs were written, and other opinions sought from colleagues and pupils \u2013 the Serrailliers capitalising on their position as teachers and parents to secure reviews from young readers. In some cases, correspondence with authors was required, as well as negotiations over royalties, illustrations and cover design. The Serrailliers were involved in all aspects of the publication process and were keenly aware of the financial pressures that needed to be met in order to make the list profitable.\n\nTo add to the workload, there was, in many cases, considerable labour involved in editing manuscripts to make them suitable for the series. Editorial files for each title contain lists of proposed cuts and changes that were required, for reasons of length and/or content. Some of these adjustments were relatively clear cut, and combined the need to reduce the length of books as well as ensuring their contents would be suitable for the intended audience. For example, Serraillier wrote of Tschiffely\u2019s Ride (A. F. Tschiffely): \u201cI propose to omit whole chunks which would not be of interest to children, reducing the book to about half its present length.[\u2026] Schoolchildren will not be interested in the lengthier descriptions and much of the lore, and the references to prostitution and suchlike would have to go\u201d (1949).\n\nWith so many facets to the role, it would have been understandable had the Serrailliers bowed to pressure and been less exacting about some of their choices for the list. However, their crystal-clear vision of what was and wasn\u2019t a New Windmill book was matched only by their absolute focus on the audience for whom they were catering. It was not straightforward. Not only did the Serrailliers have to keep in mind the differences between a reader at the bottom end of their age range (11 years old) and at the top (16 years old) and the progress between the two, but also the adult gatekeepers of this material: the teachers. With school budgets tight (it was ever thus), teachers had to be sure that the books they chose were right for their students. The element of trust was vital to the success of an educational list: one wrong choice would potentially dissuade teachers from putting their faith \u2013 and their precious funds \u2013 in a list, no matter how appealing their catalogue might be.\n\nThe Serrailliers had not only to consider whether their young readers would enjoy a book, but also whether their teachers would be happy to have it in their class libraries. This assessment of a book under consideration in 1972 \u2013 The Thundering Good Today (J.M. Cooper) - encapsulates much of what Ian Serraillier believed in terms of the audience New Windmill was aiming for:\n\nThe appeal of this salty and lively novel is to \u201cyoung adults\u201d, thoughtful, questioning, intelligent, of the calibre to study for \u201cA\u201d levels [\u2026] 15+, with some political awareness, disillusioned with society as at present organised and anxious to explore new ways of doing things, and new solutions, conscious too of the gap that yawns between themselves and the older generation, having to follow along the accepted grooves of examination-passing, and wanting to make a hit with their girl-friends when they feel they ought perhaps to be at their books, studying.\u201d (1972)\n\nDespite his appreciation of the book\u2019s qualities, however, Serraillier expressed doubts that the all-important second audience \u2013 the teachers \u2013 would react in a similarly positive way to the book. He asked, \u201cHow many teachers are going to write in objecting to the number of times the word \u201ccrap\u201d is used (v.frequent) or \u201cbugger\u201d, (less frequent), quite unimpressed by the fact that is the way that many 15 plus-ers speak\u2026\u201d The title was, with regret, rejected. On other occasions, however, the Serrailliers judged that the benefits of publishing a more challenging, \u201csalty\u201d book outweighed the risks of alienating teachers, and their instincts were generally strong. There were, inevitably, occasional complaints. Despite being aware of the need to reassure teachers whilst engaging teenage readers, sometimes they had to defend their choices. In 1969, Ian Serraillier responded to a letter of complaint received from a Scottish teacher regarding a book called A River Ran out of Eden, and its appropriateness for her pupils. He acknowledged that: \u201cThere is a wide range of views among teachers as to where the line should be drawn between \u201csuitable and unsuitable\u201d books for these near-adult readers.\u201d It is interesting to note here the use of \u201cnear-adult\u201d as another definition of this age group: it is adjacent to the now well-defined Young Adult market. Serraillier goes on to defend the selection of this book: \u201c\u2026we feel that it is a highly moral tale, emphasising as it does the author\u2019s reverence for life in general, and for family life in particular. It also places a high value on truth and integrity in personal relationships. It does, certainly, treat the reader as a mature person\u2026\u201d(1969). Serraillier\u2019s concern that The Silver Sword was not to be seen as glorifying violence is echoed here: adult themes are present for a reason, rather than simply providing cheap thrills.\n\nAlthough, as this letter demonstrates, the Serrailliers did make decisions with adults in mind, they also took pains to ensure that the books they chose would appeal to contemporary child readers, rather than relying on their own memories of what they enjoyed as children. For example, Anne Serraillier gave her assessment of Anne of Green Gables to Tony Beal, having consulted with her own young daughters: \u201cI am convinced that it is too cosy and corny by half for modern readers, and Helen and Jane confirm that it is \u201csoppy\u201d. Anne is too often \u201cdeliciously athrill with excitement\u201d. I fear I must have been a soppy child to have lapped this up so uncritically\u201d (1961). When selecting titles, the Serrailliers applied judgements about the age, gender, and interests of their potential readers. For example, recommending My Mother\u2019s House by Colette in 1967, Ian Serraillier comments: \u201cThis is real literature, marvellous stuff, and can be recommended for mature readers of both sexes, but especially girls of a literary bent who enjoy true stories of happy family life\u201d (1967).\n\nOf course, the New Windmill series was not unique in having to split its allegiance between two audiences. Any publisher producing children\u2019s books needs to acknowledge this duality: adults as well as children are their customers, regardless of who ultimately reads the book. For school lists such as New Windmill, it is even more complex, however. Particularly in the earlier years of the list\u2019s existence, books that were deemed acceptable for private reading were more questionable when considered for use in the classroom. The editorial file for Enid Bagnold\u2019s National Velvet is a clear example of this process. When the title was proposed for inclusion in New Windmill, Ian Serraillier suggested that various cuts would be needed, and approval was sought from the author. Bagnold reacted vociferously to this, however, refusing to alter any aspect of the text. She objected to the suggestion that words such as \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201cblast\u201d should be removed, as well as references to characters being naked to the waist. Her argument was that as parents professed to love the book, there was no reason that teachers should be allowed to censor it.\n\nIan Serraillier\u2019s response was philosophical and acknowledged the issue from a teacher\u2019s perspective:\n\nOf course, boys and girls read the Penguin of this book and take it in their stride. I should have no hesitation in giving it to any boy or girl to read as it stands. But to a teacher reading it aloud in a mixed class or using it as a reader, these are obvious objections. What is the standard which you, as publisher, wish to adopt? Teachers\u2019 opinions will differ. Are you prepared to take the risk of letters objecting to damn\u2019s, blast\u2019s, hells and so on? or does it get a bad name for the series and put teachers off and affect sales? (1953)\n\nNational Velvet was published as a New Windmill, but this assessment reflects the continuous balancing act that the list needed to achieve: it had to compete for young readers\u2019 attention with popular paperbacks, but its titles also had to earn their place on a class library shelf \u2013 and they had to sell in sufficient numbers to cover the costs of production, and make a profit. Fortunately, although the scope of the list did not change over the years \u2013 if anything, its ambitions grew - the parameters of what was deemed acceptable did. Evidence from correspondence shows that attitudes to censorship were subject to change, according to mores of the day. By 1964, Ian Serraillier, giving his approval to To Kill A Mockingbird, commented: \u201cAt the upper end of our age group we think Windmills should reflect the earlier maturity of their readers today, and while keeping a sense of responsibility we should not be too quick on the draw with the blue pencil.\u201d The book\u2019s \u201chumanitarian attitude and very sound values throughout can have only a beneficial effect upon young readers, and it would be a great pity to reject the book for fear the fifteen references to rape might offend the prudish\u201d (1964). Four years later, Tony Beal reinforced this view: \u201cas the years go by the amount of expurgation necessary becomes less and less \u2013 until now we are astonished at some of the things we thought we had to cut out a few years ago\u201d (1968).\n\nIn the same letter, Beal sets out the broad aims of the New Windmill series: \u201cto provide good contemporary reading for the 11\u201316 age group\u201d. He discusses the challenges they faced in sourcing appropriate titles written particularly for children, although he adds that another difficulty is that \u201cchildren stop being children at about 11 and expect to read adult books.\u201d This contention raises interesting questions about the potential disconnect between how children view their passage to adulthood and how this transition is perceived by adults. The audience for the New Windmill Series becomes more complicated when considered through this dual lens, and it echoes Serraillier\u2019s portrayal of his young protagonists in The Silver Sword: \u201cThey were to endure hardships and conditions which made them think and plan and act more like adults than children.\u201d (1956 p.1). As Serraillier portrays in The Silver Sword, children, particularly in wartime (although not exclusively), were forced into situations where they had to confront danger and uncomfortable realities that might otherwise be associated with adulthood: hunger, the need to physically defend oneself, to make difficult decisions and to decide who to trust and who to fear. Here the lines between child and adult are certainly not clear cut."}], "The Hound of Merin was published in 2002.": [{"url": "https://www.brandonsanderson.com/way-of-kings-prime-chapter-5-merin-2/", "page_content": "This is a chapter from the original 2002 draft of The Way of Kings. The 2010 published version was completely rewritten.\n\nThree days after the battle, clinging to his horse\u2019s saddle as the ground blurred by below, Merin had cause to regret his oath to Lord Dalenar. Every hoofbeat jostled, threatening to hurl him to the deadly stones below. White-knuckled, he gripped the saddle and whispered lines from The Arguments\u2014inside, however, he doubted it would help. The Almighty allowed fools to bring their own fates, and Merin had certainly been a fool for climbing on the back of such a dreadful beast.\n\nFinally\u2014blessedly\u2014the horse lurched to a stop. Merin carefully raised his head, hands still gripping the saddle. Lords Aredor and Renarin had stopped their horses, and his own animal had followed their lead. Merin had been half afraid that the creature would just keep on going into eternity, bearing a long-decayed Merin in its saddle.\n\nLord Aredor swung off his horse, dropping to the stones below. \u201cSee,\u201d he said, looking back with a broad grin. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d\n\nMerin shivered. \u201cAredor, that was the most horrible experience of my life.\u201d The first few hours, traveling at a moderate speed, had been bad enough. Aredor hadn\u2019t suggested a gallop until they neared their destination. Merin should have known better than to ask what exactly a \u2018gallop\u2019 was.\n\nAredor laughed, handing his reins to an approaching soldier as his brother dismounted as well. \u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nMerin looked woozily down at the ground, not trusting his legs to move just yet. \u201cI think not. Man wasn\u2019t meant to travel that fast, Aredor. It was terrifying.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa,\u201d Aredor said, walking over to offer Merin a hand. \u201cThis from the man who fearlessly attacked a Shardbearer with no weapon but his own hands?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Merin said, carefully sliding out of the saddle. \u201cBut I did that on my own feet.\u201d\n\nAredor chuckled again, moving over to speak with the nearby squad captain. Merin stood unsteadily for a moment. There was a dull ache through the lower part of his body, reminiscent of that first horrible day when he had joined the army and begun his training with the spear. Soreness would set in before too long.\n\nHe sighed, turning back to his horse and untying his Shardblade from the back of the saddle. The roan beast looked back at him, watching with an almost amused expression\u2014as if it received no end of pleasure from torturing those who saw fit to climb on its back.\n\nThough several days had passed, Merin still felt a strange numbness regarding his new position. It just didn\u2019t seem possible that he was a lord. Who was he, Merin of Stonemount, to carry a Shardblade and ride with Lord Dalenar\u2019s heir? Yet whenever Merin slipped and called Aredor \u2018my lord,\u2019 the older man was quick to correct him. In fact, Aredor treated Merin like an equal. Like a friend. True, Aredor had been ordered to help Merin adapt, but the man hardly needed to be as accommodating as he was.\n\nMerin tried to maintain his perspective\u2014as Meridas had said, he wasn\u2019t really a lord, not like the others. However, Aredor\u2019s affable personality was disarming; Merin couldn\u2019t help treating the man like one of the spearmen from his squad. Or at least a very well-dressed and mannered spearman.\n\nMerin sighed, hefting his Shardblade and resting it on his shoulder. That seemed to be the best way to carry the weapons until they were bonded. He turned, studying the landscape. The scenery was familiar\u2014the barren stones and distant cliffs proved that he was still in Prallah. The main bulk of the army had moved on toward Orinjah, the once-capital of Pralir, creeping at the pace of the unwieldy creature it was.\n\nMerin was looking forward to leaving the third peninsula, traveling through the Oathgate back to Alethkar. He\u2019d never seen an Oathgate before, but apparently one could use one to transport instantly back to Ral Eram, the capital of Alethkar. Ground that had taken years of fighting to cross could instead be covered in a few heartbeats. However, Orinjah would have to wait, for the moment. Dalenar had ordered his sons and Merin to return to the scene of the battlefield several days before; Aredor had yet to explain their errand to Merin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so cold here,\u201d Renarin said in a quiet voice.\n\nMerin paused as a young soldier led his horse away. Renarin stood a short distance away, beside a small hill.\n\n\u201cCold?\u201d Merin asked. While the stormlands were generally a bit cooler than Alethkar, it was still midsummer. It was rarely \u2018cold,\u2019 except maybe following a highstorm.\n\nThen, however, Merin noticed the smoke. Ahead of them, just over a slick-topped hill, several dark trails crept toward the sky. Burning stations\u2014the places where those soldiers unfortunate enough to draw corpse duty were gathering and burning the bodies of their fallen comrades. Thousands of men had died on this battlefield\u2014many more Prallans than Aleths, but in death all were treated the same. Their corpses were transformed through fire, their souls sent to the Almighty, continuing the cycle of Remaking.\n\nRenarin stared quietly up at the columns of smoke. He was so different from his brother. Short with dark, curly hair, Renarin was as unpretentious as Aredor was outgoing. Yet both had a strange way of drawing one\u2019s attention. Aredor did it with sheer force of personality, Renarin with his unnerving, somber eyes. Apparently Merin and Renarin were the same age, but Merin always felt like a child before those eyes.\n\nMerin shivered slightly, reaching for his glyphward\u2014then realizing he didn\u2019t have it on. Aredor had given him some nobleman\u2019s clothing to wear beneath Dalenar\u2019s cloak. The seasilk was unusually soft on his skin, not to mention amazingly tough. It wasn\u2019t as lavish as his cloak, but it was noble, and he had decided not to wear the crom-stained glyphward his mother had given him the day he left for the war. Now, he wished he hadn\u2019t been so prideful. He stood uncomfortably beside Renarin, glad when Aredor finished his conversation and approached.\n\nAredor paused beside the two of them, growing subdued as he regarded the trails of smoke. \u201cCome on,\u201d he said, nodding to the horses.\n\nMerin groaned. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a short distance this time,\u201d Aredor promised. \u201cThe second battlefield isn\u2019t far away.\u201d\n\nSo this is it, Merin thought, looking across the simple field of rock. This is the place where Renarin lost his Shardblade. Like everyone else in the army, Merin had heard the stories of the strange midhighstorm battle. Five thousand Aleth troops and three Shardbearers had faced down and defeated a troop of twenty thousand, killing the Traitor and the Pralir king in the process.\n\nMerin looked down at his Shardblade. It seemed unfair to him that Renarin should bear the king\u2019s anger, losing his Blade on the same day Merin had gained one. Merin\u2019s weapon still showed the markings of its previous owner, though they were hidden by the impromptu \u2018sheath\u2019 Aredor had given him. The sheath was little more than a folded piece of metal, shaped so that it could be placed over the sharp edge of the Blade and tied tight at the back. The sheath was another remnant from Epoch Kingdom days\u2014it had been fashioned from the same metal as Shardplate, to be used by men during their hundred-days bonding period.\n\nSet in the pommel, held by four clasps, was a medium-sized opal. Merin eyed the stone carefully, looking for some sort of change in its color. He could find none\u2014it still glistened with the same multi-colored sheen as before.\n\nAredor chuckled, clasping him on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a couple of days, Merin,\u201d he said. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to notice anything yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long?\u201d Merin asked.\n\nAredor shrugged. \u201cYou should begin to see a change in ten days or so. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s working. When the stone has turned completely black, one hundred days will have passed, and you\u2019ll have bonded the Blade.\u201d\n\nMerin nodded. Ahead, Renarin was already walking down the trail to the battlefield. Merin grimaced slightly as the wind changed, bringing with it the stink of death. While the main battlefield was mostly clean of bodies, this one had barely been touched. A small squad of men worked at a burning station short distance away, but most of the corpses still lay where they had fallen.\n\n\u201cAredor,\u201d he asked, frowning. \u201cWhat winds brought us here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were a spearman, right?\u201d Aredor asked, handing Merin a seasilk handkerchief that smelt strongly of perfume.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Merin replied, thankfully holding the cloth to his face as they followed Renarin toward the battlefield.\n\n\u201cFather wants you to look at the uniforms and armor of the dead men,\u201d Aredor explained, voice slightly muffled by his cloth. \u201cLook for anything . . . odd.\u201d\n\n\u201cOdd how?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Aredor confessed. \u201cAnything irregular or out of place\u2014discrepancies that make you think the men might not actually be from our army.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Merin asked, frowning.\n\nAredor paused, eyeing the battlefield distrustfully, then turning toward Merin. \u201cSomething very strange happened here, Merin. You were a footman. How would you feel, facing a force four times your size? How likely would you have been to win?\u201d\n\nMerin shivered. Four to one? Two to one was practically an assured loss. \u201cThe king says that the Almighty gave them victory,\u201d Merin replied.\n\n\u201cThe king says a lot of things,\u201d Aredor replied. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe my father\u2019s suspicions\u2014he claims that one Aleth soldier is easily worth four Prallans. In a way, he\u2019s right. Our men have far better training, superior equipment, and strong morale . . . but even still, four to one?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what other explanation is there? The Prallans wouldn\u2019t have killed themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but someone else might have done it,\u201d Aredor explained. \u201cFather thinks there was a third force in this battle. One of the arguments against a third army is the fact that they left no bodies behind. Or at least that\u2019s what it seemed like originally.\u201d\n\n\u201cLord Dalenar thinks they were disguised?\u201d Merin asked.\n\n\u201cIt would answer a lot of questions,\u201d Aredor said. \u201cThe third force could have approached the battlefield wearing Prallan uniforms. Once they attacked, their dead would have been indistinguishable from those they killed.\u201d\n\nMerin nodded, turning toward the battlefield again. Several Aleth soldiers approached, bowing and giving them rods to use for examining the bodies. Even still, it was grisly work. Merin, however, had been assigned to corpse detail before. After a while, he was able to ignore the faces and focus on the uniforms.\n\nHe picked across the field, Aredor doing likewise. Merin tried to look for anything unusual or suspicious. It was difficult work. Footmen were given weapons and armor at the beginning of their training, and cared for their own equipment\u2014oiling and polishing after highstorms, fitting and padding to improve flexibility and reduce discomfort. It was difficult to distinguish what might be odd, and what was simply personalized.\n\nThe Aleth soldiers wore leather skirts and vests covered by wooden plates running down the chest. It was relatively cheap, but still effective\u2014the leather and wood could be created easily through Awakening, and required no further smithing. The Prallans wore similar materials, though it was more piecemeal and of a far lesser quality. Merin didn\u2019t know the enemy uniforms well enough to determine if they were odd or not. All of them seemed similar enough.\n\nMerin picked his way across the field. Most of the men appeared to have died from crushing blows. He knew to recognize spear wounds, and most of these wounds weren\u2019t caused by spears. The corpses were bloodied and mangled, but they weren\u2019t cut. Other than that, he had difficulty discerning anything strange.\n\nEventually, Aredor approached him, waving his hand. They retreated to the peripheral of the battle. \u201cAnything?\u201d he asked.\n\nMerin shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Aredor. I keep seeing things that might be odd, but then again they might just be individual peculiarities.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Aredor said. \u201cI did a quick count, and there appear to be about five thousand Aleths\u2014which is the number Renarin sent. If the third force imitated our men, they didn\u2019t leave enough dead behind to make it noticeable.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if they imitated the Prallans?\u201d\n\nAredor sighed. \u201cI looked. I can\u2019t see anything\u2014I don\u2019t think even the Prallans could. They were forced to stretch for resources during the last part of the war. A lot of their soldiers had makeshift armor, or none at all. You can\u2019t find inconsistencies where there\u2019s no regularity.\u201d\n\nMerin nodded.\n\n\u201cWe could count the enemy numbers,\u201d Aredor continued, musing to himself, \u201cbut we never did have a very accurate count in the first place. Of course, it would make sense for a third force imitate the Prallans, since they\u2019re less uniform.\u201d\n\nMerin nodded, looking across the field again. He and Aredor stood near the western edge, beside a rift in the ground. At first, Merin thought it might have hid some secret, but the chasm was obviously empty. Its empty bottom was smooth and well-lit in the afternoon sun\u2014no caves or other secrets hid in its sides.\n\n\u201cThere is one thing,\u201d Merin said.\n\nAredor raised an eyebrow.\n\n\u201cThese men weren\u2019t killed by spearmen.\u201d\n\nAredor nodded. \u201cFather noticed that too. The third force must have been very well-equipped with heavy infantry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Merin said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s more than that. There should have been fields of sliced-up bodies where the Shardbearers fought.\u201d\n\nAredor paused. \u201cBy the Truthmaker!\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t see any bodies killed by Shardbearers\u2014yet we know there were at least five on the battlefield. Our three, the Traitor, and the Pralir king. The Prallans probably had a couple more too.\u201d\n\nAredor stood with a dissatisfied posture, regarding the battlefield again. As he thought, Renarin approached. Dalenar\u2019s second son paused a short distance from Merin and Aredor, however, choosing to turn and stand apart from them as he began his own contemplations.\n\nDalenar\u2019s second son had looked through the battlefield as well, but his movements had been more erratic. He hadn\u2019t examined bodies like Merin, or made counts like Aredor. Eventually, Renarin whispered something to himself.\n\nAredor turned. \u201cWhat was that, Renarin?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said that this is my fault,\u201d the younger son repeated. \u201cI sent these men to their doom. The king was right to take my Blade away.\u201d\n\nAredor walked over, placing a comforting hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong, Renarin. The king would probably have done exactly what you did.\u201d\n\nRenarin shook his head, falling silent.\n\nMerin joined them, studying the battlefield with a careful eye. He was no military expert, but he had spent several years fighting, and had seen large battles before. \u201cI don\u2019t know much, Aredor,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I think your father might be right about the third army.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but the king will want evidence,\u201d Aredor said, stepping up beside Merin. Behind them, Renarin sighed and sat down on the ground, staring down at the rocks in front of him. \u201cElhokar can be winds-cursed stubborn, and he doesn\u2019t want to bother with the possibility of a third army.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we have to find a way to prove that some of these corpses in Prallan uniforms weren\u2019t part of the Traitor\u2019s army,\u201d Merin said. \u201cThat has to be the answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Renarin whispered from behind.\n\nMerin turned, then shivered. Renarin was doing it again, looking at him with those eyes of his. Staring, yet unfocused.\n\n\u201cThese corpses were all either men from our army, or men from the Traitor\u2019s force,\u201d Renarin said.\n\nAredor frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re saying there wasn\u2019t a third army?\u201d\n\nRenarin shook his head. \u201cThere was. It just didn\u2019t leave any bodies behind. They must have taken their corpses with them.\u201d\n\nMerin frowned, looking back at the battlefield. That seemed like an awful lot of trouble to go through\u2014not to mention the time factor. The highstorm had been only a couple of hours long. It would have been near impossible to kill twenty-five thousand men in that time, let alone pick out the corpses of the fallen and transport them somewhere.\n\nMerin turned skeptical eyes toward Aredor. The elder brother, however, was regarding Renarin with interested eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure, Renarin?\u201d Aredor asked.\n\nRenarin nodded, looking a bit sick. \u201cI can see it in the patterns of their bodies. There were dead here that are gone now.\u201d He waved distractedly toward a section of the battlefield. \u201cThe two sides had begun to disengage, in preparation for the highstorm. Then someone else came\u2014over there, on the southern side. After that, our men and the Traitor\u2019s army fought together. They\u2019re all dead now, though. Every one.\u201d\n\nAredor stood for a moment, contemplative. Renarin volunteered no more.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back,\u201d Aredor finally said.\n\nAs little as Merin wanted to admit it, the trip back to the army was nowhere near as arduous as the previous ride had been. Perhaps the growing soreness and fatigue in Merin\u2019s body distracted him from the unnatural motions, or perhaps the \u2018gallop\u2019 before had shown him that regular horse speeds were comparably sane.\n\nAs the hours passed, his grip relaxed, his mind too tired to bother being terrified. Evening was approaching by the time they reached the location of the army\u2019s morning campsite. It was, of course, now empty\u2014the army had moved on, leaving behind remnants of cloth, trash, fire scars, and cesspits.\n\nThe three continued riding. Aredor was confident that they could reach the army by nightfall\u2014Orinjah was supposed to be less than a day\u2019s march from the campsite. Indeed, as they moved on, Merin began to notice a gradual shift in the landscape. They had already begun to leave the stormlands behind, and as they moved further to the southeast, the scenery became eerily familiar.\n\nThe barren rock of the highlands changed to the more sheltered hillsides of common farmlands. The rocky hills lay in belts of land sheltered by the higher grounds nearby, which weakened highstorms. The lower the elevation, the more prevalent rockbuds became, until the stonelike polyps could be seen growing here and there on nearly every surface. Roshtrees hung from overhangs\u2014they appeared as wide tubes of stone at the moment, but after highstorms they would let down vines covered with foliage, and sometimes fruit. A few of the more sheltered ones even had their vines down in the evening coolness.\n\nThe most telling sign of the farmland, however, was the hills that had been cleared of rockbuds and other plant life. Though barren at the moment, they bore ringlike scars made by inavah polyps, which had clung to the hillsides before the summer harvest. They were so similar to the fields of Stonemount that they could have been in Alethkar, if it hadn\u2019t been for the ragged highlands behind them and the absence of the Mount of Ancestors in the distance.\n\nThe road itself was clean of polyps, and beyond that it was easy to see where the army had traveled. Rockbuds were resilient, but their shells were far more brittle than regular stone. A large swath of them lay shattered\u2014shells broken, delicate stalks inside smashed flat\u2014by tromping soldiers bearing metal-heeled boots. The remnants had already dried in the arid summer air.\n\nAredor\u2019s promise that they would reach the army by nightfall proved a bit premature. About an hour after sunset, they finally crested a hill to find hundreds of lights burning across the landscape before them, marking the rise and fall of the land.\n\n\u201cThere,\u201d Aredor said, pointing to the side. In the waning light, Merin could barely make out a steep drop-off in the land. The Prenan Lait, the valley that sheltered the city of Orinjah.\n\nAredor nodded in satisfaction, reining in his horse. \u201cI told you it was within a day\u2019s travel. The king should have already negotiated the city\u2019s surrender. We won\u2019t be able to make it home this evening\u2014the soldiers back home only open the Oathgate to check for us at dawn. Tomorrow, however, we\u2019ll sleep in our own beds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Oathgate,\u201d Merin said with wonder. \u201cWhat does it feel like? Traveling through one?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve never done it before?\u201d Aredor asked with surprise.\n\nMerin shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve never even seen the capital. I come from a Tenth City?\u201d\n\nAredor smirked. \u201cRight. Don\u2019t worry\u2014there\u2019s nothing frightening about the Oathgates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you said about horses,\u201d Merin noted.\n\n\u201cThe Oathgates are even more harmless than horses,\u201d Aredor promised. \u201cThey\u2019re really nothing more than doorways\u2014you can barely tell that there\u2019s anything unusual about them, except the fact that they open up on the other side of Roshar.\u201d\n\nMerin nodded as their horses began to move again. He wasn\u2019t convinced, but if the other option was riding a horse for several weeks back around the sea of Chomar and down the second peninsula to Ral Eram, he was willing to give the Oathgate a try. Besides, he couldn\u2019t suppress his curiosity. He would finally have an image to place with the gateways he had heard of in stories and ballads. The Oathgates were said to have given to man by the Heralds themselves. The ten portals connected the ten capitals of the legendary Epoch Kingdoms back to Ral Eram, the First City, a grand neutral city open to all. The Epoch Kingdoms were long since fallen, and Alethkar controlled Ral Eram now, but it would still be exciting to travel through the gate.\n\nThey rode into camp, Aredor nodding friendly acknowledgments to many of those they passed. Dalenar\u2019s heir was greeted well by all, even those who knew him only by reputation. Merin smiled at the warmth of the reception. Somehow, Aredor managed to remain friendly with even those who should have been his political enemies.\n\nRenarin followed behind them, looking distracted as he rode. Merin eyed him for a moment, then turned to Aredor. \u201cAre we going to report to your father right now?\u201d\n\nAredor shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we going to report . . . everything? Even the things your brother thinks?\u201d\n\nAredor glanced at Merin, then followed his look back toward Renarin. Finally he turned forward again. \u201cI know my brother seems odd, Merin, but he\u2019s really not. He\u2019s just . . . not comfortable with those he doesn\u2019t know. Once you get to know him, you\u2019ll realize he\u2019s not strange at all, just a bit of a daydreamer.\u201d\n\nAredor paused. \u201cBesides,\u201d he continued. \u201cLive with him for a decade or two, and you\u2019ll find that he has an uncanny ability to . . . well, know things. I\u2019ve rarely known him to be wrong. He notices things, Merin. Things regular people just don\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nMerin frowned, reaching reflexively for his glyphward, then again cursing his decision not to wear it. The three of them dismounted at the perimeter of the noble tents, and then made their way toward Dalenar\u2019s pavilion. Outside, Merin saw several unfamiliar guards. One, a shorter man, bald and lithe with a short beard, eyed them with a careful look as they entered the tent.\n\nInside, Lord Dalenar sat in discussion with a woman Merin had seen only at a distance. Lady Jasnah Kholin was striking with her immaculate hair, fine features, and poised attitude. She sat in one of Dalenar\u2019s chairs, wearing a green noblewoman\u2019s dress, well illuminated by the room\u2019s four lanterns. Behind her stood a young woman with red hair and a roundish face.\n\n\u201cNo, he didn\u2019t tell me either,\u201d Dalenar was saying. He waved Merin and his sons forward, not pausing in his dialogue. \u201cBut whatever it is, Elhokar believed it. Part of me is eager to see Balenmar in favor at court again\u2014the man served Nolhonarin right up to the day of his death, even taking a wound in defense of his king despite his age.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like secrets, Uncle,\u201d Lady Jasnah said. \u201cEven if they are kept by allies.\u201d She paused, eyeing Merin with a critical look.\n\n\u201cThe boy is trustworthy, Jasnah,\u201d Dalenar said. \u201cHe\u2019s a ward in my house now.\u201d\n\nJasnah didn\u2019t seem as convinced as Dalenar, and Merin glanced down, feeling self-conscious before her eyes.\n\n\u201cRegardless,\u201d Dalenar said. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our suspicions secret from them\u2014we did, after all, send them to spy for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should hardly call it spying, Father,\u201d Aredor said lightly, stepping forward and pouring himself something to drink from the winetable at the side of the tent. \u201cAfter all, the dead can hardly offer complaint.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you discover?\u201d Jasnah asked, her tone cool and businesslike.\n\n\u201cVery little,\u201d Aredor said. Renarin stayed near the front of the tent, and Merin\u2014uncertain of his place, did likewise. \u201cThere was definitely a third army,\u201d Aredor continued.\n\n\u201cYou have proof?\u201d Lady Jasnah asked.\n\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d Aredor said, sighing and taking a seat beside his father. \u201cBut the third army is the only reasonable explanation. The way the soldiers were standing when they died . . . the strange manner of the wounds . . . it all points toward a third force.\u201d\n\nLord Dalenar frowned deeply. \u201cThe idea of a vanishing army that can destroy twenty thousand troops makes me very uncomfortable, Jasnah.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Lady Jasnah said in her calm, almost emotionless voice. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m having enough trouble keeping my brother from riding of to try and conquer the rest of the world\u2014it won\u2019t be easy to persuade him to listen to our worries.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that I care whether or not he listens,\u201d Dalenar replied. \u201cI\u2019m just worried that this attack will lead to something else. Another strike of some sort.\u201d\n\nJasnah nodded and the tent fell silent, the only sound that of Aredor sipping his wine. Eventually, Jasnah spoke. \u201cWe have another problem as well, Uncle. Balenmar\u2019s words regarding the Queen Nanavah appear to be true\u2014I\u2019ve been interviewing the messengers who have visited Ral Eram recently. I may have a battle on my hands when I return.\u201d\n\nDalenar shook his head. \u201cNow is not the time for the queen to begin growing into her station. I thought perhaps once the war was over, things would get easier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey never do,\u201d Jasnah said. \u201cNo good can come from leaving the court to itself for two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish Elhokar would . . .\u201d Dalenar tapered off, sighing. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Jasnah. I don\u2019t have the patience to deal with your brother anymore. It takes all of my effort to remain civil when I talk to the boy.\u201d\n\nLady Jasnah sat for a moment, looking thoughtful. Her eyes were composed, her demeanor withdrawn. Looking into that face, Merin could believe the stories he\u2019d often heard told about her. She seemed to lack anything in the way of emotion\u2014save, perhaps, for displeasure.\n\n\u201cShall we divide our efforts, then, Uncle?,\u201d Lady Jasnah asked. \u201cI will see to my brother and the queen, and will try and find out just what Balenmar said to gain himself the king\u2019s graces again. See what you can discover about our vanishing army, and send word to me if you discover anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Dalenar said.\n\n\u201cGood evening, then. I have preparations to make for the morrow\u2019s return.\u201d\n\nLady Jasnah rose, and Dalenar stood courteously as she turned to go. She paused briefly beside Renarin as she reached the tent\u2019s exit. \u201cRenarin,\u201d she said, \u201chow are you managing?\u201d The words were sincere, even if her tone remained neutral\u2014perhaps there was more warmth beneath that face than was first apparent.\n\nRenarin smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine, my lady. Please, don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will get you another Shardblade,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Renarin said. \u201cI never really needed one anyway.\u201d\n\nLady Jasnah paused, then nodded to him, and swept from the room, female attendant following behind.\n\nLord Dalenar waved the boys forward, seating himself and nodding for them to do likewise. \u201cNow,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me exactly what you saw and thought when you searched the battlefield.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/w-s-merwin", "page_content": "William Stanley (W.S.) Merwin was born in New York City in 1927 and raised in New Jersey and Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of a Presbyterian minister. His numerous collections of poetry, his translations, and his books of prose have won praise over seven decades. Though his early poetry received great attention and admiration, Merwin would continue to alter and innovate his craft with each new book, and at each stage he served as a powerful influence for poets of his generation and younger poets. For the entirety of his writing career, he explored a sense of wonder and celebrated the power of language, while serving as a staunch anti-war activist and advocate for the environment. He won nearly every award available to an American poet, and he was named U.S. poet laureate twice. A practicing Buddhist as well as a proponent of deep ecology, Merwin lived since the late 1970s on an old pineapple plantation in Hawaii which he has painstakingly restored to its original rainforest state. Poet Edward Hirsch wrote that Merwin \u201cis one of the greatest poets of our age. He is a rare spiritual presence in American life and letters (the Thoreau of our era).\u201d\n\n\n\nHis first collection of poetry, A Mask for Janus (1952), was chosen by W.H. Auden for the Yale Younger Poets Prize. While that first book reflected the formalism of the period, Merwin eventually became known for an impersonal, indirect, and open style that eschewed punctuation. Writing in the Guardian, Jay Parini described Merwin\u2019s mature style as \u201chis own kind of free verse, [where] he layered image upon bright image, allowing the lines to hang in space, largely without punctuation, without rhymes ... with a kind of graceful urgency.\u201d Although Merwin\u2019s writing has undergone stylistic changes through the course of his career, a recurring theme is man\u2019s separation from nature. The poet saw the consequences of that alienation as disastrous, both for the human race and for the rest of the world.\n\nRegarding his own development as a writer, Merwin once said, \u201cI started writing hymns for my father almost as soon as I could write at all, illustrating them... But the first real writers that held me were not poets: Conrad first, and then Tolstoy, and it was not until I had received a scholarship and gone away to the university that I began to read poetry steadily and try incessantly, and with abiding desperation, to write it.\u201d Merwin attended Princeton University and studied with R.P. Blackmur and John Berryman. After graduating in 1948, he continued as a post-graduate student of Romance languages and eventually traveled through much of Europe, translating poetry and working as a tutor, including for the son of poet Robert Graves. Merwin\u2019s early collections\u2014especially A Mask for Janus\u2014reflect the influence of Graves and the medieval poetry Merwin was translating at the time.\n\nIndeed, the poetic forms of many eras and societies are the foundation for a great deal of Merwin\u2019s poetry. His first books contain many pieces inspired by diverse, classical models. According to Vernon Young in the American Poetry Review, the poems are traceable to \u201cBiblical tales, Classical myth, love songs from the Age of Chivalry, Renaissance retellings; they comprise carols, roundels, odes, ballads, sestinas, and they contrive golden equivalents of emblematic models: the masque, the Zodiac, the Dance of Death.\u201d In 1956, Merwin was offered a fellowship from the Poets\u2019 Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts and returned to the U.S. His books from this period, Green with Beasts (1956) and The Drunk in the Furnace (1960), show the beginning of a shift in style and tone as Merwin began to experiment with irregular forms. The Drunk in the Furnace, which was written during Merwin\u2019s tenure in Boston when he was meeting poets such as Robert Lowell, particularly shows his new engagement with American themes. His obsession with the meaning of America and its values can make Merwin sometimes seem like the great nineteenth-century poet Walt Whitman, critic Ed Folsom noted in Shenandoah: \u201cHis poetry ... often implicitly and sometimes explicitly responds to Whitman; his twentieth-century sparsity and soberness\u2014his doubts about the value of America\u2014answer, temper, Whitman\u2019s nineteenth-century expansiveness and exuberance\u2014his enthusiasm over the American creation.\u201d\n\nMerwin\u2019s next books were some of his most critically acclaimed and continue to be influential volumes. The Lice (1967), often read as a response to the Vietnam War, also condemns modern man in apocalyptic and visionary terms. \u201cThese are poems not written to an agenda but that create an agenda,\u201d wrote poet and critic Reginald Shepherd, \u201cpreserving and recreating the world in passionate words. Merwin has always been concerned with the relationship between morality and aesthetics, weighing both terms equally. His poems speak back to the fallen world not as tracts but as artistic events.\u201d Dozens of poets pointed to The Lice as a major influence on their own writing, and the book remains one of Merwin\u2019s most-read volumes of poetry. His next book, The Carrier of Ladders (1970) won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1971. He famously donated the prize money to the draft resistance movement, writing an essay for the New York Review of Books that outlined his objections to the Vietnam War. His article spiked the ire of W.H. Auden, who wrote a response arguing that the award was apolitical. The Carrier of Ladders shows Merwin continuing to engage with American themes and nature, and includes a long sequence on American westward expansion. That same year, Merwin published The Miner\u2019s Pale Children: A Book of Prose. Reviewing both volumes for the New York Times, Helen Vendler noted that \u201cthese books invoke by their subtitles the false distinction between prose and poetry: the real distinction is between prose and verse, since both are books of poems, with distinct resemblances and a few differences.\u201d\n\nMerwin moved to Hawaii to study Zen Buddhism in 1976. He eventually settled in Maui and began to restore the forest surrounding his former plantation. Both the rigor of practicing Buddhism and the tropical landscape greatly influenced Merwin\u2019s later style. His next books increasingly show his preoccupation with the natural world. The Compass Flower (1977), Opening the Hand (1983), and The Rain in the Trees (1988) \u201care concerned not only with what to renounce in the metropolis but also what to preserve in the country,\u201d noted Ed Hirsch in the New York Times. Many of the poems in the last volume \u201cimmerse themselves in nature with a fresh sense of numinousness,\u201d said Hirsch, while also mourning the loss of that nature to human greed and destruction. Merwin has continued to produce striking poems using nature as a backdrop. The Vixen (1996), for instance, is an exploration of the rural forest in southwestern France that Merwin called home for many years. Poet-critic J. D. McClatchy remarked in the New Yorker that \u201cthe book is suffused with details of country life\u2014solitary walks and garden work, woodsmoke, birdsong, lightfall.\u201d But Merwin\u2019s later poetry doesn\u2019t merely describe the natural world; it also records and condemns the destruction of nature, from the felling of sacred forests to the extinction of whole species. Migration: New and Selected Poems (2005) exposes Merwin\u2019s evolution as a stylist over half a century but also shows, as Ben Lerner noted in his review of the volume for Jacket, that \u201cMerwin ... is an unwaveringly political poet ... [he] not only tracks the literal impoverishment of our planet, but he makes it symbolize the impoverishment of our culture\u2019s capacity for symbolization.\u201d Migration was awarded the National Book Award for poetry.\n\nSome literary critics have identified Merwin with the group known as the oracular poets, but Merwin himself once commented: \u201cI have not evolved an abstract aesthetic theory and am not aware of belonging to any particular group of writers.\u201d Reviewing Migration for the New York Times, Dan Chiasson described Merwin poems as \u201csecular prophecy grounded on perceptual fineness.\u201d But while Merwin\u2019s work from the 1960s and early \u201870s perhaps best embody this mode, Chiasson believed that \u201cits signature open form has been preserved whatever the occasion. What began as stylistic necessity has become a mannerism.\u201d Merwin has continued to win high praise for his poetry, however, including the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for his collection The Shadow of Sirius (2008). The book\u2019s three sections deal with childhood and memory, death and wisdom, and are some of the most autobiographical of his career. The Pulitzer Prize committee cited the book for its \u201cluminous, often-tender poems that focus on the profound power of memory.\u201d Merwin continues to add to his impressive body of work with recent collections such as Garden Time (2016) and The Moon Before Morning (2014). Reviewing The Essential W.S. Merwin (2017) in the New Yorker, Dan Chiasson remarked, \u201cMerwin\u2019s insistence on a poetry of imaginative utility, against the encroachments of decades of literary fads, has succeeded in giving his imagined worlds some of the tangible pleasures and horrors we associate with real ones. Like Stevens, whose old-age poems are perhaps the greatest ever written, Merwin can say he \u2018recomposed\u2019 the constituents of his vision. But he also planted and tended a palm forest that is now permanently protected and open to the public. His poems, like that forest, are a kind of time preserve.\u201d\n\nIn addition to writing poetry, prose and drama, Merwin is an accomplished and prolific translator of poetry. Merwin has also translated poets as diverse as Osip Mandelstam and Pablo Neruda. His translation of Dante\u2019s Purgatorio (2000) and the Middle English epic Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (2004) both won high praise for their graceful, accessible language, and his Selected Translations (2013) won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award. With Takako Lento he translated the Collected Haiku of Yosa Buson (2013).\n\nMerwin won most awards available to American poets, including the Bollingen Prize, two Pulitzer Prizes, the Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry, a Ford Foundation grant, the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the PEN Translation Prize, the Shelley Memorial Award, the Wallace Stevens Award, the Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award, a Lila Wallace-Reader\u2019s Digest Writers\u2019 Award, and the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award. He has also been awarded fellowships from The Academy of American Poets, the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Rockefeller Foundation. Merwin is a former chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and two-time U.S. poet laureate (1999-2000, 2010-2011).\n\nMerwin was once asked what social role a poet plays\u2014if any\u2014in America. He commented: \u201cI think there\u2019s a kind of desperate hope built into poetry now that one really wants, hopelessly, to save the world. One is trying to say everything that can be said for the things that one loves while there\u2019s still time. I think that\u2019s a social role, don\u2019t you? ... We keep expressing our anger and our love, and we hope, hopelessly perhaps, that it will have some effect. But I certainly have moved beyond the despair, or the searing, dumb vision that I felt after writing The Lice; one can\u2019t live only in despair and anger without eventually destroying the thing one is angry in defense of. The world is still here, and there are aspects of human life that are not purely destructive, and there is a need to pay attention to the things around us while they are still around us. And you know, in a way, if you don\u2019t pay that attention, the anger is just bitterness.\u201d\n\n\n\nMerwin died in March 2019 at the age of 91."}, {"url": "https://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org/reference/characterofthemonth/huan.php", "page_content": "Huan the Hound of Valinor\n\nHuan is one of the most if not the most truly noble beasts in The Silmarillion and a hero by the standards of almost any reader. He is described in the Index of Names to The Silmarillion as:\n\nThe great wolfhound of Valinor that Orom\u00eb gave to Celegorm; friend and helper of Beren and L\u00fathien; slew and slain by Carcharoth. The name means 'great dog, hound'. (1)\n\nIf there are readers who ever wondered what noble Huan was like as a puppy, the good news is that Tolkien actually tells us in The Lay of Leithian.\n\nIn Tavros\u2019 (2) friths and pastures green\n\nHad Huan once a young welp been.\n\nHe grew the swiftest of the swift,\n\nAnd Orom\u00eb gave him as a gift\n\nTo Celegorm, who loved to follow\n\nThe great God\u2019s horn o\u2019er hill and hollow. (3)\n\nThe story of Huan, like so many recounted in the history of the First Age, begins in the idyllic land of Valinor in Aman only to end in sorrow in Middle-earth. But part of the appreciation of Tolkien\u2019s tales of those elder days involves the emotionally compelling contrast of the final fate fraught with drama of a character against a more tranquil origin. In this case, one is invited to consider the half-grown dog, bounding, carefree with his tongue hanging out, after a guiltless and young Celegorm the Fair under the light of Laurelin. That part of Huan\u2019s tale is, however, tragically short.\n\nHis story begins with Huan portrayed as loyal to his master in the way of all good beasts. When Celegorm follows his father from Aman to Middle-earth, against the warning of the Valar, Huan goes along with him.\n\nNow the chief of the wolf hounds that followed Celegorm was named Huan. He was not born in Middle-earth, but came from the Blessed Realm; for Orom\u00eb had given him to Celegorm long ago in Valinor, and there he had followed the horn of his master, before evil came. Huan followed Celegorm into exile, and was faithful; and thus he too came under the doom of woe set upon the Noldor, and it was decreed that he should meet death, but not until he encountered the mightiest wolf that would ever walk the world. (4)\n\nOne must conclude from the above paragraph that Huan, for all of his loyalty and heroism, is not considered perfect and whole by the Valar. Huan sadly is as bound by the Curse of Mandos as is the Noldorin prince who is his master because the faithful hound chooses to leave Aman and follow Celegorm into exile.\n\nHuan is described as being as big as a small horse. His connection to the Vala Orom\u00eb and to Celegorm, both notable in the legendarium as great hunters, leads one to presume that Huan is adept as a hunter as well. No exact descriptions are given of his appearance in the text, except for the reference to his outstanding size and his grey coat. One may also make certain assumptions based upon his capacity to match himself in battle against the great wolves of Angband and Sauron in wolf form. Many readers, this one among them, are quick to imagine him being similar to the great Irish Wolfhounds whose origins are lost in myth and whose exploits extend to legends set upon the Isle of Britain as well as Ireland. Those great hounds are often described as growing to nearly the height of a colt and being the tallest of canines. The personality and dedication of Huan is reminiscent of the story of brave Gelert (5) the faithful hound of Wales, who is reputed to have been an Irish Wolfhound also. Irish Wolfhounds are commonly described in a rapture of superlatives. The following is not at all atypical of such descriptions:\n\nNoble in character, majestic in bearing, swift in the chase, tenacious to the end, a mighty hunter, generous to friend but terrible to foe, supreme among the canine races for intelligence and an almost uncanny sense of good and evil, sublime in his devotion, the joy of his master's heart, and faithful unto death--such is the splendid record of the Irish wolfhound, gleaned from the mythological legends of the Emerald Isle and taken from the written page of English history from the dawn of our race unto the twentieth century. (6)\n\nThis creates an image which can be easily applied to Huan. In relation to the nature of Huan, the speculation is often raised that his powers of reasoning and speech, which place him beyond even the most exceptional of dogs, could lead one to believe that he ranks among the semi-divine--that is to say that Huan is more likely than not a Maia. The logic supporting that possibility and an exact reference thereto exist within the texts. In a short, less than definitive series of notes on the nature and creation of the Orcs in the Myths Transformed section of Morgoth\u2019s Ring, one finds the following remarks:\n\nWhat of talking beasts and birds with reasoning and speech? These have been rather lightly adopted from less 'serious' mythologies, but play a part which cannot now be excised. They are certainly 'exceptions' and not much used, but sufficiently to show they are a recognized feature of the world. All other creatures accept them as natural if not common. But true 'rational' creatures, 'speaking peoples', are all of human/'humanoid' form. Only the Valar and Maiar are intelligences that can assume forms of Arda at will. Huan and Sorontar could be Maiar--emissaries of Manw\u00eb. (a href=\"#bio-ref\">7)\n\nOne the principle attributes of Huan is that he is endowed with the ability to understand the tongues of Elves and Men and to speak himself in words, but only three times in his life. In The Tale of Tin\u00faviel, the following elegant words are put into the mouth of Huan at his first sighting of L\u00fathien:\n\nGreat therefore was the good fortune that befell Tin\u00faviel in meeting with Huan in the woods, although at first she was mortally afraid and fled. But Huan overtook her in two leaps, and speaking soft and deep the tongue of the Lost Elves he bid her be not afraid, and, \"Wherefore,\" said he, \"do I see an Elfin maiden, and one most fair, wandering alone so nigh to the abodes of the Ainu of Evil? Knowst thou not these are very evil places to be in, little one, even with a companion, and they are death to the lonely?\" (8)\n\nThe role of Huan remains similar from the earliest drafts of the story of L\u00fathien Tin\u00faviel to the latest, although his history and the small details may vary. For narrative purposes, the version which we will rely upon in this short character biography is the one found in the published Silmarillion. That one relies upon the text of The Quenta Silmarillion and The Lay of Leithian (9). The much earlier version of the story of L\u00fathien and Huan in The Book of Lost Tales includes a complicated abandoned plot involving Tevildo the Prince of Cats, who particularly hates Huan. Most of Tevildo\u2019s role in the story is later given over to Sauron. (Some cat fancier may wish to compare and contrast the feline villain to the character of Sauron in a separate essay. It is much too complex to track every bit of that duplicative and discarded storyline in this presumably short biography of an important but minor character.)\n\nIn all versions of the story of L\u00fathien and Huan, they take to each other immediately. In The Silmarillion, when Huan encounters the fleeing L\u00fathien in the forest, he brings her to meet his master and his master\u2019s brother.\n\nHuan it was that found L\u00fathien flying like a shadow surprised by the daylight under the trees, when Celegorm and Curufin rested a while near to the western eaves of Doriath; for nothing could escape the sight and scent of Huan, nor could any enchantment stay him, and he slept not, neither by night nor day. He brought her to Celegorm, and L\u00fathien, learning that he was a prince of the Noldor and a foe of Morgoth, was glad; and she declared herself, casting aside her cloak. (a href=\"#bio-ref\">10)\n\nWe might presume that it is partially due to her trust in Huan that L\u00fathien reveals herself with such alacrity to Celegorm and Curufin and goes with them to Nargothrond. It is a short time later, when she finds herself to be involuntarily detained by the lovelorn Celegorm and scheming Curufin, that L\u00fathien shares her confidences with Huan and the dog returns her friendship in full.\n\nBut Huan the hound was true of heart, and the love of L\u00fathien had fallen upon him in the first hour of their meeting; and he grieved at her captivity. Therefore he came often to her chamber; and at night he lay before her door, for he felt that evil had come to Nargothrond. L\u00fathien spoke often to Huan in her loneliness, telling of Beren, who was the friend of all birds and beasts that did not serve Morgoth; ad Huan understood all that was said. For he comprehended the speech of all things with voice; but it was permitted to him thrice only ere his death to speak with words. (a href=\"#bio-ref\">11)\n\nHaving heard L\u00fathien\u2019s story in great detail, Huan is finally moved to the point that he chooses to use the first of his three allotted opportunities for speech to reveal a way for her to escape Nargothrond.\n\nThus Huan spoke, who never before\n\nHad uttered words, and but twice more\n\nDid speak in elven tongue again:\n\n\u201cLady beloved, whom all Men,\n\nwhom Elfinesse, and whom all things\n\nwith fur and fell and feathered wings\n\nshould serve and love- arise! Away!\n\nPut on thy cloak! Before the day\n\nComes over Nargothrond we fly\n\nTo Northern perils, thou and I.\u201d\n\nAnd ere he ceased he counsel wrought\n\nFor achievement of the thing he sought.\n\nThere Luthien listened in amaze,\n\nAnd softly on Huan did she gaze.\n\nHer arms about his neck she cast \u2013\n\nIn friendship that to death should last. (12)\n\nThe reader of The Lay of Leithian is convinced at this point that the remarkable hound of Valinor and the Sindarin princess will make a great questing pair. The Silmarillion text continues the narrative of their mission to reunite L\u00fathien with Beren.\n\nThen he led her by secret ways out of Nargothrond, and they fled north together; and he humbled his pride and suffered her to ride upon him in the fashion of a steed, even as the Orcs did at times upon great wolves. Thus they made great speed, for Huan was swift and tireless. (13)\n\nHuan safely accompanies L\u00fathien to Tol-in-Gaurhoth (the Isle of Werewolves). They arrive just a little too late to have any chance of intervening to save Finrod Felagund. There Huan is able to defeat and kill all of Sauron\u2019s werewolves, with the assistance of L\u00fathien's magic.\n\nTherefore he sent a wolf to the bridge. But Huan slew it silently. Still Sauron sent others one by one; and one by one Huan took them by the throat and slew them. Then Sauron sent Draugluin, a dread beast, old in evil lord and sire of the werewolves of Angband. His might was great; and the battle of Huan and Draugluin was long and fierce. Yet at length Draugluin escaped, and fleeing back into the tower he died before Sauron's feet; and as he died he told his master: 'Huan is there!' (14)\n\nSauron himself then takes upon the shape of the greatest wolf that has ever lived up hoping to fulfill the prophecy that Huan will meet his end in battle against such a wolf.\n\nNow Sauron knew well, as did all in that land, the fate that was decreed for the hound of Valinor, and it came into his thought that he himself would accomplish it. Therefore he took upon himself the form of a werewolf, and made himself the mightiest that had yet walked the world; and he came forth to win the passage of the bridge. (a href=\"#bio-ref\">15)\n\nHowever, Huan, with the support of L\u00fathien, is able to defeat Sauron, who abandons the form of a wolf in order to escape. \u201cAnd immediately he took the form of a vampire, great as a dark cloud across the moon, and he fled, dripping blood from his throat upon the trees . . . \u201d (16).\n\nAt the reunification of Beren and L\u00fathien, Beren grieves for the loss of his friend Finrod and Huan leaves the couple to themselves, returning to his master out of a long habit of loyalty, although he is never to love Celegorm as he had before all that had transpired in Nargothrond.\n\nLater, after the F\u00ebanorian brothers have been exiled from Nargothrond by Orodreth when he learned of their schemes, L\u00fathien and Beren once more encounter Celegorm and Curufin. Curufin tries to kill L\u00fathien, but Huan turns against his master, defending Beren and L\u00fathien.\n\nThen for the second time Huan spoke with words; and he counselled Beren, saying: 'From the shadow of death you can no longer save L\u00fathien, for by her love she is now subject to it. You can turn from your fate and lead her into exile, seeking peace in vain while your life lasts. But if you will not deny your doom, then either L\u00fathien, being forsaken, must assuredly die alone, or she must with you challenge the fate that lies before you--hopeless, yet not certain. Further counsel I cannot give, nor may I go further on your road. But my heart forebodes that what you find at the Gate I shall myself see. All else is dark to me; yet it may be that our three paths lead back to Doriath, and we may meet before the end.' (a href=\"#bio-ref\">17)\n\nHuan told Beren and L\u00fathien of a plan he had devised for entering Angband. He is the one who suggested using the pelt of the werewolf Draugluin and the skin of Sauron's messenger bat Thuringwethil. Wearing these skins Beren and L\u00fathien are able to gain access into Angband. Huan does not accompany them, but he is right in his prediction that they will meet again soon. Beren and L\u00fathien manage to regain the Silmaril through their courage and clever trickery, but Beren loses his hand that holds the Silmaril to the monster werewolf Carcharoth.\n\nA terrorizing Carcharoth, crazed with the pain of the Silmaril still clasped in the severed hand of Beren burning within his gut, goes off on a killing spree crossing over the border into Doriath, attacking closer and closer to Menegroth. Beren and L\u00fathien reach Doriath and tell the tale of their adventure and their seizure of the Silmaril and its loss to the same beast which is ravaging the country around Doriath. Determined to protect Doriath, King Elu Thingol, Beren, Mablung, and Beleg C\u00fathalion, with the invaluable assistance of Huan, organize the Great Hunt for the Wolf. Huan pursues and successfully tracks Caracharoth. Beren is gravely injured bringing Carcharoth down while Huan continues to fight the wolf to the death. Huan at last prevails over the massive werewolf but is poisoned in the process and dies.\n\nHuan\u2019s third and last use of his opportunity to speak is expended in bidding good-bye Beren and L\u00fathien before dying.\n\nHuan in that hour slew Carcharoth; but there in the woven woods of Doriath his own doom long spoken was fulfilled, and he was wounded mortally, and the venom of Morgoth entered into him. Then he came, and falling beside Beren spoke for the third time with words; and he bade Beren farewell before he died. Beren spoke not, but laid his hand upon the head of the hound, and so they parted.

The novel was serialized in The Strand Magazine (1901\u201302) and was published in book form in 1902. It was the first Sherlock Holmes tale since the detective\u2019s shocking \u201cdeath\u201d in the story \u201cThe Final Problem\u201d (1893) but was set prior to his demise. The popularity of The Hound of the Baskervilles helped pave the way for Holmes\u2019s appearance in later works.\n\nBased on a local legend of a spectral hound that haunted Dartmoor in Devonshire, England, the story is set in the moors at Baskerville Hall and the nearby Grimpen Mire, and the action takes place mostly at night, when the terrifying hound howls for blood. After Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead with his face twisted in stark terror, Holmes is called upon to protect his heir, Sir Henry Baskerville. Narrating the story is Holmes\u2019s assistant, Dr. Watson, who is sent to Dartmoor while the busy Holmes remains in London. Upon his arrival, Watson learns that an escaped convict is on the loose. More unsettling events occur, including the appearance of an unknown figure on the moor. Watson later discovers that the mysterious person is Holmes, who has been conducting his own investigation. Holmes deduces that the killer is Jack Stapleton, a neighbour who is actually Rodger Baskerville. Hoping to inherit the family estate, he has plotted to kill his relatives using a vicious hound that he has painted with phosphorous to appear sinister. The superstitious Charles suffered a heart attack after being frightened by the animal. Stapleton also hopes to kill Henry Baskerville but is thwarted by Holmes. Afterward Stapleton flees and is believed to have died, swallowed by Grimpen Mire.\n\nBritannica Quiz The Literary World (Famous Novels)\n\nIn The Hound of the Baskervilles Conan Doyle uncharacteristically emphasized the eerie setting and mysterious atmosphere rather than the hero\u2019s deductive ingenuity. One of the all-time classic mysteries, the novel was hugely popular as readers rejoiced at the return of Sherlock Holmes. (His death in \u201cThe Final Problem\u201d had enraged fans, causing thousands to cancel their subscriptions to The Strand.) Although Conan Doyle had previously claimed to have grown \u201cweary\u201d of Sherlock\u2019s name, he subsequently revived the character after negotiating a large payment from publishers. A series of short stories were published in 1903\u201304 and later collected in The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1905). The Hound of the Baskervilles was adapted for film numerous times, beginning with a silent German production in 1914."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mersenne/", "page_content": "First published Fri May 11, 2018; substantive revision Mon Jun 13, 2022\n\nAlthough these features of Mersenne\u2019s activities (as an animator of scientific life and as Descartes\u2019s friend and correspondent) are the most well-known, they should not conceal Mersenne\u2019s own original contribution to philosophy. While his first works were polemic in tone, offering \u201cscientific apologetics\u201d (Lenoble 1943) using arguments taken from the sciences to defend Christian catholic religion against all sorts of heterodox trends threatening it, his latter publications (from 1634 onward), far less concerned with apologetics, illustrated and promoted the new mechanical, mathematical, and experimental sciences. A key thread running through his complex intellectual career, music, understood as the general science of harmonics, received Mersenne\u2019s constant attention and was the subject of several important publications.\n\nThe Minim friar Marin Mersenne (1588\u20131648) played a central role in French intellectual life of the first half of the seventeenth century. At a time when scientific periodicals were still sorely lacking, he was rightly referred to as \u201cThe Secretary of Learned Europe\u201d (\u201cle secr\u00e9taire de l\u2019Europe savante\u201d, Haur\u00e9au 1877, p. 177) thanks to his sprawling correspondence, which extended his network across the whole of learned Europe, to his role as translator, editor, disseminator of scientific information, and to his ability to generate research and discoveries by creating \u201cfine questions\u201d (de belles questions, Pascal 1658, p. 1) addressed to the foremost scholars of the time. His tireless activity certainly helped to create a new image of a mathematical, mechanistic and experimental science in the making, based on the exchange of information and co-operation between European scholars. Part of his fame is also due to his lifelong connection to Descartes. From the time the latter settled in Holland, Mersenne was his main, and at times unique, correspondent, providing him with rich information on intellectual life, and relentlessly questioning him on philosophical and scientific matters.\n\n1. Life and Works\n\nMarin Mersenne was born on 8 September 1588 near Oiz\u00e9 in the French region of Haut-Maine (nowadays the Sarthe). He came from a family of merchants and small landowners. After studying at the college du Mans, he was sent in 1604 to the newly created Jesuit college of La Fl\u00e8che, where he received the established Jesuit education, coupling humanist\u2014Ciceronian\u2014and Aristotelian traditions (Dear 1988). He may have met there the young Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who entered La Fl\u00e8che in 1606, although it is unlikely that their friendship started then, as Descartes was 8 years his junior. When he left the college, Mersenne completed his training in theology, Greek and Hebrew in Paris at the Coll\u00e8ge Royal and at the Sorbonne where he was instructed by the Thomist theologians Fran\u00e7ois Ysambert and Philippe de Gamache (see Coste 1648; Armogathe 1994). Attracted to the strict rule of the Minims, a Franciscan order recently introduced into France, he took the habits in 1611, and after periods of novitiate and teaching in Meaux, Paris and Never, was recalled to Paris in 1619 at the new house on the Place Royale (the present Place des Vosges) where he remained permanently, apart from a few trips to the French provinces, to the Netherlands in 1630, and to Italy from 1644 to 1645.\n\nFrom the years 1620 onward, Mersenne deployed overflowing intellectual activity. Through the mediation of Claude Fabbri de Pereisc whom he had met in 1616, he was introduced to the Parisian intellectual elite, and later to Pierre Gassendi with whom he remained close friends. In Paris, he associated with the mathematician Claude Mydorge, and, perhaps through him, renewed acquaintance with Descartes. Mersenne called on Descartes\u2019s mathematical expertise on questions of optics. His questions led Descartes to his first formulation of the law of refraction, which he was to publish later in his 1637 \u201cDioptrics\u201d. Mersenne was among those attending the famous meeting of 1628, at the residence of the apostolic nuncio, where Descartes, having revealed his project of founding the sciences on a new method, had been encouraged to do so by the highest religious authorities. After Descartes left for Holland, Mersenne remained in close contact with him through correspondence. He was privy to most of Descartes\u2019s secret addresses, which made him the man one has to see in order to get access to the French exile, to send him letters or questions. Only four letters from Mersenne to Descartes are extant, but 146 letters from Descartes\u2014about a quarter of his known correspondence\u2014testify to the intensity and continuity of the exchange. Mersenne endlessly provided Descartes with books, fresh information, and editorial services, requesting in exchange answers to queries of all sorts. Acting as mediator in Descartes\u2019s controversies, with Fermat, Roberval, Beaugrand, Morin, or Vo\u00ebtius, he sometimes caused quarrels himself, through his indiscretions, such as the one which made Descartes definitively fall out with his erstwhile mentor Isaac Beeckman. Mersenne also acted as intermediary for the edition of the Meditationes de prima philosophiae, and was instrumental in the gathering of the six sets of objections that were added to the text with Descartes\u2019s responses, including those of Hobbes and Gassendi. He contributed himself to the objectiones, penning the second set (\u201cgathered by the R. P. Mersenne from the mouth of various theologians and philosophers\u201d, AT IX-1: 96; Buccolini 2019) and perhaps parts of the sixth.\n\nMersenne\u2019s dealings with Descartes were only a small part of the network of intellectual communication that he built up throughout his career. He was largely responsible for introducing Galileo into France, offering in 1630\u2014without receiving an answer\u2014to publish his future work on the Two Chief Systems of the World. In 1634, he published Les M\u00e9chaniques de Galil\u00e9e, a free translation of a manuscript on mechanics by the Florentine scholar, completed with ideas borrowed from Guidobaldo and Stevin, and with original comments of his own, and, in 1639, the Nouvelles pens\u00e9es de Galil\u00e9e, a translation or adaptation of certain parts of the Discorsi a due nuove scienze, published in Italy one year earlier. Mersenne was also in regular contact with English scholars. He translated into French the De Veritate of Herbert of Cherbury (although the book had been placed in the Index, i.e., the list of prohibited books published by the Catholic Church); in good terms with Hobbes (Baldin 2020), he published one of his optical treatises, and Sorbi\u00e8re\u2019s French translation of the De Cive. He corresponded with Kenelm Digby and Lord Cavendish and others.\n\nIn Paris, a small scientific circle of mathematicians and physicists gradually formed around Mersenne. From 1633 or so, meetings were organized on Thursdays at the houses of one or another of his friends or protectors. This \u201cAcademia Parisiensis\u201d, as it came to be called, brought together men such as \u00c9tienne Pascal, Mydorge, Hardy, Roberval, Fermat. It was later to welcome the young Blaise Pascal, and Jacques Le Pailleur who was to become the group\u2019s leader when Mersenne died in 1648. Discussions were mostly \u201cmathematical\u201d (MC V: 209). Mersenne used to submit problems of his own invention to his friends, and some were often remarkably stimulating and the origin of important discoveries such as the \u201croulette\u201d problem, solved by Roberval in 1634; and then more indirectly by Fermat and Descartes. Mersenne himself undertook to establish a first list of what will eventually be called the \u201cMersenne primes\u201d, prime numbers that can be written in the form 2n \u2212 1 (for some integer n), whose properties and determination are still topical questions in contemporary mathematics. Mersenne envisaged his meeting group, and his own net of correspondents, as the prototype for a larger institution that would bring scholars together in a pacified Europe, foreshadowing the foundation of the later Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 1666, or the Royal Society in England (MC V: 301\u2013302, and Goldstein 2013)\n\nIn 1623 and 1625, Mersenne published three massive philosophical works. The Questiones celeberrimae in Genesim (which covers almost 1900 folio columns), a commentary on the six first chapters of the book of Genesis, larded with long scientific and philosophical digressions, was intended as an apology of Christian religion against all forms of \u201catheism\u201d. It contains attacks on various Platonist, cabbalistic and hermetic authors such as Bernardino Telesio, Pietro Pomponazzi, Giordano Bruno, Jacques Gaffarel, or the English hermetic author, Robert Fludd. The tone is virulent, sometimes offensive, and the book attracted several outraged answers. Fludd in particular reacted in his Sophia cum moria certamen (1629) which itself drew a long reply from Gassendi, writing upon Mersenne\u2019s request (Gassendi 1630). The same inspiration governs L\u2019Impi\u00e9t\u00e9 des D\u00e9istes, published in French the next year. It is a point-by-point refutation of the 106 Quatrains du D\u00e9iste or Anti-Bigot, a long anonymous poem denouncing Christian revelation, bigoted superstition and belief in a personal God. Mersenne\u2019s response, written as a dialogue between a deist and a theologian, leads to the conversion of the deist, to whom the existence, justice and mercy of the Christian God are demonstrated. Dedicated to Richelieu, and perhaps written on command, the book may be seen as taking part in a larger campaign orchestrated by the French state and the catholic church, at a time that witnessed Vanini\u2019s execution in Toulouse, the trial of Theophile de Viau, and a strengthening of repressive measures against anti-Aristotelian philosophical novelties. La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences (1625) is a dialogue between an alchemist, a skeptic and a Christian philosopher, the latter opposing both the over-confidence of the first and the excessive doubts of the second. The second, third and fourth parts of the book, dealing with arithmetic and geometry, is an 800-page compilation of ancient and recent achievements in the mathematical sciences, intended to show that there are regions of human knowledge immune from doubt, and which do not contradict Christian wisdom.\n\nBy the end of the 1620s, Mersenne\u2019s former animosity towards the anti-aristotelians authors withered, giving way to a more lenient if not tolerant approach. Galileo whom he had listed among the dangerous ones in 1623 is now the object of great praise. Mersenne seemed much less concerned with the proliferation of atheists and heretics, and he expressed regrets about the offensive tone of his previous works (Letter to Rivet 12 nov. 1639, MC X: 599). His travel to Holland in 1630 put him in contact with Protestant scholars, such as Andr\u00e9 Rivet and the Socinian Ruarus, who became regular correspondents. Mersenne who used to vilify the heretics, was now taken to task for his sympathies with the enemy, and he was sometimes dubbed the \u201cHuguenot monk\u201d. In any case the staunch defense of orthodoxy of the first works is nowhere to be found in Mersenne\u2019s next publications, which, from 1634 onward, are almost entirely devoted to the promotion of the mathematical sciences, broadly conceived. It has been a question among biographers and commentators whether these changes reflect a conversion to a new agenda or a new philosophical outlook. Robert Lenoble (1943: 38) considers that until 1634, Mersenne was still looking for a better philosophy of nature and held provisionally to Aristotelianism, \u201cwhereas at that date he discovered what he had sought for many years, namely Mechanism\u201d. Sylvie Taussig (2009b) considers that Mersenne went through a serious crisis, both moral and intellectual, at the end of the 1620s, and that under the influence of Peiresc and Gassendi he came to adopt a more skeptical outlook on philosophical and religious matters. Without denying Mersenne\u2019s change of tone and accent, Garber (2004) and Dear (1988) tend to underplay the extent and meaning of Mersenne\u2019s \u201cconversion\u201d to the new philosophy, considering that his agenda of promoting mixed mathematics was to him still compatible with a traditional philosophical outlook\u2014\u201cthe learning of the schools\u201d, that Dear described as conjoining Christianized Aristotelianism, Renaissance humanism and a skeptical or probabilistic approach to philosophical matters. We shall come back to these issues in due course.\n\nThe five treatises published in a row in 1634 are representative of the kind of intellectual productions Mersenne would henceforth offer. Two of them (Questions inouyes, and Questions th\u00e9ologiques\u2026) are eclectic lists of \u201ccurious\u201d questions, intended for entertainment (r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation) as well as for instruction of the learned: can one walk on water without miracle? How many grain of sands can be contained in the sphere of the earth ? From where does the satisfaction come when one believes one has found a new demonstration or truth? In these questions metaphysical, apologetic and even theological considerations are (in spite of the title of the second treatise) barely present. The Questions harmoniques and the Pr\u00e9ludes to the harmonie universelle prepare the way for the publication of Mersenne\u2019s great achievement on musical theory, The Harmonie Universelle (1636\u20137), where he offers what is still considered a major contribution to the scientific understanding of \u201cconsonance\u201d and acoustics. Finally the Mechaniques de Galil\u00e9e illustrate Mersenne\u2019s constant interest in physico-mathematical questions of Galilean type, that is Archimedean mechanics stricto sensu, dealing with basic machines, such as the lever, the wheel, the pulley, but also the sciences of motion, free fall, ballistics, pneumatics, hydrostatics, and optics. Mersenne pursued these interests in the 1640s, when he started to make his own campaigns of experiments in order to verify Galilean numerical data on free fall and on the velocity of a cannon ball, especially during his journey to Italy (1644\u20131645) where he met Torricelli. These researches resulted in the publication of his Cogitate physico-mathematica (1644) and his Novarum observum physico-matheaticarum (1647), which includes in its first part a treatise by Roberval on the system of the world. A book on optics was to be published after Mersenne\u2019s death (L\u2019Optique et la catoptrique, 1651).\n\n2. Scientific Apologetics\n\nMersenne was indubitably an heir to the Thomistic view of a necessary synthesis between Christian faith and philosophy. As expressed in the praefatium of the Quaestiones in Genesim, it is \u201ca duty of the learned to refute atheists\u201d, the tacit assumption being that \u201ctrue philosophy never contradicts the teachings of the Church\u201d (ID II: 490\u20131). This synthesis was vindicated in the rather troubled political, and religious context of early seventeenth-century France, which still bore the scars of half a century of religious wars, and appeared exposed and vulnerable to what Catholics considered a severe crisis of orthodoxy, raging on all fronts. A rising tide of libertines, deists, skeptics, cabbalists, alchemists, and naturalist metaphysicians, all more or less consciously in league with the Protestants, seemed to Mersenne on the verge of overwhelming the \u201ctrue\u201d Christian faith. Mersenne often pointed out the connection between Protestantism and the various forms of heterodoxy and atheism: the Calvinist belief in predestination insensibly drives men toward superstition and atheism, as it appears more difficult to believe that God wants our damnation, than to represent Him as a \u201ccruel Saturn who devours his children\u201d, or simply to own that there is no God at all (ID II: 589). So, Mersenne\u2019s early-interventions may be seen as taking part in the larger movement of \u201cre-catholization\u201d of the French state after the pacification allowed by the Edit de Nantes. In this regard, Mersenne\u2019s advocacy of a harmonious conciliation of faith and reason was not without similarities with a noted feature of Galileo\u2019s \u201ccultural program\u201d in the same years: both wanted to contribute to the Counter-Reformation, and both defended the specific idea that Catholics should not leave to Protestant heretics the monopoly of reason and scientific knowledge. Mersenne was however wary of any anti-Aristotelian philosophical novelties (including those of Galileo himself), as he saw them as ipso facto dangerously verging towards contesting religious truth. According to Garber (2004), the Aristotelian framework, particularly prominent in the first works, was adopted not so much for its philosophical virtues as such, but rather as a rampart of orthodoxy, as a tried doctrine, that has long proved its ability to be harmoniously conjoined with Christian faith, and as it were to protect it. By contrast, alternative ways of thinking offered no such guarantee against heresy, as they were often defended with a zeal that was dangerously close to fanaticism. As Mersenne stated in the preface to the Quaestiones (1623):\n\nThese men who desire to found a new philosophy, and to demonstrate it from fundamental principles, never regard the glory of God. Rather they strive with an ignorant obsessive zeal [cacozelia], by which they seek to shake up and overturn the Catholic religion, if they are able to do it\u2014unless I am mistaken. (QG Praefatio, translated in Garber 2004: 141)\n\nThus it seems quite clear that the stakes of a book like the Quaestiones were not simply a defense of natural religion but also, and perhaps primarily, a defense of catholic faith (and its mysteries) against the caricature conveyed in a growing number of writings, that represented it as resulting from superstition and ignorance:\n\nIt is appropriate to Catholics, and especially to theologians to know the sciences and to scrutinize God\u2019s works, not only because we thus receive the meaning of His will as from the pages of a Book, but also because we show how unfounded is the atheist\u2019s representation of Catholics as melancholic, agitated with thousands scruples and superstitions. (QG: col 2 \u2013 translation here and elsewhere from the author, unless otherwise indicated)\n\nTo realize this aim, Mersenne\u2019s strategy was twofold: polemical and constructive. On the one hand he attacked his polymorph enemy with the rhetorical instruments of a skilled debater, using the weapons of the adversaries, or making one refute the other (as in the dialogue between the alchemist and the skeptic in the first book of La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences). Hermetic authors such as Robert Fludd, or cabbalistic Christians such as Giovanni Pico and Jacques Gaffarel were vehemently denounced, as they availed themselves of spurious allegorical interpretations of the Bible. Even when their reading of the Bible is not wrong, they are dangerous as they make people believe they can deduce a priori, or through divine inspiration, what can only be known a posteriori, through revelation and experience. Heretic tendencies were pointed out in the doctrines of the Alchemists, who, in the wake of Paracelsus\u2019s Mysterium magnum, tried to give naturalist interpretations of Christian mysteries, such as the resurrection or the miracle of Creation. Mages, sorcerers, and adepts of esoteric mysteries such as the Rosicrucians prosper on men\u2019s propensity to superstition. Naturalist metaphysicians\u2014Bruno, Campanella, Pomponnazi\u2014who endowed nature with creative powers, verge dangerously toward pantheism, casting doubt on creation, on the transcendence and freedom of God. A leading thread in all these criticisms, is the idea that the Catholic belief in miracles and mysteries, far from being superstitious, is much more attuned to sound reason than the doctrines that are opposed to it. A light knowledge of philosophy may induce some doubts, but the more one knows the sciences, the more these Catholic beliefs and mysteries are reinforced and may be vindicated against false religion and atheism. A smattering of knowledge in optics can for example cast doubt on the truth of divine epiphanies, but a better knowledge of this same science allows one to exclude the idea that miracles can be illusions caused by reflections or refractions and therefore makes more sensible their divine origin (QG: col. 522, 538). This sort of negative argument shows that Mersenne\u2019s rationalist defense of religion allows for truths beyond the capacity of men\u2019s reason. In this, Mersenne stand explicitly against the deist. Both allowed for \u201cnatural religion\u201d, but whereas the deist denounced the superstition and anthropomorphism of popular belief, Mersenne reversed the attacks and denounced the far worse anthropomorphism of one who measures God by human reason: \u201cit is feebleness of the mind, to believe that our finite understandings can comprehend the divine attributes or acts\u201d (ID I: 318\u20139; see also ID I: 669\u201370, and Beaude 1980). This however should not be understood as revealing a secret inclination towards fideism: religion teaches truths which surpass reason, \u201cnot in destroying it, but rather in perfecting it\u201d (ID I: 680).\n\nMersenne\u2019s criticisms are based on a careful reading and exposition of the adverse doctrines, to the point that Mersenne has been sometimes taken to task for offering the enemies of religion a much too complacent advertisement. It has been remarked (Carraud 1994: 152) that the discourse of others (le discours d\u2019autrui) holds a distinctive place in Mersenne\u2019s writings: it is neither dismissed as in Descartes, nor deftly re-appropriated as in Leibniz, but rather faithfully produced and reported in order to be discussed on its own level and according to its own merits. This is the case, for example with the cabbalistic \u201csefirot\u201d and numerological methods which are patiently, almost sympathetically, expounded in the Impi\u00e9t\u00e9. The same holds for Giordano Bruno\u2019s doctrine. However heretical the man was, his arguments in favor of the infinity and plurality of the worlds (from his De Infinito) are not simply dismissed or brushed aside. The Christian philosopher reports them quite accurately in the second part of the Impi\u00e9t\u00e9 des d\u00e9istes, before answering and criticizing them.\n\nApart from its polemical intent, Mersenne\u2019s \u201cscientific apologetics\u201d may be seen as articulating a natural theology together with a \u201csacred physics\u201d or \u201csacred mathematics\u201d. On the one hand a host of rational arguments\u2014some of them borrowed from the sciences, some from traditional metaphysics\u2014are brought in to prove God\u2019s existence and demonstrate His attributes. This natural theology is where Mersenne articulates his main ideas on metaphysics and we shall come back to it in the next part of this article. On the other hand, science is used as an instrument of exegesis. The Quaestiones in Genesim contains thus numerous scientific excursuses whose aim is either to give a scientific (mainly mathematical) exposition of a biblical content\u2014as when Mersenne \u201ccalculates\u201d what should be the size of Noah\u2019s ark, or suggests that our knowledge of architecture should help us to see the excellence of the temple of Solomon\u2014or to illustrate a Catholic mystery (such as the triadic unity of God or the miracle of the Creation) through a mathematical analogy.\n\nThis edifying use of mathematics is perhaps the hallmark of Mersenne\u2019s writings. It is still very much present in later publications (such as the Harmonie Universelle). The minim is literally fascinated by the almost magical properties of numbers and geometrical figures, where the most surprising and complicated objects and properties are generated from the simplest principles. This gives him a general analogy for religious truths. There are \u201cthousands of things in the mysteries of faith\u201d that are \u201cincomprehensible to the pagan and to a peripatetic philosopher\u201d, but that may be made understood by a \u201cChristian Euclid\u201d (un Euclide chr\u00e9tien) : Mathematics makes the relation of the infinite to the finite sensible, showing how an infinite motion can be made in a finite space. It can thus \u201cexplain\u201d the union of the two natures in the same divine person. Although the mathematical point is the humblest object, \u201cthe minim of geometry\u201d (HU III: Livre de l\u2019Utilit\u00e9 de l\u2019Harmonie, 16), it is in a sense the closest to God itself. Both are simple, without parts. The point engenders the line and together with the line, the surfaces, and with lines and surfaces the bodies. This gives us an insight on how God engenders the son, the son and God together, the holy spirit, and then all together the universe. Unity contains all numbers eminently, as God contains all created acts and all creatures, etc (ibid. 16\u201317). Mersenne also likes to suggest mathematical analogies illustrating, or symbolizing moral virtues. Thus, as the height of a triangle is measured by a perpendicular line elevated from the basis, the goodness of our actions is measured by the righteousness of our intention (\u201cla droite intention\u201d, VS I: 12). Mixed mathematics, optics, music and mechanics are also mobilized in the moral use of mathematics. For example:\n\nmechanics teaches us to live well, either by imitating heavy bodies which always seek their center in the center of the Earth, just as the spirit of Man must seek his own center in the divine essence which is the source of all our spirits, or by maintaining ourselves in that perpetual moral and moderate balance which consists of rendering all that belongs to Him first of all to God and then to our neighbor. (MC IV: 208\u201309)\n\nThe philosophical value of Mersenne\u2019s apologetics may be differently assessed. Mersenne seemed to pay little attention to contemporary arguments according to which the Bible is not to be taken literally on questions dealing with nature (see, e.g., Galileo\u2019s 1615 Letter to Christina). His exegesis indeed offers a rather rough example of what will be later called \u201cconcordism\u201d, the conception that there cannot be any discrepancy between the teachings of the sciences and those of the Bible, taken in the most literal sense. However, the most distinctive aspect of Mersenne\u2019s apologetics, the edifying use of mathematics, although sometimes na\u00efve in its formulations, did have philosophical influence. Pascal, who does not spare his sarcasm on those who think they can \u201cprove God from the course of the moon and the planets\u201d (Pascal 1963: 599, fg. 781), is nevertheless quite faithful to Mersenne\u2019s use of mathematics, when he discusses men\u2019s disproportion and God\u2019s greatness from the mathematical model of the infinite divisibility of space, or from a speculation on the two infinites whose terms are reminiscent of similar passages from the Impi\u00e9t\u00e9.\n\nBesides, although Mersenne\u2019s \u201cscientific apologetics\u201d was primarily conceived as a defense of religion against \u201catheists\u201d, where science is only a tool, it turned out to be also a defense of mathematical sciences against whoever might think that they are vain curiosity and must be either rejected, or at least relativized as inessential knowledge\u2026 This is especially manifest in the later works, where Mersenne gave free rein to his passion for mathematical sciences. Whereas natural theology and anti-deistic polemic were no longer dominant themes, he still vindicated the \u201cusefulness\u201d of mathematics, not only for men\u2019s welfare, but for their edifying virtues. In the next decades, one could find similar moves in defense of the \u201cusefulness of natural experimental philosophy\u201d in the works of Robert Boyle.\n\n3. Metaphysical Issues\n\n3.1 Metaphysics as Rational Theology\n\nIn the Quaestiones, Mersenne offered a tripartition of the theoretical sciences: metaphysics considers \u201ctrans-natural objects, such as God and the angels, that are actually separated from all matter\u201d; doctrinal sciences\u2014that is mathematics\u2014deals with objects that are \u201cin truth material, but considered abstracted from matter, such as the line and the figure\u201d; natural sciences (physics) considers \u201cmaterial things as such, for example the heavens or the elements\u201d. (QG: col 92\u20133). In La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 (VS I: 50), Mersenne suggested that metaphysics, although an abstract science, like logic and mathematics, is nevertheless closer to physics, in so far as their shared aim is to consider \u201cthings as they are in themselves\u201d, and not simply things as they appear to our senses\u2014in this both sciences \u201care rightly called sapience\u201d. He was later to revise this coupling, suggesting in his Questions inou\u00efes (QI: 54) that metaphysics is closer to mathematics, on account of the fact that, contrary to physics, metaphysics and mathematics both consider immutable and eternal objects, and are the only ones among the sciences capable of being really possessed by men here below.\n\nThe definition of metaphysics given in the Quaestiones is strongly reminiscent of Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics E1\u2014where \u201cprime philosophy\u201d is conceived as strictly concerned with the separated or immaterial substances, thus with the \u201ctheological\u201d realm. Jean-Luc Marion (1994) pointed out that although Mersenne, in several places, acknowledges formally another traditional object for metaphysics, that is the \u201cens quatenus ens\u201d (the abstracted Being as such, whose science applies indifferently to all beings, created or uncreated), he seemed reluctant to give this science (that we now call ontology) any substance. In a striking passage from the Quaestiones, Mersenne said that \u201cBeing\u201d is a name that suits God better than any of the creatures:\n\nAmong all names \u201cbeing\u201d is the one that we should ascribe to God, rather than all the other ones naming the perfections of creatures\u2026 God could justly say \u201cI am all Being, as I contains all things more perfectly than they can contain themselves\u201d. This is why all creatures could say \u201cmy name is non-Being, or non-entity\u201d (Non Esse, seu non Ens), as, according to Plato, truly all things except God have non-being rather than being. (QG: col. 21)\n\nIn later works the specificity of ontology was quickly dissolved into logic on the one hand (an abstract science which shares with ontology the same principle of non-contradiction, see VS 52\u201355) and into rational theology on the other hand, the science of immaterial beings and first causes. This dissolution may be seen as anticipating Descartes\u2019s own reduction of metaphysics to \u201cprime philosophy\u201d, and, according to Marion, this is a very significant (albeit a merely negative one) legacy of Mersenne\u2019s work to the history of metaphysics.\n\n3.2 Proofs of God\u2019s Existence\n\nThe bulk of Mersenne\u2019s contribution to rational theology is contained in the 700 or so first columns of his Quaestiones in Genesim, where no less than 35 proofs of God\u2019s existence are reckoned and detailed. The importance of rational demonstration is directly related to the apologetic project: one cannot simply be content with the idea that God is immediately known, as this could not shut the mouths of the atheists. The encyclopedic turn of the recension is obvious, and Mersenne, ready to use all means available to contradict the atheists, was not taken aback by the fact that these proofs belong to various, and sometimes adverse, theological traditions. After summoning the consensus of all creatures, and the consensus of all men, Mersenne resorted to cosmological arguments, arguing, from the contingency of our word, and the contingency of our own finite existence, that \u201cit is necessary that something exists by itself\u201d. Here Mersenne borrowed from Hugues of Saint Victor and Jean Damascene.\n\nHe also presented at some length the Anselmian argument, arguing that existence should be attributed to God, on account of the fact that the very idea of God (that even the insane atheist should have in his mind) obliges us to consider that nothing greater can exist, and that existence in re is obviously a greater thing than existence in the mind. Mersenne, who did not mention Aquinas\u2019s criticisms, found the argument \u201cexcellent and very pious\u201d (QG: col 37). He also paid much credit to the Augustinian argument from \u201ceternal truths\u201d\u2014Mathematical truths in particular would not be possible without the supposition of an eternal mind in which they reside:\n\nopen your mind\u2019s eyes, \u00f4 atheist, and see how numerous and strong are the arguments through which arithmetic asks you to embrace the divine unity, without which Arithmetic would not hold, as all material unity or numerical is impossible without the supposition of divine unity. \u2026 One objects to the atheist\u2019s geometry, if ever one listens to Plato who recognizes God from this very science, as he said that God never ceases to practice geometry. (QG Praefatio: a2)\n\nIt is to be noted that the two a priori arguments (from eternal truths and from the idea of a perfect being) are the only two that are brought in in the Impi\u00e9t\u00e9 to dispel atheism. In the Quaestiones however more than half of Mersenne\u2019s arguments were a posteriori ones: from the creation ex nihilo, from the beauty of creatures, from the given natural law, from the harmony of the universe\u2026 All allowed lengthy scientific excursuses, demonstrating God\u2019s intelligence and providence through whatever the sciences can show of the order of things. Among these arguments, Mersenne paid only lip service to the classical Aristotelian and Thomist \u201cargument from motion\u201d, which states that the world needs an immutable first mover, probably because he is aware that the argument had been used in Paduan Aristotelianism in order to defend the coeternity of the world and its first mover. In the other a posteriori proofs, the regressive move from the creation to the creator was not as likely to subject the creator to the creation.\n\nProminent in the Quaestiones and Impi\u00e9t\u00e9, rational theology tended to recede in importance in subsequent works. Although in the Quaestiones, Mersenne had hinted at another work (\u201cperfectum opus\u201d) to come, it was never written. After 1624 he became more reluctant to consider proofs of God\u2019s existence, hinting in his correspondence with Ruarus that it might not be possible to give a truly demonstrative one, however sensible and approved by everyone was the truth of God\u2019s existence. His doubts were now on a par with the ones he came to entertain regarding demonstrations in physical matters. In his Questions th\u00e9ologiques, he wrote in a somewhat autobiographical tone, that everyone could see for themselves that:\n\nfresh from the Philosophy and Theology courses, they used to imagine that they could give a reason for everything, whereas 20 or 30 years later they are compelled to confess that they know no reason that satisfies them and is so evident and certain that they cannot doubt it. (QT: 10)\n\nThis may shed some light on Mersenne\u2019s role in the writing of the second objections to Descartes\u2019s Meditations, where doubts were cast on the demonstrative character of the Cartesian proofs of God\u2019s existence, and especially on the ontological proof, whose Anselmian version was so much favoured by Mersenne in his younger years. It has been argued (Garber 2001), quite convincingly, that Jean-Baptiste Morin, a member of the Mersenne circle, and the author of a booklet on God\u2019s existence written in a geometrical fashion (Morin 1635) had an important hand in the composition of the second objections and that he was probably the one who suggested the request of presenting the Meditations arguments in a geometrical manner. Mersenne, however would have concurred with the reservations, implicit in this demand, concerning Descartes\u2019s claim to the higher certainty of metaphysical demonstrations over mathematical ones.\n\n3.3 Voluntarism\n\nVoluntarism was an important feature in Mersenne\u2019s apologetics. Against what appeared to him dangerous necessitarian tendencies in Renaissance naturalist philosophies, he repeatedly advocated God\u2019s essential freedom in regard His creation. God chooses to exert his efficient, transitive causality in whatever way he will. This for instance explains why Mersenne always opposed the idea of an infinite universe. An infinite world, of the kind postulated by Giordano Bruno, would be very close to a necessary emanation of God, but it is neither required of God\u2019s infinite power, nor does it agree with the nature of a created thing :\n\nall that is produced is finite but God\u2019s potentia is without measure. No created object is adequate to it. (QG: col. 435)\n\nMersenne maintained that God is not constrained by His infinite power. As a free cause, he can chose to create a finite universe:\n\nwhy would God make a finite world, if He could make an infinite one? The answer is: God did not want to do anything else than what he did\u2014this however will not prevent us from believing He is all powerful, as we distinguish in God the work and the will [le faire et le vouloir]\u2026 it is bad reasoning to conclude an infinite effect from an infinite cause when the cause is not acting necessarily but freely. (ID II: 304)\n\nFor Mersenne the unique perfect egalitarian emanation of God would be an action ad intra, that is the action through which God contemplates (and loves) Himself in the persons of the trinity. When one comes to causality ad extra, such as creation, one has to distinguish (ID II: 311\u20132) between divine power and divine will. The first contains and addresses infinite possibilities, the second chooses, from among them, a finite assortment.\n\nVoluntarism concerning the nature and laws of creation may appear as an important common ground that Mersenne shared with orthodox (Thomist) scholasticism, and with Descartes. As Lenoble has shown, its assertion was an essential precondition for the establishment of a mechanical science, unifying the whole of nature under the contingent will of God, his initial decisions regarding the distribution and laws of matter and motion. Mersenne\u2019s voluntarism implies that physics is not about an eternal and immutable object, as God could have ordered the word in various manners and with various laws. This, as we shall see, has important epistemological consequences: God\u2019s freedom means that he is not compelled to create things in the simplest fashion. This is evidenced in the reign of the grace, where one can clearly see that God did not chose the shortest way to dispense his grace, as he could have assured our salvation with a unique act of his will (cf. Questions Inou\u00efes, p. 344\u20135] But this hold as well for scientific truths, and explains for example why Mersenne never considered as decisive Galilean and Copernican arguments for the motion of the earth taken from the simplicity of natural order. Mersenne\u2019s point was actually quite close to the argument from divine omnipotence that Pope Urban VIII suggested to Galileo in 1623, and that Galileo, somewhat ironically, put in the mouth of Simplicio in the concluding sentences of the 1632 Dialogo: Man cannot presume to know how the world really is, since God could have brought about the same effects in ways unimagined by humans (see Galileo, 1890\u20131909, VII, 488).\n\n3.4 Mersenne and Descartes on Eternal Truths\n\nMersenne did not extend his voluntarism to mathematical truths, as Descartes did in a rather unconventional way. The confrontation of Mersenne\u2019s and Descartes\u2019s positions on this theme has been the object of some discussions in the secondary literature\u2014see especially Marion 1980; Dear 1988; Carraud 1994; Fabbri 2008. Descartes first assertions on God\u2019s creation of mathematical truths appeared in a letter to Mersenne of April 15, 1630. Descartes enjoined his correspondent to tell everyone aloud that the mathematical truths that Mersenne called eternal were not independent of God, but \u201chave been created by him and depend on him entirely just as do all the other creatures\u201d (Descartes to Mersenne, April 15, 1630, AT I: 145). God freely established them, and impressed them in the minds of men, as a king would in his kingdom. The statement seems to have surprised Mersenne. The Minim\u2019s own letters are lost, but this can be inferred from the fact that Descartes in May and June 1630, obviously answers repeated requests for clarification:\n\nyou ask me in quo genere causae Deus disposuit aeternas veritates [in what kind of cause God has disposed the eternal truths]. I reply to you that it is in eodem genere causae [in the same kind of cause] that he has created everything, that is ut efficients et totalis causa [as efficient and total cause]. (Descartes to Mersenne, May 27 1630, AT I: 151\u20132). You ask what necessitated God to create these truths; and I reply that he was free to make it not true that all the radii of the circle are equal\u2014just as free as he was not to create the world. (27 mai 1630, AT I: 152)\n\nMersenne\u2019s own considerations on the status of eternal truths in God\u2019s intellect explain why he should have had qualms about Descartes\u2019s puzzling doctrine (which might amount here to no less than making mathematical truths somehow contingent, depending on the arbitrary will of God\u2014even though Descartes himself, who often points out the necessity of mathematical truths, never draws such consequence). Mersenne position seems closer to cardinal de Berulle\u2019s, and Augustine\u2019s exemplarism: eternal truths are exemplar ideas present in God\u2019s intellect and illuminating our own. They proceed from God\u2019s nature as His Verb, but they are not similar to creatures, they are not \u201cfreely\u201d created.\n\nWhen Mersenne considers God\u2019s relation to eternal truth he often uses metaphors of light and the emanatist vocabulary of Neo-Platonism\u2014for example in the Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019harmonie Universelle:\n\nI consider, therefore the divine essence as an eternal and infinite sun, which darts an infinity of rays on which depend all our perfections: the goodness of God is one of these rays, whence come our good inclinations, our virtues and our good works, the other is eternal truth, whence proceed all our truths and our sciences. (THU: 59\u201360, English translation in Dear 1988: 58)\n\nOr in the Questions th\u00e9ologiques:\n\nthe sciences are like the rays of divinity, and it is just as blameable to try to know them without God, than try to know the nature of colours, without knowing the nature of light, which gives them being and subsistence. (QT: 202)\n\nThe kind of causality implied here is a causality ad intra: eternal truths belong to God\u2019s nature. And in this regard, as they are \u201cformally\u201d in God and so to speak coeternal with Him, they should be considered as uncreated and necessitated, as God himself is not free towards His own nature:\n\nIt is patent that God is entirely free in regard everything that are contained only eminently in him, to produce them or not, as He is driven necessarily to whatever he embraces formerly as these things that are God himself are infinite, eternal, independent. (QG: col 436)\n\nThe idea that eternal truths exist necessarily in God, and do not depend on God\u2019s causality was not new, and Mersenne here belonged to a rather well established scholastic tradition. An original feature of Mersenne\u2019s position however is that he considered mathematical truths as the very paradigm of eternal truths. As pointed by Dear, this was not a received doctrine. Mathematics used to be considered not really worthy of the dignity of true sciences, on account of the inessential nature of their object and the non-causal character of their demonstrations. Mersenne, in the wake of Biancani (1615) defended the contrary view: mathematics are not only true sciences, but the highest among them, because of their certainty. Besides, their demonstrations are truly causal ones, as Mersenne showed with the example of numbers where unity appears to be the \u201cmaterial cause\u201d and the intellect, conjoining and composing unities, the \u201cefficient\u201d one (cf. VS II: 284). Thus mathematics is able to describe the objects that God\u2019s intellect considered when He created the world, that is the possibilia (Lenoble 1943)\u2014or, better said, mathematics are the sciences of the metaphysically necessary attributes of all things.\n\nOne important question that has been debated in the literature is whether Mersenne\u2019s position amounts to the idea that mathematical truths are truly independent of God. The discussion is not merely about the meaning one is willing to give to the word \u201cindependent\u201d whether it applies or not to something that is included in God\u2019s nature, but it engages deep issues in the history of metaphysical thought. According to Marion (1980), and Carraud (1994), the very fact that mathematical truths are considered as forming the essence of God\u2019s intellect means that they do not depend anymore on God\u2019s will. Apparently endorsing a doctrine that he found mentioned in Su\u00e1rez (1597, xxxi.12.40), Mersenne wrote in a much discussed passage of the Quaestiones:\n\nas other authors say, things are possible per se, independently of any cause, in virtue of the necessary connection and non-contradiction of terms. (col. 436)\n\nGod would be subjected to mathematical truths just as human intellects are. He would know them as we know them. This would be the sign that the doctrine of univocity entered Mersenne\u2019s thought, perhaps under the influence of Kepler, in an irretrievable fashion. This is also deemed to explain the striking disappearance of rational theology in Mersenne\u2019s writings. Just as metaphysics had been entirely exhausted by natural theology in the first works, rational theology ended up being entirely exhausted by mathematics. The latter are not anymore an analogical resource for theology, but indeed they furnish the only possible non-analogical discourse on God, \u201cthe hidden object of all mathematical discourse\u201d (Pessel 1987). As a consequence, Mersenne\u2019s apologetics no longer needs to appeal to rational theology\u2014the mere promotion of mathematical sciences has become the unique, or best, apology of Christian religion.\n\nPeter Dear criticized Marion\u2019s interpretation as implying something that he did not find in Mersenne, namely that mathematical truths exist in a kind of platonic separateness, so that God and men would be in the same relation to them, would see them the same way. This would imply that God is no more the author of them than men, whereas in Dear\u2019s view, Mersenne, always firmly maintained that eternal truths causally depend on God, being true emanations of his nature. Accordingly, Mersenne would not so much insist on independence but rather on co-implication and coeternity. Whereas Descartes used to\n\nsee the matter as straight choice between necessary truths holding simply because God knew them (having willed them) or God\u2019s knowing them because they are independently true. (cf. Descartes \u00e0 Mersenne 6 mai 1630, Descartes AT I: 149, and Dear 1988: 60)\n\nMersenne, a rather orthodox scholastic on this point, never recognized an alternative: both theses should hold together\u2014eternal truths are true because God knows them, and God knows them because they are true.\n\n4. Epistemological Issues\n\n4.1 Against the Skeptics\n\nMersenne\u2019s attitude towards skepticism was complex, changing over time and somewhat ambivalent. In L\u2019Usage de la raison\u2014a recently rediscovered booklet from 1623, whose authorship does not seem questionable\u2014one finds arguments against the vanity of the sciences that are strongly reminiscent of those expressed around the same time by \u201cChristian skeptics\u201d, such as Montaigne and Charron, or even Cornelius Agrippa, authors whom Mersenne sternly criticized in his next publications. Thus, in the \u201cDedicatory Epistle to Madame de Vitry\u201d, the Minim suggested that our time is badly employed in studying the sciences, which are plagued with insuperable uncertainty:\n\nwhenever we raise our eyes to the sky or incline it to the earth, we must owe that everything is unknown to us\u2026 Who can claim to know the number of the skies, their form, their matter, properties and accident? One can even find idle-dreamers Copernicans prepared to deny the motion of the skies\u2026 Who can say if Alchemists are right in their promises.\n\nThis uncertainty of the \u201cmegalocosm\u201d goes together with an equal puzzlement concerning the littlest creature of the micro-world, as recent microscopes have shown to the eye that \u201cit is pure ignorance to say that they are deprived of these several organs that can be seen in larger creatures\u201d. Further, (UR: 37\u201338) the author condemned Pythagoras, Archimedes, the alchemists, the algebraists, etc. for being so much attached to their inventions that they forget to think of God, and eternal glory\u2026\n\nThe change of attitude in the next published works is striking. On the one hand, in the Quaestiones and Impi\u00e9t\u00e9, skepticism was presented as a sequel to Calvinism; and the denunciation of human reason found in Charron and Montaigne, far from encouraging faith in the mysteries of Christian religion, was seen as inclining men towards atheism and libertinism. On the other hand, Mersenne was no longer denouncing the sciences indistinctly as vain curiosity, his general attitude towards speculative enquiry was much more positive, especially when one came to the mathematical sciences, whose apologetic virtues he wanted now to reveal. He maintained however that our reason is weak, contradictory, particularly in regard philosophical (i.e., physical) issues:\n\nif our reasons were not deceitful, how would it come that there is not any one question in Philosophy, that does not raise diverse opinions wholly contrary on the same subjects, all of which have their reason and nevertheless there is only one that is true. (ID II: 672)\n\nIn La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences contre les sceptiques et les phyrroniens, the tone changed again. Skepticism was no longer condemned as a seed of heterodoxy but only in so far as it discourages men from the practice of mathematical sciences. The skeptical character is obstinate, but he is no atheist nor heretic in the disguise (see Descotes, in VS, Introduction), and in the first part of the book, his arguments against the alchemist\u2019s dogmatism are often endorsed and even reinforced by the Christian philosopher.\n\nAgainst the epistemological optimism of the alchemist who considers himself to be in possession of the perfect science, the skeptic resorts to the traditional arguments of the academic school, emphasizing that certainty is nowhere to be found, as we have only a very partial and superficial knowledge of things. We perceive only the effects and not the profound nature nor the ultimate causes of things. The true essences evade us. The simplest objects (such as a sheet of paper) cannot be completely known, because of the infinite number of relations in which they are involved with other elements of the universe. It has been shown by G. Paganini that these arguments and examples are almost verbatim borrowed from the \u201csecond doubt\u201d of Campanella\u2019s Metaphysica, a manuscript that was in Mersenne\u2019s hands at the time he wrote La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences, but that he did not mention as his source (Paganini 2005 & 2008).\n\nIn chapter 11 and 12, the Christian philosopher presents the skeptical arguments in a new and more radical form. He gives an account of the ten skeptical tropes of Aenesideme, as Mersenne could have read them in Sextus Empiricus and Diog\u00e8ne Laertius. These tropes draw on the varieties of animal constitution in regard pleasures and pains, the idiosyncrasy of men, the disagreement of the senses, the varieties of circumstances and dispositions, such as health and disease, sleep and wakefulness, young age and old age. All show that the information of our senses is unreliable, just as the reasons we draw from them.\n\nIn answer to these doubts, Mersenne\u2019s Christian philosopher resorts to an eclectic strategy. On the one hand, he adopts the usual Aristotelian standpoint against skepticism regarding the senses: sense perception is trustworthy, provided that its exercise takes place in \u201cnormal\u201d and appropriate conditions. Errors occur only when the senses are affected by disease, or presented with objects whose distance, illumination, intensity, etc. exceed the normal range:\n\nAll the deceptions of senses that you object are of no use, for they only prove what we concede, namely that each one of our senses, in order to judge its object rightly must have all that its nature and the perfection of its operation require\u2014this granted, it never errs. (VS I: 15)\n\nOn the other hand, just as senses are the right judges of their own proper sensible\u2014the eye of color and light, the ear of sound, etc.\u2014human intellect also possesses an internal criterion which allows it to judge its own objects rightly. It has the use of \u201ca spiritual and universal light that it has of its own nature since the commencement of its creation\u201d (VS: 193). Here the inspiration is clearly Augustinian, as it is for Descartes\u2019s parent conception of \u201clumi\u00e8re naturelle\u201d. The light of the soul does not give men direct access to divine knowledge, knowledge of essences, as that would require an eternal glory and a supernatural light. But it still gives access to a number of evidentia, immediate certainties, whose truth, Mersenne concedes, depends on God\u2019s illumination and God\u2019s veracity. Thus, in every realm of knowledge or human interests, there are truths that are not capable of doubt, such as \u201cthe whole is greater than the part\u201d, or \u201cevil should be avoided\u201d.\n\nAnother Augustinian aspect of Mersenne\u2019s defense is the idea that doubt itself can be turned into a source of knowledge. For example, although there are differences in apprehension between various men, or between men and beasts, we do have the knowledge of such differences and this is something that cannot be doubted: \u201cat least one knows that the objects of the senses appear differently according to the diverse dispositions of the organs\u201d (VS: 193). Awareness of this sort of facts is what incites men to seek the laws of appearances\u2014for example, the optical and geometrical rules that govern variations in perspective. In other terms, it prompts them to engage into physico-mathematical enquiries.\n\nOn a similar line of argument, one could say, following Augustine in De Civitate Dei (1998, chapter XI, 26) that one cannot doubt that one doubts, unless admitting an infinite regress:\n\nI do not believe you doubt that [that we can learn science, with great contentment] because you experience this every day in yourself, and if you doubt it I ask whether you know that you are doubting; if you know it, you must know something, and consequently you do not doubt everything; an if you doubt that you doubted, I shall force you to admit infinite regress, which you say you reject, so that wherever you go, you must confess that there is some truth, and consequently you must say farewell to your Pyrrhonism. (VS I: 204)\n\nIn the next decade, reacting to the cogito argument in the Discours de la M\u00e9thode, Mersenne pointed out to Descartes how close his use of radical doubt was to that Augustinian argument (see Gouhier 1978).\n\n4.2 Mitigated Skepticism and Probabilism\n\nRichard Popkin has remarked that the great originality of La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences resides not so much in its arguments against the skeptics, as in the fact that this defense of \u201cthe truth of the sciences\u201d concedes so much to the skeptical outlook. Most of the skeptical claims that are propounded either by the skeptic or by the Christian philosopher are not really refuted in the book. They are integrated in a novel view of what one should expect of scientific enquiry, its true aims and prospects (Popkin 1956, 2003).\n\nThus, the Christian philosopher has no qualm with the skeptical rebuttal of the alchemist\u2019s claim to perfect knowledge in natural matters. He freely admits that we cannot know everything, and especially not the causes nor essences of physical things, that men\u2019s capacity is limited by outward appearance and the surface of corporeal things. In the Questions inou\u00efes, Mersenne went as far as to say that we cannot demonstrate the existence of the external world:\n\nAnd we do not have any demonstration by which we are able to persuade the opinion of those who might maintain that the earth, the water, the stars, and all the bodies which we see are but appearances and \u201cspecies intentionales\u201d, supposing God might use these species or accidents to make all that we see appear to us. For one is not able to say that one knows a single thing as one should\u2014according to the laws and the notions which Aristotle and other philosophers give of science\u2014if one cannot demonstrate that it is impossible that the reason which one supplies, or the thing which one proposes, be not true. That is enough to persuade those who use reflection that there is nothing certain in physics and that there are so few certain things, that it is difficult to propound any\u2026 (QI XVIII: 53, translated in Mace 1970: 24\u201325)\n\nMersenne joins the skeptic in his condemnation of the Aristotelian\u2019s far too optimistic view of science. What is denounced is not so much Aristotle\u2019s physical doctrines or methods (the Christian philosopher, for example, does not endorse the skeptical attacks against syllogistic) but rather a mistaken representation of the epistemic aims of physics, which cannot aspire to perfect certainty. Bacon\u2019s experimental method received no more favor in his eyes precisely on this account, as it serves a project that is no less dogmatic (see Buccolini 2013):\n\nalthough one may anatomize, and dissolve bodies as much as one wishes, whether by fire, by water, or by the force of the mind, one will never arrive at the point of rendering our intellect equal to the nature of things. That is why I believe that Verulam design is impossible. (VS 212)\n\nMersenne did not think that our inability to understand the ultimate cause and intimate nature of things should be an object of lament. The mere knowledge of effects and appearances might be enough for human needs. For one thing, it has enough pragmatic virtue, as it can serve us as a guide in our actions. Besides, as outwards appearances, crust and superficies may be rigorously described, through measurement and mathematics, the sort of knowledge that can be gained here is as perfect and certain as one could wish\u2014although not of the sort dogmatic physicians and metaphysicians are seeking.\n\nThus, according to Richard Popkin, Mersenne is not so much refuting skepticism as he is adopting an attenuated form of it. By openly discarding research on the causes and essences of phenomena, reducing the whole of physical science to mathematical knowledge of accidents, the study of external effects, and the establishment of the laws of appearances, he invents a \u201cmitigated skepticism\u201d, that Popkin considers as the first lucid expression of the modern scientific outlook, deemed to become dominant in the following centuries. This outlook conjugates an entire confidence in the virtues of physico-mathematical sciences, with a complete positivism (that is, a deliberate abstention) in regard metaphysical matters.\n\nRecent reappraisals of Mersenne\u2019s epistemological views tend to contest, or at least qualify, Popkin\u2019s characterizations. According to Garber (2004), Mersenne\u2019s epistemological frame is old rather than new. The way he envisions the boundaries between disciplines remains Aristotelian, and in particular his conception of the \u201cphysico-mathematical\u201d sciences directly comes from the Aristotelian definition of mixed or subaltern mathematics, sciences such as astronomy or optics, only dealing with accident and surface properties of physical things. Far from offering a scientific substitute to Aristotelian physics, these sciences allow one to approach nature in a mathematical way \u201cwithout having to challenge the full complex of Aristotelianism directly\u201d (2004: 157) in ways that would be perceived as subversive of true religion and social order.\n\nDear\u2019s study (1988) similarly insists on the deliberately \u201cun-revolutionary\u201d character of Mersenne\u2019s contribution to the \u201cscientific revolution\u201d. Mersenne never chose to range himself against Aristotelianism, never cast himself as an innovator. His agenda is formulated in a preexisting philosophical idiom (the \u201clanguage of the schools\u201d), and his ideas display a \u201cborrowed coherence\u201d rather than an intrinsic one. Mersenne was not a positivist avant la lettre; he admitted that God knows what man cannot verify, that natural kinds exist in nature, that things do have essential definitions. His \u201cskeptical\u201d approach to physics is not so much a watered-down Pyrrhonism intended to show the inconclusiveness of natural philosophical demonstration, as it is an instrument to recommend mathematical sciences as an anchor of certainty, where ordinary natural philosophy stays in doubt and can only be defended in a probabilistic way. When Mersenne confesses that many questions cannot he determined, he is not proposing to suspend judgment but rather to formulate a probable judgment by choosing the most persuasive opinions. This \u201cprobabilism\u201d is, according to Dear, a legacy of humanist and Ciceronian dialectics, and it remained constantly present in Mersenne\u2019s work, even though, on some questions the weight of probabilities has changed. This was particularly the case for the Copernican opinion. Judging it very unlikely in L\u2019Usage de la raison and in the Quaestiones, Mersenne eventually recognized that it was the opinion best suited to the phenomena observed and therefore the most probable. However, God\u2019s freedom being never constrained, Mersenne could accept with relative equanimity the final judgment of the Church. In his Questions th\u00e9ologiques, he was to publish a French translation of the inquisitorial condemnation and of Galileo\u2019s abjuration.\n\nDeparting from Garber and Dear\u2019s view as well as from Popkin\u2019s, Buccolini (2019) presents Mersenne\u2019s epistemological reflection in La v\u00e9rit\u00e9 des sciences as resolutely anti-sceptical, and strongly connected with the views expressed by the Jesuit mathematician, Guiseppe Biancani, in his dissertation on the nature of mathematics (Biancani 1615), arguing for the certainty and scientific status of mathematics. According to Buccolini, Mersenne\u2019s doubts are directed not against science as such but against the Aristotelian doctrine of demonstratio, his aim being to replace Aristotelian physics with an entirely intelligible mathematical physics.\n\n4.3 Mechanism and Experimentalism\n\nAccording to Lenoble (1943), Mersenne\u2019s mature works, focusing almost exclusively on \u201cphysico-mathematical\u201d sciences, witnesses the \u201cbirth of mechanism\u201d. However, as the term is not an actor\u2019s category of the 17th century, one should be careful in its use. Formulated in its own terms, Mersenne\u2019s standpoint regarding explanations in physics is that we can only understand what we can do:\n\nwe only know the real reasons for things that we can create with our hand and our mind; \u2026 and of all the things made by God, we cannot create any, no matter how much subtlety and effort we apply. (NO: 8; Lenoble 1943: 384)\n\nThis indicates both the foundations and limits of mechanistic explanations: finding reasons means showing how things can he produced by mechanical actions\u2014actions of the kind we are capable of when applying our bodies to external bodies. On the one hand, however, this mode of genetic explanation can provide only a very superficial clarification of created things, whose construction and complexity are either infinite, or go to details and minutiae that our senses are incapable of perceiving (OC: 89). On the other hand, these explanations cannot bear the character of necessity since they focus on objects that are fundamentally contingent and whose inner machinery could have been constituted differently, had God so wanted:\n\none knows all but nothing in physics, if one follows the definition of science Aristotle gave; for if it ought to be about eternal and immutable objects, and God can change everything that is in physics, one cannot make a science of it. (QT: 9)\n\nThe conjoined effects of Mersenne\u2019s epistemological pessimism and metaphysical voluntarism make his version of \u201cmechanism\u201d very different from the Cartesian, Hobbesian or Gassendist one. He never conceived mechanical explanations as a new science of \u201ccauses\u201d, based on the adoption of new principles and elements intended to take the place of Aristotelian substantial forms\u2014such as Descartes\u2019s subtle matter or Gassendi\u2019s atoms. Mechanics, as all other mixed-mathematics, was simply concerned with establishing the laws of phenomena.\n\nThis reflection on nature and the limits of mechanistic science was accompanied by truly experimental activity. Mersenne was convinced that mathematical sciences of nature cannot settle for common and vague observation. It urgently required \u201cwell-controlled and well-performed experiments\u201d (HU I: 167), facts that were artificially generated and precisely measured. Mersenne was aware that, even when rigorously performed, an experiment is not always enough to establish the law of phenomena: two series of experiments can diverge very little and yet express very different laws. Measurement can only be approximated, and this has a bearing on the certainty of mixed mathematics, which is partially compromised to the extent that it deals with physical objects. Reason must therefore, as far as possible, always accompany and discipline observation, without which one is vulnerable to considerable misunderstandings.\n\nMersenne made a considerable effort to do and redo experiments that his predecessors (most notably Galileo) had not always had the sense to present precisely. Thus, on the subject of the increase in speed during falling motion on an inclined plane, he conducted a precise campaign of measurements that enabled him to criticize Galileo\u2019s numerical results, and eventually express doubts on the validity of the law itself (Palmerini 2010). As usual, he expressed his reservations concerning our capacity to determine with certainty the causes of gravity: \u201cit is just as difficult to find the real cause as to demonstrate whether the earth is stable or mobile\u201d (Trait\u00e9 des mouvements) and he placed back-to-back the reasons put forward by his contemporaries\u2014positive and real quality, air pressure, magnetic attraction\u2014which could only partially account for the phenomenon in its precise numerical dimensions. As Peter Dear has shown, Mersenne\u2019s approach to the science of motion was inductive in nature, not centered, as it was in Galileo, on the abstract physical process, but rather on \u201ca generalized description of cases, whose details and precise parameters held an importance altogether lacking in Galileo\u201d (Dear 1994).\n\n5. Music and Universal Harmony\n\nOf all the mixed-mathematical disciplines in which Mersenne took an interest, music was undeniably the one to which he devoted the most effort and passion. His 1623 Quaestiones already included a long musicological digression on the therapeutic power attributed to the music of the Hebrews, and generally to the music of the Ancients, whose harmonics he dreamed of restoring. The idea was taken up and developed in the 1627 Trait\u00e9 de l\u2019harmonie universelle, published under the transparent pseudonym of \u201cSieur de Sermes\u201d. The science of intellectual music and the understanding of the proportions that govern nature, lost through negligence, must be restored and linked to the science of \u201csensual music\u201d, which addresses our hearing but which, separated from the former, is no longer able to fulfill its true function: elevating the senses above material objects, rather than linking them together. Mersenne\u2019s great work on musical theory, the eight books of Harmonie Universelle, was published from 1636 to 1637. It presents a great many editorial variants, as Mersenne never ceased to work on it, annotating his own copy. The important \u201cTrait\u00e9 de la nature du son\u201d, which constitutes the first part of the work, focuses on the study, undertaken in a mechanistic spirit, of acoustic quantities, their physical nature and their effects on physiology and passions. Mersenne, drawing on Isaac Beeckman, establishes experimentally the laws connecting the vibration, the length and tension of the strings, making an important contribution to acoustic science.\n\nEpistemological, metaphysical and aesthetic aspects are intertwined in Mersenne\u2019s musical agenda. Music was to Mersenne a mixed-mathematical science, just as astronomy, whose primary aim was to \u201csave the phenomena\u201d through more or less plausible hypotheses. The musical phenomena par excellence is \u201cconsonance\u201d, that is the fact that certain sounds put together are agreeable to the ear. Recent musical practices, new instruments and polyphonic music had disclosed new modes of consonance that were previously unknown, and Mersenne saw his proper task in an effort to find the best physico-mathematical hypotheses that would be able to account for them, and could be used to invent more \u201cperfect\u201d musical pieces (chants). Seeking such hypotheses, Mersenne relentlessly asked his correspondents how they could account for the fact that certain sounds put together are agreeable and others not. For example, in November 1627, he asked a correspondent in Rome:\n\nIf the said Galileus be at Rome or if you should know some other excellent mathematician-musician, I pray you to find out from him why, of all the sounds put together, only those which form the octave, the fifth, the third, and the sixth and their replicas are agreeable to the ear, and which of all the dissonances is the most disagreeable one and why. I have been told that the said Galilei knows this reason. (MC I: 603, translated in Mace 1970: 8)\n\nMersenne\u2019s own general hypothesis was that consonance was due to the coincidence of the vibrations of the air, which itself depended on certain exact ratios in the mechanical properties of the instrument, e.g., the length, tension and breadth of the strings. However, as consonance was judged by the ear rather than directly by reason, discrepancies were found. For example, experiments showed that the ear hears an octave when the tensions of the strings are in a ratio of 1 to 4.25, whereas the physico-mathematical, Pythagorean, hypothesis prescribed 1 to 4. So here one would have to find ways to correct, or \u201cdiscipline\u201d experience through reason, in a move that is quite typical of Mersenne\u2019s epistemology (see Dear 1988).\n\nIn spite of those discrepancies, Mersenne was truly fascinated by the fact that the human mind, in its musical appreciation, is so to speak attuned to mathematical harmonies. The perception of consonance although mediated (and perhaps distorted) by our feeling, is not mere sensual pleasure, as Descartes, for example, seemed to think. Properly understood, it has a rational dimension, as it discloses to men the \u201cuniversal harmony\u201d, the underlying mathematical order that is present at every level of reality, and that connects them together. Mersenne could have found in Kepler\u2019s Harmonices mundi the idea of such an archetypal harmony, ordering each level of reality, and innate to the human mind. He did not accept however Kepler\u2019s rather dismissive view of music, which had led him to define harmonics in purely geometrical terms, stripped from whatever is sensorial and \u201cacoustic\u201d in it.\n\nContrary to what is sometimes held, the seeming adoption of an integral mechanism in the last musical works is no renunciation of the metaphysical consideration in harmonics. According to De Buzon (1994: 127, my translation), the causes and effects of consonance are indeed treated physically, but the pleasure taken to harmonics, \u201calbeit an ordinary experience, is a phenomenon that is entirely theological\u201d. Musical pleasure shows both our destination and our state in this world. It raises us to the contemplation of the divine unity, which is so to speak embodied in musical unison:\n\nconsonances depend on the unison as lines on the point, number on unity, and creatures on God. That is why the more they approach it the sweeter they become; because consonances have nothing sweet nor agreeable but that which they borrow from union of their sounds, which is the greater as it approaches unison. (HU II: Livre Premier des consonances, 15, translated in Mace 1970: 13)\n\nBut musical pleasure also reveals our imperfect and sensuous nature. Thus, for instance, although \u201cunison\u201d is the simplest and most divine harmony, we tend to prefer in this world other, less perfect consonances and even dissonance.\n\nIn considering the general interconnection of sciences, Mersenne granted music an almost architectonic function. All the sciences borrow something from each other. As manifested in the encyclopedic character of the Harmonie Universelle, music was for Mersenne as the connecting principle of the various disciplines, allowing for their exposition. A thorough investigation of musical properties requires forays into theology, moral philosophy (the passions of the soul), optics, arithmetic and geometry, and of course mechanics as sounds are motions of the air, that have to be accounted for in a mechanical way. Conversely, and at a deeper level, music may be seen as a total science, theoretically capable of representing the proportions that exist between all parts of the mechanical universe:\n\nit is also easy to conclude that one can represent everything in the world and, consequently all the sciences, by means of Sound; for, since everything consists in weight, number and measure, and sounds represent these three properties, they can signify anything one wishes, excluding metaphysics. (HU 1: 43)\n\nIn particular music may teach men how, through motions, objects communicate their properties to the senses, which themselves are like instruments, more or less well attuned to the external motions of the sensible. Music would then become the general science of the properties of the sensible, a kind of general aesthesis uniting mixed mathematics in one universal science, whose acquisition would make our elevation to the consideration of the first cause easier (QT: 161)."}, {"url": "http://sherlockholmes.stanford.edu/issue3.html", "page_content": "Issue 3 : Hound, Chapters 1 and 2 printable view\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n\nWhen Arthur Conan Doyle first published his work in The Strand Magazine in 1891, he decided to present essentially serialized works in a new way. Sherlock Holmes, the main character of Conan Doyle's two short novels, A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four, would also be the hero of the stories in The Strand. Instead of writing another novel and presenting a chapter per week in the magazine, Conan Doyle hit upon a new idea: he would write a series of six loosely related stories about the same characters. That way, readers could read the stories in or out of order with no concerns about continuity.\n\n\n\nBy 1901, when The Strand had published 24 Holmes stories, and Holmes had been missing in action for eight years, Conan Doyle began work on a longer mystery story based on an old legend from Devon about a spectral hound that haunted a local family. It is not known whether he intended to use Sherlock Holmes in this story from the beginning, but, for whatever reason, Conan Doyle framed this novelette as a story from Watson's casebooks, supposedly taking place in the late 1880s. Unlike the earlier series of Holmes stories, Hound was serialized in nine parts, from September 1901 to April 1902, each leaving the narrative at an uneasy or suspenseful moment.\n\n\n\nNineteenth-century magazines that printed serialized literature brought mass entertainment to the middle class in an era when books were too expensive to be bought casually. The strategically placed cliffhangers that spiced up most serialized stories encouraged people to speculate about what they had read, thus bringing literature into their daily social interactions. When the long-awaited next installment finally arrived, people would gather in groups to read it aloud and savor ever word. Today, that experience is reproduced in a somewhat different form by popular weekly television series that generate what we call \"water-cooler talk.\" The excitement of savoring a story, sharing our thoughts with friends and family, and waiting to see \"what happens next\" is not foreign to us, but can only be experienced in the Victorian manner by slowing down and reading a text with others who share the thrilling uncertainty of narrative possibilities.\n\n\n\nAlthough The Strand's readers loved Hound, they were disappointed that Conan Doyle had not yet decided to resurrect Holmes definitively. That resurrection occurred in 1903 with \"The Empty House.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as a \"Penang lawyer.\"\n\nMost gentlemen carried walking-sticks in Victorian times\u00d1as a sign of status, not of infirmity. Presumably, those who walked extensively over rough terrain would put their walking-sticks to more than decorative use. Penang, formerly a British colony, is today known as Negeri Pulau Pinang and is a state of Malaya. The \"Penang lawyer\" is a knobbed walking stick made from a native palm.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.historytoday.com/archive/publication-hound-baskervilles", "page_content": "Arthur Conan Doyle sent Sherlock Holmes to his death at the Reichenbach Falls in 1893 because he did not want to be known for ever as \u2018the Holmes man\u2019. The public demand for more Holmes stories, however, and the fact that there was patently much more money to be made out of him eventually proved irresistible.\n\nThe tale of the great detective\u2019s Dartmoor adventure, which its author described as \u2018the inevitable relapse after repentance\u2019 and which became perhaps the best-known in the whole Holmes canon, first appeared in monthly instalments in the Strand Magazine between August 1901 and April 1902. In book form, The Hound of the Baskervilles: Another Adventure of Sherlock Holmes, with illustrations by Sidney Paget, was published in London in March 1902 by George Newnes, who printed 25,000 copies at six shillings each, with a further 15,000 copies for India and the British Colonies on April 2nd. The American edition of 70,000 copies at $1.25 came out on April 15th.\n\nMuch ink and accusations of plagiarism have been spilled over the story\u2019s origins. Conan Doyle\u2019s initial inspiration came from a young journalist friend named Bertram Fletcher Robinson, nicknamed \u2018Bobbles\u2019, with whom he spent four days on a seaside golfing holiday at Cromer in Norfolk in the spring of 1901. While they were there, Robinson told Doyle the legend of a ghostly hound on Dartmoor and the two men decided to write what the latter called \u2018a real creeper\u2019 together. Robinson lived at Ipplepen, near Newton Abbot in South Devon, and the two friends went there to investigate Dartmoor. Robinson wrote later that Doyle \u2018listened eagerly to my stories of the ghost hounds, of the headless riders and of the devils that lurk in the hollows \u2013 legends upon which I had been reared, for my home lay on the borders of the moor.\u2019 They stayed at Robinson\u2019s home and at Rowe\u2019s Duchy Hotel at Princetown near the prison, whose governor, deputy governor, chaplain and doctor solemnly came, as Robinson noted, \u2018to pay a call on Mr Sherlock Holmes\u2019, to Doyle\u2019s irritation. He and Robinson explored the moor together and appropriated the surname of Robinson\u2019s coachman, Harry Baskerville.\n\nDoyle decided early on to make the tale a Sherlock Holmes mystery, presumed to be an episode in Holmes\u2019 earlier career, before his fatal grapple with Professor Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls. Writing to the editor of the Strand Magazine, Herbert Greenhough Smith, to tell him about the new story, he stipulated that Fletcher Robinson\u2019s name must appear as joint author. \u2018I can answer for the yarn being all my own in my own style without dilution, since your readers like that. But he gave me the central idea and the local colour, and so I feel his name must appear.\u2019 This was finally watered down to a note added to the first part, recording Doyle\u2019s indebtedness to Fletcher Robinson, to whom \u2018this story owes its inception\u2019 and \u2018who has helped me both in the general plot and in the local details.\u2019 The British and American editions in book form also acknowledged Robinson\u2019s help.\n\nDoyle had told Greenhough Smith that \u2018as far as I can judge the revival of Holmes would attract a great deal of attention\u2019. This proved to be an understatement. The publication in the Strand Magazine was a sensational success. All over the country, queues formed to buy copies and the magazine had to go to a seventh printing for the only time in its history.\n\nWhether Robinson contributed anything much more to The Hound of the Baskervilles than the dog is not clear. He evidently had a share of the initial royalties, but comments he made at different times suggest that he himself was not really sure how much of the credit he deserved. The story\u2019s imaginative force and the skill in the telling surely came from Conan Doyle. However, Robinson, who died young in 1907, did help to bring Sherlock Holmes back to life. The huge success of The Hound on both sides of the Atlantic led directly to the resurrection of Holmes when Collier\u2019s Weekly in America offered such an enormous sum of money for new stories of the great man that Conan Doyle brought him ingeniously back from his watery grave in The Adventure of the Empty House."}, {"url": "https://chinafilminsider.com/headlines-from-china-stephen-chow-to-make-the-mermaid-2-and-tv-drama-the-mermaid/", "page_content": "Stephen Chow to Make \u2018The Mermaid 2\u2019 and TV Drama \u2018The Mermaid\u2019\n\nRecently, \u201cCall For Actors\u201d for \u2018The Mermaid 2\u2033 appeared on the internet, which indicates that Stephen Chow has started preparing for the shooting of \u2018The Mermaid 2.\u2019 In addition, \u2018The Mermaid\u2018 has been set to become a TV show, according to an announcement made by Stephen Chow and Shanghai New Culture Media in June during the Shanghai International Film Festival.
