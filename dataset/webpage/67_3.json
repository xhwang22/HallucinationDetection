He also stressed the importance of the Alaska Highway, which, when completed, was the only land route to connect Alaska with the mainland United States (through Canada).\n\nDimond was born on November 30, 1881, in Palatine Bridge, New York. After teaching from 1900 to 1903, he moved to Alaska in 1904 to work as a prospector and miner. Dimond also studied law, and in 1913 he was admitted to the bar and began practicing in Valdez, Alaska. Later that year he became the U.S. commissioner at Chisana, Alaska, where he worked with gold miners and their claims. In 1917 Dimond became the special assistant to the U.S. attorney in Valdez.\n\nDimond served as mayor of Valdez for nine years, from 1920 to 1922 and from 1925 to 1932. From 1923 to 1926 and from 1929 to 1932 he was a member of the Alaska Territorial Senate. In 1933 Dimond was elected as the Alaskan representative to the U.S. Congress, and he was reelected five successive times.

Dimond left Congress in 1945 to become a district court judge in Anchorage, Alaska.
