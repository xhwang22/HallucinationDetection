In pursuing the mission of this school through teaching and scholarly work, Afigbo produced works that established reconstructionist history, of African historical methodologies, and links between history and statecraft.

E. Afigbo, Obi Ikenga: The Case for a Pan-Igbo Centre for Igbo Studies(Uturu, Nigeria: Abia State University, 2000).\n\nThe Ahiajoku Lecture Series, which was inaugurated on November 30, 1979, was designed to offer the Igbo a rare opportunity to annually gather and harness the intellectual richness of the people through public lectures by the most erudite of Igbo scholars. It is an annual intellectual harvest in which a distinguished Igbo scholar is selected to educate and share an important aspect of Igbo life and culture related to the lecturer\u2019s expertise. Thus, Ahiajoku lecturers have focused on Igbo political, economic, cultural, social, technological, philosophical and historical experiences, as well as the people\u2019s interactions and encounters with non-Igbo ethnic groups in Nigeria, and with the Europeans. It is an occasion to celebrate the collective Igbo achievements.\n\nFor more information on this Directorate, see Arthur A.

It is expected of an effective teacher or professor to strive to accommodate his or her students\u2019 individual differences and needs. But Afigbo was not for the mediocre or even average students. You must be above average and hardworking in order to survive Afigbo\u2019s scrutiny. The author started her doctoral thesis with Professor Afigbo, but did not complete the work with him due to no fault of theirs. Afigbo and the author worked very hard to complete the thesis, but it was not possible due to his retirement from the university in 1992.\n\nSee, for instance, E. Isichei, A History of the Igbo People(London: Macmillan, 1976), xiv.

This prejudicial characterization of the region and the period suggests a lawless and unstable atmosphere incapable of fostering any meaningful commercial and intergroup exchanges. Yet, historical accounts have shown that the Aro, Awka, Abiriba, Nkwerre, Aboh, Nike, Nri, Igala, Ijo, Bonny, Nembe, Brass and the Efik triumphed in their business careers before the 1900.\n\nFor the practice of Igbandu, see Felicia Ekejiuba, \u201cIgba Ndu: An Igbo Mechanism of Social Control and Adjustment,\u201d African Notes8, no. 1 (1972): 9\u201324.\n\nSee Richard Henderson, The King in Every Man: Evolutionary Trends in Onitsha Ibo Society and Culture(New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1972); Austin Shelton, The Igbo-Igala Borderland: Religion and Social Control in Indigenous African Colonialism(Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1971); and John Boston, \u201cNotes on Contact between the Igala and the Ibo,\u201d Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria2, no. 1 (1960): 52\u201358 on the impact of Igala culture on Nsukka Igbo; Basden, Niger Ibos on the Ijo and the conquest of southern Igbo; Mervin D.

At Ihube Central School Afigbo's brilliance manifested early which made his teachers encourage him to go to secondary school in spite of the opposition of his parents who were intimidated by the cost of post-primary education. He succeeded in his bid and went to St. Augustine's (CMS) Grammar School, Nkwerre Orlu in Imo State.[citation needed] with an Okigwe Native Administration scholarship won in a competitive examination. There again he came across a crop of teachers who left a definite imprint on him. Foremost among those were Mazi F. C. Ogbalu, a teacher of Igbo language and culture and the founder of the Society for Promoting Igbo Language and Culture, C.G.I. Eneli a history graduate of the University College, Ibadan and E. C. Ezekwesili, the principal of the college and a history graduate of the University of Southampton, UK. These three helped to determine his future academic career. From St. Augustine's Grammar School Afigbo gained admission to study history at University College, Ibadan (then affiliated with University of London), with a scholarship from the government of Eastern Nigeria. There again, he met scholars noted for their brilliance and beneficent influence \u2013 J.D. Omer-Cooper, J.C. Anene, J.F. Ade Ajayi and Kenneth Onwuka Dike. There were also his colleagues \u2013 Obaro Ikime and Philip Igbafe who not only read history with him, but with him went on to pioneer the \"made in Nigeria PhD\" at the infant University of Ibadan with the help of post-graduate scholarships awarded by the university to the best graduating students.[citation needed] Adiele Afigbo had not only graduated top of his class, but also was the first among his colleagues to complete his PhD With this, he became the first person ever to receive a doctoral degree from a Nigerian university.[1]\n\nEarly career\n\nOn obtaining the PhD, Afigbo was appointed a lecturer in history, a position he held for two years before fleeing to the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in the wake of the Nigerian civil war. During the duration of hostilities, he served in the Directorate for Propaganda of the Ministry of Information, Republic of Biafra. He resumed his interrupted academic duties after the war, and rose on the academic ladder \u2013 from Lecturer to Professor in 1972, thus reaching the top of his profession after only five years. A year after attaining to professorship, he was appointed the Head of the Department of History and Archaeology. The year after, he became also the Dean of the Faculty of Arts. On more than one occasion he held the Directorship of the Leo Hansbury Institute of African Studies. He held the following public appointments among others \u2013 pioneer Director of Research at the National Institute for policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, Jos; Commissioner first for Education and then for Local Government in the Government of Imo State; Chairman of the Michael Okpara College of Agriculture, Umuagwo in Imo State and Sole Administrator of the Alvan Ikoku College of Education, Owerri.[citation needed] He has also was awarded an Honorary Member of the Historical Association of Great Britain, Fellow of the Historical Society of Nigeria, the Nigerian National Order of Merit, the Fellowship of the Nigerian Academy of Letters. His traditional chieftaincy titles include Ogbute-Okewe-Ibe, Ogbuzuo, and Olaudah.\n\nWork as historian\n\nAfigbo was a historian of Africa, of Nigeria, of Southeastern Nigeria, and finally a historian of the Igbo. He was a political historian, an economic and social historian, and of historiography. Myth, History and Society, one of the three volumes of his essays edited by Toyin Falola is devoted to theorising on the methods of doing history in Africa, on the sources of history in Africa, on the place and purpose of history in Africa and other related issues. In many publications he sought to use the particular to illuminate the universal, and the universal to illuminate the particular. Thus, for instance, he used a detailed study of the textile process in Southern Nigeria to throw much helpful light on the socio-cultural dynamics of the societies of the region. In a similar manner he used the rise and expansion of the pre-colonial great states such as Benin to show that the so-called segmentary societies as well as the so-called mini-states of pre-colonial Africa are, among other things, fossilised reminders of the conditions from which the great states arose.[citation needed]\n\nAfigbo broke away from the action-reaction thesis that ruled the new African historiography when he joined the history profession. He did so by emphasising in his works basic reconstructionist history, the study of peoples and cultures in their own right.\n\nDeath\n\nAdiele Eberechukwu Afigbo died in Enugu, Nigeria in the early hours of Monday, 9 March 2009 after a brief illness.[2]\n\nWorks\n\nThe Warrant Chiefs: Indirect Rule in Southeastern Nigeria 1891\u20131929 (Longman, London, 1972)\n\n1891\u20131929 (Longman, London, 1972) Ropes of Sand: Studies in Igbo History and Culture (University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981)\n\n(University Press Limited, Ibadan 1981) The Igbo and Their Neighbours: Inter-group Relations In Southeastern Nigeria to 1953 (University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987)\n\n(University Press Limited, Ibadan, 1987) Groundwork of Igbo History (Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n(Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992) Image of the Igbo (Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992)\n\n(Vista Books Limited, Lagos, 1992) The Abolition of the Slave Trade in Southeastern Nigeria 1885\u20131950 (University of Rochester Press, 2006)\n\nCollected Works Edited by Toyin Falola\n\nNigerian History Politics and Affairs (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n(Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005) Igbo History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005)\n\n(Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2005) Myth, History and Society (Africa World Press, Trenton New Jersey, 2006)\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nOttenberg, S., Farmers and Townspeople in A Changing Nigeria (Spectrum Books Ltd, Ibadan, 2005) pp. 32\u201333, 50, 54, 84,101\n\nNorthrup, D.
