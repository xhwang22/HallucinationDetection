Catch them while you can on their one-night only performance here at the Fillmore Auditorium on the 12th of December. Gates will swing wide open starting at 6:00 pm.\n\nPunk music traces its roots back in the 80s, and has now morphed into all sounds and noises\u2026and yet, it still sounds pretty damn good, right? One of the punk pioneers and was responsible for the rebellious flame that still burns to this day is NOFX. They banded together 1983, founded by vocalist/bassist Fat Mike and guitarist Eric Melvin. Drummer Erik Sandin joined NOFX shortly after. In 1991, El Hefejoined to play lead guitar and trumpet, rounding out the current line-up.\n\nNOFX is the antithesis of most mainstream rock superstars around. They haven\u2019t been signed to any record label. They grant and consent only to very few select interviews. They only have a handful of music videos. They refused airplay of their music videos on MTV, VH1, and other video shows. They have songs that range to as short as 32 seconds, to as long as 18 minutes. They poke friendly-fun at fellow punk acts like The Offspring. They seem to have defied every rule in the music marketing rule book; yet their accomplishments could be the envy of aspiring indie bands. NOFX has released twelve studio albums, fifteen extended plays and a number of seven-inch singles; and has sold over 6 million records worldwide.\n\nIf you want pure, unadulterated, hardcore, the real-deal punk, you\u2019ve come to the right place.

The band consists of Matt Skiba (vocals, guitar), Dan Andriano (vocals, bass), and Derek Grant (drums).\n\n\n\nFounded in late 1996, by Matt Skiba, bassist Rob Doran and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, \u2018Sundials\u2019, in 1997.

In 2005, the band released \u2018Crimson\u2019 which expanded upon the band's punk rock influences, with prominent overdubs and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on \u2018Agony & Irony\u2019 (2008), which was released on V2 Records.\n\n\n\nIn 2010, the band released \u2018This Addiction\u2019 on its own label Heart & Skull and Epitaph.

In 2011 the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of \u2018Damnesia\u2019, which featured new, acoustic-based recordings of songs from across the band's career.

Araya and King were the only two constant members, with Lombardo twice replaced by Paul Bostaph and Gary Holt taking over guitar after Hanneman\u2019s death in 2013.\n\nSlayer rose to fame with its widely acclaimed 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the \u201cBig Four\u201d thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax, as well as being one of the heaviest and fastest metal bands of all time. Between 1991 and 2004, the band sold more than 3.5 million albums in the United States.\n\nSlayer\u2019s musical style involves fast tremolo picking, double bass drumming, riffs in irregular scales and shouted vocals. Throughout the band\u2019s career, King, Hanneman, and Araya have all contributed to the band\u2019s lyrics, which, along with some of their album art, cover topics such as serial killers, necrophilia, Satanism, religion, and warfare. As a result, album bans, delays, lawsuits, along with criticism from religious groups, far-right conservatives, and the media, spawned forth in response to Slayer\u2019s controversial subject matter. However, their music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually, and lyrically.\n\nStarting with its 1983 debut album, Show No Mercy, Slayer released twelve studio albums, four live albums, a box set, fourteen music videos, two extended plays and sixteen singles. Four of the band\u2019s studio albums have received Gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy nominations, winning two of them; one in 2007 for the song \u201cEyes of the Insane,\u201d and another in 2008 for the song \u201cFinal Six\u201d (both, of which, were written by Hanneman and Araya, and were from 2006\u2019s Christ Illusion). Slayer also played at several music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance, Download and Ozzfest. In January 2018, the band announced they would be embarking on their farewell tour. The tour began in May 2018 and ended in November 2019 with the band officially disbanding two days after the final concert. By that point, Slayer had been active for thirty-eight years.\n\nPast Lineup:\n\nTom Araya \u2013 Vocals, Bass Guitar (1981 \u2013 2019)\n\nKerry King \u2013 Guitars (1981 \u2013 2019)\n\nJeff Hanneman \u2013 Guitars (1981 \u2013 2013)\n\nDave Lombardo \u2013 Drums (1981 \u2013 1986, 1987 \u2013 1992, 2001 \u2013 2013)\n\nPaul Bostaph \u2013 Drums (1992 \u2013 1996, 1997 \u2013 2001, 2013 \u2013 2019)\n\nGary Holt \u2013 Guitars (2013 \u2013 2019; touring musician 2011 \u2013 2013)\n\nJon Dette \u2013 Drums (1996 \u2013 1997; touring musician 2013)\n\nTony Scaglione \u2013 Drums (touring musician 1986-1987)\n\nPat O\u2019Brien \u2013 Guitars (touring musician 2011)\n\nPhil Demmel \u2013 Guitars (touring musician 2018)"}, {"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Nofx", "page_content": "About NOFX\n\nTake the melody of The Descendents, some of Bad Religion\u2019s political sense, add a handful of pills and there\u2019s NOFX.\n\nScrewing up since 1983, the Californian group is one of the most influential bands in the history of punk rock.
