{"Adam Collis appeared in The Fault in Our Stars.": [{"url": "https://www.vulture.com/2022/01/the-fault-in-our-stars-anniversary.html", "page_content": "Photo: Twentieth Century Fox\n\nJanuary, 2012: Mission: Impossible \u2014 Ghost Protocol reigned at the box office, a new show called Girls premiered on HBO, Lana Del Rey told us we were Born to Die \u2026 and a young-adult novel about two kids with cancer falling in love became a massive sensation. The sixth book from John Green, The Fault in Our Stars, debuted January 10 at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list, where it would stay for months. Within the year, there\u2019d be special editions, nearly a million copies printed, and the announcement of a highly anticipated movie adaptation, not to mention a fan base of readers larger and more passionate than the book world had seen since perhaps Twilight.\n\nA decade after its release, the success of TFIOS seems obvious. Of course a YA romance about star-crossed teens would do well! Of course the endlessly quotable, social-media-savvy John Green would become a celebrity! Of course Hollywood would green-light a movie based on the book three weeks after its debut! But back at the start of 2012, the \u201csick teen\u201d genre barely existed, Green was just a decently popular author known best for his vlogs, and theaters were filled with movies about supernatural kids, not super-unlucky ones. TFIOS wasn\u2019t a guaranteed hit \u2014 far from it.\n\nYet thanks to some clever marketing and stellar reviews, a hit it became, and the world hasn\u2019t been the same since. In celebration of the book\u2019s tenth anniversary, here are the biggest effects that TFIOS has had on our lives a decade out.\n\nThe Rise of the \u201cSick Teens in Love\u201d Genre\n\nAs you may recall, The Fault in Our Stars tells the story of Hazel and Gus, two high-schoolers with cancer who embark on a star-crossed romance. It wasn\u2019t the first book to portray high-schoolers dealing with illness while pursuing love (see A Time to Die, Too Young to Die, even the Judy Blume scoliosis classic Deenie). But most of those works came out decades earlier. The enormous success of Green\u2019s book led to a renewed interest in the genre. From Five Feet Apart, a romance novel featuring teens with cystic fibrosis, to Everything, Everything, Nicola Yoon\u2019s best seller about a lovestruck girl suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, to Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, a critics\u2019 darling with a plot summarized by its title, both Hollywood and the young-adult publishing industry have been awash in these stories ever since TFIOS\u2019 debut, and audiences have responded in droves at the bookstore and the box office.\n\nThe Rise of Shailene Woodley\n\nAt the beginning of 2012, Woodley was still starring on The Secret Life of the American Teenager but beginning to emerge as a legitimate talent thanks to a Golden Globe\u2013nominated performance in 2011\u2019s The Descendants. The moment she was cast as Hazel in the film adaptation of The Fault in Our Stars, however, her star rose drastically, and her resulting performance earned a wave of rave reviews that jump-started an adult career that\u2019s still going strong today.\n\nThe Rise of John Green\n\nLike Woodley, Green became a true celebrity thanks to The Fault in Our Stars, albeit in quite a different way. Prior to the book\u2019s release, the author was well-known in two worlds: young-adult fiction because of the success of his previous novels like Looking for Alaska and YouTube because of his popular VlogBrothers channel with his brother, Hank. After TFIOS came out, though, Green became the rare writer (alongside other YA heavyweights like J.K. Rowling and Judy Blume) to become a household name, thanks in large part to his savvy social-media presence and genuine enthusiasm for all things pop culture.\n\nThe Rise of the Manic Pixie Dream Boy\n\nAlthough the \u201cmanic pixie dream girl\u201d has been a widely known stock character since the mid-aughts, there were few notable examples of her male version until The Fault in Our Stars introduced Augustus Waters. Quirky, thoughtful, ultraliterate, and hot (duh), Gus is pure teen fantasy: a quote-giving, floppy-haired Tumblr mood board come to life. And once audiences were introduced to Ansel Elgort in the movie version, the \u201cmanic pixie dream boy\u201d fully took hold, both in fiction (i.e., every Cole Sprouse character) and in real life (Harry Styles, Pete Davidson, Machine Gun Kelly \u2026 the list goes on). Even Jack Dawson has been recategorized as a MPDB before his time.\n\nThe Rise of Adults Proudly Loving YA\n\nTo be clear, The Fault in Our Stars is far, far from the first novel aimed at teens to capture adults\u2019 hearts. From Speak to The Book Thief to Ready Player One, the YA world has long been filled with works that appeal to readers of all ages, and it\u2019s nonsensical that there\u2019s ever been a stigma against grown-ups loving the genre. Yet unfortunately, that shaming was alive and well during the early 2010s. Still, when TFIOS came out, millions of adult readers found themselves obsessing over Green\u2019s novel and connecting deeply to its adolescent protagonists. The belated communal realization that YA books could be as smart, well-developed, and captivating as any others led to a surge in the genre\u2019s popularity, and while the stigma hasn\u2019t disappeared completely, it\u2019s certainly become far less controversial for a 40-year-old to be caught reading Sarah Dessen or Angie Thomas on the subway.\n\nThe Rise of Charli XCX\n\nYes, the rise of Charli XCX and her ultrahit \u201cBoom Clap\u201d can technically be attributed to TFIOS\u2019 release, as the song appeared on the film\u2019s soundtrack. With the ridiculously catchy track, XCX went from an up-and-coming talent to a serious star \u2014 and the rest of us were stuck with \u201cthe beat goes on and on and on\u201d in our heads for years to come.\n\nThe Rise of Everyone and Their Mother Getting a Quote Tattoo\n\n\u201cMy thoughts are stars I cannot fathom into constellations.\u201d \u201cI fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once.\u201d \u201cSome infinities are bigger than other infinities.\u201d With so many memorable lines, TFIOS inspired an ungodly number of quote tattoos after the releases of both the book and film. Whether every person who got one back then still feels as strongly about the decision today is unknown, but hopefully their clouds and infinity signs still look cool, at least. Okay? Okay."}, {"url": "https://bookanalysis.com/john-green/the-fault-in-our-stars/themes-analysis/", "page_content": "\u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 uses human-relatable themes to tell the story of its primary characters, Hazel and Augustus. Though the novel follows a tragic story, it shows the happy-sad relationship between the primary characters. The story\u2019s focus on the weaknesses and struggles of its characters made it become a popular attraction for teenagers and young adults.\n\n\n\n\n\nThemes\n\nLove and Friendship\n\nLove and friendship are the primary themes of \u2018The Fault in Our Stars.\u2019 Throughout the novel, John Green showed how Hazel and Augustus sailed through their love for each other. The story focused on its primary character\u2019s relationship and showed how it slowly progressed from mutual friendship to love.\n\nOn meeting Augustus, Hazel became attracted to him, and soon, she shared her most prized possession with him. On introducing him to \u2018An Imperial Affliction,\u2019 their relationship blossoms, and after they go to Amsterdam to meet Peter Van Houten, Hazel realizes she has fallen for Augustus. After professing their love for each other, Augustus reveals that his cancer is back. Hazel begins to navigate through the experience of seeing the person she loves fade from existence.\n\nThe novel shows how powerful friendships get. Isaac and Augustus had a strong bond that lived beyond Augustus\u2019s death; this showed the value of their relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nPain and Suffering\n\nThough the novel showed moments of happiness and love in its characters\u2019 lives, it focused more on their reality, pain, and suffering. As a novel that narrates the struggle of living with cancer, the story of \u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 perfectly portrays the suffering associated with cancer.\n\nThe novel\u2019s attention to the reality of cancer made it an extremely relatable book. After Hazel met Augustus, she realized that she could not escape her life of suffering. On meeting Peter Van Houten, she got forced to confront her reality as Van Houten told her that her ailment was nothing but an effect of evolution; this made her realize that she could never escape the pain. She had to watch Augustus gradually become a shadow of himself; this ate away at her, and when he died, she felt trapped in a cage of her pain and suffering.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentity\n\nIn \u2018The Fault in Our Stars,\u2019 Hazel and Augustus tried to navigate a life of pain and suffering while simultaneously discovering their feelings for each other. Augustus was a person who believed that leaving a mark in life was crucial. However, Hazel argued otherwise, stating that the legacy left behind by great people will turn into nothing but scars. The novel showed how Hazel, Isaac, Augustus, and other teenagers struggled to find their identity in a world of cancer and pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife and Death\n\nDeath is a primary theme in \u2018The Fault in Our Stars.\u2019 Though Hazel tried to show her strength amid suffering, she admitted that her death would bring undiluted pain to her parents and those around her. Seeing herself as a time grenade, she desperately tried to protect her family from the future impact of her death. With her life getting shorter and shorter, Hazel tried to resist falling in love with Augustus because she feared that death would only hurt him more. After Augustus revealed that he was dying from cancer, Hazel began to wish that her life was a bit different. The pain of watching Augustus die tormented her.\n\n\n\n\n\nComing of Age\n\nOne thing the novel talks about is maturity. The loss of innocence became a crucial turning point in Hazel and Augustus\u2019s lives as they matured into adulthood. They realized that their lives would circle cancer, pain, and death.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Key Moments\n\nHazel\u2019s doctor and mother advise her to attend a support group. On joining the support group, Hazel meets Augustus, a seventeen-year-old boy who had his right leg removed due to Osteosarcoma. Hazel and Augustus become friends. They exchange their favorite novels. Hazel gives him \u2018An Imperial Affliction,\u2019 and she collects \u2018The Prince of Dawn.\u2019 Augustus gets frustrated by An Imperial Affliction\u2019s ending but learns from Hazel that Peter Van Houten, its author, has moved to Amsterdam. Isaac, Augustus\u2019s friend, gets dumped by his girlfriend, Monica. Augustus reveals to Hazel that he has tracked Peter Van Houten\u2019s assistant, Lidewiji Vliegenthart, and has begun an exchange of emails with Van Houten. Hazel and Augustus start exchanging emails with Van Houten, and finally, they get invited to Amsterdam. Augustus uses his genie wish to get tickets for Hazel, himself, and her mother to see Van Houten. Hazel meets Van Houten but discovers he is a mean alcoholic. He refuses to answer her question, and in a fit of rage, she storms out of his house. Van Houten\u2019s assistant takes Hazel and Augustus to Anne Frank\u2019s house. Hazel and Augustus kiss for the first time. Hazel and Augustus lose their virginity to each other. Augustus reveals that his cancer had returned and spread throughout his body. On returning home, Augustus\u2019s health deteriorates, and he dies. Van Houten tries to apologize to Hazel at Augustus\u2019s funeral, but she rejects his apology. Van Houten\u2019s assistant tells Hazel of the letters Augustus had sent to Van Houten, and on reading one, she discovers he wrote an obituary for her.\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle, Tone, and Figurative Language\n\n\u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 employs a sad but vibrant tone but the melancholy switches when Hazels falls in love with Augustus and becomes a happy tone. Hazel\u2019s straightforwardness made the story progress rapidly as she served as the narrator from a first-person\u2019s perspective.\n\nThe story uses similes, metaphors, personifications, and allusions to create a delicately interesting word structure. Metaphors like Augustus\u2019s use of cigarettes created an ironic portrayal of the story\u2019s narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis of Symbols\n\nAn Imperial Affliction\n\nThe book \u2018An Imperial Affliction\u2019 has many metaphorical reflections on Hazel\u2019s life. She admitted to the book being like a Bible for her because it was one of the few novels that understood what it felt like to be dying. Hazel stated that Peter Van Houten was a writer who understood death. After reading the book numerously, Hazel became addicted to the fate of the story\u2019s characters; this makes her travel to Amsterdam in search of answers. However, on reaching Amsterdam, she got hit by reality as she discovered that Van Houten had no suitable answer to her questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCigarettes\n\nIn the novel, Augustus kept a cigarette pack. When asked about why he had a cigarette placed in his mouth, he stated that it was a representation of trying to prove that one had power over a force of evil. The cigarette symbolizes the belief that something can only harm a person when they let it hurt them.\n\n\n\n\n\nOxygen Tank\n\nThroughout the novel, Hazel always uses an oxygen tank. The tank represents the blockade that stood between life and death for Hazel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat are the primary themes of The Fault in Our Stars? \u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 implements many themes synonymous with teenagers; this includes themes of coming of age, love, and identity. The novel exploited the concept of pain in its characters\u2019 lives. What happens to Isaac in The Fault in Our Stars? Isaac is August\u2019s friend who had eye cancer. When Isaac got scheduled to undergo surgery, he and Monica broke up. The surgery was successful, but he lost his eye and became blind. Does Hazel die in the Fault in Our Stars? Though the novel did not show whether Hazel died or not, John Green revealed that she died one year after Augustus\u2019s death. What do Augustus\u2019s cigarettes represent? When Hazel got angry at Augustus for putting a cigarette in his mouth, he told her that the cigarette was a metaphor. He explained that having the cigarette in his mouth without smoking gave him power over death."}, {"url": "https://www.looper.com/843829/the-ending-of-the-fault-in-our-stars-explained/", "page_content": "Prior to meeting Gus, Hazel is isolated in her world. She has no close friends and keeps a distance from her parents. She wants to minimalize the damage her death will cause, evidenced in her \"grenade\" monologue.

But the book ends abruptly in the middle of a sentence and provides little resolution. Many of Hazel's lingering questions about the story revolve around the supporting characters, wondering how they move on after the girl's death.\n\nHazel's obsession with the novel can be considered a metaphor for her lack of control. She's not only a teenager with limited freedoms, but also has an incurable disease \u2014 traits she and Anna share. Rereading the novel is one of the few things she can control. Where \"An Imperial Affliction\" ends both tragically and vaguely, Hazel hopes for a different ending for herself. She refuses to live happily in the present and to think of her life as something of joy.\n\nGus develops many of these obsessions since he's scared of oblivion, but he has the means to confront the uncertainty of \"An Imperial Affliction\" head-on: his Make-A-Wish.\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, please contact the Crisis Text Line by texting HOME to 741741, call the National Alliance on Mental Illness helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264), or visit the National Institute of Mental Health website."}, {"url": "https://bookanalysis.com/john-green/the-fault-in-our-stars/summary/", "page_content": "\u2018The Fault in Our Stars\u2019 by John Green tells the story of Hazel, a young sixteen-year-old girl who struggles with thyroid cancer.

Because of her cancer, she uses a portable oxygen tank to breathe properly. In one of the meetings she catches the eye of a teenage boy, and through the course of the meeting she learns the boy\u2019s name is Augustus Waters. He's there to support their mutual friend, Isaac. Isaac had a tumor in one eye that he had removed, and now he has to have his other eye taken out as well. After the meeting ends, Augustus approaches Hazel and tells her she looks like Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta. He invites Hazel to his house to watch the movie, and while hanging out, the two discuss their experiences with cancer. Hazel reveals she has thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Augustus had osteosarcoma, but he is now cancer free after having his leg amputated. Before Augustus takes Hazel home, they agree to read one another\u2019s favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction.\n\nHazel explains the magnificence of An Imperial Affliction: It is a novel about a girl named Anna who has cancer, and it's the only account she's read of living with cancer that matches her experience. She describes how the novel maddeningly ends midsentence, denying the reader closure about the fate of the novel\u2019s characters. She speculates about the novel\u2019s mysterious author, Peter Van Houten, who fled to Amsterdam after the novel was published and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.\n\nA week after Hazel and Augustus discuss the literary meaning of An Imperial Affliction, Augustus miraculously reveals he tracked down Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and through her he's managed to start an email correspondence with the reclusive author. He shares Van Houten's letter with Hazel, and she devises a list of questions to send Van Houten, hoping to clear up the novel\u2019s ambiguous conclusion. Hazel is most concerned with the fate of Anna\u2019s mother. She figures that if Anna\u2019s mother survives her daughter\u2019s death, then her own parents will be alright after Hazel dies. Van Houten eventually replies, saying he could only answer Hazel\u2019s questions in person. He invites her to stop by if she is ever in Amsterdam.\n\nShortly after Augustus invites Hazel on a picnic. It turns out he's planned an elaborate Dutch-themed picnic where he reveals that a charitable foundation that grants the wishes of kids with cancer has agreed to grant his: he's taking the two of them to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten. She is thrilled, but when he touches her face she feels hesitant for some reason. Over time she realizes that she likes him a lot, but she knows she'll hurt him when she dies. She compares herself to a grenade.\n\nIn the midst of her struggle over what to do about Augustus, Hazel suffers a serious episode in which her lungs fill with fluid and she goes to the ICU. When she is released after a period of days, she learns that Augustus never left the hospital\u2019s waiting room. He delivers Hazel another letter from Van Houten, this one more personal and more cryptic than the last. After reading the letter, Hazel is more determined than ever to go to Amsterdam. There is a problem though: Her parents and her team of doctors don\u2019t think Hazel is strong enough to travel. The situation seems hopeless until one of the physicians most familiar with her case, Dr. Maria, convinces Hazel\u2019s parents that Hazel must travel because she needs to live her life.\n\nThe plans are made for Augustus, Hazel, and Hazel's mother to go to Amsterdam, but when Hazel and Augustus meet Van Houten they find that, instead of a prolific genius, he is a mean-spirited drunk who claims he cannot answer any of Hazel\u2019s questions. The two leave Van Houten\u2019s in utter disappointment, and accompanied by Lidewij, who feels horrified by Van Houten's behavior, they tour Anne Frank\u2019s house. At the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel share a romantic kiss, to the applause of spectators. They head back to the hotel where they make love for the first and only time. The following day, Augustus confesses that while Hazel was in the ICU he had a body scan which revealed his cancer has returned and spread everywhere. They return to Indianapolis, and Hazel realizes Augustus is now the grenade. As his condition worsens he is less prone to his typical charm and confidence. He becomes vulnerable and scared, but is still a beautiful boy in Hazel\u2019s mind. As this change occurs, she ceases calling him Augustus and starts referring to him as just Gus, as his parents do. Hazel recognizes that she loves him now as much as ever. Augustus\u2019s condition deteriorates quickly. In his final days Augustus arranges a prefuneral for himself, and Isaac and Hazel give eulogies. Hazel steals a line from Van Houten about larger and smaller infinities. She says how much she loves Augustus, and that she would not trade their short time together for anything in the world.\n\nAugustus dies eight days later. Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. Van Houten explains that he and Gus maintained correspondence and that Augustus demanded Van Houten make up for ruining the trip to Amsterdam by coming to his funeral to see Hazel. Van Houten abstractly reveals the fate of Anna\u2019s mother, but Hazel is not interested. A few days later Isaac informs Hazel that Augustus was writing something for her. He had hinted about writing a sequel to An Imperial Affliction for her, and as Hazel scrambles to locate the pages she encounters Van Houten once more. He drunkenly reveals that Anna was the name of his daughter. She died of cancer when she was eight, and An Imperial Affliction was his literary attempt at reconciling himself with her death. Hazel tells Van Houten to sober up and write another book.\n\nEventually Hazel learns that Augustus sent the pages to Van Houten because he wanted Van Houten to use the pages to compose a well-written eulogy about Hazel. Lidewij forces Van Houten to read the pages and sends them straight off to Hazel. The novel concludes with Hazel reading Augustus\u2019s words. He says getting hurt in this world is inevitable, but we do get to choose who we allow to hurt us, and that he his happy with his choice. He hopes she likes her choice too. The final words of the novel come from Hazel, who says she does."}], "Adam Collis appeared in The Social Network.": [{"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/look-inside-life-people-the-social-network-ten-years-later-2020-10", "page_content": "It's been 10 years since actor Jesse Eisenberg appeared on movie screens as Mark Zuckerberg in a dramatized version of Facebook's founding story in the movie \"The Social Network.\"\n\nJesse Eisenberg attends the 'The Social Network' premiere during the 5th Rome International Film Festival on November 1, 2010 in Rome, Italy.

Join us all throughout the week as we celebrate and examine the man, the myth, and his impeccable body of work.\n\nIn 2017, Mark Zuckerberg returned to Harvard for a victory lap that most people can only dream of. Twelve years after the Facebook CEO dropped out of school to run what would become the largest online social network in the world, the elite Ivy League would give him an honorary degree. Facebook celebrated the event as an opportunity to showcase the company\u2019s history and display a more personal side of its CEO, organizing a few public broadcasts ahead of the speech. One of those included a visit to Kirkland House H33, the room where it all started.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that we\u2019ve been back in this dorm since I left,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a Facebook Live video that he was filming from his smartphone. With his college sweetheart Priscilla Chan in tow, he directed viewers toward his old desk, and the rooms where his Facebook cofounders (and then-roommates) Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes worked and slept. After some reminiscing about tiny bed sizes and dining hall cuisine, he addressed an incident that has, over the span of the past decade, become millennial folklore.\n\n\u201cOne weekend I wanted to build this prank website, FaceMash,\u201d he said with his signature indecipherable smile. \u201cI basically sat here for, like, three days straight, and just coded this thing. And it was a prank. It was kind of funny but also a little bit in poor taste.\u201d He summarized how it spread quickly, froze his laptop, and caused Harvard officials to turn off the entire dorm\u2019s internet connection. \u201cThat was probably one of my more memorable moments from Kirkland House, just sitting here, and, like, I\u2019m trying to fix this, Dustin\u2019s trying to do his computer-science problem set, Chris is trying to write some paper for social studies or whatever he\u2019s studying, and all the sudden the internet goes dark.\u201d\n\nLive from my old dorm room at Harvard. Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday, May 23, 2017\n\nAs Zuckerberg tells it, the story of FaceMash was nothing more than an innocent college gag that ended in a night of forced unproductivity. But chances are, most people watching that day remember it differently, as the riveting sequence of events at the start of a major Hollywood blockbuster called The Social Network. After conquering the business world, Zuckerberg had finally earned the approval of the elite institution he\u2019d once antagonized. But sitting at his old dorm room desk years later, it seemed his one remaining challenge was to reclaim his past.\n\nIn the decade since The Social Network\u2019s release, Facebook has become so omnipresent and unregulated that no misstep\u2014whether related to privacy, anti-trust laws, geopolitics, or genocide\u2014has managed to etch away at its dominance. Because Zuckerberg holds control of somewhere around 60 percent of Facebook\u2019s voting shares, he alone can determine what people see when they log on to Facebook and Instagram, what privacy settings they have access to, and the difference between violent and incendiary speech. As Chris Hughes, that same cofounder he roomed with back at Harvard, wrote in a 2019 New York Times op-ed, \u201cMark\u2019s influence is staggering, far beyond that of anyone else in the private sector or in government.\u201d\n\nIn tandem with that growing influence, Zuckerberg\u2019s public persona is now so heavily managed that you\u2019d have a better time deciphering the feelings of the AI assistant he once built to run his house than determining what he\u2019s really thinking. Maybe that\u2019s why Aaron Sorkin\u2019s version of the ambitious boy hacker still clings to the public\u2019s imagination. The more Zuckerberg has been shrouded in corporate armor, the more people have turned to his silver-screen depiction for clues.\n\nHow exactly did a Hollywood film beat the most powerful unelected man in America at telling his own origin story? It all begins with an enterprising science-fiction writer with a penchant for, uh, literary embellishment.\n\n\n\nThe Book\n\nBefore Ben Mezrich signed what was reportedly a million-dollar-plus book deal to write The Accidental Billionaires: The Founding of Facebook, a Tale of Sex, Money, Genius, and Betrayal, his reporting credentials had been dragged through the mud. His previous book, Bringing Down the House, about a troupe of MIT students who used advanced blackjack techniques to win millions of dollars in Vegas, was the first \u201ctrue\u201d story he\u2019d ever written, and it showed. Not long after it came out in 2002, its main characters debunked its most lurid details: They did not collaborate with strippers to cash their chips, the underground Chinatown casino where they supposedly practiced didn\u2019t exist, and a private detective with \u201cnarrow ice-blue eyes\u201d never beat them up in a casino bathroom. Still, those flourishes helped Mezrich more than they hurt him. The book sold over 1 million copies, and eventually became a Kevin Spacey\u2013produced heist film called 21.\n\nWith Accidental Billionaires, it was more of the same. The book\u2019s first cover advertised a tale of college debauchery with a slinky red bra and broken martini glass. Its narrative goes like this: Zuckerberg is a dorky nobody who, like everyone else at Harvard, is determined to join one of the school\u2019s elite social clubs. (Mezrich, a Harvard graduate himself, emphasizes in vivid, knowing detail just how important this kind of membership is to meeting women and getting laid.) Scorned by a mystery woman one evening, Zuckerberg gets drunk in his dorm room and revenge-codes a campus-specific Hot or Not site.\n\nThat part, at least, was a real-life incident that was documented in the LiveJournal updates Zuckerberg used to narrate his creation of the burgeoning social media tool: \u201cJessica A\u2014 is a bitch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI need to think of something to take my mind off her. I need to think of something to occupy my mind. Easy enough, now I just need an idea.\u201d Another entry: \u201cI\u2019m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it\u2019s not even 10 p.m. and it\u2019s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive.\u201d Later: \u201cYea, it\u2019s on. I\u2019m not exactly sure how the farm animals are going to fit into this whole thing (you can\u2019t really ever be sure with farm animals . . .), but I like the idea of comparing two people together.\u201d\n\nSign up for the The Ringer Newsletter Thanks for signing up!

Subscribe\n\nFaceMash goes viral and inspires Zuckerberg to make something bigger. Meanwhile, two pedigreed rowers named Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss ask him to help with their own campus social network. He leads them on, while partnering with his best friend, Eduardo Saverin, to create a fast-growing competing product. Eventually, Sean Parker, the cofounder of Napster, swoops in whispering sweet nothings of VC funding in Zuckerberg\u2019s ear. The two hatch a scheme to push Saverin out of the company. (Parker\u2019s affinity for women and parties, meanwhile, seals his fate.) Zuckerberg emerges alone atop the fastest growing social network in the world.\n\nA year before the book came out, speculation about its sourcing was rampant. Gawker leaked Mezrich\u2019s initial proposal, noting that the story leaned heavily on Saverin\u2019s account and that \u201cmany facts seem off.\u201d In particular, the blog questioned a bizarre scene in which one of the founders of Sun Microsystems invites Zuckerberg to eat koala on his yacht. When The New York Times later obtained an early galley, it highlighted other \u201cpossible fabrications,\u201d including a moment where Zuckerberg leaves a San Francisco party with a Victoria\u2019s Secret model. (At that point, Zuckerberg was already dating his now-wife, Chan.) When the Times reached out to the book\u2019s publisher, a publicist shrugged off concerns of veracity, saying: \u201cThis is not reportage. It is big, juicy fun.\u201d\n\nEven with Gawker Media\u2019s steady drumbeat of criticism and the occasional privacy flare-up, Zuckerberg still enjoyed a relatively peaceful, even flattering relationship with the media. His interviews with Wired and Techcrunch were never hostile, and mostly portrayed him as a young, awkward, and very, very smart entrepreneur. In the business press, he was genuinely admired for building a company that was well on its way to an IPO at the tender age of 25. Shortly after the movie came out, his blank expression even appeared on the cover of Time magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d issue\u2014something that now seems unthinkable. \u201cThe Social Network is a rich, dramatic portrait of a furious, socially handicapped genius who spits corrosive monologues in a monotone to hide his inner pain,\u201d the story\u2019s author, Lev Grossman, wrote. \u201cThis character bears almost no resemblance to the actual Mark Zuckerberg. The reality is much more complicated.\u201d\n\nThe Movie\n\nWhen The Social Network hit theaters in 2010, Facebook was the tech industry\u2019s golden goose egg, and Zuckerberg its attentive countryman in menswear basics. It was the most visited website in the United States. Its hacker-friendly slogan \u201cMove Fast and Break Things,\u201d earned it a reputation in the Valley as a bold, forward-thinking innovator that wasn\u2019t afraid to take risks. And, thanks in part to the growth of the company\u2019s advertising operations, it would earn about $2 billion in revenue that year.\n\nMost importantly, the public had come to see Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg as one and the same. When the website launched in 2004, the phrase \u201cA Mark Zuckerberg Production\u201d was stamped at the bottom of every single page. In subsequent years, the CEO was frequently quoted in The Harvard Crimson and other Ivy League newspapers discussing new features. At one point, he even returned to his alma mater to recruit people to work there. As his cabal of engineers rolled out new features from their raucous Palo Alto incubator, Mark led by example, tagging himself in photos and feverishly \u201cliking\u201d things. I was in the final class of students who received their college emails and joined Facebook, before it was opened up to the public, and seeing a tech CEO use social media at all felt intimate, novel. I recall thinking of Zuckerberg as a kind of millennial icon who was using his superior coding skills to enhance our social lives. A somewhat bland one, but an icon nonetheless.\n\nWhatever goodwill Zuckerberg had earned by making a fun platform ran thinner as Facebook pushed to expand. In 2006, the company premiered \u201cNews Feed\u201d\u2014the now-standard homepage that summarizes the profile changes, posts, birthdays, and upcoming events of everyone in a user\u2019s social network\u2014and faced its first real privacy scandal. People complained the update made it too easy for other people to track their individual activities. A \u201cStudents Against Facebook News Feed\u201d group was started, and gained over 100,000 members in a day. TV stations and protestors lined up on the street outside of the company\u2019s Palo Alto office. Zuckerberg responded to the fervor in a Facebook post titled \u201cCalm Down. Breathe. We Hear You.\u201d \u201cStalking isn\u2019t cool, but being able to know what\u2019s going on in your friends\u2019 lives is,\u201d he wrote with frat boy confidence, promising to add privacy tools.\n\nBut after the dust settled from that incident, little versions of the News Feed saga kept happening again and again and again. Journalists soon began to posit that Facebook\u2019s cavalier privacy efforts were not a result of inexperience, but of its leader\u2019s stubborn indifference to criticism and disdain for users. In May of 2010, Nicholas Carlson unearthed an instant message exchange from Zuckerberg\u2019s Harvard days in which the CEO offers an unnamed friend access to his fellow classmates\u2019 information. \u201cI have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat? How\u2019d you manage that one,\u201d the anonymous recipient of these messages responded. \u201cPeople just submitted it,\u201d Zuckerberg concluded. \u201cI don\u2019t know why. They \u2018trust me.\u2019 Dumb fucks.\u201d In a mostly flattering New Yorker profile that Facebook timed to come out ahead of The Social Network\u2019s release, Zuckerberg said he regretted these messages, but they nonetheless seemed to confirm an increasingly frustrated public\u2019s suspicions that, no matter how many public pledges Zuckerberg made to protect user data, he was sitting in a giant mansion somewhere, snickering at all the chumps who\u2019d trusted him.\n\nThe team entrusted with making The Social Network would only build off that impression. Once Gawker leaked Mezrich\u2019s proposal, the film adaptation was set in motion. Aaron Sorkin, then famous for his loquacious political drama The West Wing, signed on to write the script, and David Fincher, who\u2019d earned a reputation for composing intellectual thrillers like Fight Club and Zodiac, would direct. Together, they cast a trio of hot 20-something actors: Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, Andrew Garfield as Saverin, and singer Justin Timberlake as Parker. Scott Rudin, one of the film\u2019s producers, attempted to secure Facebook\u2019s cooperation, but the company considered any material sourced from Accidental Billionaires to be fiction. In the end, the team felt it had enough public records to stick with the Mezrich treatment anyway. Sorkin said he nevertheless took \u201cextra care\u201d knowing his subjects were real people. \u201cYou feel a special responsibility, knowing what a loud sound a Hollywood movie makes,\u201d he later told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThough Sorkin\u2019s script contains no koala entr\u00e9es, the moments in which he chose to exercise his creative liberties were some of the most memorable. Specifically when he imagines a breakup between Zuckerberg and the woman who inspired FaceMash in the first few minutes of the movie. In the subsequent drunken code-a-thon that follows, Sorkin embellishes Zuckerberg\u2019s LiveJournal rant by adding a few more cruel lines about the fictitious ex\u2019s last name and bra size. Tonally, his version wasn\u2019t so different from Zuckerberg\u2019s original entries, or even your average Reddit post. But\u2014combined with the made-up breakup and the fact that Chan was completely left out of the film\u2014Sorkin\u2019s additions made Zuckerberg seem extra callous. In the movie\u2019s closing scene, after the Facebook creator has betrayed his collaborators and claimed his place atop the social totem pole, he returns to that same ex\u2019s Facebook profile, refreshing it over and over again to see whether she has accepted his friend request. As history would prove, it was just the right amount of real and fake to burrow deep into people\u2019s brains as Facebook canon.\n\nThe Reception\n\nAs emails from the 2014 Sony hack showed, Zuckerberg had tried and failed to stop the film from being made. So ahead of its release, Facebook\u2019s in-house PR agency, Outcast, devised a strategy to avoid slamming the film or attacking its creators. Instead, they would offer a counternarrative, in The New Yorker and, with help from cofounder Chris Hughes, in The New York Times. When NPR\u2019s Guy Raz asked about the film in 2010, Zuckerberg called it \u201cfiction.\u201d\n\nInternally, Facebook tried to embrace the film. On opening weekend, it held an all-staff showing at Century Cinema 16 in Mountain View (which, coincidentally, was also where I saw Independence Day, Jack, and many other classics as a kid). \u201cWe had some fun with it,\u201d Mark Zuckerberg said during a Q&A years later, after it became clear the movie would not go away. \u201cI mean we knew that everyone who works at Facebook was going to want to see it anyway, because how often does someone make a major movie about your company?\u201d Zuckerberg added that, for a while after the showing, Facebook employees would make fun of him by mixing appletinis in the office\u2014a reference to the scene in the movie where his character first meets Parker and consumes several of the cocktails.\n\nBut to viewers who didn\u2019t work at Facebook, The Social Network depicted a more sinister version of the 20-something to whom millions of users had entrusted their photos, birthdays, and interests. A version who trampled over his fellow students\u2019 security in the name of a tasteless prank, who willingly pushed his friends and classmates out of the way to get what he wanted, and who was far less interested in Facebook\u2019s stated mission of \u201cconnecting people\u201d than he was in consolidating power. As Times reviewer Manohla Dargis put it:\n\nThe price of that ambition, at least as dramatized here, is borne by those around Mark, who remains a strategic cipher throughout: a Facebook page without a profile photo. Charmless and awkward in groups larger than one, he rarely breaks into a smile and, if memory serves, never says thank you. He seems wary at some moments, coolly calculating at others: When his eyes haven\u2019t gone dead, you can see him working all the angles.\n\nHis tech-industry peers took less precaution to separate fact from fiction. \u201cIt says something about the characters in a film, and in the valley, when the most likable characters are the lawyers,\u201d one tech worker tweeted. Another chimed, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to hate Zuck or Parker or try to become them. Or both.\u201d Tech journalist Jon Dube summarized the public sentiment most succinctly: \u201cMade Zuck look pretty bad.\u201d\n\nThe movie was an immediate hit, grossing $224.9 million worldwide. It earned eight Academy Award nominations and three actual Oscars. The Times staff apparently covered it so much that it became the subject of a Variety column. And it soon became a beloved, oft-parodied fixture in popular culture. The same month the movie premiered, a Forbes poll found that \u201c63 percent of Americans didn\u2019t trust Facebook with their personal information.\u201d\n\nThe Corporate Makeover\n\nFollowing the release of a major-motion picture that made its founder look like a socially inept hacker, the company needed to run damage control, especially given the IPO on the horizon. Privately, Zuckerberg would spend the next few years ensuring he was protected from the public eye, spending $30 million on the four homes that surrounded his Palo Alto property, building a 6-foot lava rock wall around his 700-acre estate in Kauai, and hiring a private security detail to patrol the perimeters of his properties (and, apparently, protect his trash). But publicly, he embarked on a campaign to soften his image. The day the film premiered, he went on Oprah to announce he was giving a $100 million grant to the Newark school system. A few months later, he appeared on Saturday Night Live where he and the host, Jesse Eisenberg, made awkward small talk. He got a Hungarian sheepdog named Beast and made it a Facebook page. He reduced his annual salary to $1 a year.\n\nFacebook later created an entire team to maintain Zuckerberg\u2019s Facebook profile. Some of them deleted harassing comments on the threads he posted, others followed him around and took professional photos as he went for a run or hung out with his family. His annual New Year\u2019s resolutions evolved from simple stuff like \u201cwear a tie everyday\u201d in 2009, to symbolic endeavors like \u201cmeet a person from every U.S. state\u201d in 2017. His staff even went so far as to quietly delete all his old Facebook messenger conversations. Occasional telling tidbits\u2014like Zuckerberg\u2019s affinity for the game Risk\u2014would filter through the press, buttressing the myth of the domineering nerd, but outwardly he maintained the polished aura of a CEO, with more production value and much, much less personality.\n\nHe also made a point to improve his public speaking. The old Mark Zuckerberg preferred to let his employees run meetings while occasionally yelling the word \u201cDomination!\u201d into the ether. But in late 2014, the new Zuck 2.0 would stream live \u201cTown Halls\u201d from his Facebook page, answering questions on a range of topics from employees and users. During the very first session at the company\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters, the mic was handed to a woman named Lori who had flown in from Povo, Utah, to repeat a question she had posted on one of the CEO\u2019s threads. \u201cI\u2019m a huge movie fan, and one of my top-10 favorite movies is The Social Network, and my question has always been to you: How accurate is the story compared to the real-life story of Facebook\u2019s beginnings?\u201d\n\nZuckerberg laughed nervously. \u201cWow, I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time thinking about that movie in a while,\u201d he said, \u201cI kinda blocked that one out.\u201d He then went on to make several points. That, one, his life was far less interesting than the movie made it out to be: \u201cThe reality is that writing a code and then building a product and then building a company actually is not a glamorous enough thing to make a movie about, so you can imagine that a lot of the stuff they probably had to embellish and make up. Because if they were really making a movie, it would\u2019ve been of me sitting at a computer and coding for two hours straight, which probably would\u2019ve just not been that good of a movie. And these guys, I think, want to win awards and sell tickets. So that\u2019s kind of where they went with it.\u201d Two, that he had never met the people who\u2019d made the movie about his life, aside from his brief encounter with Eisenberg: \u201cI think he was a little afraid to meet me, after his portrayal, but I tried to be nice.\u201d Three, the premise of the movie\u2014that Zuckerberg was motivated to make Facebook so he could meet girls\u2014was messed up. \u201cThey just kind of made up a bunch of stuff that I found kind of hurtful.\u201d And four, he\u2019d begun dating Chan before he even started Facebook. (This is technically true. The two met in the bathroom line of the preemptive \u201cgoing-away party\u201d his Jewish frat threw him after he\u2019d met with Harvard\u2019s administrative board about the FaceMash incident.) In sum: \u201cI think the real story is just, you know, a lot of hard work.\u201d\n\nThe Legacy\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s motivations for maintaining an air-tight public persona have shifted over the years, away from his Social Network portrayal and toward a steady stream of scandals. After Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, and accusations of social media bubbles and Russian interference soared, Zuckerberg embarked on a public relations tour of roughly 30 states with a professional photographer in tow. He pet a service dog in Montana, drove a tractor in Wisconsin, and watched a rodeo in Texas. Each stop warranted its own crisp Facebook post, and each update seemed more careful and apolitical than the previous. After he\u2019d finally completed the project he gave a Q&A about what he\u2019d learned, concluding, blandly, that \u201cthe biggest takeaway by far is that community, and especially local community, are much more important to people than we realize.\u201d It appeared Zuckerberg\u2019s aim was to demonstrate to users he didn\u2019t think of them as numbers, or chumps, but people\u2014even if the way Facebook operates indicated otherwise. But without any kind of political bent or spice to his messaging, the campaign felt weird, like after years hidden away behind a computer he was on a quest to learn about the human race for the very first time.\n\nThe more canned Zuckerberg has become, the more the public has turned to his silver screen depiction for answers.The Social Network is stamped into the company\u2019s DNA. As Steven Levy describes in the first chapter of Facebook: The Inside Story, Zuckerberg is asked about the movie in places as far flung as Nigeria. In 2018, The New Yorker reported that Facebook executives still refer to The Social Network resentfully as \u201cthe movie.\u201d \u201cFrom its facts to its essence to its portrayal, I think that was a very unfair picture,\u201d Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg said in the same piece. \u201cI still think it forms the basis of a lot of what people believe about Mark.\u201d Ahead of one of the most consequential presidential elections in recent history, the public continues to take stock of Facebook\u2019s negative effect on public discourse, news, and democracy. And in those terms, David Fincher\u2019s masterpiece has felt all the more relevant; spiritually, if not factually, correct. More than anything, in a 10-year vacuum of personality, the better story won."}, {"url": "https://www.insider.com/the-social-network-cast-then-now-photos", "page_content": "\"The Social Network,\" directed by David Fincher and written by Aaron Sorkin, was released on October 1, 2010.\n\nThe movie was based on Ben Mezrich's book \"The Accidental Billionaires\" and centered on how Mark Zuckerberg became the cofounder of Facebook and found himself in the middle of two lawsuits.\n\nEisenberg, who portrayed Zuckerberg, earned an Oscar nomination for his role in the film.\n\nSince then, he's portrayed Lex Luthor in the DC Extended Universe and reprised his \"Zombieland\" role for a 2019 sequel.\n\nAndrew Garfield, who played Eduardo Saverin in \"The Social Network,\" went on to portray Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the \"Amazing Spider-Man\" movies.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nTop editors give you the stories you want \u2014 delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

The short-lived series \u2013 which ran between 2012 and 2014 \u2013 covered two films, The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014).\n\nAcross the course of the two films, the series introduced a number of villains. Some became a key focus of the story, while others were merely background players, introduced for inclusion in future movies (which never materialised).\n\nBut who are the villains of The Amazing Spider-Man films?\n\nAdvertisements Advertisements\n\n______________\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012)\n\nHere are the villains of The Amazing Spider-Man\u2026\n\nDr. Curt Connors/The Lizard \u2013 Rhys Ifans\n\nImage: \u00a9Sony Pictures/Columbia Pictures/Marvel Entertainment\n\n\u201cPoor Peter Parker. No father. No mother. No uncle. You\u2019re all alone.\u201d\n\nThe primary villain of The Amazing Spider-Man is Dr. Curtis Connors \u2013 a scientist at Oscorp who is working on research involving cross-species genetics. Connors\u2019 research has the potential to help amputees regrow lost limbs \u2013 something that he himself would benefit from, having previously lost his right arm.\n\nUpon piecing together a potentially successful formula \u2013 with the help of Peter Parker \u2013 Connors experiments on himself.

This thief is arguably the most important villain on this list as he leads Peter Parker down a path towards being a hero.\n\nThe unnamed man robs a convenience store in front of Peter Parker. Parker has the opportunity to stop him, but chooses not to \u2013 even though he is powerful enough to do so.\n\nDue to Peter\u2019s inactions, the thief runs away from the store and straight into the path of Peter\u2019s uncle, Ben Parker.

Although he is credited as \u2018Man in the Shadows\u2019, this figure is Gustav Fiers, aka The Gentleman.\n\nThe Gentleman only appears briefly in the movie, in order to establish his presence as a background player in The Amazing Spider-Man movie series.\n\nNorman Osborn\n\nIn addition to the above, Norman Osborn (known in the comics as Spidey\u2019s arch enemy the Green Goblin) is mentioned in The Amazing Spider-Man.

But this obsession takes a sinister turn when Dillon acquires electric-based abilities in an accident, and he takes a path towards becoming a supervillain.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n______________\n\nNorman Osborn \u2013 Chris Cooper\n\nImage: \u00a9Sony Pictures/Columbia Pictures/Marvel Entertainment\n\n\u201cThis is not how I imagined I would die.

However, this is not something which is mentioned in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Smythe merely appears in the movie as a background character.\n\nAdvertisements Advertisements\n\nAdditional Spider-Man villains\n\nIn addition to the above villains, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 teases a couple of classic Spider-Man adversaries. These villains include Doctor Octopus and the Vulture, who are part of Oscorp\u2019s secretive \u2018Special Projects\u2019 department.\n\n______________\n\nThere are only two entries in The Amazing Spider-Man series, yet across the two films a significant number of villains are introduced into the Spider-Man movie mythology. Some of these villains are used as primary characters, while others are being lined up for an appearance in the aborted The Amazing Spider-Man 3.\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 3 never came to pass, but should you wish to know more about the proposed project then take a look through my post: \u2018What happened to The Amazing Spider-Man 3?\u2019 This post will tell you what was planned for the film and why it was cancelled.\n\nAs for the villains of The Amazing Spider-Man, who is your favourite?

Not only will I tell you where he can be found in both Amazing movies, but I can also tell you who he is and what he is doing in the films.\n\nFirst up, let\u2019s recap where he can be found in each picture.\n\nAdvertisements Advertisements\n\n_______\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man (2012)\n\nImage: \u00a9Sony Pictures/Columbia Pictures/Marvel Entertainment\n\nThe Man in the Shadows makes his first appearance at the end of The Amazing Spider-Man. If you don\u2019t sit through a few of the end credits you will miss him.\n\nAfter the initial set of credits appear, a scene opens up to show Dr. Curt Connors in a prison cell. Connors has been put in the cell following his transformation into The Lizard and it is here that he receives a visitor.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAlthough Connors appears to be alone, a voice suddenly calls out from the shadows. It is here that the following exchange takes place:\n\nThe Man in the Shadows: \u201cHello doctor. Did you tell the boy?\u201d\n\nConnors: \u201cTell him what?\u201d\n\nThe Man in the Shadows: \u201cDid you tell the boy the truth about his father?\u201d\n\nConnors: \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe Man in the Shadows: \u201cWell that\u2019s very good. We\u2019ll let him be for now.\u201d\n\nConnors: \u201cYou should leave him alone.\u201d\n\nAfter this exchange there is a flash of lightning, followed by the feeling that Connors is now alone in his cell. The scene fades to black and the credits continue.\n\nThere is no explanation as to who the voice belongs to, and the character is not named during the exchange. However, in the credits, the character is listed as \u2018Man in the Shadows\u2019, with actor Michael Massee taking on the part.\n\nThe \u201cboy\u201d that is mentioned during the exchange is Peter Parker.\n\nAdvertisements Advertisements\n\n_______\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2\n\nImage: \u00a9Sony Pictures/Columbia Pictures/Marvel Entertainment\n\nWhen the \u2018Man in the Shadows\u2019 reappears it is during the final act of The Amazing Spider-Man 2. This time he visits Harry Osborn, who is locked up at Ravencroft Institute following his transformation into the Green Goblin.\n\nOnce again there is an exchange.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nHarry: \u201cYou\u2019ve made progress.\u201d\n\nThe Man in the Shadows: \u201cI\u2019ve identified several worthy candidates. Now that Spider-Man\u2019s gone, this city will never be the same.\u201d\n\nHarry: \u201cOh, I\u2019m counting on that.\u201d\n\nThe Man in the Shadows: \u201cSpeaking of progress, you\u2019re looking better.\u201d\n\nHarry: \u201cIt comes and goes. Tell me more.\u201d\n\nThe Man in the Shadows: \u201cHow many men did you have in mind?\u201d\n\nHarry: \u201cI want to keep it small. Everything you need is already at Oscorp.\u201d\n\nCut to a scene at Oscorp, and a voice-activated security system identifies the \u2018Man in the Shadows\u2019 as Mr. Fiers. Here, Fiers is seen walking past a collection of weapons, including the tentacles of Doctor Octopus, the wings of the Vulture, and a Rhino suit.\n\nThe discussion that took place between Harry and Fiers is about the formation of a supervillain group. Oscorp has been developing weapons and Fiers has an idea of who he can recruit for the team.\n\nAdvertisements Advertisements\n\n_______\n\nWho is Mr. Fiers?\n\nImage: \u00a9Marvel Comics\n\nSo, thanks to a namedrop in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, it is established that the Man in the Shadows is actually called Mr. Fiers. In Spider-Man mythology, Mr. Fiers is better known as Gustav Fiers aka The Gentleman.\n\nThe Gentleman originated in a series of Spider-Man novels, beginning with Spider-Man: The Gathering of the Sinister Six, which was published in 1999. He later reappeared in Spider-Man: Revenge of the Sinister Six and Spider-Man: Secret of the Sinister Six, before being transported across to the comics.\n\nAs you might have guessed by now, the character was a background player in the formation of the villainous Sinister Six \u2013 a team of Spider-Man\u2019s most fearsome foes.\n\nAdvertisements\n\n_______\n\nWhat is The Gentleman\u2019s role in The Amazing Spider-Man movies?\n\nImage: \u00a9Sony Pictures/Columbia Pictures/Marvel Entertainment\n\nAlthough his motivations are never truly explained in the Amazing movies, from his brief appearances as well as his exchanges with Curt Connors and Harry Osborn, The Gentleman appears to be keeping a careful watch on everything to do with Spider-Man.\n\nIn The Amazing Spider-Man it is established that The Gentleman knows Peter\u2019s secret identity. When he mentions the \u201ctruth\u201d about Peter\u2019s father, he is referring to an experiment that Richard Parker was working on, which indirectly transformed Peter into Spider-Man.\n\nReading between the lines, The Gentleman is intrigued by this situation and is happy to sit back and watch what Spider-Man does next. He is interested to see what choices Spidey makes and whether this will benefit him.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nFast forward to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and The Gentleman is now working closely with Harry Osborn on a project to form a team. He mentions that Spider-Man has \u201cgone\u201d which suggests this exchange takes place during a period in which Spidey is on a leave of absence (following the death of his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy).\n\nFrom this second exchange it is now clear that Spider-Man is no longer of interest to The Gentleman and this group he is putting together will include new people.\n\nAs The Amazing Spider-Man film series ended after the second entry, the full details of the group remain somewhat of a mystery. However, thanks to a few details revealed on screen, as well as some behind the scenes information regarding the Amazing series, some of the motivations of The Gentleman can be pieced together.\n\nFirstly, the group he is trying to form is the Sinister Six. The group that he helped create in the aforementioned Spider-Man novels, is the same group he is trying to create in the film series.\n\nHow do I know this? Because when The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was in production, Sony Pictures \u2013 the studio behind the Spider-Man movies \u2013 was in discussions to develop a film based around the Sinister Six. The film was to be released after The Amazing Spider-Man 2, but before The Amazing Spider-Man 3.\n\nWhile neither the Sinister Six movie or The Amazing Spider-Man 3 went ahead, director Marc Webb has let out a few titbits about what the films might have included. I\u2019ve written a post about The Amazing Spider-Man 3, which you should check out, but in short, a newly resurrected Norman Osborn would have been involved in some capacity, and the Vulture would have been part of the team.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAs for the rest of the group, well Doctor Octopus\u2019s tentacles were viewed in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and the Rhino was introduced at the very end of the movie. The Green Goblin \u2013 be it Norman or Harry \u2013 would likely have been included in the team too.\n\nSo, that\u2019s Green Goblin, Vulture, Doctor Octopus and Vulture. That covers four spaces in the team of six.\n\nThe other two spots could have been left over for established characters, such as The Lizard who was already part of the movie series, or they could have been reserved for new blood. It has never been made clear.\n\nAdvertisements\n\nEither way, The Gentleman was introduced into The Amazing Spider-Man films to help usher in the Sinister Six. Had the series lasted a little longer we would have seen his plan come to fruition, but instead we were largely given a background player that lurked in the shadows.\n\nSo, next time you watch The Amazing Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, keep an eye out for The Gentleman. He is up to something and now you know what it is.\n\nRead more:\n\nAdvertisements\n\nAdvertisements"}, {"url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-spideys-in-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-full-spoilers-edition", "page_content": "The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse starts with Miles Morales\u2019s mother telling him to take care of himself, and that\u2019s advice he really should take to heart, because he\u2019s about to wind up in a really sticky situation where a whole multiverse worth of Spider-People are after him.

His two films, \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" and \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2,\" were the weakest-performing among Sony's live-action Spider-Man movies, according to Screen Rant. The two films, which were directed by Marc Webb, are also currently the lowest-rated Spider-Man movies on Rotten Tomatoes. As for the actor himself, Andrew has described his time in Spider-Man's webbed boots as \"heartbreaking,\" which is undeniably a tragic thing to hear from someone who grew up with a deep affection for the character.\n\nThe abrupt end to Andrew's run as the webslinger has raised many questions about the ill-fated franchise, including why the planned trilogy became a duology and what the future could have been like for Andrew's version of Spider-Man. Given how the meteoric success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe has enabled his successor Tom Holland to meet and work with other superheroes, it's interesting to think about the position Andrew's Spider-Man could have been in, had the actor's time as the wallcrawler not been cut short. From the circumstances that brought about \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" and its sequel to the ways Andrew embraced being Spider-Man, here are some interesting facts about the English actor's take on the beloved superhero."}]}
