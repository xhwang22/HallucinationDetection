In 2020 he published his first book of poetry Just the Night Birds and made a film for his mailing list subscribers titled The Apartment Show He Never Gave, while releasing what he termed a \u201csurprise\u201d album, Songs From The Apartment.\n\nSongs From The Apartment was a stripped-down lo-fi affair recorded in his home using a cheap tape recorder with an internal microphone. Two songs from Nothing Pressing \u2014 Underground Blues and Sinking In \u2014 were also recorded in Leger\u2019s home, this time using two Shure SM58 microphones fed into his vintage 1981 Tascam 4-track tape recorder. The remaining nine tracks included on Nothing Pressing present Leger\u2019s work in two starkly contrasting soundscapes. Nothing Pressing, Protector and Still Patience are solo acoustic recordings cut live in the studio with little embellishment save Dan Mock\u2019s overdubbed harmony vocals and, on the title track, producer (and Cowboy Junkies guitarist) Michael Timmins\u2019 ukulele. The other six tracks are prime roots rock \u2019n\u2019 roll featuring his long-time band The Situation (drummer Kyle Sullivan and bassist Mock). Among the latter songs, Kill It With Kindness and Have You Ever Been Happy? have the kind of drive, energy and spirit that are sure to make them highlights of his future live shows.\n\nLeger often times finds himself at a loss as to explain the source of his songs. He feels his songwriting, while clearly drawing on experiences filtered through a panoply of influences, often verges on being a supernatural experience. Over the course of the 11 songs on Nothing Pressing, the songwriter\u2019s songwriter engages with questions of existence, mortality, hope, trust, and heartbreak while simultaneously conjuring feelings of isolation, reflection, longing, and gratitude. Paired with such evocative lyrics are wonderfully crafted melodies, soulful vocals, and the spirit and energy of a mature songwriter, comfortable in his skin and growing as an artist with every release. Nothing Pressing serves a wonderfully refreshing tonic in troubling times.\n\nBorn in the mid-\u201980s, singer-songwriter Leger came of age in the Upper Beaches area of Toronto. Surrounded by music from a young age, his grandfather first turned him on to Hank Williams, constantly playing the youngster a plethora of the honky-tonk master\u2019s great recordings. Although Williams\u2019 voice came from another world in terms of time, geography, and class, Leger was intrigued by the ways that Williams\u2019 songs told a story and often conjured up mysterious images in his head. Other seminal influences were slowly added, including John Lennon (and The Beatles), Bob Dylan, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello, Neil Young, The Everly Brothers, Tom Waits and Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nIn 2005, as Leger turned 19, he cut his first independently released album. In the 16 years since then the multi-talented singer-songwriter has recorded nine additional studio albums as well as one live compilation under his own name. In 2014 he was signed to the Cowboy Junkies\u2019 label Latent Recordings, releasing the critically acclaimed Early Riser that same year. His second Latent release, Nonsense and Heartache, followed in 2017. A year later the two-album set was picked up for distribution in the U.K and Europe, leading to extensive touring throughout the continent, opening up a whole new audience for Leger\u2019s finely crafted songs. With his next album, 2019\u2019s Time Out For Tomorrow, Leger began to receive positive notices in high-profile music magazines.\n\nA restless hungry spirit, when not performing and recording under his own name, Leger stays busy with a plethora of side projects including The Del Fi\u2019s (who play loose, improvisatory rock \u2019n\u2019 roll) and The Bop Fi\u2019s (which features Leger reciting his poetry over jazz accompaniment). He has also been known to work under the pseudonym Hank Holly (bonus points go to those who can figure out where that name came from!).\u201d"}, {"url": "https://countrylowdown.com/2023/03/27/jerry-leger/", "page_content": "UK & IRELAND TOUR ANNOUNCED FOR MAY\n\nLATENT UNCOVERS EP, OUT NOW\n\nWatch new video for lead track \u201cYou Are Not Alone\u201d\n\n(written by Jeff Tweedy and originally recorded by Mavis Staples)\n\n\u201cJerry Leger has that spark in him that all the great songwriters have.

The four songs were recorded and filmed live in the studio as part of a covers series for Cowboy Junkies\u2019 Latent Recordings label and comprise:\n\n\u201cWhat Goes On\u201d (originally recorded by Velvet Underground, written by Lou Reed)\n\n\u201cThe Law\u201d (originally recorded and written by Leonard Cohen)\n\n\u201cYou Are Not Alone\u201d (originally recorded by Mavis Staples, written by Jeff Tweedy)\n\n\u201cJanine\u201d (originally recorded and written by David Bowie)\n\nBorn in the mid-80s and surrounded by music from a young age, singer-songwriter Jerry Leger\u2019s first musical influences were his grandfather\u2019s Hank Williams records. Leger was intrigued by the way that Williams\u2019 songs told a story and often conjured up mysterious images in his head. By the time he came of age in the East End of Toronto, other seminal influences had been added, including John Lennon and the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello, Neil Young, The Everly Brothers, Tom Waits, and Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nIn 2005, a nineteen-year-old Leger cut his first independently released album. Since then, the prolific singer-songwriter has recorded 10 additional albums under his own name, with the last 4 released via Cowboy Junkies\u2019 label, Latent Recordings.\n\nReleased in March of 2022, Leger\u2019s album Nothing Pressing (produced by Michael Timmins) received positive reviews in prestigious music magazines, including Uncut and Rolling Stone. Evocative lyrics paired with wonderfully crafted melodies, soulful vocals and the spirit and energy of a mature songwriter, Nothing Pressing showcased an artist comfortable in his own skin and growing in stature with every release. Leger and his band supported the album with a successful UK and European tour, before returning to Toronto for a packed hometown show at Paradise Theatre. This performance was captured on tape and film, resulting in the EP Live From Paradise, released at the beginning of 2023.\n\nNotes by Jerry Leger on Latent Uncovers EP:\n\n\u201cWhat Goes On\u201d is pure rock \u2018n\u2019 roll with swagger; a very fun song to play. I\u2019d love to hear Matthew Sweet do a medley of his song \u201cGirlfriend\u201d with this, if I don\u2019t beat him to it!\n\n\u201cThe Law\u201d has one of my favourite Leonard Cohen lines, \u201cmy heart\u2019s like a blister from doing what I do\u201d. Maybe \u2019cause I can relate in my own way, which I think is the sign of a very effective lyric. We play this song a little faster and with more punch than the original. That\u2019s just how it came out but I love the original arrangement too and the album it\u2019s off of,Various Positions. When Cohen delivered this album to his record company, they told him, \u201cLeonard, we know you\u2019re great but we don\u2019t know if you\u2019re any good.\u201d I don\u2019t remember the name of the guy who said that to him\u2026\n\n\u201cYou Are Not Alone\u201d is a song written by Jeff Tweedy (and I think one of his best) and originally recorded by the incredible Mavis Staples, produced by Tweedy. Dan Mock (the bass player in my band) introduced me to this tune and I think we did a really nice version of it.\n\n\u201cJanine\u201d is one of my favourite hidden gems from David Bowie. It\u2019s a track off of the first Bowie album I owned as a kid. This EP kind of turned into a collection of some of my favourite hidden gems. Maybe I should have called it Hidden Gems Vol. 1\u2026!"}, {"url": "https://jerryleger.bandcamp.com/album/too-broke-to-die-retrospective-2005-2019", "page_content": "about\n\nOriginally released as a Europe-only compilation CD in the Spring of 2019, with selections from the first 8 studio albums and two outtakes plus one track from the live album 'Live On Stage.'\n\ncredits\n\nreleased March 27, 2019\n\n\n\nJerry Leger - vocals & guitar on all tracks\n\nand The Situation\n\nJames McKie - fiddle on tracks 8, 9, 14, 15 / guitar on tracks 7, 11-17 / lap steel on tracks 18-20 / banjo on The Joke's On You\n\nDan Mock - bass on all tracks except for 1-5, 8, 10, 21 / vocals on tracks 12, 13, 18-20\n\nKyle Sullivan - drums & percussion on all tracks except for Beating The Storm and Round Walls / vocals on tracks 2, 4, 13, 18\n\nCorey Stinson - bass on tracks 1-4, 21 / vocals on Old Shoes On My Feet\n\n\n\nTim Bovaconti - guitar on tracks 1-6, 11, 12, 21 / pedal steel on See My Baby Run / lap steel on You Got Away From Me and Riverside / percussion on tracks 3, 6, 8, 10, 12, 21 / vocals on tracks 2, 3, 6-8, 12, 21 / piano on Wrong Kind Of Girl / keys on You Got Away From Me\n\nTimothy Cameron - banjo & guitar on See My Baby Run / vocals on Old Shoes On My Feet and See My Baby Run\n\nTerence Gowan - piano & farfisa on Red City / piano on See My Baby Run\n\nFergus Hambleton - vocals on See My Baby Run\n\nDon Kerr - vocals on Old Shoes On My Feet and See My Baby Run\n\nRon Sexsmith - piano on Old Shoes On My Feet and Den Of Sin\n\nJosh Finlayson - banjo on Round Walls / guitar on Beating The Storm\n\nAaron Comeau - piano on Pass The Time, Factory Made and Nobody's Angel\n\nCarleigh Aikins, Tamara Lindeman, Ivy Mairi - vocals on Factory Made and You Really Got It So Bad\n\nJeff Heisholt - organ on Factory Made, You Really Got It So Bad and Nobody's Angel\n\nAngie Hilts - vocals on The Big Smoke Blues\n\n\n\nTracks 1 & 21 taken from Jerry Leger & The Situation\n\nTracks 2-4 taken from Farewell Ghost Town\n\nTrack 6 taken from You, Me & The Horse\n\nTracks 7-9 taken from Traveling Grey\n\nTrack 10 taken from The Good Old Days Are Back In Drag\n\nTracks 11 & 12 taken from Some Folks Know\n\nTrack 13 taken from Live On Stage\n\nTracks 14 & 16 taken from Early Riser\n\nTracks 17-20 taken from Nonsense and Heartache\n\n\n\nTrack 5, outtake from the You, Me & The Horse sessions\n\nTrack 15, outtake from the Early Riser sessions\n\n\n\nCompilation engineering and preparation by Tim Bovaconti at Tim's Garage, Toronto, Canada\n\nphotography by LPPhotographs\n\nDesign and layout by Jonny Desilva at Rockwell Creative\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}, {"url": "https://jerryleger.com/about/", "page_content": "Bio\n\nBorn in the mid-80s, singer-songwriter Jerry Leger came of age in the Upper Beaches area of Toronto.

In between all that activity, Leger also cut a handful of one-off singles.

He started releasing his albums on vinyl as early as 2010\u2019s Travelling Grey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been buying vinyl since I was a little kid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first album I bought when I was eight was John Lennon\u2019s Mind Games album. When I was about five or six, my Dad gave me a stack of records and a record player, and that started me off. I love records. There\u2019s just something about it that you don\u2019t get from listening to stuff digitally. It\u2019s hard to hand down files to your kids. I like listening to albums from start to finish.\u201d\n\nJerry\u2019s debut album was released in 2005 when he was still a teenager. He admitted that he often felt like an outsider while coming of age in Toronto\u2019s East End.\n\n\u201cGrowing up and still living in the East End of Toronto you\u2019re very separated from where the action is, and those scenes,\u201d he said. I remember feeling very kind of not part of people\u2019s treehouses, or on the outside looking in when I would go downtown. I was never in the cool groups. I was never invited into those circles. I always felt very separated from that living in the East End.\u201d\n\nBut Jerry\u2019s love of music would force him out of his comfort zone resulting in him sneaking into Toronto bars to perform when he was just 17 years old. It also resulted in him meeting another eastender, producer and musician Tim Bovaconti, who ended up opening a lot of doors for the artist. Tim would go on to produce or co-produce Jerry\u2019s first five albums.\n\nJerry\u2019s East End lifestyle did lead to a chance meeting with another famous Canadian artist.\n\n\u201cRon (Sexsmith) used to live in the East End,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time I met him was when I was working at Home Hardware and he would come in, and of course, I knew who he was. I gave him a demo CD, and he actually listened to it and liked it and gave some cool feedback.\u201d\n\nRon Sexsmith would end up performing on Jerry\u2019s sophomore album 2006\u2019s Farewell Ghost Town and again on 2012\u2019s Some Folks Know.\n\nJerry\u2019s incredibly tight backing band is known as the Situation. Jerry\u2019s high school friend, drummer Kyle Sullivan, appeared on his debut album and has remained a member of the Situation ever since. By Jerry\u2019s third album, 2008\u2019s You, Me and the Horse, Jerry and Kyle were joined by guitarist James McKie and bassist Dan Mock, forming the lineup that remains over twelve years later.\n\nJerry explained, \u201cWe\u2019re friends and we get along. That\u2019s a big part of it. We\u2019re all invested in a way in bringing something honest, whatever \u2018honest\u2019 means. Maybe the word \u2018honest\u2019 isn\u2019t honest, but whatever \u2018honest\u2019 means, in what we\u2019re doing, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to bring to people. And I think we all personally get off on that. Especially when other people get into it.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that when I caught Jerry and the Situation\u2019s late-night set on the closing night of the second annual Troubadour Festival in Barrie, ON last month, I saw a well-oiled machine that continues to enjoy playing music together and playing music in front of an audience. The band\u2019s set included several songs from Jerry\u2019s forthcoming album Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nUnlike 2017\u2019s double LP Nonsense and Heartache, Time Out \u2026 isn\u2019t a concept album, Jerry said.\n\n\u201cYou let the music go in whatever direction it wants to go for that time period. The next record, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to sound like. I don\u2019t think always under the same umbrella. Some songs are more observational. Some songs have a piece of my life in it just \u2019cause you can\u2019t always help it.\u201d\n\nTogether with producer Michael Timmins (Cowboy Junkies), Jerry and his band would record 20 songs, finally settling on 10 that would form the album version. Most of the songs were written specifically for Time Out For Tomorrow, with the exception of \u201cTell A Lie.\u201d While it was originally recorded during 2017\u2019s Nonsense and Heartache sessions, Jerry didn\u2019t feel that it fit the concept for that album. Thankfully, when it came time to record his next album, he found the right place for the song and re-recorded it for Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nThe last song to be written for Time Out For Tomorrow would turn out to be the first track on the album, \u201cCanvas Of Gold,\u201d a beautiful, well-crafted song that perfectly sets the tone for the entire album.\n\n\u201cBurchell Lake\u201d was inspired by Ghost Towns of Ontario: Field Guide Vol. 2., a book by Canadian author Ron Brown. The song is about the town of Burchell Lake, an actual ghost town located southwest of Thunder Bay, ON.\n\n\u201cNobody knows Ontario like Ron Brown,\u201d Jerry explained. He\u2019d owned the book for several years and, while he hasn\u2019t been able to visit Burchell Lake, it did inspire him to embark on a ghost town road trip down Highway 7 all the way to Ottawa a few years ago.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate enough to own five of Jerry Leger\u2019s albums, and after listening to Time Out For Tomorrow, I felt compelled to listen to his previous albums to try and hear if and how Jerry has evolved as a songwriter and performer.\n\nIn my opinion, Jerry Leger\u2019s greatest strength is his songwriting. It\u2019s been strong for years and Time Out For Tomorrow is another great example of that strength. It features lyrics and arrangements that don\u2019t feel the least bit contrived or formulaic. Jerry chooses not to be constricted by rigid song structure, in favour of letting the feel of the song dictate how it will unfold. The result is a fantastic album that easily engages the listener from start to finish.\n\nI certainly lost myself during Jerry Leger\u2019s Troubadour Festival set and again when I previewed my advance copy of his forthcoming album. If you\u2019re looking to escape into honest stories told through song I\u2019d highly recommend Jerry Leger and the Situation\u2019s Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nIf you are enjoying this content, please take a second to support Roots Music Canada on Patreon!"}, {"url": "https://americana-uk.com/jerry-leger-announces-new-album-due-november", "page_content": "Canadian singer-songwriter Jerry Leger has announced the release of a new studio album \u2018Time Out For Tomorrow\u2019 due on November 8th via the Cowboy Junkies\u2019 record label Latent Recordings.

The single is an outtake from Leger\u2019s 2019 album Time Out For Tomorrow, which is being released as a deluxe edition on March 26th, 2021. Also out on March 26th is the vinyl release of 2020\u2019s home-recorded album Songs From The Apartment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs with all the tracks from Time Out For Tomorrow, Jumped In The Humber was produced by Michael Timmins of alternative folk/rock band Cowboy Junkies and recorded with Leger\u2019s long-time backing band, The Situation. As Torontonians and Ontarians will note, \u201cHumber\u201d is referencing the Humber River, the 100km river with two main branches that join north of Toronto and then flow into lake Ontario.\n\nJumped in the Humber was dropped last minute from Time Out For Tomorrow, though Leger kept it in his back pocket, expecting to release it in some way in the future. One indigenous name for the Humber River, \u201cNiwa\u2019ah Onega\u2019gaih\u2019ih,\u201d \u201cLittle Thundering Waters\u201d, might sum up the atmosphere of the track. It has a moody, powerful sound and tempo that supports foreboding lyrics like \u201cYou're hired if you know how to drive /can you gun this sucker to the deep Eastside.\" The opening lyric, \u201cJumped in the Humber, or was he pushed\u201d makes one sit up in their seat on first listen.\n\nThis new single will be included as an exclusive flexi-disc record with the deluxe edition of Time Out For Tomorrow. Leger\u2019s favourite part of the release is the flexi-disc: \u201cYou don't see those around a lot anymore, but they used to come free with music magazines or promo packages. You'd get an unreleased Bob Dylan song or The Clash or somebody. I own a Who flexi-disc and all of the original Beatles fan club Christmas records were on flexi-disc.\u201d Also included in the deluxe is the album on vinyl, a download of the album with 18 exclusive bonus tracks, and a limited edition sticker and autographed poster. This edition will only be available for order from the official website store. For fans who already own Time Out For Tomorrow, the deluxe edition will also be available to order excluding the vinyl.\n\nLeger and his band were booked to tour Time Out For Tomorrow all across Europe when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. Like so many artists, he had to cancel the tour and swallow some costs. In place of touring, Leger thought it would be fun to assemble a deluxe edition of the record with bonus tracks and extra merch. Time Out For Tomorrow is a must-buy for new fans of Leger; upon its November 2019 release the album received praise from the legendary Rolling Stone, Uncut, American Songwriter, Americana UK, The Arts Desk, and fellow Canadian songwriters Doug Paisley and Ron Sexsmith. It\u2019s the third album in a row produced by Michael Timmins and released on the Cowboy Junkies\u2019 record label, Latent Recordings.\n\nThe other vinyl release out on March 26th and available for pre-order January 21st is 2020\u2019s Songs From The Apartment. The acoustic album was a surprise release during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Toronto, in late March 2020. Songs From The Apartment was initially only available digitally, and consists entirely of demos that Leger had recorded over the years in his home in Toronto\u2019s Little India. The intimate performances struck a chord with many fans who were stuck at home and filled with anxiety. \u201cAll shows were cancelled or postponed and it was almost therapeutic for me getting this record together. It also went from being just a surprise record for the fans at a difficult time for all of us, to becoming a favourite of mine. I like having an album like this, completely solo, when you can hear songs recorded at home right after they were written. Not knowing if anyone beyond myself would hear it. It naturally allows a relaxed and uninhibited performance.\u201d Songs From The Apartment will be released on translucent red vinyl as a limited run of 300 copies. This vinyl release includes a bonus track, the piano ballad \u201cSweep It Under The Rug\u201d, which is also available as a download with the deluxe edition of Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://jerryleger.com/\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/jerrylegermusic\n\nTwitter: twitter.com/JerryLeger\n\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/jerrylegermusic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.fyimusicnews.ca/articles/2019/11/06/five-questions-%E2%80%A6-jerry-leger", "page_content": "On his new album Time Out For Tomorrow, released Nov. 8, Toronto singer/songwriter Jerry Leger continues his consistently high output that began in 2005 when, at age 19, he released the first of nine studio albums. It\u2019s added up to a body of work that was recently celebrated with the European-only compilation Too Broke To Die, aimed at Leger\u2019s growing fan base in Britain and the EU.\n\nMost of those listeners didn\u2019t discover Leger until his 2014 album Early Riser, his first with Michael Timmins of Cowboy Junkies handling production duties, as well as the first to be released on the Junkies\u2019 label, Latent Recordings. The combination of Timmins\u2019 capture-the-moment production aesthetic and the Rolling Thunder-esque chemistry of Leger\u2019s longtime band The Situation (plus a few special guests) now appears unbeatable.\n\nIndeed, Time Out For Tomorrow finds Leger at the peak of his writing powers right from the opening track Canvas Of Gold, on which he laments Toronto\u2019s gentrification projects that have put pressure on the city\u2019s artistic communities. He also takes aim at tensions stoked by hate groups on the inspiring ballad That Ain\u2019t Here, although his love of early rock \u2018n roll shines brilliantly on Read Between The Lines.\n\nTime Out For Tomorrow may not be as expansive as Leger\u2019s previous Timmins-produced effort, the acclaimed 2017 double album Nonsense And Heartache, but its more concentrated dose of everything Leger does best is just as potent. Jerry Leger officially launches Time Out For Tomorrow in Toronto on Nov. 28 at Lee\u2019s Palace, followed by shows in Hamilton at Mills Hardware on Nov. 29 and in Montreal at Quai des Brumes on Nov. 30. More details here .\n\nWhat was the process like making Time Out For Tomorrow and how does it stand apart from your previous work?\n\nI definitely felt the most focused on this record in terms of how I wanted it to sound than on other albums I\u2019ve made. I usually like to go in and just see what happens. There was a bit of that still, but I did have an idea of how I wanted the songs executed.\n\nWhat songs on the record are you most proud of and why?\n\nI love I Would because it's a simple and sweet little song. That Ain't Here feels like it's been around forever and I stumbled upon it. It touches on my feelings of confusion on why the world needs to be the way it is. What's so funny about peace, love and understanding, right? I also like Corner Light because it\u2019s the most ambitious song on the record and it came out exactly the way I wanted it to.\n\nWhat's your best touring story?\n\nThere are a lot, and they usually randomly come back to me. Being on Neil Young's bus after opening for Pegi Young & The Survivors was pretty cool. Pegi was real sweet, as was the band. Her bass player Rick Rosas, who has also sadly passed away, was the one who invited me on the bus. He dug our set and grabbed an album. It was wild to sit there hanging out, eating A&W, watching a Highwayman DVD and chatting with [keyboardist] Spooner Oldham across from me!\n\nAnother one that comes to mind was playing a festival in Manitoba that also had Toby Keith or Tim McGraw on it\u2014I can\u2019t remember which. We were watching their set and convinced some of the audience members around us that we were his backing band that he\u2019d just fired. And on Canada Day to boot! We took photos with some of them.\n\nWhat are your fondest musical memories as you were growing up?\n\nListening and singing along to The Beatles, John Lennon, Rodney Crowell, and others on drives with my family when I was a kid. I also fondly recall staying after class in high school and teaching myself how to play piano in the music room and the auditorium. Employees would just be cleaning up and vacuuming around me. And I\u2019m proud to say that the first proper concert I saw was Chuck Berry. He was still great, even at that age, and his pickup band that night seemed pretty good too.\n\nWhat do you recall about your first time performing in public?\n\nIt was an old stage at a coffee shop down the street from where I grew up. Some of my school friends came to see me. I think I was 14. I played a couple of my own songs, a Dylan song and a Neil Young song. I remember it felt so good to be playing in front of people instead of the wall. I think it was the least nervous I've ever been playing in front of people. I just wanted to do it so badly, to know how it felt. I ended up getting my own night there every Wednesday for the rest of high school. There was no PA so it forced me to learn how to project my voice and my playing.\n\nFacebook / Instagram: @ jerrylegermusic\n\nTwitter: @ jerryleger\n\nLabel: Latent Recordings"}, {"url": "https://americana-uk.com/jerry-leger-announces-new-single-album-reissues-listen", "page_content": "Canadian songwriter Jerry Leger has released a new single \u2018Jumped In The Humber\u2019 which you can listen to below. The single is an outtake from his 2019 album \u2018Time Out For Tomorrow\u2019 which we raved about at the time, and that album is being released as a deluxe edition on March 26th along with the vinyl release of last year\u2019s home-recorded \u2018Songs From The Apartment\u2019. As with all the tracks from \u2018Time Out For Tomorrow\u2019, \u2018Jumped In The Humber\u2019 was produced by Michael Timmins from the Cowboy Junkies and recorded with Leger\u2019s long-time backing band, The Situation. \u2018Humber\u2019 is referencing the Humber River, the 100km river with two main branches that join north of Toronto and then flow into lake Ontario. It was dropped last minute from the album, though Leger kept it in his back pocket, expecting to release it in some way in the future.\n\nThe new single will be included as an exclusive flexi-disc record with the deluxe edition of \u2018Time Out For Tomorrow\u2019. Leger\u2019s favourite part of the release is the flexi-disc: \u201cYou don\u2019t see those around a lot anymore, but they used to come free with music magazines or promo packages. You\u2019d get an unreleased Bob Dylan song or The Clash or somebody. I own a Who flexi-disc and all of the original Beatles fan club Christmas records were on flexi-disc.\u201d Also included in the deluxe is the album on vinyl, a download of the album with 18 exclusive bonus tracks, and a limited edition sticker and autographed poster. For fans who already own the album, the deluxe edition will also be available to order excluding the vinyl. Leger and his band were booked to tour the album across Europe when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Like so many artists, he had to cancel the tour and swallow some costs, so in place of touring, Leger assembled a deluxe edition of the record with bonus tracks and extra merch.\n\nThe other vinyl release out on March 26th and available for pre-order January 21st is 2020\u2019s \u2018Songs From The Apartment\u2019.

Surrounded by music from a young age, his grandfather first turned him onto Hank Williams. Leger was intrigued by the ways that Williams\u2019 songs told a story and often conjured up mysterious images in his head. Other seminal influences were added including John Lennon (and the Beatles), Bob Dylan, Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, Leonard Cohen, Elvis Costello, Neil Young, the Everly Brothers, Tom Waits, and Gordon Lightfoot.\n\nIn 2005, a nineteen year old Leger cut his first independently released album. Since then, the prolific singer-songwriter has recorded10 additional albums under his own name, with the last 4 released via Cowboy Junkies\u2019 label, Latent Recordings.\n\nReleased in March of 2022, Jerry\u2019s album Nothing Pressing (produced by Michael Timmins) received positive notices in such music magazines as Uncut and Rolling Stone. Paired with such evocative lyrics are wonderfully crafted melodies, soulful vocals and the spirit and energy of a mature songwriter, comfortable in his skin and growing as an artist with every release. Leger and his band supported the album with a successful European and UK tour, before returning to Toronto for a packed hometown show at Paradise Theatre. This performance was captured on tape and film, resulting in the EP Live From Paradise released at the beginning of 2023.\n\n\u201cJerry Leger has that spark in him that all the great songwriters have.

Characterful vocals: check. Masterful musicianship: check. Sublime songcraft: check. For many listeners, a Jerry Leger album is the very definition of Americana. Since his 2005 debut, Leger has been hugely prolific while managing a remarkably consistent quality in his output. \u2018Time Out for Tomorrow\u2019 is no exception, finding Leger and his band, The Situation, in fine form. The album is lean, focused and coherent, both musically and thematically.\n\nIt is more direct than previous releases, such as \u2018Nonsense and Heartache\u2019, and is immediately engaging. Throughout the record, Leger sings of the ephemeral nature of life, dreams, seasons, places, relationships, industry: all things come and go; all things have an ending. Although Leger\u2019s lyrics can be obscure, \u2018Time Out for Tomorrow\u2019 is full of poetry, arresting images and narrative details that capture attention. Great care has been taken over the language; as he sings on the first track and single, \u2018Canvas of Gold\u2019: \u201cMy head was in the drift smoke // My heart was in the words // Of the poet and the hobo you never heard.\u201d As soon as the drums and guitar kick in on the opener, listeners will know that they\u2019re in for an authentic-sounding treat. The timeless melody and instrumentation are matched by Leger\u2019s socially conscious lines: \u201cEverything was almost decided when we were young // You\u2019ll stay poor like your family before // And I\u2019ll keep hustling.\u201d This is followed by the gently tuneful strum and effective bass in \u2018Justine\u2019. Leger explores the complexity of relationships through a series of poetic flourishes: \u201cShe gave me a lie and made me like it\u2026Oh, the lights from your distant tower\u2026She took my name and put it in her right-side pocket.\u201d Leger\u2019s gravelly vocal performance on the piano-driven third song, \u2018That Ain\u2019t Here\u2019, is gorgeously balanced. This opening trio of songs is an outstanding introduction.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s all unmistakably Jerry Leger, there\u2019s plenty of variation in tone and pace; from the jangling electric guitars of \u2018Tell a Lie\u2019 or the great rhythms of \u2018Burchell Lake\u2019 to the slower, melodic \u2018I Would\u2019, Leger keeps hooking us in. It\u2019s an album full of highlights. In particular, special mention must go to \u2018Read Between the Lines\u2019, on which the tuneful singing, complete with rising, echoing backing vocals, brings to mind \u201960s pop and rock, and to the hauntingly beautiful \u2018Survived Like a Stone\u2019. On this, Leger\u2019s lovely vocal is buoyed by layers of sumptuous instrumentation: fiddle, autoharp, organ, drums, all masterfully executed. Indeed, the musicianship of The Situation throughout is worth celebrating; particularly noteworthy is Dan Mock on bass, whose excellent work elevates songs like \u2018Corner Light\u2019, along with flourishes of Aaron Comeau\u2019s piano.\n\nThe album was recorded quickly, capturing a focused, direct vibe, and produced by The Cowboy Junkies\u2019 Michael Timmins, who brings out the warmth of each instrument. If listeners are long-time Jerry Leger fans, then they can look forward to another strong release full of potential new favourites. If you\u2019re new to Leger, then the immediacy of \u2018Time Out for Tomorrow\u2019 makes it an ideal album to absorb and introduce the rest of his work. On \u2018I Would\u2019, Leger sings: \u201cI wish I was a book you were reading // Honest and too tough to put down,\u201d and, indeed, it\u2019s tough to stop listening.\n\nA masterful example of Americana songcraft and accomplished musical performance 9/10 9/10\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\n"}, {"url": "https://exclaim.ca/music/article/jerry_leger-time_out_for_tomorrow", "page_content": "Jerry Leger Time Out for Tomorrow\n\nPublished Nov 12, 2019\n\n7\n\n\"Playing dominos in the general store / Ain't nobody playing them games no more\" sings Jerry Leger plaintively, as fiddle notes all but weep in the background, on \"Burchell Lake.\" The Toronto folk rocker is a yesteryear yearning troubadour on that must-listen track and many others from his new album Time Out for Tomorrow.What's more, the tone and style of Leger's music here hungrily harken back to Bob Dylan , circa Blood on the Tracks. \"Canvas of Gold,\" for instance, boasts moaning guitar and the downtrodden saunter of his backing band's rhythm section, as Leger juxtaposes sooty ashtrays with the artistic treasures of the song's namesake via his reedy singing.Leger's other Dylan-worthy turns of phrase include a wish to become the book his lady is reading (and be \"tough to put down\") over the sturdy rhythms of \"I Would.\" Then there's his astute observation that hating heartache can make you feel alive on \"Tell a Lie.\"While Leger by no means reinvents the wheel on Time Out for Tomorrow, he does admirably keep it turning (or, more aptly, keeps Dylan's rolling stone a rollin'). It's not as ambitious an LP as those released by his apparent muses, or by Leger himself in 2017 (the double album Nonsense and Heartache that he put out then was a sprawling highlight of the year). Regardless, Time Out for Tomorrow is a thoroughly catchy, beautifully crafted folk rock record that's more than worth your time.

He started releasing his albums on vinyl as early as 2010\u2019s Travelling Grey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been buying vinyl since I was a little kid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first album I bought when I was eight was John Lennon\u2019s Mind Games album. When I was about five or six, my Dad gave me a stack of records and a record player, and that started me off. I love records. There\u2019s just something about it that you don\u2019t get from listening to stuff digitally. It\u2019s hard to hand down files to your kids. I like listening to albums from start to finish.\u201d\n\nJerry\u2019s debut album was released in 2005 when he was still a teenager. He admitted that he often felt like an outsider while coming of age in Toronto\u2019s East End.\n\n\u201cGrowing up and still living in the East End of Toronto you\u2019re very separated from where the action is, and those scenes,\u201d he said. I remember feeling very kind of not part of people\u2019s treehouses, or on the outside looking in when I would go downtown. I was never in the cool groups. I was never invited into those circles. I always felt very separated from that living in the East End.\u201d\n\nBut Jerry\u2019s love of music would force him out of his comfort zone resulting in him sneaking into Toronto bars to perform when he was just 17 years old. It also resulted in him meeting another eastender, producer and musician Tim Bovaconti, who ended up opening a lot of doors for the artist. Tim would go on to produce or co-produce Jerry\u2019s first five albums.\n\nJerry\u2019s East End lifestyle did lead to a chance meeting with another famous Canadian artist.\n\n\u201cRon (Sexsmith) used to live in the East End,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time I met him was when I was working at Home Hardware and he would come in, and of course, I knew who he was. I gave him a demo CD, and he actually listened to it and liked it and gave some cool feedback.\u201d\n\nRon Sexsmith would end up performing on Jerry\u2019s sophomore album 2006\u2019s Farewell Ghost Town and again on 2012\u2019s Some Folks Know.\n\nJerry\u2019s incredibly tight backing band is known as the Situation. Jerry\u2019s high school friend, drummer Kyle Sullivan, appeared on his debut album and has remained a member of the Situation ever since. By Jerry\u2019s third album, 2008\u2019s You, Me and the Horse, Jerry and Kyle were joined by guitarist James McKie and bassist Dan Mock, forming the lineup that remains over twelve years later.\n\nJerry explained, \u201cWe\u2019re friends and we get along. That\u2019s a big part of it. We\u2019re all invested in a way in bringing something honest, whatever \u2018honest\u2019 means. Maybe the word \u2018honest\u2019 isn\u2019t honest, but whatever \u2018honest\u2019 means, in what we\u2019re doing, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to bring to people. And I think we all personally get off on that. Especially when other people get into it.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that when I caught Jerry and the Situation\u2019s late-night set on the closing night of the second annual Troubadour Festival in Barrie, ON last month, I saw a well-oiled machine that continues to enjoy playing music together and playing music in front of an audience. The band\u2019s set included several songs from Jerry\u2019s forthcoming album Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nUnlike 2017\u2019s double LP Nonsense and Heartache, Time Out \u2026 isn\u2019t a concept album, Jerry said.\n\n\u201cYou let the music go in whatever direction it wants to go for that time period. The next record, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to sound like. I don\u2019t think always under the same umbrella. Some songs are more observational. Some songs have a piece of my life in it just \u2019cause you can\u2019t always help it.\u201d\n\nTogether with producer Michael Timmins (Cowboy Junkies), Jerry and his band would record 20 songs, finally settling on 10 that would form the album version. Most of the songs were written specifically for Time Out For Tomorrow, with the exception of \u201cTell A Lie.\u201d While it was originally recorded during 2017\u2019s Nonsense and Heartache sessions, Jerry didn\u2019t feel that it fit the concept for that album. Thankfully, when it came time to record his next album, he found the right place for the song and re-recorded it for Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nThe last song to be written for Time Out For Tomorrow would turn out to be the first track on the album, \u201cCanvas Of Gold,\u201d a beautiful, well-crafted song that perfectly sets the tone for the entire album.\n\n\u201cBurchell Lake\u201d was inspired by Ghost Towns of Ontario: Field Guide Vol. 2., a book by Canadian author Ron Brown. The song is about the town of Burchell Lake, an actual ghost town located southwest of Thunder Bay, ON.\n\n\u201cNobody knows Ontario like Ron Brown,\u201d Jerry explained. He\u2019d owned the book for several years and, while he hasn\u2019t been able to visit Burchell Lake, it did inspire him to embark on a ghost town road trip down Highway 7 all the way to Ottawa a few years ago.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate enough to own five of Jerry Leger\u2019s albums, and after listening to Time Out For Tomorrow, I felt compelled to listen to his previous albums to try and hear if and how Jerry has evolved as a songwriter and performer.\n\nIn my opinion, Jerry Leger\u2019s greatest strength is his songwriting. It\u2019s been strong for years and Time Out For Tomorrow is another great example of that strength. It features lyrics and arrangements that don\u2019t feel the least bit contrived or formulaic. Jerry chooses not to be constricted by rigid song structure, in favour of letting the feel of the song dictate how it will unfold. The result is a fantastic album that easily engages the listener from start to finish.\n\nI certainly lost myself during Jerry Leger\u2019s Troubadour Festival set and again when I previewed my advance copy of his forthcoming album. If you\u2019re looking to escape into honest stories told through song I\u2019d highly recommend Jerry Leger and the Situation\u2019s Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nIf you are enjoying this content, please take a second to support Roots Music Canada on Patreon!"}, {"url": "https://entertainment-focus.com/2019/11/18/jerry-leger-time-out-for-tomorrow-album-review/", "page_content": "Canadian singer-songwriter Jerry Leger released his debut album Jerry Leger & The Situation in 2005. Since then he\u2019s been fairly prolific release a new album almost every single year. His last was 2018\u2019s Residuals with the Del Fi\u2019s and he\u2019s picked up a pretty dedicated fanbase over the years. For his latest album, Time Out For Tomorrow, Leger has once again teamed up with Cowboy Junkies member Michael Timmins who produces the 10-song set.\n\nTime Out For Tomorrow opens with lead single Canvas of Gold, a pure slice of Americana with introspective lyrics and coloured by Leger\u2019s distinctive voice. At times Leger\u2019s delivery is reminiscent of Bob Dylan in his prime, particularly the way that it sounds more like he\u2019s sharing intimate stories than singing songs with broad appeal. Timmins\u2019 production, on this song and indeed the entire record, brings out the warmth of the instrumentation without ever detracting from what Leger has to say.\n\nThe steady beat of Justine combines with short bursts of electric guitar for a jingly-jangly moment while on Tell a Lie leans more into alt-rock as Leger tells a woman that although he loved her, he knew their relationship would never last. Elsewhere on the record Read Between the Lines has a 60s influence that brings to mind Roy Orbison, I Would paints a dreamy soundscape behind Leger\u2019s shimmering and delicate vocals, and Corner Light layers Leger\u2019s vocals for one of the album\u2019s more uptempo moments.\n\nThe stripped-back Survived Like a Stone is one of the stand-out moments on the record. It has an old-school Country feel about it and the stirring guitar riffs evoke days gone by. It\u2019s one of the moments on the album where Timmins really fleshes out the production, making the whole song sound rather epic. Tomorrow in My Mind is the closer and it\u2019s a mid-tempo number that brings the record to a satisfying conclusion.\n\nWhere I\u2019d perhaps criticise the record is that there isn\u2019t a huge amount of variety. I admire and respect Leger\u2019s abilities a songwriter and storyteller but there are moments where the music, as enjoyable as it is, passes you by without grabbing you. This is in part due to the familiar sounds that each track carries and there\u2019s no moment where Leger really pushes out of his comfort zone.\n\nTime Out For Tomorrow will definitely appeal to fans of the traditional Americana sound. Leger is the real deal and his music drips with authenticity. He also has plenty to say and the more you listen to these tracks, the more they\u2019ll grow on you. For me, it\u2019s not an instant album and it takes a little work to get to the heart of it. If you\u2019re prepared to put in the time and effort, you\u2019ll find yourself rewarded.\n\n\ufeff\n\nTrack list: 1. Canvas of Gold 2. Justine 3. That Ain\u2019t Here 4. Tell a Lie 5.

Characterful vocals: check. Masterful musicianship: check. Sublime songcraft: check. For many listeners, a Jerry Leger album is the very definition of Americana. Since his 2005 debut, Leger has been hugely prolific while managing a remarkably consistent quality in his output. \u2018Time Out for Tomorrow\u2019 is no exception, finding Leger and his band, The Situation, in fine form. The album is lean, focused and coherent, both musically and thematically.\n\nIt is more direct than previous releases, such as \u2018Nonsense and Heartache\u2019, and is immediately engaging. Throughout the record, Leger sings of the ephemeral nature of life, dreams, seasons, places, relationships, industry: all things come and go; all things have an ending. Although Leger\u2019s lyrics can be obscure, \u2018Time Out for Tomorrow\u2019 is full of poetry, arresting images and narrative details that capture attention. Great care has been taken over the language; as he sings on the first track and single, \u2018Canvas of Gold\u2019: \u201cMy head was in the drift smoke // My heart was in the words // Of the poet and the hobo you never heard.\u201d As soon as the drums and guitar kick in on the opener, listeners will know that they\u2019re in for an authentic-sounding treat. The timeless melody and instrumentation are matched by Leger\u2019s socially conscious lines: \u201cEverything was almost decided when we were young // You\u2019ll stay poor like your family before // And I\u2019ll keep hustling.\u201d This is followed by the gently tuneful strum and effective bass in \u2018Justine\u2019. Leger explores the complexity of relationships through a series of poetic flourishes: \u201cShe gave me a lie and made me like it\u2026Oh, the lights from your distant tower\u2026She took my name and put it in her right-side pocket.\u201d Leger\u2019s gravelly vocal performance on the piano-driven third song, \u2018That Ain\u2019t Here\u2019, is gorgeously balanced. This opening trio of songs is an outstanding introduction.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s all unmistakably Jerry Leger, there\u2019s plenty of variation in tone and pace; from the jangling electric guitars of \u2018Tell a Lie\u2019 or the great rhythms of \u2018Burchell Lake\u2019 to the slower, melodic \u2018I Would\u2019, Leger keeps hooking us in. It\u2019s an album full of highlights. In particular, special mention must go to \u2018Read Between the Lines\u2019, on which the tuneful singing, complete with rising, echoing backing vocals, brings to mind \u201960s pop and rock, and to the hauntingly beautiful \u2018Survived Like a Stone\u2019. On this, Leger\u2019s lovely vocal is buoyed by layers of sumptuous instrumentation: fiddle, autoharp, organ, drums, all masterfully executed. Indeed, the musicianship of The Situation throughout is worth celebrating; particularly noteworthy is Dan Mock on bass, whose excellent work elevates songs like \u2018Corner Light\u2019, along with flourishes of Aaron Comeau\u2019s piano.\n\nThe album was recorded quickly, capturing a focused, direct vibe, and produced by The Cowboy Junkies\u2019 Michael Timmins, who brings out the warmth of each instrument. If listeners are long-time Jerry Leger fans, then they can look forward to another strong release full of potential new favourites. If you\u2019re new to Leger, then the immediacy of \u2018Time Out for Tomorrow\u2019 makes it an ideal album to absorb and introduce the rest of his work. On \u2018I Would\u2019, Leger sings: \u201cI wish I was a book you were reading // Honest and too tough to put down,\u201d and, indeed, it\u2019s tough to stop listening.\n\nA masterful example of Americana songcraft and accomplished musical performance 9/10 9/10\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nWhatsApp\n\n"}, {"url": "https://exclaim.ca/music/article/jerry_leger-time_out_for_tomorrow", "page_content": "Jerry Leger Time Out for Tomorrow\n\nPublished Nov 12, 2019\n\n7\n\n\"Playing dominos in the general store / Ain't nobody playing them games no more\" sings Jerry Leger plaintively, as fiddle notes all but weep in the background, on \"Burchell Lake.\" The Toronto folk rocker is a yesteryear yearning troubadour on that must-listen track and many others from his new album Time Out for Tomorrow.What's more, the tone and style of Leger's music here hungrily harken back to Bob Dylan , circa Blood on the Tracks. \"Canvas of Gold,\" for instance, boasts moaning guitar and the downtrodden saunter of his backing band's rhythm section, as Leger juxtaposes sooty ashtrays with the artistic treasures of the song's namesake via his reedy singing.Leger's other Dylan-worthy turns of phrase include a wish to become the book his lady is reading (and be \"tough to put down\") over the sturdy rhythms of \"I Would.\" Then there's his astute observation that hating heartache can make you feel alive on \"Tell a Lie.\"While Leger by no means reinvents the wheel on Time Out for Tomorrow, he does admirably keep it turning (or, more aptly, keeps Dylan's rolling stone a rollin'). It's not as ambitious an LP as those released by his apparent muses, or by Leger himself in 2017 (the double album Nonsense and Heartache that he put out then was a sprawling highlight of the year). Regardless, Time Out for Tomorrow is a thoroughly catchy, beautifully crafted folk rock record that's more than worth your time. ( Latent"}, {"url": "https://entertainment-focus.com/2019/11/18/jerry-leger-time-out-for-tomorrow-album-review/", "page_content": "Canadian singer-songwriter Jerry Leger released his debut album Jerry Leger & The Situation in 2005. Since then he\u2019s been fairly prolific release a new album almost every single year. His last was 2018\u2019s Residuals with the Del Fi\u2019s and he\u2019s picked up a pretty dedicated fanbase over the years. For his latest album, Time Out For Tomorrow, Leger has once again teamed up with Cowboy Junkies member Michael Timmins who produces the 10-song set.\n\nTime Out For Tomorrow opens with lead single Canvas of Gold, a pure slice of Americana with introspective lyrics and coloured by Leger\u2019s distinctive voice. At times Leger\u2019s delivery is reminiscent of Bob Dylan in his prime, particularly the way that it sounds more like he\u2019s sharing intimate stories than singing songs with broad appeal. Timmins\u2019 production, on this song and indeed the entire record, brings out the warmth of the instrumentation without ever detracting from what Leger has to say.\n\nThe steady beat of Justine combines with short bursts of electric guitar for a jingly-jangly moment while on Tell a Lie leans more into alt-rock as Leger tells a woman that although he loved her, he knew their relationship would never last. Elsewhere on the record Read Between the Lines has a 60s influence that brings to mind Roy Orbison, I Would paints a dreamy soundscape behind Leger\u2019s shimmering and delicate vocals, and Corner Light layers Leger\u2019s vocals for one of the album\u2019s more uptempo moments.\n\nThe stripped-back Survived Like a Stone is one of the stand-out moments on the record. It has an old-school Country feel about it and the stirring guitar riffs evoke days gone by. It\u2019s one of the moments on the album where Timmins really fleshes out the production, making the whole song sound rather epic. Tomorrow in My Mind is the closer and it\u2019s a mid-tempo number that brings the record to a satisfying conclusion.\n\nWhere I\u2019d perhaps criticise the record is that there isn\u2019t a huge amount of variety. I admire and respect Leger\u2019s abilities a songwriter and storyteller but there are moments where the music, as enjoyable as it is, passes you by without grabbing you. This is in part due to the familiar sounds that each track carries and there\u2019s no moment where Leger really pushes out of his comfort zone.\n\nTime Out For Tomorrow will definitely appeal to fans of the traditional Americana sound. Leger is the real deal and his music drips with authenticity. He also has plenty to say and the more you listen to these tracks, the more they\u2019ll grow on you. For me, it\u2019s not an instant album and it takes a little work to get to the heart of it. If you\u2019re prepared to put in the time and effort, you\u2019ll find yourself rewarded.\n\n\ufeff\n\nTrack list: 1. Canvas of Gold 2. Justine 3. That Ain\u2019t Here 4. Tell a Lie 5.

He started releasing his albums on vinyl as early as 2010\u2019s Travelling Grey.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been buying vinyl since I was a little kid,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first album I bought when I was eight was John Lennon\u2019s Mind Games album. When I was about five or six, my Dad gave me a stack of records and a record player, and that started me off. I love records. There\u2019s just something about it that you don\u2019t get from listening to stuff digitally. It\u2019s hard to hand down files to your kids. I like listening to albums from start to finish.\u201d\n\nJerry\u2019s debut album was released in 2005 when he was still a teenager. He admitted that he often felt like an outsider while coming of age in Toronto\u2019s East End.\n\n\u201cGrowing up and still living in the East End of Toronto you\u2019re very separated from where the action is, and those scenes,\u201d he said. I remember feeling very kind of not part of people\u2019s treehouses, or on the outside looking in when I would go downtown. I was never in the cool groups. I was never invited into those circles. I always felt very separated from that living in the East End.\u201d\n\nBut Jerry\u2019s love of music would force him out of his comfort zone resulting in him sneaking into Toronto bars to perform when he was just 17 years old. It also resulted in him meeting another eastender, producer and musician Tim Bovaconti, who ended up opening a lot of doors for the artist. Tim would go on to produce or co-produce Jerry\u2019s first five albums.\n\nJerry\u2019s East End lifestyle did lead to a chance meeting with another famous Canadian artist.\n\n\u201cRon (Sexsmith) used to live in the East End,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first time I met him was when I was working at Home Hardware and he would come in, and of course, I knew who he was. I gave him a demo CD, and he actually listened to it and liked it and gave some cool feedback.\u201d\n\nRon Sexsmith would end up performing on Jerry\u2019s sophomore album 2006\u2019s Farewell Ghost Town and again on 2012\u2019s Some Folks Know.\n\nJerry\u2019s incredibly tight backing band is known as the Situation. Jerry\u2019s high school friend, drummer Kyle Sullivan, appeared on his debut album and has remained a member of the Situation ever since. By Jerry\u2019s third album, 2008\u2019s You, Me and the Horse, Jerry and Kyle were joined by guitarist James McKie and bassist Dan Mock, forming the lineup that remains over twelve years later.\n\nJerry explained, \u201cWe\u2019re friends and we get along. That\u2019s a big part of it. We\u2019re all invested in a way in bringing something honest, whatever \u2018honest\u2019 means. Maybe the word \u2018honest\u2019 isn\u2019t honest, but whatever \u2018honest\u2019 means, in what we\u2019re doing, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to bring to people. And I think we all personally get off on that. Especially when other people get into it.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that when I caught Jerry and the Situation\u2019s late-night set on the closing night of the second annual Troubadour Festival in Barrie, ON last month, I saw a well-oiled machine that continues to enjoy playing music together and playing music in front of an audience. The band\u2019s set included several songs from Jerry\u2019s forthcoming album Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nUnlike 2017\u2019s double LP Nonsense and Heartache, Time Out \u2026 isn\u2019t a concept album, Jerry said.\n\n\u201cYou let the music go in whatever direction it wants to go for that time period. The next record, I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to sound like. I don\u2019t think always under the same umbrella. Some songs are more observational. Some songs have a piece of my life in it just \u2019cause you can\u2019t always help it.\u201d\n\nTogether with producer Michael Timmins (Cowboy Junkies), Jerry and his band would record 20 songs, finally settling on 10 that would form the album version. Most of the songs were written specifically for Time Out For Tomorrow, with the exception of \u201cTell A Lie.\u201d While it was originally recorded during 2017\u2019s Nonsense and Heartache sessions, Jerry didn\u2019t feel that it fit the concept for that album. Thankfully, when it came time to record his next album, he found the right place for the song and re-recorded it for Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nThe last song to be written for Time Out For Tomorrow would turn out to be the first track on the album, \u201cCanvas Of Gold,\u201d a beautiful, well-crafted song that perfectly sets the tone for the entire album.\n\n\u201cBurchell Lake\u201d was inspired by Ghost Towns of Ontario: Field Guide Vol. 2., a book by Canadian author Ron Brown. The song is about the town of Burchell Lake, an actual ghost town located southwest of Thunder Bay, ON.\n\n\u201cNobody knows Ontario like Ron Brown,\u201d Jerry explained. He\u2019d owned the book for several years and, while he hasn\u2019t been able to visit Burchell Lake, it did inspire him to embark on a ghost town road trip down Highway 7 all the way to Ottawa a few years ago.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate enough to own five of Jerry Leger\u2019s albums, and after listening to Time Out For Tomorrow, I felt compelled to listen to his previous albums to try and hear if and how Jerry has evolved as a songwriter and performer.\n\nIn my opinion, Jerry Leger\u2019s greatest strength is his songwriting. It\u2019s been strong for years and Time Out For Tomorrow is another great example of that strength. It features lyrics and arrangements that don\u2019t feel the least bit contrived or formulaic. Jerry chooses not to be constricted by rigid song structure, in favour of letting the feel of the song dictate how it will unfold. The result is a fantastic album that easily engages the listener from start to finish.\n\nI certainly lost myself during Jerry Leger\u2019s Troubadour Festival set and again when I previewed my advance copy of his forthcoming album. If you\u2019re looking to escape into honest stories told through song I\u2019d highly recommend Jerry Leger and the Situation\u2019s Time Out For Tomorrow.\n\nIf you are enjoying this content, please take a second to support Roots Music Canada on Patreon!"}, {"url": "https://jerryleger.com/now-available-songs-from-the-apartment-on-red-vinyl-time-out-for-tomorrow-deluxe-edition/", "page_content": "Hey gang,\n\nHappy to tell you that the (red) vinyl release of Songs From The Apartment and deluxe edition of Time Out For Tomorrow have now been released and are ready to be shipped to your door.
