{"Merle Oberon was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Dark Angel in 1935.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/merle-oberon-oscars-best-actress", "page_content": "Magazine writers didn\u2019t know what to make of Merle Oberon when she took Hollywood by storm in the 1930s. One writer described her as \u201cbizarre, bewildering, and different\u201d, while others marveled at her \u201cdelicate\u201d oval face, \u201celoquent\u201d emerald eyes, \u201cbright red lips\u201d and \u201calabaster\u201d skin.\n\nThough her 1936 best actress Oscar nomination for the coming-of-age drama The Dark Angel affirmed her place in a league with Katharine Hepburn and the eventual winner, Bette Davis, the glamor paragons of the day, it was only later that the world discovered Oberon was a south Asian woman passing for white.\n\nGiven the way Everything Everywhere All at Once has dominated this awards season, it seems increasingly likely that Michelle Yeoh will take home this year\u2019s best actress prize. But when Yeoh\u2019s name was announced among the best actress nominees for this year\u2019s Academy Awards in late January, the Hollywood Reporter was at pains to call the veteran actor \u201cthe first person who identifies as Asian to ever be nominated for the award\u201d.\n\nLaurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in Wuthering Heights. Photograph: United Artists/Allstar\n\nCritics condemned the declaration as too politically correct, even as it captured the complex tie that binds these women, each a product of her time. Where the 60-year-old Yeoh is a butt-kicking film pioneer on the brink of smashing a cultural ceiling for playing a role originally written for Jackie Chan, Oberon carefully hid her true identity to evade certain racial persecution and took that secret to her grave. It wasn\u2019t until decades after her death in 1979 at age 68 that the world learned her truth. That, not Oberon\u2019s eye-opening work in The Dark Angel, is what should rightly be hailed as her signature performance.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the story of racial representation,\u201d says Shilpa Dav\u00e9, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, \u201cMerle Oberon is a really important part. She brings a global aspect to it, the shades of brown.\u201d\n\nBorn Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in what was then the British Indian city of Bombay, Oberon was determined to make the most of her innately fairer complexion. It became her ticket to a bigger world, the shroud that helped disguise the fact that she was the product of rape. Her birth father was the Anglo-Irish foreman of a tea plantation. Her mother, believed to have been of Sri Lankan and M\u0101ori ancestry, was just 14 when she gave birth in 1911. After centuries of intermixing, babies born from biracial relationships had evolved into a quiet shame \u2013 shunned by Britons and Indians alike.\n\nThe family nicknamed Oberon \u201cQueenie\u201d, as her birth coincided with Queen Mary and King George\u2019s visit to India. In an attempt to soften Oberon\u2019s lot in life, her grandmother raised her as her own and convinced her that her teenage mother was actually her half sister. But that wasn\u2019t enough to shield Oberon from the relentless taunts over her mixed heritage. At the age of three, after a cross-country move to Calcutta, she won a scholarship to one of the city\u2019s best all-girls private schools, only for classmates to drive her out with their overt racism. Films and the nightlife scene became her escape, and playing pretend key to her survival.\n\nMerle Oberon and Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel. Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Alamy\n\nIn adolescence, Oberon began honing a posh accent and lightening her skin with bleach creams loaded with ammoniated mercury \u2013 a dangerous poison that had more of a weakening effect on Oberon\u2019s many male suitors. Those who didn\u2019t dump her outright after discovering her race helped sponsor her moves from India to France and England, where she worked for a time as a club hostess under the name Queenie O\u2019Brien. When she became romantically involved with the Hungarian-born British director Alexander Korda, Oberon\u2019s acting career clicked into high gear.\n\nA bit part as Anne Boleyn in the 1933 blockbuster The Private Life of Henry VIII announced her breakout. A mad scramble to come up with a cover story for the actor credited as \u201cMerle Oberon\u201d ensued. She told people she had been born in Tasmania \u201cbecause it was so far from the US and Europe and generally considered to be \u2018British\u2019 to its core\u201d, wrote Mar\u00e9e Delofski, director of the 2002 documentary The Trouble with Merle. (In her lifetime, Oberon visited Australia twice.) Oberon claimed her birth records had been destroyed in a fire. (Her half-brother, Harry, would discover them in Bombay, now Mumbai, after her death.) As for her much darker-skinned mother \u2013 her biological grandmother \u2013 Oberon presented her as a maid.\n\nSuch was the cost of making it in show business at a time when the US government was keen to crack down on indecency. Rather than leave it up to lawmakers, Hollywood seized on the opportunity to police itself, adopting a set of rules known as the Hays Code \u2013 which, among many other things, frowned upon interracial romance. With representational casting essentially made illegal, studios embraced yellow and blackface. And when Oberon\u2019s early work with Korda, whom she eventually married, led to a successful career under Samuel Goldwyn, it became in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep her identity a mystery. \u201cThink about it,\u201d says Dav\u00e9. \u201cShe was part of this cadre of actors and actresses that were loaned out to make all these movies. She was dependent on Goldwyn and Korda for her livelihood. I can see why she had to hide in that way. She had no power.\u201d\n\nNot even the 1936 best actress nomination brought Oberon any extra clout. For a start, the Oscars were barely a decade old and not yet the gold standard award. For another, the media was even tougher on female actors than they are now and held Oberon up for extra scrutiny.\n\nOberon gets a tip as she leaves for Royal Ascot, in a 1950 photo in London. Photograph: Norman Vigars/Getty Images\n\nOne critic derided Oberon\u2019s performance in the 1934 action film The Scarlet Pimpernel, citing a \u201ctendency to strongly orientalize her appearance by means of facial makeup and the slant of black brows\u201d. When a 1934 Los Angeles Times story used the term \u201cEuro-Asian\u201d to describe her, Oberon dismissed it as a coincidence. In an ad campaign for Max Factor, the cosmetics brand bragged about how its makeup turned her from \u201cslightly unreal and exotic\u201d to a \u201cbeautiful, charming girl\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that she would be Oscar nominated for The Dark Angel, a film about a first world war love affair that is complicated when the male protagonist suffers a battle injury that costs him his eyesight. Strangely, it was Oberon\u2019s only nomination, even as Hepburn and Davis became Oscar perennials and Oberon kept working into the early 70s. She starred opposite Laurence Olivier in 1939\u2019s Wuthering Heights and as herself in 1966\u2019s The Oscar, which is about the awards.\n\nStill, she soldiered on in spite of the damage she\u2019d caused to her skin from so much bleach cream and a car accident that left her disfigured and forced Korda to abandon production of the epic I, Claudius. To keep the cracks in Oberon\u2019s white facade from surfacing on screen, the cinematographer Lucien Ballard developed a special camera light for her to obscure her facial scars. This was after \u201cLady Korda\u201d had divorced her knighted director husband to marry Ballard.\n\nOn her downslope, Oberon reveled in her grand dame status, regaling magazine reporters with her true Hollywood stories, when she wasn\u2019t making the odd cameo on the game show What\u2019s My Line? or presenting a special achievement award to the Poseidon Adventure at the 1973 Oscars. Even then Charlton Heston called her \u201ca lady whose beauty is not only a legend, but a reality\u201d.\n\nBut even as times changed and Hollywood\u2019s aversion toward race mixing on screen began to relax, Oberon remained committed to her lie and quickly tightened up when it unraveled. When her nephew Michael Korda, then editor-in-chief at Simon and Schuster, tried to write a biography on Oberon, he says, she threatened to sue him and cut him out of her will if he used real details. So he turned it into the roman-\u00e0-clef Queenie, which became an ABC miniseries.\n\nAccording to the Australian historian Cassandra Pybus, a visit to Hobart in 1978 turned awkward for Oberon when officials couldn\u2019t find proof that she had been born in Tasmania. After confirming as much, Oberon ducked reporters and skipped a ceremony at a theater named in her honor before quietly returning home.\n\nA year later, she died in Malibu from a stroke."}, {"url": "https://ew.com/awards/oscars/merle-oberon-tragic-history-first-asian-woman-oscar-nominated-best-actress/", "page_content": "The tragic history of the first Asian woman nominated for Best Actress, over 85 years before Michelle Yeoh\n\nWhen Michelle Yeoh was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar for Everything Everywhere All at Once, the overdue honor came with an appalling statistic: Yeoh is the first Asian woman to be nominated in the category in over 85 years.\n\nThe first was a person who did not acknowledge her own heritage, but instead passed for white, biracial actress Merle Oberon, nominated for the 1935 drama The Dark Angel.\n\n\"Merle was in a very different Hollywood,\" says Halley Bondy, who researched and guest-narrated the You Must Remember This podcast episode Passing for White: Merle Oberon. \"Merle was in a Hollywood where you had to be white in order to be accepted, in order to win awards, in order to get prestigious roles. Michelle's nomination, aside from the fact that it took forever, is so refreshing to see. We're in a new Hollywood, where Asian cinema is celebrated, and Asian actresses are celebrated. People don't have to hide anymore.\"\n\nMerle Oberon (1911-1979), British actress, poses with a bouquet of flowers, with flowers in her hair, in a studio portrait, circa 1940.

While Yeoh has earned her nod for a project that centers on and celebrates her identity as a Chinese woman, Oberon got hers for The Dark Angel, a film in which she plays a member of the British aristocracy, Kitty Vane, who is caught in a love triangle with two close friends, the dashing Alan Trent (Fredric March) and the kindly Gerald Shannon (Herbert Marshall). There's no trace of her Asian background or even the exoticism that frequently played a role in her image as a movie star. She's the image of British propriety, clipped accent and all.\n\nIn real life, her identity was as much a performance as the one that earned her an Oscar nomination. Though she claimed she was from Tasmania, Australia, throughout her career, Oberon was born in India to a Sri Lankan mother and Anglo-Irish father. Her family line also included M\u0101ori ancestry. Further complicating matters, Charlotte, the woman Oberon called her mother, was actually her grandmother. Oberon was, in fact, the child of her then 12-year-old half-sister, Constance.\n\nOberon seemed to have some sense of the pitfalls of her blurry identity from a young age, growing up in poverty and bullied at school for her mixed ethnicity. \"She started [passing] as a teenager,\" says Bondy. \"She would do posh British accents and she would try to emulate the British colonizers. But she didn't belong either in either world. She didn't really belong with the elite, and she didn't belong in a traditional Indian country.\"\n\n1943: Leading lady Merle Oberon (1911 - 1979) as she appears in the film 'First Comes Courage', a war drama directed by Dorothy Arzner. (Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images) Credit: Hulton Archive/Getty\n\nOberon moved to Britain when she was 17, and it was film producer (and her eventual husband), Alexander Korda, who helped complete her transformation into a white-passing actress. Born Estelle Merle O'Brien Thompson and using the nickname \"Queenie,\" she was rechristened Merle Oberon by Korda, who cast her in as Anne Boleyn in 1933's The Private Life of Henry VIII.\n\nFrom there, Korda and Hollywood producer Samuel Goldwyn, who purchased shares of Oberon's contract from Korda, continued to mold her into a star. This included the use of a skin bleaching product that contained high levels of poisonous ammoniated mercury. \"They made her last name Oberon to make it seem obscure and vague,\" says Bondy. \"She was unplaceable. Korda helped construct that identity and that look. I don't know if he applied the makeup. I don't know if he was the one who was like, 'You need to look more white.' But I have to assume that since he had so much control over her early film career, he probably played a huge role in that.\"\n\nOberon herself was obsessed with maintaining the illusion of whiteness, even having a portrait of her late \"mother,\" Charlotte, painted with lighter-colored skin. Before Charlotte's death, when traveling together, Oberon passed the older woman off as her maid to avoid anyone questioning her origins.\n\nIt wasn't abnormal for movie stars to undergo physical transformations at the behest of studios, and often, it was done with the aim of obscuring their origins (Rita Hayworth famously endured electrolysis to raise her hairline and reduce the visibility of her Spanish heritage). But Oberon went to further extremes, lying about her place of birth and lightening her skin color.\n\nFredric March looking into the eyes of Merle Oberon in a scene from the film 'The Dark Angel', 1935. (Photo by United Artists/Getty Images) Credit: United Artists/Getty\n\n\"She was billed as exotic, and that was something that they leaned into in constructing her image,\" adds Bondy. \"Exotic was acceptable, but to pinpoint her as half-M\u0101ori and Sri Lankan would've been too much. They all liked the image of her being vague \u2014 'Oh, she's from Tasmania,' which nobody knows anything about. She had to live her whole life that way. She never really did have that triumphant moment of coming out and being proud. That was what the studios did. They doctored you into whatever they wanted. If you had talent and presence, they could make you white.\"\n\nThere were Asian actors open about their race during that time, most notably Anna May Wong. But their opportunities in mainstream Hollywood were limited \u2014 and they were even denied roles that aligned with their race in favor of white actors in yellowface. Oberon's beauty allowed her to perpetuate the lie that enabled her to flourish in a more explicitly racist film industry than today's.\n\n\"She was very convincing and opportunistic,\" explains Bondy. \"She'd been that way her whole life. She learned grit and how to get things from men from her mother. So she had a chance of passing, and the chance of winning white American hearts.\" Had she embraced her identity, Bondy adds, Oberon never would've been hired by Samuel Goldwyn, much less been nominated for an Oscar.\n\nFredric March holding Merle Oberon by the window in a scene from the film 'The Dark Angel', 1935. (Photo by United Artists/Getty Images) Credit: United Artists/Getty\n\nBondy claims that The Dark Angel is the film in which Oberon looks the whitest, and certainly, if you compare images of her from earlier projects, there is a noticeable difference.\n\nArguably, Oberon gives her greatest performance as Cathy opposite Laurence Olivier's Heathcliff in the 1939 adaptation of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. But by that time, Hollywood had grown suspicious of her. Rumors swirled that she'd been a high-class prostitute, and because her British accent slipped regularly, many began to wonder about her origins.\n\n\"Wuthering Heights was one of the biggest movies of the year, with a huge budget and nominated for all kinds of awards,\" says Bondy. \"Merle was not nominated that year. Given how Hollywood operated and who got nominated for these awards, there was no earthly reason why she wouldn't get nominated. So you have to think that she wasn't entirely welcome into the Hollywood elite.\"\n\nBy this time, Oberon had also suffered serious damage to her face, both the result of a 1937 car accident and the long-term impact of the bleaching creams and makeups, which resulted in pitting and indentation. The damage was extensive enough that cinematographer Lucien Ballard designed a special light to obscure the blemishes and scars and lend her a luminous glamor. To this day, the light is referred to as an \"Obie,\" in reference to her last name.\n\nTHE OSCAR, Merle Oberon, 1966 Credit: Everett\n\nAs she aged, Oberon maintained a complicated relationship with her identity. Her final film grappled with the issue: Interval, released in 1973 and produced by Oberon herself, gave her a role as a woman who didn't know the truth of her own origins and tried to outrun them.\n\nA few years later in 1978, Oberon was invited to Hobart, Tasmania, her long-purported birthplace, for a mayoral reception and the naming of a theater in her honor. Oberon traveled there for the tribute, but at the reception, she denied she'd been born in Tasmania and refused to attend any other planned events on her itinerary.\n\n\"I think that she was just starting to reckon with everything,\" says Bondy of that ill-fated trip. \"We'll never know if she truly ever reckoned with it. But she grew up not just having to conform, but probably believing on some level that she was inferior. She was deeply uncomfortable with [who she was]. Because when you're beaten over the head with racism nonstop, you probably internalize it to some degree.\"\n\nThe truth of Oberon's origins was never disclosed in her lifetime, and she died in 1979 at the age of 68 still maintaining that she was white. It wasn't until the publication of a biography in 1983, Princess Merle: The Romantic Life of Merle Oberon, that the truth was revealed to the public when the authors located her birth records in India, where she was born in 1911.\n\nAlan Trent (Fredric March) and Kitty Vane (Merle Oberon) embracing in The Dark Angel.

Since Michelle Yeoh was first announced as an Oscar nominee, Oberon's name has recirculated with the designation as the first Asian to compete for Best Actress, a record many have disputed because of her obfuscation of her identity.\n\nYeoh herself has been careful to credit the women and pioneers on whose shoulders she now stands. Should that include Merle Oberon?\n\n\"Absolutely, she belongs in that pantheon,\" says Bondy. \"She was a real pioneer even though nobody really knew that at the time. And she probably didn't think about it at the time because her race was shameful [to her].\"\n\nBut what would Oberon make of her place in the history books, and the fact that it took almost 90 years for another Asian woman, this one vociferously proud of her identity and the ways it has shaped her on-screen presence, to get an Oscar nomination?\n\n\"I think she would be stunned to learn that her origin is actually an asset,\" speculates Bondy. \"She would have a lot to wrestle with, because she was very disconnected from reality. She would need a lot of therapy. But I think that she would ultimately be very proud and embrace it, because she loved the spotlight.\""}, {"url": "https://people.com/movies/merle-oberon-first-asian-best-actress-oscar-nominee-who-hid-her-heritage-from-hollywood/", "page_content": "Before Michelle Yeoh made history as the second Best Actress Academy Award nominee of Asian heritage, there was Merle Oberon.\n\nBorn in India, Oberon is perhaps best known for her roles in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934) and 1935's The Dark Angel \u2014 the latter of which nabbed her a Best Actress nod in 1936, making her the first Asian woman to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, Yeoh, 60, just received her first-ever Oscar nomination for Best Actress, for her role in Everything Everywhere All at Once \u2014 making her the second actress of Asian descent to hold the honor, 87 years later.\n\nRead on to learn more about Oberon's life, career and legacy.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nFrom left: Merle Oberon in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934) and The Dark Angel (1935).

Born in Bombay to a Sri Lankan-Maori mother and white father, Oberon grew up in poverty in Calcutta.

In a bid to succeed in an industry that often spurned people of color, especially women of color, Oberon obscured her birthplace and biracial identity. Casting of non-White actors was not only unpopular, but it was also in many cases effectively banned under a set of self-enforced industry rules known as the Hays Code, which, among other things, prohibited interracial romance.\n\n\"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" collected 11 nominations for the 95th Academy Awards. The ceremony will air on ABC on March 12. (Video: Allie Caren/The Washington Post)\n\nOberon, born Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson, was raised in India and started to reinvent herself in the shroud of nightlife in what was then called Bombay. She began wearing white makeup \u2014 then a popular tool for other mixed-race Indian women \u2014 and acquired a British accent. She also used skin-bleaching products, which employ chemicals to suppress the concentration of melanin that makes skin appear darker, according to the podcast \u201cYou Must Remember This.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe guise continued when she moved to Britain. Oberon took her grandmother, Charlotte Selby, with her and had Selby pose as her maid. Selby was originally thought to be Oberon\u2019s mother, but it was later revealed that her mother was the woman said to be Oberon\u2019s sister, who was a teenager when Oberon was conceived, according to the journalist Halley Bondy, who chronicled Oberon\u2019s life on the podcast.\n\nOberon told people she was born in Tasmania, the far-flung Australian island state. Her birth records? Destroyed in a fire, she would tell people. Oberon claimed that she moved to India after her British father died. She said that was where her \u201cexotic\u201d nature came from, according to Halley.\n\nHer big break as an actress came after she caught the eye of Hungarian filmmaker Alexander Korda, who cast her as Anne Boleyn in the 1933 film \u201cThe Private Life of Henry VIII.\u201d She was nominated for the 1936 Oscar for best actress for her role as Kitty Vane in \u201cThe Dark Angel,\u201d which chronicled a World War I-era love triangle between Oberon and two soldiers. But she was perhaps best known for her starring role as Cathy in the 1939 film \u201cWuthering Heights,\u201d produced by Samuel Goldwyn.\n\nOberon\u2019s facade lasted after her death, in 1979, until a 1983 biography, \u201cPrincess Merle: The Romantic Life of Merle Oberon,\u201d revealed her origins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe jig was up, but Oberon got a long, storied career and died with her secret intact. For years, even after her guise had dissolved, Tasmanians held her up as a daughter of the island.\n\nAnd so, with only her family and close confidants aware of her true identity in 1936, it was probable that she was nominated for best actress in 1936 as a White woman.

Subscribe\n\nMichelle Yeoh made history this week as the first Asian-identifying nominee for the Best Actress Academy Award. But film historians and fans were quick to bring up Merle Oberon, the 1930s leading lady with her own hidden Asian background.\n\nOberon was a South Asian actress with multiracial heritage \u2014 she had an English father and a mother with Sri Lankan and M\u0101ori ancestry. Oberon rose in the motion picture industry of the 1930s, initially playing characters defined by their Eastern origins before being rebranded as a high-class English actress.\n\nShe was actually born in Bombay. Oberon began acting in France, before continuing in the United Kingdom and eventually making her way to Hollywood.\n\nThe controversy over her origins was a byproduct of British colonialism, according to Academy Awards expert and UCLA doctoral candidate Monica R. Sandler. Oberon was stuck in an awkward middle ground when it came to how she was cast in films.\n\n\u201cWhen she tried to be in white spaces, she was rejected,\u201d Sandler said. \u201cBefore she was in France or anything, people would find out who she was, and that she was a mixed-race individual. This did not go well for her.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Cover Story\n\nCirca 1939: Merle Oberon seen dining with Clark Gable. (General Photographic Agency / Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nThere was widespread speculation about Oberon\u2019s origins at the time, but she had a fabricated history she would share when asked.\n\n\u201cShe always had this story that she was from Tasmania,\u201d Sandler said. \u201cHistorically, she\u2019d been there two or three times in her life \u2014 including after she was already saying that.\u201d\n\nThe story made Oberon popular with Australians, who saw her as one of their own, according to Sandler.\n\n\u201cBut there were moments where they would ask her about growing up in Tasmania. And she\u2019d be like, \u2018uhhh\u2026\u2019\u201d Sandler said.\n\nThe parts she played helped to back up her cover \u2014 as Babli Sinha notes in a 2016 issue of the academic Journal of Popular Film and Television, Oberon was playing roles both on- and off-screen.\n\n\u201cThrough her performances, Oberon was also trying to render herself opaque in the wake of doubts regarding her claims of whiteness,\u201d Sinha writes.\n\nThat cover story would change over time, according to Sandler.\n\n\n\nThe Transformation\n\nCirca 1935 photo of Merle Oberon. (Hulton Archive / Getty Images)\n\nEarly on, Oberon played several parts that were considered \"exotic\" (a description common at the time for non-white characters), but she played just one specifically Asian character: Marquise Morasaka in the film Thunder In The East.\n\nA year later, movie mogul Samuel Goldwyn decided to reshape her image when he cast her in Dark Angel, her first lead role. (She earned a Best Actress nomination for that film, but ultimately lost to Bette Davis.)\n\n\u201cShe was able to transform herself,\u201d Sandler said.\n\nIn the publicity for Dark Angel, Oberon pushed the narrative that she\u2019d used makeup to play non-white races in earlier parts. In a 1935 interview with Picture-Play Magazine, she claimed that she was being allowed to be her real self now.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m terrible, I shall have to go back to my wigs and gold paint,\u201d Oberon said, claiming that this was what she used in her previous roles. \u201cIt seems to me that how I screen is more or less a make-up problem. \u2026 With each succeeding picture it was accentuated more.\u201d\n\n\u201c[She] talks about how she\u2019s been playing these parts where she looks a certain way, and people have perceived her as being this way, but she\u2019s really this high-class British woman,\u201d Sandler said.\n\n\n\nHollywood\u2019s Racial Ban\n\nCirca 1938: Actress Merle Oberon sharing a milkshake with Joel McCrea, '30s/'40s athletic American hero. (Hulton Archive / Getty Images)\n\nOberon came from a hard background, according to Sandler. The woman who she thought was her mother was actually her grandmother \u2014 the woman she thought was her sister, 12 years old at the time of her birth, was her actual mother.\n\n\u201cAt that time, there wasn\u2019t much of an option for her,\u201d Sandler said.\n\nOne reason that\u2019s the case: the Motion Picture Production Code, aka the Hays Code. The limitations at the time included a ban on depicting interracial relationships.\n\n\u201cDuring this period of time, if she\u2019d been openly Asian, she wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to be in a lead role,\u201d Sandler said.\n\nSuch rules sharply curtailed the career of L.A.'s Anna May Wong, who struggled to find roles that were not stereotypical. As early as 1933, Wong told an interviewer she was tired of the roles she was offered in Hollywood.\n\nMost of the information about her true origins didn\u2019t come out until after she died, Sandler noted.\n\nOberon\u2019s full reasons for keeping her background hidden aren\u2019t known, but speculation has included a combination of doing so to get ahead as an actress, along with fraught feelings about her family of origin.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised to say that someone coming from poverty does not really want to reflect on coming from poverty,\u201d Sandler said. \u201cShe\u2019s coming from this really, really complicated place in this really complicated historical moment.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhite Women Playing Asian Leads\n\nActress Merle Oberon sitting in a crinoline dress, relaxing during the filming \"Lady X\" at Denham Studios, England, on Aug. 4, 1937. (Keystone / Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nSandler juxtaposed Oberon with actress Luise Rainer, \u201cwho is this notorious example of, I would say, the most shameful Academy Award win in history,\u201d Sandler said.\n\nRainer was the white actress who would win an Academy Award for 1937\u2019s The Good Earth, in which she played a Chinese farmer in yellowface \u2014 the makeup technique used to make a white person appear Asian. There's been an ongoing discussion about how that part should have gone to Anna May Wong, according to Sandler.\n\nBut she wasn't strongly considered for the role and was relegated to a secondary part. That's because the film\u2019s lead was white actor Paul Muni, and due to the Production Code, his lead actress couldn\u2019t be played by an actual Asian woman, Sandler noted.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of yellowface nominations during this period,\u201d Sandler said.\n\nThe 1987 TV miniseries Queenie was loosely inspired by Oberon, based on a novel by writer Michael Korda, who was Oberon\u2019s nephew. (Her first marriage was to Alexander Korda, a prominent director, screenwriter, and producer.) The lead character in Queenie was played by\u2026 Mia Sara, a white actress.\n\n\u201cThere are these figures who were passing in Hollywood during that period, who completely transformed where they came from,\u201d Sandler said.\n\nThe most successful of the time was likely Rita Hayworth, Sandler noted, who changed her name from Margarita Carmen Cansino in the process of obscuring her Romani Hispanic background.\n\n\n\nToday\n\nNow, nearly 90 years later, a lead actress nominee can finally claim her own Asian heritage."}, {"url": "https://walkoffame.com/merle-oberon/", "page_content": "Merle Oberon\n\nMerle Oberon was an Indian-born British actress.\n\nShe began her film career in British films, and a prominent role, as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII, brought her attention.

British and American film actress Merle Oberon appeared in more than 30 motion pictures. Her most notable portrayal was that of the beautiful Cathy, who tormented and rejected Heathcliff (played by Laurence Olivier ) in the 1939 classic Wuthering Heights .\n\nIn the early 20th century prejudice and discrimination against non-white or mixed-race people was common in the Western world. This was particularly true in Hollywood , where white actors were often cast in Asian roles. In addition, Asian people were often stereotyped as villains or as inferior to white people. In order to get work as an actress, Oberon kept her Asian heritage hidden. She claimed to have been born on the Australian island of Tasmania, a former British colony. She said that she went to live with godparents in India after her father, a British army officer, died.\n\nOberon was born Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson on February 19, 1911, in Bombay (now Mumbai), India. Her father was a British railway engineer working in India. Her mother was partly of Sinhalese (from what is now Sri Lanka ) and partly of M\u0101ori descent. Her mother was young when she gave birth to Oberon, and Oberon was raised by her grandmother. The family led Oberon to believe that her grandmother was her mother and her biological mother was her sister. Oberon\u2019s father died when she was young, and the rest of the family moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1917. There in 1920 Oberon became involved with the Calcutta Amateur Theatrical Society. In 1928 she moved to London, England, to pursue acting. Her grandmother, who had darker skin, went with her as her maid.\n\nActing Career\n\nIn London, Oberon worked as a hostess in a nightclub. She also began accepting small, largely uncredited parts in both silent and talking movies. The director and producer Alexander Korda suggested that she use the stage name Merle Oberon. He gave Oberon her big break when he cast her in the role of Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). In the film she starred opposite Charles Laughton and earned praise for her portrayal of the second wife of England\u2019s King Henry VIII. In 1934 Oberon played opposite popular actors Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., in The Private Life of Don Juan and Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel.\n\nOberon then moved to the United States to begin an acting career in Hollywood. She first costarred with Maurice Chevalier in the musical comedy Folies Berg\u00e8re de Paris (1935). That same year she costarred with Fredric March in the drama The Dark Angel. Oberon portrayed a woman who believes the man she loves was killed during World War I. She was nominated for an Academy Award in 1936 for best actress for that role. She thus became the first actor of Asian descent to be nominated for an Oscar. However, that record was not revealed until after her death in 1979, when her true heritage was discovered.\n\nIn 1937 Oberon was in an automobile accident that left her with scars on her face. However, with makeup and special lighting, she was able to continue her career in movies. She worked steadily through the late 1940s. Besides Wuthering Heights, her movies of note from that time include A Song to Remember (1945), in which Oberon portrayed French writer George Sand.\n\nOberon\u2019s career then began to slow down. Her later films include the romantic comedy Pardon My French (1951), the historical drama D\u00e9sir\u00e9e (1954), and the crime drama The Price of Fear (1956). Her last screen appearances were in the dramas Hotel (1967) and Interval (1973). Oberon died on November 23, 1979, in Los Angeles, California."}, {"url": "https://www.mic.com/articles/168949/the-surprising-story-of-merle-oberon-the-only-indian-actress-to-be-nominated-for-an-oscar", "page_content": "When the omniscient narrator read Dev Patel's name during the 89th annual Academy Awards nominations announcement in January, the actor extended an incredible record. He became just the 13th Asian actor ever nominated for an Oscar, and the third of Indian descent.\n\nThe second was Ben Kingsley, the British actor of Gujarati Indian lineage on his father's side. The first, however, was the only Indian actress ever nominated for an Oscar: Merle Oberon. But had Hollywood had its way, as it did most of her life, we likely never would have known she was Indian at all.\n\nAP\n\nOberon was born Estelle Merle O'Brien Thompson in 1911. For most of her life, she claimed she was born in Australia \u2014 but in fact, she was born in Mumbai. Her mother was Constance Selby, a 15-year-old girl from Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka), but because Constance was so young, her mother Charlotte Selby raised Oberon as her own.\n\nShe moved to England in 1928, and quickly caught the attention of Hungarian director Alexander Korda. Korda cast her as Anne Boleyn in his 1933 film The Private Life of Henry VIII, crediting her under the name Merle Oberon. The role would become her breakout, boosting her professional and personal life. Films like The Scarlet Pimpernel, I, Claudius and Wuthering Heights filled her filmography; she earned her Oscar nomination for 1935's The Dark Angel. Simultaneously, Oberon embarked on a marriage with Korda, which would end in 1945. She married thrice more before passing away in 1979. Her last film was 1973's Interval.\n\nWhile working, Oberon reportedly refused to appear on camera without makeup \u2014 now understood to be about masking her darker complexion. She died without revealing the truth of her identity. It wasn't until the publication of her 1983 biography, written by Charles Higham, that her ancestry came to light.\n\nAP\n\nWhy did Oberon and Korda go to such lengths to mask her identity? The answer is simple: Hollywood at the time wouldn't have allowed it.\n\nIn 2002, the Australian Broadcast Company aired a documentary titled The Trouble With Merle. The documentary was an exploration of Oberon's identity as it relates to her celebrity. In the director's notes, helmer Mar\u00e9e Delofski wrote that her heritage wouldn't have found a home on film:\n\nIn the movies at that time, a woman of mixed race was not acceptable. The racism of the period made it very explicit: Merle's Anglo-Indian background was a major obstacle to her becoming a star. Tasmania was chosen as her new birthplace because it was so far from the USA and Europe and was generally considered to be \"British\" to its core. So Estelle Thompson from Bombay became Merle Oberon, a white upper class Hobart girl who moves to India from Tasmania after her distinguished father dies in a hunting accident.\n\nOberon was hardly the only actress working in that era to blur racial lines. John Gavin, born John Anthony Golenor Pablos, consistently played white characters before he became President Ronald Reagan's ambassador to Mexico later in life. Raquel Welch was Bolivian, and refused to change her name to something more palatable for white audiences. Light-skinned black actress Fredi Washington actually used makeup to look darker-skinned on film.\n\nBut Oberon is perhaps the most famous example of disguised ancestry in Hollywood. How much she knew is up for debate; Delofski has questions about how much was her work and how much Hollywood (and Korda) designed for her.\n\n\"Maybe Merle didn't even know who her mother was,\" the director said. \"The studio reconstructed her history and she had to live that life story and keep living that life story.\"\n\nAP\n\nHollywood has changed in the intervening years, though some vestiges of that stigma remain. Sisters Meg and Jennifer Tilly go by their mother's maiden name rather than their Chinese father's. In other ways, the world has opened: For example, actors like Hailee Steinfeld and Darren Criss speak openly about their part-Filipino heritage.\n\nOberon, on the other hand, remains a fascinating figure in Oscar history. She carries a unique distinction that she herself never confirmed in life: that she is the only Indian actress ever nominated for an Oscar. While inclusion remains a massive issue for the film and TV industries, it's growing increasingly hopeful that she'll be joined in the record books by another Indian actress (Quantico's Priyanka Chopra, perhaps?) very soon.\n\nSunday night in London, Patel became the first actor of Indian descent to win a BAFTA \u2014 the British equivalent of an Oscar \u2014 for his work in Lion. Decades after Oberon's career peak, actors of Indian descent like Patel, Chopra and more are cracking through the very barriers that kept Oberon's identity concealed. It's a slow process, but a historic one."}]}
