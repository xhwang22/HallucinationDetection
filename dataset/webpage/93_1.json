He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "http://chinaknowledge.de/History/Division/beiqi-rulers.html", "page_content": "Sep 7, 2011 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nThe Northern Qi dynasty Beiqi \u5317\u9f4a (550-577) ruled over one of the successor states of the Northern Wei empire \u5317\u9b4f (386-534). It belongs to the so-called Northern Dynasties \u5317\u671d (386~581) and was founded by Gao Yang \u9ad8\u6d0b, son of the powerful general Gao Huan \u9ad8\u6b61, who dominated the court of the Eastern Wei dynasty \u6771\u9b4f (534-550). The Northern Qi empire covered the lower region of the Yellow River, modern Shanxi, the Shandong Peninsula, and the northern parts of modern Jiangsu and Anhui. The continuing military campaigns of Gao Yang expanded the territory of the Northern Qi empire towards the north and the south. The capital was Ye \u9134 (near modern Anyang \u5b89\u967d, Hebei). Compared with the Northern Zhou empire \u5317\u5468 (557-581) in the west and the Chen empire \u9673 (557-589) in the south, Gao Yang ruled over a relatively wealthy country, disposing of an impressive cultivated area, salt and iron industry and a ceramical industry.\n\nDuring the political disturbances of the 530es, general Gao Huan (posthumous title Emperor Shenwu \u5317\u9f4a\u795e\u6b66\u5e1d) controlled the political center of the Northern Wei dynasty. He installed Yuan Xiu \u5143\u4fee, and later Yuan Shanjian \u5143\u5584\u898b as the puppet emperors of the Eastern Wei empire. After his death in 547 his son Gao Yang (posthumous title Emperor Wenxuan \u5317\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d, r. 550-559) took over the regency for the puppet emperors and proclaimed himself emperor of Qi in 550. His dynasty is by historians called the \"Northern Qi\", in order to avoid confusion with the Soutern Qi \u5357\u9f4a (479-502) that had been founded by the house of Xiao \u856d.\n\nGao Yang continued the conquest politics of his father and was able to defeat northern nomad tribes of the Kumoxi \u5eab\u83ab\u595a, Khitan \u5951\u4e39, and Rouran \u67d4\u7136, and also conquered parts of the Huai River \u6dee\u6c34 region.\n\nGao Yang perpetuated the equal-field system (juntianfa \u5747\u7530\u6cd5) invented by the Northern Wei administrators. All land within 30 li (ca. 15 kms) around the capital was state-owned common field (gongtian \u516c\u7530) and was distributed among the state officials and officers of the palace guard (yulin huben \u7fbd\u6797\u864e\u8cc1, both from the various Ta\u0263ba\u010d tribes) that had been resettled from around the old capital Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan). All land closer to the capital than 100 li was allotted to Chinese officials and officers. While these fields were distributed according to the official ranks, the fields in the rest of the country were distributed equally among the population. Yet there were some differences in the concretisation of field allotment, at least nominally, because the term beitian \u500d\u7530 \"double field\" was not any more used, as it had been under the Northern Wei. Slaves (nubi \u5974\u5a62) were also included in the calculation of the amount of field given to one household. The taxes, delivered in cloth and grain, were assessed according to \"one bed\" (i.e. one couple). Unmarried women only had to deliver half of the amount of cloth, so that a lot of persons declared themselves as not yet married.\n\nAfter the death of Gao Yang, his son Gao Yin \u9ad8\u6bb7 (known as the Deposed Emperor \u5317\u9f4a\u5ee2\u5e1d, r. 559-560) and Yang's brothers Gao Yan \u9ad8\u6f14 (Emperor Xiaozhao \u5317\u9f4a\u5b5d\u662d\u5e1d, r. 560) and Gao Zhan \u9ad8\u6e5b (Emperor Wucheng \u5317\u9f4a\u6b66\u6210\u5e1d, r. 561-564), as well as the latter's son Gao Wei \u9ad8\u7def (known as the Last Ruler \u5317\u9f4a\u5f8c\u4e3b, r. 564-576) neglected the business of active politics. Historiographers describe them as decadent and corrupt, as subject to pleasures that required a higher and higher tax income to be posed on the shoulders of the peasant population. High posts in the central government were only given to favourites, and local offices were only even sold to those offering sufficient money.

Emperor Wenxuan had a Han Chinese father Gao Yang, and a Xianbei mother, Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun. As eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan was succeeded by his sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang, who took the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei in 550 and established Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan.\n\nAlthough Northern Qi was plagued by violence and/or incompetent emperors (Emperor Wenxuan, Emperor Wucheng, and Gao Wei), corrupt officials, and deteriorating armies for most of its existence, it was the strongest state of the three main Chinese states (along with northern zhou dynasty state and chen dynasty) when it was established.\n\nLike most imperial dynasties, it gradually declined and was destroyed by northern zhou dynasty in 577. Emperor Wenxuan's son Gao Shaoyi, the Prince of Fanyang, under protection by Tujue, later declared himself the emperor of Northern Qi in exile, but was turned over by Tujue to northern zhou dynasty in 580 and exiled to modern Sichuan .

Due to his great efforts, Northern Qi became a strong power in a very short period of time.

He was generally considered a capable ruler, but ruled for less than two years before dying from injuries suffered from falling off a horse. northern qi would not have another capable ruler after his death.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yan was born in 535, as the third of six sons that Gao Huan, then the paramount general of eastern wei and the Prince of Bohai, had with his wife Princess Lou Zhaojun, after his older brothers Gao Cheng and Gao Yang, and Gao Huan's sixth son overall. He was said to be intelligent in his childhood, and was much favored by his mother Princess Lou. At age three, in 538, he was created the Duke of Changshan. He was said to be studious, particularly favoring the Book of Han in his studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring Emperor Wenxuan's reign In 550, Gao Yang, who had become regent of eastern wei following the deaths of Gao Huan in 547 and Gao Cheng in 549, had Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi as its Emperor Wenxuan. As the new emperor's brother, Gao Yan was created the Prince of Changshan. He received a number of official posts during Emperor Wenxuan's reign, and was said to have distinguished himself in his ability to govern despite his youth, and was known for his solemnity. However, he was also said to be so stern in his ways that if subordinates carried out incorrect actions, he would cane them severely. At times, he participated in military campaigns that Emperor Wenxuan personally commanded.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan ruled northern qi diligently early in his reign, but later in his reign, perhaps starting 554 or so, he began to act erratically and cruelly toward his officials and members of his own household. On one occasion, when invited to one of Emperor Wenxuan's feasts, his face showed sadness and anxiety, and Emperor Wenxuan deduced that he must have disapproved Emperor Wenxuan's preoccupation with drinking and women, and he declared that he would stop drinking\u2014although his abstension from alcohol only lasted for several days. Emperor Wenxuan also favored irreverent and sometimes immoral games within his palace, but when Gao Yan was present he would curb his behavior, and while Emperor Wenxuan was known for often visiting nobles' households and having sexual relations with their women, regardless of their relationships to him, he did not do so as to Gao Yan's household. During this period of Emperor Wenxuan's reign, then, Gao Yan became one of the only few individuals who would dare to try to get the emperor to change his behavior, although often only with temporary effect. On one occasion, Gao Yan offered a petition listing a number of behaviors that he believed Emperor Wenxuan should change\u2014and this caused Emperor Wenxuan to be exceedingly angry at him, threatening to kill him and sentencing Gao Yan's chief advisor, Wang Xi (\u738b\u550f), whom Emperor Wenxuan suspected to have contributed to the petition, to hard labor. In a later incident, Emperor Wenxuan, after having awarded Gao Yan a lady in waiting while drunk, forgot about the award after he became sober, and accused Gao Yan of stealing the lady in waiting, battering Gao Yan severely with a sword hilt. Gao Yan became angry and went on a hunger strike. Emperor Wenxuan, in order to placate Gao Yan, then agreed to release Wang Xi from hard labor and return him to Gao Yan's headquarters. Meanwhile, Emperor Wenxuan, who distrusted eastern wei's Yuan imperial household, of whom Gao Yan's wife Princess Yuan was a member, tried to get Gao Yan to divorce Princess Yuan, but Gao Yan refused, and when Emperor Wenxuan carried out a massacre of the Yuans in 559, it was at Gao Yan's earnest intercession that Emperor Wenxuan spared Princess Yuan's father Yuan Man (\u5143\u883b) and his family.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan's crown prince was his son Gao Yin, who was known for his studiousness, but Emperor Wenxuan, who, despite his Han ethnicity, favored Xianbei warrior ways, felt that Gao Yin was too Han in his thinking and repeatedly considered deposing him. Particularly when he was drunk, Emperor Wenxuan often stated that he would pass the throne to Gao Yan, and he stopped doing so only after being warned by his prime minister Yang Yin that his statements was potentially causing instability.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to his wife Empress Li Zu'e, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei.\n\n\n\nDuring Emperor Fei's reign Pursuant to Emperor Wenxuan's will, the government was in the hands of several of his trusted officials -- Yang Yin, Gao Guiyan (\u9ad8\u6b78\u5f65) the Prince of Pingqin, Yan Zixian (\u71d5\u5b50\u737b), and Zheng Yi (\u912d\u9824). Gao Yan, while respected by the people, was not given great power, and while Grand Empress Dowager Lou had some desire to have Gao Yan made emperor instead, there was insufficient support at the time, and Yang, in fear that Gao Yan and another brother of Emperor Wenxuan, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, would try to take power, took steps to curb their authorities. Meanwhile, Gao Yan's own supporters, citing the example of the Duke of Zhou, were suggesting to him that he should take power as the young emperor's uncle, and while Gao Yan initially rejected such overtures, he was watching the political scene carefully.\n\nAs Emperor Fei took the throne while he was attending to his father's deathbed at the secondary capital Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), when he proceeded to the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ) in spring 560, it was initially believed that Gao Yan or Gao Dan would be put in charge of Jinyang\u2014then perhaps the most militarily secure city in the empire; instead, by the arrangements of Yang and his associates, the two princes were ordered to accompany the young emperor to Yecheng.\n\nOnce the imperial train arrived at Yecheng, the situation became even more tense, as an associate of Yang's, Kezhuhun Tianhe (\u53ef\u6731\u6e3e\u5929\u548c), was convinced that Emperor Fei would not be safe in his reign unless his two uncles were killed, and alternatively, Yan Zixian considered putting Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who still wielded much power as the clan matriarch, under house arrest, and forcing her to turn her authorities to Empress Dowager Li. Meanwhile, the ambitious Yang was carrying out a governmental reorganization scheme to trim unnecessary offices and titles and to remove incompetent officials. The officials who were hurt by Yang's actions became disaffected and largely hoped that Gao Yan and Gao Dan would take action and began to encourage them to do so. In spring 560, Yang considered sending Gao Yan and Gao Dan outside the capital to be provincial governors, but Emperor Fei initially disagreed. Yang wrote a submission to Empress Dowager Li to ask her to consider, and she consulted her lady in waiting Li Changyi (\u674e\u660c\u5100), who leaked the news to Grand Empress Dowager Lou. She informed the two princes, and they set up an ambush, with Gao Guiyan and the generals Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) and Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1), at a ceremony where Gao Yan was to be named to a ceremonial post. Yang, Kezhuhun, Yan, Zheng, and Song Qindao (\u5b8b\u6b3d\u9053) were all severely battered and captured. Gao Yan and Gao Dan then entered the palace and publicly accused Yang and his associates of crimes; Yang and his associates were executed, and Gao Yan took control of the government. He soon went to take up post at Jinyang, controlling the government remotely.\n\nGao Yan's advisors, headed by Wang Xi and Zhao Yanshen (\u8d99\u5f65\u6df1), then suggested that he take the throne himself\u2014noting to him that his actions in killing Yang and his associates meant that when Emperor Fei was grown, he would never be able to have a cordial relationship with Emperor Fei. Gao Yan agreed, and although initially Grand Empress Dowager Lou found the action inadvisable, she finally agreed. In fall 560, she issued an edict deposing Emperor Fei and making Gao Yan emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhao); however, in the edict, she sternly warned Emperor Xiaozhao to make sure that nothing would happen to Emperor Fei, who was demoted to the rank of Prince of Ji'nan. Grand Empress Dowager Lou became again known as Empress Dowager Lou, while Empress Dowager Li was given the title of Empress Wenxuan.\n\n\n\nReign Emperor Xiaozhao was said to be diligent in his actions, and after he became emperor, he spent all day looking at laws and regulations of Emperor Wenxuan, seeking to revise the laws that were inappropriate or too harsh. He was praised for his diligence, but also criticized for being overly obsessed with details. He was also said to be filial pious toward Empress Dowager Lou and loving to his brothers. One brother who was dissatisfied with him, however, was Gao Dan, whom Emperor Xiaozhao had previously agreed to make crown prince\u2014but who was passed over in favor of Emperor Xiaozhao's own son Gao Bainian, whom Emperor Xiaozhao created crown prince in winter 560, when he also created Princess Yuan empress. He also started long-term strategic planning against rival northern zhou, planning to gradually seize northern zhou territory east of the Yellow River bit by bit. He entrusted much of his decision-making to Wang Xi, Yang Xiuzhi (\u967d\u4f11\u4e4b), and Cui Jie (\u5d14\u52bc), often having them stay in the palace all day to examine the laws and regulations.\n\nIn spring 561, Emperor Xiaozhao had the former liang dynasty general Wang Lin, who had fled to northern qi in 560 after his failed attempt, supported by northern qi, to let Xiao Zhuang rule as Liang's emperor, against chen dynasty and the northern zhou-supported Emperor Xuan of Western Liang, take up position at Hefei (\u5408\u80a5, in modern Hefei , Anhui ), to plan a campaign against Chen. Later, he made Wang the governor of Yang Province (\u63da\u5dde, modern central Anhui ).\n\nEmperor Xiaozhao, throughout his reign, stayed at the secondary capital Jinyang and did not stay at Yecheng, leaving Yecheng in Gao Dan's control. In fall 561, Emperor Xiaozhao, concerned that Gao Dan was becoming too powerful, tried to transfer some of Gao Dan's authority to the general Hul\u00fc Xian (\u659b\u5f8b\u7fa8, Hul\u00fc Jin's son), but Gao Dan refused to transfer any of his authority. Meanwhile, sorcerers informed Emperor Xiaozhao that the imperial aura was still at Yecheng, making Emperor Xiaozhao concerned. Gao Guiyan, who was concerned that Gao Yin would one day take the throne again and retaliate against him, persuaded Emperor Xiaozhao that his nephew had to be removed, and so Emperor Xiaozhao issued an edict to summon the Prince of Ji'nan to Jinyang. Gao Dan, was disappointed at Emperor Xiaozhao not created him crown prince, briefly considered redeclaring Gao Yin emperor and starting a rebellion against Emperor Xiaozhao, but ultimately chose not to do it, as his own sorcerers informed him that they believed that he would become emperor one day anyway. He therefore sent Gao Yin to Jinyang. Soon, Emperor Xiaozhao sent assassins to deliver poisoned wine to Gao Yin. Gao Yin refused to drink it, and the assassins strangled him. Emperor Xiaozhao soon regretted killing his nephew.\n\nIn winter 561, while hunting, Emperor Xiaozhao's horse was spooked by a rabbit, and he fell off the horse and suffered broken ribs. When Empress Dowager Lou came to see him, she asked him where Gao Yin was, and he could not answer. Empress Dowager Lou angrily stated, \"Did you not kill him? Because you did not listen to me, you should die!\" and left without seeing him again. Soon, believing himself to be near death, he issued an edict stating that Gao Bainian was too young to take the throne, and that the throne was instead to be passed to Gao Dan. He also wrote a letter to Gao Dan, stating, \"Bainian is innocent. You can do anything with him, but please do not kill him!\" He died later that day, while lamenting that he was unable to serve his mother for the rest of her life. Gao Dan soon arrived at Jinyang and took the throne (as Emperor Wucheng).\n\n\n\nEra name Huangjian (\u7687\u5efa hu\u00e1ng ji\u00e0n) 560-561\n\n"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/chen.yueyi/2503023", "page_content": "Chen Yueyi\n\nGeneral emperor\n\n565 (age 85)\n\nChen Shanti was initially a servant of the Northern Wei general Erzhu Zhao, and after Erzhu\"s defeat by Gao Huan became a servant to Gao.

After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n:... Wenxuan drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e

Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/3747792", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529-559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty Northern Qi . He was the second son of Eastern Wei 's paramount general Gao Huan , and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at his prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin , and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei 's paramount general Erzhu Rong . His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng . After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well-regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent . He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan , Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin , to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan , Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong , Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi , with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager .\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress . Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince .\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai , the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian , whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou , Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu , Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang , Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou , Shanxi ), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue .\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan -- and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran , which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou , Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the \" History of Northern Dynasties \", and Sima Guang , the author of the \" Zizhi Tongjian \", saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule -- that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality -- and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later -- and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (\" Book of Wei \") was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as \"Huishu\" (\u7a62\u66f8 -- the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou , Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan , Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang , declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang , Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emepror Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his \"Zizhi Tongjian\":\n\n:\"... [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Soemtimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. he often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\"\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards -- if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty , and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin , then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan , Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unahppy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\nEra name\n\n* \"Tianbao\" (\u5929\u4fdd ti\u0101n b\u01ceo) 550-559\n\nPersonal

(545\u2013561), personal name(\u9ad8\u6bb7), courtesy name(\u6b63\u9053), posthumously(\u6d4e\u5357\u95f5\u60bc\u738b), was briefly an emperor of the Northern Qi . He was the oldest son of the first emperor, Emperor Wenxuan (Gao Yang), and he became emperor after Emperor Wenxuan's death in 559. However, in his young age, the officials fought over power, and in 560, Emperor Fei's uncle Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan killed the prime minister Yang Yin and took over power, soon deposing Emperor Fei and taking the throne himself as Emperor Xiaozhao. In 561, fearful of prophecies that Emperor Fei would return to the throne, Emperor Xiaozhao had him put to death.\n\nRead more...: Background Reign Removal and death Family Ancestry\n\nBackground\n\nGao Yin was born in 545, when his father Gao Yang, then the Duke of Taiyuan, was not viewed as an important figure in Eastern Wei's governmental structure, as while Gao Yang's father Gao Huan was the paramount general of the state, Gao Huan's heir apparent was not Gao Yang but Gao Yang's older brother Gao Cheng. Gao Yin's mother was Gao Yang's wife, the ethnically Han Li Zu'e, who carried the title the Duchess of Taiyuan, who subsequently gave birth to another son, Gao Shaode (\u9ad8\u7ecd\u5fb7).\n\nIn 547, Gao Huan died, and Gao Cheng became effective regent of Eastern Wei, dominating the political scene, and he soon considered taking the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei. However, while preparing, he was assassinated by his slave Lan Jing (\u5170\u4eac) in 549. In the aftermaths of Gao Cheng's death, Gao Yang, as the next oldest son of Gao Huan, took control of the Eastern Wei government. In 550, then bearing the title of Prince of Qi, had Emperor Xiaojing yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan. Despite the opposition of some officials (based on her Han ethnicity), Emperor Wenxuan created his wife Princess Li empress and created Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nGao Yin was considered intelligent and considerate as a child. For example, when he held feasts at the North Palace, he would invite his cousins, but he would not invite Gao Cheng's son Gao Xiaowan (\u9ad8\u5b5d\u742c), because Gao Cheng died in the North Palace, and so he did not want Gao Xiaowan to feast at his father's death place. Another episode mentioned by the Book of Northern Qi involved Gao Yin's being greatly impressed by the sexually moral official Xu Sanchou (\u8bb8\u6563\u6101) that he awarded Xu a great amount of silk. (It may very well be that the story was recorded as a veiled praise for Gao Yin's being himself sexually moral, as compared to his sexually promiscuous father and uncles.)\n\nHowever, Emperor Wenxuan, who was violent and military-minded and who disfavored Han ways, felt that Gao Yin was too meek and considered deposing him. On one occasion, Emperor Wenxuan, who was accustomed to personally executing condemned prisoners inside the palace, ordered Gao Yin to carry out the execution. Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and, in anger, Emperor Wenxuan battered him with the handle of a whip. Since that incident, Gao Yin was recorded as suffering from a panic disorder, at times unable to speak and at times behaving erratically. At times, when the alcoholic Emperor Wenxuan was drunk, he would declare that he might eventually give the throne instead to Gao Yin's uncle Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, further leading to questions of succession.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei.\n\nReign\n\nPursuant to Emperor Wenxuan's will, the government was in the hands of several of his trusted officials -- Yang Yin the Prince of Kaifeng, Gao Guiyan (\u9ad8\u5f52\u5f66) the Prince of Pingqin, Yan Zixian (\u71d5\u5b50\u732e), and Zheng Yi (\u90d1\u9890). Gao Yan, while respected by the people, was not given great power, and while his (and Emperor Wenxuan's) mother Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun had some desire to have Gao Yan made emperor instead, there was insufficient support at the time, and Yang, in fear that Gao Yan and another brother of Emperor Wenxuan, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, would try to take power, took steps to curb their authorities. Emperor Fei honored his grandmother Empress Dowager Lou as grand empress dowager and mother Empress Li as empress dowager. Pursuant to his edicts, the palace construction projects that Emperor Wenxuan started, which caused much misery for his people in the latter years of his reign, were halted.\n\nAs Emperor Fei took the throne while he was attending to his father's deathbed at the secondary capital Jinyang (\u664b\u9633, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), when he proceeded to the capital Yecheng in spring 560, it was initially believed that Gao Yan or Gao Zhan would be put in charge of Jinyang\u2014then perhaps the most militarily secure city in the empire; instead, by the arrangements of Yang and his associates, the two princes were ordered to accompany the young emperor to Yecheng.\n\nOnce the imperial train arrived at Yecheng, the situation became even more tense, as an associate of Yang's, Kezhuhun Tianhe (\u53ef\u6731\u6d51\u5929\u548c), was convinced that Emperor Fei would not be safe in his reign unless his two uncles were killed, and alternatively, Yan Zixian considered putting Grand Empress Dowager Lou, who still wielded much power as the clan matriarch, under house arrest, and forcing her to turn her authorities to Empress Dowager Li. Meanwhile, the ambitious Yang was carrying out a governmental reorganization scheme to trim unnecessary offices and titles and to remove incompetent officials. The officials who were hurt by Yang's actions became disaffected and largely hoped that Gao Yan and Gao Zhan would take action and began to encourage them to do so. Yang considered sending Gao Yan and Gao Zhan outside the capital to be provincial governors, but Emperor Fei initially disagreed. Yang wrote a submission to Empress Dowager Li to ask her to consider, and she consulted her lady in waiting Li Changyi (\u674e\u660c\u4eea), who leaked the news to Grand Empress Dowager Lou. She informed the two princes, and they set up an ambush, with Gao Guiyan and the generals Heba Ren (\u8d3a\u62d4\u4ec1) and Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1), at a ceremony where Gao Yan was to be named to a ceremonial post. Yang, Kezhuhun, Yan, Zheng, and Song Qindao (\u5b8b\u94a6\u9053) were all captured and severely battered. Gao Yan and Gao Zhan then entered the palace and publicly accused Yang and his associates of crimes; Yang and his associates were executed, and Gao Yan took control of the government. He soon went to take up post at Jinyang, controlling the government remotely.\n\nRemoval and death\n\nIn fall 560, after Gao Yan convinced Grand Empress Dowager Lou the action is necessary, Grand Empress Dowager Lou issued an edict deposing Emperor Fei and making Gao Yan emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhao). The former emperor was created the Prince of Ji'nan. He was moved out of the main palace but was given a subsidiary palace at Yecheng. With Emperor Xiaozhao largely spending his time at Jinyang, Gao Zhan was in charge of Yecheng, and the prince was under his guard.\n\nIn fall 561, sorcerers informed Emperor Xiaozhao that the imperial aura was still at Yecheng, making Emperor Xiaozhao concerned. Meanwhile, Gao Guiyan, who was concerned that Gao Yin would one day take the throne again and retaliate against him, persuaded Emperor Xiaozhao that his nephew had to be removed, and so Emperor Xiaozhao issued an edict to summon Gao Yin to Jinyang. Gao Zhan, who at this time was disappointed at Emperor Xiaozhao not created him crown prince (instead creating his own son Gao Bainian crown prince), briefly considered redeclaring Gao Yin emperor and starting a rebellion against Emperor Xiaozhao, but ultimately chose not to do it, as his own sorcerers informed him that they believed that he would become emperor one day anyway. He therefore sent Gao Yin to Jinyang. Soon, Emperor Xiaozhao sent assassins to deliver poisoned wine to Gao Yin. Gao Yin refused to drink it, and the assassins strangled him. He was buried with honors due a prince, not an emperor.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts:\n\n\u2022 Princess consort, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u738b\u5983 \u8d75\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f; 549\u2013570), first cousin, personal name Nansheng (\u96be\u80dc)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/dynasty/northern_qi.php", "page_content": "The Northern Qi Dynasty (simplified Chinese: \u5317\u9f50\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u5317\u9f4a\u671d; pinyin: B\u011bi Q\u00ed Ch\u00e1o) was one of the Northern dynasties of Chinese history and ruled northern China from 550 to 577.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Chinese state of Northern Qi was the successor state of the Chinese/Xianbei state of eastern wei and was founded by Emperor Wenxuan. Emperor Wenxuan had a Han Chinese father Gao Yang, and a Xianbei mother, Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun. As eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan was succeeded by his sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang, who took the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei in 550 and established Northern Qi as its Emperor Wenxuan.\n\nAlthough Northern Qi was plagued by violence and/or incompetent emperors (Emperor Wenxuan, Emperor Wucheng, and Gao Wei), corrupt officials, and deteriorating armies for most of its existence, it was the strongest state of the three main Chinese states (along with northern zhou dynasty state and chen dynasty) when it was established.\n\nLike most imperial dynasties, it gradually declined and was destroyed by northern zhou dynasty in 577. Emperor Wenxuan's son Gao Shaoyi, the Prince of Fanyang, under protection by Tujue, later declared himself the emperor of Northern Qi in exile, but was turned over by Tujue to northern zhou dynasty in 580 and exiled to modern Sichuan . It is a matter of controversy whether Gao Shaoyi should properly be considered a Northern Qi emperor, but in any case the year 577 is generally considered by historians as the ending date for Northern Qi."}]}
