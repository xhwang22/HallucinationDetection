A prolific writer, Arniches collaborated in the creation of nearly two hundred sainettes (one-act plays), zarzuelas (musical comedies), and grotesque tragedies (full-length dramas). Early in his career, Arniches established himself as a master of the Spanish theatrical form gen\u00e9ro chico (brief theatrical works), which includes the forms of the sainete and zarzuela. Arniches's brief theatrical pieces provided the residents of Madrid with a unique reflection of their own customs and conventions, popularly called costumbrismo. Arniches brings the vibrant colors, sounds, and pageantry of Spanish\u2014and particularly, Madrilenian\u2014folk tradition onto the stage. In his biography Carlos Arniches, Douglas R. McKay commented that in Arniches's early writing: \"He perfected the classical Spanish sainete and became its most distinguished architect; late in life he added a new and exciting genre to the tradition of full-length drama: the grotesque tragedy.\"\n\nArniches, the fifth child and only son in a family of seven, was born in the Mediterranean coastal town of Alicante in 1866. During his secondary school years, Arniches showed evidence of his later talent by producing short plays with the help of his fellow students. Arniches's father lost his job at a tobacco factory through political manipulation. Because a yellow fever epidemic and several political insurrections occurred around the same time, Arniches's parents moved their family to Barcelona in 1880. Carlos Arniches was deeply affected by his father's dismissal and the subsequent poverty that the family experienced. Later in life, he incorporated his bitter feelings about political injustice and corruption into the play Los caciques, which forcefully attacks the system of political \"bosses.\"\n\nArniches lived in Barcelona for five years, working as a dry goods clerk, a job that earned him a reasonable salary and helped to support his family. He preferred, however, to write articles for La Vanguardia, a leading newspaper in Barcelona, because it connected him with the literary world of the day. In 1885 Arniches moved to Madrid in the company of a maiden aunt. She supported his financial needs for two years, until she realized that she could not impose her will upon her nephew and convince him to become a lawyer. Arniches's insistence upon a literary career resulted in a rift between them, and he found himself penniless at the age of twenty.\n\nThe following two years were financially bleak, but Arniches later credited this time as a character-building period of his life. He worked on the editorial staffs of three small newspapers and, according to McKay, came to value and believe \"in the fortifying virtue of work.\" When it seemed that he had reached his lowest and most desperate point, Arniches published his first book, a reading primer titled Cartilla y cuaderno de lectura. This rhyming alphabet book describes the life of the monarch, Alfonso XII, and was dedicated to the king's son, Alfonso XIII. The ninety-six-page work was almost immediately utilized as a primer throughout the Spanish public school system.\n\nIn 1888, scarcely a year after the reading primer appeared, Arniches introduced his first play, Casa editorial, a musical revue written with an older author from Alicante, Gonzalo Cant\u00f3. The production continued for 150 performances; when it completed its run, Arniches's days of poverty were ended. After that point, his life became \"a document of ascendant success, comfort and prosperity,\" according to McKay. Casa editorial received so much praise from both critics and the public that Arniches decided to continue his career in the theatrical world. He followed this success with two more musical revues, which were even more popular than the first. The fourth play, Las manias, was similar in style to the preceding three works, but it was poorly received and proved to be a terrible failure. Arniches, however, did not allow that to deter his career. Instead, he directed his energies into writing sainetes, one-act plays that depict, in McKay's words, \"the popular customs of the common people.\"\n\nArniches's early works were typical of the Spanish sainete form, and he brought no new impulses to the genre. McKay commented that the early characters were usually \"involved in single, uncomplicated love conflicts\" that tended to be resolved by a happy ending. He also remarked that \"the plot line in most of these works is based upon mistaken identities and hilarious misunderstandings.\" Through his collaborative work with Gonzalo Cant\u00f3 and Celso Lucio, however, Arniches began to introduce novel elements into the sainete. The first difference was that Arniches's later plays were occasionally marked by \"spontaneous, sparkling dialogue\" that emerges during the action. The second new element, according to McKay, was \"the emphasis on problems of real people \u2026 peddlers, washerwomen, barbers, dressmakers, maids\u2014in short, the poor and simple citizens of the city.\" Arniches sought to embody and preserve the unique qualities of the Spanish folk spirit\u2014particularly with regard to the Madrilenian citizenry\u2014in his later sainetes.\n\nAlthough Arniches wrote many of his stage plays in collaboration with other writers, there are a few pieces that serve as strong examples of his individual style. One of these is the sainete El santo de la Isidra. The play's action occurs during the annual Festival of San Isidro, a feast honoring Isidore, the patron saint of Madrid. El santo de la Isidra concerns two young men who vie for the hand of a lovely young maiden, Isidra. Her former suitor, a bully and a coward, is challenged and defeated by a shy young man named Venancio. As McKay noted, the plot is not particularly original, but the play's \"major importance is found in the magnificent local color attending the fast pace of the action.\" For example, according to McKay, Amiches was able to \"convey a sense of the unrehearsed spirit of living\" in the opening scene of the play, wherein flower vendors shout the praises of their wares, young people argue with one another, and a shoemaker hammers on the sole of a shoe.\n\nSix years later, in 1904, Amiches introduced the play Las estrellas, which deals with the themes of illusion and reality. A barber, Prudencio, falsely believes that his teen-aged daughter and son have talents for acting and bullfighting, respectively. He has heard that his friend's wife and daughter are earning their fortunes as members of a well-respected dance company in Paris, and he wishes to secure an equally bright future for his own family. In order to pursue his dreams of fame and fortune for his children, Prudencio sells the barbershop lease for a mere 700 pesetas. His strong-willed wife, Feliciana, realizes that, as much as she loves her children, they have no such talent as her husband imagines, and she tries to show him the truth. However, he will not listen to his wife, and encourages his daughter to make her stage debut, and his son to enter the bullfighting ring. The three leave Feliciana behind and go off to seek their fortunes. After their departure Feliciana manages to recover the barbershop lease with the help of her brother, who is a lawyer. As might be expected, both children are shamed and humiliated by their endeavors, and they return home with their father. At first Feliciana is furious with them for their foolishness, but then she welcomes them tenderly back into their home. It seems as if this will be one of Amiches's typically happy endings, but then Prudencio's friend returns from Paris, having discovered that his wife and daughter have actually been earning their money through prostitution rather than dancing.\n\nMcKay suggested that this play begins a \"gradual transformation from the genial vignettes of Madrid folk life to plays of an expanded intrigue.\" He felt that in Las estrellas, Amiches moves into a new realm, one in which \"social and moral concerns take precedence over mere 'costumbrismo'\". The playwright himself considered Las estrellas to be the sainete that is most representative of his theatrical work.\n\nIn 1918 Amiches began to write in the genre that became known as grotesque tragedies. These plays mingle humor and pathos in a way that critic Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala, as quoted by McKay, called \"an exaggeration of comedy.\" The first in the series of grotesque tragedies is Que viene mi marido! This play combines humor and slapstick with a plot that revolves around a young woman who can only inherit a great fortune if she is a widow. This play exemplifies a pivotal moment in Amiches's relation to the critics of his time. Until then, Amiches had generally received favorable reviews from the literary critics. There were a few detractors, such as Jos\u00e9 Vega and Nicol\u00e1s Gonz\u00e1lez Ruiz, who, as McKay noted, charged that \"Amiches is a typical case of theatrical inertia, cleverly expanding the simple sainete to accommodate the playgoers of a new era.\" Another critic, Jos\u00e9 Benjamin, also quoted by McKay, disagreed and stated: \"Amiches never designed his plays after prescribed formulas.\"\n\nAfter viewing Que viene mi marido!, author and literary critic Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala published a series of influential articles about Amiches. McKay noted that he praised the play \"with unreserved gusto, enjoining the world of higher criticism to give heed to the artistic virtues of one of Spain's most remarkable playwrights.\" When these reviews appeared, the literary world seemed to consider Amiches more seriously than it had, and as McKay further mentioned, \"few disparaging remarks were written about Amiches' theater after 1920.\"\n\nIn 1921, Amiches achieved more honor in the form of an award from his hometown, Alicante. This city bestowed Arniches with the title of \"Alicante's Favorite Son.\" Not to be outdone, the citizens and government of Madrid not only named him \"Madrid's Favorite Adopted Son\" in 1931, but they also changed the name of a street, Calle Pe\u00f1on, to Calle Carlos Arniches.\n\nAt the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Amiches and his wife went into a self-imposed exile, traveling to Buenos Aires, Argentina. The separation from family and friends, although voluntary, was extremely painful for Arniches. In order to forget his sorrow, Arniches devoted himself to writing more plays. The public of Buenos Aires received his work with overwhelming enthusiasm and granted him the highest honorary tribute that a living artist could receive\u2014induction into the Ateneo Iberoamericano. Despite the theatrical successes in Argentina, Arniches and his wife gratefully returned to their homeland in 1940.\n\nUpon his return, Arniches continued to write throughout the remaining three years of his life. He was productive up until the last hours of his life, completing his final play, Don Verdades, late in the afternoon of April 15, 1943. On the following day, Arniches died of a heart attack, which many surmise was brought on by the writer's weakened condition following news of his daughter's premature death only a few months before.\n\nArniches's funeral was a spectacle of public mourning, only rarely seen in the history of Spain. McKay described the procession, which embodied the \"entire city's devotion to the memory of a beloved artist.\" Alfredo Marquerie, as quoted by McKay, related an often-repeated anecdote about the day. A city policeman noticed the enormous funeral procession crossing the streets of Madrid and asked a member of the procession for the name of the deceased. When the policeman heard that it was Arniches, \"he removed his helmet, abandoned his post, and joined the procession with tears in his eyes.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nEncyclopedia of World Literature in the Twentieth Century, 3rd edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1999.\n\nEveryman's Dictionary of European Writers, E.P.

Although he was undisputed successor to the great saineteros such as Ramon de la Cruz and Ricardo de la Vega, his background was far removed from the Madrid literary coffee houses and tertulias that bred so many of the capital's celebrated stage writers. He left home aged 14 for a post in a Barcelona bank, later working in a sewing machine factory. A benevolent maiden aunt covered the costs of a mutual move to Madrid in 1885, though she soon retired to Valencia and left him to his own financial devices. Penury forced him to move back to Barcelona, but one clever idea - a Rhyming Alphabet based on incidents from the life of Alfonso XII, dedicated to his young son and heir Alfonso XIII - won the heart of the Queen, who ordered its use in all Spanish schools. Arniches returned to Madrid, this time for good. His first short play Casa editorial was written with Gonzalo Cant\u00f3, and performed at the Teatro Eslava in 1888. Altogether he wrote over 200 stage pieces, many with other writers. Many of these earlier works are sainetes in one or two acts, with or without music, full of costumbrismo (popular life and customs) and written in the fresh, colourful and buoyant style which was his trademark. Later on he developed a new dramatic form, the tragi-comic tragedia grotesca, often farcical in action but trenchant in social commentary: the full-length plays La se\u00f1orita de Trev\u00e9lez (1916) and Es mi hombre (1921) are amongst the most potent of these. His spoken dialogue (other writers often wrote the sung lyrics) is fluent but far from vapid, sparkling with keen wit. His texts have a moral framework which allays any suspicion of frivolity. Arniches' scripts were in great demand with virtually all the leading composers and writers of the day. A mere handful may be singled out, though many more will be found in the Zarzuela Index. For Chap\u00ed he penned three notable works with Cant\u00f3 which cemented his reputation - Ortograf\u00eda (1888); La leyenda del monje (1890); and Las campanadas (1892) - two with Celso Lucio, El reclamo (1893) and V\u00eda libre (1893) - one with Asensio Mas, El pu\u00f1ao de rosas (1902) - and unaided La cara de Dios (1899) and El maldito dinero (1906). For Caballero he wrote Los aparecidos (1892), and the evergreen El cabo primero (1895, with Lucio); for Chueca, Los descamisados (1893) and El coche correo (1896), both with Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Silva. Of his many sainetes for Torregrosa El santo de La Isidra and La fiesta de San Ant\u00f3n (both 1898) retain their popularity; as does El pobre Valbuena (1904) with music by Torregrosa and Quinito Valverde, and lyrics by Enrique Garc\u00eda Alvarez. Arniches and Garc\u00eda Alvarez also enjoyed great success writing sainetes for the young Serrano such as El pollo Tejada (1906); the brilliant Alma de Dios (1907); and El trust de los tenorios (1910). La alegr\u00eda del batall\u00f3n (1909) was written for the same composer with F\u00e9lix Quintana. Alone, he wrote El amigo Melquiades (1914, music by Serrano and Quinito Valverde). A collaboration with Antonio Estremera, Don Quint\u00edn el amargao (1924), a sainete in two acts with a substantial music score by Jacinto Guerrero, proved one of his biggest music theatre successes. No less than three films were made of the play, two of them directed by no less than Luis Bu\u00f1uel (1935 and 1951), who amplified Arniches hints of surrealism in his treatment of the \"embittered\" anti-hero and his gangster sidekicks. Perhaps his heyday was the brilliant period between 1916 and 1926, when he was a nationally known and loved figure. His work rate later declined considerably - until the onset of the Civil War, when he moved to Argentina and resuscitated his career in theatre, radio and cinema. Unhappy away from his beloved Madrid, he and his wife returned home in the early 1940's, only to find the capital changed beyond recognition. Loved and respected for his personal virtues as well as his sainetes, Arniches died in Madrid on 16th April 1943, from heart failure brought on by news of the sudden death of his daughter Rosario. **See also El pud\u00edn negro de Stornoway (December 28th 1904), \"by Torregrosa and Quinito Valverde, to a libretto by Carlos Arniches\"**\n\n\n\n[Back to top of page]"}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/Seraf%C3%ADn_el_pinturero_o_Contra_el_querer.html?id=E2c8vgAACAAJ", "page_content": "This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.
