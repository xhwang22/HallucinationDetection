The Australian actor took on the role of the heroic WSB agent on December 2, 1980, and says that even he can't believe that four decades have passed since his first day in Port Charles.\n\n\"To look back and think I've been associated with this show for 40 years is pretty incredible, but to try to put that into words is difficult,\" he shares with Soap Opera Digest. \"As someone once said, you can't dwell on the past; you're as good as your next show. As long as I can entertain people, I'm doing the right thing.\"\n\nRogers surmises that one of the reasons that Robert has stuck around for so long (minus sporadic breaks from the soap, which we break down below) is because the character has somehow managed to resonate with a wide spectrum of viewers of all ages.\n\n\"As the years have gone by, I've managed to attract an across-the-board demographic across the audience, which is great,\" he says. \"To think that from the '80s to now, 40 years down the line, people still like what I'm doing, that's really gratifying. You think to yourself, 'Yeah, I did the right thing. I'm not sure what I did, but I did the right thing!' I look back on it with a degree of pride.\"\n\nRogers' 40-year history with GH is one heck of a roller coaster. As longtime fans might recall, his Port Charles journey began with an action-packed 1981 storyline in which Robert was following Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary), who he thought knew the whereabouts of a rare and elusive diamond called the Ice Princess. Robert was posing as a playboy financier who wanted the diamond for financial reasons, and when the two men butted heads, Robert revealed to Luke and his fianc\u00e9e, Laura Webber (Genie Francis), that he was actually a WSB agent working undercover to find the Ice Princess and retrieve it before it got into the hands of the Cassadine family. Luke agreed to help him get it back and fight the Cassadines before they tried to take over the world, using this diamond to do it -- thus beginning a friendship between Robert and Luke, with Robert even standing up as Luke's best man at his wedding.\n\nCongratulations to the amazing @tristanrogers on an historic 40 years on @GeneralHospital! #GH wouldn't be the show it is today without this legend of daytime television. Happy Anniversary! https://t.co/w1n499sTFy \u2014 Frank Valentini (@valentinifrank) December 2, 2020\n\nSome of Robert's other storylines over the past four decades include a loving relationship with his daughter, Robin (Kimberly McCullough); an at-first rocky relationship with his brother, Mac (John York); a battle with a deadly virus that nearly killed everyone in Port Charles; delivering Lorenzo (Ted King) and Skye's (Robin Christopher) baby; catching Faison (Anders Hove) when he was pretending to be \"Duke\"; a couple of serious comas; being presumed dead in a boat explosion; and romances with scores of beautiful women like Jackie Templeton (Demi Moore), Holly Sutton (Emma Samms), Katherine Delafield (Edie Lehmann), and Anna Devane (Finola Hughes).\n\nAt this time, it's unclear if GH is planning a tribute to Rogers for his 40th anniversary or if any special material will air to mark the special occasion. Soap Central will keep you updated if further information becomes available.\n\nAfter joining GH in 1980, Rogers stayed with the ABC soap opera until 1992, when Robert was (wrongly) declared dead in a boat explosion. He returned to the series in 1995 in spirit form to comfort Robin, who had found out she was HIV-positive and was dealing with the death of her boyfriend, Stone (Michael Sutton), from AIDS-related illness. Rogers returned again for two short arcs in 2006, during which Robert was discovered to be very much alive.\n\nRogers once again stepped back into the role of Robert in 2008, for GH's primetime spin-off series General Hospital: Night Shift. He made it back to the original GH in 2012, when Robert believed Robin had died in a lab explosion, and again in 2013, when Robin was revealed to be alive. However, in November of 2013, it was announced that the actor would be departing the series to return to The Young and the Restless, where he'd played the role of Colin Atkinson from 2010 to 2011.\n\nRogers returned as GH's Robert in December of 2015, but he was also portraying Colin on Y&R at the same time, so his return was rather short; he only stayed until February of 2016 and made another brief return from August to September that same year. Rogers returned to GH in April of 2018 for a short story arc in which he aided Anna in trying to locate her long-lost son, Henrik Faison. He returned yet again from July to September that same year for another story arc in which Anna and Finn (Michael Easton) went missing. Fortunately, he reprised the role of GH's Robert once again in January of 2019 and has remained on the soap since on a recurring basis."}, {"url": "https://famousstardom.com/tristan-rogers", "page_content": "Tristan Rogers is an Australian-American actor, best-known for his role as Robert Scorpio on ABC soap opera General Hospital.

Playing Robert Scorpio, a sophisticated and savvy operative for the World Security Bureau, Rogers was teamed up with the most famous couple in the world at that time -\"GH\" lovers Luke and Laura - to help save the world from being frozen solid. He went on to become one of the soap world's most iconic actors, even long after he had left the show and moved on to other endeavors.\n\nBorn June 3, 1946 in Melbourne, Australia, the young Rogers never seriously considered acting as a career. After starting a rock group with some friends in 1964, he learned to love the good life so much that a regular desk job was not for him. His music career evolved into acting, more out of laziness than ambition. After landing acting gigs on Australian television series such as \"Bellbird\" (1967-1977) and \"The Link Men\" (1970), Rogers made the big leap across the pond to Hollywood. Back in the pre-Aussie invasion days, actors from down under were told to lose their accent or never work. Rogers promptly worked on losing the accent. When he booked \"GH,\" however, he was told to keep it, making him the first foreigner to hit it big on a U.S. soap using his native accent.\n\nFew actors met with immediate success the way Rogers did when he joined \"GH\" as agent Robert Scorpio. His participation, along with Luke (Anthony Geary) and Laura (Genie Francis), in possibly the show's most famous storyline - the Ice Princess caper - sealed the deal with fans who were not used to such a unique accent nor such take-charge masculinity in their soap idols. Rogers became so popular, that when couple du jour Geary and Francis left the show in 1983, the Aussie assumed the full mantel of the show's premiere leading man. First, he romanced Luke's left-behind love, Holly Sutton (Emma Samms) to the delight of fans. Even more popular was his teaming with ex-wife Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). The two actors remained in the forefront of the show's storytelling canvas until 1992 when Scorpio and Anna were presumed killed in a boat explosion. In 1995, Rogers briefly reprised Scorpio in a series of dream sequences experienced by the character's daughter Robin and his old pal Luke. But as far as Rogers was concerned, his days of Robert Scorpio were behind him forever.\n\nFree from the daily grind and stifling fame of \"GH,\" Rogers worked steadily in prime time television. He made appearances on the series \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" in 1993, \"Babylon 5\" in 1994 and \"V.I.P\" in 1999. Rogers lent his distinctive accent for the animated TV series \"The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest\" in 1996 and \"Batman Beyond\" in 2000. He had also performed voice over for the feature film, \"The Rescuers Down Under\" (1990).\n\nIn 1997, Rogers appeared in and produced the Showtime series \"Fast Track,\" which delved into the world of race car drivers. Rogers enjoyed producing, but continued to act, too, appearing on \"The Quality of Mercy,\" and \"Family Law.\" \"GH\" was not the star's only soap opera - he was cast as private eye Hunter Jones on \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" in 1997.\n\nIn January 2006, the star created headlines for the first time in years when ABC announced that he would be reprising his role as Scorpio for a six-week sweeps arc on \"General Hospital.\" Viewers learned that Scorpio indeed had survived the boat explosion and was recruited by former employer, the WSB, to become a hired assassin. Rogers was reunited with Geary and Samms during his brief return. It was so successful that ABC announced the Australian actor would return for more episodes in May, as would Hughes and Samms, so as to mix it up love-triangle style."}, {"url": "https://www.thelist.com/864456/general-hospital-relationship-timeline-anna-and-robert/", "page_content": "Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) and Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) were never a romantic pair for very long, but some \"General Hospital\" fans believe they were the great loves of one another's lives even if their favorite pastime now is sitting in Anna's living room seeing what they can stream on TV for the evening (via Soap Central).

Every time this super spy shows up on GH, he brings the action and the drama, and now it looks like he\u2019ll be around for a while!\n\nRobert first appeared in Port Charles tracking Luke Spencer and Alexandra Quartermaine in search of the Ice Princess, which was really a large uncut diamond containing the secret to carbonic snow. Although Luke and Robert initially thought they were enemies, when they realized they were on the same side, they teamed up to stop the Cassadines from freezing the world. Following the adventure, Robert resigned from the World Security Bureau because they disagreed about destroying the Ice Princess and its formula. He briefly dated Tiffany Hill, who he\u2019d met during the caper, but their romance fizzled.\n\nRobert, Laura, and Luke\u2019s trip to Cassadine Island was anything but a vacation!

Robert was already helping Luke track down his missing wife, and they discovered David Gray had arranged for Laura Spencer\u2019s disappearance. After Luke killed David in a sword fight, they were led to believe Laura had drowned at sea, and Robert consoled his grieving friend.\n\nAfter he and Luke were caught up in an oil scam orchestrated by Holly Sutton\u2019s family, Robert ended up marrying the Brit. See, she was pregnant with Luke\u2019s baby and since he was presumed dead at the time, Robert made her his wife so she wouldn\u2019t be deported. Sadly, she miscarried the child, but Holly and Robert eventually found love.\n\nJackie wasn\u2019t thrilled when Holly\u2019s eyes turned from Luke to Robert in the end. Erik Hein/ABC via Getty Images\n\nWhen Mac Scorpio first came to town, Robert had a rocky relationship with his brother because he blamed him for the death of their parents. Thankfully they were able to bury the hatchet before Robert and his wife, Anna Devane, were presumed dead in 1992, leaving their teenage daughter, Robin, to be raised by Mac.\n\nRobert resurfaced in 2006, five years after Anna, to reveal that he was forced to go into hiding by the WBS and couldn\u2019t tell anyone where he was. He was tracking down a lethal strain of encephalitis from the South Pacific which menaced Port Charles. Later, Robert was diagnosed with colon cancer, and after slipping into a coma, he recovered and went to Europe for further treatment.\n\nLuke talked his friend off the ledge\u2026 literally! Rick Rowell/ABC via Getty Images\n\nAfter Robin was presumed dead in an explosion, Robert returned to Port Charles in 2012 and even contemplated taking his own life out of grief over not being able to protect his daughter. Thankfully, Luke was able to talk his friend down. Later, Luke brought Robert back to town to investigate the return of Duke Lavery who they soon discovered to be Cesar Faison in disguise. After locating the real Duke, Robert saw Robin alive but was put into a coma by Dr. Liesl Obrecht to keep him quiet. When he finally awoke, Robert managed to convince Anna their daughter was alive and after an adventure that found them held prisoner temporarily by Jerry Jax, they were reunited with Robin.\n\nRobert helped keep Anna from taking revenge by killing Faison, and later also helped her deal with her rage towards Carlos after he\u2019d killed Duke. In the spring of 2018, the spy appeared in Switzerland to offer Anna help in tracking down her son, Henrik Faison.

He also enlisted Finn\u2019s help to find a missing Anna, and when it turned out she was just bait to abduct Finn, Robert had to help them both escape their kidnappers. He then helped Anna track down Alex so she could get to the bottom of the mysterious virus that temporarily took away her eyesight. Of course, the spy was also a thorn in Finn\u2019s side as he prepared to propose to Anna, but nobody\u2019s perfect! Robert also aided Sonny in his search for Dante, journeying with him to Turkey to bring the guy home. Unfortunately, Dante had to leave again to undergo treatment for his PTSD and Robert was forced into retirement by the WSB.\n\nAfter Margaux Dawson resigned, Robert was hired as Port Charles\u2019 newest district attorney, since he apparently attended law school before being recruited by the WSB. This put him at the forefront of keeping Port Charles crime-free, which is a lot of work!\n\nABC\n\nRobert was shaken to hear reports that Holly had died while on WSB business, but remained skeptical, refusing to believe that she was really gone. He brought Olivia Falconeri to the WSB facility in Switzerland to visit her son, Dante, but he refused to see her. Before returning to Port Charles, they attended Holly\u2019s memorial service in England, but Robert was stunned to get a phone call that sounded like Holly begging him to help her! Olivia tagged along as Robert flew to Monte Carlo to investigate and find out what was really going on, and they got some help from Ethan Lovett, who was also after his mom, but they ultimately returned to Port Charles unable to rescue Holly.\n\nAfter their trip, Robert remained friendly with Olivia but kept his distance as it had put a strain on her marriage to Ned. He continued to work to help bring Peter August to justice and was devastated when Anna reported news that their old friend, Sean Donely, had passed away.\n\nRobert teamed up with Anna again to help stop Peter and was stunned to learn that Victor Cassadine was not only alive, but allied with the villain! After returning from Greece, Robert was stunned when a drunk Olivia kissed him and a jealous Ned punched him, but he was able to clear the air and help Olivia repair her marriage. He then traveled with Anna to Cassadine Island where they took Peter into custody.\n\nStay tuned to see what happens next!\n\nLove GH?
