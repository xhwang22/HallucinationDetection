Dananjaya is the latest one in that list. Having not played a first class game, Dananjaya was picked for the 2012 T20 WC. Mahela Jayawardene was so impressed by the youngsters control of the googly, carrom ball, leg-break, doosra and off-spinner, that he convinced the selectors to fast track him to the national side. Dananjaya did not disappoint as he played 4 games and picked up 7 wickets at an average of 13 and an economy under 7.\n\n\n\nHowever, he only played one more game before being dropped. He was also overlooked for the 2014 T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. With the success in the T20 World Cup, Dananjaya was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings during the 2013 edition for $20,000.\n\n\n\nRevolving doors of Sri Lankan cricket meant that Dhananjaya could never settle himself in the national team. Having played a handful of T20Is, he found himself completely out of favour with the national selectors for four long years. He was eventually recalled to the national team during the home season of 2017 and promptly made an immediate impact, grabbing career-best figures of four for 47 against the visiting Zimbabweans. It wasn't an one-off achievement, two days after his marriage, he claimed six for 54 against India, thereby cementing his place for the immediate future."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/cricket/sri-lankan-spinner-akila-dananjaya-cleared-to-bowl-in-international-cricket", "page_content": "The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Friday informed that Sri Lanka spinner Akila Dananjaya can start bowling in international cricket again after remedial work on his bowling action and re-assessment of the same.\n\nAkila Dananjaya was banned from bowling for one year in September 2019 after he was reported during a Test match against New Zealand in Galle.

This is the second time Dananjaya has been banned from bowling by the ICC after being handed a suspension in December 2018. However, he was later permitted to bowl after making a few changes in his action.\n\nDananjaya's suspicious action came under the scanner of the match officials during the first Test between Sri Lanka and New Zealand in Galle last month. Dananjaya picked up a five-wicket haul in the first innings of the Test match and later finished with a total of six wickets under his belt. He was subsequently reported by the match officials and underwent an independent assessment to check the legality of his bowling action in Chennai on August 29.\n\nThe assessment ruled out that Dananjaya's bowling action was illegal prompting ICC to hand him a 12-month ban. The spinner cannot bowl in international cricket for next one year and can appear for reassessment only after the expiration of the ban. Dananjaya had missed the second Test after being reported for his action.\n\nDananjaya made his international debut for Sri Lanka in September 2012 in a T20I match against New Zealand.
