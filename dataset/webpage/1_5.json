{"Matthew Aylmer died in London.": [{"url": "http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/whitworth_aylmer_matthew_7E.html", "page_content": "WHITWORTH-AYLMER, MATTHEW, 5th Baron AYLMER, army officer and colonial administrator; b. 24 May 1775, the eldest of five children of Henry Aylmer, 4th Baron Aylmer, and Catherine Whitworth; m. 28 July or 4 Aug. 1801 Louisa Anne Call, daughter of Sir John Call; they had no children; d. 23 Feb. 1850 in London.\n\nMatthew Aylmer was only 10 when he succeeded his father in the ancient Irish barony of Aylmer and 12 when he entered the 49th Foot as an ensign. He became a lieutenant in 1791 and a captain in 1794. In 1798 he participated in an abortive British raid on Ostend (Belgium), was captured, and spent six months in a French prison. He won high praise from his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Brock*, for his role in the battle of Egmont-op-Zee (more properly Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands) in 1799. Two years later he rose to the rank of major in the 85th Foot, and in 1802 to lieutenant-colonel; however, he was then placed on half pay until June 1803 when he joined the Coldstream Foot Guards. On 25 July 1810 he became a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the king and on 4 June 1813 a major-general. He served as the assistant \u2013 and then from January 1812 as the deputy \u2013 adjutant general to Lord Wellington\u2019s army and commanded a brigade in several major battles of the Peninsular War, during which he was awarded the Military Cross with one clasp. He was given a kcb on 2 Jan. 1815 and knighted on 6 June. In 1814 he had been appointed adjutant general of the British forces in Ireland, where he remained until 1823. From 1823 to 1830 he was without employment and spent much of his time wandering across Switzerland and Italy. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 May 1825 and that year, upon the death of his uncle, the Earl of Whitworth, he changed his family name to Whitworth-Aylmer. He was made colonel of the 56th Foot in 1827 and transferred to the 18th Foot five years later.\n\nAylmer\u2019s enforced idleness ended when Sir James Kempt* resigned the administration of Lower Canada. In June 1830 the secretary of state for the colonies, Sir George Murray, who had also served with Wellington in the Peninsular War, offered the position to Aylmer. On 11 August Aylmer was appointed commander of the forces in North America, and on 13 October he landed at Quebec; he assumed control of the administration one week later. His commission as governor-in-chief was dated 24 Nov. 1830, but it was not formally registered at Quebec until 12 Feb. 1831. Aylmer had few obvious qualifications for his position; he had never served as a civil administrator, he had no political experience, and he came to Lower Canada, by his own admission, \u201ca perfect stranger to all that relates to the country.\u201d Yet Murray\u2019s choice was based on more than friendship. Aylmer was one of the more distinguished and capable officers of his rank, he was a francophile, and, as Louis-Joseph Papineau* noted, he spoke French \u201cwith the greatest ease and elegance.\u201d Although leaning to the conservative side in British politics, he was not a partisan, and the reformers in the Canadas, reassured by their contacts in Britain, received him as \u201can able and clever man conciliatory in his disposition, liberal in his principles, and cincerely [sic] anxious to do good.\u201d\n\nRecognizing his lack of knowledge, Aylmer none the less predicted that he would soon \u201cbe out of the Awkward Squad.\u201d He embarked on a series of tours which eventually took him to every part of Lower Canada, and he pronounced himself pleased with \u201cthe country, the people and the Climate.\u201d He and Lady Aylmer took their viceregal responsibilities seriously, contributing generously to a variety of causes, such as an emigrant fund, the Female Orphan Asylum, and the Quebec Driving Club (one of a number of organizations of which Lady Aylmer became patroness). They sought to foster the arts and culture, and attended many community activities, from ploughing matches to annual races in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res where Aylmer donated a silver cup to be awarded for a horse bred within the province. A wealthy man, Aylmer entertained frequently and lavishly at the Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Louis, the governor\u2019s residence; yet he avoided the error \u201cinto which most of our Governors have fallen . . . ,\u201d noted the Montreal reform newspaper, the Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser, \u201cof attempting to impress on the minds of the \u2018natives\u2019 a something transatlantically superior pertaining to themselves.\u201d During a visit to the Indian reserve at Lac des Deux Montagnes he joined in the dancing when \u201cobliged\u201d to do so.\n\nAylmer wished particularly to convince French Canadians of his benevolence. Shortly after his arrival he donated money for a tablet over the spot \u201cwhere lay the remains of brave Montcalm [Louis-Joseph de Montcalm*].\u201d He disagreed vehemently with those who advocated a policy of assimilation, arguing that there were not British subjects \u201cmore loyal and true \u2013 than the People of Lower Canada\u201d and that assimilation would weaken their loyalty and drive them into the arms of the United States. He defended the seigneurial system and sought permission to grant seigneurial lands under crown control to French Canadians who could not afford to purchase on freehold tenure. He exhibited a genuine desire to distribute government patronage with the utmost impartiality, reintegrating militia officers whom a predecessor, Lord Dalhousie [Ramsay], had dismissed for opposition to the administration, increasing the number of French Canadians on the bench, ensuring a balance between francophones and anglophones on the commission of the peace, and making 8 of his first 14 appointees to the Legislative Council French Canadians. In 1831, to prove that he was \u201cfree of all party connections,\u201d he offered seats on the Executive Council to Patriote leaders Papineau and John Neilson. Although both refused, Aylmer successively appointed the francophone reform members of the House of Assembly Philippe Panet*, Dominique Mondelet*, and Hugues Heney. Undeniably, he did not go far enough; the Legislative and Executive councils and the high echelons of the civil service continued to be dominated by anglophones unsympathetic to the demands of the assembly. None the less, he went as far as, and at times farther than, his superiors in London wanted and, at least initially, he convinced Papineau that \u201che likes and desires the good of the province.\u201d\n\nThe legislature met for the first time under Aylmer in January 1831 when, labouring under \u201ca severe indisposition,\u201d he delivered his speech from the throne \u201cliterally from my bed.\u201d Throughout the session he worked diligently to remedy the grievances of the assembly, many of which, he admitted, were \u201cwell founded.\u201d He introduced economies in the civil service, presented nearly all the executive documents requested by the assembly, protested to the British government delays in examining reserved colonial legislation, refused to bend regulations for interested parties, demanded more rigorous standards in accounting for public funds, launched an investigation of abuses in the land-grant system, and induced the judges (with the exception of Chief Justice Jonathan Sewell) not to attend the Legislative Council while the Colonial Office deliberated on a long-standing demand for their exclusion from that body. In proroguing the legislature in March, he enquired for \u201cany stray complaint\u201d which the assembly had neglected.\n\nAylmer\u2019s most controversial effort to appease came after the assembly petitioned for the dismissal of Attorney General James Stuart*, an outspoken opponent of the Patriote party, at the end of the session. Under pressure from the assembly, in September Aylmer suspended Stuart pending adjudication of its charges in Britain. Reprimanded by the Colonial Office for suspending Stuart before he was given the opportunity to defend himself in the assembly, Aylmer rightly pointed out that not to have acted would have provoked \u201cthe utmost degree of ferment and agitation.\u201d In November 1832 the Colonial Office dismissed Stuart, who unsuccessfully challenged Aylmer to a duel. He was hailed as a martyr by those among the British minority in the colony who believed that Aylmer \u201cdare not displease Mr. Citoyen Papineau by whom . . . he is held completely under cow.\u201d Aylmer\u2019s decision had enhanced his reputation with the reformers, however, and particularly with Papineau, who had earlier entertained the Aylmers at his country estate in June 1831. But though \u201con good (I may say cordial) terms\u201d with Papineau, Aylmer was aware that a great gulf existed between them on a number of questions.\n\nFor more than a decade the main preoccupation of the assembly had been to obtain control of the provincial revenues, including those reserved to the crown by the Quebec Revenue Act of 1774 [see Sir Francis Nathaniel Burton*]. Murray\u2019s Whig successor at the Colonial Office, Lord Goderich, instructed Aylmer to submit a pared-down list of estimates to the assembly and to request a permanent civil list preparatory to a surrender of the crown revenues. The assembly paid little attention to Goderich\u2019s estimates and none to his request for a civil list, although it did vote supplies for one year. Ignoring Aylmer\u2019s advice to the contrary and influenced by his parliamentary under-secretary, Lord Howick, Goderich introduced a bill into parliament in the summer of 1831 surrendering the crown revenues unconditionally, and in September he ordered Aylmer to reconvene the legislature and again request a comparatively modest civil list. The assembly, however, refused salaries to several officials on Goderich\u2019s list and, when Aylmer foolishly tried to coerce it by hinting that he would reserve any bill deviating from Goderich\u2019s intentions, it refused permanent salaries to any officials. It seems unlikely that Goderich\u2019s proposals, which were rejected by 42 to 9, would have been accepted by the assembly even had Aylmer been more astute, and the disappointed governor closed the session in late February 1832, acknowledging that his friendly relations with the leaders of the Patriote party had been sorely strained.\n\nIn 1832 deterioration of those relations accelerated after three French-speaking Canadians were shot by British troops on 21 May during a turbulent by-election in Montreal [see Daniel Tracey*]. Aylmer\u2019s sympathies lay with the soldiers, and although he wrote to Papineau regretting the deaths, he refused to intervene in the subsequent judicial process, even when Papineau requested a military inquiry. He encouraged Solicitor General Charles Richard Ogden* to bring the case before a grand jury but later publicly praised the jury\u2019s exoneration of the military. Thereafter Papineau pointedly declined to attend receptions at the Ch\u00e2teau.\n\nThe anger of the Patriote party was fuelled by a cholera epidemic which in 1832 killed more than 7,000 people in the colony. Aylmer had prepared for the outbreak by persuading the legislature to establish a quarantine station at Grosse \u00cele and a board of health at Quebec and to authorize such facilities elsewhere when necessary. Although Aylmer conscientiously enforced the quarantine regulations and issued money to the boards of health and the Montreal Emigrant Society, the measures proved wholly inadequate. Moreover, by insisting that only the law officers of the crown should prosecute he hindered the work of the boards, and by encouraging flight to reduce the incidence of cholera in the cities he contributed to the spread of the disease. Yet, on balance, he did not deserve the censure of the assembly, which also criticized him for issuing funds without its approval and for failing to control the influx of immigrants. In fact, Aylmer did wish to limit immigration and proposed to raise money by a tax on immigrants. When the assembly met in November 1832, it was in an angry mood; it declared Mondelet\u2019s seat vacant on his appointment to the Executive Council, passed a supply bill making no provision for a civil list, which the Legislative Council felt compelled to reject, and adopted an address, similar to one it had itself rejected in the previous session, demanding an elective legislative council.\n\nTo Aylmer these actions demonstrated intransigence, and he requested authorization from London to use the unappropriated funds surrendered to the legislature by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act of 1831. Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley, later Lord Stanley, who replaced Goderich at the Colonial Office in April 1833, sympathized but would not act until the assembly had been given an opportunity to reconsider. Consequently, when Aylmer reconvened the legislature in January 1834 he virtually invited a confrontation. He refused to grant the assembly contingency funds of \u00a37,000 and reserved 11 of the 12 bills passed by the legislature, disallowing the 12th. In return the assembly refused to vote supplies and passed 92 resolutions of grievance, including one demanding the governor\u2019s recall. Asserting that the resolutions were tantamount to a \u201cDeclaration of Independence,\u201d Aylmer sent to Stanley a draft bill restoring to the government control over the revenues surrendered to the assembly by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act. Stanley was prepared to rescind Goderich\u2019s act, and he referred the 92 resolutions to a select committee of the House of Commons, which he assumed would exonerate Aylmer. But Stanley was replaced in June 1834 by Thomas Spring-Rice, an easy-going Irish Whig, who was determined to avoid confrontation. Spring-Rice persuaded the Commons committee to attribute the conflict in Lower Canada simply to \u201cmutual misconceptions.\u201d After meeting with delegates from the assembly, he authorized Aylmer in September to borrow \u00a331,000 from the military chest for unpaid salaries, assuming (erroneously) that the assembly would agree to repay the loan. Aylmer was dismayed by Spring-Rice\u2019s actions and by the failure of the select committee to vindicate his conduct.\n\nIronically, Aylmer had led the Colonial Office to adopt a more conciliatory policy by insisting that the radicals in the assembly were losing support. During the sessions of 1833 and 1834 a rift had developed within the Patriote party, and Aylmer sought to exploit it, in particular by cultivating the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, which opposed the policies of the radicals. Although a devout member of the Church of England, Aylmer was unusually tolerant in his religious views, wishing, for example, to alter the oath taken by justices of the peace so that he could appoint Jewish magistrates [see Aaron Ezekiel Hart*]. He attended mass in the Roman Catholic cathedral as well as in his own, refused to go to the services of a local Anglican priest who had protested Aylmer\u2019s giving pecuniary aid to the Catholic Church, offered the Ursulines of Quebec refuge in the Ch\u00e2teau when a fire broke out in their convent, recommended that the Roman Catholic bishop be appointed to the Executive Council, and discouraged the Colonial Office from interfering with the Sulpician estates. In addition to cultivating the church, Aylmer deliberately chose his nominees for government posts from among the more conservative and \u201crespectable\u201d members of the Patriote party.\n\nAylmer\u2019s appointments, however, had the effect of weakening the moderates in the assembly, since appointees lost their seats. In any case Aylmer was himself an inadequate instrument for multiplying vendus. Progressively disenchanted with what he considered to be the ignorance and ingratitude of French Canadians, he had begun by September 1832 to argue that \u201cBritish influence in Lower Canada . . . must ere long be paramount\u201d and that French Canadians must \u201cfinally reconcile themselves to a fate which cannot be averted.\u201d In October he warned Sir John Colborne*, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, that \u201cwhen the king\u2019s Subjects are spoken of as Foreigners and the Canadians as a Nation held in subjection by another Nation, it becomes the constituted Authorities to be upon their Guard.\u201d By the spring of 1834 he was convinced that so long as the assembly was composed largely of French Canadians \u201cthe Constitution of the Province . . . will never work beneficially.\u201d After the passage of the 92 Resolutions his primary concern was to reconcile the American-born population in the Eastern Townships and the rapidly growing Irish communities in Montreal and Quebec by appointing representatives from both groups to positions of importance. In June 1835 he strongly endorsed the application of \u201can association of gentlemen\u201d from the townships for permission to purchase a large quantity of land on terms similar to those given to the British American Land Company [see Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt*], despite vehement opposition from the assembly.\n\nGradually, in fact, Aylmer had come under the influence of the old official group. In April 1834 he appointed David Chisholme, one of Dalhousie\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, coroner of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. When John Fletcher was unable to accept a promotion on the bench suggested as recompense for \u201cthe persecution of the House of Assembly to which he has been exposed for a series of years,\u201d Aylmer recommended Samuel Gale*, who had acted as Dalhousie\u2019s agent in England in 1828 and served as counsel to the officers in command during the Montreal \u201cmassacre.\u201d This recommendation encountered strong opposition at the Colonial Office but was accepted under pressure from Aylmer on condition that the next vacancy would be given to a French Canadian.\n\nGale\u2019s appointment alienated many moderates on both sides. Aylmer added to his unpopularity by refusing money to Montreal during a second outbreak of cholera in 1834 and by retreating to the governor\u2019s cottage at William Henry (Sorel) during the height of the outbreak. Late that year the radicals won a sweeping victory at the polls, virtually eliminating the moderates from the assembly. Aylmer was not displeased with this result, arguing that it had \u201croused a feeling (hitherto dormant) in the British Population,\u201d which might, however, \u201clead to very serious results, unless prudently managed.\u201d He enthusiastically approved the formation of militant constitutional associations at Quebec and Montreal, and warned that the British minority were no longer prepared to accept domination by the assembly. He blamed the Patriote victory on \u201cthe Complacency with which the Canada Committee [of 1834] listened to sham Grievances\u201d and predicted that the new assembly would be less reasonable than its predecessor. When the assembly met in February 1835, he made his prediction reality by refusing to issue money for the assembly\u2019s contingencies. In return the house again refused supplies and complained that Aylmer was prejudiced against French Canadians. On 18 March Aylmer prorogued the legislature and called upon Britain to find a solution to the constitutional and financial impasse.\n\nThe solution adopted by the Colonial Office was to replace Aylmer. Spring-Rice had begun to search for a successor in the autumn of 1834 and had promised Aylmer another government if he would resign. But Aylmer wanted exoneration, and he suggested sending a parliamentary commission to examine the assembly\u2019s charges. In April 1835 a three-man commission was appointed, but its head, Lord Gosford [Acheson], would also become Aylmer\u2019s replacement. Aylmer bitterly resented his dismissal and was further antagonized when Gosford, who assumed control of the government on 24 Aug. 1835, dissociated himself from his predecessor. Aylmer\u2019s mood was not improved by a terrifying return voyage, described by Lady Aylmer in Narrative of the passage of the \u201cPique\u201d across the Atlantic (London, 1837). Once in England, he attempted without success to obtain approval of his conduct by refusing appointment as commander of the forces in Ireland unless he got it. However, he did coerce the government into awarding him a gcb, on 10 Sept. 1836, and on 23 Nov. 1841 he became a general, but he never obtained an English peerage, to which he felt entitled, or another administrative post. On 23 Feb. 1850 he died in his London home of an aneurysm of the heart.\n\nOn leaving the colony Aylmer had expressed regret that his \u201canxious endeavours to promote the general welfare of Lower Canada, should have fallen (as they have) so far short\u201d of his initial expectations and burst into tears when the small crowd which had gathered at the wharf cheered. In truth, Aylmer is a tragic figure. He was well meaning and as competent as most of the military men sent to govern British North America following the Napoleonic Wars. But Lower Canada required a governor with political skill, and as Aylmer had noted in October 1831, \u201cI cannot look for advice, or support here, beyond the circle of my own family composed of Soldiers like myself; & on . . . [the other] side of the Water I am totally destitute of Political Connexions.\u201d Largely unprepared, he had found himself \u201ccalled upon all at once to contend against those whose lives have been devoted to the Study of Law & Politics.\u201d The Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser declared that Aylmer had \u201cearned a niche in Canadian History, alongside of the Craigs [Sir James Henry Craig*] and Dalhousies, and gained for himself the execration of half-a-million people\u201d; the Whigs blamed him for the failure of their conciliatory policy; and historians sympathetic to them, such as Helen Taft Manning, have echoed this assessment. Yet, although Aylmer was guilty of serious errors of judgement, much of the criticism of him is unfair. Many of his blunders, as historian Fernand Ouellet notes, \u201cwere more or less provoked,\u201d and he never became as violently francophobic as Craig or Dalhousie, never lost his temper in public, never closed the doors of the Ch\u00e2teau to his opponents. He contributed to ethnic polarization in Lower Canada, but he was not responsible for it, nor could he, any more than Gosford, a civilian with considerable political experience, have prevented its development. Moreover, Aylmer was handicapped by the rapid changes of government in Britain during the early 1830s, serving under five secretaries whose views on Lower Canada differed sharply. Without \u201cPolitical Connexions\u201d in Britain, he was sacrificed to facilitate accommodation with the Lower Canadian assembly; the sacrifice, ironically, was in vain for by then the train of events leading to the rebellions of 1837\u201338 was probably irreversible.\n\nPhillip Buckner"}, {"url": "https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-13995", "page_content": "Admiral Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (ca.1655-1720)\n\nA three-quarter length portrait to the left, showing Aylmer in armour, wearing a red sash and brown full-bottomed wig.\n\nAfter military service in Ireland and at Tangier, Matthew Aylmer began his naval career as a midshipman in October 1677.

He was further advanced by his patron, Admiral Arthur Herbert, to captain of the \u2018Chatham\u2019 and other commands followed. The Glorious Revolution of 1688\u201389 proved favourable to Aylmer\u2019s career. He was appointed to the \u2018Mary\u2019 on 22 December 1688 and saw action in her at the Battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689, where the ship sustained significant damage.

He was promoted rear-admiral on 8 February 1693 and vice-admiral that June. Political machinations at the Admiralty saw him withdraw from active service in November 1699, but he was recalled as commander-in-chief between November 1709 and January 1711 and again between 1714 and 1718. He was appointed governor of Greenwich Hospital on 6 November 1714.

As Catholics they suffered during the Civil Wars, when Aylmer\u2019s grandfather was imprisoned, but were restored at least to some of their lands in 1661. Aylmer\u2019s father, who received a baronetcy at this time, showed a loyalty to King Charles II which extended to a willingness to compromise with the Protestant establishment: he subscribed to the \u2018protestation and remonstrance\u2019 of Catholic gentry in 1661 repudiating papal authority, and both his younger sons, Matthew and George, conformed to the Established Church. As a result, Christopher came into conflict both with his own father, and then with his eldest son, Gerald, who disputed title to the family inheritance before eventually succeeding as 2nd Bt. Gerald then jeopardized the family estates by joining James II in 1689. In October 1690 Matthew Aylmer petitioned for a grant of the property his brother had forfeited, but the outcome is not known.\n\nAs the second son, Matthew embarked on a military career, as did his younger brother, George (d. 1689). He seems to have become a client of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, in whose regiment he was commissioned. After the disbandment of the regiment, family history notes that Aylmer raised troops in Munster for the Dutch, before obtaining a commission in a Tangier regiment in 1677, and then switching to a naval career. While on active service at Tangier, he was raised to captain by Admiral Arthur Herbert\u2020, and continued to serve until the evacuation of the garrison in 1683\u20134. In James II\u2019s reign Aylmer saw service at sea against Monmouth\u2019s rebels, before receiving promotion in the army. Given his Catholic antecedents, and his elder brother\u2019s commitment to Rome, Aylmer\u2019s position was fraught with possibilities and dangers; in July 1687 he received a dispensation from taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy while acting as an army captain. However, in 1688 he showed unequivocal support for the Prince of Orange, and was a leading participant in the \u2018navy plot\u2019 against James II.\n\nAylmer\u2019s main patron at this time appears to have been Edward Russell*. In February 1690, a report that John Hill had been appointed to the Navy Board brought a missive from Russell to Secretary Nottingham (Daniel Finch\u2020), extolling Aylmer\u2019s qualifications for such a post and recalling previous service to the Williamite cause. He was considered for a flag as early as August 1690, but it was as a captain that he was given command of the Mediterranean fleet in 1690\u20131, although he was allowed to retain his lieutenant-colonelcy in the army. In August 1691 Aylmer sought command of the West Indies squadron, but had to wait until 1693 for a flag. He may have tried to take advantage of the Smyrna fleet debacle in 1693, because Sir Ralph Delaval* wrote acidly, \u2018there was not a flag at the council of war so very fond of coming into port as Mr Aylmer who I suppose doth all the good is in his nature but his hand is to every resolution of our councils of war which I hope to see him deny\u2019. The following year saw his appointment to the Navy Board.\n\nAylmer\u2019s first foray into electoral politics ended in a double return at the Portsmouth by-election of 1695 (after Russell himself had created the vacancy by opting to sit for Cambridgeshire). The Commons on 24 Jan. 1696 voted this a void election, and even with Russell\u2019s backing Aylmer\u2019s interest proved insufficient to overcome that of John Gibson, the town\u2019s lieutenant-governor, who was returned unopposed at the second by-election. Early in 1696, the deposition of the Assassination Plotter Peter Cook suggested that the Jacobites thought they could \u2018depend\u2019 upon Aylmer, but nothing incriminating was revealed. In May 1697 he subscribed \u00a31,000 to the contract for lending money to circulate Exchequer bills. The death of James Chadwick* left a vacancy for Dover, a borough in which the navy could exercise considerable influence. Aylmer approached the corporation in June 1697 and, despite snide references by Philip Papillon* to Aylmer\u2019s Irishness and lack of any visible estate in the town or county, he was returned on 15 Dec., taking his seat on the 20th.\n\nIn February 1698 Aylmer was given command of the squadron destined for the Mediterranean. At this point he was \u2018in town\u2019, and presumably attending Parliament. Delays in supplying the fleet, owing to a shortage of funds, meant that he did not sail until September, which may have allowed him to consolidate his position in Dover with timely applications to the government for money to repair Dover harbour. Before leaving England he was re-elected, and was listed as a placeman in September 1698 and as a placeman on a comparative analysis of the old and new Parliaments. In an addendum to this list he was marked as absent, and the House officially excused his attendance on 7 Mar. 1699 because of his duties at sea and as envoy to various North African states.\n\nDuring Aylmer\u2019s absence (he returned at the end of October 1699) there was a lengthy parliamentary inquiry into mismanagements at the Admiralty, one of the allegations being the delay in fitting out Aylmer\u2019s squadron. Other, more specific, charges against him included his detention of the Centurion at Cadiz in order to force its commander, Price, to concede a large share of his profits, and Aylmer\u2019s role as victualler of his own fleet while in the Mediterranean. Opinion divided on party lines as to his culpability. Sir Richard Cocks, 2nd Bt.*, thought Price\u2019s charges \u2018mere malice, nothing in it at all\u2019, while James Vernon I* reported that the House had considered, in regard to victualling, that Aylmer was \u2018too honest and too considerate\u2019 to have submitted false accounts and profit thereby. However, Robert Harley\u2019s* papers contain the draft of a resolution condemning Aylmer for corruption and breach of trust in detaining Price at Cadiz. This may well relate to the debate in the committee of the whole on 10 Mar. 1699, when Aylmer was blamed, but the matter was \u2018let fall before they came to any question\u2019.\n\nWhile Aylmer was at sea during the summer of 1699 Orford resigned his place at the Admiralty. In discussions that followed there was talk of promoting George Churchill* to a flag senior to Aylmer, no doubt as part of the Earl of Marlborough\u2019s (John Churchill\u2020) rapprochement with the Court. Vernon felt that Aylmer might resign over this matter, possibly \u2018to give a handle for finding fault with the partialities of this commission of Admiralty, and to show the case is not much mended in that respect\u2019, and that the appointment of Churchill would be difficult to defend on the grounds of experience and seniority. In the event, Churchill went to the Admiralty in place of Sir Robert Rich, 2nd Bt.*, while Aylmer continued at the Navy Board. An analysis of the House into \u2018interests\u2019 in early 1700 listed Aylmer as a member of the Bedford/Orford connexion. This affiliation did not help him to obtain one of the limited number of peacetime commands, although his name was linked with a squadron going to the Straits. In March 1701 he was listed among those flag officers \u2018unemployed at sea\u2019. Aylmer\u2019s attention to constituency matters, such as his appointment on 12 Feb. 1700 to draft a bill to repair Dover harbour, ensured that he was returned at the election of January 1701; he even appears to have retained the naval interest at Dover although another Court supporter, Secretary of State Sir Charles Hedges*, was also returned. In the ensuing parliamentary session, Aylmer was listed among those thought likely to support the Court in February over the \u2018Great Mortgage\u2019.\n\nWhen Dover corporation rebuffed Hedges in the run-up to the election of December 1701, it was mostly because of Aylmer\u2019s \u2018neglect\u2019 of their interests. In comparison, he had been more attentive, particularly over the harbour. Aylmer was also solicitous for his own interests: hence a petition he signed with three other navy commissioners on 31 Dec. 1701, for the continuance of an allowance of \u00a380 p.a. for housing, in view of the fact that they could not be accommodated in government property. Aylmer had resided in the parish of St. Paul\u2019s, Covent Garden, since at least as early as 1694, moving from St. Martin\u2019s-in-the-Fields at some point after 1690, possibly coincidental with his appointment to the Navy Board in 1692. He had also purchased an estate near Dover, presumably by 1701 when he presented to an advowson at nearby East Langdon. On a list of the new Parliament, Harley classed him as a Whig. With fewer naval duties to perform, Aylmer was more active in the 1701\u20132 session, and was included on the drafting committee of a bill to encourage privateers. On a personal note he also assisted in the management of a private bill for the Fitzgerald and Plunkett families, with both of whom the Irish Aylmers were connected.\n\nAylmer had been appointed vice-admiral of the red in January 1702, but the death of William III saw his naval career at a standstill, following the Queen\u2019s decision to employ George Churchill in that place, and the consequent dispute about seniority which Vernon had predicted three years before. Aylmer was also left out of a revamped Navy Board, for which the governorship of Deal and nomination to the Kentish lieutenancy and the bench were poor recompense. Re-elected for Dover in 1702, in July he petitioned the Queen for a pension, such as had been given by William III to Admirals Delaval and Killigrew (Henry*). Aylmer considered his position to be similar, in that he had been displaced from being vice-admiral of the red by Churchill and then removed from the Navy Board, whereas the official view was that Aylmer had declined to serve and had as a consequence also lost his post as a navy commissioner. Although L\u2019Hermitage had described him in February 1702 as a Whig and a creature of Orford, Aylmer was spotted caballing in September with Lord Burlington (Hon. Charles Boyle I*), Lord Somers (Sir John*), Lord Halifax (Charles Montagu*), (Sir) Thomas Felton* (4th Bt.) and \u2018Mr Hopkins [?Thomas*]\u2019. Nothing came of these discussions between overlooked politicians, but Aylmer remained a Whig, voting on 13 Feb. 1703 to agree with the Lords\u2019 amendments enlarging the time for taking the oaths of abjuration. Forecast as an opponent of the Tack, he did not vote for it on 28 Nov. 1704.\n\nIn January 1705 there was a rumour that Aylmer would serve at sea again the following summer, and in a conciliatory move the Treasury ordered a stay of prosecution against Aylmer and Sir Basill Dixwell, 2nd Bt.*, for failure to account for money given to them to repair Dover harbour. Returned again at the 1705 election, Aylmer was described in an analysis of the new House as a \u2018High Church Courtier\u2019, and his name appears on a list of placemen for 1705, presumably because of his governorship at Deal. On 25 Oct. 1705 he voted for the Court candidate as Speaker, and later in the session, on 18 Feb. 1706, supported the Court in the proceedings on the \u2018place clause\u2019 of the regency bill. He was more active in the Commons in this Parliament, his committee appointments again reflecting his interest in naval affairs, and in 1706 he presented a memorial to the Treasury on the desirability of the Navy Board taking over responsibility for Dover harbour.\n\nRe-elected in 1708, Aylmer was classed as a Whig on two lists of that year. He sought to capitalize on the swing towards the Whigs at this time and gain further preferment. Thus on 25 May, only a few weeks after the general election, he wrote to Marlborough to remind the Duke of a memorial delivered the previous winter, in which Aylmer had asked for the governorship of Greenwich Hospital, \u2018or to be allowed a subsistence\u2019. Since that post had been disposed of, Aylmer recounted the \u2018hardships under which I suffer, and not being conscious that I have done anything can deserve so particular a mark of severeness above all other officers\u2019. Marlborough seems to have responded favourably to this letter, which was referred to Lord Treasurer Godolphin (Sidney\u2020), although nothing was done immediately. In December 1708 a commission was made out for Aylmer as admiral of the fleet, which was superseded the following day. This was a device to provide Aylmer with a \u2018subsistence\u2019 on half pay at a high rank. In 1709 he supported the naturalization of the Palatines. With the Earl of Pembroke (Hon. Thomas Herbert\u2020) as Lord High Admiral, rumours began to circulate as early as March that the Admiralty would be put into a commission which would include Aylmer. The same rumours recurred in October and November, but when Orford was brought back into the Admiralty Aylmer was not one of the commissioners; instead he was given command of the fleet. This did not please everyone: Sir John Jennings* felt rather as Aylmer had done in 1702 when Churchill had been appointed, and Arthur Maynwaring* noted that \u2018the officers have no real value for Mr Aylmer, nor indeed for anyone now but for Jennings\u2019. As a consequence of his appointment Aylmer had to fight a by-election, but was returned unopposed. In the 1709\u201310 session he voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell.\n\nReturned again at the 1710 election, Aylmer soon lost his position as admiral and commander-in-chief of the fleet. Indeed, at the committee of elections on 22 Feb. 1711, both Aylmer and Jennings were \u2018severely criticized\u2019 for interfering at the election for Weymouth by treating the corporation on board ship. However, when the report came before the House on 17 Mar. no resolution critical of Aylmer was passed. The end of the session saw Aylmer appealing to Harley for repayment of the contingency money he had spent while equipping himself for service at sea the previous year and referring again to the hardships he had undergone. In the following session Aylmer voted on 7 Dec. 1711 for the \u2018No Peace without Spain\u2019 motion, but otherwise was not very active. In the 1713 session he was not present in the Commons to vote in the divisions of 18 June over the French commerce bill because he had gone to Deal Castle with Sir John Norris* (his son-in-law) to celebrate the marriage of his younger daughter to Hugh Fortescue*.\n\nNot only was Aylmer defeated at the 1713 general election, it was even felt necessary to scotch a rumour in the following January that he was a Catholic. However, he was soon back in favour after the Hanoverian succession. In October 1714 he was reported to have been made governor of Greenwich Hospital, a post he had long coveted, which \u2018is a very pretty post, and has a very pleasant house to dwell in\u2019. November saw him reappointed admiral of the fleet, and he regained his seat in the Commons at the 1715 general election. On a comparative analysis of the 1713 and 1715 Parliaments he was listed as a Whig. Aylmer continued as admiral until he exchanged the post for the honorific title of rear-admiral of England and an Irish peerage in 1718. He died at Greenwich on 18 Aug. 1720, although his will, dated in June that year, still gave his address as Covent Garden. In it he had appointed as executor his son Henry\u2020, an equerry to the King. Swift wrote off his compatriot as a violent partisan, but Aylmer seems to have been skilled at exploiting the situations available to him. His early naval career was marked by the smooth facility with which he moved between patrons, yet he managed to retain his seat at Dover even after the original backing of the Navy interest had been lost.\n\nRef Volumes: 1690-1715\n\nAuthor: Stuart Handley\n\nNotes"}, {"url": "http://www.famousamericans.net/mathewaylmer/", "page_content": "Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography, edited by James Grant Wilson, John Fiske and Stanley L.

Early in the following year he was advanced to the rank of Captain, and he appears to have served almost constantly during the next ten years on the coast of Algiers and in the Mediterranean.\n\nIn October 1688 he was appointed captain of HMS Swallow in the Thames, but at once gave in his allegiance to the cause of the Revolution. In 1690 he commanded the Royal Katherine, and, in the battle off Beachy Head, was one of the seconds to Sir Ralph Delaval who commanded the blue squadron. In 1692, still in the Royal Katherine, he was one of the seconds of the Commander-in-Chief at Barfleur. In February 1693 he was advanced to the rank of Rear Admiral, and to that of Vice Admiral in 1694, when he accompanied Admiral Russell to the Mediterranean, and was also appointed a Lord of the Admiralty. After the Treaty of Ryswick he was sent, in 1698, as Commander-in-Chief, again into the Mediterranean, principally to confirm the treaties with the regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers. He returned home towards the end of the following year.\n\nIn November 1699, being, it is said, dissatisfied at the appointment of Admiral Churchill to the Admiralty, he retired from active service, though he continued to act as one of the Commissioners of the Navy till July 1702. He took no part whatever in naval affairs beyond sitting in Parliament as Baron or Member for Dover, till after the death of Prince George, and the retirement of Churchill in November 1709, when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the fleet. In the following July, whilst cruising in the Soundings, he fell in with a French squadron and convoy, of which only one merchantman and the Superbe, of 56 guns, were captured. The rest escaped, owing, it was alleged, to the haziness of the weather. The want of success served the new ministry as an excuse to supersede him, which they did in January 1711.\n\nHe held no further command till the Accession of George I, when he was again appointed Commander-in-Chief, Ranger of Greenwich Park, and the second Governor of Greenwich Hospital. This office he held till his death, and during that time succeeded in establishing the hospital school for the sons of seamen, which gradually developed into a magnificent institution. In April 1717 he became one of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, but he resigned the appointment early the next year, when he was promoted to Rear Admiral of the United Kingdom, and at the same time raised to the peerage of Ireland as Lord Aylmer of Balrath. He had been elected Whig M.P. for Portsmouth in 1695, and for Dover in 1697, 1713, and 1715.\n\nA portrait, half-length, presented by his descendant, the fifth Lord Aylmer, is in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.\n\nAdmiral of the Fleet Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (ca. 1650 \u2013 18 August 1720), of Covent Garden, Westminster, and Westcliffe, near Dover, was an Anglo-Irish Royal Navy officer and Whig politician who sat in the English and British House of Commons between 1695 and 1720.\n\nAylmer was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support; the Prince's response ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.\n\nAylmer saw action at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689, at the Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690 and again at the Battle of Barfleur in May 1692 during the Nine Years' War.\n\nAylmer became Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709. However, when Aylmer met a French squadron and convoy, he was only able to capture one merchantman and the 56-gun Superbe: the new Harley Ministry used this failure as an excuse to remove him as Commander-in-Chief and did so a few months later. Following the accession of George I and the appointment of the Townshend Ministry, Aylmer was reappointed Commander-in-Chief on 5 November 1714. He was also appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital: in this post he founded the Royal Hospital School for the sons of seamen.\n\nEarly career\n\nAylmer was the second son of Sir Christopher Aylmer of Balrath, county Meath, and Margaret Aylmer (n\u00e9e Plunkett), daughter of Matthew Plunkett, 5th Baron Louth. He served briefly in the Army as Ensign of foot in the Duke of Buckingham\u2019s regiment from 1672 and then joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman in the galley HMS Charles in October 1677 before being promoted to lieutenant in April 1678. Promoted to commander on 19 January 1679, he became commanding officer of the sloop HMS Chatham and then transferred to the command of the prize ship HMS Date Tree in Summer 1679. He transferred again to the command of the fire ship HMS Castle in the Mediterranean Fleet later in the year, to the command of the fifth-rate HMS Swann on the Coast of Ireland in July 1680 and to the command of the fourth-rate HMS Tiger in the Mediterranean Fleet in January 1682, before becoming commanding officer of the galley HMS Charles in September 1685. Aylmer was a young officer of the \u201ccourtier type\u201d who benefited from the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham.\n\nPromoted to captain on 1 October 1688, Aylmer was given command of the fourth-rate HMS Swallow in the Thames; he was one of the captains who sent a letter to Prince William of Orange, who had just landed at Torbay, assuring the Prince of the captains' support. Indeed, he was perhaps the chief of the cabal. Aylmer followed up the letter with a visit to the Prince's headquarters and arranged that Lieutenant George Byng and Captain Anthony Hastings should accompany him during the visit. The Prince's warm response to the captains ultimately led to the Royal Navy switching allegiance to the Prince and the Glorious Revolution of November 1688.\n\nAylmer transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS Mary in December 1688 and was present at the French victory at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689 at an early stage of the Nine Years' War. His brother George Aylmer was killed during the battle.\n\nAylmer transferred again, this time to the command of the second-rate HMS Royal Katherine in Spring 1690 and was present at the French victory at Battle of Beachy Head in July 1690. He transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS Monck in the North Sea in Summer 1691 and then took command of the first-rate HMS London in Spring 1692. As Second Captain to Admiral Edward Russell, he saw action again at the tactically indecisive Battle of Barfleur in May 1692. As a captain, Aylmer was quite deferential to his Spanish partners during the War. Samuel Pepys believed that Aylmer should have been hanged for his habit of dipping his colours to Spanish Admirals.\n\nSenior command\n\nPromoted to rear admiral on 8 February 1693 and to vice admiral in June 1693, Aylmer hoisted his flag in the first-rate HMS Royal Sovereign and served under Admiral Edward Russell as second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet. He also became Whig Member of Parliament for Portsmouth at a by-election in 1695 but had to stand down when the House of Commons declared the by-election void in January 1696. Nevertheless, he was elected Whig Member of Parliament for Dover in December 1697. The Treaty of Ryswick was signed in September 1697, bringing the Nine Years' War to an end and, after a delay in fitting out his squadron, Aylmer went out into the Mediterranean, with his flag in the second-rate HMS Boyne, to ensure the treaty was being observed in September 1698; he then retired from active service in October 1699. In around 1700 he acquired Wallett's Court Manor at Westcliffe in Kent as a property in which he would live in retirement. He also had a property at No. 12 Great Piazza in Covent Garden.\n\nFollowing the death of Prince George (Queen Anne's consort), which brought Russell back to the Admiralty, Aylmer was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the Navy on 12 November 1709. He lost his Dover seat at the 1710 British general election which produced a landslide victory for the Tory party in the wake of the prosecution of Henry Sacheverell which Aylmer had supported. In July 1710, when Aylmer met a French squadron and convoy, he was only able to capture one merchantman and the 56-gun Superbe: the new Harley Ministry used this failure as an excuse to remove him as Commander-in-Chief and did so in January 1711.\n\nFollowing the accession of George I in August 1714, which led to the appointment of the Townshend Ministry in September 1714, Russell was back at the Admiralty again and Aylmer was reappointed Commander-in-Chief on 5 November 1714. Alymer was also appointed Governor of Greenwich Hospital on the same date: in this post he started to fund education for the sons of seamen from entry charges to the Painted Hall, pensioners' fines and proceeds from the sale of stores. The same day he was also appointed Ranger of Greenwich Park.\n\nAlymer recovered his seat in Parliament at Dover at the 1715 British general election which saw the Whigs win an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. He went on to join the Board of Admiralty led by the Earl of Berkeley, as Senior Naval Lord, in April 1717. He resigned his appointments as a member of the Admiralty Board and as Commander-in-Chief in March 1718 and was rewarded by being appointed Rear-Admiral of Great Britain and also being created Lord Aylmer of Balrath in the Peerage of Ireland on 1 May 1718.\n\nAylmer died at Queen's House in Greenwich on 18 August 1720 and was buried at St Alfege's Church in Greenwich.\n\nFamily\n\nIn circa 1680 Aylmer married Sarah Ellis; they had a son and two daughters.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Aylmer,_1st_Baron_Aylmer"}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Aylmer,_Matthew", "page_content": "\u200bAYLMER, MATTHEW, Lord Aylmer (d. 1720), admiral and commander-in-chief, was the second son of Sir Christopher Aylmer of Balrath, county Meath, and entered the navy under the protection of the Duke of Buckingham, as a lieutenant, in 1678.

Later it was suggested that the portrait was not definitely Aylmer, although it was thought to look like him (\u2018A preliminary descriptive catalogue of the portraits in the National Maritime Museum\u2019, 1961). The features, however, seem to agree with those shown in the mezzotint, the artist of which is not known (PAF3314), although less with the 19th-century copy after Lely (circa 1678) in the Greenwich Hospital Collection (BHC2521), presented by the fifth Lord Aylmer in 1837.\n\n\n\nHe wears a grey silk coat, rust drape and a brown full-bottomed wig. The Battle of Barfleur, 19 May 1692, is shown in the background with Aylmer\u2019s ship, the \u2018London\u2019, 96 guns. The Rear-Admiral of the Blue\u2019s flag may have been added later. If the suggested date for the portrait is1692\u201393 is correct, the attribution to Richardson may be questionable as most of his known works date from after 1700.\n\n\n\nIn 1714 Aylmer became the second Governor of Greenwich Hospital. He was also Ranger of Greenwich Park and lived in the Queen\u2019s House where he died (he entertained George I there on several occasions). He founded the Hospital School for the sons of seamen at Greenwich."}], "Matthew Aylmer was recalled in 1790.": [{"url": "https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-13995", "page_content": "Admiral Matthew Aylmer, 1st Baron Aylmer (ca.1655-1720)\n\nA three-quarter length portrait to the left, showing Aylmer in armour, wearing a red sash and brown full-bottomed wig.\n\nAfter military service in Ireland and at Tangier, Matthew Aylmer began his naval career as a midshipman in October 1677. He served in the galley \u2018Charles\u2019 in the Mediterranean, becoming lieutenant in her in April the following year. He was further advanced by his patron, Admiral Arthur Herbert, to captain of the \u2018Chatham\u2019 and other commands followed. The Glorious Revolution of 1688\u201389 proved favourable to Aylmer\u2019s career. He was appointed to the \u2018Mary\u2019 on 22 December 1688 and saw action in her at the Battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689, where the ship sustained significant damage. He commanded the \u2018Royal Katherine\u2019 at the Battle of Beachy Head in 1690 and the \u2018London\u2019 at the Battle of Barfleur in 1692. He was promoted rear-admiral on 8 February 1693 and vice-admiral that June. Political machinations at the Admiralty saw him withdraw from active service in November 1699, but he was recalled as commander-in-chief between November 1709 and January 1711 and again between 1714 and 1718. He was appointed governor of Greenwich Hospital on 6 November 1714. He died in post at the Queen\u2019s House on 18 August 1720; he is buried in St Alfege\u2019s Church.\n\n\n\nThis is a copy of a portrait by Lely which was in possession of the fifth Lord Aylmer in the early 19th century and is presumed to have been made shortly before he presented it to the Naval Gallery of Greenwich Hospital in 1837. It is likely he had it made for that purpose, to commemorate the sitter's role as second Governor of the Hospital from 1714 to his death.

He became a lieutenant in 1791 and a captain in 1794. In 1798 he participated in an abortive British raid on Ostend (Belgium), was captured, and spent six months in a French prison. He won high praise from his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Isaac Brock*, for his role in the battle of Egmont-op-Zee (more properly Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands) in 1799. Two years later he rose to the rank of major in the 85th Foot, and in 1802 to lieutenant-colonel; however, he was then placed on half pay until June 1803 when he joined the Coldstream Foot Guards. On 25 July 1810 he became a colonel and an aide-de-camp to the king and on 4 June 1813 a major-general. He served as the assistant \u2013 and then from January 1812 as the deputy \u2013 adjutant general to Lord Wellington\u2019s army and commanded a brigade in several major battles of the Peninsular War, during which he was awarded the Military Cross with one clasp. He was given a kcb on 2 Jan. 1815 and knighted on 6 June. In 1814 he had been appointed adjutant general of the British forces in Ireland, where he remained until 1823. From 1823 to 1830 he was without employment and spent much of his time wandering across Switzerland and Italy. He was promoted lieutenant-general on 27 May 1825 and that year, upon the death of his uncle, the Earl of Whitworth, he changed his family name to Whitworth-Aylmer. He was made colonel of the 56th Foot in 1827 and transferred to the 18th Foot five years later.\n\nAylmer\u2019s enforced idleness ended when Sir James Kempt* resigned the administration of Lower Canada. In June 1830 the secretary of state for the colonies, Sir George Murray, who had also served with Wellington in the Peninsular War, offered the position to Aylmer. On 11 August Aylmer was appointed commander of the forces in North America, and on 13 October he landed at Quebec; he assumed control of the administration one week later. His commission as governor-in-chief was dated 24 Nov. 1830, but it was not formally registered at Quebec until 12 Feb. 1831. Aylmer had few obvious qualifications for his position; he had never served as a civil administrator, he had no political experience, and he came to Lower Canada, by his own admission, \u201ca perfect stranger to all that relates to the country.\u201d Yet Murray\u2019s choice was based on more than friendship. Aylmer was one of the more distinguished and capable officers of his rank, he was a francophile, and, as Louis-Joseph Papineau* noted, he spoke French \u201cwith the greatest ease and elegance.\u201d Although leaning to the conservative side in British politics, he was not a partisan, and the reformers in the Canadas, reassured by their contacts in Britain, received him as \u201can able and clever man conciliatory in his disposition, liberal in his principles, and cincerely [sic] anxious to do good.\u201d\n\nRecognizing his lack of knowledge, Aylmer none the less predicted that he would soon \u201cbe out of the Awkward Squad.\u201d He embarked on a series of tours which eventually took him to every part of Lower Canada, and he pronounced himself pleased with \u201cthe country, the people and the Climate.\u201d He and Lady Aylmer took their viceregal responsibilities seriously, contributing generously to a variety of causes, such as an emigrant fund, the Female Orphan Asylum, and the Quebec Driving Club (one of a number of organizations of which Lady Aylmer became patroness). They sought to foster the arts and culture, and attended many community activities, from ploughing matches to annual races in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res where Aylmer donated a silver cup to be awarded for a horse bred within the province. A wealthy man, Aylmer entertained frequently and lavishly at the Ch\u00e2teau Saint-Louis, the governor\u2019s residence; yet he avoided the error \u201cinto which most of our Governors have fallen . . . ,\u201d noted the Montreal reform newspaper, the Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser, \u201cof attempting to impress on the minds of the \u2018natives\u2019 a something transatlantically superior pertaining to themselves.\u201d During a visit to the Indian reserve at Lac des Deux Montagnes he joined in the dancing when \u201cobliged\u201d to do so.\n\nAylmer wished particularly to convince French Canadians of his benevolence. Shortly after his arrival he donated money for a tablet over the spot \u201cwhere lay the remains of brave Montcalm [Louis-Joseph de Montcalm*].\u201d He disagreed vehemently with those who advocated a policy of assimilation, arguing that there were not British subjects \u201cmore loyal and true \u2013 than the People of Lower Canada\u201d and that assimilation would weaken their loyalty and drive them into the arms of the United States. He defended the seigneurial system and sought permission to grant seigneurial lands under crown control to French Canadians who could not afford to purchase on freehold tenure. He exhibited a genuine desire to distribute government patronage with the utmost impartiality, reintegrating militia officers whom a predecessor, Lord Dalhousie [Ramsay], had dismissed for opposition to the administration, increasing the number of French Canadians on the bench, ensuring a balance between francophones and anglophones on the commission of the peace, and making 8 of his first 14 appointees to the Legislative Council French Canadians. In 1831, to prove that he was \u201cfree of all party connections,\u201d he offered seats on the Executive Council to Patriote leaders Papineau and John Neilson. Although both refused, Aylmer successively appointed the francophone reform members of the House of Assembly Philippe Panet*, Dominique Mondelet*, and Hugues Heney. Undeniably, he did not go far enough; the Legislative and Executive councils and the high echelons of the civil service continued to be dominated by anglophones unsympathetic to the demands of the assembly. None the less, he went as far as, and at times farther than, his superiors in London wanted and, at least initially, he convinced Papineau that \u201che likes and desires the good of the province.\u201d\n\nThe legislature met for the first time under Aylmer in January 1831 when, labouring under \u201ca severe indisposition,\u201d he delivered his speech from the throne \u201cliterally from my bed.\u201d Throughout the session he worked diligently to remedy the grievances of the assembly, many of which, he admitted, were \u201cwell founded.\u201d He introduced economies in the civil service, presented nearly all the executive documents requested by the assembly, protested to the British government delays in examining reserved colonial legislation, refused to bend regulations for interested parties, demanded more rigorous standards in accounting for public funds, launched an investigation of abuses in the land-grant system, and induced the judges (with the exception of Chief Justice Jonathan Sewell) not to attend the Legislative Council while the Colonial Office deliberated on a long-standing demand for their exclusion from that body. In proroguing the legislature in March, he enquired for \u201cany stray complaint\u201d which the assembly had neglected.\n\nAylmer\u2019s most controversial effort to appease came after the assembly petitioned for the dismissal of Attorney General James Stuart*, an outspoken opponent of the Patriote party, at the end of the session. Under pressure from the assembly, in September Aylmer suspended Stuart pending adjudication of its charges in Britain. Reprimanded by the Colonial Office for suspending Stuart before he was given the opportunity to defend himself in the assembly, Aylmer rightly pointed out that not to have acted would have provoked \u201cthe utmost degree of ferment and agitation.\u201d In November 1832 the Colonial Office dismissed Stuart, who unsuccessfully challenged Aylmer to a duel. He was hailed as a martyr by those among the British minority in the colony who believed that Aylmer \u201cdare not displease Mr. Citoyen Papineau by whom . . . he is held completely under cow.\u201d Aylmer\u2019s decision had enhanced his reputation with the reformers, however, and particularly with Papineau, who had earlier entertained the Aylmers at his country estate in June 1831. But though \u201con good (I may say cordial) terms\u201d with Papineau, Aylmer was aware that a great gulf existed between them on a number of questions.\n\nFor more than a decade the main preoccupation of the assembly had been to obtain control of the provincial revenues, including those reserved to the crown by the Quebec Revenue Act of 1774 [see Sir Francis Nathaniel Burton*]. Murray\u2019s Whig successor at the Colonial Office, Lord Goderich, instructed Aylmer to submit a pared-down list of estimates to the assembly and to request a permanent civil list preparatory to a surrender of the crown revenues. The assembly paid little attention to Goderich\u2019s estimates and none to his request for a civil list, although it did vote supplies for one year. Ignoring Aylmer\u2019s advice to the contrary and influenced by his parliamentary under-secretary, Lord Howick, Goderich introduced a bill into parliament in the summer of 1831 surrendering the crown revenues unconditionally, and in September he ordered Aylmer to reconvene the legislature and again request a comparatively modest civil list. The assembly, however, refused salaries to several officials on Goderich\u2019s list and, when Aylmer foolishly tried to coerce it by hinting that he would reserve any bill deviating from Goderich\u2019s intentions, it refused permanent salaries to any officials. It seems unlikely that Goderich\u2019s proposals, which were rejected by 42 to 9, would have been accepted by the assembly even had Aylmer been more astute, and the disappointed governor closed the session in late February 1832, acknowledging that his friendly relations with the leaders of the Patriote party had been sorely strained.\n\nIn 1832 deterioration of those relations accelerated after three French-speaking Canadians were shot by British troops on 21 May during a turbulent by-election in Montreal [see Daniel Tracey*]. Aylmer\u2019s sympathies lay with the soldiers, and although he wrote to Papineau regretting the deaths, he refused to intervene in the subsequent judicial process, even when Papineau requested a military inquiry. He encouraged Solicitor General Charles Richard Ogden* to bring the case before a grand jury but later publicly praised the jury\u2019s exoneration of the military. Thereafter Papineau pointedly declined to attend receptions at the Ch\u00e2teau.\n\nThe anger of the Patriote party was fuelled by a cholera epidemic which in 1832 killed more than 7,000 people in the colony. Aylmer had prepared for the outbreak by persuading the legislature to establish a quarantine station at Grosse \u00cele and a board of health at Quebec and to authorize such facilities elsewhere when necessary. Although Aylmer conscientiously enforced the quarantine regulations and issued money to the boards of health and the Montreal Emigrant Society, the measures proved wholly inadequate. Moreover, by insisting that only the law officers of the crown should prosecute he hindered the work of the boards, and by encouraging flight to reduce the incidence of cholera in the cities he contributed to the spread of the disease. Yet, on balance, he did not deserve the censure of the assembly, which also criticized him for issuing funds without its approval and for failing to control the influx of immigrants. In fact, Aylmer did wish to limit immigration and proposed to raise money by a tax on immigrants. When the assembly met in November 1832, it was in an angry mood; it declared Mondelet\u2019s seat vacant on his appointment to the Executive Council, passed a supply bill making no provision for a civil list, which the Legislative Council felt compelled to reject, and adopted an address, similar to one it had itself rejected in the previous session, demanding an elective legislative council.\n\nTo Aylmer these actions demonstrated intransigence, and he requested authorization from London to use the unappropriated funds surrendered to the legislature by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act of 1831. Edward George Geoffrey Smith Stanley, later Lord Stanley, who replaced Goderich at the Colonial Office in April 1833, sympathized but would not act until the assembly had been given an opportunity to reconsider. Consequently, when Aylmer reconvened the legislature in January 1834 he virtually invited a confrontation. He refused to grant the assembly contingency funds of \u00a37,000 and reserved 11 of the 12 bills passed by the legislature, disallowing the 12th. In return the assembly refused to vote supplies and passed 92 resolutions of grievance, including one demanding the governor\u2019s recall. Asserting that the resolutions were tantamount to a \u201cDeclaration of Independence,\u201d Aylmer sent to Stanley a draft bill restoring to the government control over the revenues surrendered to the assembly by Goderich\u2019s Revenue Act. Stanley was prepared to rescind Goderich\u2019s act, and he referred the 92 resolutions to a select committee of the House of Commons, which he assumed would exonerate Aylmer. But Stanley was replaced in June 1834 by Thomas Spring-Rice, an easy-going Irish Whig, who was determined to avoid confrontation. Spring-Rice persuaded the Commons committee to attribute the conflict in Lower Canada simply to \u201cmutual misconceptions.\u201d After meeting with delegates from the assembly, he authorized Aylmer in September to borrow \u00a331,000 from the military chest for unpaid salaries, assuming (erroneously) that the assembly would agree to repay the loan. Aylmer was dismayed by Spring-Rice\u2019s actions and by the failure of the select committee to vindicate his conduct.\n\nIronically, Aylmer had led the Colonial Office to adopt a more conciliatory policy by insisting that the radicals in the assembly were losing support. During the sessions of 1833 and 1834 a rift had developed within the Patriote party, and Aylmer sought to exploit it, in particular by cultivating the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, which opposed the policies of the radicals. Although a devout member of the Church of England, Aylmer was unusually tolerant in his religious views, wishing, for example, to alter the oath taken by justices of the peace so that he could appoint Jewish magistrates [see Aaron Ezekiel Hart*]. He attended mass in the Roman Catholic cathedral as well as in his own, refused to go to the services of a local Anglican priest who had protested Aylmer\u2019s giving pecuniary aid to the Catholic Church, offered the Ursulines of Quebec refuge in the Ch\u00e2teau when a fire broke out in their convent, recommended that the Roman Catholic bishop be appointed to the Executive Council, and discouraged the Colonial Office from interfering with the Sulpician estates. In addition to cultivating the church, Aylmer deliberately chose his nominees for government posts from among the more conservative and \u201crespectable\u201d members of the Patriote party.\n\nAylmer\u2019s appointments, however, had the effect of weakening the moderates in the assembly, since appointees lost their seats. In any case Aylmer was himself an inadequate instrument for multiplying vendus. Progressively disenchanted with what he considered to be the ignorance and ingratitude of French Canadians, he had begun by September 1832 to argue that \u201cBritish influence in Lower Canada . . . must ere long be paramount\u201d and that French Canadians must \u201cfinally reconcile themselves to a fate which cannot be averted.\u201d In October he warned Sir John Colborne*, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, that \u201cwhen the king\u2019s Subjects are spoken of as Foreigners and the Canadians as a Nation held in subjection by another Nation, it becomes the constituted Authorities to be upon their Guard.\u201d By the spring of 1834 he was convinced that so long as the assembly was composed largely of French Canadians \u201cthe Constitution of the Province . . . will never work beneficially.\u201d After the passage of the 92 Resolutions his primary concern was to reconcile the American-born population in the Eastern Townships and the rapidly growing Irish communities in Montreal and Quebec by appointing representatives from both groups to positions of importance. In June 1835 he strongly endorsed the application of \u201can association of gentlemen\u201d from the townships for permission to purchase a large quantity of land on terms similar to those given to the British American Land Company [see Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt*], despite vehement opposition from the assembly.\n\nGradually, in fact, Aylmer had come under the influence of the old official group. In April 1834 he appointed David Chisholme, one of Dalhousie\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, coroner of Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. When John Fletcher was unable to accept a promotion on the bench suggested as recompense for \u201cthe persecution of the House of Assembly to which he has been exposed for a series of years,\u201d Aylmer recommended Samuel Gale*, who had acted as Dalhousie\u2019s agent in England in 1828 and served as counsel to the officers in command during the Montreal \u201cmassacre.\u201d This recommendation encountered strong opposition at the Colonial Office but was accepted under pressure from Aylmer on condition that the next vacancy would be given to a French Canadian.\n\nGale\u2019s appointment alienated many moderates on both sides. Aylmer added to his unpopularity by refusing money to Montreal during a second outbreak of cholera in 1834 and by retreating to the governor\u2019s cottage at William Henry (Sorel) during the height of the outbreak. Late that year the radicals won a sweeping victory at the polls, virtually eliminating the moderates from the assembly. Aylmer was not displeased with this result, arguing that it had \u201croused a feeling (hitherto dormant) in the British Population,\u201d which might, however, \u201clead to very serious results, unless prudently managed.\u201d He enthusiastically approved the formation of militant constitutional associations at Quebec and Montreal, and warned that the British minority were no longer prepared to accept domination by the assembly. He blamed the Patriote victory on \u201cthe Complacency with which the Canada Committee [of 1834] listened to sham Grievances\u201d and predicted that the new assembly would be less reasonable than its predecessor. When the assembly met in February 1835, he made his prediction reality by refusing to issue money for the assembly\u2019s contingencies. In return the house again refused supplies and complained that Aylmer was prejudiced against French Canadians. On 18 March Aylmer prorogued the legislature and called upon Britain to find a solution to the constitutional and financial impasse.\n\nThe solution adopted by the Colonial Office was to replace Aylmer. Spring-Rice had begun to search for a successor in the autumn of 1834 and had promised Aylmer another government if he would resign. But Aylmer wanted exoneration, and he suggested sending a parliamentary commission to examine the assembly\u2019s charges. In April 1835 a three-man commission was appointed, but its head, Lord Gosford [Acheson], would also become Aylmer\u2019s replacement. Aylmer bitterly resented his dismissal and was further antagonized when Gosford, who assumed control of the government on 24 Aug. 1835, dissociated himself from his predecessor. Aylmer\u2019s mood was not improved by a terrifying return voyage, described by Lady Aylmer in Narrative of the passage of the \u201cPique\u201d across the Atlantic (London, 1837). Once in England, he attempted without success to obtain approval of his conduct by refusing appointment as commander of the forces in Ireland unless he got it. However, he did coerce the government into awarding him a gcb, on 10 Sept. 1836, and on 23 Nov. 1841 he became a general, but he never obtained an English peerage, to which he felt entitled, or another administrative post. On 23 Feb. 1850 he died in his London home of an aneurysm of the heart.\n\nOn leaving the colony Aylmer had expressed regret that his \u201canxious endeavours to promote the general welfare of Lower Canada, should have fallen (as they have) so far short\u201d of his initial expectations and burst into tears when the small crowd which had gathered at the wharf cheered. In truth, Aylmer is a tragic figure. He was well meaning and as competent as most of the military men sent to govern British North America following the Napoleonic Wars. But Lower Canada required a governor with political skill, and as Aylmer had noted in October 1831, \u201cI cannot look for advice, or support here, beyond the circle of my own family composed of Soldiers like myself; & on . . . [the other] side of the Water I am totally destitute of Political Connexions.\u201d Largely unprepared, he had found himself \u201ccalled upon all at once to contend against those whose lives have been devoted to the Study of Law & Politics.\u201d The Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser declared that Aylmer had \u201cearned a niche in Canadian History, alongside of the Craigs [Sir James Henry Craig*] and Dalhousies, and gained for himself the execration of half-a-million people\u201d; the Whigs blamed him for the failure of their conciliatory policy; and historians sympathetic to them, such as Helen Taft Manning, have echoed this assessment. Yet, although Aylmer was guilty of serious errors of judgement, much of the criticism of him is unfair. Many of his blunders, as historian Fernand Ouellet notes, \u201cwere more or less provoked,\u201d and he never became as violently francophobic as Craig or Dalhousie, never lost his temper in public, never closed the doors of the Ch\u00e2teau to his opponents. He contributed to ethnic polarization in Lower Canada, but he was not responsible for it, nor could he, any more than Gosford, a civilian with considerable political experience, have prevented its development. Moreover, Aylmer was handicapped by the rapid changes of government in Britain during the early 1830s, serving under five secretaries whose views on Lower Canada differed sharply. Without \u201cPolitical Connexions\u201d in Britain, he was sacrificed to facilitate accommodation with the Lower Canadian assembly; the sacrifice, ironically, was in vain for by then the train of events leading to the rebellions of 1837\u201338 was probably irreversible.\n\nPhillip Buckner"}, {"url": "http://www.culturegrid.org.uk/search/5415346.html", "page_content": "Date: Description: A three-quarter length portrait to the left, showing Aylmer in armour, wearing a red sash and brown full-bottomed wig.

He served in the galley ?Charles? in the Mediterranean, becoming lieutenant in her in April the following year. He was further advanced by his patron, Admiral Arthur Herbert, to captain of the ?Chatham? and other commands followed. The Glorious Revolution of 1688?89 proved favourable to Aylmer?s career. He was appointed to the ?Mary? on 22 December 1688 and saw action in her at the Battle of Bantry Bay on 1 May 1689, where the ship sustained significant damage. He commanded the ?Royal Katherine? at the Battle of Beachy Head in 160 and the ?London? at the Battle of Barfleur in 1692. He was promoted rear-admiral on 8 February 1693 and vice-admiral that June. Political machinations at the Admiralty saw him withdraw from active service in November 1699, but he was recalled as commander-in-chief between November 1709 and January 1711 and again between 1714 and 1718. He was appointed governor of Greenwich Hospital on 6 November 1714. He died in post at the Queen?s House on 18 August 1720; he is buried in St Alfege?s Church.

As Catholics they suffered during the Civil Wars, when Aylmer\u2019s grandfather was imprisoned, but were restored at least to some of their lands in 1661. Aylmer\u2019s father, who received a baronetcy at this time, showed a loyalty to King Charles II which extended to a willingness to compromise with the Protestant establishment: he subscribed to the \u2018protestation and remonstrance\u2019 of Catholic gentry in 1661 repudiating papal authority, and both his younger sons, Matthew and George, conformed to the Established Church. As a result, Christopher came into conflict both with his own father, and then with his eldest son, Gerald, who disputed title to the family inheritance before eventually succeeding as 2nd Bt. Gerald then jeopardized the family estates by joining James II in 1689. In October 1690 Matthew Aylmer petitioned for a grant of the property his brother had forfeited, but the outcome is not known.\n\nAs the second son, Matthew embarked on a military career, as did his younger brother, George (d. 1689). He seems to have become a client of the 2nd Duke of Buckingham, in whose regiment he was commissioned. After the disbandment of the regiment, family history notes that Aylmer raised troops in Munster for the Dutch, before obtaining a commission in a Tangier regiment in 1677, and then switching to a naval career. While on active service at Tangier, he was raised to captain by Admiral Arthur Herbert\u2020, and continued to serve until the evacuation of the garrison in 1683\u20134. In James II\u2019s reign Aylmer saw service at sea against Monmouth\u2019s rebels, before receiving promotion in the army. Given his Catholic antecedents, and his elder brother\u2019s commitment to Rome, Aylmer\u2019s position was fraught with possibilities and dangers; in July 1687 he received a dispensation from taking the oaths of allegiance and supremacy while acting as an army captain. However, in 1688 he showed unequivocal support for the Prince of Orange, and was a leading participant in the \u2018navy plot\u2019 against James II.\n\nAylmer\u2019s main patron at this time appears to have been Edward Russell*. In February 1690, a report that John Hill had been appointed to the Navy Board brought a missive from Russell to Secretary Nottingham (Daniel Finch\u2020), extolling Aylmer\u2019s qualifications for such a post and recalling previous service to the Williamite cause. He was considered for a flag as early as August 1690, but it was as a captain that he was given command of the Mediterranean fleet in 1690\u20131, although he was allowed to retain his lieutenant-colonelcy in the army. In August 1691 Aylmer sought command of the West Indies squadron, but had to wait until 1693 for a flag. He may have tried to take advantage of the Smyrna fleet debacle in 1693, because Sir Ralph Delaval* wrote acidly, \u2018there was not a flag at the council of war so very fond of coming into port as Mr Aylmer who I suppose doth all the good is in his nature but his hand is to every resolution of our councils of war which I hope to see him deny\u2019. The following year saw his appointment to the Navy Board.\n\nAylmer\u2019s first foray into electoral politics ended in a double return at the Portsmouth by-election of 1695 (after Russell himself had created the vacancy by opting to sit for Cambridgeshire). The Commons on 24 Jan. 1696 voted this a void election, and even with Russell\u2019s backing Aylmer\u2019s interest proved insufficient to overcome that of John Gibson, the town\u2019s lieutenant-governor, who was returned unopposed at the second by-election. Early in 1696, the deposition of the Assassination Plotter Peter Cook suggested that the Jacobites thought they could \u2018depend\u2019 upon Aylmer, but nothing incriminating was revealed. In May 1697 he subscribed \u00a31,000 to the contract for lending money to circulate Exchequer bills. The death of James Chadwick* left a vacancy for Dover, a borough in which the navy could exercise considerable influence. Aylmer approached the corporation in June 1697 and, despite snide references by Philip Papillon* to Aylmer\u2019s Irishness and lack of any visible estate in the town or county, he was returned on 15 Dec., taking his seat on the 20th.\n\nIn February 1698 Aylmer was given command of the squadron destined for the Mediterranean. At this point he was \u2018in town\u2019, and presumably attending Parliament. Delays in supplying the fleet, owing to a shortage of funds, meant that he did not sail until September, which may have allowed him to consolidate his position in Dover with timely applications to the government for money to repair Dover harbour. Before leaving England he was re-elected, and was listed as a placeman in September 1698 and as a placeman on a comparative analysis of the old and new Parliaments. In an addendum to this list he was marked as absent, and the House officially excused his attendance on 7 Mar. 1699 because of his duties at sea and as envoy to various North African states.\n\nDuring Aylmer\u2019s absence (he returned at the end of October 1699) there was a lengthy parliamentary inquiry into mismanagements at the Admiralty, one of the allegations being the delay in fitting out Aylmer\u2019s squadron. Other, more specific, charges against him included his detention of the Centurion at Cadiz in order to force its commander, Price, to concede a large share of his profits, and Aylmer\u2019s role as victualler of his own fleet while in the Mediterranean. Opinion divided on party lines as to his culpability. Sir Richard Cocks, 2nd Bt.*, thought Price\u2019s charges \u2018mere malice, nothing in it at all\u2019, while James Vernon I* reported that the House had considered, in regard to victualling, that Aylmer was \u2018too honest and too considerate\u2019 to have submitted false accounts and profit thereby. However, Robert Harley\u2019s* papers contain the draft of a resolution condemning Aylmer for corruption and breach of trust in detaining Price at Cadiz. This may well relate to the debate in the committee of the whole on 10 Mar. 1699, when Aylmer was blamed, but the matter was \u2018let fall before they came to any question\u2019.\n\nWhile Aylmer was at sea during the summer of 1699 Orford resigned his place at the Admiralty. In discussions that followed there was talk of promoting George Churchill* to a flag senior to Aylmer, no doubt as part of the Earl of Marlborough\u2019s (John Churchill\u2020) rapprochement with the Court. Vernon felt that Aylmer might resign over this matter, possibly \u2018to give a handle for finding fault with the partialities of this commission of Admiralty, and to show the case is not much mended in that respect\u2019, and that the appointment of Churchill would be difficult to defend on the grounds of experience and seniority. In the event, Churchill went to the Admiralty in place of Sir Robert Rich, 2nd Bt.*, while Aylmer continued at the Navy Board. An analysis of the House into \u2018interests\u2019 in early 1700 listed Aylmer as a member of the Bedford/Orford connexion. This affiliation did not help him to obtain one of the limited number of peacetime commands, although his name was linked with a squadron going to the Straits. In March 1701 he was listed among those flag officers \u2018unemployed at sea\u2019. Aylmer\u2019s attention to constituency matters, such as his appointment on 12 Feb. 1700 to draft a bill to repair Dover harbour, ensured that he was returned at the election of January 1701; he even appears to have retained the naval interest at Dover although another Court supporter, Secretary of State Sir Charles Hedges*, was also returned. In the ensuing parliamentary session, Aylmer was listed among those thought likely to support the Court in February over the \u2018Great Mortgage\u2019.\n\nWhen Dover corporation rebuffed Hedges in the run-up to the election of December 1701, it was mostly because of Aylmer\u2019s \u2018neglect\u2019 of their interests. In comparison, he had been more attentive, particularly over the harbour. Aylmer was also solicitous for his own interests: hence a petition he signed with three other navy commissioners on 31 Dec. 1701, for the continuance of an allowance of \u00a380 p.a. for housing, in view of the fact that they could not be accommodated in government property. Aylmer had resided in the parish of St. Paul\u2019s, Covent Garden, since at least as early as 1694, moving from St. Martin\u2019s-in-the-Fields at some point after 1690, possibly coincidental with his appointment to the Navy Board in 1692. He had also purchased an estate near Dover, presumably by 1701 when he presented to an advowson at nearby East Langdon. On a list of the new Parliament, Harley classed him as a Whig. With fewer naval duties to perform, Aylmer was more active in the 1701\u20132 session, and was included on the drafting committee of a bill to encourage privateers. On a personal note he also assisted in the management of a private bill for the Fitzgerald and Plunkett families, with both of whom the Irish Aylmers were connected.\n\nAylmer had been appointed vice-admiral of the red in January 1702, but the death of William III saw his naval career at a standstill, following the Queen\u2019s decision to employ George Churchill in that place, and the consequent dispute about seniority which Vernon had predicted three years before. Aylmer was also left out of a revamped Navy Board, for which the governorship of Deal and nomination to the Kentish lieutenancy and the bench were poor recompense. Re-elected for Dover in 1702, in July he petitioned the Queen for a pension, such as had been given by William III to Admirals Delaval and Killigrew (Henry*). Aylmer considered his position to be similar, in that he had been displaced from being vice-admiral of the red by Churchill and then removed from the Navy Board, whereas the official view was that Aylmer had declined to serve and had as a consequence also lost his post as a navy commissioner. Although L\u2019Hermitage had described him in February 1702 as a Whig and a creature of Orford, Aylmer was spotted caballing in September with Lord Burlington (Hon. Charles Boyle I*), Lord Somers (Sir John*), Lord Halifax (Charles Montagu*), (Sir) Thomas Felton* (4th Bt.) and \u2018Mr Hopkins [?Thomas*]\u2019. Nothing came of these discussions between overlooked politicians, but Aylmer remained a Whig, voting on 13 Feb. 1703 to agree with the Lords\u2019 amendments enlarging the time for taking the oaths of abjuration. Forecast as an opponent of the Tack, he did not vote for it on 28 Nov. 1704.\n\nIn January 1705 there was a rumour that Aylmer would serve at sea again the following summer, and in a conciliatory move the Treasury ordered a stay of prosecution against Aylmer and Sir Basill Dixwell, 2nd Bt.*, for failure to account for money given to them to repair Dover harbour. Returned again at the 1705 election, Aylmer was described in an analysis of the new House as a \u2018High Church Courtier\u2019, and his name appears on a list of placemen for 1705, presumably because of his governorship at Deal. On 25 Oct. 1705 he voted for the Court candidate as Speaker, and later in the session, on 18 Feb. 1706, supported the Court in the proceedings on the \u2018place clause\u2019 of the regency bill. He was more active in the Commons in this Parliament, his committee appointments again reflecting his interest in naval affairs, and in 1706 he presented a memorial to the Treasury on the desirability of the Navy Board taking over responsibility for Dover harbour.\n\nRe-elected in 1708, Aylmer was classed as a Whig on two lists of that year. He sought to capitalize on the swing towards the Whigs at this time and gain further preferment. Thus on 25 May, only a few weeks after the general election, he wrote to Marlborough to remind the Duke of a memorial delivered the previous winter, in which Aylmer had asked for the governorship of Greenwich Hospital, \u2018or to be allowed a subsistence\u2019. Since that post had been disposed of, Aylmer recounted the \u2018hardships under which I suffer, and not being conscious that I have done anything can deserve so particular a mark of severeness above all other officers\u2019. Marlborough seems to have responded favourably to this letter, which was referred to Lord Treasurer Godolphin (Sidney\u2020), although nothing was done immediately. In December 1708 a commission was made out for Aylmer as admiral of the fleet, which was superseded the following day. This was a device to provide Aylmer with a \u2018subsistence\u2019 on half pay at a high rank. In 1709 he supported the naturalization of the Palatines. With the Earl of Pembroke (Hon. Thomas Herbert\u2020) as Lord High Admiral, rumours began to circulate as early as March that the Admiralty would be put into a commission which would include Aylmer. The same rumours recurred in October and November, but when Orford was brought back into the Admiralty Aylmer was not one of the commissioners; instead he was given command of the fleet. This did not please everyone: Sir John Jennings* felt rather as Aylmer had done in 1702 when Churchill had been appointed, and Arthur Maynwaring* noted that \u2018the officers have no real value for Mr Aylmer, nor indeed for anyone now but for Jennings\u2019. As a consequence of his appointment Aylmer had to fight a by-election, but was returned unopposed. In the 1709\u201310 session he voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell.\n\nReturned again at the 1710 election, Aylmer soon lost his position as admiral and commander-in-chief of the fleet. Indeed, at the committee of elections on 22 Feb. 1711, both Aylmer and Jennings were \u2018severely criticized\u2019 for interfering at the election for Weymouth by treating the corporation on board ship. However, when the report came before the House on 17 Mar. no resolution critical of Aylmer was passed. The end of the session saw Aylmer appealing to Harley for repayment of the contingency money he had spent while equipping himself for service at sea the previous year and referring again to the hardships he had undergone. In the following session Aylmer voted on 7 Dec. 1711 for the \u2018No Peace without Spain\u2019 motion, but otherwise was not very active. In the 1713 session he was not present in the Commons to vote in the divisions of 18 June over the French commerce bill because he had gone to Deal Castle with Sir John Norris* (his son-in-law) to celebrate the marriage of his younger daughter to Hugh Fortescue*.\n\nNot only was Aylmer defeated at the 1713 general election, it was even felt necessary to scotch a rumour in the following January that he was a Catholic. However, he was soon back in favour after the Hanoverian succession. In October 1714 he was reported to have been made governor of Greenwich Hospital, a post he had long coveted, which \u2018is a very pretty post, and has a very pleasant house to dwell in\u2019. November saw him reappointed admiral of the fleet, and he regained his seat in the Commons at the 1715 general election. On a comparative analysis of the 1713 and 1715 Parliaments he was listed as a Whig. Aylmer continued as admiral until he exchanged the post for the honorific title of rear-admiral of England and an Irish peerage in 1718. He died at Greenwich on 18 Aug. 1720, although his will, dated in June that year, still gave his address as Covent Garden. In it he had appointed as executor his son Henry\u2020, an equerry to the King. Swift wrote off his compatriot as a violent partisan, but Aylmer seems to have been skilled at exploiting the situations available to him. His early naval career was marked by the smooth facility with which he moved between patrons, yet he managed to retain his seat at Dover even after the original backing of the Navy interest had been lost.\n\nRef Volumes: 1690-1715\n\nAuthor: Stuart Handley\n\nNotes"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Matthew_Whitworth-Aylmer,_5th_Baron_Aylmer", "page_content": "What we do.

Early in the following year he was advanced to the rank of captain; and he appears to have served almost constantly, during the next ten years, on the coast of Algiers and in the Mediterranean. In October 1688 he was appointed captain of the Swallow in the Thames, but at once gave in his allegiance to the cause of the Revolution. In 1690 he commanded the Royal Katherine, and, in the battle off Beachy Head, was one of the seconds to Sir Ralph Delavall who commanded the blue squadron; and in 1692, still in the Royal Katherine, was one of the seconds of the commander-in-chief at Barfleur. In February 1693 he was advanced to the rank of rear-admiral, and to that of vice-admiral in the following year, when he accompanied Admiral Russell to the Mediterranean. After the peace of Ryswick he was sent, in 1698, as commander-in-chief, again into the Mediterranean, principally to confirm the treaties with the regencies of Tripoli, Tunis, and Algiers; which he happily accomplished, and returned home towards the end of the next year. In November 1699, being, it is said, dissatisfied at the appointment of Admiral Churchill to the admiralty, he retired from active service, though he continued to act as one of the commissioners of the navy till July 1702. He took no part whatever in naval affairs beyond sitting in parliament as baron or member for Dover, till after the death of Prince George, and the retirement of Churchill in November 1709, when he was appointed commander-in-chief of the fleet. In the following July, whilst cruising in the Soundings, he fell in with a French squadron and convoy, of which only one merchantman and the Superbe, of 56 guns, were captured; the rest escaped, owing, it was alleged, to the \u200bhaziness of the weather. The want of success served the new ministry as an excuse to supersede him, which they did in January 1711. He held no further command till the accession of George I, when he was again appointed commander-in-chief, ranger of Greenwich Park, and governor of Greenwich Hospital. This office he held till his death; and during that time succeeded in establishing the hospital school for the sons of seamen, which, from small beginnings, has been gradually developed into the magnificent institution of the present day. In April 1717 he became one of the lords commissioners of the admiralty, but he resigned the appointment early the next year, when he was advanced to be rear-admiral of the United Kingdom, and at the same time raised to the peerage as Lord Aylmer of Balrath.

He was born in London, the son of a barrister, and was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar in 1845, and became a Queen's Counsel in 1859. He was appointed a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in 1867, and was knighted in 1871. Reynolds was a prolific author, writing on a wide range of topics. He wrote several books on legal topics, including The Law of Libel and Slander (1863), The Law of Copyright (1865), and The Law of Patents for Inventions (1868). He also wrote on a variety of other topics, including history, biography, and literature. He was a frequent contributor to the Saturday Review, and wrote several books on Shakespeare, including The Mystery of William Shakespeare (1848) and The Authorship of Shakespeare (1875). He also wrote a biography of the poet John Keats (1848).\" \"Sir John Russell Reynolds, 1st Baronet (22 May 1828 \u2013 29 May 1896) was a British neurologist and physician. Reynolds was born in Romsey, Hampshire, as the son of John Reynolds, an independent minister, and the grandson of Dr. Henry Revell Reynolds. He received general education from his father, and was educated in his profession at University College, London, where he obtained three gold medals in the medical school. In 1851, he graduated M.B. in the University of London, and obtained a scholarship and gold medal in medicine. In 1852, he took the degree of M.D., and began practice in Leeds. He soon after moved to London, and took a house, 38 Grosvenor Street, in which Dr. Marshall Hall had lived. Hall announced to his patients in a printed circular that Reynolds had succeeded him in practice. Such procedure was contrary to a recognised understanding among physicians, and Hall incurred the censure of the College of Physicians. Reynolds, who was ignorant of Hall's intention, was in no way responsible for the circular, and was in no way involved in the censure. He was duly elected a Fellow of the College in 1859. In the same year, he was appointed Assistant Physician to University College Hospital, to which he continued attached throughout life. He had before been, in 1855, Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Sick Children, and in 1857 Assistant Physician to the Westminster Hospital. In 1865, he became Professor of the Principles and Practice of Medicine at University College, and in 1878 he was appointed Physician-in-Ordinary to the Queen's Household. He gained a considerable practice as a physician, and was often consulted in difficult cases of nervous disease. In 1869, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1883 Vice-President of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society. He delivered the Lumleian Lecture at the College of Physicians in 1867, the Harveian Oration in 1884, and was elected President in 1893, on the death of Sir Andrew Clark. He was re-elected in 1894 and 1895, and on 1 January in the latter year was created a Baronet. In the winter of 1895\u201396, he became too ill to offer himself for re-election as President of the College of Physicians. He died at his house in Grosvenor Street, London, after several weeks of illness of a pulmonary congestion, on 29 May 1896. He was married, first, to Miss Ainslie, and, secondly, to Frances, widow of C. J. C. Crespigny, but left no children. The \"Reynolds Baronetcy\", of Grosvenor Street, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 28 February 1895 for John Russell Reynolds. The title became extinct on his death. Reynolds devoted himself from an early period to the study of nervous diseases, and in 1854 published an \"Essay on Vertigo\"; in 1855 \"Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain, Spinal Cord, and Nerves\", as well as \"Tables for the Diagnosis of Diseases of the Brain\"; in 1861 a treatise on epilepsy; in 1871 \"Lectures on the Clinical Uses of Electricity\"; in 1872 \"The Scientific Value of the Legal Tests of Insanity\"; besides many papers in medical periodicals and the transactions of medical societies, and several addresses to medical associations. His writings on nervous diseases were useful contributions to a department of medicine in which much work remained undone, but in the flood of modern observations they have been submerged. He will chiefly be remembered among physicians as the editor of the \"System of Medicine\", in five volumes, published from 1866 to 1879, a collection of essays on diseases, written by the most competent men who could be induced to write \u2013 compositions of varying merit, but generally of high value. He himself wrote the parts on erysipelas, on inflammation of the lymphatics, and on several forms of nervous disease. He published in 1893 a \"Life of Dr. Walter Hayle Walshe\". Reynolds was a tall man, with dark hair, with a dignified delivery and some oratorical power.
