She became engaged to Maurice No\u00ebl, a soldier who died in the Congo from tropical disease in 1904 before the marriage could take place. B\u00e9raud lived with General Elie No\u00ebl and his wife at Villa Carmen in Algiers. She claimed she developed her psychic ability after the death of her fianc\u00e9.\n\nIn 1905, she held a series of s\u00e9ances at Villa Carmen and sitters were invited. In these s\u00e9ances she claimed to materialize a spirit called Bien Boa, a 300-year-old Brahmin Hindu. However, photographs taken of Boa looked like the figure was made from a large cardboard cutout. In other sittings Charles Richet reported that Boa was breathing, had moved around the room and had touched him. A photograph revealed Boa to be a man dressed up in a cloak, helmet and beard.\n\nA newspaper article in 1906 revealed that an Arab coachman known as Areski, who had previously worked at the villa, had been hired to play the part of Bien Boa and that the entire thing was a hoax. Areski wrote that he made his appearance into the room by a trapdoor. B\u00e9raud also admitted to being involved with the hoax.\n\nIn 1909, B\u00e9raud changed her name to Eva Carri\u00e8re (Eva C) to hide the fraud of her past and began a new career as a psychic. B\u00e9raud had a sexual relationship with a woman 25 years her elder, Juliette Bisson (1861\u20131956), with whom she performed during her seances.\n\nBeraud died in 1943.\n\nInvestigations\n\nCarri\u00e8re's psychic performances were investigated by Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes mystery series. He believed that her performances were genuine and that she was not engaged in any deception. Another famous psychic investigator of the time, Harry Houdini, observed one of her s\u00e9ances and *erted that they were fraudulent. Houdini was never convinced by Carri\u00e8re and likened her performance to a magician's trick, the Hindu needle trick.\n\nThe physician-psychical researcher Gustav Geley investigated Carri\u00e8re and wrote she was a genuine psychic but never-published photographs were discovered after Geley's death which revealed fraudulent activity from the psychic's companion, Juliette Bisson, such as wires seen running from Carri\u00e8re's head supporting fake ectoplasm. Another physician-psychical researcher, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing, investigated Carri\u00e8re and believed the ectoplasm she produced was genuine. The psychiatrist Mathilde Ludendorff wrote that the experiments of Schrenck-Notzing were unscientific and that he had been duped by tricks of Carri\u00e8re. In the Schrenck-Notzing psychic sessions with Carri\u00e8re the scientific controls were scarce and there was evidence that she had freed her hands in the s\u00e9ance room.\n\nCarri\u00e8re has been described as \"perverse and neurotic\". She was well known for running around the s\u00e9ance room naked indulging in sexual activities with her audience. Her companion Juliette Bisson would, during the course of the s\u00e9ance sittings with Schrenck-Notzing, introduce her finger into Eva's * to ensure no \"ectoplasm\" had been loaded there beforehand to fool the investigators, and she would also strip nude at the end of a s\u00e9ance and demanded another full-on gynecological exam. The psychic sessions of Carri\u00e8re with Schrenck-Notzing have been described as adult movieographic. The photographs that were taken during the s\u00e9ances show Carri\u00e8re in the nude emerging from her cabinet and others revealing fake ectoplasm strings hanging from her breasts. Another photograph revealed ectoplasm in the shape of a deflated and disembodied *. According to historian Ruth Brandon, Juliette Bisson and Carri\u00e8re were in a sexual relationship together, and they worked in collaboration with each other to fake the ectoplasm and eroticize their male audience.\n\nIn 1920, anthropologist Eric Dingwall and physician-psychical researcher V. J. Woolley tested Carri\u00e8re in London. They found no evidence of psychic phenomena, discovered that her ectoplasm was made from chewed paper, and said \"the s\u00e9ances proved negative\". Ruth Brandon wrote that Carri\u00e8re produced some of her effects by regurgitation, hiding her ectoplasm in the s\u00e9ance cabinet and using her secret accomplice Juliette Bisson.\n\nAccording to Harry Price, the photographs of her ectoplasm taken with Schrenck-Notzing looked artificial and two-dimensional, made from cardboard and newspaper portraits, and that there were no scientific controls, as both her hands were free. In 1920, Carri\u00e8re was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) in London. She was also investigated in 1922 and the result of the tests were negative.\n\nIn 1954, Donald West wrote that Carri\u00e8re's ectoplasm was made of cut-out paper faces from magazines and newspapers, on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carri\u00e8re taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it was made from a magazine cut out, complete with the letters \"Le Miro\". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir. Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carri\u00e8re's ectoplasm faces. In 1913, a Miss Barkley in an article in the newspaper Neue Wiener Tagblatt exposed the fraud of Carri\u00e8re:\n\nMiss Eva prepared the heads before every s\u00e9ance, and endeavoured to make them unrecognizable. A clean-shaven face was decorated with a beard. Grey hairs became black curls, a broad forehead was made into a narrow one. In spite of all her endeavours, she could not obliterate certain characteristic lines.\n\nCarri\u00e8re used cut out faces of Woodrow Wilson, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, French president Raymond Poincar\u00e9, and the actress Mona Delza.\n\nAlso in 1954, Rudolf Lambert, an SPR member, published details of fraud which had been covered up by many early members of the Ins*ute Metapsychique International (IMI). Lambert had studied Gustav Geley's files on Eva Carri\u00e8re, and discovered photographs taken by her companion Juliette Bisson depicting fraudulent ectoplasm. Various \"materializations\" were artificially attached to Eva's hair by wires. Geley never published his discovery. Eug\u00e9ne Osty, the director of the Ins*ute, and members Jean Meyer, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing and Charles Richet all knew about the fraudulent photographs, but were firm believers in spirituality phenomena, so demanded the scandal be kept secret.\n\nGallery\n\nThe spirit Bien Boa, which was discovered to be a dressed-up man\n\nCarri\u00e8re with fake ectoplasm made from the French magazine Le Miroir\n\nCarri\u00e8re during a s\u00e9ance\n\nCarri\u00e8re with fake ectoplasm\n\nSee also\n\nSpirituality\n\nSpiritualism\n\nPsychokinesis\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nRuth Brandon.

It was established in 1648 as the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture (Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture) to provide free instruction and promote equality among its students, making it possible for students from all social backgrounds to attend. Instruction was offered in painting, sculpture, and engraving; after the school merged with the Acad\u00e9mie Royale d\u2019Architecture (Royal Academy of Architecture) in 1793, architecture was added to the curriculum, though instruction in this discipline ceased in 1968. Most great French artists of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries were trained at the school, including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley.\n\nPrior to the establishment of the school, fine arts instruction was given privately by master artists to their apprentices. This method of instruction had grouped students pursuing knowledge of the fine arts with pupils working with artisans and other craftsmen; furthermore, the system favored instruction of the wealthy and privileged.\n\nIn 1648 a small group of young artists broke away from this system to establish in Paris the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, the first French institution dedicated solely to the study of fine arts, modeling the school after similar institutions in Italy. The first class at the school was given in public on Feb. 1, 1648, by a 29-year-old teacher named Charles Le Brun, who taught the class in front of a large assembly of students, artists, and art enthusiasts. Such a public method of fine arts instruction was then unknown.\n\nThe curriculum of the school stressed modern thinking\u2014the fundamental values were simplicity, grandeur, clean lines, and harmony of color and style. Students were urged to study art from ancient Greece and Rome. To encourage students to study classical art, in 1663 the school established the Prix de Rome, an annual competition whose first prize was the chance to study in Italy.\n\nAfter 168 years of instruction, the school was moved in 1816 to its current location in a group of historic buildings in the Latin Quarter, the university district of Paris. In 1863 the school was renamed the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts.\n\nDuring the 19th century, the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts was the most important center of architectural education in the Western world. It drew students not only from France but also from throughout Europe as well as from North America. At the school, architecture was seen as a public service involving the representation in stone of national and civic dignity, and teaching thus centered on the problems of designing monumental public buildings in the classical style.\n\nIn May 1968, frustrated by racism, sexism, and an outdated curriculum, students at the school joined a general uprising of university students throughout Paris. Barricades were set up and the revolt continued for several weeks. The revolt brought profound changes to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, among which was the termination of the 320-year-old tradition of the Prix de Rome contests. The same year, architectural instruction was removed from the school, narrowing the course offerings to only the visual arts."}, {"url": "http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/education/ecole-des-beaux-arts-paris.htm", "page_content": "Origins & History\n\nThe Ecole des Beaux Arts was established in 1648 - as part of the French Academy of Fine Arts - by the powerful Cardinal Mazarin in order to train exceptional students in life drawing, painting, sculpture, engraving and architecture.\n\nFine art instruction had long been a tradition in Europe, ever since the Middle Ages when Master painters passed their artistic knowledge onto apprentices. The Ecole des Beaux Arts was considered revolutionary in its time for imitating the courses and training offered by the great Italian academies like the Florentine Academy of the Art of Design (Accademia dell'Arte del Disegno, later renamed Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze) and the Academy of St Luke in Rome (Accademia di San Luca). The first class was given in public on the 1st of February 1648 by painter Charles Le Brun (1619-1690). The original timetable ran from April to October, when daylight hours were best. In 1663 the school inaugurated the prestigious Prix de Rome, a scholarship award for students of painting, sculpture and architecture. Designed to create a taste for classical art in students, its trials lasted 3 months and were highly competitive. Famous winners of the prize included the rococo painter Francois Boucher (1720), the neoclassical artist Jacques-Louis David (1774) and the traditionalist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres (1801). Painters who tried but failed to win the Prix de Rome include Impressionists Edouard Manet (1832\u009683) and Edgar Degas (1834\u00961917). Another who tried and failed was Jean-Leon Gerome (1824-1904) - famous for his orientalist painting and populist historical works - who eventually secured a coveted professorship at the Ecole des Beaux Arts.\n\nWorld famous graduates of the school's Architecture department include the Americans Richard Morris Hunt (1827-95) and Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-86).\n\nConservative Teaching Methods"}, {"url": "https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/e/ecole-des-beaux-arts", "page_content": "The original \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts emerged from the teaching function of the French Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, established in Paris in 1648. In 1816 the Acad\u00e9mie Royale school moved to a separate building and in 1863 was renamed the Ecole des Beaux Arts.\n\nThe basis of the teaching was the art of ancient Greece and Rome, that is, classical art. But anatomy, geometry, perspective and study from the nude were also part of the curriculum. In 1663 the Acad\u00e9mie founded the Prix de Rome, a hugely prestigious prize that gave winners a prolonged visit to Rome to study classical art on the spot. In 1666 the Acad\u00e9mie also founded a branch in Rome to provide teaching and a base for these students. Subsequently most major French cities established their own \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. The Prix de Rome was abolished in 1968 as a result of the student revolt of that year.\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts had become deeply conservative. This led to independent rival schools springing up in Paris, such as the Acad\u00e9mie Julian and the Acad\u00e9mie Colarossi. The \u00c9cole remained the basic model for an art school until the foundation of the Bauhaus in 1919. Most of the illustrious names in French art passed through the \u00c9cole up to and including some of the young impressionists."}]}
