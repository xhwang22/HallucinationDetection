Death notices\u2014which are paid announcements\u2014appear more frequently. These vary in length, but many only give the name of the decedent and the name of a mortuary.\n\nThere is no comprehensive index to obituaries and death notices for the newspapers in Los Angeles. This means you have to either look through the newspapers page by page near the date of death (usually on microfilm), or search using keywords in a digitized format of the newspaper.\n\nThe Southern California Genealogical Society has an online index to obituaries found in the Los Angeles Times, but it is not complete.\n\nWe have a subscription to the digitized Los Angeles Times Historical Database (1881-1994). We also provide access to the digitized newspaper databases Access Newspaper Archives and the Los Angeles Sentinel Historical Archive (1934-2005). You may access all three of these databases from home with your library card on our Research & Homework page.\n\nYou will need a valid library card to access our subscription to the Los Angeles Times at no cost. Access is also available online at latimes.newspapers.com. Searching for abstracts/citations is free, but to obtain the full-text articles you must pay a fee. Or give us the precise citation information you find, and we can scan and email the article to you for $5 per request and 25-cents-a-page.\n\nIf you don\u2019t find the obituary in the above-mentioned databases, you could come to Central Library to pore over our other microfilmed newspapers. This guide (PDF) can help you find out what newspapers were published in Los Angeles for each decade. These newspapers are also not indexed, so it will help you immensely if you know the place and date of death. This information can be obtained from a death index or death certificate.\n\nTwo state-level California Death Indexes can be found at Ancestry.com (a database anyone can access from any library branch and Central Library) or FamilySearch.org (a free internet database).\n\nCalifornia, Death Index, 1905-1939 provides the digitized index page, plus its transcription. On the digitized page, you can often find the name of the decedent, initials of his/her spouse, age at death, a number representing county or city of death (\u201c19\u201d for Los Angeles county; \u201c70\u201d for Los Angeles city), date of death and STATE-level index number.\n\nCalifornia, Death Index, 1940-1997 only provides a transcription of the index page. From this transcription, you can often find name, Social Security number, gender, birth date and place, death date and place, mother\u2019s maiden name, and you can order a copy of the death certificate online. This index only provides the county of death, unless the death occurred in the cities of Alameda, Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco.\n\nSome indexing for deaths prior to 1905 can be found at the Pre-1905 CA Death Index Project.\n\nTo obtain an actual death certificate (and not just the index) for persons dying in Los Angeles County after July 1, 1905, contact the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, 12400 E. Imperial Hwy, Norwalk, CA 90650.\n\nFor persons dying between 1940-1997, you can order a copy of the death certificate via Ancestry.com for a fee. Just go to the Ancestry.com database California, Death Index, 1940-1997 and find your person by using keywords (name).

You will be able to find your person by the INDEX NUMBER.\n\nThe index number you find in the state-level California Death Index will not correspond with these death certificates because they are county-level; you need to use the index number found in this data set.\n\nObituaries, as opposed to death notices, are found more frequently in the suburban community newspapers. There are 88 cities in Los Angeles County. Many of these communities have their own newspapers, and backfiles of those papers can often be found at the public libraries in those communities (go to google.com and type [city name] public library). The database Access Newspaper Archives contains many of these smaller papers in digital format. For instance, many of the newspapers from Van Nuys are here from 1900-1977.\n\nObituaries for Los Angeles residents who were born and raised in other parts of the United States, particularly in small and medium sized communities, are often found in their hometown newspapers. Use this newspaper directory from the Library of Congress to find lists of newspapers published in certain locations during certain times.\n\nThe Glendale Public Library does local obituary searches for a fee.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Library does three free obituary searches per month per patron. The person whose obituary is sought needs to have died within Los Angeles County. Please have as much information about the death as possible (date, place, name, etc.) and call your local County library or contact them via their website.\n\nThe Los Angeles Public Library is unable to do obituary searches for you. However, the library can provide a Directory of Genealogists who are willing to do research for a fee.

The California Department of Public health maintains California Death Records of 1905-present. If you make a request for post 1970 death records, your request will take about three weeks to process. On the other hand, if you make a request for pre-1970 records, your request will take about seven weeks to provide. Whether you want pre-1970 or post-1970 California death records, you will receive the records only if you\u2019re eligible for them. You can however lookup California death records online for reference only.\n\nPeople who can request for certified death records in California include the immediate family members of the deceased and people with a financial interest in the record. There are two types of death records that you can request for in California: certified records and uncertified records. The fee for the certified death record is different from the fee for the uncertified death record. There are multiple ways for you to request for and obtain death records in California: in person, by mail and online. Following is how you can obtain the death record you need through each way.\n\nWhere Do I Get a Death Certificate in California?\n\nThe fastest way to make a request for and obtain the California death record you need is in online or in person. To make an in person request for the record, go to the local California Department of Public health office, submit a completed Application for Certified Copy of Death Record, and pay the required fee. Also, you may need to provide a sworn statement. Generally, a sworn statement is required when you\u2019re ordering copy of the California death record. The fee for California death records is nominal and a copy can be mailed to you within a few weeks of ordering it from the Department of Public Health\n\nHow To Order a California Death Certificate By Mail\n\nAnother way for you to make and request for and obtain the California death certificate record you need is by mail. To make a mail request for the record you need, you must go online to the California DPH website and download the request for a certificate, print up and fill out the document and sign and show proof of relationship and your identity and pay the nominal fee.

You should get updates on when the certificate is processed and being sent out in the mail.\n\nCalifornia Department of Public Health\n\nVital Records \u2013 MS 5103\n\nP.O. Box 997410\n\nSacramento, CA 95899-7410\n\nAre California Death Certificates Public Record?\n\nA California death certificate is an official document that is part of the public record. It provides personal information, the record of death, relatives, spouse as well as a multitude of other information about the deceased. These records are maintained by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and can typically only be requested by immediate family. Much of this information is included on the viewable California death record except the SSN and cause of death, which are typically only available on the official CA death certificate\n\nWhat Is Included on a California Death Certificate\n\nFull name of the deceased The date and location of their death Age at the time of death Sex or how they identify Their occupation if not retired Employer and job title Academic certificates Last known residence Marital status Ethnicity Date of birth Place of birth, state, county, and country SSN Social Security Number (only on a death certificate) Name of the surviving spouse if they were married Name of their father Name of their mother and her maiden name Cause of death if known Medical examiner, coroner, or physician Autopsy information if applicable (only on a death certificate) Name and place of burial or cremation California registrar signature and state seal\n\nIt is important to note that some death certificate information may vary depending on what information is available and recorded. The cause of death is not always known so if there is any question of a person\u2019s passing, and no autopsy was performed then the cause of death in California might not be known or recorded. Other specific details such as the SSN of the deceased is not part of the public record and will not be viewable on public record websites that offer access to California death records.\n\nOnline Access To California Death Records\n\nMost people that are looking for California death record information are interested in verifying a death of a friend, relative or someone they knew in their past. This type of California death record is unofficial and since it is part of a person\u2019s public record, anyone can lookup this information. Unofficial death verifications can be performed with any number of the online public record websites that offer access to vital records which also include birth, marriage and divorce records. All you\u2019ll need is the full name of the person in question, the state they call home and their date of birth. These are all important factors in finding the correct death record for the right person as many people in the United States have the same first and last name. It\u2019s also important to note that unofficial CA death record information can only be used for verification purposes and research as they are not official government documents. Only a spouse or immediate family can obtain the official documentation of a person\u2019s death in California.\n\nLeading Causes of Death in California\n\nAccording to the California Health and Human Services Department, there were more than 270,000 deaths in 2022 and the following are the leading causes of death in California:\n\nThe leading cause of death in California, as well as the entire United States, was Heart Disease in 2022. Cancer was the second on the list of leading causes of death, in which there is a wide range of several types of cancer that fit into this list. The top cancer related deaths being lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. Stroke, which accounts for over 16,000 deaths in 2022 Alzheimer\u2019s Disease which is the most common form of dementia that affects a person\u2019s cognitive abilities and eventually can lead to a premature death. Respiratory Diseases which can include Covid and influenza and pneumonia. Hypertension is one that most people do not easily recognize which can lead to heart attack and death. This can be attributed to genetic influences and lifestyle choices. Liver Disease which is also known as Cirrhosis. This can lead to organ failure and death\n\nAdditional information about specific causes of death can be found by visiting the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

Stanley Finch was the first Chief (now called Director).\n\nIn 1914, when he was only 6 years old, in August, the Panama Canal opened to traffic. Begun by the French in the 1880's and abandoned, the United States undertook further construction in 1904.

It was the U.S.'s first major broadcast network.

We will miss our friend and colleague.\u201d\n\n\u201cFood is never just food \u2013 it always has a narrative,\u201d Miller said on the occasion of his joining Coast. \u201cThe more you know the history and story of food \u2013 its role in our shared cultural heritage \u2014 the better it tastes.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated on this for MRM magazine.\n\n\"There are many ways that we get culture: music, science, art, literature, but there is only one sort of culture that we get daily, usually multiple times a day, and that is food culture. As the saying goes, you tell me what you eat and I will tell you where you\u2019re from. Food makes us who we are both literally and figuratively. Food is also how we learn about others. It is often our first and most important means of accessing a different culture. You may not be familiar with traditional Japanese koto music, but chances are you enjoy sushi on a regular basis. Every plate, every dish, has a story to tell. As a culinary instructor I often asked my students what story did they intend? When we prepare a meal, we must remember that we are feeding not only the body, but the mind and soul as well.\"\n\nThe avid food historian also stressed with us how \"food is the foundation of civilization.\"\n\n\"Without the rise of agriculture, there would be no history at all,\" he said. \"And although the history of food is not as glamorous as say, military history, it has, in many ways, had a greater impact on humanity than almost any other aspect of history. Even the simplest things often have a fascinating story. Fish & chips \u2013 which we think of as British \u2013 actually traces its roots back to a Medieval Arabic dish: al-sikbaj. This was a vinegar lamb stew with sweeteners and spices. As the dish made its way from the Fertile Crescent to the Mediterranean, fish were substituted for lamb, with the fish frequently fried prior to being marinated in vinegar.\n\nIn Spain al-sikbaj thus became escabeche. From there the dish was brought to Northern Europe in the 16th century by Jewish refugees from Spanish persecution. This fried fish, \u201cin the Jewish style,\u201d would be married with fried potatoes in the 19th century to create the \u201cEnglish\u201d classic. Heavy on the malt vinegar for me, please. And don\u2019t forget to fry them in beef tallow, the original frying medium for this dish.\"\n\nViewing, which is open to the public, is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 1, from 12:30 p.m. to 4 p.m. at Rose Hills in Whittier, and then at Latter Day Saints Chapel in Rosemead, from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m."}]}
