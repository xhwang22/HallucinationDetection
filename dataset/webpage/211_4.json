{"Casey Serin declared bankruptcy in 2008.": [{"url": "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/lehman-brothers-collapse.asp", "page_content": "Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008. Hundreds of employees, mostly dressed in business suits, left the bank's offices one by one with boxes in their hands. It was a somber reminder that nothing is forever\u2014even in the richness of the financial and investment world.\n\nAt the time of its collapse, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States with 25,000 employees worldwide. It had $639 billion in assets and $613 billion in liabilities. The bank became a symbol of the excesses of the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, engulfed by the subprime meltdown that swept through financial markets and cost an estimated $10 trillion in lost economic output.\n\nIn this article, we examine the events that led to the collapse of Lehman Brothers.\n\nKey Takeaways Lehman Brothers had humble beginnings as a dry-goods store, but eventually branched off into commodities trading and brokerage services.\n\nThe firm survived many challenges but was eventually brought down by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.\n\nLehman first got into mortgage-backed securities in the early 2000s before acquiring five mortgage lenders.\n\nThe firm posted multiple, consecutive losses and its share price dropped.\n\nLehman filed for bankruptcy on September 15, 2008, with $639 billion in assets and $619 billion in debt.\n\nLehman Brothers History\n\nLehman Brothers had humble origins, tracing its roots to a general store founded by German brothers Henry, Emanuel and Mayer Lehman in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1844. Farmers paid for their goods with cotton, which led the company into the cotton trade. After Henry died, the other Lehman brothers expanded the scope of the business into commodities trading and brokerage services.\n\nThe firm prospered over the following decades as the U.S. economy grew into an international powerhouse. But Lehman faced plenty of challenges over the years. The company survived the railroad bankruptcies of the 1800s, the Great Depression, two world wars, a capital shortage when it was spun off by American Express (AXP) in 1994 in an initial public offering, and the Long Term Capital Management collapse and Russian debt default of 1998.\n\nDespite its ability to survive past disasters, the collapse of the U.S. housing market ultimately brought Lehman to its knees, as its headlong rush into the subprime mortgage market proved to be a disastrous step.\n\nThe Prime Culprit\n\nThe company, along with many other financial firms, branched into mortgage-backed securities and collateral debt obligations. In 2003 and 2004, with the U.S. housing bubble well under way, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders along with BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans. These loans were made to borrowers without full documentation.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAt first, Lehman's acquisitions seemed prescient. Lehman's real estate business enabled revenues in the capital markets unit to surge 56% from 2004 to 2006. The firm securitized $146 billion of mortgages in 2006\u2014a 10% increase from 2005. Lehman reported record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, it announced $4.2 billion in net income on $19.3 billion in revenue.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe Colossal Miscalculation\n\nIn February 2007, Lehman's stock price reached a record $86.18 per share, giving it a market capitalization of nearly $60 billion.\ufeff\ufeff But by the first quarter of 2007, cracks in the U.S. housing market were already becoming apparent. Defaults on subprime mortgages began to rise to a seven-year high. On March 14, 2007, a day after the stock had its biggest one-day drop in five years on concerns that rising defaults would affect Lehman's profitability, the firm reported record revenues and profit for its fiscal first quarter. Following the earnings report, Lehman said the risks posed by rising home delinquencies were well contained and would have little impact on the firm's earnings.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe Beginning of the End\n\nLehman's stock fell sharply as the credit crisis erupted in August 2007 with the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds. During that month, the company eliminated 1,200 mortgage-related jobs and shut down its BNC unit.\ufeff\ufeff It also closed offices of Alt-A lender Aurora in three states. Even as the correction in the U.S. housing market gained momentum, Lehman continued to be a major player in the mortgage market.\n\nIn 2007, Lehman underwrote more mortgage-backed securities than any other firm, accumulating an $85 billion portfolio, or four times its shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lehman's stock rebounded, as global equity markets reached new highs and prices for fixed-income assets staged a temporary rebound. However, the firm did not take the opportunity to trim its massive mortgage portfolio, which in retrospect, would turn out to be its last chance.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nHurling Toward Failure\n\nIn 2007, Lehman's high degree of leverage was 31, while its large mortgage securities portfolio made it highly susceptible to the deteriorating market conditions. On March 17, 2008, due to concerns that Lehman would be the next Wall Street firm to fail following Bear Stearns' near-collapse, its shares plummeted nearly 48%.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nBy April, after an issue of preferred stock\u2014which was convertible into Lehman shares at a 32% premium to its concurrent price\u2014yielded $4 billion, confidence in the firm returned somewhat.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff However, the stock resumed its decline as hedge fund managers began to question the valuation of Lehman's mortgage portfolio.\n\nOn June 7, 2008, Lehman announced a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, its first loss since it was spun off by American Express, and reported that it raised another $6 billion from investors by June 12.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff According to David P. Belmont, \"The firm also said it boosted its liquidity pool to an estimated $45 billion, decreased gross assets by $147 billion, reduced its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages by 20%, and cut down leverage from a factor of 32 to about 25.\"\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nToo Little, Too Late\n\nThese measures were perceived as being too little, too late. Over the summer, Lehman's management made unsuccessful overtures to a number of potential partners. The stock plunged 77% in the first week of September 2008, amid plummeting equity markets worldwide, as investors questioned CEO Richard Fuld's plan to keep the firm independent by selling part of its asset management unit and spinning off commercial real estate assets. Hopes that the Korea Development Bank would take a stake in Lehman were dashed on September 9, as the state-owned South Korean bank put talks on hold.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe devastating news lead to a 45% drop in Lehman's stock, along with the firm's debt suffering a 66% increase in credit-default swaps.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff Hedge fund clients began abandoning the company, with short-term creditors following suit. Lehman's fragile financial position was best emphasized by the pitiful results of its September 10 fiscal third-quarter report.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nFacing a $3.9 billion loss, which included a $5.6 billion write-down, the firm announced an extensive strategic corporate restructuring effort. Moody's Investor Service also announced that it was reviewing Lehman's credit ratings, and it found that the only way for Lehman to avoid a rating downgrade would be to sell a majority stake to a strategic partner. By September 11, the stock had suffered another massive plunge (42%) due to these developments.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nWith only $1 billion left in cash by the end of that week, Lehman was quickly running out of time. Over the weekend of September 13, Lehman, Barclays, and Bank of America (BAC) made a last-ditch effort to facilitate a takeover of the former, but they were ultimately unsuccessful.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff On Monday, September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy, resulting in the stock plunging 93% from its previous close on September 12.\n\nLehman stock plunged 93% between the close of trading on September 12, 2008, and the day it declared bankruptcy.\n\nWhere are They Now?\n\nFormer chair and CEO Richard Fuld runs Matrix Private Capital Group, which he founded in 2016. The company manages assets for high-net worth individuals, family offices and institutions. He reportedly sold an apartment in New York City for $25.9 million as well as a collection of drawings for $13.5 million.\n\nIn years following the collapse, Fuld acknowledged the mistakes the bank made though he remained critical of the government for mandating that Lehman Brothers file for bankruptcy while bailing out others. In 2010, he told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission the bank had adequate capital reserves and a solid business at the time of its bankruptcy.\n\nErin Callan (now Erin Montella) became chief financial officer at the age of 41 and resigned in June 2008 following suspicions she had leaked information to the press. Her LinkedIN profile lists her as an advisor at Matrix Investment Holdings. Other stints include six months serving as head of hedge fund coverage for Credit Suisse and co-founding a non-profit that provides paid maternity leave to mothers. In 2016, Montella published an autobiography, Full Circle: A Memoir of Leaning in Too Far and the Journey Back, about her experiences in the financial world.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nLehman's collapse roiled global financial markets for weeks, given its size and status in the U.S. and globally. At its peak, Lehman had a market value of nearly $46 billion, which was wiped out in the months leading up to its bankruptcy.\n\nMany questioned the decision to allow Lehman to fail, compared with the government's tacit support for Bear Stearns, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in March 2008. Bank of America had been in talks to buy Lehman, but backed away after the government refused to help with Lehman's most troubled assets. Instead, Bank of America announced it would buy Merrill Lynch on the same day Lehman filed for bankruptcy."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/casey_serin/final_iaff_moments", "page_content": "Final IAFF Moments\n\nIn April 2007, Serin appeared on The Suze Orman Show to discuss his financial predicament. Orman recommended that Serin file for bankruptcy and attempt to increase his take-home pay. However, Serin continued to make no effort to secure full-time employment, nor did he file bankruptcy; a bankruptcy attorney had told Serin that he would open himself to potential charges of mortgage fraud if he filed for bankruptcy, since the debts were acquired under fraudulent pretenses.\n\nThe final month of the blog saw further erratic behavior by Serin; specifically, Serin took a spur-of-the-moment trip to Australia without informing his wife or family members.\n\nAs for his real estate investments, Serin acknowledged to the Sydney Morning Herald that \"the stuff I did is technically mortgage fraud, but it's not officially called that until someone prosecutes me and proves that that is indeed mortgage fraud,\" asserting a presumption of innocence. On the Jon Ronson show, Serin confirmed his use of so-called \"liar loans\". On July 11, 2007, Serin disclosed that he was under investigation by the FBI. In an interview conducted by ABC News, his attorney reported that Casey Serin is under investigation by the FBI, but \"no charges have been brought against Mr. Serin. However, based upon conversations with the U.S. attorney's office in California, federal charges related to Mr. Serin's real estate transactions are expected to be brought against him\".\n\nAs of 07/28/2007, Casey's commentary on iamfacingforeclosure has been removed. His final entry was dedicated to his wife. Aaron Krowne, an Emory University library researcher and owner of ml-implode.com, purchased the blog. Serin says he used proceeds from the sale to pay off $35,000 of consumer credit debt in his wife's name."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3030705&page=1", "page_content": "July 27, 2007 \u2014 -- In Sacramento, Calif., not far from where prospectors sought quick riches in the gold rush more than a century ago, another speculative boom is going bust.\n\nThis time, however, it's not the lure of precious metals -- it's real estate.\n\n\"The market was hot, and I decided to give it a shot,\" said Casey Serin, a modern-day speculator who hoped to strike it rich quick by buying homes, fixing them up and then flipping them for a profit.\n\nSerin said he has always had an entrepreneurial spirit. Born in Uzbekistan, the 24-year-old came to the United States with his family in 1994 and became a U.S. citizen nine years later.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, he found a full-time job as a Web site programmer. But Serin was always interested in starting his own business.\n\nIn particular, he was drawn to real estate. So Serin attended real estate seminars and bought how-to CDs, DVDs and books.\n\n\"My first set of seminars was $15,000,\" he said. He was hooked, eventually spending nearly $35,000 on what he calls his real estate education.\n\n\"I kept spending because I thought, 'I need more education,'\" Serin said.\n\nAnd after he made a profit buying and selling one property, he eventually jumped into the real estate boom that was gripping the nation.\n\n\"My first deal was $30,000. I got a bit of euphoria. I thought I could do this more and more. Exuberant feelings led me to buy more property.\"\n\nStarting in 2005 Serin went on a real estate shopping binge, buying eight homes in eight months in four different states. Along the way, he quit his job to devote himself full-time to real estate investing.\n\nIn October 2005, he bought one home in Sacramento, then another one in January 2006. The next month, he purchased two properties in New Mexico. Next, he closed on a home in Modesto, Calif. In March 2006, he bought a home, sight unseen, in Utah as well as another in California.\n\nIn May of that year, he bought a home in Dallas, the same way he bought the house in Utah -- sight unseen.\n\nIn all, he acquired eight homes over eight months, and a lot of debt.\n\n\"In total I was $2.2 million in debt between mortgages and unsecured lines of credit and credit cards,\" said Serin.\n\n\"It was a very tough thing to face.\"\n\nSerin's problems started when the home repairs often took longer than expected.\n\n\"My goal was always to fix up the house and resell it for profit quickly,\" he said, \"say within three to four months. [The] problem is three to four months turned into six months, and then my money ran out, and I couldn't finish fixing it.\"\n\nAnother problem was timing.\n\nSerin started buying just as the real estate market boom was going bust. His houses sat unsold, and his debt continued to climb.\n\n\"I created a logistical nightmare for myself trying to do too many properties too fast. And what happened was, I ran out of money,\" he said.\n\nTo make matters worse, Serin told ABC News that he purchased his homes using what are known in the lending industry as \"low documentation\" loans. With these mortgages, borrowers provide limited documentation -- or proof -- to confirm their income and assets, and lenders base loans on that information with little to no verification.\n\nSerin said that he told lenders on his loan applications that he was making more than his actual salary of $50,000 a year from his computer job.\n\n\"I ended up stating more than I was really making because I was able to take advantage of what's called 'stated income loans,'\" he said. \"In the industry they call them 'liar loans,' because the bank basically allows you to state anything you want.\"\n\n\"Low doc\" and \"no doc\" loans were originally intended for the self-employed, whose income can vary year to year or for the very wealthy, who don't want to disclose their earnings.\n\n\"Low-doc and no-doc [are] very viable \u2026 for a certain segment of the buying public,\" explained Ed Smith of the California Association of Mortgage Brokers. \"For example, a person with high credit scores, the ability to make their payments, a long-term history of being financially prudent with their finances -- however, they don't want to disclose full documentation of their income.\"\n\nBut as home prices soared, especially in states such as California, lenders loosened credit requirements and made these loans available to more people.\n\nThese higher-risk loans also came with higher interest rates. It is many of those borrowers -- like Casey Serin -- who are now having problems making their mortgage payments.\n\n\"The [loan] products that were available were mismatched in many cases with the wrong customer's financial profile,\" said Smith. \"Many customers got into loan products that were ill-advised or maybe not well thought out. There's no such thing as a bad loan; there's loan products that fit everyone's individual profile.\"\n\nZach Gast. who analyzes the mortgage lending industry for the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, said pressure on lenders to continue making loans as home prices increased led to a loosening of lending standards.\n\n\"The standards dropped in nearly everything you can imagine,\" he said. \"Borrowers were not required to provide documentation of their income. They paid less in down payments. And they were also allowed to have higher mortgage payments as a percentage of their income.\"\n\nAccording to Credit Suisse, an international financial services group, \"low/no doc\" loans accounted for nearly half of all home purchase loans issued in 2006 in the United States, up from only 18 percent in 2001.\n\nSerin admitted he lied about his income on his applications.\n\n\"It was fairly common to do stated income loans. I thought, well this must be gray area. It's kind of like speeding on the freeway. Everybody does it. As long as you do it within reason, it's all right. Well, I crashed my car.\"\n\nAnd as his homes sat unsold and he couldn't make the payments, he continued to dig himself deeper and deeper into debt.\n\nPart of that debt was a result of how he structured his mortgage deals, where he not only got a home a closing, he got cash back. Serin said he used the money to fix up the properties as well as to live on, something that could possibly land him in trouble with law enforcement.\n\n\"I was able to structure the deals in such a way to where I will borrow 100 percent of the value and find a way to have the seller give me of the money back for my repairs.\"\n\nHe didn't think it was illegal because, as he put it, \"I just thought as long as it was a win-win deal, it was all good.\"\n\nAccording to his attorney, Serin is currently under investigation by the FBI. His attorney, Kevin Mark Wray, told ABC News that \"as of yet, no charges have been brought against Mr. Serin. However, based upon conversations with the U.S. attorney's office in California, federal charges related to Mr. Serin's real estate transactions are expected to be brought against him. At this time, my office is reviewing Mr. Serin's real estate transactions. I have engaged an expert on mortgage law and mortgage foreclosure. I expect to have a complete response in the next two weeks.\"\n\nEven before the investigation began, debt collectors were harassing Serin, and his mailbox was filling up with delinquent notices. Eventually, his lenders started foreclosure procedures.According to Serin's Web site, five of his eight homes have been foreclosed on, two of his homes have been sold and one is under contract to be sold.\n\nDespite what he has done, Serin has been remarkably candid about his actions. He started a Web site where he posted everything from pictures of his homes to a detailed list of his personal finances. His blog, which started out as a place for him to share his experiences with others, later became a possible business opportunity. \"The entrepreneur in me thought, 'Hey, this is great. I can maybe leverage this into some other business later on.'\"\n\n\"There was a time where I was embarrassed,\" he said, \"but after a while I decided, you know what? What's there to be ashamed about? Successful people go through several of these, you know. Failure is part of success.\"\n\nSerin once envisioned the Web site and blog becoming a place where people facing foreclosure could learn about what to expect, as well as what options might be available to them. However, the attention from the media, Web watchers and legal authorities has become too difficult for him. He recently sold the domain and will soon stop blogging about his activities. For those who loved (and hated) his adventures in real estate, as of after Friday, August 3, Serin's story, as told online, is expected to end.\n\n\"I have a lot of critics that say because of me, the market is overpriced,\" he said. \"Because of me, the renters are priced out. It's interesting. I've been put in a position where I'm blamed for macroeconomic problems. I'm kind of like a mascot for what's really going on.\"\n\nCommentators on Serin's and their own blogs also express anger at Serin's lifestyle.\n\n\"I make things worse by telling them part of the money last year was used for my wife, and I to go on vacation. Well, people don't realize this is one thing we did. Everything else was very frugal,\" he said.\n\n\"We have scaled back in a lot of ways, and we have cut our expenses down. But what happens is people focus on the drama. They see that I'm supposedly living a frivolous lifestyle, they see that I went to a Starbucks or a Jamba Juice \u2026 and they say, 'You need to be on rice and beans all the time. You need to be eating Top Ramen all day.'\"\n\nSerin maintains that his critics don't realize the severity of his situation.\n\n\"You can't just send $5 toward your credit card; they will still continue their collection process,\" he said. \"With foreclosures you can't just pay them a partial payment. They will still do the foreclosure.\"\n\nWhile Serin wants to work out deals for his remaining debt, he said he is trying his best to avoid declaring bankruptcy.\n\n\"People say maybe you should give up after eight bad deals,\" he said. \"Well, I'd like to say they weren't all bad, and I have learned a lot through it. So I'd like to think the next deal I am going to do is going to be successful.\"\n\nSo, Serin continues to search for his eureka moment and hopes to strike gold.\n\nPortions of this report originally aired April 13, 2007."}, {"url": "https://www.cnet.com/culture/notorious-debtor-casey-serin-shuts-down-blog/", "page_content": "Casey Serin, the 24-year-old would-be real estate mogul who was reduced to sharing a diminutive West Sacramento, Calif., townhouse with his sister-in-law, announced on Thursday that iamfacingforeclosure.com is dead and \"will never return.\"\n\nSince the blog's launch in September, Serin's regular posts about his refusal to get a job or pay off up to $420,000 that he owes creditors have garnered him an enthusiastic--if unrelentingly critical--audience known as \"haterz.\"\n\nAlong the way, Serin's notoriety\n\nGilligan's Island\n\nled to appearances on Suze Orman's and Robert Kiyosaki's advice shows, and the creation of an encyclopedia, Caseypedia.com , with hundreds of entries mocking his exploits.

It specifies that the iamfacingforeclosure.com site must be shuttered \"permanently never to be reopened again\" if Serin did not generate $1,000 in income a week or if he discussed his marital problems publicly--an arrangement that one site said was violated.\n\nIn an earlier conversation with CNET News.com, Galina Serin said she was becoming frustrated with her husband's credit-based spending and had met with her pastor recently for relationship counseling. Of eight homes that her husband hoped to resell at a profit, he lost all of them, most to foreclosure.\n\nEarlier, Serin had talked favorably about being homeless and living in a car and said his wife was holding him back. After signing the contract, he generally refrained from discussing family members, though his brother Steve did berate him publicly for his antics and not supporting his wife.\n\nAnti-Serin sites expressed dismay at the apparent end of iamfacingforeclosure.com, comparing Serin-watching to a form of drug addiction.

It was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at that time, and it was among the most significant events of the financial crisis of 2007\u201308.\n\nLehman Brothers was founded in 1850 by three brothers who emigrated to the United States from Germany, initially running a store in the South. But they soon turned to cotton trading and shifted operations to New York. Lehman remained a commodities house until the early 20th century, when its focus switched to public offerings, laying the foundations for a financial-services institution that would become one of the world\u2019s most significant investment banks.\n\nBy 2008, after a short-lived merger with American Express, Lehman had reinvented itself as an independent asset-management company, with over 28,000 employees and more than $600 billion in assets. But there had been difficulties along the way: its World Trade Centre offices were destroyed in the September 11 attacks, and it had paid significant penalties to regulators over the way the bank\u2019s investment division influenced the findings of its research analysts.\n\nThese episodes paled into insignificance during 2008. Lehman was heavily involved in the subprime lending business, an activity that was driving unsustainable economic growth. But these were by definition the riskiest of loans, to consumers with low income and poor credit histories. Despite suffering a $50 million loss by closing its own subprime mortgage lender in 2007, Lehman was still exposed. When securitizing vast mortgage packages for onward sale, the company sold the best mortgages and kept the worst, a decision that proved catastrophic.\n\nHuge losses were reported, and Lehman Brothers stock lost three-quarters of its value\u2014and then plunged again when rumours of a takeover came to nothing. A mass exodus of clients took place, the firm\u2019s assets were drastically downgraded by credit agencies, and the U.S. federal government refused to take action to help prevent the firm\u2019s collapse. Lehman Brothers was forced to file for bankruptcy in September 2008.

That\u2019s the beauty (and the built-in problem) of Wikipedia is that anybody can edit.\n\nI myself don\u2019t want to get involved because I don\u2019t want to be accused of trying to spin my story. Instead, I\u2019m going to leave my thoughts and additional details below and hopefully I can get can some positive support in editing my Wikipedia entry.\n\nHere is my take\u2026\n\nCasey Serin (born September 10, 1982) is a failed real estate investor who, at the age of 24, became known as the \u201cposter child for everything that went wrong in the real estate boom\u201d. Serin was born in Uzbekistan and emigrated to America in the mid-1990s. In his early twenties, Serin was working as a php script programmer for Pride Industries. (a group that employs mentally disabled people), but he decided to quit this job with the hope of earning a living flipping houses. Beginning in October 2005 and continuing through the following year, Serin purchased eight houses in various U.S. states, and then began blogging about the process of facing foreclosure on several of the properties he was unable to sell before his money ran out. Background Although Serin was unemployed (with no ostensible income) when he bought the houses, he chose to declare on his loan applications that he was employed and earned a steady income\u2026\n\nI was employed at Pride Industries for over a year (Since Aug 2005 2004) making $50,000/yr salary when I applied for the Calla Way, Sacramento house in September/October 2005. My income was just shy of doing a full-doc loan so we had to go stated-income. The income was stated a little higher then I was really making in order to qualify. I was told this was a common and allowable industry practice.\n\nI bought the house slightly under value ($330K) with built-in $30K of equity which I chose to cash-out right at purchase by buying at full appraisal value of $360K with 100% financing. (My FICO score was only about 630, I think). I used the money to pay off our $30K of credit cards: about 15K was from Russ Whitney RE seminars and the rest was expenses from wedding in 2004 and miscellaneous consumer debt.\n\nAfter some cleaning I immediately started marketing Calla Way myself (without an agent) in order to sell it at retail quickly and pay off my loan. I ended up selling the house on January 4th for full retail value (360K+costs) and simultaneously buying the buyer\u2019s old house \u2013 Burdett Way, Sacramento. I didn\u2019t want to lose the buyer and didn\u2019t want to wait for their old house to sell so I put the transaction together to where we bought each other\u2019s houses. This allowed me to secure the $30,000 as profit which up to that point was really part of the original loan.\n\nThe truth is I was a bit desperate to sell Calla Way because I didn\u2019t want to start making payments on it and I knew the market was starting to reverse so I had to act quickly and make the deal work. I also got a little emotionally involved when I found out the buyer is a family trying to move to a better school district and safer neighborhood for the kids. I wanted to help them out and ended up paying too much for Burdett considering its condition and location. I figured trading down to a lower mortgage amount (295K) was still a smart move because it will be easier to service the payments.\n\nBy the way, I applied for Burdett property while still being employed at Pride Industries but had to use a stated income loan again. The stated income was within reasonable parameters for my job title (Programmer/Analyst) and it was justifiable at the time based on the advice I\u2019ve been given by the real estate professionals working with me.\n\nAfter that I tried to lease option the Burdett property while looking for more deals. Since paying off my credit cards my score went up to around 680. I was ready for more action.\n\nIn early January 2006 I took a 3 week leave of absence from my job at Pride Industries and flew with some investors to Albuquerque, New Mexico, which was a hot area for investing. There I put two houses under contract (Sonora Way and Guadalajara).\n\nI came back to my job and found myself so busy managing all these deals that it was starting to affect my programming job performance in a big way. I didn\u2019t feel it was fair to my employer to be doing my business on company time. So I ended up resigning from my job the same week and (end of January 2006) to pursue real estate investing/flipping full time.\n\nI also had a side business doing freelance web design, web application development and hosting. I\u2019ve have been doing the web business on and off for the last 10 years. I used the business to qualify for all of the loans going forward. Since it was hard to verify income from the business continued to use stated-income loans.\n\nThe only loan where I didn\u2019t state my income was the Angleridge property in Dallas. There I got a loan from a hard money lender and they normally don\u2019t even check credit because they only lend upto 65% LTV and thus are pretty secure with just the collateral.\n\n\u2026 Serin has repeatedly admitted that he lied on his loan applications regarding his employment and his intention to reside in the purchased homes. To avoid lenders seeing that he had taken out multiple loans, he used several lenders for the various properties, and filled out the loan applications within a short time frame, so that the loans would not have sufficient time to appear during a credit check\u2026\n\nSee my explanation of employment above. I did not lie about employment but I did state my income (within reason) to meet the debt-to-income ratio for each particular loan amount.\n\nI did run each each loan as an \u201cowner occupied property\u201d or as a \u201csecond home\u201d in order to qualify for 100% financing. I didn\u2019t have any other properties at the time and I was buying all of them so fast that the credit report didn\u2019t show all the other loans right away. This allowed me to justify the owner-occupied or second-home status. At the time this seemed OK to me and the professionals I was working with.\n\n\u2026 In addition, he received cash back at closing on most of the properties \u2014 for his California properties, Serin received more than California\u2019s legal maximum rate of 3 percent of the selling price.\n\nYes, I got cash back at closing through different methods. Sometimes disclosed on the closing statement, sometimes not. Either way I didn\u2019t realize this was fraudulent behavior, I just thought the lenders didn\u2019t like it. I definitely didn\u2019t think I was committing any kind of a crime.\n\nCash-back at close is a pretty common technique among the real estate investors and associates that I collaborated with at the local investment clubs. I just thought it was a great way to finance repairs and payments for the fix-n-flip investment strategy.\n\nThe cash-back money was spent on both the mortgage payments for the houses, and on various luxuries such as a Hawaiian vacation for Serin and his wife.\n\nAlmost all of the cash-back went toward the repairs and servicing the 15-20K monthly burn-rate on 6 properties (at the peak) which includes mortgage payments, taxes, insurance, utilities, travel expenses, etc. Some of the money (about 15K, I think) went toward additional real estate seminars so I can get better and learn new techniques.\n\nWe also used the money for living expenses since this was our main business during 2006. The goal was to buy at wholesale, take some of the equity out at close, pay a few payments, fix up the properties and sell at retail and pickup an additional profit on the sale. Since I quit my programmer job I had to use some of the cash-back to live on while we wait for the houses to sell.\n\nI never intended to commit any kind of fraud by taking the cash out and letting the property foreclose. My goal was to make a business out of it. I simply got overzealous and made some beginner mistakes. How many new business owners don\u2019t make any mistakes?\n\nAnd yes, I did take my wife for a surprise anniversary trip to Hawaii. We haven\u2019t gone on a real vacation since we got married and I wanted to do something special for her. This was not a lavish or extravagant trip by any means. We even saved money by living with a friend for part of the week.\n\nIn a matter of months, the money largely ran out, and Serin is now 2.2 million dollars in debt, with a net worth of around negative $600,000. Interest in his blog at developed first among readers of blogs devoted to the United States housing bubble. His story was featured in USA Today, National Public Radio, and the San Francisco Chronicle, among other mainstream media. An online discussion of the fraudulent nature of overstating income in stated income loan applications uses the case of Serin as a running example. Many readers of the blog initially encouraged Serin to contact an attorney in the hopes of discharging at least a portion of his debt by filing bankruptcy. Serin has largely ignored this relatively sound advice, in favor of essentially ignoring the problem and letting his debt burden grow daily.\n\nI did consult a couple of different bankruptcy on several occasions. Filing bankruptcy is not a magic pill and has many consequences and issues that need to be considered. Every case is different depending on the desired outcome.\n\nIn my case I chose to avoid bankruptcy and attempt to pay back the debt by selling the houses and/or pay back most of it by doing a short sale and avoiding foreclosure on my credit score. If I was to declare bankruptcy it would have interfered with the short sale process and would have forced all the lenders to foreclose on me for sure. (With the exception of maybe one of the homes if I would choose to move into it.)\n\nChapter 7 bankruptcy doesn\u2019t prevent foreclosure, it simply delays it 1-3 months. The secured lenders still have the right to liquidate the asset and will exercise that right in order to minimize loses. Even if my mortgage is discharged in bankruptcy the lenders still get to foreclose on the house \u2013 their collateral. Then I would have both a bankruptcy AND a foreclosure on my credit.\n\nChapter 13 bankruptcy (the repayment plan) wouldn\u2019t have helped me much either because I didn\u2019t have a stable income or a large enough income to try to negotiate a repayment plan on 6 houses. Chance are I would probably miss a payment and the houses go right back into foreclosure. I didn\u2019t want to sight up for something I can\u2019t commit. Even if I was to get a job there is no way I can earn enough per month to get on a repayment plan to catchup and float the amount of debt I have/had. Chapter 13 would also prevent me from doing a short sale on the properties and avoid foreclosure on my record.\n\nAnybody who says \u201cwhy don\u2019t just declare bankruptcy\u201d without considering all of the issues above obviously doesn\u2019t know what their talking about. On the moral side, I felt declaring bankruptcy would have been equal to giving up the fight and walking away instead of trying to make it right.\n\nVarious readers of Serin\u2019s blog have estimated that the interest on his debt is growing at the rate of approximately $600 per day. Serin has been referred to as the \u201cpied piper of financial ruin\u201d, and his plans for remedying his debt have many readers wondering if he is being overly optimistic, or if he is in denial over the gravity of his financial situation. In early 2007, Serin set his goals for returning to fiscal solvency \u2014 he plans on amassing an even greater debt burden by attempting to purchase an apartment complex.\n\nPerhaps the apartment idea was a bit extreme. But what am I going to gain be being a pessimist?? Positive thinking is what kept me going all these months. Sure, some of my ideas get a little crazy but I didn\u2019t want to just give up without a fight. \u201cYou miss 100% of the shots you don\u2019t take\u201d is the quote that comes to mind.\n\nIn addition, Serin has proposed to transfer his personal debts to a shell corporation purchased with the sole aim of hiding his debt, a course of action that numerous people have advised him is blatantly illegal. Serin initially conceded that there might be something \u201cshady\u201d about his proposal, although he has gone so far as talking to a corporate attorney about the plan.\n\nSee the problem with my haters critics is that most of them don\u2019t understand enough about what I\u2019m doing to give me competent advice. Everybody is quick to judge and since they have already made up their minds about me, everything I do is going to be \u201cshady\u201d to them.\n\nBuying an existing corporation and applying for cash lines of credit with the help of a credit partner is a perfectly acceptable and legal business practice. I can even borrow from the corporation to refinance my person credit, as long as that\u2019s not the only purpose of the corporation\u2019s existence. My goal was to continue doing real estate and other types of investing with my corporation. So I may or may not use the cash lines of credit to refinance my debt. There are several issues to consider and I\u2019m still in the process of seeking advice and figuring all that out.\n\nDespite his repeated public admissions (both via the blog and on a webcam video) of lying on loan applications and committing felony mortgage fraud, Serin has not yet been arrested for these crimes \u2014 although IP logs of the visitors to his blog have shown that the blog has been accessed by the FBI, the IRS, the SEC, various state governments, and banks from which his fraudulent loans were obtained. Various readers of the blog, angry at Serin\u2019s complete inaction, have attempted to alert the relevant authorities to Serin\u2019s blog. In early 2007, Serin started up two further real estate websites: ablebuyer.com and buyingapartmentbuildings.com, though the second address now directs visitors to the first. Criticism Serin is regularly criticized on both his blog and other blogs specifically devoted to his story. A number of specific criticisms that have been leveled at Serin include: * Disdain for standard university education in lieu of real estate guru seminars, for which Serin spent over $30,000, including training at [NRU].\n\nI have nothing against standard college education. Colleges teach you how to be a good employee. Nothing wrong with that because everybody needs to have a job for stability at some point in their lives. Going to college will make you more employable and you will make more money. But a job will not make you truly financially independent.\n\nI decided to go straight for the business owner / entrepreneur / investor route and those skills are not typically acquired through college (though college can help with some aspects of it). I still have a desire to go to college someday but do it purely for personal growth and for the benefits of a well-rounded education. That would be after I become financially independent.\n\nEven though I don\u2019t regret the path I\u2019ve taken I would recommend to all high school students to still go to college first, even if they want to be financially free. Just don\u2019t get too brainwashed.\n\nBy the way, NRU was only about 16K for over 30 classes and 2 years of education (a bargain compared to seminar companies). It was a private loan with flexible repayment terms which include the ability repay the loan by working it off. NRU is much more than just some fly-by-night guru seminar. They are the only real estate investing educational company to receive college credit recommendation by the American Counsel of Education (ACE). They also have local communities of investors for support, a network of positive cash-flow properties and a bunch of other benefits. And no, this blog is not some cover-up to market NRU. Again, the critics and blowing things out of proportion.\n\n* Not looking for full-time work, rather than living off his over-extended credit cards.\n\nWhy is full-time work considered the standard? I do work full-time on my own projects as a self-employed individual and do make some money there and here \u2013 technical consulting, online marketing, sales, helping other investors do deals, etc. Just because those are not traditional jobs doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. Yes, what I\u2019m doing right now is not super stable and I have/am considering a standard W2. We\u2019ll see.\n\nWhile I did continue to borrow some money AFTER facing foreclosure and starting this blog, it has been limited to trying to float my wife\u2019 credit cards and also short term loans for business purposes. We haven\u2019t been going into any more debt for living expenses much.\n\n* Not declaring bankruptcy \u2014 however, a bankruptcy attorney told Serin that he may be prosecuted for fraud if he files for bankruptcy.\n\nThat is one consideration but there are a lot of other issues with bankruptcy. See my explanation above and my prior posts about bankruptcy.\n\n* Living beyond his means \u2014 Serin\u2019s bank statements posted to his blog showed expenses relating to dining out regularly, incurring repeated overdraft fees in the process.\n\nHow can you assume a pattern from one instance of an event? I don\u2019t overdraft my checking account on a regular basis and I rarely go out to eat to nice places. But even if I do enjoy an occasional wheatgrass shot at Jamba Juice, soy latte at Starbucks, naturally-raised carnitas burrito at Chipotle, semi-healthy burger at In-n-Out or my new favorite whole-grain pasta with artichoke and grilled salmon at Macaroni Grill. Just because I\u2019m facing foreclosure doesn\u2019t mean I should stop living a normal life!\n\n* Being evasive about how he spends each day, given that he doesn\u2019t work.\n\nI have a lot of projects that I\u2019m working on and I don\u2019t want to talk about it too much because the hat\u2026 er\u2026 critics are following my every move and are ready to dish out hate on everything I do. I have a right to privacy and just because I share a lot on my blog doesn\u2019t mean I have to share every single thing I do.\n\n* Attempting to use unethical and/or illegal methods (i.e., shell corporation) to get out of debt.\n\nI already addressed this and if done right, there is nothing wrong with my corporate strategy.\n\n* Serin\u2019s determination to continue as a real estate investor despite his current abject failure in that field.\n\nFailure is part of success. Show me one successful person that has not failed a bunch of times (big or small). Failure is how we learn. Failure is good. The goal, of course, is to minimize failure by learning from it and not repeating the same mistake. I\u2019m still learning that part.\n\nDetermination to succeed is the key ingredient of those who succeed. But I don\u2019t need to explain this. It\u2019s common sense. Those of you who are telling me I\u2019m a failure because I happen to make a mistake are a bunch of babies. Grow up!!\n\nCompletely ignoring his current bills, and looking for more credit lines with subprime lenders like CashCall.\n\nThis is inaccurate. I am paying my personal bills and rent. I am NOT paying credit cards and mortgages because I can\u2019t handle the debt load at this point. And NO, I am not getting any more personal credit from CashCall or any other company. Some people love to spread false rumors.\n\n* Serin\u2019s refusal to live in any of the houses he purchased, possibly delaying the foreclosure process.\n\nHow is me living in the houses going to delay the foreclosure process? I\u2019m not living in the houses because I\u2019m trying to sell them and marketing a vacant house makes it sell much faster. Plus, many of the houses are not move-in ready. The bills and maintenance is higher in a house rather then renting a room like we\u2019re doing now. And its a waste of time and money moving around only to have to move again in a couple of months because I lost the house to foreclosure.\n\nSerin\u2019s personal eccentricities: his habitually unkempt haircut, his carrying a purse, and his obsession with juicing.\n\nWhy are you attacking my style and health choices? It\u2019s not a purse. It\u2019s a MAN bag. Big difference.\n\nInability to reconcile his purported Christian faith with his actions, particularly his mooching off his family and in-laws.\n\nI\u2019m not mooching off anybody. I\u2019m paying rent for the rooms and my family willingly helps me with food from time to time. I\u2019m in a time of distress and am blessed to have such great family support.\n\nIn addition, more than one website has arisen whose main focus is following Serin\u2019s postings and actions in a critical manner. Serin has referred to these sites as \u201chater sites\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Haters!\n\nPersonal Life Casey Konstantin Serin is married to [\u2026]. His wife does not participate in the blog or other publicity, although publicly-available documents filed with various county offices indicate that she participated in some of the financial deals. In addition, Serin has photographically documented his wife playing a part in some of the alleged rehabilitation of the properties. They currently live with Serin\u2019s sister-in-law in West Sacramento, California.\n\nIt\u2019s very obvious that my wife doesn\u2019t want to be mentioned online. Why are some people so determined to violate her privacy by posting her name everywhere? I took down pictures of her shortly after I started the blog per her request. The haters have saved cached versions of the pictures and spread them all over the internet. That\u2019s just not right.\n\nThe public record has her name because in order to hold California property in just my name as a married man I must have my wife deed her interest in the property to me upon purchase. It\u2019s a standard procedure and if you know nothing about real estate don\u2019t spread false rumors.\n\nShe was involved with my business to a degree. She went with me to some of the seminars and helped me do some of the account and administrative work. She also tried supervising contractors one time but that didn\u2019t work out very well. She was not on any of the loans except for the one in Dallas where the lender insisted to have both of us on there. Aside from that this whole real estate thing has been pretty much my baby.\n\nThemes and Catch Phrases Serin is very fond of using catchphrases and buzzwords on his blog, perhaps as a by-product of his preference for get-rich-quick gurus over conventional education. He frequently talks about finding \u201csweet deals\u201d, \u201crepaying every dirty penny\u201d, and \u201cfalling forward\u201d. These phrases are often mentioned sarcastically in his blog\u2019s comments, generally mocking Serin\u2019s exuberant optimism. Serin also likes to end postings with a cheerful \u201cIt\u2019s all good!\u201d, even at the end of a post that otherwise describes a situation of utter financial ruin. There are also numerous references to Jamba Juice and Macaroni Grill on his blog, which stem from a post on November 21, 2006, in which Serin reproduced, but later withdrew, a photo of a recent bank statement. His blog\u2019s readers immediately spotted that despite his dire financial predicament, he was still a regular customer at these establishments. With almost no money in his checking account, Serin had incurred numerous overdraft charges, and had essentially been paying upwards of $38 for a drink that normally cost less than $5. Since then, the names of these two restaurants are repeatedly cited in attached comments \u2014 usually with the intention of symbolizing examples of luxuries that Serin cannot realistically afford, but to which he nonetheless feels entitled.\n\nI\u2019ve already explained the Macaroni grill and Jamba Juice. As far as \u201ccatch phrases\u201d, those are part of my regular speech. I write this blog in a conversational style. I\u2019m not trolling, just being real.\n\n\u2026\n\nAs you can see my Wikipedia entry is filled with highly biased opinions, inacruate information, and assumptions. This is hurting my reputation and I consider it libelous. I love Wikipedia but we need to do our part to keep it fair and balanced.

But now that he's off the Internet (again), I feel OK proceeding.\n\nThis is about a young man named Casey Serin who lives in the Sacramento, California area. I first learned about him a little over two years ago when I was on a (rare) business trip and picked up the copy of USA Today sitting in front of my hotel room door. On the front page of the business section was a large photo of Casey with an article about his real estate activities.\n\nBy \"activities,\" I mean the purchase of over $2 million in various houses the then-24 year old individual with no meaningful income had purchased. In retrospect, the article about Casey was the most fantastic canary-in-a-coalmine story ever, because it showed how this completely unremarkable person was able to easily get loans (which he himself called \"liar's loans\") to buy properties, all with the hope of \"flipping\" them for a profit.\n\nNow, at this point, those of you familiar with Casey are probably interested that I'm even mentioning him (the rest of you are probably wondering where the charts are). The reason this is such an interesting topic to me is, one, how indicative Casey's experience was in the context of the \"Emperor has no clothes\" mentality of real estate investing during 2002-2006, and two, because of the astonishing subculture that grew up around Casey.\n\nOh, before I go any further, let me introduce you to the subject at hand (the lovely woman to the left is his wife, who divorced him following all the real estate insanity):\n\nThe USA Article described how his properties were in various states of foreclosure (or getting there). While he had obviously intended to make a lot of money (as he frequently referred to it, \"passive income\") off real estate, it wound up wiping out whatever money he did have, destroying his credit, and, in the end, destroying his marriage.\n\nWhen the article came out, Casey had started a web site called I Am Facing Foreclosure, which is where the entire subculture really began. His posts were mildly interesting, but the real action (sort of like Slope) was in the comments section. It didn't take long for an army of \"haterz\" to develop, and over the course of the next couple of years (and a few different blogs under different monikers), a bizarre and contentious relationship developed between Casey and his audience.\n\nThere are many, many blogs on the web about Casey's own blog (which has been shuttered\u2026\u2026\u2026again) but for me the crowning achievement in all of this is Caseypedia, which is a brilliant collection of over 700 (!) articles about everything imaginable regarding Casey Serin \u2013 from his car to his hair to the blue ball he used as a chair (which recently appeared for sale on eBay, in an attempt to squeeze a few dollars out of whatever notoriety might remain).\n\nFor me, Casey represents everything that was wrong about real estate \"investing\" in the recent era \u2013 \u2013 its laziness, overconfidence, and cluelessness. If nothing else, click on the Random Article link on Caseypedia a few times to get a sense of the place. It's brilliant, and my hat is off to its creators.\n\nOh, and good luck trading today.\n\nhttps://slopeofhope.com/2008/12/the-strange-tale-of-casey-serin.html\n\nThe Strange Tale of Casey Serin\n\nIn order to comment on this blog, you must have JavaScript installed and enabled."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/financial-crisis-of-2007-2008/Key-events-of-the-crisis", "page_content": "Key events of the crisis\n\nBeginning in 2004 a series of developments portended the coming crisis, though very few economists anticipated its vast scale. Over a two-year period (June 2004 to June 2006) the Fed raised the federal funds rate from 1.25 to 5.25 percent, inevitably resulting in more defaults from subprime borrowers holding adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Partly because of the rate increase, but also because the housing market had reached a saturation point, home sales, and thus home prices, began to fall in 2005. Many subprime mortgage holders were unable to rescue themselves by borrowing, refinancing, or selling their homes, because there were fewer buyers and because many mortgage holders now owed more on their loans than their homes were worth (they were \u201cunderwater\u201d)\u2014an increasingly common phenomenon as the crisis developed. As more and more subprime borrowers defaulted and as home prices continued to slide, MBSs based on subprime mortgages lost value, with dire consequences for the portfolios of many banks and investment firms. Indeed, because MBSs generated from the U.S. housing market had also been bought and sold in other countries (notably in western Europe), many of which had experienced their own housing bubbles, it quickly became apparent that the trouble in the United States would have global implications, though most experts insisted that the problems were not as serious as they appeared and that damage to financial markets could be contained.\n\nBy 2007 the steep decline in the value of MBSs had caused major losses at many banks, hedge funds, and mortgage lenders and forced even some large and prominent firms to liquidate hedge funds that were invested in MBSs, to appeal to the government for loans, to seek mergers with healthier companies, or to declare bankruptcy. Even firms that were not immediately threatened sustained losses in the billions of dollars, as the MBSs in which they had invested so heavily were now downgraded by credit-rating agencies, becoming \u201ctoxic\u201d (essentially worthless) assets. (Such agencies were later accused of a severe conflict of interest, because their services were paid for by the same banks whose debt securities they rated. That financial relationship initially created an incentive for agencies to assign deceptively high ratings to some MBSs, according to critics.) In April 2007 New Century Financial Corp., one of the largest subprime lenders, filed for bankruptcy, and soon afterward many other subprime lenders ceased operations. Because they could no longer fund subprime loans through the sale of MBSs, banks stopped lending to subprime customers, causing home sales and home prices to decline further, which discouraged home buying even among consumers with prime credit ratings, further depressing sales and prices. In August, France\u2019s largest bank, BNP Paribas, announced billions of dollars in losses, and another large U.S. firm, American Home Mortgage Investment Corp., declared bankruptcy.\n\nIn part because it was difficult to determine the extent of subprime debt in any given MBS (because MBSs were typically sold in pieces, mixed with other debt, and resold in capital markets as new securities in a process that could continue indefinitely), it was also difficult to assess the strength of bank portfolios containing MBSs as assets, even for the bank that owned them. Consequently, banks began to doubt one another\u2019s solvency, which led to a freeze in the federal funds market with potentially disastrous consequences. In early August the Fed began purchasing federal funds (in the form of government securities) to provide banks with more liquidity and thereby reduce the federal funds rate, which had briefly exceeded the Fed\u2019s target of 5.25 percent. Central banks in other parts of the world\u2014notably in the European Union, Australia, Canada, and Japan\u2014conducted similar open-market operations. The Fed\u2019s intervention, however, ultimately failed to stabilize the U.S. financial market, forcing the Fed to directly reduce the federal funds rate three times between September and December, to 4.25 percent. During the same period, the fifth largest mortgage lender in the United Kingdom, Northern Rock, ran out of liquid assets and appealed to the Bank of England for a loan. News of the bailout created panic among depositors and resulted in the first bank runs in the United Kingdom in 150 years. Northern Rock was nationalized by the British government in February 2008.\n\nThe crisis in the United States deepened in January 2008 as Bank of America agreed to purchase Countrywide Financial, once the country\u2019s leading mortgage lender, for $4 billion in stock, a fraction of the company\u2019s former value. In March the prestigious Wall Street investment firm Bear Stearns, having exhausted its liquid assets, was purchased by JPMorgan Chase, which itself had sustained billions of dollars in losses. Fearing that Bear Stearns\u2019s bankruptcy would threaten other major banks from which it had borrowed, the Fed facilitated the sale by assuming $30 billion of the firm\u2019s high-risk assets. Meanwhile, the Fed initiated another round of reductions in the federal funds rate, from 4.25 percent in early January to only 2 percent in April (the rate was reduced again later in the year, to 1 percent by the end of October and to effectively 0 percent in December). Although the rate cuts and other interventions during the first half of the year had some stabilizing effect, they did not end the crisis; indeed, the worst was yet to come.\n\nBy the summer of 2008 Fannie Mae (the Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation), the federally chartered corporations that dominated the secondary mortgage market (the market for buying and selling mortgage loans) were in serious trouble. Both institutions had been established to provide liquidity to mortgage lenders by buying mortgage loans and either holding them or selling them\u2014with a guarantee of principal and interest payments\u2014to other banks and investors. Both were authorized to sell mortgage loans as MBSs. As the share of subprime mortgages among all home loans began to increase in the early 2000s (partly because of policy changes designed to boost home ownership among low-income and minority groups), the portfolios of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac became more risky, as their liabilities would be huge should large numbers of mortgage holders default on their loans. Once MBSs created from subprime loans lost value and eventually became toxic, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suffered enormous losses and faced bankruptcy. To prevent their collapse, the U.S. Treasury Department nationalized both corporations in September, replacing their directors and pledging to cover their debts, which then amounted to some $1.6 trillion.\n\nLater that month the 168-year-old investment bank Lehman Brothers, with $639 billion in assets, filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Its failure created lasting turmoil in financial markets worldwide, severely weakened the portfolios of the banks that had loaned it money, and fostered new distrust among banks, leading them to further reduce interbank lending. Although Lehman had tried to find partners or buyers and had hoped for government assistance to facilitate a deal, the Treasury Department refused to intervene, citing \u201cmoral hazard\u201d (in this case, the risk that rescuing Lehman would encourage future reckless behaviour by other banks, which would assume that they could rely on government assistance as a last resort). Only one day later, however, the Fed agreed to loan American International Group (AIG), the country\u2019s largest insurance company, $85 billion to cover losses related to its sale of credit default swaps (CDSs), a financial contract that protects holders of various debt instruments, including MBSs, in the event of default on the underlying loans. Unlike Lehman, AIG was deemed \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d because its collapse would likely cause the failure of many banks that had bought CDSs to insure their purchases of MBSs, which were now worthless. Less than two weeks after Lehman\u2019s demise, Washington Mutual, the country\u2019s largest savings and loan, was seized by federal regulators and sold the next day to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nBy this time there was general agreement among economists and Treasury Department officials that a more forceful government response was necessary to prevent a complete breakdown of the financial system and lasting damage to the U.S. economy. In September the George W. Bush administration proposed legislation, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA), which would establish a Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), under which the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, would be authorized to purchase from U.S. banks up to $700 billion in MBSs and other \u201ctroubled assets.\u201d After the legislation was initially rejected by the House of Representatives, a majority of whose members perceived it as an unfair bailout of Wall Street banks, it was amended and passed in the Senate. As the country\u2019s financial system continued to deteriorate, several representatives changed their minds, and the House passed the legislation on October 3, 2008; President Bush signed it the same day.\n\nIt soon became apparent, however, that the government\u2019s purchase of MBSs would not provide sufficient liquidity in time to avert the failure of several more banks. Paulson was therefore authorized to use up to $250 billion in TARP funds to purchase preferred stock in troubled financial institutions, making the federal government a part-owner of more than 200 banks by the end of the year. The Fed thereafter undertook a variety of extraordinary quantitative-easing (QE) measures, under several overlapping but differently named programs, which were designed to use money created by the Fed to inject liquidity into capital markets and thereby to stimulate economic growth. Similar interventions were undertaken by central banks in other countries. The Fed\u2019s measures included the purchase of long-term U.S. Treasury bonds and MBSs for prime mortgage loans, loan facilities for holders of high-rated securities, and the purchase of MBSs and other debt held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By the time the QE programs were officially ended in 2014, the Fed had by such means pumped more than $4 trillion into the U.S. economy. Despite warnings from some economists that the creation of trillions of dollars of new money would lead to hyperinflation, the U.S. inflation rate remained below the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2 percent through the end of 2014.\n\nThere is now general agreement that the measures taken by the Fed to protect the U.S. financial system and to spur economic growth helped to prevent a global economic catastrophe. In the United States, recovery from the worst effects of the Great Recession was also aided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, a $787 billion stimulus and relief program proposed by the Barack Obama administration and adopted by Congress in February 2009. By the middle of that year, financial markets had begun to revive, and the economy had begun to grow after nearly two years of deep recession. In 2010 Congress adopted the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), which instituted banking regulations to prevent another financial crisis and created a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was charged with regulating, among other things, subprime mortgage loans and other forms of consumer credit. After 2017, however, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act were rolled back or effectively neutered by a Republican-controlled Congress and the Donald J. Trump administration, both of which were hostile to the law\u2019s approach."}, {"url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/casey-serin-the-worlds-most-hated-blogger/", "page_content": "With scant income, assets, or business savvy, the would-be real-estate mogul managed to purchase eight homes in hopes of reselling them at a profit. Along the way, he's lost all of them, run up some $170,000 in credit card and credit line debt, and launched iamfacingforeclosure.com to share his woes with the world. (Editor's note: Serin's site was intermittently reachable Monday.)\n\nFinancial exhibitionism, coupled with a lack of penitence for stiffing his creditors, has transformed the 24-year-old resident of this sleepy Sacramento suburb into a celebrity among fellow bloggers. But unlike other online celebrities, Serin's stardom comes from a unique source: \"haters\" who patronize his blog solely to learn what financial missteps he's made today.\n\n\"A community formed overnight,\" Serin said in an interview. \"It wasn't a very positive community.\"\n\nSince launching his Web site last September, Serin has discovered that it can be profitable to outrage and annoy the thousands of people who visit his blog every day. He estimates he was making up to $1,000 a month through Google ads and believes he's on track to make even more through Yahoo's ad network. His notoriety has led to appearances on Suze Orman's and Robert Kiyosaki's advice shows, and he says he's working on a book and advice packet that he'll sell online.\n\nThrough planning or dumb luck, Serin has managed to capture an audience by severely irritating many disparate groups: those who blame him and fellow speculators for the housing bubble; devout Christians, who urge him to follow the Bible more closely; and others who are hoping for news that his creditors are suing him and that his petite, attractive wife Galina is divorcing him.\n\nSerin makes it all public, including financial spreadsheets and bank statements, frank admissions that he lied on mortgage applications, and, more recently, his marital strife with Galina. Because her husband has refused to get a job since January 2006, the couple has been forced to move in with relatives and Galina cleans houses to pay for their food and rent.\n\nAs a result, the tell-all blog entries have drawn the same kind of highly attentive crowd that might assemble to watch a train wreck in progress. \"I guess I'm an open, kind of exhibitionist personality,\" Serin said.\n\nHis legions of critics use less flattering terms. The HousingPanic blog calls Serin \"the physical representation of fraud, greed, debt, fear, bubbles and human folly.\" Another says Serin is \"slothful, arrogant, unable to plan, unable to make decisions, easily overwhelmed.\"\n\nHating Serin has become something of a sport among bloggers, who compete with each other to post the most biting critiques of his financial missteps. No fewer than four Serin-hating sites have cropped up, and many others poke fun at how he paid tens of thousands of dollars for real-estate investing courses, ran up $2.2 million in debt by buying houses on credit, and then lost most of them to foreclosure (others were sold at a loss, and Serin estimates he owes an additional $100,000 to $250,000 to the banks to cover those losses).\n\nThere's even the sine qua non of a Net-celeb: a Casey Serin Dance Remix mocking his favorite sayings. Doctored photo galleries include images depicting Serin as, alternatively, Gilligan from Gilligan's Island , and McDonald's Hamburglar character. He's already been called a \"national obsession.\"\n\n\"Everyone has an opinion and anyone can speculate,\" said Rob Dawg, who runs a popular anti-Serin Web site called Exurbannation. \"Is he mentally ill? Mentally feeble? Do his bizarre personal habits affect his judgement or vice versa?\" Dawg wrote in e-mail on Friday. \"On and on. For many of us, however, Casey has become the eye of the storm, not the storm itself.\"\n\nSerin has not filed for bankruptcy, though he has publicly mulled the option. For now, he believes himself to be effectively judgment-proof, with his only significant asset being a run-down Volkswagen Jetta that recently was broken into.\n\nReaders who love to hate\n\nThe tension between Serin and his so-called haters has led to an unlikely situation: the very people who loathe him the most also rely on him for a daily source of entertainment.\n\nThe concept is sometimes called \"irritainment,\" defined as: \"Entertainment and media spectacles that are both annoying and compulsively watchable.\" (The O.J. Simpson trial in 1995 is the most famous example. Perez Hilton's blog may be another.)\n\nAgainst their better judgment, some haters have become financial supporters. In March, when Serin was facing a collection agency called CashCall, known for hardball tactics, Serin held a \"beg-a-thon\" trying to raise $220.48 by the next day.\n\nIt worked. Readers paid money to get him to answer personal questions, such as explaining why his wife dropped out of college. Someone even paid Serin $250 for the opportunity to rant to him for an hour about financial responsibility.\n\n\"I was amazed that the so-called haters were willing to spend money on me,\" Serin said. \"It shows that they're not really haters. They're in it for the entertainment.\"\n\nSome are. But others are honestly upset and view Serin as an exemplar of the worst of the housing bubble. Speculators who lied on loans, critics say, raised the cost of housing for honest buyers who needed a place to live, and foreclosures tend to reduce property values of nearby homes.\n\nOne common charge is that by lying on mortgage applications, Serin violated state and federal fraud laws. Serin uses the term \"my mortgage fraud.\" He also admits: \"I overstated my income, misrepresented owner occupancy intent and concealed the cash-back from the lenders.\"\n\nThat frank admission has led to calls to \"Send Casey Serin To Prison\"--a petition to the FBI has appeared--as well as a similar call targeting his wife.\n\n\"Casey and Galina Serin's story isn't one of 'Young couple tries to make it in the cold, cruel world,'\" one critic wrote. \"These two are f****g Bonnie and Clyde. What they're doing is bank robbery, without the gun.\"\n\nStephen Kodak, an FBI spokesman in Washington, said he could not comment on any individual case. \"Yes, it is a crime,\" he said. \"It's a crime to misrepresent your salary. It's a crime to misrepresent whether or not you're going to live in the house.\"\n\nIn March, the FBI announced a crackdown on mortgage scammers and said it has more than 1,000 current investigations. But Kodak said the FBI tends to focus on financial insiders and not people who lie on loans: \"We go after, normally, the fraud for profit, because even though it doesn't make up the majority of the numbers out there, it certainly makes up the largest financial losses.\"\n\nMarital drama, debt addiction\n\nOne wildcard in the Casey Serin saga is his wife, Galina, who met him through church social groups and married him when she was 20 years old. Both are Baptists and Slavic immigrants (Galina immigrated to the U.S. in 1990, and her husband in 1994) and are part of Sacramento's growing Russian-speaking population.\n\nIn a conversation at her sister's townhouse Thursday, where the young couple rents two rooms for about $600 a month, Galina said she was becoming frustrated with her husband's spending and had met with her pastor that afternoon for counseling. But according to her own religious views, Galina said, \"there are only two reasons for a divorce: adultery and physical abuse.\"\n\nRunning up $170,000 in unsecured debt, in other words, does not qualify--nor does lying about his plans regarding a recent vacation in Lake Tahoe, Calif., nor buying a $600 video camera on credit to document life experiences for his blog.\n\nFor his part, Serin confirms that his wife hates his blog. \"Many times she's like: I want you to shut it down and go quietly into the night,\" he said.\n\nThe so-called haters have similar sore points, including that Serin refuses to get a job and instead pays for living expenses by simply borrowing more money. He defends himself by insisting that he's making far more valuable connections through his blog.\n\nOne example he gave is that he learned, through his blog, of a $1.5 billion Las Vegas casino for sale. If he can find a buyer, Serin says, he'd get a 1 percent commission ($15 million) for his trouble. \"Doesn't that make more sense than a W-2 job?\" he said.\n\nSerin also recently paid $16,000 to Arizona's Nouveau Riche University, a kind of real-estate seminar company that includes classes with names like Fix & Flip and Creative Financing. Its marketing literature says that Nouveau Riche \"hand delivers properties on a silver platter.\"\n\nNouveau Riche, which is not accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (the regional group recognized by the U.S. Department of Education), claims not to be a multilevel marketing scheme. It has some elements of one, however. Serin said he has found two people to pay $18,000 to Nouveau Riche, and if he finds any more, he'll get a $9,000 commission for each one, as well as additional commissions if the people he recruited then sign up additional customers.\n\nIn an e-mail message over the weekend, Serin added: \"The 16K gives me two years of quality (real estate investment) education--gives you college credits--access to cash-flow properties around the nation, local community of investors, etc.\"\n\nNot all these details have appeared on his blog yet, but Serin seems to enjoy spacing them out in a way that will vex his readers the most. \"What happens is I feed off of it,\" he said. \"I know the buttons to press to get those guys going. After awhile, you learn what topics you can mention if you want to get extra comments on your post.\"\n\nSerin already does that by stressing his penchant for afternoon naps that take place precisely when his readers are reading his blog in their cubicles and silently fuming. He claims to have bought more than $4,000 in penny stocks last month, which have since slid in value. And he delights in posting about his excursions to a nearby Jamba Juice, which became notorious when he bought a $4.90 drink there with an ATM card but was charged an extra $33 overdraft fee because his bank account was empty.\n\nDuring a visit to the same Jamba Juice on Thursday, Serin asked the cashier whether any jobs were available. But, thinking of how much time he spends every day working on his blog, he added: \"Can I keep my laptop back there while I'm at work?\"\n\nHe left without taking an application.\n\nCNET News.com's Anne Broache contributed to this report"}]}
