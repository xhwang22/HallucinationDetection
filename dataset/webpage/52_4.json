{"Tom Izzo is considered one of the most successful and respected college basketball coaches of all time.": [{"url": "https://msuspartans.com/sports/mens-basketball/roster/coaches/tom-izzo/1011", "page_content": "Tom Izzo was enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2016, cementing his status as one of the game\u2019s all-time greats.\n\n\\\n\nNow in his 28th year, Izzo has compiled an impressive list of accomplishments, including the 2000 NCAA National Championship, 10 regular-season Big Ten Championships, six Big Ten Tournament titles, eight Final Four appearances, eight National Coach of the Year awards and a Big Ten-record 24 straight NCAA Tournament appearances.\n\n\n\nThese accomplishments, however, are not what make Izzo one of the best in the game, but rather it is his insatiable desire to accomplish more.\n\n\n\nWith a career record of 666-267, it\u2019s easy to see that Izzo knows how to win, but he also knows how to win the right way. In his 27 years directing the Spartan program, 85 percent of his players who completed their eligibility also left with a degree. In the last 22 years, 65 Spartans have received their undergraduate degrees.\n\n\n\nIn 27 seasons, Izzo has returned Michigan State to national prominence, placed his name in the NCAA record books and become a leader among college basketball coaches.\n\nIzzo\u2019s 666 wins are fifth most by any coach in his first 27 seasons in the history of college basketball. In late November 2009, he passed his mentor Jud Heathcote (340 wins) to become MSU\u2019s all-time winningest coach. When the Spartans beat Ohio State in the quarterfinals of the 2019 Big Ten Tournament, Izzo won his 600th career game. He became one of just two Big Ten coaches with at least 300 conference wins when MSU beat Iowa, 78-70, on Feb. 25, 2020. And when the Spartans beat Maryland on March 6, 2022, the victory gave Izzo 663 overall wins for his career, passing Bob Knight of Indiana for the most overall wins by a Big Ten Head Coach.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Izzo is at his best, winning at a clip of .697 to rank third among all active coaches with at least 10 tournament games coached. His 53 NCAA Tournament wins are the most ever for a Big Ten coach, and rank sixth all-time. He has led MSU to 24-straight NCAA Tournament appearances, the longest active streak among Division I coaches and tied for the longest streak all-time.\n\n\n\nA 2015 inductee into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame, Izzo led MSU to eight Final Four appearances between 1999 and 2019, becoming just the fourth school in college basketball history to do it in any 21-year span, including just the third since the tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Izzo is one of just two coaches in NCAA history to reach four Final Fours in his first 10 years of coaching, joining Ohio State\u2019s Fred Taylor, and is just the second coach in NCAA history to appear in eight Final Fours in a 21-year span since the tournament expanded to 64 teams. His eight Final Four appearances rank fifth all-time, first among active coaches and first all-time among Big Ten coaches. Two stats stand out in Izzo\u2019s NCAA Tournament success: 1) MSU is 23-7 in the second game of an NCAA Tournament weekend 2) MSU is 15-12 as the lower-seeded team, while the 15 wins are the most in NCAA Tournament history for any coach.\n\n\n\nThrough 27 seasons, Izzo is one of the most successful coaches in Big Ten history. His .679 winning percentage in Big Ten games ranks fourth all-time among league coaches with at least 10 years of service. In all games, Izzo ranks fourth (.714). With 322 conference victories, Izzo ranks second all-time, trailing just Indiana\u2019s Bob Knight (353 wins). In the 2021-22 regular season finale, the Spartans beat Maryland to give Izzo his 663rd win, passing Knight (662) for the most overall wins by a Big Ten Head Coach.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, Izzo brings stability to Michigan State basketball. Including 12 years as an assistant, the 2022-23 season is Izzo\u2019s 40th with the Spartans, as he is the longest serving active Big Ten men\u2019s basketball head coach. He is also a leader among his peers, serving as the NABC President from April 2010-April 2011, while currently serving as an emeritus member of the NABC Board of Directors. He\u2019s also held spots on the John R. Wooden Award Board of Governors and the USA Basketball Collegiate Committee.\n\n\n\nOver the past 25 seasons, Izzo has compiled an impressive 633-239 (.726) record. A quick look at other stats further demonstrates the Spartans\u2019 success over that stretch: 304-134 (.694) in the Big Ten; 349-45 (.886) at the Breslin Center, including a Big Ten record 53-game winning streak; 142-126 (.530) against Top 25 teams (including four wins over No. 1-ranked teams); 87-41 (.680) in postseason play and 53-23 (.697) in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIndividually, players have excelled under Izzo. Twelve Spartans (Charlie Bell, Mateen Cleaves, Paul Davis, Draymond Green, Gary Harris, Drew Neitzel, Adreian Payne, Morris Peterson, Jason Richardson, Denzel Valentine, Miles Bridges and Cassius Winston) have earned some form of All-America honors. Valentine earned six different National Player of the Year awards in 2016 (Associated Press, Basketball Times, NABC, NBC, Sports Illustrated and USA TODAY Sports), and Green was named National Player of the Year by the NABC in 2012. Chris Hill was a three-time Academic All-American, including being named the Academic All-American of the Year in 2005, while Neitzel also earned Academic All-America accolades. In 2019-20, Winston became the third player in MSU history to earn multiple consensus All-American honors, while Xavier Tillman Sr. was named a Second Team Academic All-American.\n\nForty-two different players have earned all-conference recognition, including 14 different first-team honorees, six Big Ten Players of the Year (Cleaves, Green, Lucas, Peterson, Valentine, Winston), three Big Ten Freshmen of the Year (Gary Harris, Miles Bridges and Jaren Jackson Jr.) and three Big Ten Defensive Players of the Year (Travis Walton, Jackson Jr. and Tillman Sr.).\n\n\n\nOne of the reasons for Izzo\u2019s success is his ability to recruit some of the nation\u2019s most talented high school players. During his time as head coach, Izzo has recruited 16 McDonald\u2019s All-Americans (Mateen Cleaves - 1996, Jason Richardson - 1999, Marcus Taylor and Zach Randolph - 2000, Kelvin Torbert - 2001, Paul Davis - 2002, Shannon Brown and Brandon Cotton - 2003, Keith Appling - 2010, Branden Dawson - 2011, Gary Harris - 2012, Deyonta Davis - 2015, Miles Bridges and Joshua Langford - 2016, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 2017, Max Christie - 2021). In addition, 12 of the last 23 Michigan Mr. Basketball award winners suited up for the Green and White (1999 - Richardson, 2000 - Taylor, 2001 - Torbert, 2002 - Davis, 2004 - Drew Neitzel, 2009 - Derrick Nix, 2010 - Appling, 2012 - Matt Costello, 2015 - Davis, 2016 - Cassius Winston, 2018 - Foster Loyer, 2021 \u2013 Pierre Brooks), while Shannon Brown won the 2003 Illinois Mr. Basketball Award and Gary Harris won the 2012 Indiana Mr. Basketball Award.\n\n\n\nBut perhaps even more important to Izzo\u2019s success is his ability to take young talent and develop a player\u2019s skills, allowing him to grow as a player and go on to play professionally. Under Izzo, Michigan State has had 23 players selected in the NBA Draft, including 22 since 2000, 11 of whom were first rounders (Mateen Cleaves - 2000 first round, Morris Peterson - 2000 first round, Jason Richardson - 2001 first round, Zach Randolph - 2001 first round, Andre Hutson - 2001 second round, Marcus Taylor - 2002 second round, Erazem Lorbek - 2005 second round, Shannon Brown - 2006 first round, Maurice Ager - 2006 first round, Paul Davis - 2006 second round, Goran Suton - 2009 second round, Draymond Green - 2012 second round, Adreian Payne - 2014 first round, Gary Harris - 2014 first round, Branden Dawson - 2015 second round, Denzel Valentine - 2016 first round, Deyonta Davis - 2016 second round, Jaren Jackson Jr. - 2018 first round, Miles Bridges - 2018 first round, Xavier Tillman Sr. - 2020 second round, Cassius Winston - 2020 second round, Max Christie \u2013 2022 second round).\n\nWhile many players were high school All-Americans, Izzo took others who were not ranked in the top-75 coming out of high school and turned them into NBA talent. In addition, Izzo-recruit Charlie Bell played in the NBA during the 2001-02 season after signing a free agent contract. After a successful stint overseas, Bell played seven more seasons in the NBA. Alan Anderson, a member of the 2005 Final Four team, signed a free agent contract and played two years with the Charlotte Bobcats and, after a stint in Europe, returned for five seasons back in the NBA. In more recent years, Kalin Lucas and Bryn Forbes have also played in the NBA after signing free agent contracts, while Aaron Henry signed a two-way contract with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2021. Numerous other former Spartans have enjoyed lucrative professional careers playing overseas.\n\n\n\nIzzo has also emerged as a teacher, not only to his players, but also his assistant coaches. Three current Division I head coaches served as assistants to Izzo, including Brian Gregory (South Florida), Stan Heath (Eastern Michigan) and Dwayne Stephens (Western Michigan). In total, eight former assistants have earned head coaching jobs. Former long-time assistant Mike Garland spent three seasons as head coach at Cleveland State following an initial seven-year stint at MSU, while Stan Joplin was also head coach at Toledo for 12 seasons, Jim Boylen served as head coach at Utah for four seasons, Heath served as head coach at Kent State, Arkansas and South Florida over 13 seasons and Tom Crean was the head coach at Marquette, Indiana and Georgia. The current coaching staff features two former assistants who were head coaches before returning to East Lansing \u2013 Doug Wojcik spent nine seasons between Tulsa and College of Charleston and Mark Montgomery was the head coach at Northern Illinois for 10 seasons.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans finished the 2021-22 season with a 23-13 overall record and were selected to the NCAA Tournament for the 24th-straight season, extending the longest streak in Big Ten history. The 24-year run also ranked tied for the third-longest in NCAA history and was the second-longest active streak in the nation. Izzo tied former Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski for the most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances and entered the 2022-23 season as the active leader for consecutive appearances.\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished the 2020-21 season with a 15-13 overall record and advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the 23rd-straight season, the longest streak in Big Ten history and the third-longest active streak among Division I schools. In a season shortened to just 28 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spartans opened the season with six-straight non-league wins, including a 75-69 win at Duke in the Champions Classic. After starting the Big Ten Conference season with three-straight losses and a 2-7 record through nine games, MSU finished the season with a 7-4 mark against Big Ten opponents and closed out the regular season with five wins in its last seven games, including wins against No. 5 Illinois, No. 4 Ohio State and No. 2 Michigan.\n\n\n\nThe 2019-20 season finished with Michigan State clinching a share of the Big Ten regular season title for the third-straight year. The Spartans won their last five regular season games and six of the last seven overall, to finish 14-6 and claim a share of the title. While the postseason was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, MSU finished the season with a 22-9 overall record and a 14-6 record in league play. The Spartans opened the season ranked No. 1 in the country in the Associated Press pre-season poll, the first time in program history the team was the top-ranked team in the preseason. MSU finished the season ranked second in the country in assists per game (17.7), while also ranked fourth in field goal percentage defense (37.9 percent) and ninth in total rebounds per game (40.6). Of the 28 20-win seasons in Michigan State history, Izzo has been involved in 25 of them, 20 as a head coach and five as an assistant.\n\n\n\nThe 2018-19 season was among the most memorable in Michigan State history under Izzo. The Spartans finished with a 32-7 overall record, the fifth 30-win season under Izzo, won a share of the Big Ten regular season championship, won the Big Ten Tournament Championship for a conference-record sixth time and reached the Final Four for the eighth time in 21 years and the 10th time in program history. Along the way, MSU won the Las Vegas Invitational, beat Michigan three times, including a 65-60 decision in the Big Ten Tournament Championship, and toppled No. 1 Duke, 68-67, in the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. MSU finished the year leading the nation in total rebounds (1,580) and total assists (715), while ranking among the top-10 in the country in six other categories: assists per game (3rd, 18.3 apg), total blocks (3rd, 205), field goal percentage defense (3rd, 38.1%), rebound margin (5th, 8.8 rpg), defensive rebounds per game (6th, 29.72 rpg) and blocked shots per game (7th, 5.3 bpg).\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished the 2017-18 season with a 30-5 overall record, the fourth 30-win season under Izzo, advanced to the NCAA Tournament for a Big Ten-record 21st straight season and won the program\u2019s eighth Big Ten regular season championship. The Spartans set a school record for most wins in a regular season (28), won their first outright Big Ten Regular Season title since 2009, won 16 Big Ten Conference games for the first time and had the fewest losses in a regular season since the 2000-01 team went 24-3. The New Year started with MSU moving into the No. 1 spot in the national rankings for the fifth time in program history, and the fourth time under Izzo. The Spartans had win streaks of 14 games and 13 games during the season, earning a No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. MSU finished the year leading the nation in assists per game (19.1), blocked shots per game (7.2), field goal percentage defense (36.7%) and rebound margin (+10.7).\n\n\n\nThe 2016-17 season saw Michigan State advance to the NCAA Tournament for a Big Ten-record 20th straight season. It was not an easy road, however, to reach the postseason. Before the season started, the Spartans lost senior forwards Ben Carter and Gavin Schilling to season-ending knee injuries. MSU\u2019s November was arguably the toughest opening month in college basketball history. In addition to games against four ranked opponents, all away from home, the Spartans traveled more than 13,600 miles in 22 days with trips to Hawaii, New York, North Carolina and the Bahamas. In December, the Spartans played seven contests without leading scorer Miles Bridges. Despite all the adversity, including losing a third player, Eron Harris, to a season-ending knee injury in February, the Spartans pulled together and used a 5-2 mark in February to earn their way into the NCAA Tournament. When MSU defeated Miami in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Spartans secured their 20th win of the season. It was quite an accomplishment for a team that was one of the least experienced (321st) and shortest (291st) in the nation according to KenPom.com.\n\n\n\nThe 2015-16 season was a milestone year both for Coach Izzo and the Spartans. Michigan State opened the year by winning its first 13 games, establishing a new school mark for best start to a season. When the Spartans defeated Boston College on November 26, Izzo became the 91st coach in NCAA history to record 500 career wins, with at least 10 seasons in Division I, and just the eighth coach to accomplish the feat in his first 21 seasons. He also became just the 18th coach to win 500 career games in his first collegiate head-coaching stop, and was the eighth-fastest coach to reach 500 wins among those who did it all at one school, accomplishing the feat in 699 games.\n\n\n\nOn December 7, MSU rose to No. 1 in the regular-season polls for just the fourth time in school history, and the third time under Izzo. The Spartans would hold the top spot for a school-record four weeks. Following a perfect 13-0 non-conference slate, Michigan State would finish second in the Big Ten with a 13-5 mark. A victory over Northwestern gave Izzo 513 for his career, moving past Purdue\u2019s Gene Keady for second-most wins at a Big Ten School, trailing only Bob Knight (662). In the Big Ten Tournament, the Spartans defeated Ohio State, Maryland and Purdue to become the first school in Big Ten history to hold five conference tournament titles. The Spartans earned a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they were upset by No. 15 Middle Tennessee. MSU finished the season with a 29-6 record, matching the fourth-best win total in school history, as the Spartans\u2019 26 regular-season victories equaled a school record. Izzo\u2019s Spartans were the only team in the nation to win 27 or more games every year from 2011-12 to 2015-16.\n\n\n\nStatistically, the 2015-16 season was one of the most impressive in school history. Michigan State led the nation in 3-point field-goal percentage (.434), rebound margin (+11.4), assists per game (20.5) and total assists (719). The Spartans ranked in the top three in eight different categories, and in the Top 10 in 11 different categories. It marked the fifth time in Izzo\u2019s career that the Spartans led the nation in rebounding margin. MSU also set school single-season records for assists (719), 3-point field goals made (321) and blocked shots (177). The 719 assists were the 22nd-best total in NCAA history, while MSU recorded an assist on a nation\u2019s-best 71.3 percent of its field goals. At 79.8 points per game, the 2015-16 squad was the highest-scoring team of the Izzo era, and the highest-scoring team since 1985-86. In Big Ten Conference games, MSU led the conference in 12 stat categories and was ranked in the top three in 17 of the 21 stats.\n\n\n\nThe 2014-15 Spartans provided a lesson in resiliency and the power of togetherness. MSU opened the season ranked in the polls, but by Christmas, the Spartans had fallen out of the rankings. Following a home loss to Illinois on Feb. 7, the Spartans stood at 15-8, including just 6-4 in conference. MSU closed the regular season by winning six of its last eight games, including a final week that featured a come-from-behind home finale win over Purdue on Senior Day despite a first-half injury to Branden Dawson, and a regular-season finale victory at Indiana without Dawson. In the Big Ten Tournament, MSU defeated Ohio State and No. 8 Maryland before falling to No. 6 Wisconsin in overtime. The Spartans were disappointed to have let a championship opportunity slip away, but entered the NCAA Tournament on a mission.\n\n\n\nHaving entered March just hoping to secure a spot in the NCAA Tournament, the postseason run turned a good season into a great one. As the No. 7 seed, MSU opened with a victory over No. 10 Georgia. In the third round, MSU faced No. 2 Virginia for the second-straight season, defeating the Cavaliers to advance to a nation\u2019s-best seventh Sweet 16 in the last eight seasons. At the East Regional in Syracuse, the Spartans trailed at the half against both No. 3 Oklahoma in the Sweet 16 and No. 4 Louisville in the Elite Eight, before rallying for a pair of victories to reach the Final Four. Making its nation\u2019s-best seventh Final Four appearance in the last 17 seasons, MSU got off to a quick start against No. 1 Duke before falling to the eventual National Champion Blue Devils. MSU would finish 27-12, 12-6 in the Big Ten.\n\n\n\nThe senior class of 2015 finished tied for the second-winningest class in school history with 112 wins. The 2014-15 Spartans established school single-season records for assists (646) and blocks (176), while the 294 made 3-pointers were second-most in school history. Averaging 16.6 assists per game, the Spartans ranked fifth in the nation, while ranking seventh in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.5). Defensively, MSU posted a .396 field-goal percentage defense, marking the fourth-straight season that Spartan opponents shot less than 40 percent from the field.\n\n\n\nThe 2013-14 season was not short of highlights. It started early, with No. 2 MSU knocking off No. 1 Kentucky, 78-74, on Nov. 12 in Chicago, in what was the earliest game ever between No. 1 and No. 2. One week later, MSU ascended to No. 1 in the polls, a position it would hold for three weeks \u2013 establishing a school record at the time for the longest stay at No. 1. In late November, the Spartans captured the Coaches Vs. Cancer Tournament title in Brooklyn, marking MSU\u2019s first regular-season, neutral-site tournament championship since December 1998.\n\n\n\nInjuries proved to be a common storyline during the 2013-14 campaign, as six different players, including each one of MSU\u2019s top four scorers, missed multiple games due to injury or illness for a total of 29 games missed. In 19 of 38 games, including 13 of 18 Big Ten contests, the Spartans were without their full allotment of players due to injury. In nine games, Michigan State was without two of its regular rotation players. In total, 11 different Spartans started at least one game, as Izzo employed 15 different starting lineups. The fluctuation led to inconsistent results through much of the Big Ten slate, but by the end of the regular season, MSU was getting healthy.\n\n\n\nPlaying at full strength, the Spartans played at a different level in the postseason, steamrolling through the Big Ten Tournament. The championship game featured the third meeting of the season between in-state rivals Michigan State and Michigan, marking the first time the Spartans and Wolverines would meet in the conference tournament. Although UM won the two regular-season meetings, this was the first time MSU would feature a complete roster, pulling away early in the second half to capture the fourth tournament championship in school history with a 69-55 victory.\n\n\n\nMSU entered the NCAA Tournament as the No. 4 seed in the East Region, but was also a popular pick to advance to the Final Four and even cut down the championship nets. In the second round, Adreian Payne scored an MSU NCAA Tournament record 41 points to defeat Delaware, 93-78. Two days later, the Spartans advanced to the Sweet 16 with an 80-73 win over Harvard. Playing in the East Regional in New York City\u2019s Madison Square Garden, Michigan State defeated No. 1 seed Virginia, 61-59. In the Elite Eight, the Spartans held a nine-point lead in the second half against Connecticut, but the eventual National Champion Huskies would rally for a 60-54 victory.\n\n\n\nThe 2013-14 Spartans finished with a 29-9 record, including 12-6 in the Big Ten, finishing tied for second. The 29 wins tied for the fourth-best total in school history, while MSU established single-season school records for assists (637), made 3-point field goals (307), and blocks (174). Michigan State led the conference in field-goal percentage defense (.397), while ranking second in field-goal percentage (.474) and 3-point field-goal percentage (.392). The Spartans also finished with an all-time low 11.6 turnovers per contest.\n\n\n\nIn 2012-13, the Spartans collected a 27-9 record, including 13-5 in the Big Ten, against perhaps the nation\u2019s most difficult schedule, playing 13 games against ranked opponents. The slate was especially difficult down the stretch as 14 of MSU\u2019s last 18 games (postseason included) were against opponents that participated in the NCAA Tournament. Michigan State advanced to its 16th consecutive NCAA Tournament as the No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region, and advanced to the Sweet 16 for the fifth time in the last six seasons, tied for the most in the nation.\n\n\n\nOn Jan. 16, 2013, Izzo recorded his 200th conference victory against Penn State, joining Mike Krzyzewski (Duke) and Jim Boeheim (Syracuse) as the only active coaches in a power conference with 200 conference wins at their current school. In April, Izzo received the Wayman Tisdale Humanitarian Award, honoring an individual in college basketball who has made a significant impact on society.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans proved to be dominant defensively once again in 2012-13, pacing the Big Ten in field-goal percentage defense (.390) and steals (8.0 spg), while ranking second in scoring defense (59.1 ppg) and third in 3-point field-goal percentage defense (.300). MSU also continued to be strong on the glass, ranking second in the Big Ten and 10th in the nation with a +7.6 rebound margin, marking the 11th time that an Izzo-coached team ranked in the Top 10 in the nation.\n\n\n\nThe 2011-12 season was one of Izzo\u2019s most rewarding as head coach. The Spartans entered the season unranked, returning only two players who averaged more than 20 minutes a game the previous season. MSU opened the year with neutral-site losses to No. 1 North Carolina and No. 6 Duke, but responded with 15 straight victories, including road wins at No. 23 Gonzaga and No. 18 Wisconsin, marking the Spartans\u2019 first win in Madison since 2001. Keyed by a mid-February win at No. 3 Ohio State, MSU would go on to capture a share of the Big Ten regular-season championship, the seventh of the Izzo era, and head to the Big Ten Tournament where it defeated Ohio State to capture the third Big Ten Tournament title in school history, and the first since 2000. Michigan State was rewarded with a No. 1 seed in the West Region of the NCAA Tournament, where it would advance to the Sweet 16 for the 10th time in the last 15 years, good for second most in the nation. MSU would finish with a 29-8 record.\n\n\n\nStatistically, the Spartans finished the 2011-12 season ranked second in the nation in field-goal percentage defense (.379), the best effort by a Spartan squad since 1959. Once again, the Spartans were a dominant presence on the glass, ranking fifth in the nation in rebounding margin (+8.0), and pacing the Big Ten for the 12th time in the last 15 seasons, and the 13th time in his career.\n\n\n\nFor his efforts, Izzo was named the 2012 Big Ten Coach of the Year by both the league\u2019s media and coaches. He also was named Division I National Coach of the Year by the NABC, and was CBSSports.com\u2019s pick for national coach of the year as well.\n\n\n\nThe 2010-11 Spartans finished with a 19-15 mark and advanced to a 14th-straight NCAA Tournament. MSU faced a difficult regular-season schedule that included 18 of 33 games against the RPI Top 50 and 23 of 33 against the RPI Top 100.\n\n\n\nMichigan State turned in another great season in 2009-10, capturing a share of a second-straight Big Ten Championship and advancing to a sixth Final Four in 12 seasons. With MSU\u2019s 106-68 victory over UMass in the sixth game of the season, Izzo recorded his 341st victory, becoming Michigan State\u2019s all-time winningest coach. The Spartans opened Big Ten play with a school-best 9-0 start and captured a share of the regular-season crown with a 14-4 mark. Overall, MSU would finish with a 28-9 record.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans opened the 2010 NCAA Tournament as a No. 5 seed and advanced through the first weekend with narrow victories over New Mexico State (70-67) and Maryland (85-83). In the Midwest Regional, the Spartans won two more close games, defeating Northern Iowa (59-52) and Tennessee (70-69) to advance to the program\u2019s eighth Final Four and the sixth in the last 12 seasons under Izzo. Michigan State led the nation in rebounding margin for the fourth time in Izzo\u2019s career, out-rebounding opponents by a +8.6 margin.\n\n\n\nThe 2008-09 season was one of the best in the history of Spartan basketball. Michigan State advanced to its fifth Final Four in 11 seasons, becoming just the fifth school in the history of college basketball to accomplish that feat. During the regular season, the Spartans won the Big Ten Championship with a 15-3 league record, including a school-best 8-1 mark on the road. MSU won the league title by four games, equaling the second-greatest margin in conference history. Overall, Michigan State finished the season with a 31-7 record, the third-highest win total in school history. For his efforts, Izzo was named Big Ten Coach of the Year for the second time in his career.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, Michigan State advanced through the first weekend with wins over Robert Morris and USC. In the Sweet 16, the Spartans took out defending National Champion Kansas. In the Elite Eight, MSU beat No. 1 seed and No. 1 ranked Louisville, marking just the third victory over the top-ranked team in The Associated Press Top 25 in school history. At the Final Four in Detroit\u2019s Ford Field, the Spartans beat No. 1 seed Connecticut before eventually falling to North Carolina in the title game.\n\n\n\nMichigan State led the nation in rebounding margin for the third time in Izzo\u2019s career, out-rebounding opponents by a +9.3 margin. It marked the eighth time that an Izzo-coached team ranked in the top 10 in the nation. The Spartans also proved to possess a high-powered attack, leading the Big Ten in scoring offense (72.0 ppg).\n\n\n\nIzzo directed Michigan State to a 27-9 record in 2007-08. The season finished with a trip to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament, marking MSU\u2019s seventh trip to the regionals in the last 11 years. The 27 wins marked the fifth-largest total in school history at the time, while the 24 regular-season victories were the then third-largest regular-season total for MSU. The Spartans were a perfect 17-0 at home, good for the first perfect home season since 2001 and the fourth in Breslin Center history.\n\n\n\nThe 2007-08 Spartans led the Big Ten in rebounding margin (+6.8). In league games, MSU paced the conference in field-goal percentage (.474) for the fifth-straight season, becoming the first school in league history to accomplish that feat.\n\n\n\nMichigan State finished with a 23-12 mark in 2006-07. The Spartans had to overcome a large amount of adversity and a very difficult Big Ten schedule to advance to a 10th-straight NCAA Tournament. The Spartans also did something for the first time in school history \u2013 recording Michigan State\u2019s first home win over a No. 1-ranked team, with a 64-55 decision over Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nThe 2006-07 Spartans excelled by getting back to basics \u2013 rebounding and defense. On the glass, the Spartans led the Big Ten in rebounding margin (+7.0). Defensively, MSU allowed opponents just 57.2 points per game, the lowest total since the 1951-52 squad allowed 56.0 points. Opponents also shot just 38.4 percent from the field, the lowest percentage since 1958-59 (.379). Nationally, the Spartans ranked sixth in scoring defense and field-goal percentage defense and eighth in rebounding margin.\n\n\n\nIn 2005-06, Michigan State finished with a 22-12 mark. The Spartans played one of the nation\u2019s toughest schedules, playing more games against teams ranked in the RPI top-25 (13) and top-50 (18) than any other school. In Big Ten games, MSU led the conference in five stat categories including free-throw percentage (.781), field-goal percentage (.469), rebounding defense (30.1), rebounding margin (+4.2) and assists (15.81 apg).\n\n\n\nMichigan State returned to the Final Four in 2005, becoming the only team to appear in four Final Fours between 1999 and 2005. The Spartans finished the season with a 26-7 mark, including 22-5 in the regular season. Since joining the Big Ten, only three Spartan teams finished the regular season with fewer losses.\n\n\n\nIn the NCAA Tournament, MSU defeated No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Kentucky in the Austin Regional, becoming the first team in tournament history to defeat the Blue Devils and the Wildcats in the same year. Despite losing to North Carolina in the Final Four, Izzo was named the 2005 Clair Bee Award winner, recognizing the Division I men\u2019s basketball coach who has made the most significant positive contribution to his sport.\n\n\n\nNot only did the 2004-05 Spartans win, they were also statistically impressive, ranking in the top 15 nationally in six statistical categories, including free-throw percentage (3rd, .777), scoring margin (7th, +13.1), assists per game (10th, 17.1 apg), field-goal percentage (11th, .487), rebound margin (11th, +6.8) and scoring offense (13th, 78.5 ppg). MSU led the Big Ten in scoring for the second-straight year with 78.5 points per game \u2013 its highest scoring average since 1985-86 (83.1 ppg).\n\n\n\nDuring the season, Izzo recorded his 232nd win at MSU, moving past Benjamin Van Alstyne for the second most number of career wins in Spartan coaching history. In the summer of 2005, Izzo traveled to Kuwait to take part in \u201cOperation Hardwood - Hoops With The Troops.\u201d Izzo was one of eight coaches and sports personalities coaching 13-member military basketball teams on Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, from Aug. 27-31. Camp Arifjan defeated the other bases to win the championship under the direction of Coach Izzo. Izzo made a return trip to Kuwait in May 2006.\n\n\n\nIn 2003-04, MSU opened the season with a 5-7 mark after taking on one of the most difficult non-conference schedules in NCAA history. Rather than give up, Izzo and the Spartans rallied to win 12 of the next 15 games, finishing just one game out of first place in the Big Ten at 12-4. For the year, MSU posted an 18-12 mark. Michigan State became the first team in Big Ten history to lead the conference in scoring offense (71.3 ppg), field-goal percentage (.522), 3-point field-goal percentage (.434) and free-throw percentage (.777) in the same season.\n\n\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2004, MSU defeated Iowa, 89-72, as Izzo recorded the 200th victory of his Spartan career, becoming just the third coach in MSU history to accomplish that feat. He also became the eighth head coach in NCAA history to record 200 wins in his first nine seasons. Ten days later, Izzo became just the third coach in Big Ten history to record 100 league wins in his first nine seasons, joining Bob Knight and Gene Keady as MSU defeated Minnesota, 69-58, on Feb. 14.\n\n\n\nThe 2002-03 season was a study in perseverance. Izzo rallied his team to win the final four regular-season games and eight of the last 10 conference games to finish 10-6 in the Big Ten, good for third place in the league. Michigan State made even bigger noise during the NCAA Tournament. The No. 7 seed Spartans easily dismissed Colorado in the first round, setting up a matchup with the No. 2 seed Florida Gators. The Spartans shocked many experts with a 68-46 victory in the Gators\u2019 home state. In the Sweet 16, MSU defeated defending national champion Maryland in a thrilling two-point game, before eventually falling to the No. 1 seed Texas Longhorns in the Lone Star State.\n\n\n\nThe Elite Eight appearance was the fourth for MSU between 1999 and 2003. During that time period, no other school made more than two trips. In fact, since the NCAA Tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, just six programs (Duke, Florida, Kentucky, Michigan State, North Carolina and UNLV) have advanced to four Elite Eights in any five-year period.\n\nThe 2001-02 season may prove to be one of Izzo\u2019s finest. Despite losing 81 percent of the scoring load from 2000-01, and having three key players miss several games with injuries, Izzo led the Spartans to a 10-6 Big Ten mark (19-12 overall), finishing just one game out of first place. MSU won 10 of the last 13 regular-season games and earned a spot in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\n\nIn 2000-01, Izzo earned NABC National Coach of the Year and District 11 Coach of the Year honors for leading MSU to its third straight Final Four and fourth straight regular-season Big Ten Championship. MSU became just the fourth school in Big Ten history to win four-straight league titles.\n\n\n\nMSU opened the season by winning its first 12 games to establish the best start in school history. On Dec. 25, 2000, the Spartans earned the top spot in The Associated Press Top 25, marking the first time they held the No. 1 position in the AP Poll since 1979. In Big Ten action, Michigan State posted a 13-3 record to win a share of the league crown. The Big Ten finale vs. Michigan marked Izzo\u2019s 100th Big Ten game. Through his first 100 games, Izzo posted a 72-28 mark, the fifth-best record in Big Ten history.\n\n\n\nIn the 2001 NCAA Tournament, Izzo guided the Spartans to a third-straight Final Four. For a third consecutive season, Michigan State earned a No. 1 seed. MSU won the first three games by double figures, establishing a record with nine straight NCAA Tournament victories by double digits. When MSU defeated Temple, 69-62, in the South Regional Final, the Spartans became just the ninth school to reach three-straight Final Fours and just the third since the NCAA Tournament field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. On the season, MSU finished with a 28-5 record.\n\n\n\nMichigan State led the nation in rebound margin for the second straight season at +15.4 boards per game, tying the fifth-largest margin in Division I history (greatest since 1980). The Spartans also ranked 13th in the nation in scoring defense (61.8 ppg).\n\n\n\nIn 1999-2000, Michigan State captured the second NCAA Championship in school history and its third straight regular season Big Ten Championship. MSU also won at least 30 games for the second straight season, posting a 32-7 mark, becoming just the second Big Ten school to accomplish that feat. The 65 wins over the 1998-99 and 1999-2000 seasons were the greatest two-year total in the history of the Big Ten. MSU also repeated as Big Ten Tournament champions.\n\n\n\nIzzo led MSU to consecutive Final Fours for the first time in school history. For his efforts, Izzo was named USBWA District V Coach of the Year and NABC District 11 Coach of the Year. Izzo also recorded his 100th career victory in a Jan. 11, 2000, 77-71 overtime win over Indiana in the Breslin Center.\n\n\n\nFor the second consecutive season, Michigan State earned a No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region of the NCAA Tournament. After disposing of Valparaiso and Utah in Cleveland, the Spartans moved on to the Sweet 16 at the Palace of Auburn Hills, where they recorded come-from-behind victories versus Syracuse and Iowa State. In the Final Four, MSU defeated Wisconsin for the fourth time that season. The Spartans then captured their second NCAA title in school history, defeating Florida, 89-76.\n\n\n\nIn 1998-99, Izzo directed the Spartans on a magical run to the program\u2019s first appearance in the NCAA Final Four since 1979. Michigan State posted a record of 33-5, establishing a school record for most wins in a season. For his efforts, Izzo was named the Basketball Times National Coach of the Year and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District 11 Coach of the Year. Throughout the Big Ten season, Michigan State established itself as the class program of the conference. Izzo directed the school to its second-straight Big Ten title. The Spartans followed up a 15-1 Big Ten regular season by capturing their first Big Ten Tournament championship. The 15 league wins tied a school record for most victories in conference play, while the Spartans\u2019 93.8 winning percentage established a school record.\n\n\n\nWhereas MSU\u2019s success in 1998-99 was expected, the Spartans took the college basketball world by storm in 1997-98. Izzo became the first MSU coach to earn Associated Press National Coach of the Year honors, leading MSU to a 22-8 record and a share of the Big Ten title. The Spartans posted a 13-3 mark in conference, earning Izzo Big Ten Coach of the Year honors.\n\n\n\nOver the course of the 1997-98 season, Izzo and his team finished the year ranked No. 10 nationally by USA Today/ESPN, marking the first time the Spartans had finished in the Top 10 since 1995. In addition to his AP award, Izzo was named National Coach of the Year by Basketball News and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA). Basketball Times selected Izzo as its Mideast Coach of the Year.\n\n\n\nDuring Izzo\u2019s first season as head coach in 1995-96, he directed the Green and White to an overall slate of 16-16, including 9-9 in the Big Ten. Izzo recorded four wins over Top 25 teams. In 1996-97, Izzo guided the Green and White cagers to an overall mark of 17-12, including a Big Ten ledger of 9-9. Izzo led the Spartans to the second round of the NIT in each of his first two seasons.\n\n\n\nIn his 40th season as a member of the MSU coaching staff, Izzo has been with the Spartan program since taking a part-time assistant coaching position in 1983. An assistant coach with the Spartans from 1983-86, Izzo left MSU in May of 1986 to become the top assistant and recruiting coordinator at Tulsa. But, on June 10 of the same year, Izzo returned to East Lansing when Spartan assistant Mike Deane left to become head coach at Siena College.\n\n\n\nKnown as a tireless worker both on the recruiting trail and in the office, his hard work and loyalty were rewarded in July 1990, when Jud Heathcote appointed him associate head coach. His dutiful efforts were further recognized when, on March 30, 1993, then-MSU Athletics Director Merrily Dean Baker recommended both a one-year contract extension for Heathcote through the 1994-95 season and that Izzo be appointed head coach upon Jud\u2019s retirement. The MSU Board of Trustees accepted both recommendations on April 9, 1994.\n\nIzzo originally came to MSU from Northern Michigan, where he had been an assistant from 1979-83. He was named a part-time assistant at MSU in September 1983. When former assistant Edgar Wilson left in November 1983, Izzo became a full-time assistant.\n\n\n\nIzzo played guard for NMU\u2019s basketball team from 1973-77, and was voted the team\u2019s MVP as a senior. He was also a third-team Division II All-America pick that year and established the Wildcat record for most minutes played in a season. Following his graduation from NMU in 1977, Izzo took over as head coach at Ishpeming High School and served in that position for the 1977-78 campaign.\n\n\n\nA native of Iron Mountain, Michigan, Izzo and former NFL head coach Steve Mariucci were Iron Mountain High School teammates in football, basketball, baseball and track. As college roommates at Northern Michigan, Izzo walked on to the basketball team, while Mariucci did the same with football. Both would go on to earn Division II All-America honors. Despite their busy schedules, they remain the closest of friends. For 10 years, they co-hosted a golf tournament in Iron Mountain to raise money for the community, including a fitness center for the high school.\n\n\n\nIn 1990, Izzo was inducted into the Northern Michigan University Hall of Fame and was selected as an inductee into the Upper Peninsula Hall of Fame during the summer of 1998. He was inducted into the National Italian-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2011, and the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2015. He received the sport\u2019s ultimate honor when his election into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was announced on April 4, 2016. He was officially enshrined in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Sept. 9, 2016.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Izzo received honorary degrees from both Northern Michigan and Michigan State, delivering the commencement address at both graduation ceremonies.\n\n\n\nIzzo is also an active volunteer in the community. Among his many efforts, he is very active with Coaches Vs. Cancer, Volunteers of America and Sparrow Hospital. In 2009, Izzo was presented the Coaches Vs. Cancer Champion Award, recognizing his work and leadership in the fight to save lives from cancer.\n\n\n\nIzzo and his wife, Lupe, created the Izzo Legacy Fund in 2019 to formalize their commitment to the Mid-Michigan community. The Izzo Legacy Fund helps to raise money and contributions to charitable causes in the area.\n\n\n\nIzzo was born Jan. 30, 1955. His family includes his wife, Lupe, daughter, Raquel, and son, Steven.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://spartanswire.usatoday.com/2020/06/12/tom-izzo-named-one-of-the-most-influential-people-in-college-basketball/", "page_content": "Tom Izzo has been named of the 100 most influential people in college basketball by Silver Waves Media.\n\nThe list is comprised of college coaches, conference commissioners, and other people impacting the college basketball world. According to Silver Waves, to be considered for the list a candidate must either win at a high level, produce top-flight talent, effect movement int he college coaching carousel, or have his or her fingerprints all over the sport.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that Izzo qualifies for any one of those categories. While the listing is ranked alphabetically instead of numerically, it\u2019s safe to assume Izzo is going to find himself near the top of any type of list measuring influence in college hoops.\n\nOf Izzo Silver Waves, writes, \u201d You can never count the Spartans out under Tom Izzo. The Naismith Hall of Famer has a winning clip of .706 in the month of March, which ranks fourth among all active coaches with at least ten tournament games coached. His 52 NCAA Tournament wins are the most ever for a Big Ten coach, and rank sixth all-time. The winningest coach in Michigan State history has led his Spartans to seven Final Four appearances between 1999 and 2015, making the program just one of four to ever accomplish such a feat in a 17-year span. His seven Final Four appearances rank fifth all-time, third among active coaches and first all-time among Big Ten coaches. He has always been atop the Big Ten with his teams too. His .696 winning percentage in Big Ten games ranks third all-time among league coaches with at least 10 years of service. With 288 conference victories, Izzo ranks second all-time, trailing just Indiana\u2019s Bob Knight (353 wins), while also ranking second for most wins at a Big Ten institution (606), trailing just Knight (662). The legendary success has kept multiple eyes of decision makers on the program. Former assistants Jim Boylen, Tom Crean, Tim Buckley, Darrin Horn, Tod Kowalczyk, Buzz Williams, Brian Gregory, Stan Heath, Stan Joplin, Doug Wojcik, Mark Montgomery have all been picked by athletic directors at some point during their career to be a head coach and make up his coaching tree. Additionally, 20 Michigan State players like Jaren Jackson, Miles Bridges, Gary Harris, and Zach Randolph have all been selected by NBA general managers.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/3168455/2022/03/07/tom-izzo-at-win-no-663-remains-a-magnetic-force-in-college-basketball-and-especially-in-the-big-ten/", "page_content": "EAST LANSING, Mich. \u2014 As his team gathered in front of the scorer\u2019s table \u2014 still in uniform, staring up at the video board for a montage commemorating the milestone \u2014 Tom Izzo made the rounds. There was reason to celebrate.\n\nHe embraced his two college roommates and longtime friends, Jerry Rosburg and Steve Mariucci, in attendance to witness history. He hugged his wife, Lupe, and his son Steven, a walk-on basketball player for the program his father has been the face of for 27 years. When the video concluded, Izzo walked to midcourt, mouthing to a nearby staffer, Where\u2019s the mic? Where\u2019s the mic?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe had something to say, and everyone around him was ready to listen.\n\n\u201cI want to thank all of you,\u201c Izzo said to the crowd of 14,797 that remained for the senior day festivities and to celebrate a new milestone for Izzo. \u201cWhen you look at how you\u2019ve been for all these years \u2014 I mean, 27 years you\u2019ve had to put up with me. Twenty-seven years. That\u2019s a long time.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it is. Speaking to the crowd Sunday, Izzo joked about taking over during a time when a 20-win season meant it was time to plan a parade. That was 1995, back when Izzo was a 40-year-old head coach taking over his mentor\u2019s program. He notched his first win as Michigan State\u2019s head coach that year, 69-66 over Chaminade in the Maui Invitational. No one knew where this thing would end up. But 27 years later, Izzo is still here, pacing the sidelines, now with 663 wins to his name.\n\nWith Sunday\u2019s 77-67 victory over Maryland, Izzo surpassed Bob Knight as the Big Ten\u2019s all-time winningest coach.\n\nIn Year 27, Izzo remains a magnetic force in college basketball at-large but even more so in this conference. During his path to 663 wins this season, Izzo\u2019s peers in the Big Ten and beyond have often gone out of their way to acknowledge his accomplishments in the conference.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s because others from his era have stepped down in recent years, causing Izzo\u2019s colleagues to make comments like this while he\u2019s still in this profession. Maybe it\u2019s simply a sign of respect for a coach whose program has achieved a level of consistency that remains the gold standard in the Big Ten.\n\nEither way, the tales illustrate Izzo\u2019s towering presence in the Big Ten. And the respect is mutual.\n\nAfter his team\u2019s 80-69 win over Michigan State this week, Ohio State head coach Chris Holtmann began his postgame news conference with an unprompted message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot about his team. Not about his players. It was about the coach on the opposing bench.\n\n\u201cWhen you get into a league, it can be pretty obviously competitive and pretty combative,\u201d Holtmann said. \u201cGuys can get isolated, but Tom has been an unbelievable friend, resource, mentor, whatever you want to call (it) to me. He really has. I\u2019ve called him on a number of occasions and asked his advice on things and tried to pick his brain. We were even texting last night after we both lost, back and forth while they were on the bus.\n\n\u201cI just really appreciate that from a guy who\u2019s a Hall of Famer who\u2019s one of the best to ever do it. And he is. He\u2019s one of the best to ever do it. So I just wanted to publicly say that he means a ton to me.\u201d\n\nStories like this are not uncommon in the Big Ten. Izzo often has referred to himself as a Big Ten guy. Part of that responsibility, in his mind, includes bringing other coaches along. Take Minnesota head coach Ben Johnson, for example.\n\nJohnson, a Minnesota native, is in the midst of his first season as the Golden Gophers\u2019 head coach. Izzo recruited Johnson out of high school many moons ago. He has been around long enough to watch Johnson rise from player to assistant to now head coach at his alma mater.\n\nWhen Johnson was named the head coach at Minnesota, he received a call from Izzo. It\u2019s a conversation Johnson referenced in his introductory news conference.\n\nTom Izzo called Ben Johnson when he got the @GopherMBB job. Izzo and Matt Painter have set the blueprint for long-term success in this league, and Johnson sees himself following it to become the next Izzo/Painter. \u2b07\ufe0f \"\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59 \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5a'\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude63\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude61.\" pic.twitter.com/twIo2LTwov \u2014 Big Ten Network (@BigTenNetwork) March 23, 2021\n\nWhen Michigan State beat Minnesota in December to open its Big Ten schedule, Izzo went out of his way to praise the school for getting \u201cthe right guy\u201d in Johnson. In his sideline interview immediately after the game and later in his postgame news conference, Izzo spoke highly of Johnson publicly, perhaps relating to a young head coach finding his way in a major conference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor a 40-year-old in his first major coaching role, the support is appreciated.\n\n\u201cI just think he\u2019s doing a hell of a job,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be a first-year head coach. To do that in the Big Ten is not easy. \u2026 I really believe that. I think it\u2019s going to be good for the Big Ten. When Minnesota is really good, that\u2019s just another shot for the Big Ten.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank him enough for being a sounding board \u2014 a guy that\u2019s a Hall of Famer,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do that to a guy who\u2019s a new kid on the block, but he\u2019s been great. I know we\u2019ll stay in touch.\u201d\n\nIllinois head coach Brad Underwood, who just captured a share of his first regular-season Big Ten championship, called his team\u2019s 56-55 victory over Michigan State in late January a \u201cculture win\u201d for his program.\n\nWithout context, a comment like that might not make sense. It\u2019s wasn\u2019t the first time Underwood has beaten Izzo. This isn\u2019t one of Izzo\u2019s best Michigan State teams. But it was significant in Underwood\u2019s mind. It was won without star big man Kofi Cockburn, on a night when former star Ayo Dosunmu was in attendance, against a coach who has built a program that Underwood would like to mirror.\n\n\u201cYou gotta understand,\u201d Underwood said that night. \u201cWhen you\u2019re at Daytona Beach Community College and you watch the Final Four and Tom Izzo\u2019s there, and now he\u2019s across from you and you\u2019ve really gotten to know the guy and what he stands for, he\u2019s just a great dude. But it\u2019s the program. And I envy that. You let me have one program in the country, I want to be like that one. And to stand for the things he stands for and the way he\u2019s done it, it means something to the fact that maybe we\u2019re getting a little bit in the same realm as that.\u201d\n\nAs Underwood and his Illinois program begin their own ascent, one Big Ten coach who has been around the block is Purdue\u2019s Matt Painter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPainter, a former Purdue point guard, accepted the job at his alma mater in 2005. He has since won three Big Ten titles, been named Big Ten Coach of the Year on four occasions, earned national coach of the year honors, taken his program to 12 NCAA tournaments \u2014 soon to be 13 \u2014 and racked up 380 career wins at Purdue.\n\nThese two head coaches have been on opposite sidelines in this conference for 17 years. It was Painter\u2019s Purdue program Michigan State defeated a few weeks ago to tie Knight\u2019s record. When asked about Izzo\u2019s place in Big Ten history, Painter painted the picture.\n\n\u201cTo pass an icon like that is huge,\u201d Painter said of Izzo closing in on Knight\u2019s record. \u201cHe\u2019s an icon \u2014 and it\u2019s staying at one place, too, which I\u2019m fond of. I just like the fact that he could have went a lot of places and didn\u2019t. The Big Ten was able to get that reward. Any time you can have consistency, it\u2019s a hard thing to do. Especially 14 schools, like, how can you be consistent and be great when you\u2019re upsetting the applecart after three seasons if somebody doesn\u2019t win enough games and stuff like that? I think a lot of people around here probably forget his first two seasons. But they stuck by him, and obviously, he took off from there. Won a Big Ten championship, won 10 since, been to eight Final Fours. He\u2019s been great.\u201d\n\nPerhaps more interesting than Painter\u2019s on-court perspective coaching against Izzo is the perspective he gained through his upbringing, admiring this conference from afar. Painter was born and raised in Indiana. His basketball knowledge was birthed from watching coaches like Knight and Gene Keady \u2014 a man he played for and succeeded at Purdue \u2014 patrol the sidelines at Indiana\u2019s major programs.\n\nKnight spent 29 years at Indiana. Keady spent 25 at Purdue. If you were a basketball fan raised in the state of Indiana during this era, it\u2019s all you knew.\n\nPainter sees that same impact in the state of Michigan, whether you root for Izzo\u2019s program or not.\n\n\u201cI grew up in Indiana and I just thought Gene Keady and Bob Knight would be the coaches at Purdue and Indiana forever,\u201d Painter said. \u201cLike, you didn\u2019t think anything different. It\u2019s kind of the little kid in ya, but like, that\u2019s kind of the way people in Michigan think. You can take a 26-year-old man in the state of Michigan and the only thing he knows is Tom Izzo\u2019s been at Michigan State. That\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cRecords are made to be broken,\u201d Izzo said Sunday. \u201cIf I\u2019m in the same sentence with Bobby Knight and Gene Keady, for Tom Izzo, that\u2019s a hell of a place to be.\u201d\n\nThis record, more than anything, is a testament to Izzo\u2019s staying power. He is a solidified presence in an era of coaches whose longevity serves as their calling card.\n\nRoy Williams, a winner of three national championships and 903 games, retired last spring. Williams, still sporting Carolina Blue, was on campus for Michigan State\u2019s win over Minnesota in mid-January. He spoke to Izzo\u2019s team. He told the players to enjoy the ride.\n\n\"Live in this moment, enjoy this moment, learn from this moment.\" Special to have Coach Williams around last night \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99 pic.twitter.com/V8JeI0m1fe \u2014 Michigan State Men's Basketball (@MSU_Basketball) January 13, 2022\n\nDuke\u2019s Mike Krzyzewski is wrapping up his retirement tour, set to step down at the end of the season after one of the most decorated coaching careers the sport has ever seen.\n\nIzzo and Coach K have had their share of moments through the years, whether it was battling for wins on the hardwood or the recruiting trail. Krzyzewski, 75, coached his final home game at Cameron Indoor Stadium this weekend. It was a 94-81 loss to rival North Carolina.\n\nYou knew Izzo wasn\u2019t going to let that slide.\n\n\u201cI thought it was gonna be last night at Duke there for a minute,\u201d Izzo joked when speaking to the crowd Sunday, referencing his team nearly blowing a lead and almost losing to Maryland on a day in which he and his seniors were honored. \u201cIt was a little scary.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a comment you can only make when you\u2019ve accomplished the things Izzo has, and his latest achievement further emphasizes that point. He has attained the sort of basketball cache that most coaches dream of. His program, even in a down year, is still a barometer of success for his peers in this conference \u2014 one that Izzo is now even more synonymous with.\n\nThere will be a point in time when Izzo, too, steps away and enjoys life after basketball. But that time is not now. Izzo is not yet done, and neither is Michigan State.\n\nThe Spartans will soon head to Indianapolis for the start of the Big Ten tournament. It will ultimately serve as a final tune-up for the NCAA Tournament \u2014 a bid Michigan State (20-11) has secured for the 24th year in a row. After a season of inconsistent play and a 3-7 finish, the Spartans won\u2019t be expected to make much noise. Deep down, that\u2019s probably how Izzo likes it.\n\nAs he paced back and forth near midcourt \u2014 mic in hand, addressing the crowd Sunday \u2014 visitors in attendance pulled out their phones, opened their camera apps and pointed it in his direction. Michigan State\u2019s student section, the one named after him, held up posters with the number \u201c663\u201d in bold letters. All eyes were on Izzo.\n\nThere\u2019s something to be said for a scene like this. It doesn\u2019t happen everywhere.\n\n\u201cYou all hung with us this year,\u201d Izzo said. \u201cHad a few ups and downs, but it\u2019s March. And March around here is special.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a reason for that.\n\n(Photo: Adam Ruff / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://spartanavenue.com/2022/05/25/michigan-state-basketball-tom-izzo-ranked-no-5-coach-2022-23/", "page_content": "NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 09: Head coach Tom Izzo of the Michigan State Spartans reacts to a call during their game against the Kansas Jayhawks in the first half of the State Farm Champions Classic at Madison Square Garden on November 9, 2021 in New York City. (Photo by Lance King/Getty Images)\n\nMichigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo may not be coming off a great season with the Spartans but he\u2019s still considered one of the greats.\n\nTom Izzo is a legend in the college basketball landscape. Not only is he one of the most winningest head coaches of all time, but he\u2019s also a Hall of Famer and a former national champion with Michigan State basketball.\n\nAlthough if you asked Izzo what he thought about how his career has played out to this point, he\u2019d probably tell you that he should have more championships and he hasn\u2019t accomplished nearly as much as he would have liked.\n\nBut even though he\u2019s hard on himself over his eight Final Fours, 24 straight NCAA Tournament appearances, one national title, and numerous Big Ten Tournament and regular-season titles, he is widely respected by fellow coaches, opposing players, and the media.\n\nAll you have to do is look at the annual ranking of college basketball\u2019s top head coaches.\n\nIsaac Trotter of 247Sports posted his ranking of the top 25 coaches in college basketball ahead of the 2022-23 season after two legends retired.\n\nTrotter ranked Izzo No. 5 behind Bill Self (No. 1), John Calipari (No. 2), Scott Drew (No. 3), and Mark Few (No. 4). This isn\u2019t a bad ranking, but given how disappointing the last two seasons have been for the Spartans, this is fairly generous. Plus, this means he\u2019s the best coach in the Big Ten.\n\nCoach K and Jay Wright both retired this offseason so he may have moved up a couple of spots because of that.\n\nA surprise national title-contending 2022-23 season will likely boost him up a spot or two in next year\u2019s rankings. Don\u2019t be shocked if Izzo turns this year\u2019s team into a title contender."}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/610137-college-basketball-tom-izzo-and-the-25-most-likable-coaches-in-the-country", "page_content": "0 of 25\n\nAndy Lyons/Getty Images\n\nWhenever we watch a college basketball game, we see two coaches prowling the sidelines, waiting to encourage their players in any way they can.

Others choose to remain stoic and let their teams figure things out for themselves. But regardless of style, some men are just better at winning over fans and players.\n\nThese are those men."}, {"url": "https://www.mlive.com/entertainment/2017/06/8_fascinating_facts_about_tom.html", "page_content": "Tom Izzo | MLive file photo by Tanya Moutzalias\n\nBy John Serba | jserba@mlive.com\n\nWay up there in the Upper Peninsula, Iron Mountain is one of Michigan\u2019s more fascinating towns. Its most significant exports are metal, pasties and sports coaches - and considering it\u2019s a town of about 7,600 people, that means the ratio of civilians to successful coaches is alarmingly high. Here are eight things about Iron Mountain that give it special distinction:\n\nDon't Edit\n\n1. Home of Izzo\n\nIzzo is just Izzo. He's surely the most famous Michigander known by a single name who isn't Madonna. The Michigan State University basketball coach is also easily the most famous person from Iron Mountain. He played basketball, track and football at Iron Mountain High and graduated from Northern Michigan University. He coached at Ishpeming High School, NMU and the University of Tulsa, with a brief stint as a part-time assistant at MSU thrown in there. In 1990, he was hired as MSU's associate head coach under Jud Heathcote, replacing him as head coach in 1995. The rest is history: seven Final Four appearances, seven Big Ten championships and one NCAA National Championship in 2000. He's the winningest coach in MSU history. He also grew up and was best friends with the town's second-most famous native, who we'll meet next.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nMLive file photo\n\n2. Steve Mariucci grew up there\n\nA former NFL head coach and current NFL Network analyst, \"Mooch\" went to NMU with his pal Izzo, where he quarterbacked the football team to an NCAA Division II championship. He began coaching in 1978 at NMU, subsequently bouncing between college and NFL teams; he famously was Brett Favre's quarterback coach for the Green Bay Packers. His first year leading an NFL team was his best - a 13-3 record and NFC Championship Game berth in 1997-98 with the San Francisco 49ers, whom he coached for six seasons. In 2003, he was hired as head coach of the Detroit Lions, where he lasted two-ish years before being canned mid-season by the team's profoundly inept general manager, Matt Millen. Don't worry, Mooch - you're not the only coach to see a career flameout in Detroit. We still love you.\n\nDon't Edit\n\n3. It's a football town, apparently\n\nA few other notable gridiron names grew up in Iron Mountain: Gene Ronzani coached the Green Bay Packers from 1950-53. Randy Awrey has been a coach for NCAA teams since 1990, and is currently with Concordia University Chicago. And Neno DaPrato was a first-team All American fullback in 1915 for Michigan Agricultural College, and played pro football for the Detroit Heralds and the Detroit Tigers.\n\nDon't Edit\n\n4. It boasts one of the world's tallest ski jumps\n\nThe Pine Mountain Ski Resort boasts a jump built in the late 1930s and towering 600 feet above the surrounding landscape. It's so tall, the wind is a significant factor, and at takeoff, skiers can reach speeds of 55-65 miles per hour. The spot hosts annual international competitions, where several distance records have been set. Not into zooming down a slope on two pieces of flat wood and rocketing yourself several hundred feet into the air? You can climb 500 stairs to the top and take in major eyefuls of beautiful scenery.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\n5. It's also home to a million bats\n\nHoly flapping mammals, Batman! The Millie Mine Bat Cave is one of the largest bat colonies in North America. The animals hibernate inside the abandoned iron mine, so the best time to see them is at dusk in April, when they're exiting the cave, and September, when they're entering. Note: you caped crusaders probably don't need to stock your utility belts with shark repellent while visiting.\n\nDon't Edit\n\n6. The father of the modern documentary film\n\nThe son of a prospector of course, Robert J. Flaherty was born and raised in Iron Mountain, and eventually became one of the filmmaking industry's most influential directors. When he began shooting nonfiction films, the word \"documentary\" didn't even exist; his 1922 work \"Nanook of the North\" is considered the first-ever commercially successful doc. It earned him a contract with Paramount Pictures, and he went on to make \"Moana,\" \"Tabu,\" \"Man of Aren\" and other pseudo-anthropological studies, which blended documentary subjects with written narratives. He won an Oscar in 1950 for \"The Titan: Story of Michelangelo.\"\n\nDon't Edit\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n7. What can you find there? Iron, of course\n\nThe most boring-social-studies-class fact on this list is also the most fundamental one. Iron Mountain is a prospecting town named after the rocks and minerals mined nearby. Iron ore was unearthed in the Menominee range in Dickinson County in 1849, and discovered in the specific Iron Mountain area in 1878. Not thrilling, but hey, without iron, there's no Iron Man.\n\nDon't Edit\n\n8. The largest steam pump ever\n\nThe mining industry led to the construction of the Chapin Mine Steam Pump Engine, which is the largest reciprocating steam-driven engine in the country. Known as the Cornish Pump, it was built in 1890 to pump water from the swampy mining territory. It weighs 725 tons and is 54 feet tall, with a 40-foot-diameter flywheel. A museum currently houses the pump, which is officially a National Historic Mechanical Engineering Monument, and has been featured on the History Channel.\n\nDon't Edit\n\nMLive photo | Emily Rose Bennett\n\nMore on the U.P.\n\n5 outdoor spots to take a date in Michigan this summer\n\n25 Upper Peninsula marvels everyone should see\n\nMichigan's Best: 13 U.P. pasties you must try\n\nMichigan's Best bloody mary: top 10 revealed\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nMore photos from Iron Mountain:\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit\n\nDon't Edit"}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1578960-michigan-state-basketball-why-tom-izzo-is-so-successful-in-ncaa-tournament", "page_content": "0 of 5\n\nMichigan State solidified its spot in yet another Sweet 16 Saturday afternoon. The Spartans surged past Memphis, 70-48, comfortably dispatching the Tigers in Auburn Hills in round of 32 action.\n\n\n\nThe thrill of a Sweet 16 berth never gets old, but it's almost become commonplace in East Lansing, where head coach Tom Izzo has reigned since 1995. Michigan State, rarely a mighty regular-season squad, has become a fixture in the final rounds of the NCAA tournament during the past decade-and-a-half.\n\n\n\nThe Spartans have advanced this far 11 times under Izzo's watch and own a 7-3 record in the round. Regardless of where Michigan State is seeded, it seems this squad finds a way to make do and push on through postseason rigors.\n\n\n\nIzzo, who has reached six Final Fours and claimed the 2000 national championship, isn't in the basketball Hall of Fame, but his eventual induction has become a formality at this point.\n\nThe 58-year-old Michigan native undoubtedly ranks among the nation's elite coaching minds, and most importantly, he provokes tremendous effort from his team on a perennial basis.\n\n\n\nAs Izzo prepares Michigan State for the final stretch toward a national title, it's an appropriate time to examine the factors that have made his tenure so consistently successful."}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1132773-tom-izzo-and-the-20-most-likeable-college-basketball-coaches-in-the-country", "page_content": "0 of 20\n\nCoaching in the college ranks can be a tough job.\n\nNot only do you have to ensure your team is prepared for the season, but you're also making recruiting trips around the country just so you can sign three to five high school seniors.\n\nTo go along with that, the coach has to be approachable by his players and open and honest with the media.\n\nWhen it comes to the best in the business, that honor goes to Tom Izzo.\n\nHere's a look at the 20 coaches who are the most likeable in college basketball."}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/149097-the-great-coach-myth-how-college-basketball-only-has-one", "page_content": "The attention of analysts, especially in college basketball, is mostly on coaches. The coaches are portrayed as the stars of college basketball by the media because they are the constants; the players are practically disposable commodities, turning over in four years at most.\n\nCollege players can\u2019t do commercials, mostly don\u2019t do interviews, and therefore, the head coach will become the face of any given program.\n\nKentucky and the attention surrounding its hiring of John Calipari has made evident the love affair with coaches.\n\nCalipari has been very successful in the last four years at Memphis and got UMass to a Final Four. He is certainly one of the better college coaches in America, but I for one do not believe he is a great coach.\n\nHe is a great recruiter. When one man can convince Derrick Rose and Tyreke Evans to play for him in consecutive years, he has a great skill in obtaining talent. But there is a big difference between recruiting and coaching talent.\n\nFor example, in college football, Pete Carroll is the best recruiter, as he gets immense talent to attend USC. He doesn\u2019t have to be a great coach for them to have success, as his school boasts an atmosphere in which players make the plays and the coach can supplement them bur not dominate them (as so many analysts think coaches do).\n\nRoy Williams is often mentioned as a great coach, and with his record, I can see why people think he is. But then again, look at the UNC team this year and their lineup. How many other Division I coaches could get that group to the Final Four?\n\nI would guess at least 10. Roy is a master of the college game, but that's where recruiting is first and coaching is second for most elite schools.\n\nArguing that Calipari or Rick Pitino are great coaches is to ignore their absolute failure on the professional level.\n\nIn their NBA stints, both had talent, and both were unsuccessful because they weren\u2019t able to play the recruiting game and handpick their talent.\n\nCoach K flirted with the NBA and the Lakers, and then decided to head back to Duke. It is a decision that he regrets, and it is easy to tell by his body language.\n\nDuke gets great talent every year, yet every year apologists claim that Duke doesn\u2019t have \"enough talent.\"\n\nIf you have seen Duke in the tournament the last few years, you definitely know that they do not have a great coach. Coach K is just good at recruiting, as Calipari and Pitino are; look at all of the very good NBA players who came from Duke. Coach K does not make them better once they arrive in Durham.\n\nThe key factor in a great coach is that he has decent talent and then makes them noticeably better. Only one coach has consistently done that for over a decade, and for that he should be recognized as the best coach in college basketball by far.\n\nBut Tom Izzo doesn't get the credit he deserves.\n\nMichigan State has good players; Izzo does have what it takes to get some talent to come to his school. Jason Richardson and Zach Randolph stand out, and there have been others, like Shannon Brown and Maurice Ager, with pretty solid credentials.\n\nHowever, more than any other school, Michigan State has role players that fit perfectly into the team. I watched two games featuring MSU over the weekend, and I know Goran Suton; that\u2019s it. Yet the Spartans have now made the Final Four five times in the last 11 years.\n\nAfter the Louisville game, pundits stated that most people didn\u2019t think that Michigan State was good enough to beat Louisville. If we were to judge solely on talent, \"most people\" would be correct, but Tom Izzo always builds a team that fit together well and noticeably improves players through his leadership. Come tournament time, the Spartans almost always look crisper, sharper, better prepared, and have a better understanding of what they need to do to succeed.\n\nThe only times Michigan State gets into trouble in the tournament is when the team and Izzo believe they have more talent than the other team; the losses to Nevada in 2004 and George Mason in 2006 are perfect examples of this.\n\nIzzo and his guys always appeared to be in control of what they wanted to do against Kansas, though it was a game they easily could have lost had they not shown composure.\n\nLouisville appeared baffled by the MSU defense, and despite a pretty hefty road-game feel in Indianapolis, the Spartans elevated their game even more.\n\nIn Detroit, MSU will definitely have the home-court advantage. UConn will have the best two players on the court come Saturday, plus a coach with an incredibly strong resume in Jim Calhoun. Yes, the Spartans will be the underdogs again and will be outsized in their matchups.\n\nOften it is very difficult to determine what is a great coaching job and what isn\u2019t when the game is taking place, seeing as how many things happen behind the scenes, in planning and workouts. But that is why Tom Izzo\u2019s performance stands out.\n\nSometimes Michigan State is not pretty to watch, because a lot of Big Ten opponents lack the talent of ACC and Big East teams, and the style is more defensively focused.\n\nTom Izzo is not in the same league of recruiting as Coach K or Roy Williams or John Calipari or Ben Howland, yet his results over the last decade have been just as good, if not better. Elevating good players to excellent results is the definition of a great coach, and Tom Izzo is the best coach in college basketball for that very reason."}, {"url": "https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state-university/2021/03/19/michigan-state-mum-tom-izzos-outburst-peers-rush-his-defense/4769715001/", "page_content": "Michigan State University officials were mum Friday after men's basketball coach Tom Izzo drew criticism on social media and in media circles following a halftime confrontation with junior Gabe Brown in Thursday's NCAA Tournament loss to UCLA.\n\nA spokesman for athletic director Bill Beekman said there would be no comment. Messages left with the office of President Samuel L. Stanley went unreturned.\n\nBut as school officials stayed quiet, college basketball peers continued to support Izzo, one of the game's most successful coaches.\n\nFollowing a defensive lapse by Brown just before halftime of the 86-80 overtime loss in West Lafayette, Indiana, Izzo and Brown had a heated exchange. The incident included reciprocal shouting, Brown putting his finger in Izzo's face, Izzo grabbing Brown by the arm and then by the jersey as Brown tried to walk away, up the tunnel. Izzo chased Brown down, and grabbed him by the waist, before the two disappeared from view of the television cameras.\n\nBrown hasn't been made available to the media. Izzo, unhappy about being asked about it despite the flap's national exposure, shrugged off the exchange following the loss. He called it a \"normal nothing,\" adding \"this day and age, everything is something.\"\n\nThe incident was reminiscent of another exchange during the NCAA Tournament two years ago, between Izzo and Aaron Henry, when Izzo had to be restrained by other players during a fiery discussion. Both shrugged it off afterward.\n\n\"Come on, it's part of coaching,\" Dick Vitale, the longtime ESPN analyst, told The News on Friday afternoon. \"He has great love for those kids, and they know it.\n\n\"Anybody that knows basketball knows his love is in the right place.\n\n\"He loves those kids, and they love him.\"\n\nThe debate has been split on social media, as it was among TBS analysts Thursday night and Friday morning. TBS's Kenny Smith said on air that the incident was \"extreme, that's not normal,\" while Charles Barkley, sitting just to Smith's left, shot down that opinion, saying the exchange is \"part of the game.\"\n\nThe takes on social media were just as varied.\n\nTwenty years ago, it wouldn't have been a story, coaches and analysts agree, but it's a different era. Izzo is a university employee \u2014 the school's second-highest-paid one, at $4.4 million a year, plus bonuses, behind football coach's Mel Tucker's $5.5 million \u2014 and what if a professor had a similar exchange with a student?\n\nMessages were sent to all 12 voting members of Michigan State's faculty senate. Ten didn't respond, and the two who did said they were unaware of the incident and, thus, couldn't comment.\n\n\"Anybody that has followed Michigan State basketball, and I've been to their practices, here's what it comes down to for me,\" said Steve Hawkins, the former head coach at Western Michigan. \"If you love your kids hard, you can coach them hard.\n\n\"And Coach Izzo loves his kids to death. ... That trust has been established, and once trust has been established, then it becomes easier to have those open conversations.\"\n\nThere have been a number of complaints of verbal abuse by college basketball coaches this year, the most extreme leading to the resignation of Greg Marshall at Wichita State. He also was accused of punching multiple athletes, and putting his hands around another player's neck.\n\nWe're running a new-subscriber special. Support local journalism, and subscribe here.\n\nAt Detroit Mercy, the university shut down the women's basketball season in January amid allegations of verbal abuse by first-year head coach AnnMarie Gilbert. The university continues to review the allegations, made by the parents of every player on the roster in a letter to administration, and has no timetable on a resolution, athletic director Robert Vowels told The News on Friday. Eight Detroit Mercy players are either in the transfer portal or already have left.\n\nA slew of Izzo's former players, including Draymond Green and Mateen Cleaves, expressed their support for the coach on social media, as you'd expect.\n\n\"You never want it to happen,\" Detroit Mercy's Mike Davis said. \"But sometimes it will.\"\n\nAnd it always has, said Vitale, who coached at Detroit and with the Detroit Pistons.\n\n\"You know when you go to Michigan State, schools like Kentucky and places like Duke, those coaches are on top because they demand excellence, they demand discipline,\" Vitale said. \"If you don't, they're going to let you know about it.\n\n\"But they're not going to hold any grudge. It's part of the process.\n\n\"He understands what it takes to win.\"\n\nMatt Charboneau contributed\n\ntpaul@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter: @tonypaul1984"}]}
