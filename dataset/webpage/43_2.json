{"Rudy Fernandez was a founding member of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW).": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-Farm-Workers", "page_content": "United Farm Workers (UFW), in full United Farm Workers of America, formerly National Farm Workers Association, U.S. labour union founded in 1962 as the National Farm Workers Association by the labour leaders and activists Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. It seeks to empower migrant farmworkers and to improve their wages and working conditions. The union also works to promote nonviolence and to educate members on political and social issues.\n\nIn 1965 the union gained prominence when it sponsored a strike by California grape pickers and a nationwide boycott of California grapes. The strike and boycott lasted until 1970, when most of the grape growers signed union contracts granting the farmworkers a higher minimum wage and health insurance benefits. Subsequent battles between the union and lettuce growers and other big farming businesses generally ended with the signing of collective bargaining agreements.\n\nMeanwhile, the union merged (1966) with the American Federation of Labor\u2013Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), and it was re-formed under its current name in 1971. In 2006 the UFW disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO and joined the labour federation Change to Win."}, {"url": "https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/dolores-huerta", "page_content": "Co-founder of the United Farm Workers Association, Dolores Clara Fernandez Huerta is one of the most influential labor activists of the 20th century and a leader of the Chicano civil rights movement.\n\nBorn on April 10, 1930 in Dawson, New Mexico, Huerta was the second of three children of Alicia and Juan Fernandez, a farm worker and miner who became a state legislator in 1938. Her parents divorced when Huerta was three years old, and her mother moved to Stockton, California with her children. Huerta\u2019s grandfather helped raise Huerta and her two brothers while her mother juggled jobs as a waitress and cannery worker until she could buy a small hotel and restaurant. Alicia\u2019s community activism and compassionate treatment of workers greatly influenced her daughter.\n\nDiscrimination also helped shape Huerta. A schoolteacher, prejudiced against Hispanics, accused Huerta of cheating because her papers were too well-written. In 1945 at the end of World War II, white men brutally beat her brother for wearing a Zoot-Suit, a popular Latino fashion.\n\nHuerta received an associate teaching degree from the University of the Pacific\u2019s Delta College. She married Ralph Head while a student and had two daughters, though the couple soon divorced. She subsequently married fellow activist Ventura Huerta with whom she had five children, though that marriage also did not last. Huerta briefly taught school in the 1950s, but seeing so many hungry farm children coming to school, she thought she could do more to help them by organizing farmers and farm workers.\n\nIn 1955 Huerta began her career as an activist when she co-founded the Stockton chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO), which led voter registration drives and fought for economic improvements for Hispanics. She also founded the Agricultural Workers Association. Through a CSO associate, Huerta met activist C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, with whom she shared an interest in organizing farm workers. In 1962, Huerta and Ch\u00e1vez founded the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), the predecessor of the United Farm Workers\u2019 Union (UFW), which formed three year later. Huerta served as UFW vice president until 1999.\n\nDespite ethnic and gender bias, Huerta helped organize the 1965 Delano strike of 5,000 grape workers and was the lead negotiator in the workers\u2019 contract that followed. Throughout her work with the UFW, Huerta organized workers, negotiated contracts, advocated for safer working conditions including the elimination of harmful pesticides. She also fought for unemployment and healthcare benefits for agricultural workers. Huerta was the driving force behind the nationwide table grape boycotts in the late 1960s that led to a successful union contract by 1970.\n\nIn 1973, Huerta led another consumer boycott of grapes that resulted in the ground-breaking California Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, which allowed farm workers to form unions and bargain for better wages and conditions. Throughout the 1970s and \u201880s, Huerta worked as a lobbyist to improve workers\u2019 legislative representation. During the 1990s and 2000s, she worked to elect more Latinos and women to political office and has championed women\u2019s issues.\n\nThe recipient of many honors, Huerta received the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award in 1998 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. As of 2015, she was a board member of the Feminist Majority Foundation, the Secretary-Treasurer Emeritus of the United Farm Workers of America, and the President of the Dolores Huerta Foundation."}, {"url": "https://libraries.ucsd.edu/farmworkermovement/medias/oral-history/", "page_content": "Oral History\n\nBelow you\u2019ll find audio from various events during the farmworker movement.

Francisco F. Medrano, known as Pancho Medrano, was an official for the United Auto Workers. He was active in local politics in Dallas, Texas, and supported the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee efforts in Texas and California. He was also well-known as a Mexican heavyweight boxing champion.\n\nDon Watson \u2013 Don Watson, the focus of this month\u2019s oral history, was a CP member between 1948 and 1956. One would be hard pressed to find a more dedicated adherent to the cause of labor. Watson retired from ship clerks Local 34 in 1993 after years of activist work for the ILWU and other unions, including the Marine Cooks and Stewards (MCS) in the early 1950s and the United Farm Workers (UFW) in the 1960s and 1970s. Today he is still helping the ILWU by assisting with the union\u2019s lobbying program at the California state capitol.\n\n1966 Virgin Banner: March to Sacramento \u2013 Our last story explores the birth of a major American labor and cultural movement. It\u2019s March 17, 1966. On a cold winter morning, a small group of mostly Mexican and Mexican-American farm workers set out by foot from Delano, California, to the state capitol in Sacramento. Their goal: to gain public support for their struggle to end over a hundred years of exploitation of. At first, few people take notice. But as the marchers passed through town after town, they picked up more and more supporters\u2026 and national more attention. Twenty-five days, and 350 grueling miles later, they reached the steps of the state capitol, ten thousand people strong. What started as a tiny group of largely ignored day laborers has grown into a powerful movement that captures the nation\u2019s attention. Their leader, C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, becomes a household name. The march marked a pivotal moment in American labor history, and the birth of a Latino cultural and political movement. Leading the way is a banner that hasn\u2019t been seen since. Over 30 years later, a woman from San Francisco believes this beautiful banner led the famous 1966 march. If she\u2019s right, then it\u2019s not only an artifact from a celebrated labor struggle, but also the symbolic focus of the emergence of Chicanos in American history. Vicki Vertiz came across the banner at San Francisco State University Labor Archives. In 1994, she joined another march commemorating C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s life and legacy.\n\nEL TEATRO CAMPESINO: \u201cMundo Mata\u201d \u2013 Introduction by Luis Valdez, performed in San Juan Bautista/May 2001. Premier performance in El Paso Texas (1976). Run-time: 2.27 Language: In English, with some Spanish. Synopsis: It is the summer of 1973, and the United Farm Workers are fighting for their lives. Led by Cesar Chavez, a march comes to Burlap, California, a fictional tank town in the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. This is the background for playwright, director and El Teatro Campesinos founder Luis Valdez vintage classic, Mundo Mata a period piece that exposes the raw realities of life in a small farmworker town. As part of an epic struggle to achieve victory in union elections among ranches up and down the state, the campaign in Burlap brings together two brothers and pulls them apart. One is Bullet Mata, who returns to his old hometown for the first time in twelve years; the other, his older brother Mundo, a Vietnam veteran. Bullet is a college dropout, turned Chavista sworn to non-violence. Mundo is a drug dealer, secretly hired by two growers to stop Chavez. While the issue of violence versus non-violence becomes a personal matter between the two brothers, Mundo Mata also resonates within a larger landscape of the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War. What if Cesar Chavez had been assassinated in 1973? Would history remember him differently? These are some of the questions implied in this gritty drama about the farmworkers struggle for justice. Mundo Mata premiered in 1976 in El Paso, Texas in the Chamizal Theater on the borderline with Juarez, Mexico. After being retired, the play was revived, rewritten and restaged, as documented in this 2001 production.\n\nRaul Trejo: \u201cDedicado a la Memoria Trabajo y Legado de Cesar Chavez\u201d \u2013 A four minute U-Tube video.

He moves his wife and eight small children to the dusty little Central Valley farm town of Delano and dedicates himself full-time to organizing farm workers. Dolores Huerta and others later join him.\n\n1962-1965\u2013With few funds and often baby-sitting the youngest of his eight children, Chavez drives to dozens of farm worker towns throughout California, painstakingly building up the membership of his infant organization. Believing field strikes and union contracts are years, perhaps decades, away, Chavez concentrates on offering farm workers modest benefits and meaningful services to join his infant organization.\n\nSept. 30, 1962\u2013The first convention of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) is convened with hundreds of delegates assembled in an abandoned movie theater in Fresno. The group\u2019s distinctive flag, a black eagle symbol on a white circle in a red field, is unveiled.\n\nSeptember 1965\u2013The mostly Filipino American members of another union, the AFL-CIO-affiliated Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), walk out on strike against Delano-area grape growers on Sept. 8, and ask Cesar\u2019s largely Latino NFWA to join the walkouts. On Sept. 16, Mexican Independence Day, the NFWA, with 1,200-member families, votes to join a strike. Thus begins the five-year Delano Grape Strike.\n\nFall, winter 1965-66\u2013The strike continues through the fall and winter months. Chavez begins to attract support from outside the valley, from labor, church, student and civil rights activists. United Auto Workers President Walter Reuther comes to Delano to support the strikers. The strikers begin boycotting the assorted products of Schenley Industries, a major area wine grape grower.\n\nMarch 1966\u2013U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy participates in hearings of the Senate Subcommittee on Migratory Labor. After listening to the Kern County Sheriff relate how his deputies arrested peaceful picketers because they were being threatened by struck growers, Kennedy suggests, \u00a1\u00b0that the sheriff and the district attorney read the Constitution of the United States.\u00a1\u00b1 Then the senator visits the union hall and picketlines, and supports the strikers.\n\nMarch-April 1966\u2013Chavez and a band of strikers embark upon a 340-mile peregrinacion (or pilgrimage) from Delano to the steps of the state Capitol in Sacramento to draw national attention to the plight of farm workers. During the march and after a four-month boycott, Schenley negotiates an agreement with NFWA\u2013the union\u2019s first contract. Thousands of supporters join the marchers on the steps of the Capitol in Sacramento on Easter Sunday.\n\nSpring-summer 1966\u2013A strike and boycott of the DiGiorgio Fruit Corp. (the fictional Gregorio Fruit Corp. in John Steinbeck\u2019s The Grapes of Wrath) forces the grape grower to agree to an election among its workers. The company brings in the Teamsters union to oppose Chavez\u2019s NFWA. Soon, NFWA and the Filipino American AWOC merge to form the United Farm Workers and the union affiliates with the AFL-CIO, the national labor federation. DiGiorgio workers vote for the UFW.\n\n1966\u2013Next, the UFW focuses on the Perelli-Minetti wine grape operation. Workers walk out on strike. The union succeeds through a boycott of its products. The UFW negotiates union contracts with the Christian Brothers and Almaden wineries. Also that year the UFW engages in farm worker walkouts in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas, battling violent strikebreaking tactics by the Texas Rangers.\n\n1967\u2013The UFW strikes Giumarra Vineyards Corp., California\u2019s largest table grape grower. In response to a UFW boycott, other table grape growers allow Giumarra to use their labels. So the UFW begins a boycott of all California table grapes. Meanwhile, strikes continue against other grape growers in the state.\n\n1967-1970\u2013Hundreds of grape strikers, union volunteers and supporters fan out across the U.S. and Canada to organize an international grape boycott. Millions of Americans rally to La Causa, the farm workers\u2019 cause.\n\nFebruary-March 1968\u2013Responding to growing talk by mostly male strikers about resorting to the use of violence, Chavez fasts for 25 days in Delano during the hungry winter of 1968 to rededicate his movement to the principals of nonviolence practiced by M.K. Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Just a month before he is assassinated, Dr. King sends a warm message expressing solidarity. Sen. Robert Kennedy joins 8,000 farm workers and supporters at a Catholic Mass where Chavez breaks his fast, calling the weakened farm labor leader \u201cone of the heroic figures of our time.\u201d There is no more talk of violence by the strikers, but Chavez spends more than a year recovering from painful back ailments aggravated by the fast.\n\nSpring 1968\u2013The UFW devotes full time efforts to Robert Kennedy\u2019s California Democratic presidential primary campaign in Latino barrios across the state. Some East Los Angeles precincts vote for Kennedy by margins of 99% and 100%. It is the first of hundreds of UFW-organized political campaigns that would follow, up to the present day.\n\nSpring-summer 1970\u2013As the boycott continues picking up steam, most California table grape growers sign UFW contracts. On July 29, 1970, led by the Giumarras, Delano-area table grape growers file into the union hall at the UFW\u2019s \u00a1\u00b0Forty Acres\u00a1\u00b1 headquarters in Delano to sign their first union contracts.\n\nSummer 1970\u2013To keep the UFW out of California lettuce and vegetable fields, most Salinas Valley growers sign \u00a1\u00b0sweetheart\u00a1\u00b1 contracts with the Teamsters Union. Some 10,000 Central Coast farm workers respond by walking out on strike. The UFW uses the boycott to convince some large vegetable companies to abandon their Teamster agreements and sign UFW contracts. Chavez calls for a nationwide boycott of non-union lettuce.\n\nDec. 10-24, 1970\u2013Chavez is jailed in Salinas, Calif. for refusing to obey a court order to stop the boycott against Bud Antle lettuce. Coretta Scott King, widow of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Ethel Kennedy, widow of Robert Kennedy, visit Chavez in the Salinas jail.\n\n1971\u2013The UFW moves from Delano to its new headquarters at La Paz in Keene, Calif., southeast of Bakersfield. With table and wine grape contracts, and some agreements covering vegetable workers, UFW membership grows to around 70,000. Meanwhile, the union engages in a number of smaller organizing and boycott drives.\n\n1972\u2013The UFW signs a contract with the Coca Cola Co. covering its Minute Maid citrus workers in Florida. The union defeats a Nixon administration bid to curb the UFW by placing the union under restrictions of federal labor statutes even though farm workers have been excluded from protections of the law since 1935; one million protest letters flood the National Republican Committee. The UFW is chartered as an independent affiliate by the AFL\u00a1\u00a9CIO; it becomes the United Farm Workers of America.\n\nMay 11-June 4, 1972\u2013Chavez fasts for 25 days in Phoenix over a just-passed Arizona law essentially banning the right of farm workers to strike, boycott or organize. The fast and resulting UFW-sponsored grass roots campaigns transform politics in the heavily Latino state where Chavez was born, leading to the election of Latino governors, including the current chief executive.\n\nSpring-summer 1973\u2013When the UFW\u2019s three-year grape contracts come up for renewal, growers?including the E&J Gallo winery?sign sweetheart pacts with the Teamsters without an election or any representation procedure. That sparks a bitter months-long strike by grape workers in California\u2019s Coachella and San Joaquin valleys. Some 3,500 nonviolent strikers are arrested for violating anti-picketing injunctions, many of which are later overturned as unconstitutional, hundreds of strikers are beaten, dozens are shot and two are murdered. In response to the violence, Chavez calls off the strike and begins a second grape boycott. Once again, strikers, union staff and volunteers spread out to cities across North America, organizing popular support for the boycotts of table grapes, lettuce and Gallo wine.\n\n1973-1975\u2013According to a nationwide 1975 Louis Harris poll, 17 million Americans are boycotting grapes. Many are also boycotting lettuce and Gallo wine.\n\nJune 1975\u2013Jerry Brown becomes California governor. In response to the strikes and boycotts?as well as mounting pressure from the supermarket industry?growers agree to a state law guaranteeing California farm workers the right to organize, vote in state-supervised secret-ballot elections and bargain with their employers. With help from Gov. Brown, the UFW wins passage of the landmark Agricultural Labor Relations Act.\n\nJuly-August 1975\u2013To educate farm workers about their newly-won rights, Chavez embarks upon his longest, and least known, march, a 1,000-mile 59-day trek from the Mexican border at San Ysidro north along the coast to Salinas and then from Sacramento south down the Central Valley to the UFW\u2019s La Paz headquarters at Keene, southeast of Bakersfield. Tens of thousands of farm workers march and attend evening rallies to hear Chavez and organize their ranches.\n\nSeptember 1975-January 1976\u2013Hundreds of elections are held. The UFW wins the majority of the elections in which it participates despite the fact at most companies it confronts growers illegally supporting an incumbent union, the Teamsters, in what experts predict is an unbeatable combination. The Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB), which enforces the law, briefly shuts down after running out of money because of the flood of election activity. Pro-grower lawmakers refuse to approve an emergency appropriation and push bills to weaken the law\n\nSpring, summer, fall 1976\u2013UFW organizers and volunteers collect hundreds of thousands of signatures to place their own initiative, Proposition 14, on the November ballot to restore the shut-down ALRB and prevent amendments weakening the farm labor law. Although a well-financed and deceptive grower TV ad campaign defeats the initiative, it forces the Legislature to restore funding for the ALRB.\n\nMid-to-late 1970s\u2013The UFW continues winning elections and signing contracts with growers. The union establishes comprehensive schools at its La Paz headquarters to train farm workers and union staff to become negotiators and contract administrators. In 1977, the Teamsters union signs an historic \u201cjurisdictional\u201d agreement with the UFW and agrees to leave the fields. In 1978, the UFW calls off its boycotts of grapes, lettuce and Gallo wines as it appears the law is working.\n\n1978\u2013The union initiatives a comprehensive statewide drive aimed at convincing the University of California to earmark a fraction of the research and development resources it devotes for the promotion of agricultural mechanization to aid the tens of thousands of farm workers whose livelihoods are wiped out by the machines. The campaign includes multiple seminars attended by hundreds of farm workers and activists across California, appeals to Gov. Jerry Brown and the UC Board of Regents, and legislation introduced at the state Capitol.\n\nJanuary-October 1979\u2013In a bid to improve wages and benefits, the UFW strikes a number of major lettuce and vegetable growers up and down the state. Grower foremen shoot to death Rufino Contreras, a 27-year old striker, in an Imperial Valley lettuce field.\n\nSeptember 1979\u2013After a strike and boycott, the UFW wins its demands for a significant pay raise and other contract improvements from SunHarvest, the nation\u2019s largest lettuce producer. Other growers also settle. The union begins a boycott of Bruce Church Inc. lettuce.\n\nSummer 1980\u2013Thousands of garlic workers in Santa Clara and San Benito counties join UFW strikes and vote for the union in state-conducted elections. Children as young as six years old qualify to vote in union elections. UFW demonstrators outside the Gilroy Garlic Festival include small children holding signs that read, \u00a1\u00b0Garlic worker.\u00a1\u00b1\n\nEarly 1980s\u2013With election victories and contract negotiations during the 1970s and early \u00a1\u00ae80s, the number of farm workers protected by UFW contracts grows to the mid-40,000s.\n\n1982\u2013Republican George Deukmejian is elected California governor with $1 million in grower campaign contributions.\n\n1983-1990\u2013Deukmejian\u2019s political appointees shut down enforcement of the state farm labor law. Thousands of farm workers lose their UFW contracts. Many are fired and blacklisted. Grower agents shoot Fresno-area dairy worker Rene Lopez, 19, to death just after he votes in a 1983 union election. Chavez declares a third grape boycott in 1984.\n\n1986\u2013Chavez kicks off the \u201cWrath of Grapes\u201d campaign to draw public attention to the pesticide poisoning of grape workers and their children.\n\nJuly-August 1988\u2013At age 61, Chavez conducts his last, and longest, public fast of 36 days in Delano to call attention to farm workers and their children stricken by pesticides.\n\nLate 1980s-early 1990s\u2013After recovering from his fast, Chavez continues pressing the grape boycott and aiding farm workers who wish to organize. The UFW wins elections to represent tomato workers in San Joaquin County. Workers at the state\u2019s largest tree fruit company vote for the UFW.\n\nSpring-summer 1992\u2013Working with UFW First Vice President Arturo Rodriguez, Chavez leads vineyard walkouts in the Coachella and San Joaquin valleys. As a result, grape workers win their first industry-wide pay hike in eight years.\n\nApril 23, 1993\u2013Cesar Chavez dies at the modest home of a retired San Luis, Ariz. farm worker while defending the UFW against a multi-million dollar lawsuit brought against the union by the large vegetable grower Bruce Church Inc.\n\nApril 29, 1993\u2013Some 40,000 mourners march behind Chavez\u2019s plain pine casket during funeral services in Delano.\n\nMay 1993\u2013Veteran UFW organizer Arturo Rodriguez succeeds Chavez as union president.\n\nMarch-April 1994\u2013On the first anniversary of Chavez\u2019s passing, Arturo Rodriguez leads a 343-mile march retracing the UFW founder\u2019s historic 1966 route from Delano to Sacramento. Some 17,000 farm workers and supporters gather on the state Capitol steps to help kick off a new UFW field organizing and contract negotiating campaign.\n\nAugust 8, 1994\u2013President Bill Clinton posthumously presents the Medal of Freedom, America\u2019s highest civilian honor, to Cesar Chavez. His widow, Helen, receives the medal during a White House ceremony.\n\n1994-2005\u2013Since the new UFW organizing drive began in 1994, farm workers vote for the UFW in union elections and the UFW signs many new, or first-time, agreements with growers. UFW membership rises from around 20,000 in 1993 to 27,000 individuals working at least one day out of the year under union contract. The union organizes and bargains on behalf of major rose, mushroom, strawberry, wine grape and lettuce and vegetable workers in California, Florida and Washington state, as well as some non-agricultural workers in California and Texas. The UFW also continues its tradition of mobilizing mass grass roots support for pro-farm worker political candidates in California, Arizona and Texas.\n\nMid- to late-1990s\u2013Despite intense industry resistance, the UFW mounts a major organizing campaign in the Central Coast strawberry industry. It results in two union contracts, including Coastal Berry Co., the nation\u2019s largest direct employer of strawberry workers.\n\n1999-2005\u2013The UFW wins enactment of key laws and regulations benefiting farm workers, from seat belts in farm labor vehicles and fresh protections for workers cheated by farm labor contractors to an historic binding mediation law and new pesticide protections. The UFW convinces Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2005 to issue an emergency regulation preventing further heat deaths of farm workers and all outdoor employees.\n\n2000-2005\u2013With government statistics showing most farm workers are undocumented, over a three year period the UFW and the nation\u2019s agricultural industry negotiate the historic AgJobs bill, compromise federal legislation that would allow undocumented farm workers in this country now to earn the legal right to permanently stay in the U.S. by continuing to work in agriculture. Introduced in 2003, it wins broad, bipartisan support from more than 500 organizations, including labor, business, Latino, immigrant rights and clergy groups. In April 2005, AgJobs becomes the first major immigration reform bill in nearly 20 years to win support from a majority of U.S. senators, many of them Republicans, on a upper-house floor vote, although it doesn\u2019t muster the \u00a1\u00b0supermajority\u00a1\u00b1 required to overcome a filibuster. AgJobs\u2019 principal Senate sponsors, Larry Craig (R-Idaho) and Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) pledge to bring it up the measure again.\n\n2000-2005\u2013The UFW increasingly makes use of the Internet to solicit mass grass-roots participation in union organizing, boycott, legislative and political campaigns by tens of thousands of farm workers and supporters across North America. The UFW\u2019s own list serve reaches 50,000 active members. Hundreds of thousands of supporters are involved through UFW appeals forwarded by allied and sympathetic organizations.\n\nSummer, fall 2002\u2013The UFW organizes massive public support, including a much-publicized 150-mile march from Merced to Sacramento, to convince then Gov. Gray Davis to sign the UFW-sponsored binding mediation law, the first time the Agricultural Labor Relations Act has been amended since its passage in 1975.\n\n2005\u2013The latest UFW organizing drives include a successful 22-month legal and contract campaign?and a three-month boycott?that produces a new contract with Gallo winery in Sonoma. The union mounts a major organizing drive among Central Valley table grape workers resulting in a summer election at Giumarra vineyards, America\u2019s largest table grape producer. Labor observers say it is one of the largest private sector union election campaigns in the nation in 2005. In November 2005, the state farm labor board rules the UFW has established a prima facie case that the election should be thrown out because of numerous violations of the law by Giumarra."}, {"url": "https://worldhistoryproject.org/1966/8/22/the-united-farm-workers-organizing-committee-ufwoc-is-formed/", "page_content": "On August 22, 1966, the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC), later renamed the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), was formed.\n\nThe UFWOC was established when two smaller organizations, the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) and the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), both in the middle of strikes against certain California grape growers, merged and moved under the umbrella of the AFL-CIO. Under the founding leadership of Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, the UFW won many labor or civil rights concessions for disenfranchised Mexican-American farmworkers, an important aspect of the Chicano movement. The Chicano movement has been an often-ignored part of the civil rights struggles in the 1960s; it was, nonetheless, a landmark period for the second-largest ethnic minority in the U.S.\n\nBefore the rise of the UFW, working conditions were harsh for most agricultural workers. On average, farmworkers made about ninety cents per hour plus ten cents for each basket of produce they picked. Many workers in the field were not provided even the most basic necessities such as clean drinking water or portable toilets. Unfair hiring practices, such as favoritism and kickbacks, were rampant. Seldom were their living quarters equipped with indoor plumbing or cooking facilities."}, {"url": "https://ufw.org/research/history/ufw-history/", "page_content": "UFW History\n\nThe Rise of the UFW\n\nFor more than a century farmworkers had been denied a decent life in the fields and communities of California\u2019s agricultural valleys. Essential to the state\u2019s biggest industry, but only so long as they remained exploited and submissive farmworkers had tried but failed so many times to organize the giant agribusiness farms that most observers considered it a hopeless task. And yet by the early 1960\u2019s things were beginning to change beneath the surface. Within another fifteen years more than 50,000 farmworkers were protected by union contracts.\n\nThe Bracero program, an informal arrangement between the United States and Mexican governments, became Public Law 78 in 1951. Started during World War II as a program to provide Mexican agricultural workers to growers, it continued after the war.\n\nPublic Law 78 stated that no bracero-a temporary worker imported from Mexico-could replace a domestic worker. In reality this provision was rarely enforced. In fact the growers had wanted the Bracero program to continue after the war precisely in order to replace domestic workers.\n\nThe small but energetic National Farm Labor Union, led by dynamic organizer Ernesto Galarza, found its efforts to create a lasting California farmworkers union in the 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s stymied again and again by the growers\u2019 manipulation of braceros.\n\nOver time, however, farmworkers, led by Cesar Chavez, were able to call upon allies in other unions, in churches and in community groups affiliated with the growing civil rights movement, to put enough pressure on politicians to end the Bracero Program by 1964\n\n.\n\nCONDITIONS OF FARM WORKERS & THEIR WORK\n\nBut some things hadn\u2019t changed. Grape pickers in 1965 were making an average of $.90/hour, plus ten cents per \u201clug\u201d (basket) picked. State laws regarding working standards were simply ignored by growers. At one farm the boss made the workers all drink from the same cup \u201ca beer can\u201din the field; at another ranch workers were forced to pay a quarter per cup. No ranches had portable field toilets. Workers\u2019 temporary housing was strictly segregated by race, and they paid two dollars or more per day for unheated metal shacks-often infested with mosquitoes-with no indoor plumbing or cooking facilities.\n\nFarm labor contractors played favorites with workers, selecting friends first, sometimes accepting bribes. Child labor was rampant, and many workerswere injured or died in easily preventable accidents. The average life expectancy of a farmworker was 49 years.\n\nNEW ORGANIZATIONS, NEW POSSIBILITIES\n\nTwo organizations attempted to represent and organize the farmworkers. One had been formed in 1959 by the AFL-CIO, called the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee. It was an outgrowth of an earlier farmworker organization, the Agricultural Workers Association (AWA), founded by Dolores Huerta. AWOC was mostly composed of Filipinos, Chicanos, Anglos and Black workers. The Filipino workers in particular had experience organizing unions in the fields and with strikes. Two of its early leaders were Larry Itliong, a Filipino, and Dolores Huerta, a Chicana.\n\nThe National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) was started by a young Chicano named Cesar Chavez in 1962. Chavez, the son of a family of extremely poor farmworkers, had risen through the ranks of the grassroots Community Service Organization (CSO) to become its national director. CSO worked with communities to solve problems through organizing and direct action. But when CSO refused to concentrate its efforts on organizing farmworkers, Chavez left to found the NFWA. From his base in Delano, he traveled for three years from town to town in the central valleys of California, meeting with groups of farmworkers in their homes, tirelessly building an organization he hoped would one day become an effective union. His co-founder was Dolores Huerta, one of the CSO\u2019s farmworker activists.\n\nBEFORE THE BEGINNING\n\nTwo short strikes occurred in the spring of 1965. Eighty-five farmworkers in a McFarland rose farm asked the NFWA to help them gain a wage increase. Assisted by Chavez and Huerta, the workers struck. After a few days the growers agreed to the wage increase but not to union recognition. The workers contented themselves with the money and returned to work.\n\nAround the same time AWOC led a walkout of hundreds of Filipino and Mexican grape pickers in Coachella Valley. Although the bracero program had officially ended the year before, a new U.S.-Mexico agreement allowed growers to import Mexican workers, if they were paid $1.25 an hour, and never paid more than domestic workers. When Coachella grape growers attempted to pay the local workers less than the imported workers, the Filipinos, many of whom were AWOC members, refused to work.\n\nCoachella grapes, grown in southernmost California, ripen first in the state. Getting the grapes picked and to market quickly is crucial to the Coachella growers\u2019 profits. After ten days the growers decided to pay everyone $1.25 per hour, including Chicanos who had joined the Filipinos. Once more, however, no union contract was signed.\n\nIT STARTED IN DELANO\n\nAt the end of summer the grapes were ripening in the fields around Delano, a farm town north of Bakersfield. Many of the farmworkers from the successful Coachella action had come up to Delano, trailing the grape harvest. Farmworkers demanded $1.25 per hour, and when they didn\u2019t receive it, on September 8 nine farms were struck, organized by AWOC\u2019s Larry Itliong.\n\nAfter five days growers began to bring in Chicano scabs from the surrounding area. AWOC approached Chavez and asked the NFWA to join the mostly Filipino strike. At a meeting on September 16, packed with hundreds of workers, at Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Delano, the NFWA voted unanimously, to shouts of \u201cViva la Huelga!\u201d, to strike too. Chavez was apprehensive. Asked later when he felt his organization-which had $100 in its bank account, would have been ready to go out on a big strike, he replied, \u201cAbout 1968.\u201d\n\nIn joining the strike, the NFWA, with many more members than AWOC, took the lead. It also strengthened the ethnic make up of the strike: now the majority of workers involved were Chicano. By September 20 more than thirty farms were out, with several thousand workers leaving the fields. Despite the large numbers of striking farmworkers, however, the workers could not muster picket lines at all the ranches simultaneously. There were many fields strung across hundreds of miles.\n\nNFWA and AWOC set up a system of roving pickets, with different fields picketed each day. Fifteen or twenty cars full of pickets would go to a field where a grower was attempting to use strikebreakers. Striking workers, often harassed by the growers and police, sometimes violently, would try to get the scabs to leave the fields. Remarkably, their appeals were successful much of the time in persuading workers to join the strike.\n\nThe growers made a mistake almost immediately. They had always been able to end strikes with small wage concessions. Soon after the strike began, they raised wages to $1.25 per hour. This time they were shocked to discover it wasn\u2019t enough. The raise merely encouraged the strikers to believe they were being effective. Now there had to be a union, too.\n\nSQUEEZING THE COMPANIES WITH A BOYCOTT\n\nShortly after the strike erupted, Chavez called upon the public to refrain from buying grapes without a union label. Union volunteers were sent out to big cities, where they established boycott centers that organized friendly groups-unions, churches, community organizations-to not buy grapes, and in turn to join in publicizing the boycott.\n\nThe strikers\u2019 cause was boosted by other events in the nation at the same time. The Civil Rights movement had increased public awareness of the effects of racism, including lowered standards of living for the victims of prejudice in housing, employment, schools, voting, and other areas of daily life. The Civil Rights movement focused attention on the treatment of Blacks in the south. But the situation in the fields of California proved similar enough that the largely Chicano and Filipino farmworkers benefited by the new public understanding of racism. As a result, millions of consumers stopped buying table grapes.\n\nTHE BIGGER THEY ARE . . .\n\nThe two biggest growers in the Delano area, Schenley and DiGiorgio, were the most vulnerable to the boycott. Both companies were owned by corporate entities with headquarters far from Delano. For each company grape growing was a relatively minor part of a larger economic empire. Schenley and DiGiorgio had union contracts with workers in many other parts of their business. The boycott had the potential to hurt sales in other product areas, and to harm labor relations with their other workers.\n\nSchenley was the first to crack. Soon after the strike began Schenley had sprayed striking workers with agricultural poisons. In protest the NFWA organized a march to Sacramento. Seventy strikers left Delano on foot on March 17, 1966, led by Chavez. They walked nearly 340 miles in 25 days. Along the way they picked up hundreds of friends and rallied with thousands of people. A Chicano theater group, El Teatro Campesino, staged skits about the struggle from the back of a flatbed truck every night. The march attracted media attention and public support. Arriving in Sacramento on Easter morning, Chavez announced to a cheering demonstration of 10,000 supporters in front of the Capitol building that Schenley had bowed before the pressure and signed an agreement with the NFWA.\n\nWithin weeks, DiGiorgio agreed to hold a representation election. But before the election could be held, a complication arose. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, ignoring the questions of social justice at the core of the farmworkers\u2019 campaign for union recognition, offered itself to DiGiorgio as a conservative alternative to the NFWA/AWOC. The grower eagerly assented. Chavez and the NFWA, infuriated at this betrayal by another union, called for the workers to boycott the election. Heeding the call of the union, more than half the 800 workers at DiGiorgio\u2019s huge Sierra Vista ranch refused to vote.\n\nGovernor Pat Brown appointed an arbitrator, who ordered another election. This time the NFWA beat the Teamsters decisively. The two largest growers in Delano were employers of union labor.\n\nLA HUELGA CONTINUES\n\nHowever, the strike dragged on at dozens of grape farms throughout the Delano area. In the past a farmworkers\u2019 union would have been unable to survive such a long conflict. But there was strength in worker solidarity. NFWA and AWOC merged during the summer, just before the DiGiorgio election. On August 22, the two organizations became the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee, AFL-CIO (UFWOC). The new union received organizing funds from the AFL-CIO, as well as strike support from other unions consisting of food, cash, and office equipment.\n\nDespite continuing Teamster collusion with the growers, the UFWOC organized steadily in the fields, and the grape boycott gathered steam in the cities. By 1970 the UFW got grape growers to accept union contracts and effectively organized most of that industry, claiming 50,000 dues paying members \u2013 the most ever represented by a union in California agriculture. Gains included a union-run hiring hall, a health clinic and health plan, credit union, community center and cooperative gas station, as well as higher wages. The hiring hall meant an end to discrimination and favoritism by labor contractors.\n\nIn cities around the country UFW support became stronger. UFWOC, as Chavez had envisioned, had become both a union and a civil rights movement, and this was the key to its success. The dual character of the farmworkers organization gave it a depth of moral pressure and sense of mission felt by members and supporters alike. It seemed as if the farmworkers of California had finally created a union that would last."}, {"url": "https://nfwm.org/farm-workers/farmworker-partners/united-farm-workers-of-america/", "page_content": "Begun in 1962 by Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, Gilbert Padilla, and other early organizers, the United Farm Workers of America is the nation\u2019s first enduring and largest farm workers union. The UFW continues organizing in major agricultural sectors, chiefly in California. The UFW has dozens of union contracts protecting thousands of farm workers, among them agreements with the some of the largest berry, winery, tomato, dairy and mushroom companies in California and the nation.\n\nMany recent UFW-sponsored laws and regulations protect all farm workers in California, especially those at non-union ranches. They include the first state standards in the U.S. to prevent further deaths and illnesses from extreme heat and in 2016 the first law in the country providing farm workers in California with overtime pay after eight hours a day. The UFW continues to actively champion legislative and regulatory reforms for farm workers covering issues such as worker protections, pesticides and immigration reform.\n\nHistory\n\nThe UFW has been inspiring farm workers across the U.S. to organize, mobilizing allies in the struggle, and spreading the \u201c\u00a1S\u00ed se puede!\u201d (yes it can be done) message for over 50 years.\n\nIn 1965, the mostly Filipino American members of another union went out on strike in the grape vineyards around Delano, CA. Cesar Chavez and the farm workers he had been organizing in the National Farm Workers Association joined the strike. This Delano Grape Strike grew to other growers and lasted 5 years.\n\nIn 1966, Chavez and a group of strikers set out on a 340-mile march from Delano to Sacramento to draw attention to plight of farm workers, and during this strike the union won its first contract. Thousands of supporters joined the marchers.\n\nIn 1967, the UFW began a boycott against all California table grapes, igniting faith-based groups, unions, and community organizations to join and publicize the boycott. During this time, the Civil Rights movement in the U.S. had increased the general public\u2019s awareness of the effects of racism. This climate of higher political consciousness contributed to millions of consumers joining the boycott (a nationwide poll in 1975 estimated 17 million Americans were boycotting table grapes).\n\nThroughout the struggle, the UFW remained dedicated to principles of nonviolence; Cesar Chavez fasted for 25 days in 1968 to demonstrate this commitment. In 1975, UFW won the passage of the Agricultural Labor Relations Act, a landmark agreement recognizing the right of farm workers in California to organize. Since those early decades, the UFW has continued to win important victories for farm workers in agricultural industries across the U.S.\n\nNFWM and UFW\n\nNFWM and UFW share a long and rich history. NFWM began in 1920 as a ministry of charity and service through the National Council of Churches, providing food, clothing and day care to farm workers. When Cesar Chavez began organizing the UFW in the 1960s, he called on the religious community to change its emphasis from charity to justice. NFWM became the vehicle for people of faith to respond to that call and has continued in solidarity with the UFW throughout its history.\n\nKey NFWM Actions in Support of UFW\n\nDuring the mid-1960s, the UFW and California Migrant Ministries partnered in support of farm worker justice through boycotts of major California table grape growers. More state Migrant Ministries joined in and helped grow the grape boycott nationally into one of the major social movements of the 1960s and 70s.\n\nState Migrant Ministries along with denominational partners, under the umbrella of the National Council of Churches, came together in 1971 and incorporated as NFWM.\n\nAfter the victorious signing of union contracts by California grape growers in 1970, the UFW called on NFWM to support a national boycott of non\u2010union lettuce following major lettuce and vegetable strikes in the Salinas Valley.\n\nIn the 1980s, led by the UFW through the \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d Campaign, NFWM educated thousands of people of faith about the dangers of pesticides for farm workers and their children.\n\nNFWM\u2019s growing base of supporters mobilized for the second grape strike and further UFW organizing efforts throughout the succeeding decade.\n\nAfter Cesar Chavez\u2019s death in 1993, NFWM remained untiring supporters of the UFW. From the 1990s through 2000s, NFWM educated and mobilized supporters around the U.S. for UFW campaigns with companies including Coastal Berry Co., Pictsweet Mushrooms, Gallo of Sonoma and Threemile Canyon Dairy.\n\nIn 2005, NFWM supported the UFW-led effort to pass AgJobs (the first major immigration reform bill since the 1980s) and we continue following the UFW\u2019s lead on immigration reform legislation.\n\nSince the early 2000s, NFWM has supported multiple UFW organizing campaigns including Giumarra, Darigold and Gerawan Farming and supporting significant California legislative victories such as the 2002 Mandatory Mediation law and the 2016 Over-time for Farmworkers law.\n\nLearn how you can get involved!\n\nLast updated 06/2018"}, {"url": "https://www.influencewatch.org/labor-union/united-farm-workers-of-america/", "page_content": "The United Farm Workers of America (UFW) is a labor union representing agricultural workers, mostly in the state of California. Cesar Chavez, a Mexican-American organizer and leader of the Chicano movement, founded the union; Chavez would become one of the best-known leaders of labor unionism in the 20th century through leading large-scale farm worker strikes in California and organizing national boycotts of grapes and lettuce.\n\nThe union is based in California and principally represents workers under California\u2019s state-level farm-worker collective bargaining procedures. It is a member union of the Change to Win labor federation and is associated with a number of left-leaning labor organizations and causes such as the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the Fight for $15 campaign, and Black Lives Matter.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\n\nThe United Farmworkers of America was founded in 1962 by Cesar Chavez, a Mexican-American organizer who had previously worked as a national director of the Community Service Organization (CSO). Frustrated by the lack of focus on aiding farmworkers from the CSO, Chavez left the organization to start the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA). In the beginning the union mostly consisted of Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans at a time when agreements between the U.S. and Mexico allowed California growers to hire Mexican nationals as workers as long as they were not paid more than domestic workers. In 1965 the upstart union led its first strike against California grape growers, which led to a wage increase but no formal union recognition.\n\nLater in 1965, the NFWA was asked to join a strike led by an older farmworkers union, the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), which had smaller membership of both Filipino and Mexican migrant workers. In 1996, the two unions merged into the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee and gain an affiliation with the AFL-CIO.\n\nAs the unions began to merge into one entity and conduct strikes against more farms across California, Chavez also organized national boycotts with organizers sent into big cities to encourage consumers to refrain from buying lettuce and grapes from California growers due to working conditions and pay of farmworkers. Through the boycotts, Chavez became solidified as a national figure and as a leader of the Chicano Movement, which fought against anti-Mexican-American discrimination in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nCesar Chavez\n\nFollowing the rise of the United Farm Workers, its founder Cesar Chavez became a national figure of the labor movement and was seen as a hero to many in the Latino community. While Chavez was successful in many of his goals around bringing attention to farmworkers movement, he has been criticized by many in the labor movement for not embracing illegal immigrant workers and bringing them into the fold of the UFW. Chavez was said to have viewed illegal immigrants with antipathy and viewed them as strikebreakers and a hindrance to the work of the union. He also was reported to have often wrangled with union members who wanted more of a say in the union\u2019s operations, insisting on maintaining a firm grasp on union operations. When Chavez died in 1993, his son-in-law, Arturo Rodriguez, took over as president of UFW.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden took office in 2021, he redecorated the oval office with a bust of Cesar Chavez positioned behind the resolute desk. Left-leaning immigration activists praised Biden for displaying the bust and pointed to it as a symbol of the Biden Administration taking action regarding liberal expansionist immigration policies.\n\nActivities\n\nIn recent years, the United Farm Workers of America has been faced with many organizational challenges and has seen its influence and membership dwindle. The organization\u2019s membership peaked at between 30,000 and 40,000 in the 1970s, but as of early 2021 stands at just around 6,200. The union\u2019s health insurance plan has only remained functioning due to subsidies provided by the California State Legislature, and its pension fund has been designated as at \u201ccritical status\u201d by the U.S. Department of Labor. One labor activist conceded that the union is only successful as an education organization and no longer is helpful as an operating labor union.\n\nThe UFW has increasingly had to deal with decertification votes, where employees at a particular location vote to disaffiliate with the union.

The event was a mass strike or walk out in 25 different cities in the wake of the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Police custody.\n\nThe strike included UFW members as well as union members in the fast food, ride-share, nursing home, and airport industries. Other unions and left-leaning groups taking part in the event were the SEIU, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the American Federation of Teachers, the SEIU-funded Fight for $15 campaign, March On, the Center for Popular Democracy, the National Domestic Workers Alliance and the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nRather than racial issues, the protest was mostly centered around traditional union demands and sought to press elected officials in state and federal offices to pass laws that would require employers to raise wages."}, {"url": "https://parnet.org/the-united-farm-workers-of-america/", "page_content": "The United Farm Workers of America\n\nThe United Farm Workers of America (UFW) is an American labor union which represents farmworkers in the United States. Founded by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, the UFW was originally called National Farm Workers Association. The UFW was founded in 1962 with the goal of improving wages and working conditions for migrant laborers through strikes, boycotts, and grape boycotts. The UFW has also been active in fighting against the exploitation of farmworkers since its establishment, including support for legislation that would provide more protections to these workers. The UFW has successfully negotiated contracts with large growers, such as Driscoll\u2019s Berries-the world\u2019s largest berry producer-and with their parent company.\n\nHistory\n\nThe United Farm Workers of America (UFW) is a labor union founded in 1962 by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. The UFW was the first farmworkers\u2019 union in the country, and it helped to bring about significant changes in work conditions for migrant agricultural laborers, including access to drinking water, toilets, clean clothing and pesticides. The UFW has been described as one of the most successful labor unions in modern American history. In 1973 it won a landmark victory when the California State Legislature passed legislation giving farmworkers the right to form a union without fear of being fired.\n\nMission\n\nThe United Farm Workers of America is the first union of farmworkers in the country. The UFW is a grassroots organization that was founded in 1962 by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. In 1967, they were successful in passing legislation to outlaw the use of pesticides that were harmful to farmworkers and their families. Mission: The United Farm Workers of America (UFW) is a grassroots organization with over 100,000 members working for social and economic justice for farmworkers and their families since 1966. They advocate for better wages, benefits, and working conditions through community organizing, legislative lobbying, public education, nonviolent direct action such as boycotts or strikes, worker-to-worker education programs on the job site.\n\nOrganization\n\nThe United Farm Workers of America (UFW) is a union of migrant farmworkers. The union was founded in 1962 by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. Throughout the 1960s, UFW led strikes for better pay and treatment for migrant farmworkers. They also fought against unfair labor practices, such as blacklisting, which is when employers refuse to hire someone because they are a member of a certain group or organization. In 1970, California voters passed Proposition 14 (also known as the \u201cRight-to-Work\u201d law), which banned the closed shop, meaning that all workers had to be members of unions before they could work at an establishment.\n\nGoals\n\nThe United Farm Workers of America (UFW) is a labor union in the United States. The UFW was founded in 1962 by Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta to fight for improved working conditions for migrant farmworkers, who were often paid less than minimum wage and were exposed to dangerous pesticides. In its early years, the UFW won substantial increases in wages and benefits, as well as better living conditions for migrant farmworkers. However, there are still many problems with today\u2019s migrant farmworker system. For example, some employers refuse to pay overtime or provide shade from the sun. In addition, some employers do not reimburse expenses such as transportation costs or protective clothing that was necessary for work.\n\nMembership\n\nThe United Farm Workers of America is a labor union that represents farmworkers in the United States. The organization was founded on September 16, 1962, by Filipino American migrant laborers who organized to demand better working conditions and higher wages. The UFW first gained national attention when it won a strike against grape growers in Delano, California in 1965. The UFW continues to work for the rights of all farmworkers today by fighting for fair wages with contracts through boycotts and strikes. Migrant farmworkers are people who work on farms during harvest seasons but live most of the year somewhere else. Migrant farmworkers are often seen as immigrants because they usually don\u2019t speak English well or have much education."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/plants-and-animals/animals/agriculture-animals/united-farm-workers-america", "page_content": "United Farm Workers of America\n\nP.O.

Founded by charismatic leader, Cesar Chavez, UFW reached the peak of its influence in the 1970s, then declined until his death in 1993. Under new leadership the UFW has since taken steps to rebuild and find its place in a world far different than when the organization burst onto the scene in the 1960s as La Causa and attracted a host of celebrity supporters. The UFW is best known for its successful boycott of California grapes that led to unprecedented gains for farmworkers. Other achievements include the first contracts to provide rest periods, drinking water, toilets, and hard washing facilities in the fields, the banning of pesticide spraying while workers were in the field, and protective clothing to guard against exposure to pesticides; guaranteed senior and job security; contracts that included profit sharing and parental leave; the first comprehensive union health benefits for farmworkers and their families; the first pension plan for retired farmworkers; and a farmworker credit union. The organization has an estimated 50,000 members. In addition to its national headquarters in Keene, California, UFW maintains several other offices in California as well as in Florida and Washington state.\n\n19TH-CENTURY BACKGROUND: CORPORATE FARMING AND NEED FOR FARMWORKERS\n\nThe bulk of UFW\u2019s activities have been conducted in California, where corporate farming in the United States took root around the same time that the railroad connected the fertile farmlands of the state to the eastern markets in the 1860s. The railroad barons and other industrials acquired vast tracts of land with the idea of growing large quantities of food to ship back east on their railroads, which in turn would bring other goods to the growing West Coast population. Many of the Chinese laborers who had laid the roads now harvested the crops. A downturn in the economy and discrimination led to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and the Chinese were replaced in the field by poor white European immigrants, followed by the Japanese at the dawn of the 20th century, and Mexicans who regularly crossed the borders to work the harvests. Early in the 1900s some Japanese and Mexican workers joined forces to organize associations to demand wage increases, but being minorities they received no support from America\u2019s labor movement. Spurred by accommodating legislation, other immigrants groups came in waves to California\u2019s fields to work at low wages and under harsh conditions, but always it was the Mexicans who came to the North and by the 1920s were the main source of California\u2019s laborers.\n\nDuring the Great Depression and the days of the Dust Bowl in the Southwest, where ownership of agricultural land had also become heavily concentrated, the Mexicans were joined by Oklahomans, who were pitted against one another by the large growers who were intent on keeping expenses low and profits high. The 1930s saw a number of strikes and attempts to unionize farmworkers, and the growers, backed by the California government, did not hesitate to use rough measures to thwart these attempts. Nevertheless, both the state and federal government during this time sought at least to eliminate some of the most egregious conditions faced by farmworkers, especially migrants. The major force behind most of the strikes conducted in California in the early 1930s was the Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union (CAWIU). Because of its ties to the Communist Party, however, it became an easy target for growers who were able to enlist government help in crushing it.\n\nIn 1935 The National Labor Relations Act was passed, granting employees the right to join labor unions. Further attempts were made to unionize California\u2019s migrant workers, but the large number of people seeking these unskilled jobs made it virtually impossible to gain leverage with growers. The situation was turned on its head as the United States prepared for World War II, creating large numbers of jobs in the cities, where the migrants flocked to take factory jobs, or joined or were drafted into the military. As a result, California was short on farm laborers by 1942, the first full year of American involvement in the war. To find help for the fields, a guest worker agreement was reached with Mexico on an informal basis, the infamous bracero system, which only permitted workers to stay in the country until the end of the harvest. A wartime measure at first, the bracero system was codified into law and expanded after the war, especially in California and Texas, and became an effective tool for growers in thwarting the unionizing attempts of domestic farmworkers. Guest workers were not permitted to replace domestic workers, but the law was rarely enforced and bracero workers were often used as strike breakers, further hindering attempts for farmworkers to unionize.\n\nCESAR CHAVEZ BORN IN 1927\n\nOne of those domestic workers was Cesar Chavez. He was born near Yuma, Arizona, in 1927, on his family\u2019s 80-acre farm. During the Depression the farm was lost and the Chavez family moved to California, eventually settling in the San Jose barrio known as Sal Si Puedes. After a stint in the Navy during World War II during which he was assigned the most menial of responsibilities, he returned to the barrio, married in 1948, and began to raise a family, supported by migrant laboring. Extremely religious, Chavez was greatly influenced by an activist priest named Donald McDonnell, who had been assigned to Sal Si Puedes, and took Chavez with him on his visits to bracero camps. McDonnell unlocked the young man\u2019s intellectual curiosity, and although he lacked any formal education beyond the 8th grade, Chavez began to read about Saint Francis of Assisi and Mahatma Gandhi, the biographies of American labor leaders, and political philosophy. It was also McDonnell who told Fred Ross, founder of the Community Service Organization (CSO), a Latino civil rights organization, about Chavez. Ross needed someone to direct a voter registration campaign in Sal Si Puedes for the 1952 election, and despite his initial suspicion, Chavez was won over by Ross and joined CSO.\n\nIn short order Chavez became one of Ross\u2019s key lieutenants, sent to established CSO chapters throughout California. By 1959 he became executive director of the organization. After a decade of work with CSO, Chavez had honed his organizational and leadership skills, and accumulated a wealth of important contacts in the Latino community. By 1962 he was eager to start a farmworkers union under the CSO rubric that could bargain with growers on behalf of its members. Although he had the backing of Ross and the CSO board, the organization\u2019s membership rejected the idea in a vote at the annual meeting because most of the members wanted to focus on urban Latinos, who had left the fields and whose numbers were fast growing. Chavez immediately resigned his position at CSO.\n\nCOMPANY PERSPECTIVES\n\nOur vision: To provide farm workers and other working people with the inspiration and tools to share in society\u2019s bounty.\n\nNow 35 years old, Chavez, who had $1,200 in savings, moved his wife and eight children to Delano, California, in 1962 to begin the task of organizing farmworkers in what he called the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA). More than a union, he envisioned it as a social movement. He was soon joined by a former CSO colleague, Dolores Huerta, and others. The NFWA held its first convention in September 1962, and for the next three years Chavez drove across California signing up members one at a time. It was established enough that in September 1965 the AFL-CIO\u2013affiliated Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), comprised mostly of Filipino Americans, asked for the group\u2019s support after it walked out on strike against Delano-area vineyards. Although Chavez believed NFWA, with a membership of just 1,700 workers, was not yet ready for a major strike, the membership was unanimous in their support for the strike and, prepared or not, NFWA joined the strikers. It would mark the beginning of what became the five-year Delano Grape Strike and Chavez\u2019s rise to international prominence.\n\nShortly after the strike began, Chavez began to urge the public not to buy grapes without a union label, a boycott that by 1967 was extended to cover all California table grapes. Slowly the strikers brought pressure to bear on the growers, as the situation in California received considerable media attention, and Chavez himself became an embodiment of the cause. At a time when the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., was leading the civil rights movement following a nonviolent approach, Chavez assumed a similar place in the Latino community, leading marches, conducting fasts, and inviting arrest to bring attention to La Causa.\n\nIn 1966 NFWA merged with AWOC, to form the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC). As the boycott gained public support growers signed contracts with UFWOC. In September 1970 the grape boycott was called off, but by this time Chavez was leading a boycott against lettuce growers. The organization, part union and part civil rights movement, included 50,000 dues-paying members who enjoyed the benefits of a union-run hiring hall that eliminated abuses of labor contractors, a health clinic, and health plan. A year later UFWOC achieved a major victory when it signed a contract in Florida to cover Minute Maid citrus workers. In that same year it received a charter for the AFL-CIO as the United Farm Workers of America (UFW).\n\nUFW received a major challenge in 1973 when the three-year contracts signed with grape growers in 1970 were set to expire. Instead of renewing with UFW, some of the growers attempted to undermine the union by signing an advantageous deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters without the benefit of elections or any other kind of representative procedure. The two groups vied for dominance until the Teamsters finally gave up the fight in 1977, signing a truce that left the UFW with the sole right to organize farmworkers.\n\nJust two years earlier, in 1975, the union was also buoyed by the passage of the Agricultural Relations Act in California, which established collective bargaining for farmworkers. The UFW appeared to be on the verge of achieving a position of strength with California agribusiness, but in truth 1975 in many ways represented the high-water mark for the union under Chavez. Rather than devoting its resources to organizing workers in the field, the UFW had become enamored with the boycott option, which drew the best of the union\u2019s activists to work in major cities on these efforts. The UFW, as a result, lost touch with the farmworkers, and while the union may have continued to win elections among workers, only about a third of these elections actually led to a union contract. In fact, ten years after the great Delano strike, less than 10 percent of the area\u2019s grapes were harvested by UFW members. Moreover, Chavez became increasingly autocratic. He purged the union, eliminating all non-Hispanic officials, and criticism of him was no longer tolerated.\n\nIn the 1980s, after years of friendly administrations in California, the UFW had to contend with a Republican governor, as well as a Republican president in Ronald Reagan. The deterioration of grassroots support from farmworkers also caught up to the union. Many growers allowed UFW contracts to expire and refused to negotiate new ones, instead turning to labor contractors. The UFW again boycotted table grapes in the mid-1980s, but perhaps because the novelty had worn off, it no longer had the necessary level of public support to force growers to the bargaining table. Chavez also devoted a great deal of his attention to the dangers of pesticide, and neglected organizing efforts in the fields.\n\nKEY DATES\n\n1962: Cesar Chavez forms National Farm Workers Association. 1966: Merger results in United Farm Workers Organizing Committee. 1971: United Farm Workers of America receives AFL-CIO charter. 1975: California passes Agricultural Relations Act. 1993: Chavez dies; is replaced by Arturo Rodriguez. 2000: Long-time grape boycott ends. 2002: California passes binding mediation law.\n\nCHAVEZ DIES: 1993\n\nBy the early 1990s the UFW had only a few contracts left and membership had dwindled to about 10,000. While personally revered and unquestionably devoted to the union, Chavez, unable to share power, was difficult to work with, and many key lieutenants resigned in protest. In April 1993 Chavez died in his sleep at the age of 66. \u201cHe ultimately failed to realize his dream of forging a nationwide organization,\u201d according to his New York Times \u2019 obituary. \u201cIn most of America, farm workers continue to toil for low wages, without job security, vulnerable to exploitation. Even in California he found it difficult to translate the early triumphs of what he called La Causa into a viable labor organization.\u201d\n\nReplacing Chavez as the president of the UFW was his 43-year-old son-in-law, Arturo S. Rodriguez, who had been groomed for the post for the past 20 years. College educated, holding an undergraduate degree from St. Mary\u2019s, San Antonio, and a master\u2019s degree from the University of Michigan, Rodriguez took over an organization undergoing an identity crisis, and one that the growers no doubt hoped would fade away without its charismatic leader. Although unassuming, Rodriguez proved to be a shrewd and effective leader. Rather than taking on the large vineyards and fruit orchards, he concentrated on roses, mushrooms, and other smaller industries. In less than 3 years, the UFW won 13 consecutive elections in California and Washington state, which added about 4,000 members. At the same time, Rodriguez was practical, looking to work with growers in a way that benefited them and the workers. In 1996 he helped to bring to an end a nearly 18-year strike and supermarket boycott against Red Coach lettuce produced by Bruce Church Inc. The fight had begun in 1978 by Chavez and Ted Taylor, the president of Bruce Church. The two sides had fought in the courts for years and when an appeals court denied Bruce Church\u2019s damage award for losses due to the strike, Rodriguez, and Taylor\u2019s son Steve, who succeeded his father after his death, decided that the time for peace had come. With no personal enmity between them, the two men quickly reached a five-year employment agreement.\n\nIn 1996 the UFW launched a major campaign to organize union elections among California\u2019s strawberry workers. According to the Independent on Sunday, \u201cMany workers were living in shacks or caves with no access to clean water, toilets or medical care. Women complained of being forced to perform sexual favours in exchange for employment.\u201d In addition, reported the newspaper, \u201cBecause everyone worked on short-term contracts lasting no more than one season, anybody who tried to complain was simply fired and replaced.\u201d The mere presence of the UFW resulted in some improvements.\n\nThe strawberry growers funded worker committees, which the UFW contended were illegal company unions. In 1999 the UFW and 18 growers reached an agreement to put an end to worker committees. Nevertheless, a short time later a new committee that had never negotiated a contract won an election at Coastal Berry, America\u2019s largest grower and the focal point of the UFW campaign. It was a major setback for the UFW, which had won 18 consecutive elections and rebuilt its membership to 27,000, but now had its momentum blunted.\n\nAs the UFW entered the new century, it was not about to give up on organizing the strawberry workers. In order to focus on this and other organizing efforts and the negotiation of contracts, the union called off its California table grape boycott which had been in effect off and on for 32 years. Rodriguez also wanted to devote more attention to lobby the California state legislature to make changes to the Agricultural Relations Act that would force arbitration settlements when contract negotiations reached an impasse. It would replace a process that had allowed growers to draw out contract negotiations indefinitely. The resulting binding mediation law was signed by the governor in the fall of 2002.\n\nAfter years of struggle, the UFW finally reached an agreement with Coastal Berry in June 2003 on a labor contract that called for a significant increase in wages and piece rate as well as more job security and improved benefits. It was a pivotal win for the union. \u201cWe\u2019ve become a player,\u201d Rodriguez told the press. \u201cWe now have the opportunity to demonstrate to other workers and employers what can be done when we work together to bring about an industry that can be viable to employers and beneficial to workers.\u201d With this major victory in hand, the UFW was able to secure a new contract with Gallo winery in Sonoma, and in 2005 launched a major campaign to unionize Giumarra vineyards, the largest table grape producer in the United States.\n\nEd Dinger\n\nPRINCIPAL OPERATING UNITS\n\nInternet Communications; Political Legislative Office; Recruitment.\n\nPRINCIPAL COMPETITORS\n\nCoalition of Immokalee Workers; Farm Labor Organizing Committee.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\n\u201cAfter Chavez, Farm Union Struggles to Find New Path,\u201d New York Times, July 19, 1993.\n\nBardacke, Frank, \u201cCesar\u2019s Ghost: Decline and Fall of the U.F.W.,\u201d Nation, July 26, 1993, p. 130.\n\n\u201cBlood on the Field,\u201d Independent on Sunday (London), October 11, 1998, p. 26.\n\n\u201cChavez\u2019s Son-in-Law Reviving United Farm Workers but Union Still Faces Many Hurdles,\u201d Seattle Times, March 10, 1996, p.

For those in the industrial sector, organized labor unions fought for better wages, reasonable hours and safer working conditions. The labor movement led efforts to stop child labor, give health benefits and provide aid to workers who were injured or retired.\n\nOrigins of The Labor Movement\n\nThe origins of the labor movement lay in the formative years of the American nation, when a free wage-labor market emerged in the artisan trades late in the colonial period. The earliest recorded strike occurred in 1768 when New York journeymen tailors protested a wage reduction. The formation of the Federal Society of Journeymen Cordwainers (shoemakers) in Philadelphia in 1794 marks the beginning of sustained trade union organization among American workers.\n\nWATCH: The Labor Movement\n\nFrom that time on, local craft unions proliferated in the cities, publishing lists of \u201cprices\u201d for their work, defending their trades against diluted and cheap labor and, increasingly, demanding a shorter workday in the face of the Industrial Revolution. Thus a job-conscious orientation was quick to emerge, and in its wake there followed the key structural elements characterizing American trade unionism. First, with the formation in 1827 of the Mechanics\u2019 Union of Trade Associations in Philadelphia, central labor bodies began uniting craft unions within a single city, and then, with the creation of the International Typographical Union in 1852, national unions began bringing together local unions of the same trade from across the United States and Canada (hence the frequent union designation \u201cinternational\u201d). Although the factory system was springing up during these years, industrial workers played little part in the early trade union development. In the 19th century, trade unionism was mainly a movement of skilled workers.\n\nDid you know? In 2009, 12 percent of American workers belonged to unions.\n\nEarly Labor Unions\n\nThe early labor movement was, however, inspired by more than the immediate job interest of its craft members. It harbored a conception of the just society, deriving from the Ricardian labor theory of value and from the republican ideals of the American Revolution, which fostered social equality, celebrated honest labor, and relied on an independent, virtuous citizenship. The transforming economic changes of industrial capitalism ran counter to labor\u2019s vision. The result, as early labor leaders saw it, was to raise up \u201ctwo distinct classes, the rich and the poor.\u201d Beginning with the workingmen\u2019s parties of the 1830s, the advocates of equal rights mounted a series of reform efforts that spanned the nineteenth century. Most notable were the National Labor Union, launched in 1866, and the Knights of Labor, which reached its zenith in the mid-1880s.\n\nOn their face, these reform movements might have seemed at odds with trade unionism, aiming as they did at the cooperative commonwealth rather than a higher wage, appealing broadly to all \u201cproducers\u201d rather than strictly to wageworkers, and eschewing the trade union reliance on the strike and boycott. But contemporaries saw no contradiction: trade unionism tended to the workers\u2019 immediate needs, labor reform to their higher hopes. The two were held to be strands of a single movement, rooted in a common working-class constituency and to some degree sharing a common leadership. But equally important, they were strands that had to be kept operationally separate and functionally distinct.\n\nPHOTOS: These Appalling Images Exposed Child Labor in America\n\nA young shrimp picker named Manuel, 1912.

Despite its labor reform rhetoric, the Knights of Labor attracted large numbers of workers hoping to improve their immediate conditions. As the Knights carried on strikes and organized along industrial lines, the threatened national trade unions demanded that the group confine itself to its professed labor reform purposes. When it refused, they joined in December 1886 to form the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The new federation marked a break with the past, for it denied to labor reform any further role in the struggles of American workers. In part, the assertion of trade union supremacy stemmed from an undeniable reality. As industrialism matured, labor reform lost its meaning\u2013hence the confusion and ultimate failure of the Knights of Labor. Marxism taught Samuel Gompers and his fellow socialists that trade unionism was the indispensable instrument for preparing the working class for revolution. The founders of the AFL translated this notion into the principle of \u201cpure and simple\u201d unionism: only by self-organization along occupational lines and by a concentration on job-conscious goals would the worker be \u201cfurnished with the weapons which shall secure his industrial emancipation.\u201d\n\nThat class formulation necessarily defined trade unionism as the movement of the entire working class. The AFL asserted as a formal policy that it represented all workers, irrespective of skill, race, religion, nationality or gender. But the national unions that had created the AFL in fact comprised only the skilled trades. Almost at once, therefore, the trade union movement encountered a dilemma: How to square ideological aspirations against contrary institutional realities?\n\nDiscrimination in The Labor Movement\n\nAs sweeping technological change began to undermine the craft system of production, some national unions did move toward an industrial structure, most notably in coal mining and the garment trades. But most craft unions either refused or, as in iron and steel and in meat-packing, failed to organize the less skilled. And since skill lines tended to conform to racial, ethnic and gender divisions, the trade union movement took on a racist and sexist coloration as well. For a short period, the AFL resisted that tendency. But in 1895, unable to launch an interracial machinists\u2019 union of its own, the Federation reversed an earlier principled decision and chartered the whites-only International Association of Machinists. Formally or informally, the color bar thereafter spread throughout the trade union movement. In 1902, blacks made up scarcely 3 percent of total membership, most of them segregated in Jim Crow locals. In the case of women and eastern European immigrants, a similar devolution occurred\u2013welcomed as equals in theory, excluded or segregated in practice. (Only the fate of Asian workers was unproblematic; their rights had never been asserted by the AFL in the first place.)\n\nSamuel Gompers\n\nUnderwood Archives/Getty Image Samuel Gompers.\n\nGompers justified the subordination of principle to organizational reality on the constitutional grounds of \u201ctrade autonomy,\u201d by which each national union was assured the right to regulate its own internal affairs. But the organizational dynamism of the labor movement was in fact located in the national unions. Only as they experienced inner change might the labor movement expand beyond the narrow limits\u2013roughly 10 percent of the labor force\u2013at which it stabilized before World War I.\n\nIn the political realm, the founding doctrine of pure-and-simple unionism meant an arm\u2019s-length relationship to the state and the least possible entanglement in partisan politics. A total separation had, of course, never been seriously contemplated; some objectives, such as immigration restriction, could be achieved only through state action, and the predecessor to the AFL, the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions (1881), had in fact been created to serve as labor\u2019s lobbying arm in Washington. Partly because of the lure of progressive labor legislation, even more in response to increasingly damaging court attacks on the trade unions, political activity quickened after 1900. With the enunciation of Labor\u2019s Bill of Grievances (1906), the AFL laid down a challenge to the major parties. Henceforth it would campaign for its friends and seek the defeat of its enemies.\n\nThis nonpartisan entry into electoral politics, paradoxically, undercut the left-wing advocates of an independent working-class politics. That question had been repeatedly debated within the AFL, first in 1890 over Socialist Labor party representation, then in 1893-1894 over an alliance with the Populist Party and after 1901 over affiliation with the Socialist party of America. Although Gompers prevailed each time, he never found it easy. Now, as labor\u2019s leverage with the major parties began to pay off, Gompers had an effective answer to his critics on the left: the labor movement could not afford to waste its political capital on socialist parties or independent politics. When that nonpartisan strategy failed, as it did in the reaction following World War I, an independent political strategy took hold, first through the robust campaigning of the Conference for Progressive Political Action in 1922, and in 1924 through labor\u2019s endorsement of Robert La Follette on the Progressive ticket. By then, however, the Republican administration was moderating its hard line, evident especially in Herbert Hoover\u2019s efforts to resolve the simmering crises in mining and on the railroads. In response, the trade unions abandoned the Progressive party, retreated to nonpartisanship, and, as their power waned, lapsed into inactivity.\n\nThe Labor Movement and The Great Depression\n\nWATCH: Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal\n\nIt took the Great Depression to knock the labor movement off dead center. The discontent of industrial workers, combined with New Deal collective bargaining legislation, at last brought the great mass production industries within striking distance. When the craft unions stymied the ALF\u2019s organizing efforts, John L. Lewis of the United Mine Workers and his followers broke away in 1935 and formed the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO), which crucially aided the emerging unions in auto, rubber, steel and other basic industries. In 1938 the CIO was formally established as the Congress of Industrial Organizations. By the end of World War II, more than 12 million workers belonged to unions and collective bargaining had taken hold throughout the industrial economy.\n\nIn politics, its enhanced power led the union movement not to a new departure but to a variant on the policy of nonpartisanship. As far back as the Progressive Era, organized labor had been drifting toward the Democratic party, partly because of the latter\u2019s greater programmatic appeal, perhaps even more because of its ethno-cultural basis of support within an increasingly \u201cnew\u201d immigrant working class. With the coming of Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, this incipient alliance solidified, and from 1936 onward the Democratic Party could count on\u2013and came to rely on\u2013the campaigning resources of the labor movement.\n\nCollective Bargaining\n\nThat this alliance partook of the nonpartisan logic of Gompers\u2019s authorship\u2013too much was at stake for organized labor to waste its political capital on third parties\u2013became clear in the unsettled period of the early cold war. Not only did the CIO oppose the Progressive party of 1948, but it expelled the left-wing unions that broke ranks and supported Henry Wallace for the presidency that year.\n\nThe formation of the AFL-CIO in 1955 visibly testified to the powerful continuities persisting through the age of industrial unionism. Above all, the central purpose remained what it had always been\u2013to advance the economic and job interests of the union membership. Collective bargaining performed impressively after World War II, more than tripling weekly earnings in manufacturing between 1945 and 1970, gaining for union workers an unprecedented measure of security against old age, illness and unemployment, and, through contractual protections, greatly strengthening their right to fair treatment at the workplace. But if the benefits were greater and if they went to more people, the basic job-conscious thrust remained intact. Organized labor was still a sectional movement, covering at most only a third of America\u2019s wage earners and inaccessible to those cut off in the low-wage secondary labor market.\n\nWomen and Minorities in the Labor Movement\n\nNothing better captures the uneasy amalgam of old and new in the postwar labor movement than the treatment of minorities and women who flocked in, initially from the mass production industries, but after 1960 from the public and service sectors as well. Labor\u2019s historic commitment to racial and gender equality was thereby much strengthened, but not to the point of challenging the status quo within the labor movement itself. Thus the leadership structure remained largely closed to minorities\u2013as did the skilled jobs that were historically the preserve of white male workers\u2013notoriously so in the construction trades but in the industrial unions as well. Yet the AFL-CIO played a crucial role in the battle for civil rights legislation in 1964-1965. That this legislation might be directed against discriminatory trade union practices was anticipated (and quietly welcomed) by the more progressive labor leaders. But more significant was the meaning they found in championing this kind of reform: the chance to act on the broad ideals of the labor movement. And, so motivated, they deployed labor\u2019s power with great effect in the achievement of John F. Kennedy\u2019s and Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s domestic programs during the 1960s.\n\nDecline in Unions\n\nThis was ultimately economic, not political power, however, and as organized labor\u2019s grip on the industrial sector began to weaken, so did its political capability. From the early 1970s onward, new competitive forces swept through the heavily unionized industries, set off by deregulation in communications and transportation, by industrial restructuring and by an unprecedented onslaught of foreign goods. As oligopolistic and regulated market structures broke down, nonunion competition spurted, concession bargaining became widespread and plant closings decimated union memberships. The once-celebrated National Labor Relations Act increasingly hamstrung the labor movement; an all-out reform campaign to get the law amended failed in 1978. And with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, there came to power an anti-union administration the likes of which had not been seen since the Harding era.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1985, union membership fell by 5 million. In manufacturing, the unionized portion of the labor force dropped below 25 percent, while mining and construction, once labor\u2019s flagship industries, were decimated. Only in the public sector did the unions hold their own. By the end of the 1980s, less than 17 percent of American workers were organized, half the proportion of the early 1950s.\n\nThe labor movement has never been swift to change. But if the new high-tech and service sectors seemed beyond its reach in 1989, so did the mass production industries in 1929. There is a silver lining: Compared to the old AFL, organized labor is today much more diverse and broadly based: In 2018, of the 14.7 million wage and salary workers who were part of a union (compared to 17.7 million in 1983), 25 percent are women and 28 percent are Black.\n\nSources\n\nTED: The Economics Daily.

Fernandez, Sr. was born in Sibonga, Cebu on July 26, 1927 to a prominent clan of landowners. His father, Mateo Fernandez, was a local police constable and his mother, Magdalena Austria, was a housewife. During his grade school years, Rudy was bright and became active in debates and oratorical contests. During World War II (1945\u20131947), the young Fernandez, still in his teens, made use of his expertise in the English language and became the local messenger and interpreter between the American troops and the guerillas who were fighting against the Japanese Occupational forces. Fernandez dreamed of becoming a boxer and left his hometown to join a carnival in the hope of becoming one. He was found and brought home by his father, Mateo, who implored him to finish his studies since it was where he excelled. Also while in his teens, Fernandez joined his older brother Vitaliano Fernandez, a prominent Civil Engineer in Cebu City, to continue his tertiary education at the University of the Visayas. He left the university and migrated to Davao City, Southern Philippines to be with his other brother Ramon Fernandez, Sr. and worked in his stevedoring business to pursue his dream of becoming a lawyer.\n\nFernandez as a 20-year-old university student at IHU c. 1947.\n\nHe studied law at the International Harvardian University (IHU) in Davao City where he met his soon-to-be wife, Antonia Valenton Militante, the local campus belle at that same university and was in her senior year in high school. Fernandez soon became the president of their University's debate team and further improved his skill in speech and argumentation. This flair for discourse in the young Fernandez would be very instrumental in his becoming a skilled Labor organizer. The young Fernandez and Antonia were frequently seen in local clubs and parties and were always the center of these gatherings. Fernandez together with his wit and charm, was also known to be an exceptional dancer. He eventually married Antonia on November 10, 1951. The couple had eleven children named: Matthew, Rodolfo, Jr., Ruby Carmen, Ivan, Hope, Faith, Charity, Strauss, Pearl, Ruth and Rodolfo, III. He became a court stenographer of the local circuit court. His apprenticeship in the Labor movement was honed in the defunct Mindanao Congress of Labor as a labor organizer, then he joined the Philippine Labor Express as a columnist, and also became a radio reporter. Because of his growing family, he soon had to quit college. Fernandez and his wife Antonia separated in 1968. Later, he had two more children, Dean and Lynn, with his common-law wife, Vivian Alvar. Fernandez also became the secretary of then-Congressman Ismael Veloso (NP). Despite his serious years as secretary of Congressman Veloso, Fernandez never lost his devil-may-care attitude. He kept on attending club parties and went on to join club dance showdowns and charmed everyone. It was at this time in his life that Fernandez met and frequently partnered with Nida Blanca, one of Manila's most beautiful women and the queen of the city's club dance showdowns. However, Fernandez\u2019 stint in the Mindanao Congress of Labor urged him to leave Manila and continued to pique his interest in the Labor Movement.\n\nThe labor movement\n\nRudolfo A. \"Rudy\" Fernandez, Sr. eventually became an active Labor organizer in Davao becoming fully aware of the unhealthy and unlawful practices of the local companies and industries towards their workers and employees. Workers and or laborers during those times in Davao were predominantly oblivious of their basic legal rights and how to attain them and companies aware of this fact, were mostly abusing this ignorance. He founded his own labor organization called the Davao Port, General & Transport Worker\u2019s Union (DPGTWU) with the mission of stamping out all forms of oppression against local workers and educate them of their basic legal rights and on organized labor. DPGTWU was then organized and Fernandez was elected as its first president in 1965.\n\nIn 1964, Fernandez\u2019 suffered a massive cardiac arrest and became paralyzed. Most of his relatives, friends and detractors thought he would die. He was confined in the hospital for almost 3 months and was under physical therapy for almost 6 and then gained back his strength to walk again and continue his dauntless efforts as a Labor Leader. Some of his loyal supporters said that Rudy defied death even while already in its brink because of his burning refusal to die. Fernandez\u2019 brush with death, they say, was the turning point of his life. DPGTWU flourished and gained a large union membership in the Lumber Industry (i.e. Santa Clara Lumber Co., Kalinan Timber Corp. of the Consunji Family, etc.), the Food Production and Agricultural Industry (i.e., London Biscuit Co. LONBISCO), and in the local Automotive Industry (i.e., Davao Motor Sales Inc. (DAMOSA), etc. Fernandez gained a reputation of being a tough negotiator in collective bargaining agreements with companies or industries he was dealing with then. He would further become known as a champion of workers in Davao City and was also recognized as a resilient and honest man. He marshaled his union into big companies and industries and was often offered bribes which he refused, by some of their owners so as not to organize a union in their companies. Instead of getting crossed for gaining access in his companies, Don Antonio O. Floirendo, Sr., the owner of the then Davao Motor Sales Corporation (DAMOSA) and Anflocor and one of the richest men in the country, became one of his staunchest ally and friend, and soon further gained his trust and friendship. Don Florendo could not forget Fernandez' quip when he once told him that he is quite good in what he is doing and Fernandez answered him, \"I should be, I worked hard to get to where I am now.\" The former said, Fernandez' remark was uttered without afterthought just as if it was just that, a certainty, so sure of himself. Florendo further related that is how Fernandez instills confidence to people who hears and listen to him: by the firmness of his voice when he talks and that, is a gift of gab. Having gained recognition in the labor movement, he was frequently invited into Davao City\u2019s important occasions and gained the friendship as well as enmity of local politicians, broadcasters and prominent clans because of his often frank and fearless comments against the Marcos dictatorship and the local political scenery. It was during these gatherings that he befriended the country\u2019s future Speaker of the House, Prospero Nograles, Davao City's former Mayor and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary of the Philippines' 11th President Corazon Aquino\u2019s cabinet, Mayor Luis T. Santos and Ernesto Macasaet, Davao City\u2019s Chief of Police, who eventually became a good friend of his. Maintaining his empathy towards the workingmen he had sworn to serve, he was known to offer generous help to them keeping his home constantly open whenever they come to him for food and provide whatever assistance he could give. Due to Fernandez\u2019 open criticisms against the Marcos' dictatorship and his close association with Davao City's local Liberal Party Chapter, his house and residence in Talomo, Davao City was raided by the Military and searched the next day after Marcos declared Martial Law in 1972, with an alleged tip that he was hiding an arsenal of guns. A wildfire of rumors spread in Davao City that he was going to be arrested for illegal possession of firearms or for any other drummed up charges. But, Fernandez using his knack in diplomacy defused the tension that arose at that time and the Military left his residence finding nothing and left him alone to carry on with his labor pursuits.\n\nIn 1973, Fernandez wrote an original oratory, \u201cThe Role of the Youth in the New Society\u201d which was delivered by his second son Rodolfo, Jr., and won second place in the Philippines\u2019 National Oratorical Contest for all Naval ROTC on October 20, 1973 held at the Philippine Navy Headquarters in Manila. The brilliant piece is still kept in the archives of the Philippine Women's University, Manila to this day.\n\nOver the next few years despite Fernandez being a very vocal opponent and his oppositionist leaning, the government supported collective bargaining, and the regulation of the minimum wages and strikes were still allowed although constrained. (QUOTE) DPGTWU flourished and spread and he soon made frequent trips to Manila in order to exchange ideas and ideologies among his fellow labor leaders in the Philippine\u2019s capital city, among them Senator Blas F. Ople, the Secretary of Labor during that time, Democrito T. Mendoza, National President of TUCP-KMP, Ernesto Herrera, Secretary-General of TUCP-KMP, who would soon become a senator in the country, the activist Luis Taruc and Eulogio R. Lerum, Sr., Chief Legal Counsel of TUCP-KMP.[3] The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) was soon organized. It became the labor center to represent labor in the tripartite system of labor relations in the country under the period of labor repression.[4] Fernandez helped organized and established the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP/KMP) and aided, wrote and improved its constitution and by-laws. Fernandez was elected as one of TUCP\u2019s Vice Presidents and was chosen to represent the country as a Labor Observer in Europe in 1976 which was sponsored by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Fernandez, together with his fellow Asian Labor Representatives, visited Yugoslavia and ILO\u2019s main offices in Geneva, Switzerland. Back in the Philippines, despite being swamped with labor work, Fernandez, a Roman Catholic and a known devotee of the Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa (Holy Child of Cebu), never fails to visit the Basilica where it is ensconced. This has been one of Fernandez' generally recognized proclivities and a quirk which he had developed during his later years, wherein he never goes to church in any other place nor province except in the Basilica del Sto. Nino located in Cebu City.\n\nIn April 1978, Fernandez ran as a sectoral assemblyman for the Industrial Labor Sector, Mindanao Region in the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP)\u2019s[5] Philippine parliamentary elections and was a favorite among all the provincial governors of Mindanao to win. He eventually lost to Princess Porti Pacasum of Lanao, Philippines, the daughter of one of its biggest transport companies despite being the favored candidate to win. Fernandez a defeated man became literally old overnight. He was so sure of winning due to the strong support of 90% of the Mindanao governors spearheaded by Gov. Nonito D. Llanos, Sr., then governor of Davao del Sur and their electoral representatives. He suspected that the win was due to vote-buying, a common political strategy in the Philippines\u2019 political setting. Fernandez then decided to file an electoral protest to the Commission on Elections and was quite confident that it will result in his favor. The evening before he was about to file the protest, the then First Lady Imelda Marcos, visited Fernandez who was accompanied by his daughter Faith in Manila, and swayed him not to go through with the protest because it might get the ire of the Muslim population in Mindanao. Since Mindanao is predominantly Muslim, she said it would be best that a Muslim should win. Fernandez suspected that Imelda Marcos wanted Pacasum to win, because Mrs. Marcos was active in the Mindanao Peace efforts at that time and it would look good in her peace efforts. Knowing that the Marcos government is behind Pacasum and realizing their influence, Fernandez didn\u2019t continue filing the election protest and headed back to Davao City a disillusioned man.\n\nFernandez as President of the Rotary Club of Toril, Davao City c. 1977.\n\nIt was during this period in his life that his heart illness became worst. After the IBP elections, Fernandez continued with his unrelenting labor efforts and DPGTWU remained highly regarded and robust. He nonetheless went to another observation trip to the US representing TUCP/KMP in October 1978 upon the sponsorship of the Asian American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI) and toured 14 cities some of which were, Washington, D.C., New York City, and Chicago. The observation trip was cut short when he suffered a pulmonary heart attack in Chicago and was soon flown back to the Philippines by TUCP/KMP after being hospitalized for a brief period there. Meanwhile, during his term as president of DPGTWU, he was also elected as the President of the local Rotary International's District 3860 Toril, Davao City (then a municipality of Davao) in 1977. He further ran for the local Barangay elections in Talomo District, Davao City as Barangay Captain but then lost the seat to a local moneyed favorite.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nFernandez, with his health in decline and defiant of his doctors' wishes continued with his labor efforts and was still active in DPGTWU and TUCP/KMP in late 1978 and early 1979. He felt he was invincible and he never believed that death would overcome him. During a stop-over to Cebu City, in one of his frequent trips and visiting one of his daughters studying in Cebu, he suffered a severe stroke upon disembarking from a plane in Mactan\u2013Cebu International Airport\u2019s tarmac. He was rushed to the nearest Perpetual Succour Hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival (DOA) on June 9, 1979 at 10:00 in the morning. A wake was held in Cebu for most of his relatives there and his body was flown to Davao City to be with his family and children. Buried at the Davao Memorial Park, his burial was attended by Davao\u2019s prominent citizens, some of TUCP-KMP\u2019s officers and his fellow workingmen. He used to say in one of his frequent monologues that he had always wanted to die in his hometown and he got his wish when he died in Cebu City. He left behind 13 children and two wives and a legacy of strength, integrity and wisdom within the Philippine\u2019s labor movement, his family & friends, and his compatriots.\n\nSee also\n\nThe Library of Congress Country Studies; CIA World Fact Book\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/workingmens-party-united-states", "page_content": "Workingmen's Party of the United States\n\nUnited States 1876\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe Workingmen's Party of the United States (WPUS), organized 19-22 July 1876, was the first nationwide socialist organization in the United States.

Eight anarchists are accused and tried; three are imprisoned, one commits suicide, and four are hanged.\n\nEvent and Its Context\n\nThe WPUS formed as the result of the merger of several organizations: the North American remnants of the International Workingmen's Association (Karl Marx was a primary leader of the First International chapter of this group, which had among its members Friedrich Sorge, Carl Speyer, and Otto Weydemeyer); the Social-Democratic Workingmen's Party of North America (which included Adolph Strasser, Peter J. McGuire, George Schilling, Thomas J. Morgan, and Albert Parsons), and two smaller groups, the Workingmen's Party of Illinois and the Social Political Workingmen's Party of Cincinnati. The influence of Marx was obvious within the WPUS, but there were other influences as well, including the ideas of the late German socialist leader, Ferdinand Lassalle, and the analyses and agitation for the eight-hour workday by the U.S. working-class intellectual, Ira Steward.\n\nEthnic Diversity, Class Unity\n\nThe WPUS reflected the fact that the United States was a multicultural \"nation of nations.\" The party had two official weekly German-language papers\u2014the Chicago Verbote (Herald), edited by Conrad Conzett, and the New York Arbeiter-Stimme (Labor's Voice), edited by Otto Walster, to serve the organization's large number of German-American members. (Germans were the largest immigrant group in the U.S. at this time, followed by the Irish.) The party's official English-language weekly, the Labor Standard, was edited by J. P. McDonnell, a former Irish Fenian who later served for a time as secretary to Karl Marx in the First International. At least 21 other newspapers around the U.S. supported the WPUS, of which 12 were German, 7 English-language, 1 Bohemian, and 1 Swedish. In its first year, the WPUS had about 3500 members in 55 sections grouped by nationality: 33 German, 16 English-language, 4 Bohemian, 1 Scandinavian, and 1 French. By the following summer the WPUS had doubled its membership to 7,000, with 82 sections (of which 23 were English-language).\n\nThe WPUS favored working-class unity transcending racial and ethnic divisions. Yet there is evidence of prejudice among some of the members in California toward imported Chinese laborers and in Missouri toward African American workers. Nor was there an appreciation in the organization of the catastrophe wrought by the Republican Party's final betrayal of Reconstruction and black rights in the South. The organization was divided over whether women workers should be organized into trade unions or instead be driven back to their \"rightful place\" in the home, so as not to compete with male labor. On the other hand, the WPUS did have a small number of African American members (most prominently Peter H. Clark of Cincinnati) and women members (generally concentrated in \"women's clubs\" or, in German, frauenverein), and one of its founding documents proclaimed the organization's adherence to \"perfect equality of rights of both sexes.\"\n\nLabor Action, Diverging Perspectives\n\nAnother founding document asserted that \"in this country the ballot box has long ago ceased to record the popular will, and only serves to falsify the same in the hands of professional politicians,\" adding that \"the organization of the working people is not yet far enough developed to overthrow this state of corruptions.\" It concluded that workers should \"abstain from all political movements for the present and to turn their back on the ballot box,\" and should instead concentrate on organizing workers into trade unions to provide a strong basis for future labor politics: \"Let us bide our time! It will come!\" The WPUS would eventually founder on precisely this issue.\n\nThe decisive event in the short life of the WPUS was what has been appropriately tagged \"the great labor uprising of 1877,\" a wave of militant labor insurgencies and street battles that swept through many cities as part of a nationwide strike of railway workers. In many cities, WPUS members apparently played no part in the upsurge, but organized support meetings and rallies in others (most notably in Boston, Cincinnati, Louisville, Newark, New York City, Paterson, San Francisco). In Chicago's general strike WPUS leaders Philip Van Patten, George Schilling, and Albert Parsons were arrested for their efforts to draw the spontaneous outburst into more organized channels. In St. Louis such WPUS stalwarts as Albert Currlin and Peter Lofgreen (who later assumed prominence as a writer under the name Laurence Gronlund) played a central role in a general strike that for a brief period put workers in control of that city, which was then dubbed by the newspapers as \"the St. Louis Commune.\" The result was a flood of new members who were determined to help advance the struggle of labor against capital.\n\nBy 1877 a sharp political divided the WPUS. Some historians have emphasized a so-called Marxist vs. Lassallean conflict in the WPUS. Lassalle had rejected the value of trade union organizing (because the so-called iron law of wages would supposedly prevent working-class gains under capitalism), and called instead for the development of a socialist party that would vote capitalism out of existence. Marx insisted that trade union gains could be made and that such gains would provide experience, organization, and a power base for organizing a successful labor party. The use of \"Marxist\" and \"Lassallean\" labels, however, does not correspond to how the combatants actually identified the divisions. The split had little to do with views on the value of trade unionism but focused instead on whether socialists should also be engaging in socialist election campaigns.\n\nIn the autumn of 1877, the working-class ferment in many U.S. cities encouraged many WPUS sections to run candidates and rewarded them with amazingly high vote totals. In Louisville, the WPUS took 8,850 out of 13,578 votes cast, sending five out of seven candidates to the Kentucky state legislature. Vote totals in other cities: Chicago, 7,000; Cincinnati (where African American socialist Peter Clark ran ahead of the entire ticket) 9,000; Buffalo, 6,000; Milwaukee, 1,500; New York, 1,800; Brooklyn, 1,200; New haven, 1,600; and Detroit, 800. The rush to the ballot box, in contradiction to the WPUS founding documents, led to a split at the end of 1877. A substantial minority\u2014including Friedrich Sorge, Otto Weydemeyer, Carl Speyer, J.P. McDonnell, Adolph Strasser, a young Samuel Gompers, and others\u2014left the WPUS to concentrate on union organizing that began with the International Labor Union and eventually evolved into the American Federation of Labor. The majority renamed the WPUS the Socialistic Labor Party, later simply the Socialist Labor Party (SLP).\n\nSocialist Labor Party\n\nDespite its initial successes, the SLP failed to become a significant electoral force. This failure was accentuated by the counterattack from the two major capitalist parties, Democrats and Republicans (both of which projected themselves as the \"true\" party of labor). It proved especially difficult to compete successfully against another electoral alternative, the Greenback-Labor, whose platform called for monetary reforms, particularly the increase of paper currency to promote better circulation of money, which was conceived as a way to erode the power of financial business interests. In 1878, combining \"greenbackism\" with a variety of other reforms and strongly prolabor rhetoric, the Greenback-Labor Party polled more than a million votes nationwide and elected 14 congressmen.\n\nThe lure of this proved too strong for the SLP, which was led by its national secretary Phillip Van Patten, prominent German-American stalwart Adolph Douai, Peter J. McGuire, and others into the Greenback-Labor presidential campaign of 1880. General James B. Weaver, a Greenback congressman from Iowa, was the presidential candidate. The SLP unsuccessfully backed the eminent life-long U.S. socialist John F. Bray (whose writings were cited favorably in Marx's Capital) for the vice-presidential slot. The socialists' choice was rejected in favor of Texas radical B. J. Chambers, and their distinctive orientation was swamped in the welter of diverse reforms and panaceas. What's more, the wind was going out of the Greenbackers' sails and the national ticket received little more than 300,000 votes.\n\nThis led to another split in 1881, with more revolutionary elements bolting from the SLP to help create the anarchist-influenced International Working People's Association (IWPA), which tended toward a revolutionary antistatist interpretation of Marx's ideas more than toward traditional anarchist theory. The Chicago wing of this organization gained an especially large following and a foothold in the labor movement. IWPA's leaders were at the head of the massive movement for the eight-hour workday on the first May Day, in 1886, but shortly thereafter were victimized and falsely condemned for murder in the wake of the violent Haymarket Affair.\n\nSLP membership dropped below 3000 by 1883, and its demoralized American-born national secretary, Van Patten, abandoned the party in the wake of a personal scandal. A rapid succession of national secretaries (all foreign-born) in the years that followed reflected the party's disarray, although some of its members maintained influence among the larger and more vital Knights of Labor and AFL. In 1886-87, in a major effort to establish its relevance on the U.S. political scene, the SLP allied with various trade union activists and labor reformers (particularly \"single-tax\" advocate Henry George) to run a United Labor Party campaign in various cities. Once again, substantial vote totals in some localities failed to bring victories, and the electoral alliances dissolved. By 1890, hindered by consequent drift and demoralization, the SLP fell under the sway of intellectual Daniel De Leon's rigid interpretation of Marxism, its pre-1890 history of \"fusion and confusion\" being rejected by most remaining party stalwarts. By 1901 some of the SLP's members had broken away to join the new Socialist Party of America, which bypassed the older organization.\n\nKey Players\n\nClark, Peter H. (1829-1925): Grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Before the Civil War Clark was a prominent African American abolitionist and founding member of the Republican Party. He worked as a teacher and had been active in the National Labor Union and in efforts to establish consumer cooperatives. For several years a leading socialist in Cincinnati, he later gravitated to the Democratic Party.\n\nDouai, Adolph (1819-1888): Douai moved to the U.S. after the defeat of the 1848 revolution in Germany. He became an antislavery activist and pioneer of the kindergarten movement, as well as a prominent writer and editor in the socialist movement.\n\nGompers, Samuel (1850-1924): Prominent in the Cigar Makers Union, Gompers became the long-time (1886-1924) and increasingly conservative president of the American Federation of Labor and a spokesman for the \"pure and simple union\" orientation that had been developed initially by his colleague Adolph Strasser. In his later years Gompers became an outright opponent of socialism (though he never lost his admiration for Karl Marx, whose outlook he viewed as consistent with his own \"pure and simple\" unionism).\n\nGronlund, Laurence (1846-1899): Under the name of Peter Lofgreen, Danish-born Gronlund (who worked at various times as a teacher, a clerk, and a journalist) was a leader of the St. Louis WPUS. He was later author of the first substantial popularization of Marxist ideas in the U.S., the 1884 classic The Cooperative Commonwealth. After drifting out of the SLP, he became a leading activist in the Nationalist Clubs initiated by Edward Bellamy, author of the best-selling utopian novel Looking Backward.\n\nMcDonnell, J. P. (1840-1906): An Irish revolutionary, ex-Fenian, and former secretary to Karl Marx in the First International, McDonnell became prominent in socialist and labor politics upon his arrival in the U.S. in the 1870s. He remained editor of the Labor Standard after it disaffiliated from the WPUS, was prominent in various labor reform efforts, and became the leader of the New Jersey Federation of Trades and Labor Unions from its founding in 1883 until his death in 1906.\n\nMcGuire, Peter J. (1852-1906): An American-born worker whose initial involvement in socialist politics was as a member of the First International. McGuire left the SLP in the 1880s to become a founder and general secretary of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and a founder of the AFL. He is often credited for being involved in the creation both of Labor Day (1882) and May Day (1886), although\u2014as with Gompers\u2014his socialist commitments faded with the passage of time.\n\nMorgan, Thomas J. (1847-1912): A stalwart of Chicago socialism for three decades and leading activist in the Machinists union who later secured a law degree. Morgan became a leader of the strong socialist current in the AFL. In 1893 he submitted a political program for adoption by the AFL, calling for an independent labor party based on the unions plus \"the collective ownership by the people of all means of production and distribution.\" The adoption of this platform was prevented only by the strenuous efforts of Samuel Gompers and his allies. Morgan continued to play an important role in the SLP until he left with others to help form the Socialist Party of America.\n\nParsons, Albert (1848-1887): Parsons was a Confederate war veteran in Texas who fell in love with and married a woman of color (Lucy Gonzales, at least partly African American, perhaps also Indian and Mexican). Parsons subsequently became a Radical Republican; with the collapse of Reconstruction in Texas, he fled with his wife to Chicago where they both become active in radical labor activities. Active in the Typographical Workers union, he was blacklisted after 1877 when he became a full-time labor and socialist activist. Editor of the revolutionary paper The Alarm in the 1880s, and a leader of the radical wing of the eight-hour movement, he was victimized as one of the Haymarket martyrs and executed in 1887.\n\nSchilling, George (1850-1938): Initially a cooper by trade, active in socialist politics for many years, Schilling ran for mayor of Chicago on the SLP ticket in 1881. He was involved in the Knights of Labor, the eight-hour movement, and the Chicago Trades and Labor Assembly. He was prominent in the defense of the Haymarket defendants. In the 1890s he become an aide to Democratic Governor John Peter Altgeld (under whom he served as secretary of the Illinois Labor Department), and was active in Chicago's \"single-tax\" club.\n\nSorge, Friedrich (1827-1906): Sorge was a music teacher who emigrated to the United States after the defeat of the 1848 Revolution in Germany. He joined the Communist Club in New York City in 1858, engaged in an extensive correspondence with Marx and Engels, and became a central figure in the North American sections of the International Workingmen's Association (the First International). After its dissolution Sorge became a founder of the WPUS then left it to focus on helping to build the International Labor Union. In the 1890s he wrote a classic history, Labor Movement in the United States, which was serialized in the German Marxist journal Neue Zeit.\n\nStrasser, Adolph (1851-1910): President of the Cigar Makers Union and a founder of the AFL, Strasser shifted sharply away from his socialist orientation in 1883 with the articulation of the \"pure and simple\" union orientation, which rejected \"ultimate ends\" in favor of \"day-to-day\" struggles to attain \"immediate objects\" (higher wages, a shorter work-day, better working conditions) that can be realized in a few years. In later years he left the labor movement to enter the real estate business.\n\nWeydemeyer, Otto: Son of Joseph Weydemeyer (a hero of the1848 Revolution in Germany and of the Civil War in the U.S.), and like his father close to Karl Marx, Otto Weydemeyer was a leading member of the International Workingmen's Association (the First International). He was the first to translate into English portions of Capital, which was initially published as a series of articles in the Labor Standard, then as a pamphlet for U.S. workers.\n\nSee also: American Federation of Labor; Eight-hour Day Movement; First International; Haymarket Riot; Socialist Party of America.\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nAvrich, Paul.

He was one of the original organizers of the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP/KMP) in 1975 and helped draft, develop, and establish its constitution and by-laws. He first came into the Philippine Labor Movement arena when he founded the Davao Port General & Transport Worker\u2019s Union (DPGTWU), now the Association of Trade Unions - TUCP (ATU-TUCP), in Davao City. DPGTWU was one of the most active labor organizations in Davao City and its membership spread throughout Mindanao in the Southern Philippines during the years between 1967-1979. He ran for the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP) in the Philippines in 1978 as an Industrial Labor Sectoral Representative for the Mindanao Region but ultimately lost against his closest rival, Princess Porti Pacasum, daughter of one of the richest Lanao Muslim clans and owner of the biggest transport company in Lanao, Philippines.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nRudolfo A. Fernandez, Sr. was born in Sibonga, Cebu on July 26, 1927 to a prominent clan of landowners. His father, Mateo Fernandez, was a local police constable and his mother, Magdalena Austria, was a housewife. During his grade school years, Rudy was bright and became active in debates and oratorical contests. During World War II (1945\u20131947), the young Fernandez, still in his teens, made use of his expertise in the English language and became the local messenger and interpreter between the American troops and the guerillas who were fighting against the Japanese Occupational forces. Fernandez dreamed of becoming a boxer and left his hometown to join a carnival in the hope of becoming one. He was found and brought home by his father, Mateo, who implored him to finish his studies since it was where he excelled. Also while in his teens, Fernandez joined his older brother Vitaliano Fernandez, a prominent Civil Engineer in Cebu City, to continue his tertiary education at the University of the Visayas. He left the university and migrated to Davao City, Southern Philippines to be with his other brother Ramon Fernandez, Sr. and worked in his stevedoring business to pursue his dream of becoming a lawyer.\n\nHe studied law at the International Harvardian University (IHU) in Davao City where he met his soon-to-be wife, Antonia Valenton Militante, the local campus belle at that same university and was in her senior year in high school. Fernandez soon became the president of their University's debate team and further improved his skill in speech and argumentation. This flair for discourse in the young Fernandez would be very instrumental in his becoming a skilled Labor organizer. The young Fernandez and Antonia were frequently seen in local clubs and parties and were always the center of these gatherings. Fernandez together with his wit and charm, was also known to be an exceptional dancer. He eventually married Antonia on November 10, 1951. The couple had eleven children named: Matthew, Rodolfo, Jr., Ruby Carmen, Ivan, Hope, Faith, Charity, Strauss, Pearl, Ruth and Rodolfo, III. He became a court stenographer of the local circuit court. His apprenticeship in the Labor movement was honed in the defunct Mindanao Congress of Labor as a labor organizer, then he joined the Philippine Labor Express as a columnist, and also became a radio reporter. Because of his growing family, he soon had to quit college. Fernandez and his wife Antonia separated in 1968. Later, he had two more children, Dean and Lynn, with his common-law wife, Vivian Alvar. Fernandez also became the secretary of then-Congressman Ismael Veloso (NP). Despite his serious years as secretary of Congressman Veloso, Fernandez never lost his devil-may-care attitude. He kept on attending club parties and went on to join club dance showdowns and charmed everyone. It was at this time in his life that Fernandez met and frequently partnered with Nida Blanca, one of Manila's most beautiful women and the queen of the city's club dance showdowns. However, Fernandez\u2019 stint in the Mindanao Congress of Labor urged him to leave Manila and continued to pique his interest in the Labor Movement.\n\nThe labor movement\n\nRudolfo A. \"Rudy\" Fernandez, Sr. eventually became an active Labor organizer in Davao becoming fully aware of the unhealthy and unlawful practices of the local companies and industries towards their workers and employees. Workers and or laborers during those times in Davao were predominantly oblivious of their basic legal rights and how to attain them and companies aware of this fact, were mostly abusing this ignorance. He founded his own labor organization called the Davao Port, General & Transport Worker\u2019s Union (DPGTWU) with the mission of stamping out all forms of oppression against local workers and educate them of their basic legal rights and on organized labor. DPGTWU was then organized and Fernandez was elected as its first president in 1965.\n\nIn 1964, Fernandez\u2019 suffered a massive cardiac arrest and became paralyzed. Most of his relatives, friends and detractors thought he would die. He was confined in the hospital for almost 3 months and was under physical therapy for almost 6 and then gained back his strength to walk again and continue his dauntless efforts as a Labor Leader. Some of his loyal supporters said that Rudy defied death even while already in its brink because of his burning refusal to die. Fernandez\u2019 brush with death, they say, was the turning point of his life. DPGTWU flourished and gained a large union membership in the Lumber Industry (i.e. Santa Clara Lumber Co., Kalinan Timber Corp. of the Consunji Family, etc.), the Food Production and Agricultural Industry (i.e., London Biscuit Co. (LONBISCO), and in the local Automotive Industry (i.e., Davao Motor Sales Inc. (DAMOSA), etc. Fernandez gained a reputation of being a tough negotiator in collective bargaining agreements with companies or industries he was dealing with then. He would further become known as a champion of workers in Davao City and was also recognized as a resillient and honest man. He marshaled his union into big companies and industries and was often offered bribes which he refused, by some of their owners so as not to organize a union in their companies. Instead of getting crossed for gaining access in his companies, Don Antonio O. Floirendo, Sr., the owner of the then Davao Motor Sales Corporation (DAMOSA) and Anflocor and one of the richest men in the country, became one of his staunchest ally and friend, and soon further gained his trust and friendship. Don Florendo could not forget Fernandez' quip when he once told him that he is quite good in what he is doing and Fernandez answered him, \"I should be, I worked hard to get to where I am now.\" The former said, Fernandez' remark was uttered without afterthought just as if it was just that, a certainty, so sure of himself. Florendo further related that is how Fernandez instills confidence to people who hears and listen to him: by the firmness of his voice when he talks and that, is a gift of gab. Having gained recognition in the labor movement, he was frequently invited into Davao City\u2019s important occasions and gained the friendship as well as enmity of local politicians, broadcasters and prominent clans because of his often frank and fearless comments against the Marcos dictatorship and the local political scenery. It was during these gatherings that he befriended the country\u2019s future Speaker of the House, Prospero Nograles, Davao City's former Mayor and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary of the Philippines' 11th President Corazon Aquino\u2019s cabinet, Mayor Luis T. Santos and Ernesto Macasaet, Davao City\u2019s Chief of Police, who eventually became a good friend of his. Maintaining his empathy towards the workingmen he had sworn to serve, he was known to offer generous help to them keeping his home constantly open whenever they come to him for food and provide whatever assistance he could give. Due to Fernandez\u2019 open criticisms against the Marcos' dictatorship and his close association with Davao City's local Liberal Party Chapter, his house and residence in Talomo, Davao City was raided by the Military and searched the next day after Marcos declared Martial Law in 1972, with an alleged tip that he was hiding an arsenal of guns. A wildfire of rumors spread in Davao City that he was going to be arrested for illegal possession of firearms or for any other drummed up charges. But, Fernandez using his knack in diplomacy defused the tension that arose at that time and the Military left his residence finding nothing and left him alone to carry on with his labor pursuits.\n\nIn 1973, Fernandez wrote an original oratory, \u201cThe Role of the Youth in the New Society\u201d which was delivered by his second son Rodolfo, Jr., and won second place in the Philippines\u2019 National Oratorical Contest for all Naval ROTC on October 20, 1973 held at the Philippine Navy Headquarters in Manila. The brilliant piece is still kept in the archives of the Philippine Women's University, Manila to this day.\n\nOver the next few years despite Fernandez being a very vocal opponent and his oppositionist leaning, the government supported collective bargaining, and the regulation of the minimum wages and strikes were still allowed although constrained. (QUOTE) DPGTWU flourished and spread and he soon made frequent trips to Manila in order to exchange ideas and ideologies among his fellow labor leaders in the Philippine\u2019s capital city, among them Senator Blas F. Ople, the Secretary of Labor during that time, Democrito T. Mendoza, National President of TUCP-KMP, Ernesto Herrera, Secretary-General of TUCP-KMP, who would soon become a senator in the country, the activist Luis Taruc and Eulogio R. Lerum, Sr., Chief Legal Counsel of TUCP-KMP. The Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP) was soon organized. It became the labor center to represent labor in the tripartite system of labor relations in the country under the period of labor repression. Fernandez helped organized and established the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (TUCP/KMP) and aided, wrote and improved its constitution and by-laws. Fernandez was elected as one of TUCP\u2019s Vice Presidents and was chosen to represent the country as a Labor Observer in Europe in 1976 which was sponsored by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Fernandez, together with his fellow Asian Labor Representatives, visited Yugoslavia and ILO\u2019s main offices in Geneva, Switzerland. Back in the Philippines, despite being swamped with labor work, Fernandez, a Roman Catholic and a known devotee of the Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa (Holy Child of Cebu), never fails to visit the Basilica where it is ensconced. This has been one of Fernandez' generally recognized proclivities and a quirk which he had developed during his later years, wherein he never goes to church in any other place nor province except in the Basilica del Sto. Nino located in Cebu City.\n\nIn April 1978, Fernandez ran as a sectoral assemblyman for the Industrial Labor Sector, Mindanao Region in the Interim Batasang Pambansa (IBP)\u2019s Philippine parliamentary elections and was a favorite among all the provincial governors of Mindanao to win. He eventually lost to Princess Porti Pacasum of Lanao, Philippines, the daughter of one of its biggest transport companies despite being the favored candidate to win. Fernandez a defeated man became literally old overnight. He was so sure of winning due to the strong support of 90% of the Mindanao governors spearheaded by Gov. Nonito D. Llanos, Sr., then governor of Davao del Sur and their electoral representatives. He suspected that the win was due to vote-buying, a common political strategy in the Philippines\u2019 political setting. Fernandez then decided to file an electoral protest to the Commission on Elections and was quite confident that it will result in his favor. The evening before he was about to file the protest, the then First Lady Imelda Marcos, visited Fernandez who was accompanied by his daughter Faith in Manila, and swayed him not to go through with the protest because it might get the ire of the Muslim population in Mindanao. Since Mindanao is predominantly Muslim, she said it would be best that a Muslim should win. Fernandez suspected that Imelda Marcos wanted Pacasum to win, because Mrs. Marcos was active in the Mindanao Peace efforts at that time and it would look good in her peace efforts. Knowing that the Marcos government is behind Pacasum and realizing their influence, Fernandez didn\u2019t continue filing the election protest and headed back to Davao City a disillusioned man.\n\nIt was during this period in his life that his heart illness became worst. After the IBP elections, Fernandez continued with his unrelenting labor efforts and DPGTWU remained highly regarded and robust. He nonetheless went to another observation trip to the US representing TUCP/KMP in October 1978 upon the sponsorship of the Asian American Free Labor Institute (AAFLI) and toured 14 cities some of which were, Washington, D.C., New York City, and Chicago. The observation trip was cut short when he suffered a pulmonary heart attack in Chicago and was soon flown back to the Philippines by TUCP/KMP after being hospitalized for a brief period there. Meanwhile, during his term as president of DPGTWU, he was also elected as the President of the local Rotary International's District 3860 Toril, Davao City (then a municipality of Davao) in 1977. He further ran for the local Barangay elections in Talomo District, Davao City as Barangay Captain but then lost the seat to a local moneyed favorite.\n\nDeath and legacy\n\nFernandez, with his health in decline and defiant of his doctors' wishes continued with his labor efforts and was still active in DPGTWU and TUCP/KMP in late 1978 and early 1979. He felt he was invincible and he never believed that death would overcome him. During a stop-over to Cebu City, in one of his frequent trips and visiting one of his daughters studying in Cebu, he suffered a severe stroke upon disembarking from a plane in Mactan-Cebu International Airport\u2019s tarmac. He was rushed to the nearest Perpetual Succour Hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival (DOA) on June 9, 1979 at 10:00 in the morning. A wake was held in Cebu for most of his relatives there and his body was flown to Davao City to be with his family and children. Buried at the Davao Memorial Park, his burial was attended by Davao\u2019s prominent citizens, some of TUCP-KMP\u2019s officers and his fellow workingmen. He used to say in one of his frequent monologues that he had always wanted to die in his hometown and he got his wish when he died in Cebu City. He left behind 13 children and two wives and a legacy of strength, integrity and wisdom within the Philippine\u2019s labor movement, his family & friends, and his compatriots."}, {"url": "https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-217", "page_content": "The formation of the United Farm Workers (UFW) in , under the leadership of Cesar Chavez, redefined farm labor activism and contributed to a new era of social justice movements in the United States. The union developed after years of struggle and failed attempts to create a permanent union for farm workers. In , the National Farm Labor Union, renamed the National Agricultural Workers Union (NAWU), made an attempt to organize farm workers. Scholar and activist Ernesto Galarza worked on strikes in the Imperial and San Joaquin Valleys of California but struggled to overcome differences in strategy among organizers. In , two organizations, The Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC), composed mainly of Filipinos, and the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA), composed mainly of Mexicans, formed in separate locations in rural California. The two organizations came together in for a strike of grape growers in Delano, California. They formed the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC), with Cesar Chavez as the president. In , the union became affiliated with the AFL-CIO, created a national executive board, and changed their name to the United Farm Workers of America, simply known by their acronym, \u201cUFW.\u201d\n\nCesar Chavez was born in Yuma, Arizona in . The son of sharecroppers, Chavez understood the difficulties of a life in farming. During the Great Depression, the government repossessed his family\u2019s homestead, forcing him and his siblings into the migrant stream of farm laborers that travelled through California in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Chavez met his wife, Helen Favela Chavez, during these trips. She, too, knew rural poverty, having family scattered throughout the many worker colonias (Mexican villages) in the Palo Verde, Imperial, and San Joaquin Valleys. These difficult beginnings inspired Cesar and Helen Chavez to pursue farm worker justice for the rest of their lives.\n\nAs an adolescent, Cesar Chavez exhibited early signs of rebellion, wearing the zoot suit common among disaffected Mexican youth in the 1940s, before entering the U.S. Navy. Following his release from the military, Chavez settled, with Helen, in the urban barrio, Sal Si Puedes (\u201cleave if you can\u201d) in San Jose, California. It was there in that Fred Ross, an organizer for the Saul Alinsky-inspired Community Service Organization (CSO), discovered Cesar Chavez and recruited him. Ross had studied the problems of rural communities in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and he learned that Mexican Americans and agricultural workers experienced the most entrenched forms of discrimination in California. He founded CSO with Mexican American activists and focused his attention on organizing the Mexican communities through house meetings in the barrios and colonias throughout the state. Ross recognized Chavez\u2019s unique ability to reach potential members in these meetings and quickly made him his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Together, they built a strong organization committed to solving the problems of Mexican Americans throughout the state.\n\nChavez recruited a number of skilled organizers into CSO, none more persuasive than Gilbert Padilla, a former onion picker from Hanford, California. Padilla embraced Chavez\u2019s vision for a more organized and politically active Mexican American community. Chavez also discovered a fiery, young single mother from Stockton, California, Dolores Huerta. Huerta channeled her father\u2019s United Mine Workers background and her experience working among Filipino field workers in her mother\u2019s restaurant and hotel business to build an effective strategy for organizing agricultural communities across racial lines. Together, this team moved CSO towards greater advocacy for agricultural workers in rural California. In , Chavez accepted a grant from the Packinghouse Workers of America to study the effects of the bracero program\u2014the bilateral U.S.-Mexican guest worker program begun in \u2014in Oxnard, California. When Chavez became national director of CSO, he assigned Padilla to the CSO service center in Stockton. To Chavez\u2019s delight, Padilla succeeded in securing a grant, in , from the Bishops\u2019 Committee on Migratory Labor in Chicago to study housing conditions for local farm workers.\n\nIn spite of his work and leadership in CSO, Chavez believed the organization lacked sufficient attention to the concerns of agricultural workers and rural communities. Against the advice of Saul Alinsky and Ernesto Galarza, Chavez resigned from CSO on , moved to Delano, California, and began building a new farm worker organization. Ross supported him and offered counsel. Padilla continued to study labor camps, and Huerta remained on staff at CSO until further notice from Chavez. By , Chavez had organized enough local members to convene the first meeting of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in Fresno, California. Padilla joined as a board member, with Chavez as director general. In a short period of time, Chavez reorganized NFWA, making himself president, Padilla first vice president, and Dolores Huerta second vice president. Ross would serve as a special adviser to Chavez over the next three decades.\n\nThe activities of other nonaffiliated activists and organizations assured Chavez that he had chosen the right path. The California Migrant Ministry began work in the San Joaquin Valley during the early 1960s, in part as a response to the activism of religion-oriented groups, such as Southern Christian Leadership Conference, working to end Jim Crow discrimination in the American South during the 1950s. Led by Wayne \u201cChris\u201d Hartmire, a Presbyterian minister, and Jim Drake, a Union Theological Seminary graduate, the California Migrant Ministry assisted local farm workers in the San Joaquin Valley with housing and transportation issues. Chavez counted the Migrant Ministry as an important early ally in his pursuit of farm worker justice.\n\nFilipino leaders shared similar concerns about farm worker conditions and sought remedies through unions. Among Filipino activists, Larry Itliong stood out. Born in San Nicolas, Pangasina, the Philippines, Itliong arrived in the United States in and worked in various crops and industries up and down the West Coast\u2014from harvesting lettuce in California to canning salmon in Alaska. He also served as a labor contractor who maintained constant communication with many of his fellow Filipino migrants. As an affiliate of the Communist Party and a believer in the union movement, Itliong embraced work with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) and pursued justice through this organization. In , he began organizing for AWOC among Filipinos, recruiting a number of exceptionally gifted organizers, including Peter Velasco and Philip Veracruz, who became critical to the success of the United Farm Workers.\n\nThe merging of these movements and the establishment of the UFW began in the rural farming town of Coachella, California in the spring of , when Filipino workers under the banner of AWOC struck grape farms in an effort to increase their hourly wages and improve their living conditions. By , the movement spread to Delano, California in the San Joaquin Valley, where Padilla was working with Hartmire and Drake on farm worker housing issues and Chavez had been slowly building support for NFWA, one house meeting at a time. The decision of Itliong to call a strike of grape fields in Delano forced Chavez to make a decision whether to support the labor action and join forces with AWOC. Padilla played a crucial role in this process by speaking at the AWOC meeting in Filipino Hall in Delano and bringing Mexican farm worker interests to the table. On , Mexican Independence Day, Chavez held a meeting of NFWA in a small church in Delano. Although the strike had not been the preferred plan of action for Chavez, the momentum of the moment, and the rallying cries from rank and file Mexican workers, compelled him to join the fight. The following week, Chavez ordered his followers to picket grape growers alongside workers represented by AWOC, marking the beginning of what is known as the farm workers movement.\n\nDifferences in resources brought AWOC and NFWA closer together. The NFWA did not have a strike fund or permanent home, whereas AWOC had AFL-CIO support and Filipino Hall. The Filipinos relied on Chavez to persuade the majority of the workers who were Mexican to join the movement. The two groups forged a unique, if precarious, alliance that constituted the most serious challenge to the status quo in the San Joaquin Valley since the Cotton Strike of . The audacity of the movement captured the attention of United Auto Worker\u2019s union president, Walter Reuther, who chose to join Chavez, Itliong, and many other strikers in a march in Delano, and committed $10,000 per month to both AWOC and NFWA. Not to be outdone by Reuther, AFL-CIO president, George Meany, sent a representative, Bill Kircher, to fortify their support in the nascent movement. By , Kircher guided a merger of AWOC and NFWA, and brokered an agreement for Chavez to be president and Itliong to be vice president of the union.\n\nThe UFW began with the usual strategies of strikes and marches, but had difficulty winning in the fields. In the early days of the strike, Chavez merged picket signs announcing \u201cla huelga\u201d (the strike) with Christian iconography, such as the Virgin de Guadalupe, that resonated with Mexican workers and inspired them to join the movement. Although controversial for many traditional union leaders, the strategy played well to a public who understood racial discrimination during the Civil Rights Movement underway in the South. This message was most strongly communicated in Chavez\u2019s pilgrimage or peregrinaci\u00f3n from Delano to Sacramento, in the spring of . During the march, farm workers and their advocates carried religious symbols and sang Mexican protest songs in Spanish, while Chavez walked barefoot on highways that wound through farm worker communities. The pilgrimage gathered converts as it progressed and drew media attention to the farm worker struggle.\n\nThe march to Sacramento built support for the movement, but it did not break down the traditional advantage of growers in rural California. Agricultural work moved with the seasons and so did the work site, making it nearly impossible to anchor the movement in any one place. Additionally, whereas most union movements happened in urban, populated areas, the farm worker movement occurred in the countryside, away from the vast majority of citizens and fellow unionized workers who might also serve time on the picket lines. Chavez and the UFW learned how to overcome this problem by taking the fight to the cities in the form of the boycott. In , the union began boycotting the products of growers\u2014most notably wine and spirits\u2014upon the recommendation of Jim Drake. In time, the boycott expanded to table grapes and eventually became the key to the union\u2019s success.\n\nThe appeal to consumers not to buy grapes at North American markets was a major turning point in the movement for farm worker rights. Domestics and farm workers were among a group of U.S. employees denied access to collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of , known as the \u201cWagner Act,\u201d a major piece of legislation during the New Deal. Although the exclusion hurt the ability of farm workers to build unions, it freed them from some of the restrictions in the legislation, namely the ability to boycott. In , the Taft-Hartley Labor Act amended the NLRA to restrict labor unions from running campaigns against companies that were not abusing workers but were selling products of companies that were. In , the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act strengthened the restriction against this practice, which was known as a secondary boycott.1 The secondary boycott remained a viable tool to the excluded farm workers but prevented them from working closely with other unions on such a campaign. These restrictions necessitated shifts in the strategy by UFW organizers on the ground.\n\nChavez and the UFW maneuvered skillfully around these challenges to build a national, and eventually, an international boycott. During the spring of , Dolores Huerta appealed to the Central Labor Council, the Meatcutter\u2019s Union, and the Seafarer\u2019s Union to establish a total blockade of California grapes. The unions agreed to cooperate in time to interrupt the first grapes of the season from making their annual trip across the Hudson River by barge. As the grapes rotted in New Jersey, grape growers filed an injunction against the New York/New Jersey unions for violating federal regulations against secondary boycotts and demanded $25 million in compensation for lost sales. Although the Taft-Hartley Act did not apply to farm workers, it did restrict the Seafarer\u2019s Union from participating in such actions. The Seafarer\u2019s Union eventually released the grapes, but the pause in shipments had reduced the overall number of car lots for to a record low of 91, down from the industry norm of 418.2\n\nBy mid-July, Huerta and the efficient New York City boycott house shifted to consumer action, or the \u201csecondary boycott,\u201d picketing stores throughout the city. Huerta organized against the larger supermarkets in the hopes that an agreement with them would lead to their competitors following suit. In the New York area, the A&P chain dominated the market, which made it the first target for the boycott. Huerta described her strategy in a letter to Delano headquarters: \u201cIn each of the five boroughs, we organized neighborhood coalitions of church, labor, liberal, and student groups. Then we began picketing A&P, the biggest chain in the city. For several months, we had picket lines on about 25 to 30 stores and turned thousands of shoppers away. A lot of the managers had come up through the unions and were very sympathetic to us. In response to consumer pressure, the store managers began to complain to their division heads, and soon they took the grapes out of all of their stores, 430 of them.\u201d3 By knocking off A&P, the richest market chain in the United States, Huerta softened up their competitors\u2014Bohack, Walbaum\u2019s, Hills, and Finast\u2014for the kill. One by one, the stores became the exclusive target of the New York boycott house until all except one\u2014Gristedes, an expensive delivery service market for wealthy clients\u2014stopped selling grapes in the city.\n\nBoycott co-coordinator Jerry Brown, later described this maneuver as the \u201ctactic of the hostage stores\u201d and ordered boycott houses to implement it in cities across North America. According to Brown, Huerta had built strong boycott committees in neighborhoods where union membership was high and volunteers were plentiful, enthusiastic, and committed to stopping the sale of grapes in nearby stores. \u201cOnce [these individual A&P markets] started to capitulate,\u201d Brown explained, \u201c[Dolores] wouldn\u2019t call off the picket lines until they agreed to take [grapes] off the entire division [of A&P markets].\u201d4\n\nBrown demonstrated his prowess as a major tactician and organizer of the boycott. He arrived in Delano in from Cornell University with the intent of writing a dissertation on the farm worker communities. Instead, Chavez re-directed his energy in the service of the union. Within a short period of time, he applied his love of data analysis to the refinement of the boycott.\n\nWorking closely with his wife, Juanita, and a former Catholic priest, LeRoy Chatfield, Jerry Brown made changes that brought the growers to the bargaining table. In , they appealed to Chavez and the leadership for a much more systematic approach to the campaign. First, they argued for an approach that concentrated on building strong boycott houses in ten of the top forty-one cities, where more than 50 percent of California table grapes were sold. Those cities included: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston, Toronto, Detroit, Montr\u00e9al, and Cleveland. They replaced the anecdotal reports for judging the success of the boycott with a clear and measurable goal of reducing shipments in every city by 10 percent or more over totals.5 Although growers had begun to show signs of redirecting shipments elsewhere to soften the blow of the boycott, Brown and Chatfield calculated that such a shift could not make up for the substantial losses in growers\u2019 traditional markets. As growers sent grapes to other ports, Jerry and Juanita Brown responded by working with volunteers in those cities to open up new boycott houses.\n\nThe game plan prepared by Jerry Brown and LeRoy Chatfield produced results as boycotters returned to houses across the country for the remainder of the season and through the harvest. In Toronto, the mayor declared as \u201cGrape Day\u201d and announced the city government\u2019s decision not to buy grapes in recognition of the farmworkers\u2019 struggle. In Chicago, Eliseo Medina organized a boycott campaign that persuaded the leading supermarket chain, Jewel, to stop carrying table grapes at every one of its 254 store locations. Similarly, in Cleveland, Mayor Carl Burton Stokes, the first African American to be elected mayor of a major U.S. city, ordered all government facilities to cease serving table grapes. Mack Lyons, the only African American on the National Executive Board of the UFW, made the appeal to Stokes and organized one of the strongest boycott houses in the network. In San Francisco, five major agribusiness organizations cancelled their annual meetings in the city in response to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors\u2019 endorsement of the boycott.6\n\nIn a final, desperate attempt to outrun the boycott, growers redirected their shipments to Europe. There, Brown drew on the creativity of Elaine Elinson, a veteran of the New York City boycott house, who had moved to England to study Chinese history but was unhappy with her decision. When she wrote Brown in Delano to see if she could come back to the United States to work for the union, Brown instructed her to remain in England. \u201cIf necessary you could come back right away,\u201d Brown responded to Elinson, but added, \u201cin as much as you are in London and we are trying to internationalize the boycott, Cesar asked if you couldn\u2019t hold on to your means of existence and do some ground work for us there.\u201d7\n\nLike Huerta before her, Elinson adapted to the environment around her. Elinson quickly figured out that social justice for farm workers could flow more easily through the collective action of unionized laborers. Unlike in North America, where labor laws restricted allied unions from helping the UFW execute a blockade of shipments, unions in the United Kingdom had greater freedom to assist other workers. British labor leaders and union officials were particularly scandalized by the denial of collective bargaining rights to farm workers. Rather than pursue a consumer boycott, Elinson shifted to working with a powerful British union, the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU), to block (or \u201cblack\u201d) California table grapes. She described how it unfolded on the River Thames: \u201cWith the bill lading in hand, I went down to the London docks with Brian [Nicholson]. We would approach the team of dockworkers working on that particular ship and that particular hold. The workers would put down their ominous looking dockers\u2019 hooks (a pointed piece of iron attached to a strong wooden grip, used to pull cargo off ships before containerization) and gather round this odd pair. Brian, a third-generation dockworker, 6\u20193,\u201d in a thick sheepskin coat and cloth cap, orange sideburns, and a booming Cockney voice, would introduce me. I came up to his shoulder, had a ponytail and big mod glasses. They could hardly understand my American accent. We both wore red-and-black UFW buttons on our jackets.\u201d8 This same scene played out in Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Unable to unload the \u201cblacked\u201d grapes anywhere in Europe, they were finally left to rot on a dock in Hamburg, Germany in late . By , the growers conceded defeat. The boycott drove twenty-six of them to the bargaining table, where they finally signed collective bargaining contracts with the UFW that ended the five-year-long Delano grape strike.9\n\nThe first few years after the historic contracts in were difficult ones, marred by competition from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union to represent farm workers. The Teamsters set their sights on representing lettuce workers in Salinas, California by negotiating \u201csweetheart contracts\u201d with growers without consulting workers. Although the UFW fought off the threat initially, the Teamsters continued to pursue the matter, including with grape workers in , when the initial contracts came up for renewal in the San Joaquin and Coachella Valleys. Through outright physical intimidation, the Teamsters declared war on the United Farm Workers, attempting to beat UFW representatives out of the fields. The extreme violence exhibited by the Teamsters precipitated retaliation from UFW supporters. In an attempt to quell the conflict and claim the moral higher ground, Chavez engaged in a hunger strike, converting his followers\u2019 ire for the Teamsters into concern for his health.\n\nChavez\u2019s strategy of nonviolence, borrowed directly from Mahatma Gandhi, worked to calm the passions of his followers but failed to stem the loss of members and the shift of momentum away from UFW. At the peak of employment in , the UFW boasted 60,000 members; however, loss of contracts to the Teamsters dropped membership down to 12,000 by the end of the harvest. By the winter of , the Teamsters cut UFW membership in half, to 6,000. The loss of members reduced dues, thereby cutting into the economic viability of the union. These struggles, and pressure from AFL-CIO president, George Meany, forced Chavez to sue for peace under a new state law\u2014the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act\u2014that promised to curb violence in the fields by holding elections and resolving unfair labor practices through the Agricultural Labor Relations Board (ALRB).\n\nThe United Farm Workers won the right to bargain collectively through the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act (ALRA) in , a law that Governor Jerry Brown called \u201cthe greatest accomplishment of my administration.\u201d10 ALRA mirrored the NRLA and was implemented, in part, by members of the NLRB who came to California to see farm worker justice take off. Holding free and fair elections for representation in the fields and adjudicating unfair labor practice charges were two of the primary duties of the ALRB.\n\nALRA transformed the movement and Chavez. During its implementation, UFW\u2019s threats to boycott the ALRB and pressure from UFW\u2019s chief legal counsel, Jerry Cohen, helped the union win far more elections than it lost. By the end of , ALRB had held 354 elections; of these, the UFW scored victories in 189 of them, representing 26,956 workers, or 50.2 percent of voters. The Teamsters, by comparison, won 101 elections representing 12,284 workers, or 23 percent. While the union did not like to lose any workers, the UFW took solace in the fact that, in elections on fifty-eight ranches, 8,228 workers switched allegiances from the Teamsters to the UFW. Only 4 percent of workers voted for no representation.11\n\nJerry Cohen used these numbers to persuade the Teamsters to reach a settlement. After years of mayhem in the fields and numerous courtroom battles, the UFW and Teamsters met on , to agree to a moratorium on filing suits against one another. On , Cohen facilitated a meeting of Cesar Chavez and Teamster President Frank Fitzsimmons to sign a jurisdictional pact that recognized the right of the Teamsters to organize truck drivers, cannery workers, and other non-field workers, while UFW had exclusive rights to organize farm workers. The pact ended a six-year war between the unions and opened up the possibility for the UFW to take advantage of future union elections under ALRA.12\n\nIn spite of this success, the UFW struggled to work within the law. Problems existed from the start. After the first six months of its existence, the ALRB exhausted its budget and had to close down operations. In an attempt to protect funding for the future, Chavez pursued a risky strategy of appealing to voters to pass Proposition 14, an initiative that would have insured funding for all the work ALRB needed to do within a year. Chavez added the demand for greater union access to workers on farms, a provision that went against attitudes towards private property in California and the West. Proposition 14 went down in defeat by a 3:2 margin, costing the union $1.3 million and significant political clout. Nevertheless, the ALRB received funding the following fiscal year, in ; with it came continued opportunities for the UFW to win more elections.\n\nChavez\u2019s lack of faith in the strategy of state-sponsored collective bargaining further hindered progress under ALRA. He was not entirely alone among union leaders in his skepticism about the law. Eliseo Medina, a member of the Executive Board and one of the most skilled organizers, quipped in , \u201cWe ought to go to the Legislature and get\u2019em to repeal the ALRA and go back to the boycott!\u201d13 Crosby Milne, a management consultant for the union, shared, \u201cwe\u2019re being managed by the law.\u201d These sentiments supported Chavez\u2019s own notion that \u201cthe law had changed us completely,\u201d by which he meant, ALRA \u201chas become the center of power\u201d within the movement.14 For Medina, Milne, Chavez and others, the law made the labor of the movement more legal-bound and incumbent upon UFW attorneys to work out settlements with Teamster and grower lawyers or state officials. Under the law, the union\u2019s success became less a function of the \u201cmissionary work\u201d of appealing to consumers and workers to support la causa.15\n\nAlthough many union members lamented the change in strategy, no one resisted it more than Chavez. Eliseo Medina, for example, threw himself into organizing citrus workers and winning elections, striving to reach 100,000 members by the end of . Similarly, Marshall Ganz, a successful leader of the Toronto boycott, had worked with lettuce workers in the Imperial and Salinas Valleys and was committed to growing the union\u2019s ranks in these industries. Chavez, on the other hand, questioned the value of a union, and articulated a preference for organizing the poor and building a commune at the union headquarters, La Paz. Chavez envisioned the community looking much like those present at Synanon, a drug rehabilitation center that had become a religion under Chavez\u2019s friend, Chuck Dederich. In , he told the Executive Board, \u201cNo sooner than we will have it built than we\u2019re going to be faced with other forms of poverty \u2026 with mechanization and things coming up, it\u2019s going to be a small percentage of workers working, very well paid, a large majority of people in the rural areas still poor, you know, former farm workers, the rural poor. The way for me to go is to have a community like Synanon or close to that and start truly cooperative ventures. In other words, we start taking over the land.\u201d16\n\nIn the months following this meeting, Chavez appealed to the Executive Board to support the implementation of a controversial group encounter exercise, The Game, practiced at Synanon. The Game subjected members to harsh interrogations from peers, and sometimes Chavez, to achieve greater conformity to the leader. The practice began with a small group of younger members, including Chavez\u2019s son, Paul \u201cBabo\u201d Chavez and Dolores Huerta\u2019s daughter, Lori Huerta. The group met and played the Game at Synanon\u2019s headquarters, Home Place, in Badger, California, before moving to La Paz. Chavez eventually demanded that everyone at La Paz play The Game, though several members resisted. Outside of La Paz, staff members and volunteers working in boycott houses around the country questioned the practice and wrote letters of opposition to Chavez. When Chuck Dederich fell into trouble with the law after plotting to kill a lawyer who sued him for the mistreatment of children at Synanon, Chavez defend him. Ultimately, his association with Dederich and his experimentation with The Game damaged the esprit de corps within the movement and produced questions about his vision for the union. He responded to his critics by cancelling the boycott and purging members from the union.\n\nOther factors contributed to the weakened state of the union in the 1970s. The actions of the Teamsters created the perception that the fight for labor rights was between two unions rather than against the practices of farm owners. The confusion made it difficult for consumers to choose sides and follow the various boycotts. Some critics of the union also believed that the move of union headquarters in , from Delano to La Paz in the foothills of the Tehachapi Mountains, contributed to Chavez\u2019s alienation from the rank and file. During the mid- to late 1970s, Chavez travelled to the field offices less frequently and focused a greater portion of his attention to building a community. When Chavez accepted an invitation from President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, several current and former members argued that he had lost touch with those who had supported him, especially Filipino members. He ignored the counsel of Gilbert Padilla, who advised him not to go. When Filipinos and Catholic supporters of the union faulted him for supporting Marcos, who opposed labor unions and practiced martial law in his country, Chavez refused to admit his mistake and pushed harder against his critics. The action upset many Filipinos within the union who challenged him from the floor of the UFW convention. Many left the union altogether. The controversy earned Chavez condemnation from the National Council of Churches and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, as well as criticism within the Filipino, radical, and popular press.17\n\nChavez\u2019s opposition to the creation of local chapters within UFW did not sit well with some members who had created \u201cranch committees.\u201d The ranch committees elected representatives and possessed their own ideas about strategy for pursuing justice on the farms they worked. This conflict came to a head in Salinas, when vegetable workers defied Chavez\u2019s wishes to pursue a boycott and declared a strike. The workers won the battle in , and Jerry Cohen negotiated the contracts with the growers, but Chavez refused to celebrate the victory with the workers.18 When these same workers tried to elect members to the UFW Executive Board at the union convention, Chavez expelled them from the floor and changed the rules unilaterally to block their election. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Chavez accused many of his most loyal members of treason, for their willingness to criticize him or express new ideas. These people included Gilbert Padilla, Chris Hartmire, Eliseo Medina, and Marshall Ganz, all key members who played a critical role in building the United Farm Workers.\n\nUltimately, Chavez and the UFW struggled with the transitions from being a social movement in the 1960s to a union responsible to members in the 1970s. Once it succeeded in drawing growers to the bargaining table, the union was forced into a process of professionalization by competing unions (The Teamsters) and grower expectations. Whereas other unions paid organizers to recruit workers, win elections, manage the hiring process, and negotiate contracts, the United Farm Workers depended on a volunteer system and a compensation structure that paid even the best organizers only $10 per week plus room and board.\n\nIn , the UFW lawyers\u2014who received $600 per month\u2014requested more for their services. Chavez refused to budge, demanding instead that they remain \u201cvolunteers,\u201d with a compensation structure far below the market rate. He also insisted that they play the Game. The lawyers accepted neither, leading to a break up between Cohen and Chavez, and a housecleaning of the legal department that compromised the union\u2019s ability to work within the ALRA.19 The dismantling of the organizing and management team also occurred elsewhere in the union, due in part to some of the same issues of poor compensation and Chavez\u2019s coercion.\n\nProblems in the organization notwithstanding, Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers delivered a degree of justice to farm workers and their families never before seen in California or the United States. Prior to the farm worker movement, unions used the boycott to create class solidarity by asking fellow laborers not to purchase a particular product linked to the unfair treatment of workers. Chavez and the UFW expanded the use of the boycott by appealing to an international public to participate on the grounds of achieving social justice rather than just labor solidarity. He attracted attention to the injustices of a farm labor system that employed mostly Mexican and Filipino laborers in hopes of capitalizing on a heightened civil rights consciousness in the nation. Indeed, at the height of the movement, Chavez counted Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert Kennedy, and numerous civil rights leaders as allies and advocates for his cause. His long marches in the San Joaquin Valley, fasts for calm in California and Arizona, and his speeches in urban California built a connection between the conditions of farm laborers in the fields and the buying habits of consumers in the city. To the surprise of his critics, his tactics mostly succeeded in winning over the public. The success of the boycott paved the way for contracts and legislation that, prior to the 1960s, no one thought possible. The boycott continues to shape the labor actions of current farm worker groups such as the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, who have appealed to consumers to call for an additional \u201cpenny-per-pound\u201d of tomatoes sold in supermarkets and used in restaurants, so that workers can monitor labor conditions on Florida farms.20\n\nChavez and the UFW contributed to a more general movement, known as the Chicano movement, for civil rights among Mexican Americans, during the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to the land grant movement led by Reies L\u00f3pez Tijerina in New Mexico to reclaim property lost by Hispanos after the U.S.-Mexican War, the UFW inspired a new generation of urban Mexican American youths to organize their communities and peers. Chavez was a role model for this generation of Mexican Americans, although his opposition to illegal immigration occasionally landed him on the wrong side of college-educated Mexican Americans who began to question this policy. Chavez eventually withdrew his public opposition to undocumented immigrants but never embraced the idea that organizing them would benefit farm worker justice.21\n\nCesar Chavez died on , in Arizona. He continues to be an icon of the civil right movement, with his image gracing a U.S. postage stamp, his name can be found on streets and buildings through the country, and movies and books are dedicated to telling his story. President Barack Obama used the UFW rallying cry\u2014Si, Se Puede/Yes, We Can\u2014for his election, and honored Chavez and the United Farm Workers during his re-election campaign in by making La Paz a National Park."}, {"url": "https://time.com/5909191/these-latinas-were-pioneers-for-workers-rights-in-the-u-s-here-are-2-you-should-have-learned-about-in-school/", "page_content": "When news outlets projected Joe Biden would win Arizona\u2019s 11 electoral votes in the 2020 Presidential election, people were quick to thank Cindy McCain, the widow of the late U.S. Sen. John McCain, who endorsed the former Vice President.\n\nHowever, activists quickly pointed out that Latina grassroots organizers deserve credit for Biden\u2019s win. They knocked on doors overlooked by party officials, helped Latino households register to vote and hosted community meetings. Led in part by Alejandra Gomez, they were continuing a decade-long effort that, in partnership with labor movement organizers like Neidi Dominguez, ousted Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio in 2016 after a 24-year tenure known for raiding neighborhoods and workplaces for illegal immigrants.\n\nAnd yet, the history of Latina organizers mobilizing their communities is even longer. American history education tends to describe the Latino population as a monolith, but they have long played a key role in advancing the causes of fairer wages and humane working conditions that has benefited people from all racial and ethnic groups.\n\nDiscussion of the labor movement in textbooks has historically focused on the white union leaders and white immigrants. If any Latino individuals are spotlighted, the farm worker organizers of the 1960s like Cesar Chavez are the ones most often acknowledged. Other than a brief mention of Dolores Huerta, textbooks historically haven\u2019t spotlighted the roles of other Latina women in the U.S. labor movement. For example, less attention is paid to Cesar\u2019s wife Helen Chavez, whose critical work behind the scenes helped pave a way for Mexican American economic upward mobility.\n\nBut Latinas were active in the labor movement nearly three decades earlier, and that work is not taught as often in schools. In the above video, historians Sandra I. Enr\u00edquez, an Assistant Professor of History at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, and Lindsey Passenger Wieck, an Assistant Professor of History at St. Mary\u2019s University in San Antonio, Texas, spotlight two Latina activists to know about.\n\nFor example, Emma Tenayuca, an organizer in San Antonio, Texas, in the 1930s and 1940s, had her political awakening in high school during the Great Depression. Back then, many Mexican and Mexican American workers, who had fled to San Antonio after the Mexican Revolution of the 1910s, were excluded from the New Deal\u2019s jobs and housing programs. A reduced need for agricultural workers during the Great Depression, combined with fears that they were stealing U.S. jobs, led to a massive deportation of Mexican and Mexican-American workers. Tenayuca organized protests against the abuses that Mexican immigrants were facing at the hands of the border patrol. Her demonstrations landed her in jail countless times, earning the nickname \u201cLa Pasionaria de Texas\u201d or \u201cThe Passionate One.\u201d\n\nOn January 31, 1938, nearly 12,000 pecan shellers in San Antonio walked off the job to protest inhumane working conditions and wage cuts. They unanimously elected Tenayuca as the leader of what became one of the biggest labor strikes in U.S. history. In San Antonio, a center for pecan shelling, workers at around 150 factories were known for shelling 21 million pounds of pecans a year, but only earned between 30 cents and $1.50 a day. Strikers withstood tear gas and billy clubs for about six weeks, and TIME ran a photo of 21-year-old Tenayuca, describing her as at \u201cthe forefront of most of its civil commotions.\u201d The workers got a wage increase after the strike, but mechanization of the process ended up eliminating many laborers\u2019 jobs.\n\nHistorians say Tenayuca\u2019s resilience and the impact she had at such a young age, provide a teachable moment for young people looking to find a way to make a difference in their communities. Often students of color \u201cnever see themselves reflected in history books,\u201d says Enr\u00edquez. \u201cLearning the history of Emma Tenayuca provides a window to see this is what the power of the youth can do.\u201d\n\nThe same year that Emma Tenayuca was organizing pecan shellers in 1938, Luisa Moreno helped found the National Congress of Spanish-Speaking Peoples, which fought for fair treatment of Latino laborers and against segregation in public places, schools and housing. Moreno, a journalist and activist who went advocating for women to be admitted to the country\u2019s universities in her native Guatemala, to criss-crossing the U.S. organizing all kinds of workers, such as garment district workers in New York City, cane workers in New Orleans, tuna packing workers in San Diego, and cigar rollers in Florida. In each city, she built multiracial coalitions to build solidarity among workers, informed them of their rights and how to call out injustices. She became an international representative of the United Cannery Agricultural Packing and Allied Workers of America, the first CIO local where Mexican women made up a majority of membership, and she was one of the first Latina American Federation of Labor organizers. Her 1940 speech, known as the Caravans of Sorrow speech, is still relevant today.\n\n\u201cThese people are not aliens,\u201d Moreno said in the speech. \u201cThey have contributed their endurance, sacrifices, youth, and labor to the Southwest. Indirectly, they have paid more taxes than all the stockholders of California\u2019s industrialized agriculture, the sugar beet companies and the large cotton interests that operate or have operated with the labor of Mexican workers.\u201d\n\nAs Wieck explains Moreno\u2019s significance, \u201cWe think of the Latino labor movement as really starting to catalyze [later in the 20th Century] with the United Farmworkers, but she\u2019s out there doing this work twenty years earlier, which helped pave the way for these movements that came later.\u201d\n\nOne reason Latina labor organizers haven\u2019t been widely mentioned in history textbooks is because of mid-20th century red-baiting, a national effort to label minority groups as Communist and therefore anti-American. In that 1938 TIME article, the magazine called Tenayuca, \u201ca slim, vivacious labor organizer with black eyes and a Red philosophy.\u201d Moreno faced deportation in the 1940s because she had been a member of the Communist party at one point. But as she said at a Naturalization Services hearing, \u201cThey can talk about deporting me\u2026but they can never deport the people that I\u2019ve worked with and with whom things were accomplished for the benefit of hundreds of thousands of workers.\u201d She left the country voluntarily in 1950.\n\nThe ideas and values that Moreno and Tenayuca championed are being carried on by today\u2019s labor organizers fighting for farmworkers\u2018 rights, immigration rights, a higher minimum wage and the rights of the predominantly Latino workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. As awareness grows of Latinas in labor movement history, the more all Americans will be able to better understand where the growing Latino political power is coming from in the U.S. It\u2019s especially important at a time when Latino voters were already projected to make-up the largest nonwhite voting bloc in the 2020 presidential election. The Hispanic population hit a record 60.6 million in the U.S. in 2019, and Latinos are the second-largest racial group in the U.S. after white non-Hispanics.More than ever, it\u2019s important to learn the history of their contributions to America.\n\nWrite to Olivia B.

Although many features of that revolution proved short-lived, the mobilization left a lasting imprint on national industrial relations policies, managerial approaches to employee relations, the labor movement, and rank-and-file union members. Among the issues the war years highlighted, the most important centered on the cost of living, workplace control, collective bargaining, the role of the state in labor relations, and what kind of unions would find their ways into the halls of national power. The last of these issues was no small matter as the pre-war labor movement in the United States included moderate trade unionists, socialists, and syndicalists, all of whom contended uneasily with one another. The single most important feature of the mobilization, the expanded reach of the state into society, favored the moderate AFL unions at the expense of the revolutionary Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). This expansion of state interest and union growth occurred in the context of a multi-year strike wave lasting from 1915 to 1922 that demonstrated the insurgent quality of the era\u2019s labor conflict and workers\u2019 sense that the war offered possibilities to improve their lot.[1]\n\nPolitics and Labor Conflict during the Neutrality Period, 1914-1916 \u2191\n\nFor the first two and a half years of the war, the United States hewed to a policy of neutrality, setting the experience of the American labor movement and the pattern of labor conflict apart from those of other belligerents. Nevertheless, the war in Europe altered the terrain upon which workers, employers, unions, and the state engaged each other in ways that echoed what was happening in Europe. Two factors assumed particular importance. First, the avalanche of overseas orders for manufactured goods in late 1914 combined with the halt of mass European immigration tightened the American labor market, reversing a decade-long employer offensive against trade unionism. These developments encouraged workers to become more militant and unions more aggressive by early 1915. Second, as American involvement in the war became more likely, national policymakers realized that the extent of mobilization required for a total war meant they needed workers and their unions on-side.[2]\n\nThese developments took place against the Progressive Era backdrop of increased state involvement in labor relations and organized labor\u2019s tightening alliance with the Woodrow Wilson (1856-1924) administration and the Democratic Party. In 1912, that alliance delivered to the White House the most labor-sympathetic chief executive in American history to date.[3] Although political realities motivated Wilson\u2019s accommodation of labor, so too did escalating labor conflict brought on by the war-infused economy, which ended the short but sharp economic contraction of 1913-1915. Tighter labor markets and the escalating cost of living drove workers to change jobs with increasing frequency, and the quest for higher wages and better working conditions encouraged many to join unions. This volatility fed industrial action, with the 3,789 recorded strikes of 1916 more than doubling the figure of 1,593 for 1915, a historic high.[4]\n\nThe strike wave of 1915-1916 further drew the federal government into labor-management relations and established the basic parameters of what would become the Wilson administration\u2019s wartime labor policy, beginning with the U.S. Commission on Industrial Relations. The Commission took testimony from around the country on the causes of industrial conflict and industrial violence. Its final majority report condemned wealth inequality, unemployment, and poor working conditions and called upon the federal government to extend \u201cthe principles of democracy to industry.\u201d For the Commission\u2019s co-chairman Frank Walsh (1864-1939), workers\u2019 self-organization and collective bargaining offered the best bet for achieving the compelling, but never fully defined, goal of industrial democracy.[5]\n\nLabor Politics and Wartime Mobilization, 1917-1918 \u2191\n\nThe United States\u2019 entrance into the war on 6 April 1917 brought with it another surge in labor conflict. In the six months between April and October alone, American workers went on strike over 3,000 times. The pattern of these strikes changed, too, with at least sixty-seven of them involving over 10,000 workers each. Metalworkers led in terms of numbers of workers and workdays lost, with shipbuilding, coal and copper mining, textiles, lumber, clothing, and transport following up. Longshoremen, loggers, packinghouse workers, miners, grain harvesters, urban transport workers, and service sector workers joined craftsmen, all contributed to the turmoil. Pre-intervention drivers of labor conflict\u2014inflation and full employment, together with the long-term dilution of crafts (e.g., metalworking) and the consolidation of working-class neighborhoods\u2014intensified under the pressures of mobilization to upset customary standards of earnings, making wage battles chronic and triggering working-class consumer struggles over the high cost of housing and food. And congested working-class neighborhoods, many of them heavily immigrant, fostered the kinds of worker solidarity that drove a series of sympathetic general strikes across 1917-1918 in Springfield, Illinois; Kansas City, Missouri; Waco, Texas; and Billings, Montana.[6] At the same time, the influx of women and southern African-American migrants into northern industry created tensions and conflicts within workplaces and working-class communities. The East St. Louis race riot of July 1917, brought on in part by these pressures, stands as one of the worst episode of racial violence in United States history, matched only by the series of race riots that swept the nation during the \u201cred summer\u201d of 1919.\n\nThe labor upheaval drew the federal government even further into labor management relations. Building on prewar precedent, mobilization created a national state apparatus with unprecedented reach into American society. Two broad principles guided policymaking. First, the administration sought the cooperation of existing \u201cresponsible\u201d unions. Second, it expected both labor and management to refrain from taking advantage of the war emergency to \u201cchange existing standards.\u201d The first of these principles proceeded naturally from the closer relationship between the AFL and the Democratic Party. During the summer of 1916, Wilson had appointed Samuel Gompers to the Advisory Council on Labor of the Council on National Defense. Gompers, for his part, readily pledged no strikes for the war\u2019s duration. Additionally, the AFL supplied union representatives to mobilization agencies and worked with those agencies to prevent strikes. Moreover, the AFL sponsored the American Alliance for Labor and Democracy to enlist working people on behalf of the war effort.[7] In sectors critical to war production, the government took a corporatist approach. The Emergency Fleet Corporation, created in April 1917 to coordinate shipbuilding, joined with the AFL\u2019s Metal Trades Department to create the Shipbuilding Labor Adjustment Board to adjust grievances. Similarly, the United States Railroad Administration, which took control of the national rail network in early 1918, created a series of labor boards of adjustment, all staffed with representatives of labor and management.[8]\n\nDespite these kinds of initiatives, labor conflict persisted, in no small part due to the AFL Executive Council\u2019s repudiation of Gompers\u2019 no-strike pledge and disagreements over the second policy principle: the meaning of \u201cexisting standards.\u201d For one group of policymakers concentrated in the War Industries Board, that phrase meant just that: no change to prewar lines of power in employment relations. But for many workers and their allies in the Department of Labor, the statement applied only to working conditions, not to the question of unionization.[9] Moreover, the Wilson administration appeared to tacitly sanction unionization with its rhetoric of industrial democracy, which linked a war for democracy in Europe with the spread of democracy in American workplaces. Thus, as labor conflict surged over the summer of 1917 Gompers called for a special commission to investigate labor disturbances. The president\u2019s Mediation Commission investigated clashes in the Southwest\u2019s copper and Pacific Northwest timber industries, among telephone operators and urban street railway workers, and in meatpacking. The Commission adjudicated a number of these disputes but in practice enjoyed little power to enforce its recommendations. Labor conflict continued. Going into 1918, federal labor policy remained fragmented among various commissions, boards, and agencies in war-important sectors.[10]\n\nTo formulate and implement labor policies in war-related industries, President Wilson created the National War Labor board (NWLB) by executive order in April 1918. Composed of an equal number of representatives of business and labor, and co-chairs representing the public, the NWLB docketed and investigated cases in a wide range of firms. Warming to his vision of industrial democracy, co-chair Frank Walsh fought for the principle of living wages, the eight-hour day, and workers\u2019 right to organize and bargain collectively with their employers. With the surprising support of his presumptively pro-employer co-chair William H. Taft (1857-1930), Walsh succeeded in winning shorter hours, higher wages, equal pay for women doing equal work and, broadly, the principle of collective bargaining, in many industries. As a compromise between unions\u2019 demands for government protection of workers\u2019 right to organize and employers\u2019 insistence on open shops, the NWLB devised the shop committee, which gave employees voice but stopped short of union representation.[11]\n\nEven though the NWLB handled labor disputes in companies with government contracts, the Wilson administration\u2019s approach to labor policy fostered union growth broadly. Union membership grew by over 2 million between 1917 and 1920, a total gain of almost 70 percent.[12] Indirect government control of coal mining facilitated the growth of the United Mine Workers to over 500,000 members, making it the largest union in the United States. On the railroads, the United States Railroad Administration afforded unions a privileged position. Especially for workers in the offices, shops, and maintenance-of-way, whose unions had always been weaker than the operating crafts, government control enabled the growth of union membership. What was true on the railroads also held in industries with antiunion histories like steel, which had stood as an open-shop bastion since the 1892 Homestead Strike.[13] However, although unions, like those in steel, surged due to the enrollment of immigrant workers, this growth did not translate into more racially inclusive forms of organization. In fact, where black workers had gained footholds, white workers mobilized to push them out, as in the notorious Memphis railroad switchmen\u2019s \u201crace strike\u201d of 1919.\n\nWartime federal labor policy stopped well short of encouraging all forms of unionism and, in fact, worked to contain or eliminate the radical (and more gender and racially inclusive) alternative embodied in the Industrial Workers of the World. Whereas the AFL and its constituent unions broadly (although not always consistently) supported national war aims, the IWW repudiated the war and Wilson\u2019s policy. The same war economy favoring moderate unions also benefited the IWW, which enrolled increasing numbers of migratory farm workers, copper miners, and loggers. These in turn engaged more frequently in job actions and, by the summer of 1917, conducted major strikes in the southwest and northwest. These industrial actions, which threatened war-vital mining, timber, and food production, drew the venom of employers and state officials, who branded \u201cWobblies\u201d as disloyal or as German spies and saboteurs and demanded federal action against them. In this context, an IWW-led copper miners\u2019 strike in Arizona met with owners\u2019 violent resistance. Drawing the support of local sheriffs and vigilantes, these men orchestrated the rounding up of 1,200 strikers at bayonet-point and shipped them by railcar into the New Mexico desert\u2014the infamous Bisbee Deportation. Similar incidents followed that fall, as did the lynch-mob murder of IWW organizer Frank Little (1879-1917) in the mining-town of Butte, Montana. State-orchestrated repression followed these extra-legal incidents, culminating in a federal government campaign against the IWW, which involved Justice Department raids on IWW headquarters around the country and a federal grand jury indictment of 166 officials under the Espionage Act in September 1917, killing the organization as a viable union.[14]\n\nPostwar Strike Wave and Reaction, 1919 \u2191\n\nDespite the government\u2019s selective encouragement of unionism, state intervention\u2014especially in its emphasis on the idea of the shop committee and its promotion of industrial democracy\u2014nevertheless stimulated the spread of workers\u2019 movements challenging rigid craft organization.[15] However, following the November 1918 armistice these new directions and aspirations for meaningful postwar social reconstruction ran into reversed government policy and popular reaction against union gains. As the NWLB wound up its business and government controls came off the economy, employers determined to restore the open shop blocked the labor movement\u2019s march toward the extension of industrial democracy and the triumph of trade unionism.[16] The resulting clash produced one of the greatest strike years in American history.\n\nThe strike surge of 1919 featured unprecedented levels of industrial conflict. Acting as the capstone to the long strike wave of 1915-1922, it involved nearly one out of every four workers\u2014over 4,160,000 in total, 20 percent of the labor force\u2014walking out in more than 3,630 work stoppages, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.[17] As with wartime strikes, demands for living wages drove the majority of these industrial actions, but worker demands for expanded union democracy also animated the upsurge. Postwar labor conflict took on an insurgent quality as workers challenged managerial authority and union leadership and conventional trade union practice. The February Seattle General Strike embodied these qualities as locals of the Seattle Central Labor Council endorsed the walkout of shipyard workers in defiance of the AFL hierarchy, leading to a citywide shutdown. The actions of clothing workers, textile workers, telephone operators, and wildcat walkouts by railroad shop workers across spring and summer demonstrated comparable militancy. New groups of workers also struck for the first time, adding to the crisis atmosphere: actors in the New York and Chicago theater districts in August and the Boston police in September. The Great Steel Strike, when it unfolded in late September, capped the year\u2019s labor upheaval as 350,000 workers\u2014mostly immigrant and unskilled\u2014launched the biggest strike in United States history to date. So large was the steelworkers\u2019 action that when the United Mine Workers struck in early November it seemed like a denouement.[18]\n\nThe political context in which American workers undertook strike action differed markedly from that of the war years. Halting attempts to plan for peacetime reconversion and reconstruction foundered on employer-union disagreement. The Republicans\u2019 sweeping of Congress in the 1918 midterm elections and President Wilson\u2019s focus on the peace negotiations in Paris over the first half of 1919 made the circumstances more difficult. Public discontent with inflation moved the president to distance himself from the AFL and caution against significant wage rises. He also denounced strikes, especially by public servants like the police. Compounding matters, widespread fears about Bolshevik influences in the strike wave, made believable by a series of anarchist bombings in June, drove a virulent postwar red scare. Government and popular antiradicalism targeted mainly immigrant anarchists and leftists but many Americans could only comprehend the Seattle General Strike or the Great Steel Strike as Bolshevik-driven. Given the mood, the efforts of progressive-minded unions, like those on the railroads and in the mines, which advocated for the permanent national control of their industries, stood little chance of success. The National Industrial Conference Wilson convened in October 1919 to resolve the labor upheaval deadlocked. On one side were AFL unionists seeking to rescue the failing steel strike and, more expansively, gain an equal voice with management in the governance of industry. On the other side were employers resolved to remove unions from their workplaces. The conference illustrated the gulf between labor and capital and the distance traveled since the summer of 1916.[19]\n\nOn the face of it, organized labor\u2019s political fortunes stood entirely reversed in the war\u2019s immediate aftermath. Union membership dropped some 1.5 million members and although the well-established unions more or less maintained their positions, any gains made among the unorganized, particularly in the mass-production industries, vanished. The postwar strike wave illustrated the limits of the \u201cnew unionism\u201d evident during the war years with its emphasis on broader scope and extent of union action, inter-union organizing campaigns, and efforts to extend unionism\u2019s influence to previously excluded groups, all animated by ideals of industrial democracy. More dramatic yet was a bill introduced into the Senate in early 1920 outlawing railroad strikes and criminalizing any interference with interstate trade. The bitter truth, observes historian David Brody, was that American workers could not hope to win union recognition, let alone more democratic workplaces, without state intervention.[20]\n\nStill, even if the open shop ruled in the 1920s, wartime mobilization established precedents that would shape industrial relations for much of the 20th century. Historians like Joseph McCartin see industrial democracy as providing Americans with a new vocabulary to debate labor-capital relations that, together with new patterns of labor management, planted seeds that would germinate into industrial unionism a decade later. The AFL and trade unionists generally emerged from the war more strongly oriented toward Washington, D.C. The Labor-Democratic alliance cooled during the 1920s only to be more firmly cemented by Franklin D. Roosevelt (1882-1945) during the New Deal. Lastly, David Brody draws a direct connection between an often-overlooked feature of the 1919 Industrial Conference: a compromise agreement that employees must be allowed to collectively bargain through representatives of their own choosing. In the short run, the clause \u201crepresentatives of their own choosing\u201d opened the door to company unionism in the 1920s. In the longer run, Supreme Court decisions opened a constitutional pathway for the 1935 Wagner Act\u2019s protections of workers\u2019 rights to union membership, union recognition, and collective bargaining.[21]\n\n\n\nPaul Michel Taillon, University of Auckland\n\nSection Editor: Edward G. Lengel"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/news-wires-white-papers-and-books/labor-movement", "page_content": "7: The Labor Movement\n\nThroughout the history of industry in America, workers and employers have often found themselves in conflict over issues such as wages, workplace safety, the length of the workday, and job security. Dating back to the late 1700s, workers began forming unions, banding together to negotiate with employers. From those small early unions to the large national organizations of the twenty-first century, the basic principle of the labor movement has been the same: one employee is powerless to achieve change in the workplace, but when workers join together they become a significant transformative force.\n\nFor that reason, employers have generally been wary of unions, fearing that a well-organized workforce would make costly demands that would cut into profits. Many of the battles between workers and employers have hinged less on specific demands for wages or benefits than on the basic right of workers to belong to a union and to have that union represent them in negotiations with management.\n\nAlthough numerous disputes have been resolved through discussion, many of the major gains for the labor movement have come about as a result of strikes, when employees refuse to work until an agreement has been reached. Some strikes last just a few hours, while others stretch on for years. Some have been resolved peacefully while others have erupted into bloody, violent conflicts. Some strikes have concluded in victory for the workers while others have ended in utter defeat.\n\nAs a whole, strikes have been an effective tool for the labor movement to achieve lasting gains for all workers. Strikes have not been the only tool used by unions, however. The most effective labor organizations have appealed to the sympathies of the general public, spreading the word about employer abuses through mass demonstrations, parades, and literature. Such demonstrations, for example, led to laws against the use of child labor.\n\nWORDS TO KNOW\n\nblacklist: A list of employees involved in union activity that was sent to employers to warn them against hiring those people; to effectively prevent those workers fired for unionism from getting another job. boycott: A refusal to do business with a certain company as a form of protest; often takes the form of employees refusing to work or encouraging consumers to stop buying the company's products. capitalism: An economic system in which the companies that produce goods or provide services are owned privately by individuals or groups of people. Owners have invested funds, or capital, in a business and earn profits when the business succeeds. collective bargaining: The process of negotiating a contract between an employer and the union that represents the employees. general strike: A work stoppage by all organized workers in various industries in a city, region, or entire country; usually a form of protest designed to halt or greatly disrupt the normal functioning of the area (city, region, or country) in question. injunction: A court order that either prohibits an action (such as a strike) or forces action to be taken (such as striking workers returning to work). minimum wage: The lowest rate of pay that an employer is allowed to pay employees, as decided either by law or by a negotiated contract. picket line: A group of striking workers marching at the entrance of their workplace to inform fellow employees and the general public of a labor dispute and to influence others not to enter the workplace. socialism: An economic system in which the means of producing goods and providing services are owned by the community rather than by private individuals or corporations; all members of the community share in the work and wealth is distributed equally. strike: A refusal by employees to work in an attempt to gain concessions from their employer, including increased wages, safer working conditions, better job security, and the recognition of the employees' union. strikebreakers: Workers hired to replace striking employees; strikebreakers allow business to be continued without interruption, thereby defeating the purpose of the strike. Also referred to as replacement workers or, in a derogatory sense, as scabs. union: An organization of workers designed to negotiate with employers for workers' rights and to secure improvements in such areas as wages, working hours, benefits, and workplace safety.\n\nAt many points in history, the support of citizens has been crucial to labor efforts. Unions have also urged lawmakers to respond to widespread problems affecting worker health and safety. Although the courts and legislators were historically on the side of business owners, many laws were enacted during the twentieth century to aid employees. Throughout its long and bloody history, the labor movement, as with any social reform movement, has balanced significant victories with numerous setbacks. And though union membership was historically low at the start of the twenty-first century, millions of workers have the labor movement to thank for many positive aspects of their jobs.\n\nThe industrialization of America\n\nDuring much of the 1700s, the nation's economy was dominated by agriculture, and most workers were farmers living in rural areas. Some Americans lived in cities or towns, working as tradespeople\u2014carpenters, printers, tailors, shoemakers, metalworkers (known as smiths)\u2014and in other jobs. A tradesperson spent many years perfecting his craft, starting out as an apprentice, then working as a paid employee, known as a journeyman, and finally becoming a master of the craft, perhaps owning his own shop. Tradespeople studied every element of their craft, creating an entire product from start to finish. Their products included shoes, cabinets, clothing, and so on. Such items were generally customized to the needs of the individual buyer. With the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s, the United States experienced a dramatic cultural and economic shift, and the lives of workers were never the same.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the mid-1700s and spread to the United States by the late 1700s. The earliest innovations of the Industrial Revolution came in the field of textiles, the manufacture of cloth. Prior to industrialization, wool or cotton cloth was made by spinning fibers into thread or yarn using a spinning wheel. The threads were then woven into cloth on a hand loom. These tasks were performed mainly in the workers' homes.\n\nA number of eighteenth-century inventions dramatically altered the production of cloth. British inventor John Kay (1704\u20131764; some sources say c. 1780) created the flying shuttle in 1733. It was a device that accelerated the process of weaving. As a result, the demand for thread increased, and subsequent inventions in the 1760s vastly sped up thread production. Textile production moved from workers' homes to factories, in part because the new machines were too large to fit in homes.\n\nIn 1790 the first completely mechanized textile mill operated by water-powered machines was established by British industrialist Samuel Slater (1768\u20131835) in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Initially mills and factories had to be located near a major body of water because they relied on water power to operate the machinery. With improvements made to the steam engine during the late 1700s and early 1800s, however, factories were driven by steam power and could be built anywhere.\n\nA number of other innovations allowed for rapid industrial expansion in the United States. The 1793 invention of the cotton gin, credited to Eli Whitney (1765\u20131825), allowed for rapid processing of cotton fibers. It was a job that was extremely time-consuming when performed by hand. The cotton gin transformed cotton into a highly profitable crop that soon dominated the landscape of the American South, making the United States the leading supplier of the world's raw cotton. The rise of cotton as the South's main crop also led to a greater demand for slave labor. Many southern farmers believed the growing and harvesting of cotton would not be profitable enough if fieldhands had to be paid.\n\nIn 1798, a few years after the cotton gin was patented, Whitney implemented another innovation that contributed significantly to the nation's changing economy. He developed a way of making weapons using standardized, interchangeable parts, giving rise to the assembly-line method of production. With this method, employees worked on one specific part, performing the same function repeatedly for the entire workday. For company owners, the assembly line meant that items could be mass-produced, made quickly and in large quantities. For the workers, assembly lines made for a tedious and boring workday.\n\nIn 1814 businessman Francis Cabot Lowell (1775\u20131817) opened a textile factory in Waltham, Massachusetts, that became a model for the American factory system. Lowell's factory incorporated the entire process of textile production, including every step in the conversion of raw cotton to finished cloth. Lowell hired a number of young unmarried women, many of whom had formerly lived and worked on farms in nearby rural areas, to work in his factory. They earned far less than the male employees. To compensate, however, Lowell offered boardinghouses in which his female workers lived, providing meals, religious instruction, and educational opportunities. The women were bound by a strict set of rules, including curfews and mandatory church attendance. Over the next few decades, Lowell's type of factory and his approach to hiring female workers were imitated by industrialists throughout the northeastern United States.\n\nAt first, many of the women hired to work in mills and factories were delighted to have jobs. Many were earning money of their own for the first time in their lives, and they were pleased to send money home to their families, to buy something for themselves occasionally, or to save money for their education. Those who came from farms experienced the excitement of city living and the thrill of being away from their parents. But for many of the \"mill girls,\" as they were commonly called, the pleasure of earning money was soon overshadowed by the exhaustion of working twelve hours or more a day, six days a week. Many of the young women objected to the many rules they had to follow as well. For example, they resented being told what time to go to bed or that they had to attend church services.\n\nEarly union actions\n\nThe earliest types of labor unions were known as mutual aid societies, or benevolent societies. Groups of workers in a particular trade pooled their resources to help fellow workers who were injured or ill. They also aided the widows of workers who had died. Mutual aid societies often sought a standard wage from the owner, refusing to accept less than that wage and protesting the hiring of any worker for less than the standard pay.\n\nEven before the factory system came to dominate the industrial landscape, significant changes had taken place in American manufacturing. As the population grew in the American colonies, competition among craftsmen became stiffer. To keep costs of production down and therefore offer goods at lower prices than those of competitors, craftsmen had to hire larger numbers of journeymen and apprentices than ever before. These employees had to work longer hours for less pay than in the past. In response, they organized into unions to register their complaints.\n\nAmong the first of these journeymen to form unions were shoemakers in Philadelphia, and printers and cabinetmakers in New York City. These craftsmen banded together during the 1790s to protect their wages and establish standard working hours. Union members also sought to prevent shop owners from hiring nonunion members. These early unions usually had to meet secretly. If their activities were discovered, the unionists were taken to court and convicted of conspiracy. The justice system in the newly formed United States was based on British law. In England, the rights of property were considered more important than the rights of people. The laws basically held that the nation's growth depended on the ability of business to operate without obstacles. When workers unionized for better wages, that was considered a significant obstacle.\n\nBy the 1820s and 1830s, urban laborers could see that the factory system would be permanent, and that this system held disadvantages for the worker. The gulf between the interests of the owners and of the workers was widening. Profits soared because of the workers' long hours, low pay, and increasing productivity. Many workers felt that they were little more than slaves. During this period, labor organizations became more focused on negotiating with employers for better wages and conditions rather than simply acting as mutual aid societies.\n\nBeginning in the late 1820s with the Workingmen's Party, workers established political parties to support the interests of laborers. These parties nominated candidates for political office who would try to implement laws to benefit working people. The Workingmen's Party advocated such policies as a standard ten-hour workday and free education for all children. The party opposed child labor and the practice of imprisoning people for falling into debt. The rise of labor-oriented parties came as a direct result of changes in voting laws in the United States. Prior to 1820, only white men who owned property could vote. By 1820, all white men could vote, though many were prevented from doing so by such obstacles as the poll tax (a fee required in order to vote) or literacy tests (an exam to determine if the would-be voter could read and write). These restrictions were designed to keep poor and uneducated men from having a voice in the political process. All such taxes and tests were outlawed for white male voters by 1840, a change that gave the ordinary working man a greater voice in government issues.\n\nThe earliest unions were organized by trade, with shoemakers in one union, for example, and cabinetmakers in another. In 1827 a number of craft unions in Philadelphia formed the first American labor organization that included workers from a variety of trades: the Mechanics' Union of Trade Associations. Similar associations followed throughout the 1830s in cities such as New York, Boston, and Pittsburgh. In 1834 these city-wide associations came under the leadership of a nationwide organization, the National Trades Union (NTU). The citywide unions launched pro-labor newspapers, assisted striking workers, and offered support for political candidates who championed the rights of the worker. Their primary goal was to reduce the workday from the current standard of twelve hours to ten. The NTU lobbied the federal government while the workers conducted strikes.\n\nIn 1835 the Philadelphia Trades Union launched a general strike, the first in U.S. history. A general strike involves a work stoppage by a large number of workers, usually from several different fields, in an attempt to greatly disrupt the normal functioning of a city or region. The Philadelphia general strike of 1835 organized workers from seventeen different fields to stop working. After three weeks, the workers won the battle. Philadelphia's City Council agreed to institute a ten-hour day for city workers, and private employers soon announced that they would also implement the shorter workday. Similar strikes followed in other cities, with the workers winning more often than not. In 1840 President Martin Van Buren (1782\u20131862; served 1837\u201341) issued an order limiting the workday to ten hours for all federal government employees.\n\nUnion ups and downs in the mid-1800s\n\nNumerous unions were formed throughout the 1830s, and membership in those unions rose steadily, primarily among skilled laborers. Unskilled laborers, being more easily replaced, wielded very little power and did not generally unionize at that time. Skilled workers continually sought improvements in their working conditions, resorting to strikes when all other methods of negotiation failed. Some of the strikes staged at this time met with success, though many failed, in part because the law was on the side of employers. A number of state courts convicted unionists of conspiracy, declaring that strikes and even the unions themselves were illegal.\n\nUnions were dealt an additional blow with the onset of a severe economic depression beginning in 1837. Throughout the history of the United States, economic downturns have led to difficulties for organized labor. During the depression of the 1830s, employers struggled to stay in business, laying off large numbers of workers to reduce their costs. The workers who were employed worried more about holding onto a job than about improving the conditions of that job. Engaging in union activity meant risking their jobs. With large numbers of workers unemployed and desperate to earn a living in any way possible, it would have been easy for a factory owner to fire striking workers and find plentiful replacements among the ranks of the unemployed. During the years of the depression, unions were considerably weakened or dissolved entirely. This situation repeated itself many times throughout the history of the labor movement.\n\nBy the early 1840s, the economic conditions in the United States had begun to improve and many businesses were booming. The population grew at a rapid rate, in part because of a steady flow of immigrants coming primarily from Germany and Ireland. The railways grew dramatically, with hundreds of miles of track laid down each year. The improvements in the economy meant that workers were in a better position to negotiate with employers. Employees felt more secure in their jobs, and employers wanted to keep the workforce productive to ensure continued success.\n\nAs cross-country transportation became a possibility in the United States in the mid-1800s, labor leaders began organizing unions that went beyond local borders. Although unions reached out to workers across state and regional lines, other lines were rarely, if ever, crossed. For example, nearly all unions barred black members and many limited the participation of women. Also, a strong anti-immigrant prejudice kept Irish, German, Chinese, and other laborers out of unions. Resentment toward women and other minority workers was fueled in part by fears that they would take jobs away from white men because employers could, and did, pay them less. But many workers also were motivated simply by sexism, racism, and a fear of foreigners.\n\nOn some occasions male and female workers did band together. For example, in 1860 thousands of shoemakers, men and women, went on strike in Lynn, Massachusetts. Marching through the streets despite snowstorms, the workers attracted the attention of the press and the support of shoemakers throughout New England. In all, some 20,000 workers went on strike in the region in what came to be known as the Great Shoemakers Strike. The workers were attempting to secure an increase in their wages, as well as demanding that the employers recognize their unions as legitimate organizations. The employers hired replacement workers, but the striking shoemakers continued their campaign, striking for two months. Finally the employers agreed to a wage increase, but they refused to recognize the union. Many thousands of striking shoemakers returned to work, celebrating their increase in pay.\n\nThe American Civil War\n\nThe American Civil War (1861\u201365) began after several southern states seceded, or withdrew, from the United States in order to establish an independent nation in the spring of 1861. The secession was motivated in large part by the conviction in the South that the rights of individual states should have more weight than the rights of the nation. The issue of states' rights was closely connected with the issue of slavery. The southern economy relied heavily on slave labor, and southern lawmakers felt that the legality of slavery should be decided by each state. Slavery had been abolished in the North and in some western and midwestern states as well. Many people in those regions believed passionately that slavery should be outlawed nationwide. Tension between the North and South had been building for decades and reached a boiling point in 1861 when the war began.\n\nThe Civil War devastated the nation. The fighting left a path of destruction throughout much of the South, which lost the war. In the end, more than 600,000 people had died from battles and disease. For many northern businesses, however, the war did not result in destruction but rather in rapid growth, fueling their transition from modest-sized companies to giant corporations. As with any conflict, the Civil War created a massive demand for a number of products, sparking tremendous growth among many businesses. Other factors contributed to the growth of businesses at this time, including technological innovations that made workers more productive and the further expansion of the railways, which enabled manufacturers to ship their products to distant locations.\n\nThe postwar years marked the rise of big business and a dramatic increase in the number of millionaire business owners in the United States. Those businessmen who made a fortune during the war devoted themselves to increasing that fortune afterward. Determined to minimize competition, the \"captains of industry,\" as they came to be known, opted to buy up competing firms, forming monopolies in their particular fields. A monopoly meant that the business owner could determine pricing and wages without having to worry about competition from other companies.\n\nAnother significant development to arise from the Civil War was the abolition of slavery. With the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, slavery became illegal throughout the United States. Freedom from slavery held great promise for African Americans, but in reality freedom proved elusive. The newly freed slaves who stayed in the South continued to work in slave-like conditions due to the Black Codes created in many southern states. These laws and policies severely restricted the lives of blacks, limiting the jobs they could obtain, the areas in which they could live, and the public places they could frequent. Those African Americans who moved North faced racism and resentment, with many white workers fearing that black laborers would drive them out of their jobs. Black workers were attractive to some employers because they would accept lower wages than whites.\n\nLabor after the Civil War\n\nWith the growth of businesses and the booming postwar economy came an increase in union membership and labor disputes. As companies grew in size, workers felt increasingly distanced from the ownership, making it more necessary to unite with other workers to form a powerful group to negotiate for workers' rights. The National Labor Union (NLU), founded in 1866, became the first large-scale national union in the United States. The NLU attempted to unite workers from a variety of trades in a federation, or network, of several local and national unions. Its goals included establishing an eight-hour workday nationwide, reforming banking and tax laws to benefit working people, and founding a National Labor Party to represent the rights of workers. William Sylvis (1828\u20131869), who had earlier founded the iron workers' National Molders' Union, played a key role in founding the NLU. He served as the union president from 1868 until his death one year later.\n\nThe NLU's stated policy was to include women and nonwhite workers. In practice the NLU did permit some women unionists to join but generally excluded black workers and Chinese immigrant laborers. Black unionists formed a separate organization, the Colored National Labor Union (CNLU), in 1869. Chinese immigrants were the objects of widespread discrimination in the labor movement and in the larger society, due primarily to racism and a general prejudice against foreigners, especially people of color. The Chinese immigrants, unable to secure decent jobs, took low-paying work that white workers didn't want. Many white laborers then feared that Chinese workers would take good jobs from them by agreeing to lower wages.\n\nAnother major national labor organization of that period was the Noble and Holy Order of the Knights of Labor, formed in Philadelphia in 1869 by garment worker Uriah Stephens (1821\u20131882). The Knights of Labor began as a secret society but changed that policy in 1881. Open to workers in a number of professions, the Knights of Labor embraced women and African Americans, a membership policy unusual for unions of that period. The Knights did, however, oppose membership for Chinese workers and supported the Chinese Exclusion Act, a law banning Chinese immigration to the United States. The primary goals of the Knights of Labor included establishing an eight-hour workday, putting a stop to child labor and prison labor, and guaranteeing that women would earn the same wages as men. The Knights also advocated the concept of worker-owned businesses.\n\nThe union attracted such prominent social reformers as women's rights activists Elizabeth Cady Stanton (1815\u20131902) and Susan B. Anthony (1820\u20131906) and temperance activist Frances Willard (1839\u20131898). The Knights of Labor approached strikes as a method of last resort, preferring instead to negotiate with employers. The union devoted great effort to public education about the plight of the American worker and to lobbying for laws that would support workers' rights.\n\nChild Labor\n\nThe technological innovations that sparked the Industrial Revolution in the United States in the late 1700s led to many advancements in American society. But with the establishment of an industrial economy came a number of social ills, including a dramatic rise in child labor. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, many children worked with their parents on farms or in home workshops. As jobs in factories, mills, and mines became more plentiful, great numbers of children began working in industrial settings. Child workers appealed to employers for several reasons. Children were particularly suited to some jobs because of their smaller size. Tiny hands were effective at keeping machinery parts working properly, for example, and small bodies could fit into tight spots in underground mines. In addition, children complained less than adults and could be manipulated more easily. Furthermore, children accepted lower wages than adults.\n\nFor many industrial workers throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, a job in a factory or a mine did not translate into an ability to pay the bills and feed the family. Many in the working class were extremely poor. In a number of families, the only way they could earn enough to survive was if both parents and every able-bodied child worked. Some children worked only during the summer months and others during school vacations, but many worked year-round, six days a week, twelve hours a day. They endured dangerous and unsanitary working conditions. They handled machinery that could maim or kill them. Children workers entered mines where the air was filled with coal dust and explosions and collapses were commonplace. Some worked in fields breathing in deadly pesticides. They spent little or no time in school, and many never learned to read or write.\n\nAlthough some people made no objection to child labor, others focused on it as one of society's greatest problems. By the early 1900s, when the American workforce included more than two million children under the age of sixteen, a significant movement to ban the hiring of children had begun. The National Child Labor Committee, established in 1904, and numerous state committees worked to persuade the public and lawmakers that child labor placed young people in harm's way and deprived them of both their youth and their future. Some state laws restricting child labor were passed, but enforcement of such laws was minimal. In addition, many employers ignored the restrictions outright. Attempts to pass a federal law and a constitutional amendment failed. It wasn't until the 1930s, amid the many social reforms instituted as part of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, that national laws were enacted to restrict child labor.\n\nWith the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, hiring children under the age of sixteen for mining and manufacturing jobs became illegal. Over the next decade, many new jobs were created that required greater levels of skill and education. Better education for children became a national priority. In 1949 Congress expanded upon the existing law, banning child labor in such additional fields as commercial farming, transportation, and public utilities.\n\nChild labor, though illegal, still exists in the United States, with many children working as migrant farm laborers and in factories. The number of child workers is highest in poor immigrant communities, especially among those living in the United States illegally. Parents who fear being deported and who desperately need the money are unlikely to report to the authorities that their children are being exploited by employers. Such employers are not only breaking the law, they are also violating a basic principle of modern American society: that children have a right to be children.\n\nDespite the growth of labor unions, many American workers were stuck in a cycle of poverty, working for low wages and often under dangerous conditions. As more and more working people struggled to survive, the wealth of the big business owners continued to balloon and was on full display. The very rich built castle-like homes, vacationed on massive yachts and in summer resort towns, and threw fancy parties that were models of excess. In their book From the Folks Who Brought You the Weekend: A Short, Illustrated History of Labor in the United States, Priscilla Murolo and A. B. Chitty highlighted the gap between the rich and the poor: \"Children of the rich grew up with ponies, private tutors, and grand tours of Europe. In immigrant ghettos like New York City's Lower East Side, children lived in tenement flats with little daylight, less ventilation, and no running water.\" This era of U.S. history, during the 1870s and into the 1880s, is known as the Gilded Age. The term \"gilded\" refers to a decorative outer layer of gold, a lavish and luxurious surface that provides a deceptive cover for the darker reality beneath.\n\nEmployers strike back, violently\n\nPossessing all of the wealth and most of the power, business owners did everything they could to prevent workers from effectively organizing. Economic downturns, like the depression beginning in 1873, did little to dent the fortunes of the captains of industry but devastated the ability of the workers to negotiate with employers. In addition, the wealthy gave generous gifts to government officials, a policy that helped sway the law in their favor. With law enforcers and politicians under the influence of business owners, numerous strikes and worker demonstrations were brought to a violent end by the police during the late 1800s. During the winter of 1873 to 1874, numerous workers, unemployed because of the depression, organized to demand some form of government assistance. At a rally in New York City's Tompkins Square Park on January 13, 1874, thousands gathered for a peaceful demonstration. They were taken by surprise when the police arrived and began attacking the demonstrators. Hundreds were injured and several were arrested and sent to prison.\n\nThe following winter, coal miners in Pennsylvania's Schuylkill County began what came to be known as the Long Strike. Coal miners endured particularly dangerous and miserable working conditions. In addition, many in the industry had lost their jobs to newly arrived and lower-paid European immigrants. Franklin Gowen (1836\u20131889) was president of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad. Under his leadership, the company had bought numerous coal mines in the area, and he aimed to destroy the coal miners' union. Part of his plan involved hiring spies from the famed Pinkerton Detective Agency to pose as union members. Pinkerton detectives were often hired by business owners to break up strikes or weaken union strength. When Gowen and other coal-mine operators in Pennsylvania cut the miners' wages by as much as 20 percent, the workers went on strike, as the owners knew they would.\n\nViolent clashes between the striking miners and armed strikebreakers, the people hired by the company to replace the striking workers, followed. After several months, the strikers could not hold out any longer. Out of desperation many opted to return to work, forced to withdraw from the union and to accept the pay cut. The union was essentially destroyed. Then Gowen launched a legal attack on those thought to have led the strike. Relying on the testimony of the undercover Pinkerton men, Gowen claimed that a secret society of Irish American miners, known as the Molly Maguires, was responsible for a series of murders related to the coal-mine strikes in Schuylkill County. A number of miners were tried for the crimes as a result. Due to what many historians describe as the suspicious tactics of the prosecutor, none other than Franklin Gowen himself, as many as nineteen miners were executed by hanging.\n\nGowen's aggressive actions against the coal miners encouraged owners in other industries to use harsh measures to prevent or repress strikes. Many workers, however, were equally determined not to be bullied by the powerful business owners. A strike by a few dozen railway workers in Baltimore, Maryland, during July 1877 started small, but momentum built throughout the region. When a small group of railroad employees walked off the job in Martinsburg, West Virginia, railroad officials asked the governor to order the state militia to shoot at the strikers. But the militia members were local citizens who sympathized with the workers. They refused to fire on the strikers, and the strike spread.\n\nOver the next several days, railroad workers in numerous communities all across the country went on strike. In several cases, militia members followed the example in Martinsburg and refused to use their weapons to disperse striking crowds. When called upon, federal troops did resort to violence, and bitter fighting broke out in many cities. Huge rallies, attended by workers from many different industries, were held in New York City, Boston, Chicago, and many other cities. Workers in St. Louis staged a five-day general strike.\n\nDespite the widespread support of workers, however, the Great Railroad Strike was soon thwarted. U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes (1822\u20131893; served 1877\u201381) declared the strikers to be in rebellion against the government. In spite of heavy resistance from the workers and their supporters, the might of the troops outweighed that of the citizens. Dozens of strikers died, and many more were injured. Owners reversed the wage cuts that had begun the strike in the first place, but the strike leaders were fired and blacklisted (placed on a list of employees involved in union activity that was used to warn other employers against hiring those people).\n\nMore than 100,000 railroad workers had participated in the strike, making the Great Railroad Strike the largest up to that point in U.S. history. The strike was notable not just for its size, but also because federal military might was used against American citizens during peacetime. In addition, large numbers of women and African Americans participated in the strike alongside white male workers. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the Great Railroad Strike was that, in spite of the fact that the strike was violently crushed, the American labor movement emerged with a new sense of power and unity.\n\nThe AFL begins as the century ends\n\nAs the 1800s came to a close, the struggle between workers and owners reached epic proportions. Workers in a number of fields continued to stage strikes in the face of intimidating odds. Businesses were large, wealthy, and very powerful. The federal government sided with business, readily calling out federal troops if strikers gathered in large numbers and refused to give up their fight. Strike leaders usually lost their jobs and, in some cases, faced criminal charges and severe punishment, including execution.\n\nTo do battle with these powerful forces, a new national labor organization formed in 1881: the Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions of the United States and Canada. Unlike the Knights of Labor, then the most powerful union in the nation, and one that embraced all types of workers, the federation was composed of trade unions representing mostly skilled workers. Although the Knights promoted lofty ideals, the Federation focused on purely practical issues, namely workers' economic needs. In his Pictorial History of American Labor, William Cahn summarized the differences between the two organizations as represented by their slogans: \"An injury to one is the concern of all\" for the Knights of Labor, and \"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work\" for the Federation. In 1886 the Federation reorganized as the American Federation of Labor (AFL), an organization that has exerted considerable influence in the world of industry since that time.\n\nMuch of the AFL's philosophy came from its first president, Samuel Gompers (1850\u20131924), who became one of the most important leaders in the history of the labor movement. Rising as a young man to the helm of the Cigar Makers' International Union, Gompers proved himself a natural leader with a passion for the concerns of the working man. Many other union leaders set idealistic goals: they wanted society to be restructured to balance power between owners and workers. But Gompers had a simpler plan. He felt that unions should avoid theories about society and political systems; instead, they should concentrate simply on basic issues like workers' wages, the length of the workday, and job conditions. One of the first issues championed by the AFL was the eight-hour workday, a notion that was extremely popular among workers but had been abandoned by the Knights of Labor as impractical.\n\nHaymarket Square\n\nThe eight-hour-day movement rapidly gained a large following all across the United States. In support of the shorter workday, workers planned strikes and demonstrations to begin on May 1, 1886. The protests were to occur in numerous cities, including Milwaukee, St. Louis, New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Chicago. The vast majority of workers wanted the strikes to remain peaceful, rejecting the notion of violence. Some radicals, however, announced their desire for social revolution, an overthrow of capitalism through any means necessary. In a capitalistic system, like that found in the United States, most companies that produce goods or provide services are owned privately by individuals or groups of people who profit when the companies succeed. Many of the radicals described themselves as anarchists, people seeking the dissolution of a central government and of an economic system based on private ownership.\n\nNewspapers widely reported on the speeches and writings of such radicals, heightening concern among business owners and police that the May 1 strikes would turn deadly. On that day, more than 350,000 workers in a number of industries went on strike across the nation, participating in parades and marches. These demonstrations were, for the most part, conducted peacefully. In many industries, the protests were successful, resulting in a change to an eight-hour workday.\n\nTens of thousands of the workers participating in the May 1 strikes were located in Chicago. The strikes and demonstrations began peacefully on that day, but tension remained high in the city. Many residents and police officers expected conflict to erupt. Two days later, workers at the McCormick Harvesting Works were locked out of their jobs, and strikebreakers were brought in with police escorts. Violence erupted, with the police shooting into the crowds of striking workers. Several strikers were killed. Outraged, the city's more militant (or aggressive), anarchist labor leaders called for a mass protest the following night, May 4, at Chicago's Haymarket Square. Toward the end of that protest, with only a few hundred in the crowd, the police arrived to shut down the meeting. Just as the speaker, Samuel Fielden (1847\u20131922), announced that the meeting was a peaceful one, someone threw a bomb at the police officers. The police responded by shooting into the crowd. Several police officers and workers died, and dozens more were injured.\n\nAs a result, panic gripped the city. Police raided homes and union meeting halls, arresting hundreds of union activists. Eventually eight anarchists, including Fielden, were charged with the bombing, though six of the men were not even present at the Haymarket Square protest. The eight men were convicted. Despite widespread pleas for mercy coming from workers around the world, four of the men were executed by hanging in November 1887. The bombing at Haymarket Square and the subsequent trial weakened the union effort because, in the minds of many, union members became associated with violent, radical revolutionaries.\n\nThe Homestead strike\n\nAfter the Haymarket Square affair, relations between workers and business owners became tenser than they had been, with each side feeling at war with the other. Laborers became increasingly determined to reject unfair working conditions, and owners became equally determined to prevent workers from having the power to damage their business. One of the more explosive confrontations of that period took place at the Carnegie Steel Company's plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania. During the summer of 1892, the plant manager announced that, in spite of a contract with union members guaranteeing a certain wage, pay would be cut significantly. Members of the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers union refused to accept the pay cut. Thus, manager Henry Clay Frick shut down the plant, intending to reopen it with strikebreakers.\n\nThe workers, supported by sympathetic townspeople, took over the town in the hopes of preventing Carnegie from sending in the replacement workers. The company sent 300 men from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to defend the company's property and escort replacement workers into the plant. The Pinkerton detectives arrived on barges, landing at the banks of the Monongahela River. In a heated confrontation, shots were exchanged between the Pinkerton men and the striking workers. After hours of gunfire that left seven workers and three armed guards dead, the Pinkerton employees surrendered, giving up their weapons for a guarantee that they could leave town safely.\n\nThe Carnegie workers won the battle against the Pinkertons, but they ultimately lost the war with the Carnegie Steel Company. The governor of Pennsylvania ordered militia forces to go to Homestead to provide armed protection for one thousand replacement workers. Then the company took the strike leaders to court, charging them with murder, aggravated riot, and conspiracy. The strikers were not convicted of any charges, but the union, then the largest in the United States, was considerably weakened by the extensive legal costs of the trials. After five months on strike, many of the workers abandoned their union membership so they could return to work, forced to accept the wage cuts they had gone on strike to protest initially.\n\nThe Pullman strike\n\nTwo years later, another deadly confrontation between workers and law enforcers took place, this time during a strike affecting the railroad industry in Chicago. In the midst of a terrible economic depression that had begun in 1893, workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company\u2014manufacturer of sleeping cars for trains\u2014had endured several wage cuts. The company's owner, George Pullman, also owned the homes that many of the workers rented and the stores where they bought their food. Even after cutting their pay for the fifth time, Pullman refused to give his workers a break on rent or discounts on food, so the Pullman workers went on strike in May 1894. They asked for and received the support of the large American Railway Union (ARU), which was led by Eugene Debs (1855\u20131926), one of labor's most influential leaders. Together, the thousands of striking workers shut down numerous railway lines.\n\nA U.S. district court judge in Chicago ordered the workers to stop interfering with the operations of the railroads. In turn, U.S. President Grover Cleveland (1837\u20131908; served 1885\u201389, 1893\u201397) sent federal troops to Chicago to enforce the judge's order. When the troops arrived in Chicago on July 4, riots broke out. As the troops struggled to take control over the next few days, some thirty workers were killed, dozens more were wounded, and several hundred were arrested, including Debs and other labor leaders. The Pullman strike was effectively crushed, as was the ARU.\n\nThe events surrounding the Pullman strike convinced Debs that the industrial world needed to find an alternative to the system of capitalism in order to eliminate conflict between workers and owners. In a profit-driven system like capitalism, Debs believed, the success of the owners depended on exploiting, or taking advantage of, the workers. After the Pullman strike, Debs turned to the political theories of socialism and became a key player in the 1898 founding of the Social Democratic Party, which became the Socialist Party of America in 1901. In a socialist system, the means of producing goods and providing services are owned by the community rather than by private individuals or corporations. Under socialism, all members of the community share in the work and in the profits. Debs became one of the best-known socialists in the nation, running as the Socialist Party candidate for president in 1900, 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920.\n\n\"One big union\"\n\nSome of the bitterest conflicts between laborers and owners occurred in the mining industry. Miners typically worked ten-hour days at the turn of the twentieth century, earning low wages for extremely difficult work. Many suffered from diseases associated with working in underground mines, and miners were always at risk of dying in a mining accident or an underground explosion. Under the militant leadership of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), miners in the western states conducted several strikes during the 1890s and early 1900s. Each time the mining companies retaliated by sending in strikebreakers and armed militia while seeking court orders to forcibly end the strike. One of the leaders of the WFM was William \"Big Bill\" Haywood (1869\u20131928), an energetic and radical labor activist who devoted much of his life to the union cause. Another longtime labor activist during that time was Mary \"Mother\" Jones (c. 1830\u20131930), who devoted much energy to the plight of miners.\n\nDuring the winter of 1905, Haywood, Debs, Mother Jones, and other radical labor leaders gathered for a historic meeting in Chicago that yielded a new and powerful national labor organization: the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Represented by the slogan \"one big union,\" the IWW was open to all members of the working class, in all industries. Created in part as an alternative to the American Federation of Labor, and reminiscent of the philosophies of the Knights of Labor, the IWW aimed to completely restructure society rather than simply address issues like wages, working hours, and job conditions. The IWW advocated socialist views, suggesting that there would be an ongoing struggle between the working class and the \"employing class\" until the workers took control of production. IWW members came to be known as Wobblies. The name may have come from the phrase \"wobbling the works,\" a code for committing sabotage, or destructive acts designed to halt production.\n\nBecause of its politically radical ideas and its leaders' passionate language, the IWW was accused of encouraging violence and sabotage among workers. In reality, however, most of the strike activity led by the organization was peaceful. The IWW achieved many gains, leading major strikes among textile workers in Massachusetts and New Jersey. In addition, the IWW organized thousands of workers that had previously been neglected by other large labor groups, including miners, loggers, and farm workers. The gains made by the Wobblies were significant but far from permanent.\n\nThe IWW, because of its revolutionary stance, met with strong opposition from many Americans, including a number of more conservative labor leaders. The organization was weakened from within by disagreements over political philosophy, and many of its leaders were imprisoned during World War I (1914\u201318) for opposing American involvement in the war. By the beginning of the 1920s, the IWW was no longer a powerful force for labor, but its spirit and legacy lived on for many years. In his book The Labor Movement in the United States, John J. Flagler explained that, in later generations, \"a large share of the picket line marching music, the folk ballads of the organizing rallies, and the militant hymns which bind together a [union] membership were written with crusading zeal by long-forgotten Wobbly minstrels.\"\n\nTriumph and tragedy for garment workers\n\nDuring the early 1900s, immigrants continued to arrive in the United States in large numbers. Employers eagerly hired them, capitalizing on the new residents' poverty and desperation. Immigrants were so anxious to build new lives in America that they accepted any job, putting up with low wages, long hours, and poor conditions. Many immigrants, particularly young women, had jobs in the textile industry. They worked for companies that produced various types of cloth, or in the garment industry, turning cloth into clothing.\n\nThe workers in these factories were treated as little better than slaves. They were often required to pay for their supplies, including needles and thread, and rent out storage lockers and even the chairs they used. They worked between sixty-five and seventy-five hours a week for meager wages. Women earned about six dollars a week, less than what the men earned for the same type of work. Children earned less than the women did. They were not allowed to sing or even to speak to each other, and they were scolded if the foreman thought they took too long to use the bathroom.\n\nDuring the fall of 1909, many of the women workers of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company in New York City had reached the limit of their tolerance of such conditions. (\"Shirtwaist\" is a term referring to a woman's tailored blouse or dress made in the style of men's shirts.) The women began to explore membership in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). When word of union activity reached the employers, they fired those who had joined the union. The fired workers immediately formed a picket line, marching at the entrance to the factory carrying signs and shouting slogans. The ILGWU called for a strike. Several hundred workers went on strike, marching daily in front of the factory. The strikers suffered harassment and violence from hired thugs and police, with as many as twenty workers being arrested on a daily basis. Support for the workers came from the Women's Trade Union League (WTUL), an organization designed to help women join or form unions. The WTUL membership included well-known and highly respected society women, and their support of the striking garment workers attracted considerable attention and sympathy from the public.\n\nOn November 22, 1909, several weeks into the strike against the Triangle Shirtwaist Company, a mass meeting was attended by thousands of garment workers from many different companies. At the gathering, leading union activists, including Samuel Gompers, spoke to the frustrated workers, giving inspiring speeches about working together to achieve progress in the workplace. Clara Lemlich (1886\u20131982), a young Ukrainian garment worker who had been badly beaten during an earlier strike, stood at the podium to express her frustration. Fed up with all the talking, she called upon her fellow workers to take action and vote for a general strike of the entire New York City shirtwaist industry. The crowd cheered with approval.\n\nIn what became known as the \"Uprising of the 20,000,\" women from hundreds of shirtwaist manufacturers walked off the job. The general strike lasted until February 15, 1910, with strikers enduring a cold winter without any income. The strike ended when the factory, or \"shop,\" owners agreed to several of the workers' demands. They agreed to shorten the workweek to fifty-two hours and to improve wages and working conditions. Business owners also said they would no longer punish workers for engaging in strikes or other union activities. The shirtwaist workers' massive general strike gave women new power within the labor movement. Female workers\u2014including numerous immigrants, considered to be the most powerless members of society\u2014came to be seen as a force for change. In addition, the women leaders of the shirtwaist strike became significant players in the labor movement.\n\nThe triumph of the shirtwaist workers in 1910 was darkened by a tragedy just over a year later. On March 25, 1911, fire broke out on the eighth floor of the Triangle Shirtwaist Company building. Fueled by the large quantities of fabric on the work floors, the fire spread quickly throughout the eighth floor and up to the ninth. Hundreds of women found themselves trapped inside the building. The fire escapes were inadequate, no sprinkler systems had been installed, and the two elevators could only take a few people down at a time. One of the exits from the work area was unavailable because the doors had been locked from the outside, a practice designed to insure that workers did not steal fabric or take unauthorized breaks during the workday.\n\nFirefighters rushed to the scene, but their ladders and fire hoses did not reach high enough. Several hundred women were able to escape, some by the elevators, some on the stairs, and some by climbing up the stairs to the roof. Others were trapped in the fire. Still others seized the only option they could see, jumping out the windows and plummeting to their deaths on the street below. In all, 146 people, mostly women, died from the fire. The owners of the business went on trial, but they were acquitted of any responsibility in the deaths of their workers. The public reacted with outrage, demanding that improvements be made to protect workers' safety in the factories. Gradually, changes were made in New York and elsewhere to make workplaces safer.\n\nTextile workers strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts\n\nAfter the strike and the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory, workers all across the nation were inspired to rebel against their miserable working conditions. Laborers in Massachusetts had achieved a small victory when a state law had shortened the workweek from fifty-six to fifty-four hours. However, the employers had responded to the new law by cutting wages and increasing the speed of production. More than 25,000 workers, many of whom were new immigrants from various European countries, walked off the job in January 1912. The strikers had no unifying leaders, so organizers from the IWW were called in. Joseph Ettor (1885\u20131948) and Arturo Giovanitti (1882\u20131959) arrived, warning the workers to remain peaceful and unified. They organized committees to represent the multiple nationalities of the workers. They set up soup kitchens to feed the hungry strikers, and they conducted numerous parades and marches.\n\nCity and state officials responded to the strike by ordering the state militia to report to Lawrence. This sparked numerous heated and violent confrontations with the striking workers. When a riot broke out during one demonstration, a female worker named Anna LoPizzo was shot and killed. Despite the fact that they were miles away during the riot, Ettor and Giovanitti were charged with the crime and placed in jail. Other IWW leaders arrived to help with the strike, including a young woman named Elizabeth Gurley Flynn (1890\u20131964). Flynn had joined the Wobblies at the age of sixteen and had quickly proven herself to be a confident and passionate speaker, able to inspire and persuade large crowds of workers.\n\nThe strike wore on for weeks. In mid-February, some of the strikers sent their children via train to nearby communities where they could stay with friends or relatives until the strike was over. Knowing that striking workers could hold out much longer if their children were being cared for elsewhere, city officials ordered the police to stop further groups of children from boarding trains. The police surrounded a group of children and parents, using force to restrain the crowd. Children and parents were arrested, and several children were taken away from their families. When news of the police actions reached the public, people were furious, and sympathy for the workers increased. Soon after, the U.S. Congress began investigating the conditions at the American Woolen Company, the main employer in Lawrence. Backed into a corner, the American Woolen Company agreed to meet the workers' demands on March 12, 1912. The workers would receive an increase in wages, overtime pay, and the right to engage in union activity without being punished. The IWW organizers Ettor and Giovanitti were later tried and found not guilty.\n\nWomen in the Labor Movement\n\nThroughout much of the history of the labor movement, women were eager participants who were often forced to play a secondary role. Some early unions did not have women members simply because they represented a field in which women did not work. Many unions during the 1800s and well into the 1900s, however, had a policy of excluding women workers, leaving women to organize their own unions. Many male workers felt threatened by their female counterparts because employers could get away with paying women less money for the same work.\n\nIn the 1830s working women in several large cities formed societies to demand higher wages for such jobs as sewing, tailoring, and shoemaking. Many people disapproved of women taking part in union activity, considering it inappropriate and unladylike for women to engage in any type of activism. A number of people believed that women were inferior to men in skills and intelligence but superior in moral values. They thought that women needed to be kept out of the workplace and revered for their roles as wives and mothers.\n\nMost often, when women did participate in strikes, they did so alongside male workers. Female mill workers at the Cocheco mill in Dover, New Hampshire, became the first women to strike alone in the United States, without male workers, when they walked off their jobs in 1828. Their discontent stemmed from a new set of rules imposed by the managers. The women were fined for being late or talking on the job; forced to attend church on Sundays; and required to give two weeks' notice before quitting. Hundreds of women marched through the streets carrying signs, a display that shocked the citizens of Dover, who were unaccustomed to seeing women speak out in such ways. When the owners of the mill began to advertise for replacement workers, the striking women, afraid of losing their jobs, returned to work. None of their demands were met by the employers, and the leaders of the strike were fired and blacklisted. But the women of the Cocheco mill paved the way for future generations of women workers.\n\nIn 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York, the women's rights movement began with its primary goal being women's suffrage, or the right to vote. The quest for suffrage took more than seventy years, but the process gradually raised awareness of the rights of working women. The women's rights movement included among its demands an increase in the wages of all female workers. The Knights of Labor, a major national union established in 1869, welcomed women members beginning in 1881 and attempted to secure wages for women that were equal to those of men.\n\nThe Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), active in the early twentieth century, and the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), which rose to prominence in the 1930s, both had open membership policies and actively promoted women's membership in unions. They supported equality in theory, if not always in practice, and opposed discrimination in unions and in the workplace. Most leadership positions were held by men, however.\n\nAs unionization expanded during the 1950s and 1960s to include government workers, teachers, hospital staff, and others, the number of women in unions rose significantly. Reflecting the changes in society brought on by the women's liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s, women increasingly held positions of leadership in their unions. The presence of female labor leaders marked a shift in union concerns to include issues specific to women workers, including parental leave, or the right of a parent to take time off from a job when a child is born or adopted without having to worry about losing that job. By the late twentieth century, even as the number of overall workers represented by unions had decreased, female membership in unions had risen to historic highs, nearly equal in number to male membership.\n\nThe Ludlow massacre\n\nAlthough the Lawrence strike ended in victory for the workers, another strike the following year in a different part of the country ended in tragedy. In Ludlow, Colorado, coal miners struggled to feed their families and to escape injury in the dangerous mines. In the fall of 1913, about 10,000 miners, under the leadership of the United Mine Workers union, went on strike. John D. Rockefeller Jr. (1874\u20131960), owner of the coal mines, forced the striking workers to move out of their company-owned homes. In response, the workers set up a tent city on land adjacent to the mine property. At eighty-three years old, the tireless labor activist Mother Jones came to Ludlow to lead the strikers. Mother Jones was thrown out of the state and imprisoned multiple times, but she continued to come back to Ludlow to offer her support.\n\nAs the strike stretched on through the winter and into 1914, Rockefeller decided to take action. The militia was called in and armed guards hired to escort strikebreakers into the tent city. The guards attacked the miners, beating and arresting them. Occasionally, the troops would fire their guns randomly into the tents. As a result, the miners dug underground pits inside the tents to protect their families from the gunfire. On April 20, 1914, the troops encircled the tents and began shooting. Some miners shot back as their families took refuge in the underground pits. The troops then poured kerosene on some of the tents and set them on fire. Many people managed to escape the burning tents and the hail of gunfire, running into the nearby hills. But a tour of the wreckage the next day revealed that two women and eleven children had been trapped underground and killed by fire. A number of miners were killed by gunfire.\n\nNews of the Ludlow massacre shocked the nation and served to further spread the word about the unfair and dangerous working conditions many workers endured. Rockefeller generated a massive public relations effort, claiming that his workers had been content until union agitators arrived. However, the public became increasingly concerned about the amount of power wielded by big business. A growing number of journalists, sometimes described as muckrakers for their desire to dig up the harmful practices of corporations or governments, focused public attention on the powerlessness of the worker and the misdeeds committed by many large companies. Slowly, changes were made to limit the power of corporations.\n\nWorld War I and beyond\n\nLabor activism slowed down with the start of World War I (1914\u20131918) in Europe and amid rising speculation that the United States might enter the war. Many labor activists, particularly the socialists, vigorously opposed U.S. involvement in the war, and a number were jailed for their antiwar stance. They were charged with treason and espionage, accused of betraying and spying on their country. Other labor leaders supported the war effort, in part because the union cause had made some progress in recent years. Such leaders wanted to remain on good terms with lawmakers and other government officials. Recent advancements had included the creation of the U.S. Department of Labor in 1913. The new agency was designed to be an advocate for American workers. In addition, the Clayton Act, passed in 1914, made it more difficult for companies to obtain injunctions, or court orders, to end strikes.\n\nWhen the United States entered the war in 1917, many young men became soldiers, and the nation's workforce decreased. Wishing to continue manufacturing without interruption, the federal government made some concessions to laborers. This included support for collective bargaining, which is a negotiation between employers and union leaders for workers' wages and other contract terms. During the war years, the government also mandated hiring union workers for government contract work. Membership in the AFL grew significantly at that time, a circumstance that increased the union's negotiating power and boosted its profile in the corporate world.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1918, the United States endured the difficult transition from a wartime economy to one of peace. The war had sparked a dramatic increase in manufacturing, including production of weapons, ammunition, uniforms, and other necessary items. Many businesses had to find new sources of revenue after the fighting ended. Construction of new homes and other buildings increased, as did production of consumer goods. A high rate of inflation had raised prices for food, clothing, and many other goods, but workers' wages had remained the same. The year following World War I marked a period of intense labor unrest. Some four million workers participated in three thousand strikes, including a general strike in Seattle, Washington, that nearly brought the city to a halt before ending when the National Guard arrived. A lengthy and difficult strike by more than 300,000 steel workers ended with the strikers being forced to return to work without having any of their demands met.\n\nDespite the widespread dissatisfaction among workers and the large number of strikes, labor as a whole made few gains at this time, in part because the movement was divided by differing philosophies and the varied ethnicities and nationalities of union members. In addition, the employers had become increasingly determined to prevent union activity, and they readily resorted to violent tactics to break up strikes. Furthermore, the media and employers exploited a national fear of communism, known as the \"Red scare,\" by labeling union leaders as communist agitators and dangerous radicals. Communism is a political system whereby a dictatorial government controls the economy with the intention of eliminating class distinctions and private property. The Red scare significantly damaged the strength of all unions even though many union leaders had nothing to do with the Communist Party.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, corporate profits soared as businesses became bigger and bigger, merging and consolidating until a small percentage of people controlled the vast majority of the money. New and improved consumer goods, including automobiles, flooded the market, and many newly prosperous consumers purchased them. With the lawmakers, courts, and to some extent public opinion coming down on the side of big business, workers had little chance of winning any gains from their employers. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld decisions that opposed establishing a minimum wage for workers and made it easy for employers to obtain injunctions preventing strikes and other disruptive union activities.\n\nThe efforts of big business to protect their profits by keeping workers' wages low eventually had an unforeseen consequence, however. With so many workers earning low wages, more and more of the abundant new consumer goods sat on store shelves, unaffordable to many. Without enough buyers for their goods, many companies had to slow down production, lay off employees, and watch their profits begin to decline. By the end of the decade, the era of prosperity ended with a stunning crash.\n\nThe Great Depression\n\nIn the autumn of 1929, a number of factors combined to cause the U.S. economy, and that of numerous other nations as well, to collapse. The U.S. stock market crashed on October 29, 1929, precipitating a lengthy period of tremendous national hardship known as the Great Depression (1929\u201341). A number of people who had invested heavily in the stock market lost everything when it crashed, and millions of others lost their jobs in the months and years after the crash. Within three years of the collapse, factory production was half what it had been before the Depression began, and twelve million people were out of work in the United States. Thousands of banks failed, thereby wiping out the savings of many Americans. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their homes to foreclosure, a process whereby a bank or other lender takes possession of a home when the homeowners are unable to make loan payments. With so many people struggling to find work and to put food on the table, the labor movement stalled. Most workers fortunate enough to have jobs were extremely reluctant to risk losing their source of income by going on strike.\n\nU.S. President Herbert Hoover (1874\u20131964; served 1929\u201333), in office during the first three years of the Great Depression, took some steps to aid banks and other businesses. However, he offered no relief programs to ease the dire poverty that afflicted many citizens. Having promised to deliver aid to the nation and its citizens, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882\u20131945; served 1933\u201345) was elected president in November 1932. Upon taking office in early 1933, Roosevelt immediately began implementing a series of laws and programs, known as the New Deal, designed to help the economy recover and to give relief to citizens. The New Deal included numerous job programs, aid to farmers, and government regulations to stabilize the economy. Although the New Deal did not result in immediate recovery, it did provide jobs for millions of people, helped thousands of families hold on to their farms and homes, and sparked higher levels of factory production. The New Deal also offered a measure of hope and dignity to millions of destitute and desperate citizens.\n\nSome New Deal legislation benefited not just the population in general but the labor movement in particular. Roosevelt's National Industrial Recovery Act, passed in 1933, and the accompanying agency, the National Recovery Administration, both of which were known as the NRA, set standards for fair competition among businesses. Companies were not forced to adhere to the standards, but the positive publicity generated for those that did cooperate ultimately encouraged many to volunteer. Among the changes made by the NRA were the establishment of a maximum number of working hours as well as a minimum wage. The NRA also declared the right of employees to belong to a union and for those unions to engage in collective bargaining. In addition, the NRA called for a minimum working age of sixteen in most industries and eighteen for mining and logging companies. The changes made by the NRA were soon undone by the U.S. Supreme Court, however, which struck down the law in May 1935.\n\nThe U.S. Congress issued another victory for the labor movement just a short time later, passing the National Labor Relations Act, also called the Wagner Act, in July 1935. This law reinstated a worker's right to join a union and a union's ability to conduct collective bargaining. Workers could no longer be fired for union activity. The law also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an agency that would investigate conflicts between workers and employers and would assist workers in holding union elections. The NLRB continued to exist throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. A few years later, in 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) restored additional worker protections that had been initiated by the NRA. The FLSA mandated a minimum wage and maximum working hours and imposed limits on child labor. The law did not apply to all child workers, but it did significantly reduce the number of young people in mines and factories.\n\nA strike at General Motors\n\nAs Congress and the Roosevelt administration passed laws increasing the rights of American workers, the nation's large employers geared up for a battle. They spent millions of dollars each year to inhibit union activity. Much of this money went to hiring armed guards and building up a stockpile of weapons to use against strikers. Despite such actions, unions grew stronger, increasing their membership to pre-Depression levels. A number of leaders within the American Federation of Labor (AFL) began to focus on organizing unskilled laborers. These leaders formed the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) in 1935, and the following year they set their sights on the General Motors Corporation (GM).\n\nThe largest automaker in the world, GM employed some 250,000 workers at that time. The workers' union, the United Auto Workers (UAW), had met with extreme resistance from GM in the attempt to organize its employees. The workers refused to give up on their goals, however, complaining of low wages and an ever-increasing production pace. After a brief and successful strike at a GM plant in November 1936, the UAW called for another strike on December 30 at two of GM's Fisher Body plants in Flint, Michigan. They opted to use a strategy known as the sit-down strike. Rather than walk off the job, workers remained in the workplace for the duration of the strike, making it far more difficult for employers to bring in strikebreakers. Any attempt to forcibly remove the striking workers would most likely result in considerable damage to company equipment.\n\nSome five thousand workers participated in the sit-down strike, with tens of thousands of others joining picket lines and contributing to the strike in other ways. Volunteers prepared meals for the workers inside the plants. Other supporters, including members of CIO unions as well as a number of women who had husbands, fathers, and brothers inside the plants, helped by walking picket lines, distributing pro-labor literature, conducting demonstrations, and holding mass meetings. Genora Johnson Dollinger (1913\u20131995), a socialist and labor activist whose husband worked for GM, established the Women's Auxiliary. The organization was designed to enlist the help of women, both employees and supporters, in the strike. The Women's Auxiliary formed a first-aid center as well as a day-care center to free up mothers to walk on picket lines. It also educated women on public speaking and the history of the labor movement, preparing them for full participation in the male-dominated UAW. Dollinger also organized the Women's Emergency Brigade, a military-style group that offered support whenever picketers or other strikers clashed with police or GM-hired armed guards.\n\nGM fought back against the strikers, shutting off the heat in the plant where the workers were striking and preventing supporters from bringing food to the workers. Police officers assaulted crowds of picketers with tear gas and gunfire, attempting to gain control of the plant. The workers inside the plant held the officers back by hurling auto parts out the windows and by spraying the police with the plant's fire hoses. Michigan Governor Frank Murphy called in several thousand National Guard troops, but he ordered them to remain peaceful, stopping short of having them seize the plant.\n\nMeanwhile, the strikers planned to stop production at another plant, one that made Chevrolet engines. They misled the National Guardsmen into thinking they were taking over a different plant and then snuck quietly into the engine-producing plant, successfully gaining control without a battle. At that point, GM agreed that it would acknowledge the UAW as the workers' representative and would negotiate with the union.\n\nThe historic GM strike lasted for forty-four days and, although GM did not meet many of the workers' demands, its recognition of the UAW marked a significant change. Numerous other sit-down strikes, including 170 in March 1937 alone, followed at auto companies and other industries. The UAW went on to become a very powerful union, representing many thousands of workers in one of the nation's major industries. At the time of the GM sit-down strike, one of the UAW's officers was Walter Reuther (1907\u20131970), a labor pioneer who helped steer the autoworkers' union to its position of strength and prominence. Reuther dedicated his life to securing beneficial employment terms for union members, while also pursuing the larger causes of economic reform and social justice.\n\nThe buildup and aftermath of World War II\n\nIn spite of the CIO's role in the victorious GM strike, the AFL expelled the CIO unions from its organization in 1937. The CIO regrouped in 1938 as the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The new CIO was led by John L. Lewis, a mine worker's son who became a great hero to industrial workers. The CIO took an inclusive approach to union membership, welcoming workers at all skill levels and from all racial, ethnic, political, and national backgrounds. Women workers also played an important role in CIO unions. As a result of its open membership policies, the CIO grew rapidly during the mid-1900s, finally giving unskilled workers a voice in the workplace.\n\nAlthough the CIO promoted unity among workers of all types, many segments of the American workforce during the mid-twentieth century were marked by conflict and racial turmoil. African Americans in the South lived in a society strictly segregated, or separated, by race. Under a set of laws and policies known as Jim Crow, southern blacks were forced to ride in separate railway cars, to sit in the back of city buses, and to attend all-black schools. They were restricted as to where they could live, where they could work, and even where they could be buried. Many African Americans uprooted their families and headed North, hoping for better opportunities there. They soon realized that, while segregation was not the law in northern states, it still existed in many communities there. Racism was widespread and blacks were extremely limited in their job opportunities.\n\nEven as the buildup to World War II (1939\u201345) gave a tremendous boost to the defense industry and jobs became plentiful, African American workers were denied jobs in most defense plants. In some cases white workers went on strike to prevent employers from hiring black workers. African American labor leader A. Philip Randolph (1889\u20131979) attempted to correct this situation. He had organized the first black union, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, in 1925. In the early years of World War II, Randolph appealed to the U.S. government, asking it to intervene to end discrimination against black workers in the defense plants.\n\nIn 1941, shortly before the United States entered the war, Randolph informed the government of a planned march on Washington, D.C., to call attention to and protest discrimination in the defense industry. He promised that tens of thousands of demonstrators would gather in the nation's capital to demand equality in the workplace. Eager to avoid a protest that might further divide the nation on the eve of wartime, President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 on June 25, 1941, calling for the desegregation of defense companies that held government contracts. Randolph canceled the march, and numerous defense-related jobs were subsequently available to black workers.\n\nAs with World War I, the United States experienced a period of great prosperity after World War II. Many workers went on strike because they felt they were denied their share of the wealth. Ten thousand strikes were called in 1945 and 1946, the largest number in any two-year period in American history. Between the summer of 1945 and the summer of 1946, dozens of major strikes, each involving at least ten thousand employees, took place. The following year, Congress stepped in to limit the power of unions, undercutting the advantages workers had gained during the 1930s.\n\nIn 1947 Congress passed the Labor-Management Relations Act, also known as the Taft-Hartley Act, which defined some union actions, including sympathy strikes, as \"unfair labor practices.\" Under this law, union leaders had to promise under oath that they were not members of the Communist Party. In the aftermath of World War II, when the United States became locked in a decades-long struggle with the Soviet Union, communism was seen as one of the greatest threats to American democracy and to the security of U.S. citizens. The Taft-Hartley Act also gave the U.S. president the power to end strikes that were considered harmful to the nation's health and safety.\n\nPower and corruption\n\nIn 1955 two of the nation's largest labor organizations decided to join forces. Eighteen years after the AFL had expelled the CIO, the two groups reunited, forming the AFL-CIO. At that time, the unions that made up the AFL-CIO represented more than 85 percent of all union members in the United States. Unions had become large, well organized, and powerful. However, with that power came instances of corruption.\n\nA number of unions\u2014particularly those for the construction, trucking, and longshoremen industries\u2014had been tainted by the presence of organized crime among their leadership. A lengthy congressional investigation revealed that some union leaders had engaged in bribery, intimidation, mishandling of funds, and extortion (obtaining money from a person through threats).\n\nOne of Congress's primary targets was the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers of America, usually referred to simply as the Teamsters union. The Teamsters union was the largest in the nation, and the investigation revealed that its president, Dave Beck (1894\u20131993), had been misusing union funds for his own gain for many years. He and Jimmy Hoffa (1913\u20131975?), an international vice president of the union, had used threats and intimidation to further their aims both within the union and in dealing with employers and others they considered opponents.\n\nHoffa, who was associated with several organized-crime figures, was linked to various instances of violence. He allegedly stole millions of dollars from the union. Both Hoffa and Beck served prison terms, and the Teamsters were expelled from the AFL-CIO. In 1959 Congress passed the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act, to protect union members from corruption. The law mandated that union elections be regulated and union finances supervised by officials. Hoffa succeeded Beck as the Teamsters' president and later continued to head the union from prison. He disappeared under mysterious circumstances in 1975, and authorities suspect that he was murdered.\n\nA shift in focus\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, the United States experienced what some historians have called a second industrial revolution. Many companies began to use computers to automate functions that had previously been performed by people. Industrial machinery became automated as well, speeding up production and requiring fewer human operators. A massive machine was developed for mining coal and another for laying telephone cable. In numerous industries, productivity increased dramatically while the number of employees decreased. Corporate profits soared, but many workers faced a difficult transition: as more and more jobs were permanently eliminated, many people had to find jobs in other fields.\n\nDuring the period of great prosperity that followed World War II, increasing numbers of Americans owned their own homes, parked two cars in their garages, and purchased the latest household appliances, including washers and dryers, refrigerators, and televisions. With this expansion in consumer goods came a necessary expansion in the service industry. As a result, there was a greater need for salespeople, mechanics, and appliance repair technicians, and many other jobs. The increased need for workers in the service sector provided jobs for many of those industrial workers who had been displaced by technological advances.\n\nAs the service industry grew, many new unions arose to represent the workers in those fields as well as in other areas. Whereas most union activity in the past had concentrated on skilled and unskilled industrial laborers, during the late 1950s and 1960s the focus shifted to include office workers, teachers, hospital employees, and others. Many in these fields conducted strikes to improve their job security and wages and to protect their right to join a union. Government workers made gains during this period as well. In 1959 New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner (1910\u20131991; served 1954\u201365) gave city employees the right to join a union and bargain collectively. In the coming years, many other city and state governments followed suit. In 1962 President John F. Kennedy (1917\u20131963; served 1961\u201363) mandated that employees in the federal government's executive branch had those same rights.\n\nLa Causa: Farm Workers Organize\n\nWhile workers in one industry after another had successfully unionized throughout the 1800s and early 1900s, a large segment of American laborers remained unorganized well into the mid-twentieth century. Farm workers were among the poorest people in the nation. They worked twelve-hour days, earned very low wages, and endured punishing conditions in the fields. They paid to live in metal shacks that had no indoor plumbing, no heat, and no cooking facilities. They worked all day in fields without portable toilets or sanitary drinking water. Repeated attempts by farm workers to unionize and strike had been successfully thwarted by the large and powerful farming industry, known as agribusiness.\n\nA large percentage of farm workers were non-English-speaking immigrants, primarily from Mexico and the Philippines. Most were migrant workers, meaning they traveled from one region to another depending on the season and the type of work that needed to be done. Organizing a group of workers that didn't speak fluent English and didn't have permanent addresses proved very difficult. In addition, a surplus of people seeking farming work meant that workers who did strike could be easily replaced.\n\nIn 1962 a Mexican American community leader named C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez (1927\u20131993) began a three-year journey through California, traveling from one farming town to another. He and a group of organizers spoke to as many farm workers as possible, listening to their complaints and asking them to join a new organization, the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA). Around the same time, an organization called the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) had been organizing farm laborers in California as well.\n\nIn early September 1965, as the grapes ripened in the California valleys, AWOC led a group of grape pickers in the town of Delano on a strike for higher wages. AWOC asked for the assistance of the NFWA, which soon joined the strike. Among the leaders of the strike were Ch\u00e1vez and Dolores Huerta (1930\u2013), both of whom became heroes for their devotion to the cause of farm workers. The grape growers agreed early on to a modest wage hike, but the workers remained on strike, fighting for a larger goal: the recognition of their right to unionize. Characterizing their strike as a struggle for fairness and dignity, the striking workers drew the attention of the nation, particularly attracting the help of student activists and church groups.\n\nThe workers were devoted to the principles of nonviolence, a belief that echoed the activism of many social reformers during the civil rights movement in the South. The strikers also enlisted the support of other major unions, including the UAW. The strike was known as La Huelga, a Spanish term meaning \"the strike.\" It was also referred to by its leaders as La Causa, or \"the cause.\" Because so many of the migrant workers were from Mexico and other Latin American nations, La Causa represented not just farm workers' rights but those of all Hispanic Americans.\n\nIn 1966 NFWA and AWOC merged to form the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC), which later became known as the United Farm Workers of America (UFW). The following year, the strike leaders asked for the assistance of consumers nationwide, calling for a boycott of all table grapes sold in the United States. More than fourteen million Americans supported the boycott, refusing to buy any grapes at their local stores. The pressure of the ongoing strike and the national boycott eventually persuaded the grape growers of Delano to meet many of the UFWOC's demands. In 1969 Delano growers signed contracts with the workers guaranteeing fair hiring practices, increased wages, protection from the dangerous pesticides used on the crops, and medical benefits. The growers would also provide fresh drinking water and toilets in the fields.\n\nThe contracts for the grape pickers represented a significant victory for the UFWOC and for agricultural workers in general. Resistance to unions in the farming industry remained strong, however, and the UFW faced numerous challenges throughout the 1970s and beyond. Farm laborers, particularly migrant workers, continue to struggle for basic workers' rights.\n\nA downward trend\n\nUnion activity during the 1970s entered a long period of decline that continued through the end of the twentieth century and into the twenty-first. Due in part to energy crises and a resulting economic downturn in the 1970s, the number of strikes lessened. More and more labor conflicts were resolved not with strikes but through mediators, a neutral person who helps employers and employees reach agreements.\n\nSome significant strikes did occur during this period, however, including those of professional athletes, police officers, air traffic controllers, and teachers. One of the best-known strikes of this period was that of coal miners in Harlan County, Kentucky, the site of many previous bloody conflicts between miners and mine owners. Miners working for the Eastover Mining Company, owned by the large and powerful Duke Power Company, voted to join the United Mine Workers (UMW) union. Yet Duke refused to recognize or negotiate with the union. More than 150 miners went on strike protesting their low wages and dangerous working conditions. In response, the company immediately tried to bring in replacement workers, also sometimes called scabs. The striking miners fought hard to prevent the scabs from entering the mines, but they were no match for the police officers called in to protect the replacement workers. Duke earned a victory through the court system, getting a court order allowing only two picketing workers at each mine entrance, a number insufficient to stop the scab workers. A number of women in the community\u2014wives, sisters, friends, and mothers of the striking miners\u2014joined forces to support the workers. They tried physically to prevent the replacement workers from entering the mines, resulting in attacks and arrests by the police.\n\nThe strikers and their supporters suffered many setbacks during the long strike, including a number of violent assaults, but they continued to fight. After thirteen months, the Duke Power Company gave in and agreed to negotiate a contract through the UMW. Throughout the strike, the struggle was documented by a film crew led by Barbara Kopple. The resulting documentary, Harlan County, U.S.A., won an Academy Award and brought the plight of mine workers to a broad national audience.\n\nModern labor issues\n\nWorkers confronted a new set of issues as the twentieth century came to a close and the twenty-first century began. In many fields, further technological innovations enabled machines to do work that had been done by people, allowing companies to employ ever fewer workers. A number of companies began relying more on temporary, part-time, or contract workers. Such employees generally do not receive health insurance, vacation time, or other benefits. The implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and similar laws gave companies greater freedom to locate plants and factories in other countries, primarily Latin American and Asian nations, where the workers earn lower wages and have less power. In an increasingly popular practice known as outsourcing, companies kept their main operations in the United States but contracted with people, often low-wage workers in other countries, to perform certain functions. Such developments combined to significantly reduce the number of desirable full-time jobs available to workers in the United States, making existing jobs less secure.\n\nAs the twentieth century concluded, many large corporations remained determined to limit the power of unions or to prevent their employees from unionizing. The vast majority of workers were not represented by unions. Those who were represented continued the struggle to protect the same basic rights that workers had sought for hundreds of years: acceptable wages, safe job conditions, job security, and the right of unions to negotiate with employers.\n\nA significant number of workers, primarily immigrants, remain vulnerable to unethical corporations that exploit them. Immigrants without proper legal documentation to work in the United States accept low wages and dangerous working conditions. They do this out of a sense of desperation and a fear of being exposed to the authorities and deported out of the country. Such workers are often prevented from organizing into unions because their employers threaten them with firing and deportation. In several large cities in the United States, factories still exist that resemble those of the nineteenth century. Known as sweatshops, these factories fail to adhere to modern-day standards for worker safety and a sanitary environment. Sweatshop employees, most of whom are immigrant women, work ten hours a day, six days a week, earning far less than their American-born counterparts at other factories. Child labor continues as well, with some underage workers in sweatshops and many others working as farm laborers.\n\nA nationwide immigrants' rights movement emerged during the winter and spring of 2006 in response to controversial proposed legislation regarding immigration. In a series of well-attended protests in cities across the country, activists for immigrants' rights called attention to the important role that the immigrant population plays in the U.S. economy. Protesters urged the government to give undocumented immigrants more protection under the law.\n\nThe history of the labor movement has been cyclical, with periods of great union strength and victory alternating with periods of weakness and loss. For the most part, American workers in the twenty-first century, union or nonunion, work under safer conditions and have far more benefits than their counterparts a century ago. The battles fought by labor unionists have assured many workers such things as medical benefits, paid holidays, a measure of job security, and a safe working environment. Taken together, the victorious moments for unions have added up to significant, positive changes for American workers.\n\nFor More Information\n\nBOOKS\n\nCahn, William.

FOTLU veered away from electoralism and sought more efficient organization and a more narrow focus than the more expansive labor reform group, the Knights of Labor. There were both socialists and nonsocialists among FOTLU's founding members, yet the Federation as a whole helped to consolidate the trend toward an increasingly nonradical \"pure and simple\" unionism in the U.S. labor movement.\n\nTimeline\n\n1861: Serfs in Russia are emancipated.\n\nSerfs in Russia are emancipated. 1871: U.S. troops in the West begin fighting the Apache nation.\n\nU.S. troops in the West begin fighting the Apache nation. 1874: Gold is discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota.\n\nGold is discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota. 1879: F.

Nine people are killed\u2014two of them children\u2014and sixty more are injured.\n\nEvent and Its Context\n\n\"We have numberless trades unions, trades' assemblies or councils, Knights of Labor and various other local, national, and international unions,\" declared the call for the national conference that formed FOTLU. \"But great as has been the work done by these bodies, there is vastly more that can be done by a combination of all these organizations in a federation of trades.\"\n\nForward Steps\n\nThe Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions came into being in a gymnasium at the Turner Hall in downtown Pittsburgh. The Turnverein, or \"Turners,\" were German-American social and athletic societies; many of the pioneers of the American labor movement in this period were German-American, though many others were Irish-American, these being the two largest immigrant groups at the time. In its early incarnation, the federation called in 1882 for the celebration of Labor Day on the first Monday in September. The organization also called for work stoppages and demonstrations on 1 May 1886 in favor of the eight-hour workday (initiating May Day, the international workers' holiday). The AFL and its predecessor, however, are best known for organizing the most durable union federation in U.S. history, providing an effective approach for improving the wages, hours, and working conditions of its members.\n\nOver a hundred delegates attended the founding convention, representing close to half a million members. Represented were eight national and international trade unions: 14 from the Typographical Workers, 10 from the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, 8 from the Molders, 6 from the Glass Workers, 5 from the Cigar Makers, and 5 from the Carpenters. Also represented were the central labor councils of 11 cities, 42 local unions, 3 district assemblies, and 46 local assemblies of the Knights of Labor, which at that time was the largest labor organization in the country. The Knights organized workers into reform struggles, social events, and educational efforts as well as trade union activities. For several years many workers belonged both to the Knights and to the Federation, though eventually the two groups became rivals.\n\nSolidarity and Class Struggle\n\nThose in attendance at the conference included 68 delegates from Pittsburgh, many of whom were members the Knights of Labor, whose membership included both people who were in unions and those who were not. One controversy arose around whether the new Federation should consist exclusively of people who were already members of labor unions. In this period, and for many years afterward, only skilled workers were able to build and sustain trade unions that were organized around a specific craft. A decision to make the Federation an exclusively union organization would restrict its membership to skilled workers. Many delegates agreed with the comments of one that \"I wish this Federation broad enough to encompass all working people in its folds.\" An African American delegate from Pittsburgh explained, \"We have in the city of Pittsburgh many men in our organization who have no particular trade, but should not be excluded from the Federation. \u2026 I speak more particularly of my own people and declare to you that it would be dangerous to skilled mechanics to exclude from this organization the common laborers, who might, in an emergency, be employed in positions they could readily qualify them to fill.\"\n\nThe inclusive spirit of these delegates won the day not only in the selection of a name, but also in the preamble, which was retained in 1886 when the group was reorganized as the American Federation of Labor. The preamble cited the \"struggle between capital and labor\" and forecast \"disastrous results\" if the \"toiling millions\" did not \"combine\" in the struggle for protection from oppression: \"Conforming to the old adage, 'In union there is strength,' the formation of a Federation embracing every trade and labor organization in North America, a union founded upon a basis as broad as the land we live in, is our only hope.\"\n\nSamuel Gompers of the Cigar Makers Union was nominated to be president of the Federation, but so was Richard Powers of the lake seaman's union. The Pittsburgh Commercial-Gazette ran an article explaining the contest in this way: \"It is thought that an attempt will be made to capture the organization for Gompers as the representative of the Socialists, and if such an attempt is made, whether it succeeds or not, there will likely be some lively work, as the delegates opposed to Socialism are determined not to be controlled by it.\" In fact, such internal conflict was side-stepped when both Gompers and Powers withdrew from the race in favor of John Jarrett of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (with Gompers and Powers both becoming vice presidents). The organization's secretary was Frank K. Foster.\n\nSocialists\u2014those favoring replacement of capitalism by social ownership and democratic control over the economy\u2014were influential in the early Federation, but Gompers later explained that the newspaper allegation of his being part of a socialist conspiracy was a slander based partly on a misunderstanding. \"In those early days not more than half a dozen people had grasped the concept that economic organization and control over economic power were the fulcrum which made possible influence and power in all other fields,\" he later wrote in his autobiography. This was the founding premise on which the AFL was later built, but Gompers noted that the lines between socialists and trade unionists were \"very blurred.\"\n\nThe Rise of Pure and Simple Unionism\n\nDuring the 1880s, Gompers became known not as an advocate of socialism but as an advocate of what became known as \"pure and simple trade unionism.\" This meant the organization of workers into unions that would focus on workplace struggles around issues of higher wages, fewer hours of work, and improved working conditions, with the exclusion of radical social causes, whether socialism or anything else. When asked what the labor movement wanted, Gompers once replied simply, \"More.\" Yet Pennsylvania Federation of Labor president James Maurer has left a record of one of Gompers's many \"pure and simple\" union speeches in which he contended that the needs and desires of the workingman continue to escalate with gain that is won: \"After that he wants two dollars and more time for leisure, and he struggles to get it. Not satisfied with two dollars he wants more; not only two and a quarter, but a nine-hour workday. And so he will keep on getting more and more until he gets it all or the full value of all he produces.\"\n\nFOTLU included members and some unions that were affiliated with the expansively reformist Knights of Labor, and it was formally on record as favoring close relations with the larger organization. Yet, in the minds of many trade unionists, FOTLU represented \"a broad and enduring basis,\" as secretary Frank Foster put it, for organization because in contrast to the Knights, it drew members together along \"the trade line,\" providing \"greater feasibility and \u2026 economic soundness\" in facing \"the growing power of associated capital.\" Rather than relying on lobbying and elections to secure gains, \"in the world of economic reform the working classes must depend upon themselves for the enforcement of measures as well as for their conception,\" as Foster put it. In 1886 FOTLU was reorganized as the American Federation of Labor to advance more effectively this orientation, and soon afterward it surpassed the Knights of Labor as the dominant force in the labor movement.\n\nKey Players\n\nFoster, Frank K. (1854-1909): Active in the International Typographical Union, Foster had also been involved in the eight-hour leagues, the Workingmen's Party of the United States, and the International Labor Union. He turned away from active participation in the Knights of Labor to focus his efforts on the formation of the American Federation of Labor.\n\nGompers, Samuel (1850-1924): Prominent in the Cigar Makers Union, Gompers became the long-time (1886-1924) and increasingly conservative president of the American Federation of Labor, a spokesman for the \"pure and simple union\" orientation that was initially developed by his colleague, Adolph Strasser. In his later years Gompers became an outright opponent of socialism (though he never lost his admiration for Karl Marx, whose outlook he viewed as consistent with his own \"pure and simple\" unionism).\n\nJarrett, John (1843-1918): Born in Wales, Jarrett became an iron puddler and emigrated to the United States in 1862, where he became a member of the Sons of Vulcan (a predecessor of the steel workers union, established in 1860). Returning to Britain in 1868, he became associated with the cautious trade unionism of John Kane in the Amalgamated Ironworkers Association. In 1872 Jarrett returned to the United States, where he became a vice president of the Sons of Vulcan and a founder of the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers, of which he became president in 1880. While accepting the office of president of FOTLU, he pulled his organization out of it in 1881 when the Federation failed to endorse a high tariff. In 1883 he left the union, and although he continued to support the labor movement for some years, he became a lobbyist for the Tin Plate Association. A longtime supporter of the Republican Party, he was appointed U.S. consul to Birmingham, England in 1889-1892, after which he took a position as employment agent for the Carnegie Steel Company (which had just destroyed the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers in the Homestead Steel Strike).\n\nMcGuire, Peter J. (1852-1906): An American-born worker who whose initial involvement in socialist politics was as a member of the First International, McGuire left the Socialist Labor Party in the 1880s to become a founder and general secretary of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and a founder of the AFL. He is often credited for being involved in the creation both of Labor Day (1882) and May Day (1886), although, as with Gompers, his socialist commitments faded with the passage of time.\n\nSee also: American Federation of Labor; Eight-hour Day Movement; Haymarket Riot; International Labor Union; Knights of Labor.\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nBrooks, Thomas R.

Here we feature three prominent advocates for the manual worker: Frances Perkins, Samuel Gompers, and C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nFrances Perkins (1880-1965)\n\nClara E. Sipprell (1885-1975)\n\nPhotograph, gelatin silver print, 1952, NPG.77.60\n\nNational Portrait Gallery,\n\nSmithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.\n\nThat Frances Perkins devoted so much of her life to the plight of the American worker is noteworthy in itself. However, the fact that she also blazed a trail for women in American politics makes her accomplishments all the more extraordinary. While organizers like Samuel Gompers attempted to enact labor reform from within the labor community, Perkins attacked the same problems from the level of city, state, and finally national government.\n\nPerkins was a pioneer in women's issues in addition to her role in labor reform. Originally born Fanny Coralie Perkins, she later changed her first name to Frances because she thought people would take her more seriously. In later life she shocked many in polite society when she refused to take her husband's name after marriage.\n\nPerkins's interest in social reform began during her years at Mt. Holyoke College, when she joined the National Consumers League, a group organized to improve labor conditions through consumer pressure. After college she became a teacher and spent holidays working in settlement houses and other social service organizations. In 1909 she won a fellowship to study at the New York School of Philanthropy, where she met many of the city's leading reformers. In 1910 she received a master's degree in social work from Columbia University. At the same time, as head of the New York City Consumers League, she monitored workers' conditions and lobbied the state legislature on their behalf. When Perkins's acquaintance Al Smith won the New York governorship in 1918, he invited her to sit on the governing board of the state labor department. In that capacity she became known as an expert in both industrial regulation and labor-management mediation.\n\nIn 1928, Franklin D. Roosevelt, recently elected governor of New York, appointed Perkins as head of the state labor department. For a woman to assume such a post was unprecedented. It was also the beginning of a close working relationship between Roosevelt and Perkins. Four years later, after Roosevelt was elected president, he invited Perkins to serve as his secretary of labor. During their years together, Perkins was an integral part of Roosevelt's response to the Great Depression, and an advocate of social security, wage and hour regulation, and the abolition of child labor. She distanced herself from labor leaders but earned their respect as she deftly managed some of the era's most volatile labor disputes.\n\nAs Perkins rose in prominence and position, she was forced to become more acutely aware of her status as a woman. After all, at the time she joined the New York state government, women in many states were still two years away from being allowed to vote. As a consequence, she was very careful about her demeanor and appearance when interacting with her male colleagues. On the subject of dress, she once remarked: \"Many good and intelligent women do dress in ways that are very attractive and pretty, but don't particularly invite confidence in their common sense, integrity or sense of justice.\"\n\nBy the time of Roosevelt's death in 1945, Perkins was ready to retire. However, she remained active for several more years, serving on the United States Civil Service Commission, lecturing, and writing. Her best-known book is the memoir The Roosevelt I Knew (1946). After 1957, she served as a visiting professor at Cornell University.\n\nSamuel Gompers (1850-1924)\n\nUnidentified photographer\n\nPhotograph, gelatin silver print, 1921, NPG.77.202\n\nNational Portrait Gallery,\n\nSmithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the power and scale of American industry grew during the nineteenth century, working conditions for most Americans underwent radical change. Mechanized, large-scale factories staffed by unskilled laborers gradually came to replace specialized craftsmen and small workshops. Trade unions, which had been designed to serve the older system, initially failed to adapt to the new conditions. Samuel Gompers, more than any other individual, helped to modernize the unions, organize them on a national scale, and open their doors to unskilled as well as skilled workers.\n\nGompers began his career as a cigarmaker after quitting school at age ten. In 1863, his family moved to New York City from their native England. In the multi-ethnic cigar factories of New York, the young Gompers received an informal education on the latest social theories coming from Europe. He and others discussed the industrial changes taking place and recognized the need for an improved workers' union. Gradually, Gompers began to form a plan of action.\n\nThe first task, beginning in 1877, was to revitalize the Cigarmakers' Union. Led by Gompers, the union tightened its organization, raised dues, and articulated a clear, limited agenda. Soon other trades began to follow the cigarmakers' example. But the real accomplishment came in 1881, when Gompers helped organize what was to become the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which united the various trade unions under one roof. To minimize dissension, Gompers required that each trade be represented by only one union, and that within each union the national organization should prevail over local chapters. Gompers himself served as president of the AFL every year but one until his death in 1924.\n\nThe AFL, while not the only union organization in America, was the largest and most mainstream. Though Gompers adopted ideas from socialism and communism, he never joined any political organization himself, nor did he seek to radically alter the American economic or political system. His goals for the union were clear and limited: in his words, \"more wages, more leisure, more liberty\" for workers through collective action. Gompers served on many official commissions, including the Council of National Defense during World War I, and was known for his conservative stances. Indeed, his harshest criticism often came from leftist militants who saw him as too much the creature of powerful industrialists.\n\nGompers was an excellent speaker, and after 1881 he gave much of his time to making speeches on behalf of labor. Historians agree that his success was due largely to his power of persuasion and his ability to articulate ideas and turn them into practical goals. He also wrote several books, including an autobiography, Seventy Years of Life and Labor.\n\nC\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez (1927-1993)\n\nEarl Mayan (dates unknown)\n\nPencil and gouache on board, 1969, T/NPG.93.275.03\n\nNational Portrait Gallery,\n\nSmithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\n\n\nLife was difficult for the young C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez, and his childhood prepared him for a career as one of America's most prominent labor organizers and civil rights activists. Ch\u00e1vez was born on a small family farm near Yuma, Arizona. When his parents lost their land in the Great Depression, the Ch\u00e1vez family joined the growing mass of migrant workers in California. Despite frequent moves and primitive living conditions, Ch\u00e1vez managed to reach the seventh grade.\n\nAfter serving in the navy for two years during World War II, Ch\u00e1vez settled in California and became active in the Community Service Organization (CSO), a support group for Latinos. From 1952 to 1962, he organized chapters, led voter registration drives, and worked with needy families. In the process, he began to see unionization as an important means for bettering the lot of California's Latino migrant farm workers. In 1962, after the CSO would not support such an effort, Ch\u00e1vez left the CSO to establish the National Farm Workers Association (now the United Farm Workers of America) in California's agriculturally rich central valley.\n\nIn 1965, the new union joined a strike begun by Filipino workers against grape growers in the region. The strike, which lasted five years, slowly gained the support of other workers, the public, and national leaders such as Robert F. Kennedy. Ch\u00e1vez's idea for a grape and wine boycott was particularly successful in winning public support and disrupting the local economy. At the strike's conclusion, twenty-three local growers had signed a contract with the field workers. For Ch\u00e1vez, the strike signified more than a labor dispute; it was a fight for social justice. Taking inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr., Ch\u00e1vez advocated nonviolent protest and strict dedication to la causa. His vision and leadership made him a hero for many, but his failure to separate community from labor issues occasionally weakened his role as a union organizer.\n\nAfter 1970, conditions for migrant workers slowly improved, though the workers' way of life remained difficult. California's 1975 Agricultural Labor Relations Act, which formally granted farm workers the right to collective bargaining, represented an important milestone. Up to the end of his life, Ch\u00e1vez was a strong, and often controversial, voice in the constant struggle to improve the lives of farmworkers and of the entire Latino community.\n\nThe Smithsonian's National Museum of American History has several objects belonging to Ch\u00e1vez on display, including his jacket with a \"No Grapes\" button attached.\n\nLINKS\n\nGeneral\n\nhttp://www.kentlaw.edu/ilhs/ A compendium of information about labor issues, from the Illinois Labor History Society http://juteux.net/rory/labor.html Labor History bibliography http://www.iisg.nl/~w3vl/ Labour and Business History, from WWW Virtual Library http://www.albany.edu/history/history316/LaborMovementHistory1.html A short history of American Labor http://www.labornet.org/ LaborNet http://www.aflcio.org AFL-CIO http://iww.org/ Industrial Workers of the World http://www.dol.gov United States Department of Labor\n\nFrances Perkins\n\nhttp://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/perkins.htm Perkins biography, Department of Labor http://www.ssa.gov/history/fp25.html A Dream Translated to Reality, article by Frances Perkins http://www.ssa.gov/history/ Social Security History Page http://www.natlconsumersleague.org/ National Consumers League\n\nSamuel Gompers\n\nhttp://www.let.rug.nl/usa/B/gompers/gompers.htm Gompers biography http://www.kentlaw.edu/ilhs/gompers.htm Gompers biography, from the Illinois Labor History Society\n\nC\u00e9sar Ch \u00e1 vez"}]}
