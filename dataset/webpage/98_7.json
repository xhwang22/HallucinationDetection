In this regard, there has been a considerable focus on the age of selection into structured talent development pathways and the nature of the experience once players have been recruited. Given the economic and reputational currency associated with developing professional footballers in particular, it is unsurprising that professional football clubs continue to invest significant financial resources into their academy structures. Understandably, this recruitment policy has attracted substantial attention within the media and research community, with ethical concerns arising surrounding the impact early selection may have on the welfare and the experiences of the young players within the pathway. The aim of this perspective article was to critically consider the research underpinning the early engagement practises of football clubs and the extent to which, and how, the pathway can provide players with the most appropriate starting point for their development. This evidence points to the need to look beyond the prevalent \u2018early specialisation vs. diversification\u2019 debate in youth sport towards a consideration of an early engagement perspective that reflects the biopsychosocial influences on talent development and the socio-political environment that influences decisions. We provide practical recommendations focused on the quality of the early engagement experience.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe development of talent in football is big business and, across nations, significant financial resources are invested in identifying and developing talented young players. For example, some football academies in the United Kingdom are now adopting an approach whereby players as young as six are required to attend multiple weekly training sessions, with formal club registration beginning at 9 years of age (Elite Player Performance Plan, 2011; Read et al., 2016). This has led to suggestions of \u201cpremature professionalisation\u201d of youth sport to the detriment of the young players involved. Of the 265 million people that regularly play football, only 0.04% play in a professional league (Haugaasen and Jordet, 2012) and even the best performing young players are unlikely to maintain progression and become elite senior players (S\u00e6ther, 2018). Furthermore, the complexity of talent identification in sport is compounded by the methods used to select young players into professional academies. Typically, young players are identified and then selected based on subjective analysis by coaches on the factors thought to underpin senior performance (e.g., physical, biological or performance determinants; Williams and Reilly, 2000) without due consideration to the non-linear and dynamic nature of the pathway and the non-stable nature of these factors (Abbott and Collins, 2004). Indeed, the importance of a biopsychosocial approach to talent development has been stressed (e.g., Bailey et al., 2010), and football clubs must consider their role in the biopsychosocial development of players. Reflecting this, the purpose of this perspective article was to critically consider early engagement practises in football and the extent to which, and how, the pathway can provide players with the most appropriate starting point for their development. Framed within the socio-political context of the Irish-UK footballing landscape, the discussions within this perspective article are delimited to male football.\n\nThe Socio-Political Realities of Modern Football\n\nIn addition to the complexity of predicting talent at a young age, and reflective of the biopsychosocial approach described earlier, the cultural and societal influences within football must be addressed to account for the complex system that young players experience, and the cultural milieu generated by the sport, context, and even gender. Scouts and coaches base their selection on the extent to which a young player possesses the skills and ability to compete in a specific cultural context or philosophy (Sarmento et al., 2018). The competitive landscape in football also makes talent identification and selection a strategic and tactical decision (Relvas et al., 2010) and there are certainly systemic drivers that force clubs to select young players. Given the cost of buying senior players and the competitive marketplace, it makes sense that professional academies contract large numbers of players at a young age. For example, the player may turn into the next superstar and, for a relatively small outlay, the club will benefit both on (performance) and off (financially) the pitch. Reflecting football's competitive nature, identifying potentially talented players and selecting them at a relatively young age means that they are not available to another rival club. Given the finite coaching resources, money, facilities, and exposure to competition available to all clubs, decisions of who and when to select and deselect on the pathway are inevitable. However, the socio-political landscape of modern-day football is evolving, and clubs must be systematic, careful, and deliberate in designing player development policies. Understandably, there is growing concern about the influence of academy experiences on young players, especially on those released at various, and often early, points on the pathway (Relvas et al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2020). Significant academic (Brown and Potrac, 2009) and anecdotal (Calvin, 2018) attention has been paid to the deselection experiences of young footballers, with feelings of anxiety, fear, humiliation, and depression experienced by some young players following deselection. Reflecting the professionalisation of football academies, which have also been referred to as \u201cfootball factories\u201d (Green, 2009, p.7), some football clubs have been accused of viewing young players as commodities and performing bodies that are disposed of once it is deemed that they do not have the necessary qualities and attributes to succeed at the senior level (Brown and Potrac, 2009). Against this basis, there have been calls to reconsider the pathway experience of aspiring footballers and consider ethical issues and the impact of selection and deselection issues within these environments. There is a growing literature base that emphasises the influences of biopsychosocial factors on talent development with recommendations to delay talent identification (i.e., the age of identification) until later in the pathway, to widening talent development opportunities, and expose young athletes to a range of diverse activities across youth sport (Till and Baker, 2020). It may also be that the distinction between early selection and early specialisation, in football academies for example, is less understood and in reality, the context is more complex than the \u201cdiversification is good, specialisation is bad\u201d argument that is often cited (cf. Baker et al., 2020).\n\nEarly Specialisation or Early Focus?\n\nAlthough early sport specialisation has become a popular research area, a universally agreed definition does not currently exist (Jayanthi et al., 2020; Mosher et al., 2020). Initially, Jayanthi et al. (2013) defined early specialisation as \u201cyear-round intensive training in a single sport at the exclusion of all other sports.\u201d Jayanthi et al. (2015) later introduced an early specialisation scale, whereby an athlete could be deemed low, medium, or highly specialised based upon three criteria. The authors proposed that the degree of specialisation was influenced by whether the athlete (a) participated in year-round intensive training (more than 8 months per annum), (b) selected one main sport, and (c) quit all other sports to focus on their main sport. Reflecting inconsistencies in terminology throughout the talent development literature (cf. Dohme et al., 2017) a lack of clarity remains, and, in this case, the scale was subsequently questioned because it failed to include all elements that affect an early specialisation pathway, such as training volume and intensity, the type of sport (i.e., individual or team-sport), or the child's autonomy in training (Jayanthi et al., 2020).\n\nDespite the lack of a consensus statement on what constitutes early specialisation (Mosher et al., 2020), and perhaps in response to the structure of competitive youth sport, many researchers and practitioners propose early diversification rather than specialisation as the most appropriate foundation for sporting success (i.e., Bridge and Toms, 2012; DiFiori et al., 2014; Myer et al., 2015; LaPrade et al., 2016; Read et al., 2016; Wilhelm et al., 2017; G\u00fcllich et al., 2020). The International Olympic Committee published a statement (see Bergeron et al., 2015) citing generalised concerns associated with youth athletic talent development, including an increased risk of overtraining, burnout and injury. The committee recommended an early diversity of athletic exposure between and within sports, despite acknowledging the need for more definitive evidence. Although there is significant research attesting to the benefits of a diversified early engagement in sport (i.e., Jayanthi et al., 2013; C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Vierimaa, 2014; DiFiori et al., 2014), much of the suggestions on early specialisation have been guided by research that is retrospective in design and lacking specificity to football (i.e., G\u00fcllich and Emrich, 2006; Law et al., 2007; Wall and C\u00f4t\u00e9, 2007; Fraser-Thomas et al., 2008; Moesch et al., 2011). The latter point is important, as an evidence-based, sport-specific early specialisation definition is needed before strategies for optimal youth participation, injury prevention, and long-term health and performance can be prescribed (Jayanthi et al., 2020).\n\nSome research has attempted to address the risks associated with youth participation in high-level football. A systematic review by Jones et al. (2019) concluded that high-level youth players have a high probability of sustaining a time-loss injury and, consequently, lose large portions of their seasonal development. However, no research within the review included a matched comparator group of diversified sports players tracked prospectively to compare training, match and overall injury incidence rates. In fact, research by Frome et al. (2019) found that specialised high-level youth footballers were less likely to report any previous sports-related injury than non-specialised athletes. Zibung and Conzelmann (2013) and Sieghartsleitner et al. (2018) also reported that to succeed within the Swiss national football system, a vast amount of domain-specific learning activities within early sport participation is recommended. The paucity and low quality of research to date was highlighted in a recent systematic review of youth sports specialisation and musculoskeletal injury (Fabricant et al., 2016). The review included only three appropriate studies, two retrospective studies and one case-control study. Consequently, there is a need for comparative and prospective research to clarify the relationship between youth sports specialisation and musculoskeletal injury (Fabricant et al., 2016).\n\nAlthough junior success does not necessarily lead to senior success in football (Collins et al., 2016; Taylor and Collins, 2019), there is evidence that early and prolonged engagement in sport-specific activities is related to senior performance. For example, hours spent in football-specific team practise at an early age is associated with expert levels of achievement in English (Ford et al., 2009; Ford and Williams, 2012; Roca et al., 2012), Swiss (Zibung and Conzelmann, 2013; Sieghartsleitner et al., 2018), and Norwegian (Haugaasen et al., 2014) footballers. Although early diversification can be a pathway to elite performance (Coutinho et al., 2016), a diversified early experience has not been shown to be a significant influence on the attainment of expertise in football (Ward et al., 2007; Ford et al., 2009; Ford and Williams, 2012). In fact, the hours accumulated in football-specific play and practise during childhood and youth is a strong predictor for perceptual-cognitive expertise in football (Roca et al., 2012). Methodological limitations (i.e., retrospective study designs, limited to specific cultural contexts) in this research have to be acknowledged, and there is a need for longitudinal and prospective research that examines the microstructure of the different football activities that support development to better inform the design of early experiences in the football pathway (Coutinho et al., 2016; Davids et al., 2017). However, given the socio-political nature of modern-day professional football, and the systemic drivers influencing academy practises mentioned earlier, it is very unlikely that such a prospective, longitudinal and comparative experiment that could provide meaningful insight into the specialisation vs. diversification debate in a football-specific context could ever take place.\n\nOptimising Early Engagement in a Specialised Pathway\n\nZibung and Conzelmann (2013) suggest that football requires large quantities of football-specific learning activities during childhood to achieve high footballing performance levels at the age of peak performance. At some stage, a high potential player must prioritise football to maximise his development and fulfil his potential. Baker et al. (2020) highlight the lack of evidence to identify the appropriate time for young athletes to prioritise their chosen sport in an attempt to fulfil their potential. Despite this, Hendry and Hodges (2018) noted that senior professional footballers report that they started playing football early in childhood and, although they did not specialise exclusively in football during childhood, they devoted the majority of their time to it. An analysis from multiple football nations identified that elite players started their participation in an elite football academy at 11\u201312 years of age (cf. Ford et al., 2012), which is in contrast to current UK football academy practises which formally begin at age nine (Richardson et al., 2004; Read et al., 2016). As there is a lack of empirical evidence to support early childhood recruitment practises, and given that research appears to favour later selection at around age 11\u201312, it could be suggested that the age at which academies recruit players should be delayed until early adolescence. C\u00f4t\u00e9's Developmental Model of Sport Participation suggests that at the end of primary school (around age 13), children should have the opportunity to either specialise in their favourite sport or to continue in sport at a recreational level (C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Vierimaa, 2014). As this investment begins, support must be provided to manage the diverse sporting commitments of young players. This presents an interesting opportunity within a football academy where a young player is often required to commit to 2\u20134 days of training/match-play per week (Richardson et al., 2004; Mitchell et al., 2020). Given that children aged 5\u201317 are recommended to engage in 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily (World Health Organization Physical Activity Recomendations, 2020), an academy player could be encouraged to engage in a range of activities outside the academy programme. For some, this might allow the opportunity to participate in a different sport or activity; for others, it might provide them with the opportunity to play football in a different setting, such as in school or recreationally that would meet their psychosocial needs (Bailey et al., 2010). Given the physical activity recommendations and the current commitment required by young academy players, if managed appropriately, there would appear to be ample time to engage in age, stage, and developmentally appropriate activities in addition to the structured academy programme. Of course, as intensity and physical demands increase, training loads should be monitored to maximise athletic development and minimise the risk of overtraining and injury, especially during rapid growth periods (Wrigley et al., 2012; Jones et al., 2019; Materne et al., 2020).\n\nA key aim of the talent development process is to provide youth athletes with a suitable learning environment to accelerate or realise their potential (Till and Baker, 2020). Kelly et al. (2020) suggested that moving youth footballers into an advanced learning environment may be associated with positive performance outcomes for high potential players. A similar approach is taken in academia, whereby teachers often move high potential students into more advanced educational settings to provide greater learning opportunities (Kelly et al., 2020). G\u00fcllich et al. (2017) and G\u00fcllich (2019) reported that higher amounts of football-specific free play and structured practise in other sports during childhood, rather than larger quantities of coach-led football practise, differentiated German players at the highest professional standard. However, both studies' findings are restricted by methodological limitations, including retrospective recall bias, cultural limitations, and neither study recorded the \u201cquality\u201d of practise and free play. Contrastingly, a plethora of research (with similar retrospective recall bias limitations) exists to suggest that large amounts of football-specific practise and unstructured free play during childhood contributes to the development of expert performance (Ford et al., 2009, 2012; Zibung and Conzelmann, 2013; Sieghartsleitner et al., 2018). Therefore, this suggests that a developmental pathway should be structured to provide large amounts of football-specific learning activities, but delivered in a broad, diverse, and developmentally appropriate format (Sieghartsleitner et al., 2018), including as examples, coach-led and peer-led practises, peer-led and self-led unstructured free-play, and skill development.\n\nBio-Banding: An Example of a Player Development Intervention\n\nAnother important consideration when selecting/deselecting players before puberty is the large variation in biological maturation among players of the same chronological age. Children of the same chronological age vary substantially in status (state of maturation) and timing (chronological age at which specific maturation events occur) of maturity (Cumming S. P. et al., 2018). Thus, a youth player competing for selection into a talent pathway may be competing against a player who is biologically advantaged by 6 years (Borms, 1986), despite both players being the same chronological age. Given that early maturation brings physical advantages (such as greater physical size, lean muscle mass, speed, power, and strength; Hill et al., 2020), it is unsurprising that a selection (Cumming S. P. et al., 2018), and performance bias (Hill et al., 2020; Parr et al., 2020) exists in favour of early maturing players.\n\nCategorising youth players based upon biological maturity attributes rather than chronological age is an alternative solution through a process termed \u201cbio-banding\u201d (Cumming et al., 2017). Research into bio-banding in English Premier League academy football has been favourably received by stakeholders (Cumming S. et al., 2018; Reeves et al., 2018). Similarly, \u201cplaying up\u201d high potential youth players with chronologically older peers has been suggested to facilitate more appropriate levels of challenge and individual development (Kelly et al., 2020). However, as early biological maturation does not encompass cognitive, emotional, or social development (Cumming S. P. et al., 2018), there is the possibility that categorising players based upon biological maturity alone without considering key psychological developmental influences may be disadvantageous. The influence of biological maturation within youth football is complex and appears to have a greater influence on talent development than the relative age effect (Parr et al., 2020). This is reflected in professional football academy practises, whereby routine monitoring of biological maturity and training load is considered a priority (Salter et al., 2021). More research is needed to conclusively understand performance variations associated with relative age and biological maturity in youth footballers.\n\nThe Dynamic and Non-linear Pathway Experience\n\nIt is also crucial to recognise how changes in broader society and talent pathways influence the developmental activities of young players. Research exploring the developmental histories of elite and non-elite athletes (e.g., Baker et al., 2003; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2005; Gulbin et al., 2010), as well as more anecdotal descriptions of free-play, diversification and development (as evidenced in the development of elite Brazilian footballers; Ford et al., 2012), is purported to offer clues to best practise, generating \u201cevidence-based\u201d practises which can be adopted and applied by sports and organisations in the pursuit of excellence. However, western society has changed, and children are unable to acquire the same amount of outdoor free-play than that of previous generations (Solomon-Moore et al., 2018). This descriptive focus also fails to appreciate that talent development is a biopsychosocial issue and optimum solutions will be contextualised based on the interaction between physical and mechanical attributes (the \u201cbio\u201d), psycho-behavioural characteristics (the \u201cpsycho\u201d), and the sociocultural environment/milieu in which the individual exists (the \u201csocial\u201d) (Collins and MacNamara, 2019). The onus is on sport organisations to critically evaluate the worth and validity of a particular approach (e.g., diversification, specialisation, or early engagement) to provide the most appropriate development experiences in particular contexts. In football, for example, this may be the provision of structures and experiences that allow high potential players to experience sufficient quantities of both football practise, and developmentally appropriate activities and unstructured free play within their developmental pathway. Simply, in sports like football where there is less evidence of the discriminatory power of broader activity (Haugaasen et al., 2014), early selection into an academy setting may not have negative consequences as long as high potential players are provided with an enrichment programme of other activities; a focus on early engagement rather than early specialisation.\n\nThe talent development process is non-linear (Collins and MacNamara, 2012) and the complex transition from youth to professional football (Larsen et al., 2014) could be cited as an argument against early selection. Players should be able to transition in and out of the pathway across multiple time points as they progress, although the reality appears to be more complex, and the number of athletes reaching elite levels is constrained by the numbers of professional players a system can maintain. Simply, deselection from football academies is inevitable for the vast majority of players at some stage, and if poorly managed, it can have negative emotional and psychological impacts on young players (Brown and Potrac, 2009). Athletes have also reported questioning their identity, their ability as an athlete, and the role of sport in their lives following deselection (Neeley et al., 2018; Mitchell et al., 2021). Football clubs have a moral and ethical responsibility to focus on the welfare of all players under their care, whether they are selected to progress further or deselected.\n\nHowever, the pathway experience for deselected young athletes can also be a positive one. Williams and MacNamara (2020) found that high-potential young athletes who were deselected reported that the experience of the talent pathway provided the foundations for future success in other sports, careers, or education opportunities. The talent pathway can provide an environment that develops valuable constructs, (i.e., professionalism and positive performance behaviours), psychobehavioural skills (i.e., social awareness and effective communication), and personal responsibility (i.e., self-motivation and personal drive/desire) which can crossover to alternative domains outside of sport and prove advantageous (Williams and MacNamara, 2020). Similarly, Neeley et al. (2018) identified that deselection from the talent pathway can be accompanied by subsequent personal growth experiences. The authors noted that, despite not progressing, deselected athletes experienced an enhanced sense of personal strength, developed closer social relationships, and recognised new and alternative opportunities. Therefore, it is possible that if structured appropriately, players can have many positive experiences during their time in football academies leading to the development of multiple skills and behaviours that are transferable to many other parts of their lives (Williams and MacNamara, 2020).\n\nIt is unlikely that football clubs will cease to select young players at a young age and in fact, the research suggests that early specialisation issues may be less influential in sports like football which requires higher skill and variability than in athletics, for example (Paul et al., 2016). The focus should be on the quality of the experience offered to high potential young players in order to support their development both on and off the pitch (Strachan et al., 2011; Kelly et al., 2020; Williams and MacNamara, 2020).\n\nDiscussion\n\nDespite the non-linear nature of talent development, there is a lack of research investigating those who do not make it to the highest level, perhaps leading to survivorship bias within the literature (Taylor and Collins, 2019). The need for more research is evident, and issues of biological, neurological, and social readiness have rarely been considered (Baker et al., 2020). We must consider the viewpoints of the coaches, and critically, the high potential young athletes themselves regarding developmental strategies, since their voices have been largely absent from the discussion to date (Baker et al., 2020). When examining the development of young footballers, it is essential to embrace an interdisciplinary approach (rather than a monodisciplinary one) and adopt a longitudinal design (rather than a cross-sectional one) in the hope of better understanding the prospective value of various influences, and how these may gradually oscillate as players age and are exposed to systematic training (Williams et al., 2020).\n\nSelection and deselection are an inevitable part of any pathway and care is needed in both the decision-making process and the language used to describe these decisions. We offer some practical examples.\n\n\u2022 A player's deselection from the highest playing level of the pathway should not be deemed early elimination, but rather as an opportunity for players to be directed to a football environment that is better suited to their needs at that stage of their development. A key aim of the talent development process is to provide players with the best possible environment to support their trajectory and development. Nurturing players along a dynamic pathway in environments best suited to their individual needs at particular points of childhood and adolescence requires a system that facilitates multiple entry, exit and re-entry points. This type of coherent development system may seem aspirational given the socio-political context of modern-day football. Nonetheless, the large gap between research theory and sporting practise that exists (cf. Pankhurst and Collins, 2013) must be addressed and it is the responsibility of those working within the football industry at every level to ensure that the welfare of children is at the forefront of all decision making. If conditions can be created whereby an academy manager feels secure in the knowledge that producing players is not the sole outcome measure, a positive player development model can be woven into academy culture (Mills et al., 2014). From a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach, this may require the refinement of current governance of youth football and increased collaboration and coherence across the youth football landscape. From a \u201cbottom-up\u201d perspective, it points to the importance of quality academy coaching that recognises the complexity and dynamic nature of the developmental process (UK Sport Pathway Coaching Position Statement, 2020).\n\n\u2022 Football clubs and systems should look to provide young players with a variety of playing formats (i.e., modified pitch sizes and futsal), coaching styles (i.e., introduce peer-led free play alongside coach-led practise and competition), and competition structures (i.e., various team sizes and match durations) to provide a football-specific learning experience, but delivered in a broad, diverse, and developmentally appropriate format (Sieghartsleitner et al., 2018).\n\n\u2022 We must consider the socio-political factors within organisational structures that influence player development. A lack of formal communication between youth and professional environments, even within the same club or broader system, can hinder the coherent progression of young players into the professional environment (Relvas et al., 2010). In practical terms, this means that open and clear lines of communication need to exist between clubs and coaches operating at different levels of the game so that players are supported in their development as they progress from youth to adult football.\n\n\u2022 Given that many talented young athletes are derailed from the pathway by a range of psychological influences, it would seem prudent that the academy experience supports the development of the psychological skills and characteristics shown to support development within, and transfer between, sports and domains (MacNamara et al., 2010a,b; Taylor and Collins, 2019). Such practises could be facilitated using the 5C's (commitment, communication, concentration, control and confidence), providing the successful, and crucially, early introduction of interpersonal and psychological skill development into coach, player and peer interactions to facilitate long-term development (cf. Harwood, 2008).\n\n\u2022 Football clubs and broader systems must adopt a holistic approach to player development, whereby players are provided with the tools and resources to develop as people and succeed both in and outside of football (cf. Larsen et al., 2020). Coaches should provide an environment whereby the teaching of life skills (i.e., effective communication, exhibiting leadership, taking the initiative) is emphasised and integrated alongside the teaching of sport-specific skills (Bean et al., 2018). This becomes sustainable once coaches are able and encouraged to discuss and practise life skills and skill transfer with their athletes (Camire and Santos, 2019). Under these circumstances, there is a focus on the overall development of the person, rather than just the footballer.\n\n\u2022 Parents are a key stakeholder in the talent development environment with essential and individualised roles and responsibilities (C\u00f4t\u00e9, 1999; Pankhurst and Collins, 2013). However, many parents of academy players have reported experiencing insufficient levels of communication, feeling undervalued, being treated with a lack of empathy, and feeling worried and uncertain about their child's welfare and future (Harwood et al., 2010; Clarke and Harwood, 2014). To bridge this gap, academy staff must make a conscious effort to spend time developing relationships with parents in order to provide tailored and continuous support in an environment where parents feel welcomed, valued and respected (Newport et al., 2020). Moreover, clubs must make an effort to educate parents early in relation to the necessary motivation-related knowledge and cognitive-behavioural skills to manage themselves and facilitate their child's development throughout their time in the academy (Harwood et al., 2010; Newport et al., 2020). This education may be provided in the form of parent inductions upon entrance into the academy, followed by regular educational workshops and open and transparent discussions between parents, coaches and academy management staff.\n\n\u2022 Professional football clubs must make an effort to collaborate with local grassroots clubs and schools, thereby emphasising vertical coherence within the sport (Webb et al., 2016). This may include opportunities for players from grassroots clubs and schools to train with the academies of professional partner teams, regular school holiday camps hosted at partner club locations, and regular fixtures between professional and grassroots clubs.\n\n\u2022 Finally, the \u201crocky road to the top\u201d (Collins and MacNamara, 2012) must be one that is systematic, well-planned, and coherent. The pathway must enable players' transition in and across challenging environments in a structured and supportive manner (Webb et al., 2016). This nested and nurtured approach to player development, with appropriate, well-planned and periodised developmental challenges and experiences (Collins et al., 2016), only becomes achievable when all of the key stakeholders in the game collaborate for the best interests of players.\n\nData Availability Statement\n\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding author.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.\n\nConflict of Interest\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nReferences\n\nAbbott, A., and Collins, D.

And how does new boss Ange Postecoglou want to reshape the squad?\n\nAnother central midfielder (more on the attacking than defensive side) might make Spurs more dangerous, more consistently, going forward.\n\n[ TRANSFER NEWS: Liverpool | Chelsea | Man City | Arsenal | Man United ]\n\nBelow we roundup the latest done deals, reports and rumors and give our analysis on Tottenham transfer news as Joe Prince-Wright (JPW), Nicholas Mendola (NM) and Andy Edwards (AE) will guide you through a hectic next few months.\n\nTottenham Hotspur rumors transfer news today, live!\n\nJune 6 \u2013 Spurs linked with trio of Premier League backs including Harry Maguire\n\nAnge Postecoglou may be an attack-first manager, but he\u2019s gotta sort out Tottenham\u2019s poor back line.\n\nAnd a report from 90min says Tottenham is considering a trio of Premier League center backs including two from \u2018Big Six\u2019 rivals.\n\nThe juiciest rumor in the mill has to be the idea that Erik ten Hag is open to the idea of selling Harry Maguire to Spurs, who would try to reinvigorate the England center back\u2019s club career after a down 2022-23 season.\n\nBut perhaps more impactful would be the transfer of Aymeric Laporte, once Manchester City\u2019s top center back, to North London.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a more under-the-radar idea in Wolverthampton Wanderers standout Max Kilman, who has emerged as a top defender in his own right despite Wolves\u2019 disappointing season.\n\nThe Kilman investment is a classic Spurs \u201cbuy lower\u201d move, Maguire a wild one, and Laporte the sort of more measured move \u2014 price tag pending \u2014 that would signify something a bit different but also more ambitious. What do you think? (NM)\n\nJune 6 \u2013 Postecoglou hired\n\nTottenham has its man, announcing the hiring of Celtic boss Ange Postecoglou.\n\nJune 5 \u2013 Celtic grant permission for Postecoglou talks\n\nAnge Postecoglou could be Tottenham\u2019s next manager after Celtic granted permission for Spurs to speak with their trophy-collecting boss.\n\nPostecoglou, 57, was born in Greece and moved to Australia at a young age, starring for South Melbourne as a player and earning for caps for the Socceroos.\n\nHe is coming off a domestic treble with Celtic and won five of six trophies available to him in his two seasons with the Bhoys.\n\nPostecoglou won trophies as a manager with South Melbourne, Brisbane Roar, and Yokohama F. Marinos, claiming the Asian Cup during his stint as Australia national team coach. (NM)\n\nJune 3 \u2013 Hugo Lloris ready for a change\n\nIt looks like it\u2019ll be the end of at least one era at Tottenham this summer, as Hugo Lloris gave an interview at home in France stating that he\u2019d like out.\n\nThe Spurs legend has been a staple between the sticks in North London but had a tough season in a number of ways.\n\n\u201cWe are coming to an important moment, whether for the club or for me. It\u2019s the end of an era. I have desires for other things. \u2026 But I don\u2019t forget that I still have a year of contract with Tottenham and that in football it is always difficult to predict what will happen. What is essential at the moment is to recover well from my injury. I\u2019m on vacation but I continue to talk and do my training. My goal is to be on top in July, then we\u2019ll see what the future holds for me.\u201d\n\nLloris made clear in the interview that he\u2019s not looking to retire, and that he\u2019s not ruling out more time at Tottenham.\n\nHe says he has more to give on the pitch.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go from a successful World Cup to being an average player in a few months,\u201d Lloris said. \u201cI had a few hard knocks, I was a little inconsistent in my performance, I got injured twice. I came out of the World Cup pretty dull. The pace had been hellish before that. This is the first time in my career that I am unavailable, but I\u2019m good in my head, in my body. This period will bring me freshness to still make me happy in the effort, the performance, the work. The most important thing is to find a project in which I flourish, at Tottenham among others.\u201d (NM)\n\nApril 9 \u2013 North London derby battle as Spurs, Arsenal scrap for Elye Wahi\n\nTwenty-year-old Montpellier striker Elye Wahi has attracted lots of interest this season with 12 goals and three assists this season.\n\nFrench site Jeunes Footeux says that Arsenal and Tottenham (as well as PSG) have not been put off by that price tag and will look to woo the striker to North London this summer.\n\nWahi\u2019s a young 20, born in January, and he has a contract through the 2024-25 season so he won\u2019t come cheap. The report says Montpellier\u2019s asking for around $35 million.\n\nThe 6-foot center forward had four goals and an assist in his last four games entering Sunday\u2019s visit from Toulouse. The advanced stats say he can carry the ball above average but basically has been strictly a finisher. Sounds like someone could use some schooling from a certain Harry Kane. (NM)\n\nMarch 23 \u2013 Spurs linked with Dean Henderson interest\n\nLook: A Tottenham story that isn\u2019t about Antonio Conte or Harry Kane\u2026 at least entirely.\n\nThat\u2019s because ESPN says that Tottenham\u2019s interest in Manchester United property/serial loanee Dean Henderson could be used to lower the cost for Kane.\n\nHenderson was 14 when he joined Manchester United from Carlisle United in 2011, and he made his senior move in 2015.\n\nHenderson\u2019s on loan to Nottingham Forest, where it\u2019s been no surprise that he shined before going down to injury. Henderson was twice Sheffield United Young Player of the Year, on loan, and won the Championship Golden Glove in boosting the Blades into the Premier League.\n\nClub legend Hugo Lloris has not been himself this season and is currently hurt, Fraser Forster is only under contract through 2023-24, and young keepers Brandon Austin and Alfie Whiteman have limited experience and all on loan. A solution will be needed, and soon. (NM)\n\nFeb. 19 \u2013 Spurs to pursue Antonio Rudiger\n\nIs a London return on the cards for longtime Chelsea man Antonio Rudiger? Maybe, according to Spanish language site Fichajes.\n\nYou\u2019ll remember that the German center back wasn\u2019t exactly angling to leave the Blues but uncertainty over the club\u2019s ownership following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and Roman Abramovich\u2019s links to his country\u2019s president Vladimir Putin led to Rudiger moving to Real Madrid.\n\nThe 29-year-old has been a regular starter at the Bernabeu but the report says continued Real links with new backs including RB Leipzig\u2019s Josko Gvardiol may unsettle Rudiger, who just wants regular playing time and a stable situation.

He\u2019s been playing plenty of center forward and can give Harry Kane a rest, but will also be plenty happy to head to the left wing.\n\nThe Bournemouth winger scored 10 times last season in La Liga and struck six times in 11 UEFA Champions League games, including in knockout round games against Juventus and Bayern Munich.\n\nThe 25-year-old has six goals in 17 matches across all competitions this season for Villarreal. (NM)\n\nJan. 24 \u2013 Danjuma to make late u-turn and join Spurs?\n\nArnaut Danjuma appeared to be heading to Everton from Villarreal but the Dutch winger could now be making a very late u-turn. Danjuma, 25, has been linked with a host of Premier League clubs and looked set to join the Toffees on loan. Despite Frank Lampard being sacked, Danjuma was still expected to sign for Everton but our colleagues in the UK at Sky Sports say he is now heading to Tottenham for talks and a medical has been scheduled for him on Tuesday evening. Danjuma would be a solid squad player for Tottenham and we\u2019ve seen flashes of his brilliance for Bournemouth and also at Villarreal. Antonio Conte wanted to sign some extra cover in attacking areas and it looks like he will get it. (JPW)\n\n#Tottenham have scheduled a medical for Arnaut Danjuma for this evening.

The 29-year-old striker has been heavily linked with a move to both Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Manchester United in the past but a move to the former now seems like it has passed after Erling Haaland\u2019s arrival. Per a report from David Ornstein, Kane and Spurs will talk in early February about a new deal and his priority is to \u2018succeed with Tottenham.\u2019 This is all quite a change from the previous years when it has seemed like Kane was very close to leaving but couldn\u2019t force through an exit as Spurs asked for a huge transfer fee (and rightly so) for their star man. Despite Spurs struggling at the moment as they lose ground in the top four race and the future of Antonio Conte as boss is uncertain, having Kane sign a new contract would at least give Spurs fans some good news as they\u2019ll know Kane will be around to score 20-25 goals a season for at least the next few years. (JPW)\n\n\ud83d\udea8 EXCL: Harry Kane open to signing new contract at Tottenham. No dialogue since summer 2021 but talks planned for after Jan window.

Playing with a focal point like Harry Kane could take him to the next level. (NM)\n\nJan. 9 \u2013 Trossard, Raya linked with Spurs\n\nTottenham have been linked with moves for both Leandro Trossard and David Raya as they try to strengthen their lineup. According to The Telegraph, Brentford and Spain goalkeeper Raya, 27, is seen as the long-term replacement for Hugo Lloris. The French captain only recently signed a contract extension but Lloris, 36, has been linked with a move away from Tottenham in recent years. Per the report, Raya will become Spurs\u2019 top goalkeeping target in the summer and he is a fine shot-stopper and is very good playing the ball out of the back with his feet.\n\nAs for Trossard, this seems like a deal which could happen in January. The Daily Mail claim that Spurs are among several clubs, including Chelsea, who are set to move for the Belgian winger. Trossard, 28, is out of contract at Brighton next summer and didn\u2019t feature in their win at Everton or in their 5-1 FA Cup win at Middlesbrough. It seems like a move this month could be possible as Brighton will aim to recoup some cash for their talented winger/wing-back. Trossard has added goals and assists to his game over the last 12 months and was a key cog in Graham Potter\u2019s success as a hybrid wing-back. However, Roberto De Zerbi could use Kaoru Mitoma in that role and Brighton will look to move on Trossard in January. Spurs need to upgrade their wing-back potions and if Trossard comes in on the left, it would allow Ivan Perisic to play further up the pitch. Alternatively, Trossard is also comfortable playing as a winger or attacking midfielder and he is proven in the Premier League. Is he the type of player who can turn Spurs into a guaranteed top four team? Probably not. Is he a top quality addition who has the potential to slot in seamlessly? He is. (JPW)\n\nDec. 29 \u2013 Tottenham, Manchester United open talks with Rennes for Martin Terrier\n\nYes, Tottenham\u2019s just splashed plenty of cash on a star left winger in Richarlison, but would the versatility of Martin Terrier make him a great fit to compete with the Brazilian as well as Heung-min Son?\n\nFree-scoring Rennes forward Terrier is said to be a target for Tottenham and Manchester United as both clubs reportedly have opened discussions with the Ligue 1 outfit regarding the 25-year-old. Price tag? It reportedly starts around $38 million.\n\nTerrier has scored and assisted on the regular in France\u2019s top flight. He scored 21 goals last season and has eight in 14 matches this season. The left wing can also play center forward amongst other positions. He\u2019s chipped in three goals in the Europa League this campaign and also had provided 11 assists across all competitions since the start of last season.\n\nVery strong in the air and plenty good in combination play, Terrier has posted impressed xG and xA numbers and could combine with Kane but also deputize for the exhaustively-used CF. He may be a better fit for Spurs but might Man United before more willing to spend to get him?

Per the report, Spurs are willing to pay up to $41 million for the Texas native. McKennie, 23, was signed for Juventus by their former sporting director Fabio Paratici, who is now in the same role at Spurs. Antonio Conte wants to strengthen his midfield options and McKennie would be a near-perfect fit in midfield in Conte\u2019s aggressive, mobile 4-3-3 system. His versatility is also stated as a big factor for Conte.\n\nBut there\u2019s a twist. There\u2019s always a twist. With superstar Paul Pogba arriving back at Juventus this summer and expected to eat up plenty of the minutes McKennie was previously getting, Pogba has just gone down with a knee injury in preseason. That requires surgery and it means Juve may not move on McKennie this summer after all. Another twist? McKennie is yet to feature on Juventus\u2019 preseason tour of the United States of America as he was unused substitute in each of their games against Barcelona and Chivas Guadalajara. During the tour Juve boss Max Allegri has stated that McKennie is working his way back to full fitness, so maybe there\u2019s nothing to read into here, but it is a little odd that Juventus haven\u2019t given any minutes to one of the best USMNT players on their U.S. tour, right? Perhaps they aren\u2019t risking him being injured as a transfer away is imminent? McKennie seems fairly happy at Juventus but it seems inevitable he will end up in the Premier League at some point.

Spence excelled while he was on loan at Nottingham Forest last season and it is believed he\u2019s signed for Spurs for an initial $15 million fee and add ons could take the deal to $24 million. Spence is regarded as one of the top young right back prospects in England and he will push Emerson Royal and Matt Doherty all the way for a starting spot. Spence is exactly the kind of right wing-back Conte loves in his 3-4-3 system and his attacking instincts will slot in really well at Spurs.

The 27-year-old is said to have stayed Thursday night in Tottenham\u2019s on-site hotel at the club\u2019s training facility.\n\nWhile Ben Davies was certainly a (surprising) standout performer as the left-sided center back in Conte\u2019s back-three down the stretch last season, Lenglet represents an upgrade in quality and his arrival instantly creates depth at a vitally important (and dangerous thin) position in Tottenham\u2019s squad.

Bissouma, a Mali international, had one year left on his contract at Brighton and that drove his transfer fee down. He\u2019s worth at least double what Spurs paid for him and the combative central midfielder is just the type of destroyer who will thrive in Antonio Conte\u2019s system.\n\n\ud83c\udf99 \u201cI'm very happy to be here\u201d Watch Bissouma\u2019s first interview as a Spurs player! \ud83d\udc4a \u2014 Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) June 17, 2022\n\nOf course, he\u2019s smooth on the ball and has plenty of poise to his game too, but Bissouma\u2019s arrival adds more steel to Tottenham\u2019s team and more depth too as Ivan Perisic and Fraser Forster have already arrived this summer. Daniel Levy and Fabio Paratici are certainly delivering the additions Conte wanted. This is a very savvy addition by Spurs. With Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Rodrigo Bentancur the first-choice pairing in central midfield and Oliver Skipp around too, Conte now has four top quality options for his two central midfield spots. That will help a lot with rotating the lineup from Champions League games in midweek to PL action at he weekend.

His track record of taking groups to the NBA Finals and his reputation for being able to get the most out of his players make him a highly sought-after manager. He beats the highest assistant NBA coaches' salaries.\n\n9. Rick Carlisle\n\nCarlisle has an annual salary of $7.25 million.

This high salary reflects his success as a player and manager and his ability to lead teams successfully.\n\nHis focus on player development characterises Kidd's coaching style, and he is known for his ability to help players improve their skills and reach their full potential. He has a reputation for being a player-friendly manager who empowers his players to take ownership of their roles on the team.\n\n7. Steve Nash\n\nToday, Steve Nash is the manager of the Brooklyn Nets and is one of the highest-paid coaches in the NBA, earning a salary of $8 million per year.

Mike Budenholzer\n\nMike Budenholzer is currently the head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, earning a salary of $8 million per year.

He is known for his ability to develop young players and get the most out of his roster, as evidenced by the Bucks' championship run in 2021. However, his reputation has been marred by criticism that he needs to work on making suitable adjustments during the playoffs.\n\n4. Erik Spoelstra\n\nUnder Spoelstra's leadership, the Heat won two NBA championships in 2012 and 2013, and he was named NBA Coach of the Year once in 2012. He is also known for his exceptional game preparation, in-game adjustments, and ability to build strong relationships with his players.\n\nHead coach Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat reacts against the Philadelphia 76ers at Wells Fargo Center on February 27, 2023, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

He is known for his ability to lead his teams to success, as evidenced by his numerous accolades, including Coach of the Year in 2000 and an NBA championship with the Boston Celtics in 2008.\n\nDespite his success, Rivers has faced criticism for his inability to win in the playoffs in recent years. His tenure with the Los Angeles Clippers ended after several disappointing postseason performances, which left some questioning his coaching abilities. However, Rivers has continued to prove himself as a skilled coach, leading the 76ers to a top spot in the Eastern Conference standings in the 2020-2021 season.\n\n2. Steve Kerr\n\nKerr was also recognised as NBA Coach of the Year twice, in 2015 and 2016.

His contributions to the sport of basketball and beyond have solidified his place as one of the most respected and influential figures in the NBA.\n\n1.

But if you put time into developing young players correctly, there\u2019s a lot to be gained from it.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ve broken down the key information about how to develop young players in Football Manager 2023 into five key headings.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThere is little point in focusing on youth development in Football Manager 2023 if your club isn\u2019t set up for it. To see the state of your club facilities, go to the \u2018Club info\u2019 page and click the \u2018Facilities\u2019 tab. Look at your training facilities, youth facilities, youth level, junior coaching and youth recruitment.\n\nOften, these will all be in a similar state to each other. However, if one is lagging behind the others, then it\u2019s worth asking your board to address this going forward. If they are all equally underperforming, then you\u2019ll need a lot of boardroom support and the finances necessary to bring them up to par. The facilities don\u2019t have to be perfect, just suitable for your needs.\n\nIf you are lacking in regards to junior coaching and youth recruitment, you still can develop young players but your youth intake is likely to be poor. Youth facilities are obviously vital.\n\nStaff\n\nInvesting in relevant staff is important in developing young players in Football Manager 2023. There is no point having a decent selection of youngsters with no one to train them. You can find the youth team staff at the bottom of the \u2018Staff\u2019 page. Alternatively, you can go to the Development Centre and click on \u2018Staff\u2019. Use staff searches to get the best available.\n\nYou can ignore youth staff if you are not using youth squads and instead developing a small handful of young talent that trains with the first team. This may be the best option if you lack some facilities as well.\n\nDevelopment Centre\n\nThe development centre, accessible by the right of the home page, shows you everything you need to know about your younger players. The overview will give you the summary of your younger players and how they\u2019re progressing. You can look at the individual youth team and their potential and see recommendations from staff.\n\nYou can also see how those out on loan are faring and if the loan move has been good for them and their playing ability.\n\nTraining\n\nYou can choose to go as in depth as you like when you develop young players in Football Manager 2023. By going to \u2018Development\u2019 in a player\u2019s profile, you will see what training the player is doing and if they have any particular focuses outside of the usual.\n\nYounger players are more adaptable to developing new positions and they\u2019ll show a better result to specific routines. There is no \u201cbest\u201d type of player and you can choose to develop them however you choose. If you aren\u2019t sure, then focusing on a specific role reinforces their ability to carry it out.\n\nBy default the youth teams will train to the same tactic you use. You are able to change that if you want to, even controlling the role an individual trains in. If you believe that a player would be better suited if they trained a certain way, then you\u2019re free to change it. While young players are adaptable, some are more than others. Look at the player\u2019s report if you aren\u2019t sure.\n\nThe staff page has a section on responsibilities, and on there you can choose how much you delegate to staff and how much micromanagement you want to do. If you are micromanaging you will still need good staff to enact your ideas.\n\nLoans and Playing Time\n\nYoung players will only develop so much in a youth system and will need real game time to fully mature. It is hard to judge when to enact this, but by 18 they should be at least considering game time.\n\nIf you can, getting the player to play first team football at your club is ideal. You get the benefit of giving them the necessary playing time but you can still dictate their training. However, many players will not get to that level without first playing in a lower league. This is where loans come in.\n\nLoaning players is only good for players that get the game time they deserve. They will also benefit more if they are being played and trained in their chosen position; you can ensure this by locking this in their loan offer.\n\nClub happiness and how well the club is doing is also a factor in development. Take these into consideration when sending a player out on loan.\n\nUltimately, developing young players in Football Manager 2023 is about having good staff, good facilities and game time. You can choose how they develop and positions they play, but without good staff and facilities they won\u2019t get far.\n\nClick here for more Football Manager 2023 guides"}, {"url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-6526567/Star-Cricket-Academy-helping-develop-young-stars-game-including-Englands-Ollie-Pope.html", "page_content": "This winter saw a rare triumph for England cricketers in Asian conditions with the 3-0 Test series win against Sri Lanka heralded as massive step forward.\n\nJoe Root's men were rightly feted for the result by those who know just how hard it is for fast bowlers to overcome benign pitches and batsmen to plunder runs against devilish spin in dry conditions.\n\nBut how do English batsman learn how to cope with conditions in countries such as India?\n\nFor one cricket academy the answer is to send them to the sub-continent when they are still young.\n\nStar Cricket Academy, founded by former Indian professional batsman Sid Lahiri, has developed some exciting new stars of the game including England's Ollie Pope.\n\nOllie Pope made his England debut against India in August at the age of just 20 - he is one of a number of exciting young stars that the Star Cricket Academy in Surrey has worked with\n\nPope receives his England cap from Surrey legend Alec Stewart, who praised the youngster\n\nEngland prospect Ryan Patel, left and right in helmet, with Star Cricket Academy's Sid Lahriri\n\nPope, 20, made three centuries in his first ten first class matches playing for Surrey in the County Championship before playing twice for England in last summer's series against India.\n\nAlec Stewart, former England star and Surrey\u2019s director of cricket, said: 'Ollie is a 360 batsman - he can play anywhere around the ground with regulation and reverse shots. He\u2019s an exciting talent.'\n\nStar Cricket Academy in India - players include Alex Milton (back row, fourth from left), Amar Virdi (back row, sixth from left) and Ryan Patel (seated in chair, far right)\n\nAnother tour group from Star Cricket Academy enjoy a trip to India\n\nA recent image of promising young cricketers as they get to grips with Indian conditions\n\nAll-rounder Ryan Patel, 21, a former England under-19 international, took six wickets for just five runs in 11 balls for Surrey in a County Championship game against Somerset.\n\nWicket-keeper Alex Milton, 22, has recently been signed by Worcestershire on a two-year contract, opening batsman Phil Salt, 22, is now playing for Sussex and Amar Virdi, 19, is a Surrey first-team player and England Under-19 international.\n\nStarted in Cobham, Surrey, in 2005 by opening batsman Lahiri, who played Premier League cricket in India, the academy has developed a reputation for nurturing the talents of some of the brightest new stars of the Test and county game.\n\nCoach Lahiri shows a stroke at the Jarrett Indoor Cricket Centre at Reed's School in Cobham\n\nYoung batsmen listen as ECB Level 3 coach Lahiri instructs them in the finer points of batting\n\nStar Academy director Lahiri, an ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) Level 3 coach, said: 'In 2003, I was playing professional cricket in India but came to England to do my ECB level one and two courses and I planned to go back.\n\n'But I was persuaded to do my level three and I ended up moving to the Cobham area.\n\n'I became head of cricket at Parkside School in Cobham and then I opened the academy in 2005, and it\u2019s just grown and grown.\n\n'I am so proud of the young stars who have trained at the academy and are now making their mark in the county and international game.\n\n'It was an unbelievable moment when Ollie Pope made his England debut in the summer against India.\n\n'I had Ollie from the age of eight to 14 and he would be training with me and the rest of the team every day.\n\n'His game is not that different now from his time at Star Academy - he has a wonderful, simple technique and a brilliant attitude.\n\n'Ollie, Alex Milton, Ryan Patel, Phil Salt and Amar Virdi have all done brilliantly. They are all brave, have worked incredibly hard and have the mental tenacity to make it in the professional game.\n\nA young player in the nets outdoors at the academy in Surrey\n\n'We have boys and girls coming from all over Surrey and often from all over the south of England, and that\u2019s every evening and all weekend.'\n\nSo what is the secret of their success? Lahiri said:'It is just quality coaching and the big thing that I think we have got is we watch how players do something and then we know how to get that right.\n\n'We also have a good rapport with the children and the parents. It\u2019s a good atmosphere with a lot of laughter, so people look forward to coming.'\n\nLahiri hopes to open more academies in future. 'We have a model here which works, from the coaches to the children, and we like to think we are giving something back to the local community as well and we could open a few more like this - that would be great.'\n\nWorking alongside Lahiri at Star Cricket Academy are senior coaches South African Tom Tremewan, who has worked for Surrey County Cricket Club, leg spin bowler Matt Packham, who has been coached by Shane Warne, Derek Agge, a West Indian who has played with Brian Lara, and Jamie Mann, who plays first XI cricket for Walton-on-Thames CC in the Surrey Championship.\n\nVery young children also see the benefit of top-level coaching\n\nAll four are experienced ECB Level 2 coaches. Young star Ryan Patel said: 'Having known Sid from such a young age, he has come to know my game and character extremely well. Sid is able to see and pick up the smallest of technical issues and put them right.\n\n'Sid has become more than just a cricket coach to me, and I\u2019m thankful to him and his academy for playing a part and being on the journey with me along my cricket career.'\n\nLast summer, the academy moved from Parkside School to Reed's School in Cobham where former England and Surrey cricketer Keith Medlycott is head of cricket. The academy also has close connections with Surrey County Cricket Club, director of cricket Alec Stewart, and its academy director Gareth Townsend.\n\nLahiri, right, shows a stroke next to a bowling machine. He has played professionally in India\n\nAs well as sessions at the academy, rising star Ryan Patel has also been part of coaching groups that Lahiri has taken to cricket camps in his native India at the Institute of Sports (IOS) in Nagpur, Maharashtra, and he believes the experience he gained on those trips was \u2018invaluable.\u2019\n\nPatel said: 'I have had the opportunity to visit the cricket camp in India on three occasions with Sid, which was invaluable and a great experience.\n\n'Having from a young young age wanted to be a professional cricketer, Sid has always been encouraging, someone to talk to, and just as determined as I to achieve my goal.'\n\nLahiri said: 'I would like to thank Zubin Bharucha and Romi Bhinder, the directors of IOS, for providing an outstanding opportunity for the boys and girls of UK to train at their facility in India. I am proud to be one to the lead coaches of IOS. The opportunity to train outdoors in the winter months on turf against quality bowlers is icing on the cake for all the boys from UK.\n\n'Phil Salt visited our India camps three successive times and I coached him in India, building on the excellent work Keith has done with Phil at Reed's.'\n\nLahiri is excited to be coaching more girls at the academy. He said: 'Lots of emphasis is put now on girls' coaching - something we have lacked in the past.\n\n'I am personally coaching Ella Clinton, a 13-year-old who is doing really well and I think has a promising future. We now have 12 girls in our coaching classes.\n\n'Although it\u2019s a lot less in comparison to nearly 300 boys which we coach, it\u2019s a work in progress and we are keen to encourage and help lots of girls to play and enjoy cricket.'\n\nLahiri said the future looks bright with some outstanding new prospects. He said: 'Lots of new talent is coming through between the ages of 9-14 including Krish Patel, Cameron Ellis, Oscar Jones, Yusuf Afzal, Charlie Ashton, Krish Anand, Ahmed Khan, Luke Webster, Tom Pitts and Chirag Das Ghose to name a few.'\n\nAnd Lahiri is looking forward to an exciting 2019.\n\nHe said: 'We have been a big part of the early years of many of these stars of the future, laying the foundations for their future careers.\n\n'We are thrilled to have moved to Reed's and to be working with a fantastic former England cricketer in Keith who has been to our training camps in India along with Gareth Townsend.\n\n'We have a very exciting future ahead of us.'"}, {"url": "https://simplifaster.com/articles/youth-club-soccer-player-development/", "page_content": "Does your youth sports club preach player development and follow through with its promises? Or does your club toss \u201cplayer development\u201d around as an alluring phrase to hypnotize parents into joining your organization?\n\nIf there is anything you should get from this article, it is to take player development seriously and uphold it meticulously, as well as take radical action to ensure your players develop in a well-rounded fashion.\n\n\u201cPlayer development\u201d is a buzzworthy slogan in the youth sports world that is widely broadcasted, yet rarely executed. Clubs that practice player development year-round and for the life of a child athlete\u2019s career are few and far between.\n\nWhat Is Player Development?\n\nLet me first dive into what player development is not: It\u2019s not about coaches and clubs.\n\nRather, player development focuses on the young human first and the construction of the complete player\u2014one who is physically, technically, and tactically sound. Adding on to that, it is also one who is mentally resilient and prepared for the oscillations of life.\n\nFrom the physical side of player development, are your athletes strong, powerful, fast, agile, and conditioned to withstand the demands of the game and a year-round schedule that is more rigorous than that of the pros?\n\nTechnically speaking, are your athletes sharp with sport-specific movements, especially under pressure and applied in a game situation? This could be a basketball player dribbling their way out of a double team, or a soccer player beating a defender one-versus-one, or a baseball pitcher throwing three strikes. Do you reinforce these skills weekly, and do you hold players accountable to practice on their own?\n\nIn the tactical corner, can they move off the ball, anticipate the next play, understand the role of their position, and think creatively without coaching cues from the sideline?\n\nAnd looking to the mental side, are they able to pull themselves out of hardship, tackle adversity with poise, use nerves as fuel to perform at a high level, and be forgiving of themselves for their mistakes?\n\nThe physical, technical, tactical, and mental pieces perform an integrated dance when true player development is the focus of clubs.\n\nIf you are a coach who preaches an attacking formation, how do you expect players to run at top speeds off the ball and make lightning diagonal runs? They need the physical piece, too.\n\nIf you are a coach who preaches perfect passes without opposition, how do you expect players to pass and move under pressure? They need the tactical piece, too.\n\nIf you are a coach who preaches risk-taking with technical skills, how do you expect players to be confident in their approach if you berate them for their mistakes at training sessions? They need the mental piece, too.\n\nIf you are a coach who preaches sharp combination play, how do you expect players to be skilled on the ball if you don\u2019t reinforce skill mastery at your training sessions? They need the technical piece, too.\n\nTo that end, it all matters.\n\nCoaches do their players a tremendous disservice when they fail to fill the player development buckets of physical, technical, tactical, and mental equally.\n\nI understand that the noise of wins and rankings gets in the way, but we all need to remind ourselves daily why we coach: to help youth athletes become their best selves on and off the field.\n\nExpounding further, this goes beyond sports and extends far into the long term: a college player lasts for a finite moment in time, but a human lasts longer\u2014a human who can accept failure with ease, a human who can thrive in the competitive workforce, a human who can lean into creativity to grow something magical, a human who takes care of their health after sport ends.\n\nHere are 10 things clubs should do to practice player development.\n\nRefer out to Experts\n\nThis much I know: It takes an army to develop a player. A team coach, technical coach, and strength coach are just a few of the experts involved in the player development process\u2014no one person can do it all. Sure, referring out to another niche expert might be a harsh reminder that you do not know it all, but don\u2019t let it be a hit to your ego.\n\nAs an example, a coach referring out to a strength and conditioning professional to improve their team\u2019s speed mechanics and ability to handle eccentric load is a step in the right direction. I have seen a few clubs do this, and these are the clubs that are respected for providing their players with not only value, but great care. Another initiative I have seen recently that guides players with the mental piece is a club reaching out to a sport psychologist to give a presentation on performance anxiety, and how to deal with failure.\n\nEven if you do not make money or profit by recommending the strength coach, physical therapist, or sport psychologist down the street, you provide a tremendous service to your young player. Parents take notice too. When clubs and coaches invest in resources and realize it is valuable for the long run, even though they may cringe at the cost, everyone benefits. Most importantly, the young players blossom.\n\nHave a Holistic-Purpose Sport Technology\n\nSport technology can be useful if applied properly, but it can be detrimental if it\u2019s only invested in for the sake of having cool offerings to splash on social media. Clubs that have genuine intentions with sport technology examine the data first before looking at the likes on Instagram.\n\nYou need advanced technology for optimal player development. It can tell you valuable information about managing fatigue and adjusting training sessions, so your players perform at capacity. However, technology is useless if it is only used to take a photo of a leg sensor on a 10-year-old for Instagram, rather than having the coaching staff apply it. It is tantamount to buying a luxurious car without having a mechanic to maintain it and keep it functioning.\n\nThe same goes for youth sport technology: invest in it with the purpose of applying the data to tweak your pitch and gym sessions that training week, not for the sake of showing parents your club has more products than the club next door.\n\nDon\u2019t Focus on Wins and Rankings\n\nTake it from a woman who recruits for college, wins and rankings matter far less these days. Of course, back when colleges traveled to showcases more and attended the top tournaments in the country, kids had to be on a team with a high ranking. But now?\n\nMore college programs operate under the ID camp model, where players travel to them, pay a fee, and get evaluated for 1\u20133 days. More college coaches are moving into this model because they do not want to fork out the travel expenses, they can stay at their home base, and the talent comes to them with checks in hand.\n\nWhile a fraction of college coaches still go to top tournaments, it does not hurt to be on a winning team. However, it is no longer everything, nor is it a make-or-break factor.\n\nCan these kids go to an ID camp and leave a remarkable impression upon the coaches? Do these kids know the game? Do these kids present all buckets of the total player\u2014physical, technical, tactical, and mental? Moreover, can they apply their skills? Are they physically fit to handle the demands of competition and outrun other potential recruits? Are they mentally tough to prove themselves in a single day on campus?\n\nIf clubs focus on player development, players will show themselves well at ID camps. Is that not the end goal here?\n\nEncourage Other Sports and Physical Activities\n\nThere are a plethora of coaches out there who remember that kids are kids, and they are meant to be exposed to a variety of movement, sports, and physical activities. This is not just from a physical development standpoint, either. These coaches realize that a variety of activities is good for a kid\u2019s mental and social health, too.\n\nA study from the American Journal of Sports Medicine shows that kids involved in multiple sports who participated in more games still experienced fewer injuries. Of course, I could list an archive of studies on the topic, but we all know the research is not new.\n\nWe also cannot forget that load monitoring plays a pivotal role here if a kid chooses to play one sport. Yet, most clubs don\u2019t do the strength and conditioning piece, so how do we expect these kids to handle the chronic loads and recover effectively? The caveat is if kids opt to do a single sport, does the coach truly encourage fatigue monitoring? Do they incorporate strength, balance, spatial awareness, and other basic motor skills into their sessions?\n\nVideo 1 (here). Crawling is not just for elementary school kids, but for all athletes. The decision of how much and when is up to the coach, and that will vary based on needs.\n\nIt is a tough, yet fair question to ask, and it takes a little creativity and preparation from the coach\u2019s end. Kids need a diverse palette of movement to build neural connections in their brain and enhance motor skills, so let us provide them with that.\n\nGive Equal Playing Time\n\nClubs that give equal playing time to child athletes practice all of the components of player development all at once. Game play is the best way for kids to explore their sport beyond rehearsed practice sessions. When kids are on the field playing the sport they love or in the gym exploring movement, they are learning how to problem-solve, move, sprint, make mistakes, apply their skills, and more.\n\n\n\nVideo 2. Pull-ups are great for developing strength but don\u2019t forget general monkey bar training. Having athletes complete straight sets is part of the training process and adding general climbing or pulling motions is essential for a complete athlete.\n\nGoing beyond learning the game through playing time, can you imagine what this does for a player mentally? Can you see them beaming with confidence? Can you seem them smiling when they are out there with their teammates? Can you seem them shining with joy when they score a goal?\n\nThe coaches who realize that the local U10 tournament championship is trivial compared to the happiness of the kids are the ones doing player development right. The coaches who expose young ones to a lot of minutes, positions, and scenarios are the ones looking out for the longevity of their players.\n\nMoreover, it pains me to see 8-, 9-, and 10-year-olds sitting on the bench discouraged, disoriented, and confused as the rest of their teammates are out there playing. What is worse is that these kids develop a nasty taste in their mouth for the game and wonder if they will ever be good enough.\n\nSure, the \u201cbetter\u201d kids\u2019 parents might get mad that their 8-year-old\u2019s team is not winning games, but I promise a college scholarship will not suffer because of this. Player development is a long-term process, and setting kids up for successearly by exposing them to the game as much as possible ensures they soak in an understanding of the game.\n\nClubs that provide equal playing time at the young ages understand it is paramount for kids to develop physically, technically, tactically, and mentally through equal playing time.\n\nGuide Players Through College Recruiting\n\nFollowing through on promises of college recruiting preparation is another way clubs practice player development. After all, most of these players and parents have the end goal of a college scholarship and evolving into an even better player after high school is over. This is the social piece of player development that clubs often overlook, and it\u2019s the most critical.\n\nAs a college recruiter myself, it is easy to tell which athletes went into the process prepared and educated by their coaches. These are the players who reached out to us early, drafted an edited and professional email, and stayed in touched with us for feedback relentlessly. Sadly, most young athletes are not even taught how to draft an email, yet clubs promise college recruiting pathways for their players.\n\nThe clubs that walk the walk with college prep value their players\u2019 long-term dreams to play at a high level.\n\nIncrease Players\u2019 Strengths\n\nThe best coaches see the genius in their players and amplify their talents to bring them out during competition.\n\nReminding kids of their strengths consistently\u2014what they bring to the collective group, their role on the team, and their talents\u2014has a way of boosting confidence and hyping kids up. While it is important to work on weaknesses and instruct players on what they can improve, it is another thing to berate them, tell them they\u2019re terrible, and not provide them with guidance on how to improve.\n\nNot every kid will be the aggressive one. Not every kid will be the fast one. Not every kid will be the play-maker. Not every kid will have it all. But what coaches can do is hammer home to their players what their strengths are so they can further grow and nurture them.\n\nMake Injury Prevention a Priority\n\nThe health of the players affects whether or not they can continue to develop, and clubs that blend in the physical piece of player development make injury prevention a priority. They execute dynamic warm-ups before training sessions and games, consistently reinforce strength and mobility work, and make it mandatory to stretch and recover after games.\n\nThe standard for injury prevention training is set by the coach, who creates a culture that requires doing the small things to stay healthy for the long haul.\n\nIt can be something as simple as motivating kids to buy an in-house pull-up bar:\n\nVideo 3 (here). Assisted pull-ups allow anyone to train at home. Having a pull-up bar at home reminds athletes and even coaches that training doesn\u2019t need to be away from home to be effective.\n\nRequiring players to keep a foam roller, mini band, and nutritious snack in their bag during tournaments also goes a long way.\n\nSomething as efficient as performing an on-field strength session that attacks all muscle groups of the body so kids continue to get stronger is also a good idea:\n\nVideo 4 (here). On the field, core work is easy and adding a ball to the equation enhances the training. Any athlete can benefit from this partner-assisted exercise.\n\nYou can also program maximal sprints with a long recovery to ensure kids are reaching top speeds during practices:\n\n\n\nVideo 5. Group speed training can be done with short races. You don\u2019t need to sprint one at a time to get improvement in player speed; you just have to have a good plan ready for adjusting to what you see.\n\nThese are easy actions that the best clubs take to physically develop their players, and they need to be mandatory.\n\nFoster a Safe and Inspiring Environment\n\nIt warms my heart to see coaches welcome their young players at every practice session with excitement, exuberance, and passion. Making kids feel important, loved, and valued the moment they show up to the field instills trust, and provides them with an escape from the stressors of daily life. Even it is something as small as putting a bow in your hair to match your young athletes during their sessions, it means the world to them that you are relatable and welcoming.\n\nVideo 6 (here). Lower level drills and games are fun for everyone, not just the athletes. Incorporate participation when you feel it enhances the learning process.\n\nTo that end, infuse practices with goofiness, laughter, smiles, and high-fives. The mental side of player development begins with providing your players with great care and putting them in an environment where they feel safe, pumped up to play, and welcomed.\n\nI cannot for the life of me understand a coach who is emotionally abusive, makes kids cry, and yells and points in their faces. This is so incredibly far from player development because it ignores the most critical piece: the mental.\n\nBuilding players up, giving them a sense of community, and ensuring they are comfortable the moment they arrive is key.\n\nPromote Free Play and Creative Thinking\n\nSeeing coaches get out of the way is refreshing because it allows kids to play, be autonomous, and enjoy the sport for what it is. Not only can they learn to be independent thinkers, they can tap into the creative corners of their brains to better flow along with the spontaneous nature of the game.\n\nStopping play every 10 seconds to bark out a coaching cue that goes in one ear and out the other can prove to do more harm than good for young ones, especially after they have been told what to do all day in school and by their parents.\n\nClub-wide free play nights are an excellent way to ensure kids run around uncoached and give them a break from the structured, rehearsed tactical drills. However, there needs to be more free play encouraged besides clubs having just a set night. This can start with the coach speaking to their players about weekly pick-up games in the neighborhood, educating the parents about why something like this is critical, or telling kids to create their own drill, skill pattern, or game each week.\n\nAs an example, my players came up with this awesome game of 1v1 dodgeball:\n\nVideo 7 (here). One-on-one or 1 v 1 doesn\u2019t need to be actual soccer. Global athletic development is about competition and athleticism, not only sport-specific skills.\n\nThere were no instructions, rules, or limitations given. They were given a bag of dodgeballs and were free to create any game they desired. The result? They had a blast.\n\nI understand that it is tough to bite your tongue and keep from sounding important and acting as the authority. I also understand it is hard to put the practice plan away and give kids your power. However, for the sake of developing their brains into magicians rather than robots, it is worth you just watching and staying quiet.\n\nEvery behavioral change from parents and players starts at the top\u2014with clubs and coaches not only setting the expectation and sticking to it, but simply educating weekly and reinforcing the importance of creative play.\n\nMake Player Development Your Standard\n\nPlayer development is beautiful, but it will come with costs, which means wins might suffer, parents might criticize, and money might be lost. But if player development is what clubs preach\u2014and value\u2014they will make it happen. I have seen few walk the walk, so let us be grateful for those who do not use player development as a sexy catchphrase, but rather, as a standard practice.\n\nSince you\u2019re here\u2026\n\n\u2026we have a small favor to ask.

Aaron Winter looks to have intercepted the ball, but Gascoigne\u2019s elbows propel him past the would-be tackler and into a one-v-one with Danny Blind. While everyone is watching the ball, Teddy Sheringham quickly scans the field of play. He has spotted something. Gascoigne flicks a pass into Sheringham\u2019s feet as he breaches the 18-yard box. The Tottenham forward opens his body up, pulling his right foot back as he prepares to unleash a first-time finish.\n\nBut he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a ruse and everyone falls for it. Johan de Kock loses his footing. The Netherlands goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar is out of position. Rather than shoot, Sheringham cushions a pass into the path of his strike partner Alan Shearer who lashes the ball home to make it 3-0. England go on to win the game 4-1 and advance to the quarter-finals of Euro 96.\n\nMost players in Sheringham\u2019s position would have walloped the ball at goal or taken a touch; few would have had the nous to calculate all the variables in a split second, before fooling everyone with a perfectly disguised pass. His ability to read the game enabled him to outsmart opponents with superior athletic gifts.\n\nAs a teenager Sheringham was told he was too slow to reach the highest level of the game. But the boy from east London showed his detractors that a lack of pace could be overcome by intelligence. He evaded defenders across a 32-year playing career and won three Premier League titles, an FA Cup and a Champions League. \u201cPeople had doubted me through my career, even from saying I wasn\u2019t quick enough for Millwall\u2019s youth team,\u201d said Sheringham, who retired at 42 with 51 caps. \u201cBut I\u2019d been given something in life: a football intelligence.\u201d\n\nAlan Shearer bangs in England\u2019s third goal against the Netherlands at Euor 96 thanks to a smart assist from Teddy Sheringham. Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images\n\nAsked about football intelligence, most fans would cite Sheringham, along with the likes of Paul Scholes, Andrea Pirlo and Xavi \u2013 players who seemed able to pause the game to take in a 360-degree camera angle of the action. But defining the attribute is complicated. Unlike traditional athletic powers, intelligence has no measurable metric. The football brain is frequently referenced by the fans and pundits, but what is it? How does football IQ manifest itself on the pitch? How does the brain coordinate the superhuman actions of a top-level player? And does an elite footballer\u2019s brain have superior powers to that of an amateur turning out on a Sunday morning?\n\nBefore poking around a footballer\u2019s brain and 55\u201370 billion neurons powering 90 minutes of pass and move, we need to know what in-game intelligence looks like through the lens of those at the top level. \u201cOoofff,\u201d laughs the former Tottenham and Norwich City striker Paul McVeigh. \u201cThat\u2019s very difficult to explain.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt\u2019s about the quality of decision-making and the thousands upon thousands of decisions a player has to make during a match every second. The better their understanding of the game, the better their decision-making.\u201d\n\nAn elite footballer performs 150\u2013250 intense actions during a game, according to a study in the Journal of Sports Sciences. For every one of those actions, there\u2019s a mass of information to digest \u2013 visual cues, instructions from the coach, calculating force and angles, spatial awareness of a wide area \u2013 all of which a player has to process in real time to make a quick, potentially game-changing decision. On top of that, they have to (in normal circumstances) cope with the emotion teeming from the stands.\n\nTo make sense of this swirling chaos you need to master four disciplines, according to QPR\u2019s technical director Chris Ramsey. \u201cFirst thing is awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a striker, what is your awareness of the person on the ball? You\u2019re asking yourself, \u2018Has he got time? Is he going to cross it? What\u2019s his body language?\u2019 Once you\u2019ve ascertained what they\u2019re going to do, what\u2019s your movement? How will you lose the defender? When you see the cross coming in, it\u2019s about your timing \u2013 do you go slow or do you go quick? And then, finally, execution: how are you going to finish? What part of the foot do you kick with it? Are you going to bring it down? Can you head it?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s enough to scramble your brain, which is why it requires a higher-functioning mind to decode it. Those that can, scan. This is fundamental to on-pitch awareness. Rather than lose valuable seconds assessing their options once they\u2019re in possession, smart players keep looking over their shoulders as they take mental pictures of their teammates, opponents and the boundaries of the pitch in relation to themselves.\n\n\u201cTeddy didn\u2019t need pace,\u201d the former Arsenal striker Ian Wright said. \u201cHe was five yards quicker upstairs. He already knew what was happening before the ball came to him. Dennis Bergkamp was the same. He\u2019d already had a look before receiving the ball. He never wasted a pass, especially when he got into the last third. He\u2019d pass the ball to me in a situation where it negated the defender.\u201d\n\nDennis Bergkamp in action for Arsenal in 1995. Photograph: David Jacobs/Action Images\n\nWright\u2019s observations of the traits displayed by his playmaking teammates align with data collected in 2013. Researchers studied video images of 118 players (midfielders and forwards) from 1,279 game situations in the Premier League and found \u201cthe best players explore more frequently\u201d with \u201ca clear positive relationship between visual exploratory behaviours that are initiated before receiving the ball and performance with the ball.\u201d\n\nScanning enables a player to create a 3D map of what\u2019s around them and then supplement that with what\u2019s been rehearsed in training, the tactical plan and knowledge of the opponent. No player has the capacity to make sense of all this information at once, so the brain hands over to the subconscious, which hits the button on decision-making. \u201cScanning is not conscious, it\u2019s a primary process,\u201d said Dr John Sullivan, a sports scientist and clinical sport psychologist who has worked with a number of Premier League clubs. \u201cEvery millisecond, players are scanning approximately nine bits of essential information \u2013 it\u2019s called \u2018multiple object tracking\u2019 and they\u2019re taking snapshots for the brain to simulate what might happen.\n\n\u201cThe visual system at the back of the brain \u2013 the occipital lobe \u2013 takes in the information and feeds it to the amygdala and limbic system \u2013 our emotional centres. Then we decide without conscious thought, \u2018Do I pass the ball, or do I hold because the picture has changed, and it now feels unsafe?\u2019 A decision is made based on patterns before the brain communicates with our motor cortex to move the ball. While the game is chaotic, there are only a certain number of patterns to recognise, so players develop a memory capacity for the game, its patterns and movements.\u201d\n\nHowever, some things haven\u2019t been rehearsed. They happen in a flash and require specialised hardware. For instance, Jorginho\u2019s assist for Tammy Abraham during Chelsea\u2019s 2-1 win over Watford in November 2019. The Italy international hit an improbable bending pass behind the opposition\u2019s defence for the England striker to dink the ball over Ben Foster. Elite players don\u2019t have a third eye, but the two they have are exceptional.\n\nResearchers from Liverpool John Moores University compared the visual capabilities of 49 Premier League players, 31 intermediate footballers and 230 healthy men and women who are not professional athletes. The footballers, both pro and intermediate, had significantly better vision than the non-athletes, scoring better on tests for visual clarity (ability to see detail at a distance), contrast sensitivity (ability to detect an object against a background) and near-far quickness (ability to change eye gaze and attention between near and far distances).\n\nThis explains how Jorginho saw that defence-shredding pass. First he scans, using his powers for multiple object tracking, to inform pass selection. Then his visual clarity and contrast sensitivity help spot Abraham 25 yards away, beyond a cluster of players and against a backdrop of fans. Near-far speed enables him to switch his attention between Mason Mount, from whom he receives a pass, and Abraham.\n\nAs this goal demonstrates, no beautiful pass can be complete without the clever movement of a teammate. In this instance, Abraham takes a step away from Watford\u2019s goal to put the defenders on the back foot and create space for him to run into. Then his cerebellum \u2013 the part of the brain that controls balance and coordinated movement \u2013 kicks in, reading Jorginho\u2019s body movement and using that to predict the trajectory of the pass.\n\nWhile Christian Kabasele and Craig Dawson are caught on their heels, Abraham is already into his stride, timing his run to perfection. Abraham is blessed with considerable athleticism \u2013 speed, size, power and strength \u2013 while at the other end of the centre-forward scale, you\u2019ll find the likes of Thomas M\u00fcller and Filippo Inzaghi, players with more standout flaws than remarkable gifts.\n\nFilippo Inzaghi celebrates after scoring in the Champions League final in 2005. Photograph: Stefano Rellandini/Reuters\n\nYet, their unique talent for being \u201cin the right place at the right time\u201d enabled them to score hundreds of goals. \u201cPlayers with excellent movement have a high processing speed which coincides with their elite emotional management abilities. They\u2019re able to take in more information and understand what it means,\u201d explained Sullivan, co-author of The Brain Always Wins. \u201cWhen information-processing needs increase, that can overwhelm some players, but if they\u2019re able to stay calm and manage their energy, they can make smarter decisions in a matter of milliseconds.\n\n\u201cThis process is a very fast coordination effort of the lower and upper centres of the brain. They are accessing a database of simulations stored in their brain and the more emotional and cognitive resources that are available, the more accurate and quicker the decisions.\u201d\n\nDuring all the hours of training and playing, elite athletes observe the actions of those around them, activating the brain\u2019s mirror neurons. These brain cells store that information for use later on, either to incorporate that learning into their own game \u2013 a skill, for instance \u2013 or to predict what their opponent is going to do next.\n\nImagine being a defender trying to keep your eye on the ball, while maintaining your position and tracking a striker who has the advantage of knowing where their teammate intends to direct his cross. It\u2019s a nightmare. This is why the best defenders, especially those who can\u2019t bail themselves out with pace, are able to sniff out danger. They develop a sixth sense for it.\n\n\u201cMy strengths were psychological rather than physical or technical,\u201d said McVeigh, author of The Stupid Footballer is Dead: Insights into the Mind of a Professional Footballer. \u201cI always tried to outsmart defenders, but when I came up against John Terry it was like a four-year-old trying to beat up Tyson Fury. Because he was a world-class defender his expertise was far greater than mine \u2013 it\u2019s like he\u2019d already seen all my best moves. He should have just patted me on the head and told me to be on my way.\u201d\n\nThere are a number of mechanisms at work in the brain that enable players like Terry to see into the future, as Dr Chuck Leonard of the University of Montana\u2019s Motor Control Laboratory explains. \u201cAnxiety and danger involve the amygdala \u2013 a tiny, almond-shaped structure thought to be part of the basal ganglia and therefore responsible for movement characteristics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPlanning ahead and realising consequences of your actions and inference lie in the frontal lobe. Amygdala and frontal lobes communicate mainly via the cingulate cortex \u2013 an area of the brain intimately connected to memory and emotion. We know there are neurons in the brain referred to as mirror neurons that allow us to recognise faces and the emotions behind facial expressions. Also, obviously involved would be the visual cortex. There are neurons there that specifically respond to movement \u2013 size, colour, speed, angle of trajectory and acceleration.\u201d\n\nJohn Terry in action for Chelsea against Spurs. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian\n\nBy studying brain scans, Brunel University researchers discovered highly skilled footballers are able to activate more areas of their brain than novices when they see an opponent heading towards them, making them better able to anticipate their moves. The research, published in the Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology, found that experienced players seem to have developed a \u201cchecking\u201d system that suppresses the urge to react instinctively, making them less likely to fall for deceptive feints.\n\nIn short, top players watch one another and pick up little clues that others can\u2019t see, while amateurs just watch the ball. \u201cWe know if you watch the ball too much, you\u2019re not a high-level processor,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cThe ball is a cue, but the motion of players is what you need to be tuning into.\u201d\n\nThe field of play has been scanned, the movement made and the pass released. Now the ball is in flight and it\u2019s all about timing and execution. In March 2000 at Valley Parade, Bradford City are hosting Manchester United. David Beckham takes a corner, striking a flat cross to the edge of the box where Scholes is prowling unattended. The midfielder carefully tracks the trajectory of the ball, timing his take-off to perfection so that he leaves the ground at just the right moment to connect with the cross. A sweetly struck first-time volley flies into the bottom left corner of the net.\n\nScholes is so chuffed he\u2019s almost laughing in disbelief as he runs over to Beckham to celebrate. Reflecting on the goal, the scorer makes it sound so simple. \u201cWe never worked on it in training,\u201d he said. \u201cBecks just took the corner, I gave him a little look to let him know I was there, he delivered it to where I wanted and I volleyed it in. We were on the same wavelength.\u201d\n\nFamiliarity forged on the training ground explains the ingenuity behind the goal, but it doesn\u2019t explain the precision of Scholes\u2019 punctuality. Elite players lock their inbuilt targeting system onto the ball like a military-grade weapon. \u201cTracking an object requires the person to first move their head and eyes to the target, which always results in a slight overshoot, then quickly flick the eyes back to foveate on the target [get the target centred on the optic nerve],\u201d says Dr Leonard. \u201cElite players move their heads quicker, more accurately and for a slightly greater distance. All of this provides greater accuracy in hitting a target.\u201d\n\nReacting to stimuli during a game requires awareness, anticipation, quick thinking and vision \u2013 qualities which operate on a subconscious level. Hours of training and high-level matches have encoded a player\u2019s cognitive system with the software to handle the demands of a professional game. Tactics, however, occupy another tier of football intelligence. On top of processing the chaos, players have to execute the manager\u2019s instructions. \u201cFootball intelligence is about being mentally versatile to roles and responsibilities quickly,\u201d said Ramsey. \u201cSomeone who moves from team to team and fits in no problem understands the nuances of different systems.\u201d\n\nDespite being essentially a one-club man, no player exemplifies this adaptability better than Philipp Lahm. Pep Guardiola, who managed Lahm at Bayern Munich between 2013 and 2016, said, \u201cHe is one of the most fantastic players I ever trained in my life and one of the most intelligent. He can play in ten positions, no problems because he understands the game perfectly.\u201d\n\nTo help implement his new style of play, characterised by fluidity and fluency, Guardiola moved Lahm from right-back into central midfield, where he became one of the best in the world. Arjen Robben and Franck Rib\u00e9ry were Guardiola\u2019s most dangerous attacking players so the Spaniard funnelled play into the centre of pitch where players like Lahm would win the ball back and distribute with precision and speed to the wingers who were now in space.\n\nLahm was 29 when Guardiola came to Munich and by this point he had optimised his motor skills \u2013 running, passing, dribbling \u2013 which allowed the brain\u2019s cortex to switch off during a game, handing over to the subcortical circuitry which is much faster. This freed up bandwidth for the World Cup winner to digest Guardiola\u2019s coaching points. This process is known as executive function.\n\nPhilipp Lahm and Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich. Photograph: Matthias Schr\u00e4der/AP\n\nA study at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden found that the brains of top footballers can work quickly \u201cwith information\u201d and make \u201cdecisions about the environment\u201d. Researchers recruited players from Swedish football\u2019s professional leagues and non-players to assess their \u201cproblem-solving, planning \u2013 multitasking, cognitive-flexibility and ability to deal with novelty\u201d.\n\nPros in the top tier registered the highest scores, followed by players from a lower division and then non-players. The performance of the elite players was impressive \u2013 they ranked in the top two per cent when compared with the general population. For the following two seasons researchers monitored some of the players and found a correlation between test scores and performance \u2013 those with higher test scores had more goals and assists.\n\nThe neuroscientists also took the test to Barcelona, where the brains of Xavi and Andr\u00e9s Iniesta were available for examination. The latter ranked in the top 0.1% for design fluency (ability to generate geometric patterns) and also scored highly in the category of inhibition (the ability to modify your instinctive reaction to a situation in order to complete a task). Xavi\u2019s performance was equally impressive, with the four-time Champions League winner scoring highly for scanning ability, analysis and imagination.\n\nPlayers require more than a high-speed processor to make smart choices on the pitch. Emotions, the very impulses players are often advised to suppress, are in reality instrumental in their decision-making. Self-control is preached across the game and therefore succumbing to an outburst is seen as a sign of weakness. There\u2019s logic behind this ethos, yet the best players don\u2019t just control their emotions, they channel them.\n\nMichael Thomas doesn\u2019t score that dramatic winner at Anfield without the resilience to overcome a miss earlier in the game. Lionel Messi wouldn\u2019t be able to repeatedly crush the opposition if he couldn\u2019t control his temper under a barrage of kicks and elbows. Jack Grealish doesn\u2019t score the winner in the Birmingham derby if he\u2019s not able to control his emotions after getting whacked by a pitch-invading fan. Pirlo doesn\u2019t panenka Joe Hart during the Euro 2012 penalty shootout between Italy and England without unshakable belief. In the absence of emotional intelligence, technique and athleticism are rendered useless.\n\nMichael Thomas scoring at Anfield to give Arsenal the league title. Photograph: Colorsport/REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cIf athletes can\u2019t manage their emotions in the moment, it doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re capable of physically or cognitively \u2013 emotions run the show,\u201d said Sullivan. \u201cThe process is: see, feel, do, or inhibit action. The way we normally refer to this process is rarely the way it actually works. For example, we see an opening and then our emotions determine whether the option can be successful. Through these successes and errors, we learn the game and the emotional feedback loop and, thus, this becomes the way we know and understand how to operate. Our brain is an emotional system and learning does not happen without emotions. Thus, depending on the speed of hesitation during the game and self-doubt, initial emotional processes can be crippling if we cannot read the game at speed and feel it through. Top athletes develop the total package \u2013 physical, emotional and cognitive abilities.\u201d\n\nClubs across the globe are scouring the earth in search of the next cerebral maestro. Recruitment departments have all the data they could want on physical performance but how do you measure prospects from the neck up? That\u2019s where the people like Tottenham\u2019s talent-spotter Dave Bricknell comes in. He doesn\u2019t have a special piece of equipment that measures football IQ; he just looks out for specific behaviours that point towards an innate understanding of the game.\n\n\u201cFrom an early age you\u2019re looking to see if a kid has spatial awareness,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could be a kid who can dribble around lots of players or a kid who drops into space, gets the ball and looks for a pass. Then as you go up the age groups, you\u2019re assessing their positioning \u2013 do they know when to hold or when to go forward? The closer you get to the first team, the more you\u2019re looking for tactical appreciation. Can they take on instructions and adapt during a game? That\u2019s a different kind of intelligence to playing on instinct. Instinct will only get you so far. Then there are players like Harry Kane who have the intelligence to work hard and improve.\u201d\n\nBricknell was the manager for Ridgeway Rovers when a six-year-old Kane joined the club and immediately stood out for his vision and emotional intelligence. \u201cHe could see a pass, he could play,\u201d said Bricknell. \u201cBut Harry\u2019s best attribute was his great self-belief. He would score lots of goals, but if it went wide and he didn\u2019t score, he wouldn\u2019t worry about it \u2013 he\u2019d just go and get his next chance and try to score again.\u201d\n\nKane\u2019s remarkable rise from fringe player at Spurs to one of the best strikers in the world is well documented, with his dedication and resilience dragging him to the top. Strikers claim goalscorers are born not bred. But Kane started as a goalkeeper. So, where did he acquire the coordination, timing and awareness to score more than 200 career goals by the age of 26? Are they natural gifts or have these weapons been honed on the training ground?\n\n\u201cThere is no natural,\u201d said Ramsey, who helped develop Kane during his time at the club, first as head of player development and then as a first-team coach under Tim Sherwood. \u201cBabies aren\u2019t born as footballers, they need coaching and experience to become an intelligent player. There are great players on Hackney Marshes, but they haven\u2019t been exposed to the level of coaching they need to understand the game. Football intelligence is a product of coaching and experience and how you adapt to it. If you haven\u2019t been exposed to either, you won\u2019t develop an IQ for the game.\u201d\n\nHarry Kane in action for Spurs in the Europa League in 2014. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters\n\nCoaches such as Michel Bruyninckx want to shift the focus away from the physical and on to the psychological. The Belgian has created a curriculum focused on \u201cbrain-centred learning\u201d for a group of talented youngsters aged 12-19 selected by the national football federation. He asks his players to complete maths games during conditioning workouts and play in bare feet to make them more \u201csensorially\u201d aware.\n\n\u201cWe need to stop thinking football is only a matter of the body,\u201d he said. \u201cSkilfulness will only grow if we better understand the mental part of developing a player. Cognitive readiness, improved perception, better mastering of time and space in combination with perfect motor functioning.\u201d Anyone questioning his methods need only look at esteemed names among his alumni \u2013 Napoli forward Dries Mertens and Royal Antwerp midfielder Steven Defour are the standout graduates. \u201cHe has given me that crucial extra metre in my head that is so important,\u201d said Mertens.\n\nBy working with young players, Bruyninckx aims to take advantage of an optimal time for learning, strengthening the connections between brain and body. Hardwiring the pathway of communication between a thought and an action \u2013 i.e. scanning before receiving the ball in a congested midfield to speed up pass selection \u2013 will make a player more efficient. They won\u2019t have to think, it will just happen.\n\nThere is data to support this theory. Japanese researchers scanned Neymar\u2019s brain activity while he rotated his right ankle. They also scanned three other professional footballers, two top swimmers and one amateur footballer, all of whom performed the same task. The size and intensity of brain activity was smaller in the four professional footballers than in the three other participants, and Neymar\u2019s activity was smallest of all. Essentially, the movement has become so ingrained in the Brazilian\u2019s brain he doesn\u2019t even have to use it.\n\nTechnology companies are trying to devise training equipment that creates shortcuts to this high-level instinctive play. Borussia Dortmund and Hoffenheim use the Footbonaut \u2013 a training device that fires balls into players from eight different machines. The number of balls, speed and spin can be altered using a tablet, testing a player\u2019s reaction speed and technique.\n\nElsewhere, Southampton are using a Virtual Reality training system, Be Your Best, which features a database of 700 interactive scenarios. Players slip on a VR headset to immerse themselves in one of these situations and once three seconds have passed they must assess their options before selecting the correct pass with a hand controller. Whether it\u2019s technological advancements or unique coaching methods, everything is designed to upgrade a player\u2019s intellectual software, to turn a chaotic game into a predictable set of outcomes.\n\nContrary to popular belief, football intelligence isn\u2019t about thinking, it\u2019s about bypassing the thought process and going straight to the action. \u201cIn sport, if you over-think, you\u2019re done. You see it, you feel it, and then you do it. When we are most effective, we\u2019re generally not consciously processing actions. In the game, there\u2019s really no time to think,\u201d said Sullivan.\n\nThe idea that you\u2019re born with an innate understanding of the game is misguided. Yes, natural talent is a factor and some individuals are blessed with genetic advantages, but what really talent gives you is an access code to knowledge. It plugs you into a network of high-level coaching.\n\nWhen Cristiano Ronaldo arrived at Manchester United in 2003 he was a petulant young winger obsessed with tricks. His style of play was the very antithesis of football intelligence. After six years with Alex Ferguson and a dressing room full of world-class players, he developed into an efficient machine that reserved his energy for explosive, result-defining moments. Years of training rewires the brains of elite footballers so they have answers to a 90-minute multiple-choice exam. Perhaps it\u2019s best to let football\u2019s greatest thinker, Johan Cruyff, have the final word. \u201cYou play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2849418-nbas-young-role-players-who-can-still-become-stars", "page_content": "1 of 6\n\nJohn Leyba/Associated Press\n\nJamal Murray, Denver Nuggets\n\nAfter averaging 18.2 points and 4.8 assists per game for the 54-win Nuggets last season, Murray still has plenty of room to improve his 47.6 two-point percentage and 36.7 percent three-point mark. The 22-year-old will have three more full seasons before he potentially enters his prime.\n\nHe will also earn valuable playoff experience in those seasons, assuming Denver's roster and health remain intact. With Murray, it seems like more of a question of when he'll crack an All-Star team than if he'll get there.\n\nPascal Siakam, Toronto Raptors\n\nSiakam, 25, had a case for All-Star consideration last season before he helped the Raptors win a title. He averaged 19.8 points on 50.5 percent shooting in the Finals, and that was despite missing 16 of 21 threes. His shooting numbers have improved in each of his three seasons in Toronto, and yet it still seems like he has room to go from one made three per game to two.\n\nWith Kawhi Leonard gone, Siakam's usage could skyrocket from last year's 20.8 percent. He's a great bet to make his first All-Star team in 2019-20.\n\nJohn Collins, Atlanta Hawks\n\nCollins' production will become more appreciated when the Hawks inevitably win more games. His new floor looks like the 19.5 points and 9.8 rebounds per game he put up last season.\n\nAs Trae Young continues to develop and shooters Cam Reddish, Kevin Huerter and De'Andre Hunter build confidence, Collins could have an elite setup passer, space to operate and plenty of touches.\n\nHe also took a notable step forward around the perimeter, having made 0.9 threes per game at a 34.8 percent clip. Those numbers seem bound to rise for the 21-year-old budding star.\n\nLauri Markkanen, Chicago Bulls\n\nMarkkanen hasn't received the same recognition as fellow 2017 lottery standouts Fox, Tatum and Mitchell. He could be on a similar path, however, after he averaged 18.7 points during a sophomore year cut short by health issues.\n\nHis shooting has carried over from Arizona, resulting in at least 2.1 made threes per game in each season in Chicago. For a 7-footer, his success using the dribble and converting inside the arc has hinted at All-Star scoring potential. Markkanen, 22, has also been a good enough rebounder and defender to avoid questions about his overall two-way value.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon, Indiana Pacers\n\nThe only player since Stephen Curry in 2015-16 (minimum 50 games) to shoot at least 50 percent, 40 percent from three and 90 percent from the free-throw line, Brogdon reached elite role-player status last year in Milwaukee. He's now in Indiana without a league MVP in the lineup and Victor Oladipo coming off a ruptured quad.\n\nOne of the NBA's most efficient starters, the 26-year-old Brogdon should have the chance to raise his production in a higher-usage role. Helping the Pacers and Oladipo return to a top seed in the East could elevate Brogdon's image to that of a star."}, {"url": "https://footballmanagerstory.com/how-to-develop-youth-in-fm-2014/", "page_content": "Hey guys and welcome to this guide on how to develop youth in FM 2014.

Having seen some of the players he developed like Adam Campbell (who I seriously recommend you look at on the Scouting Network) I think I myself will be learning a thing or two from Wayne\u2019s practices. Over to Wayne\u2026\n\nHow To Develop Youth In FM 2014 \u2013 Intro\n\nHey all, my name is Wayne and I\u2019ve been an avid player of FM ever since i was introduced to the game by a friend in 2011 and I\u2019ve found this site immensely helpful in finding the best wonderkids for the game. Since I\u2019ve been asked to write up a simple guide on how to develop youth in FM 2014 I\u2019m giving it a shot.\n\nFrom my experience with the game, the key pointers to follow when developing youngsters are of course finding the correct wonderkids, game-time, coaching, growth and patience. However, do note that you may face some difficulties in ticking all the boxes depending on the club and league you are managing in. I feel that I usually achieve maximum growth with youngsters when starting out in the championship as they are able to start more games without affecting results too much. Ideally, I would like to start in League One but attracting wonderkids to championship clubs while fending off interest from larger clubs is already a feat in itself, and most 4-5 star coaches usually shun lower tier clubs until they achieve a higher status.\n\nOn the flip side, managing mid-high tier clubs such as Newcastle and Tottenham allows you to land wonderkids and coaches fairly easily, but in the premiership playing your best players is the only way to guarantee the best results. The only way to overcome this would be to choose an elite team, where the quality of the players should allow you to constantly accommodate a few youngsters and attract the best coaches, but then again, where\u2019s the fun in that, right?\n\nHow To Develop Youth In FM 2014 \u2013 Getting The Right Wonderkids\n\nJust refer to the huge list of players on the Scouting Network! As I like to start with Championship clubs, I just go for the cheapest available and roll from there. If you want to start from the Championship, it is always better to sell your ageing players that are still worth good money to fund your influx of new blood. Do not worry as the championship is quite easy to navigate even when using wonderkids. Just make sure not to end up in a situation where players in key positions are unfilled because you sold that last defender to fund the purchase of your fifth young striker (I tend to face this problem all too often).\n\nHow To Develop Youth In FM 2014 \u2013 Game Time\n\nOne advantage when managing in the Championship is that the league consists of more clubs (at least for England), and this means more experience for your fledglings. Do try to let your wonderkid play in as many games as possible, preferably first team football, but substitute appearances work too. An important point to note here is that youngsters tire more easily, and be sure to give them a break if they start getting jaded as their stats might actually decrease.\n\nIf you ply your trade in the Premiership or other first tier leagues where results matter more, it might be harder to spare games for your wonderkids and this is where friendly matches come into play. During the pre season be sure to arrange as many friendlies as possible as it not only helps your youngsters progress, it also lets the team regain their fitness for the upcoming season. Some may think U21 leagues are good enough but human management is always the best (this applies to pre-season friendlies as well. The AI does a bad job with arranging matches in my opinion so you might want to take things into your own hands).\n\nLastly, while loaning players out to get game time might be a good idea, be sure that your youngster is at least a first team regular at the other club and that he is used in the preferred position. Thankfully, FM14 comes with a feature to let you know if the other managers are doing your player more harm than good. Note that players can only be recalled during a transfer window and you have to (and should in most loan circumstances) insert a recall clause in the loanee\u2019s contract.\n\nHow To Develop Youth In FM 2014 \u2013 Coaching\n\nAs most of you should know by now, the higher the star rating for coaches the better. In a nutshell, simply assign the coach with he highest star rating for the specific category. The main issue with coaching that I would like to address is the fact that lower tier clubs have limited resources (specifically low staff wages and numbers) and most top class coaches shun these clubs. When managing a new club for the first time, the first thing you should do is take a look at the club structure. Never settle for the initial coaches, sometimes including your assistant manager as they tend to be (mostly) junk.\n\nFor some reason, many clubs have an excess of physios, fitness coaches and U21 coaches. All these excess numbers take up valuable resources that could be better allocated. Always aim for a minimum of a 3 star rating in every category (although I sometimes make do with 2.5). After letting your excess staff leave on mutual terminations, try to recruit a decent backroom of your own. It takes some trial and error on your part, but there are a few excellent coaches that are willing to join lower teams on minimal wage, such as Marcel Lucassen (ball ctrl), Chico Fraga (attacking) and Paul Winsper (fitness.) Some of these coaches are good enough to coach in 2 or more categories while maintaining a 2.5-3 star rating. Do play around with the assignments a bit for the best results. Your ultimate goal is to have a 4-5 star rating across the board, which should be easily achieved upon promotion.\n\nLastly, it is worth your while to scroll through your players\u2019 training status every few weeks. Players will mostly be pleased/happy or content with their training, however if one or two players are unhappy with their training schedule, then reduce their workload to average or light as it affects their rate of growth. If the unhappiness is still there a few weeks after you have lightened their workload it means they have a negative approach towards training and it might be time to warn the player through a private chat.\n\nHow To Develop Youth In FM 2014 \u2013 Tutoring\n\nAnother aspect of coaching that is overlooked by many is player tutoring. A general rule of thumb is that the better the personality and the higher the determination of the youngster, the faster he will progress. A tutee will always take on his tutor\u2019s personality, some preferred moves and have an increase determination if the tutor\u2019s determination is higher than the tutee when you choose the \u2018improve his game\u2019 option, and the tutee likes the tutor. Good traits to take on are model professional, determined etc. However, determination is always more important. If you choose off pitch development the tutee will only experience an increase in determination. Note that the tutor\u2019s squad status must match or be higher than the tutee for the tutoring option to appear. Hence, if you have resources to spare it may be beneficial to sign those ageing players with insane mental stats on a short term contract to tutor your youngsters. NEVER allow a player with lower determination to coach a tutee with higher determination as the tutee will experience a drastic drop in determination (made this mistake once and had to release the tutor on a free transfer to stop the tutoring).\n\nHow To Develop Youth In FM 2014 \u2013 Player Growth/Patience\n\nSo, you have given him 45 games per season, hired the best coaches, gotten Messi to tutor him, and the kid you paid \u00a325 million for shows no signs of improvement. Do not fret, at least not yet. Besides determination and personality, potential ability is another key factor. It should be noted that no two games of FM are ever alike. Every wonderkid, bar some well established ones, has a different potential ability that determines how far he can go in the game. The same player that has ripped apart defences in your previous save may reach his limit as an average Joe in your next one.\n\nThat aside, some players simply develop slower than others and while they may not show potential early on, there might just be a world beater waiting to emerge the following season. It might be as late as 21-23 years old before they show signs of progression so be patient and rely on your scouts for advice. Finally, if the player is going through a long stretch with no marked improvement, you might want to try reprimanding him via private chat. If the player reacts positively then all is well, however if he reacts negatively, you might have to deal with an unhappy player in the squad for some time."}, {"url": "https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/praise", "page_content": "praise\n\nThus, partial tolerance becomes the perfect alibi for generalized prejudice against the regional varieties and praise of the standard.
