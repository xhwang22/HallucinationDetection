She studied at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan and at the Goodman School of Drama (now the Theatre School of DePaul University) in Chicago, where she focused on directing, fearing that her unusual physique (she had hypopituitary dwarfism and was not conventionally pretty) would limit her acting opportunities. She then moved to New York City, where she directed and stage-managed at small community theatres before joining the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut. Hunt made her professional debut in the theatre\u2019s 1972 production of Hamlet, playing Lucianus. She first appeared on Broadway in 1975, playing Norah in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s Ah, Wilderness!, and she also performed in the Long Wharf production of The Rose Tattoo in 1977.

Hunt\u2019s portrayal of the complex and contradictory character, who serves as the dramatic centre of the film, earned her an Academy Award (making her the first person to win an Oscar for playing a character of the opposite sex). She performed in two Off-Broadway productions in 1983, playing Joan of Arc in Little Victories and Pope Joan in Top Girls. She won praise for her performance in the title role of a 1984 staging by the Boston Shakespeare Company of Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Mother Courage and Her Children, and she was nominated for a Tony Award for her leading role in the 1984 Broadway production of Arthur Kopit\u2019s End of the World.

While some stars only have to show their talent to make a career in Hollywood, Linda\u2019s efforts had to be much bigger, so everyone would accept her just the way she was. She had to learn how to deal with despair and disappointment, but the fact that she never settled for less helped her become the star she is today.\n\nWe at Bright Side love to watch Hunt in movies, and finding out about her journey made us love her even more.\n\nLinda\u2019s childhood was difficult, but thanks to her parent\u2019s encouragement, she managed to rise above every obstacle.\n\nWhen Hunt was only 6 months old, her parents noticed that something about her was different. Her motor development was slow, and when her mother took her to the hospital, they said that Linda had a form of congenital hypothyroidism, and eventually she would have to be institutionalized.\n\nInstead of accepting this prognosis, Linda\u2019s mother decided to beat the odds and began working with her every day on strengthening her motor skills. Hunt improved dramatically by the time she started school, but she was still different from her peers and didn\u2019t fit in. Even from the first day of school, she experienced isolation and estrangement, and one of her teachers made her feel uncomfortable. \u201cEverybody either wanted to take care of me or push me around, you know?\u201d she said, \u201cI was teased a lot.\u201d\n\nLinda feared that her condition would limit her acting opportunities.\n\n\u201cI knew I wanted to act at an early age. I didn\u2019t realize how difficult it was going to be,\u201d Hunt revealed for a newspaper in 1991. It all started when she was 8 years old, when she saw a stage performance of Peter Pan in the theater. She realized she wanted to do that too \u2014 to have the power to make others believe what was in her mind. And when she revealed her interest to her parents, they hired voice and acting coaches, and then sent her to the Goodman School of Drama in Chicago.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s when her doctor discovered that she, in fact, didn\u2019t have congenital hypothyroidism but hypopituitary dwarfism \u2014 a condition where the pituitary gland doesn\u2019t release enough growth hormone. She was 4\u20199\u2033 and weighed only 80 pounds, and for 10 years, she tried various treatments and medications to improve her condition, but unfortunately, they didn\u2019t work.\n\n\n\nDuring her studies, her professors encouraged her to pursue directing instead of acting because they felt that, due to her condition, as an actress, she would have a hard time making a living.\n\nAfter graduating in her early 20s, Hunt moved to New York to start a career.\n\n\u201cI was very young and very lost. I didn\u2019t even attempt to act professionally. That would\u2019ve meant getting an agent and going on auditions. I wasn\u2019t capable of doing any of that. It was truly emotionally beyond me,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\n\nThankfully, Linda had a bunch of friends who helped and gave her moral support. She found a job as a stage manager for small theaters off-Broadway. But, even after 3 years of working, she hadn\u2019t managed to leave a mark and started to doubt herself.\n\n\n\nShe then moved back to her parents\u2019 house, and that\u2019s when everything changed.\n\nLinda decided to go back to doing what she loves \u2014 ACTING.\n\nEast News\n\nWhile she was staying with her parents, her acting coach reminded Linda about the importance of acting in her life and the fact that that\u2019s her talent. \u201cI had lost myself for a while, and that awareness gave me back to myself.\u201d Soon she started reading for parts and sending out resumes.\n\n\n\nShe made her professional debut in Hamlet and in the following 2 years, she appeared in several more plays. Then one day, Linda received a call from her agent, saying that director Peter Weir was looking for someone to play the role of Billy Kwan (a half-Asian male photographer with dwarfism) in the movie The Year of Living Dangerously.\n\nMGM/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News\n\n\u201cI met the casting director and said, \u2019You are going to rewrite the male part for a woman, right?\u2019 And he said, \u2019No.\u2019 I laughed. It was so wonderfully preposterous,\u201d Linda recalled.\n\n\n\nBut after she met with Peter, she realized she had to take the part. \u201cIt was one of those absurd moments in life when you have to go forward into a situation that makes no sense.\u201d Even though it might\u2019ve looked like nonsense to her at the time, this role helped her talent fulfill its full potential, and she became the first person to win an Oscar for playing a character of the opposite sex.\n\nBut, even after winning an Academy Award, Linda\u2019s life didn\u2019t change, and it didn\u2019t propel her to the top as much as she wanted.\n\nHunt managed to land several title roles in theater, but in films, she had to settle for supporting roles only. \u201cI am working more than I thought I\u2019d be. I am not working as much as I\u2019d like. I am still feeling enough frustrations about my life and my career that I am in analysis now \u2014 but not forever. I go into moments of total despair and darkness. Thankfully, I believe there are always answers,\u201d she revealed in a candid interview.\n\n\n\nEven though, back then, her career didn\u2019t skyrocket as she expected, today she is one of the most recognizable characters in Hollywood. Throughout her career, she appeared in movies such as Dune, Kindergarten Cop, Dragonfly, and more. She also had a successful career in voice-over work and television, notably being the TV series NCIS: Los Angeles, for which she has received 2 Teen Choice Awards. After all, Linda Hunt proved that with a positive attitude, hard work, and dedication everything is possible."}, {"url": "https://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/linda-hunt/credits/3000103612/", "page_content": "Join or Sign In\n\nSign in to customize your TV listings\n\nContinue with Facebook\n\nContinue with email\n\nBy joining TV Guide, you agree to our Terms of Use and acknowledge the data practices in our Privacy Policy."}, {"url": "https://www.thelist.com/654844/the-real-reason-linda-hunt-had-to-miss-time-on-ncis/", "page_content": "The Real Reason Linda Hunt Had To Miss Time On NCIS\n\nLinda Hunt of \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" is memorable, quirky, and incredible at what she does.

She has appeared in a variety of productions, films, and television shows, sharing the spotlight with her brilliant co-stars and sharing her talent with the world. Her filmography is impressive and shows off her stunning range as a performer, lending her voice to animated films and shows as well as showing just how far she can push herself in most serious roles, too.\n\nBorn on April 2, 1945, in Morristown, New Jersey, Hunt was raised in Westport, Connecticut. She is one of two children to her parents and grew up enjoying the arts and participating in them. Taking a leap of faith, Hunt went forward with pursuing her passion for acting, and it\u2019s safe to say that all of her hard work and dedication has truly paid off.\n\nWhile Hunt has appeared in many productions throughout her lifetime, one of her most notable and recognizable roles was as Hetty Lange on the television show \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles.\u201d She appeared on the show for 12 seasons and even made a guest appearance later on. Fans grew to not only love the character but also love Hunt as an actress.\n\nShe has gone on to be nominated and win several awards throughout the course of her career, earning her recognition amongst critics and fans alike. Hunt has also shared some insights into both her personal and professional life, including her actual height and what her family is really like. Read on to find out more about this accomplished actress\u2019 life story.\n\nMaking Her Mark\n\nLinda Hunt (2015), (Araya Doheny/WireImage/Getty images)\n\nGrowing up in Connecticut, Hunt was a big fan of the arts. Her father, Raymond, was the vice president of Harper Fuel Oil, while her mother, Elsie, was a piano teacher. They were very encouraging of their daughter\u2019s ambitions.\n\nHunt became completely mesmerized by the idea of becoming an actress after seeing a stage performance of \u201cPeter Pan\u201d during her childhood, according to Britannica. She was so determined to make her dreams come true that she began pursuing her passion by implementing it into her studies and attended the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan as well as the Goodman School of Drama in Chicago.\n\nShe focused heavily on directing since it seemed like her physical frame was limiting her opportunities as an actress. According to Britannica, Hunt had hypopituitary dwarfism and was not conventionally beautiful, and her appearance was something that sadly held her back. Hunt has a short height, standing at 4 feet 9 inches tall.\n\nHunt, fortunately, made her dreams a reality and began appearing in stage productions and Broadway shows during the 1970s. In 1982, Hunt made her mark on the entertainment industry by portraying a male character named Billy Kawn in \u201cThe Year of Living Dangerously,\u201d earning plenty of praise and recognition for the complex and dramatic role.\n\nThe role even earned her her first Academy Award, making her the first person to win an Oscar for playing a character of the opposite sex, according to Britannica. She has also gone on to appear in \u201cKindergarten Cop,\u201d \u201cPocahontas,\u201d and \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story.\u201d\n\napost.com\n\nHer Successful Life\n\nLinda Hunt (2015), (David Livingston/Getty Images)\n\nOne of Hunt\u2019s most recognized and loved roles was as Hetty Lange in \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles.\u201d She appeared on the show for the first 12 seasons as a main character and was a special guest star during the 13th season. Hetty is the Supervisory Special Agent and Operations Manager of the Office of Special Projects who embark on dangerous missions and cares deeply for others.\n\nIt seems like Hunt pulled from her personal life to add some genuineness to her character as she has proved time and again to be a kind-hearted individual. Although Hunt has kept much of her private life out of the public eye, relishing in the personal moments she gets to share with her loved ones; she has shared a few details about her relationships. She has been in a long-lasting relationship with psychotherapist Karen Kline since 1978. The two tied the knot in 2008.\n\nHunt has also served as an ambassador for the Best Friends Animal Society since 2011 and is a supporter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, according to Celebrity Net Worth. It\u2019s clear that Hunt has had a very successful relationship as well as a brilliant career. According to Celebrity Net Worth, her net worth is estimated at $12 million. She earned $80,000 per episode of \u201cNCIS: Los Angeles,\u201d totaling to about $2 million per year before royalties.\n\nAt 76 years old, Hunt can easily say she has accomplished a lot in her life and has become a true inspiration to any aspiring actor.

By the time she was seen with regularity on such hit procedurals as \"Without a Trace\" (CBS, 2002-09) and \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" (2009- ), Hunt was a familiar presence in several different mediums; a testament to both her talent and her ability to overcome the odds.\n\nBorn on April 2, 1945, in Morristown, NJ, Hunt moved to Westport, CT with her family while still an infant. Burdened with a host of health problems since birth, Hunt was misdiagnosed with cretinism at six months of age. While in her teens, she was correctly diagnosed with hypo-pituitary dwarfism, a condition in which the pituitary gland fails to release enough growth hormone. Ironically, or perhaps consequently, Hunt grew up an unusual overachiever, undaunted by her condition. She took her first stab at acting at age 12 while performing in a production of \"Flibbertigibbet\" at Westport's famed Silver Nutmeg Theater. Hunt moved to New York in the mid-1960s, where she found consistent work in summer stock theater. Concerned that her unusual physical type would limit her future as an actress, Hunt initially focused on becoming a stage director. But the lure of acting proved too powerful to resist, so in 1969, Hunt returned to Westport to study acting under dramatic coach, Robert Lewis.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hunt began a longtime association with the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. Her one-woman show based on the life of Joan of Arc won the actress rave reviews and even flickers of interest from Broadway. A year later, Hunt went to New York City and made her off-Broadway debut as the Player Queen in the New York Shakespeare Festival's production of \"Hamlet\" in Central Park. This led to Hunt's first major role as the Irish maid Nora in a 1973 production of Eugene O'Neill's play, \"Ah, Wilderness!\" Originally directed by Arvin Brown for the Long Wharf Theatre, the play eventually moved to the Circle-in-the-Square Theatre along the Great White Way in New York, where it was taped for airing as a PBS special, \"Theater In America\" (1976). Hunt's screen career began in the late 1970s, when she made her television debut in a \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" presentation of Arthur Miller's \"Fame\" (CBS, 1979). Adapted for the screen by the playwright himself, it was noteworthy that Miller specifically created Hunt's role of Mona with the actress in mind.\n\nThe following year, Hunt made her official big screen debut in Robert Altman's bloated and ultimately failed musical, \"Popeye\" (1980). Cast in a small supporting role as the feisty Mrs. Oxheart, Hunt's appearance was a fortunately forgettable cameo lost in an even more forgettable film that dogged stars Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall for years to come. Her next film, however, permanently changed her career. Tapped to co-star in the controversial drama \"The Year of Living Dangerously,\" Hunt joined burgeoning young actors Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver in director Peter Weir's complex drama. Based on a novel of the same name by Christopher Koch, the film told the complicated tale of an Australian journalist caught at the center of a foreign country's political overthrow. Based on the real-life events of the attempted 1965 coup of Jakarta by Indonesia's Communist party, \"Dangerously\" earned Hunt an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Eurasian photographer, Billy Kwan. The first actor to ever win an Oscar for playing a role of the opposite gender, Hunt's record stood untouched until 1999, when Hilary Swank won an Oscar for \"Boys Don't Cry.\"\n\nDespite her formidable talent, however, Hunt hit the proverbial glass ceiling. Though she remained consistently employed on stage - even winning two Obies and a Tony nomination in the 1980s and 1990s - the pedigree of her film work had slipped. Still, Hunt's presence in movies managed to endure throughout this period. Among her higher profile roles were supporting turns in such critical favorites as \"Silverado\" (1985), in which she played Stella, a genial saloon proprietor, and the blockbuster comedy, \"Kindergarten Cop\" (1990), portraying a school principle disapproving of a rough-and-tumble cop (Arnold Schwarzenegger) going undercover as a kindergarten teacher to capture a wanted fugitive. In 1993, Hunt briefly returned to television, starring in the ill-fated space opera, \"Space Rangers\" (CBS, 1993), which was cancelled after just six episodes. After a brief dormancy in the mid-to late 1990s, during which time she only appeared in the horror dud, \"The Relic\" (1997), Hunt's career underwent something of a renaissance when she turned to television. In 1997, Hunt created the role of Judge Zoey Hiller on David E. Kelly's long-running legal dramedy, \"The Practice.\" A favorite recurring character for the show's fans, Hunt reprised the role more than two dozen times before the show finally adjourned its run.\n\nIn 2003, Hunt joined the cast of the HBO drama \"Carnivale\" (HBO, 2003-05) for a 10-episode run as the mysterious voice of Management. In 2005, actress Hunt added an unlikely new credit to her resume: video game icon. As the resonant, authoritative voice of the Narrator for the award-winning \"God of War\" video game series, Hunt gained a whole new generation of fans unfamiliar with her acting work. Hunt reprised the voiceover role for the game's sequel, \"God of War 2.\" Following a long vacation away from features, Hunt finally returned to the big screen with the blended family comedy \"Yours, Mine, and Ours\" (2005), starring Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo. While her role was hardly much of a challenge for the actress, the movie did at least allow Hunt a rare opportunity to flex her comedic muscles. Her next project continued in the same vein, as Dr. Mittag-Leffler in director Marc Forster's twisted comedy, \"Stranger than Fiction\" (2006) starring Will Ferrell and Emma Thompson. After building a second career voicing narration for numerous PBS specials, including \"Secrets of the Ocean Realm\" (1997), \"Woodrow Wilson\" (2002) and \"Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State\" (2004), Hunt joined the cast of the successful spin-off series, \"NCIS: Los Angeles\" (CBS, 2009- ), playing OSP Operations Manager Henrietta Lange."}]}
