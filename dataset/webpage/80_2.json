The whole Peshawar garrison had been formed into three sides of an open square. The fourth was made up of forty cannons. Watching eagerly from the edge of the parade-ground were thousands of civilian spectators. Once the sentence had been read, the guns were primed with powder but no shot, and the prisoners were led forward. Each one was tied by the wrist to the upper part of the gun\u2019s wheels so that the muzzle pressed into the pit of his stomach. The artillery officer then gave the word and the guns were fired simultaneously. At first the smoke obscured all view. As it cleared, the only visible remnants of the prisoners were their arms, still attached to the guns. Then here and there, having been shot hundreds of feet into the air, fell a number of slightly blackened but otherwise intact heads\u2026\u201d\n\n- Saul David, The Indian Mutiny\n\n\n\nIn 1857, vast swaths of India were ruled by the East India Company, a British joint stock company that took corporate violence to a whole other level, exercising both military and administrative functions, as it sought to control trade and enrich itself. On May 10 of that year, however, after years of growing tensions, Indian soldiers revolted in Meerut, and then headed to Delhi, where they proclaimed the aging Bahadur Shah as the new Mogul Emperor. From there, the rebellion spread, threatening to kick Great Britain off the subcontinent.\n\n\n\nThis event goes by many names. In Great Britain, it was viewed as an insurrection, and referred to as \u201cthe Indian Mutiny\u201d or \u201cthe Sepoy Mutiny.\u201d For many in India, however, it was the First War of Independence, beginning a movement that would reach its apogee some ninety years later.\n\n\n\nWhatever it is called (for simplicity\u2019s sake, I\u2019ll refer to it as a mutiny), it was a bloody and vicious affair. Thousands of British soldiers and civilians were killed, while Indian casualties have been estimated as reaching into the hundreds of thousands. The war was marked by incredibly cruel acts, encompassing the murder of noncombatant women and children, the destruction of cities, and the macabre execution of alleged mutineers by being blown from cannons.\n\n\n\nIn The Indian Mutiny, Saul David attempts to capture this momentous struggle in just over four-hundred dense pages of text. Though devoid of any literary flair, and workmanlike in its presentation, I found this book to be a valuable overview of a complex subject. With maps, appendixes, a timeline, and a glossary, The Indian Mutiny does its best to be accessible without sacrificing its academic underpinnings.\n\n\n\nUtilizing a chronological approach, David starts with an introduction to the East India Company, and then proceeds methodically through the sequence of events from 1857 to 1859, discussing the causes of the mutiny, how it was organized, and how it ultimately played out across the country.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, this book reads like a military history. There is a lot of focus on the battles, and a somewhat obsessive accounting for all the various units involved. While David tries to touch on just about everything, the narrative coalesces around several major clashes, including the initial uprising in Delhi, along with its subsequent retaking; the siege of Lucknow; and the massacre at Cawnpore.\n\n\n\n(As an aside, some of the names used in the book have changed over time. For instance, Cawnpore is now Kanpur. David uses the 19th century English spellings).\n\n\n\nDespite battles being the centerpiece, the most interesting parts of The Indian Mutiny consist of David\u2019s analysis of the mutiny\u2019s origins. The list of Indian grievances against the East India Company was long. Not surprisingly, being ruled by a brutal for-profit foreign corporation topped that list. However, as David notes, the revolt began with Indian soldiers, and was motivated by such professional concerns as low pay, lack of advancement, disinterested British officers (who often left on detached duty to make more money), and a widening chasm between British and Indian society. Outside of that, the recent annexation of Oudh, a state in Northern India, also caused friction, especially for the troops from that region.\n\n\n\nPut simply, the situation in India resembled a tinder-dry forest, waiting for a spark.\n\n\n\nHistorically, that spark has been identified as the pre-greased cartridges used in the new Enfield rifles being supplied to the troops. Specifically, rumors abounded that the cartridges were greased with either tallow derived from beef or pork lard. (David believes those rumors to be based in truth). As a soldier had to tear the cartridge open with his teeth, exposing himself to either beef or pork grease, the cartridges were offensive to Hindus and Muslims respectively.\n\n\n\nCertainly, the belief in the animal-greased cartridges was real enough. And it definitely feels like the kind of ignorant, culturally insensitive move for which the British Empire was known. Yet, as David points out, Great Britain was actually quite responsive to Indian complaints, and went to pains to ensure that Indian soldiers could grease the cartridges themselves, to satisfy any doubts that animal fat was being used.\n\n\n\nTo David, the fact that this did not quiet the storm demonstrates that the greased cartridge controversy is a bit of a red herring. The real heart of the story is that the rebellion, far from being a spontaneous event, was the culmination of a carefully planned conspiracy. Though many of the members remain unknown, and some can only be speculated, David (who completed a PhD on the war\u2019s beginning) argues that outside influencers fanned discontent within Indian Army ranks in order to overthrow the East India Company. Thus, though it did not necessarily begin out of nationalist sentiment, it seems fair to say that the mutiny sought a nationalist outcome.\n\n\n\nThe challenge in a book like this is to recognize that the mutiny rests on the foundation of dual tragedies. The first, overarching tragedy is that of colonization, in which one group of people benefits at the expense of a lot of other people. The East India Company was a ruthlessly exploitative organization, and you can\u2019t tell this tale without acknowledging that. The second tragedy belongs to the individuals, both Indian and British, who were caught in the world as it existed at that time. The trick is in balancing these two realities, of describing \u2013 for instance \u2013 the horrors of the captive British women and children murdered at the Savada Kothi, while also recognizing the larger reasons while such a thing occurred.\n\n\n\nThough he succeeds imperfectly, David attempts to thread this particular needle by relying on a lot of different perspectives. This is important. Many histories of the Indian Mutiny/First War of Independence relied heavily on English-language accounts. For those Britons who survived, the war had been a traumatic experience, and they wrote about it. A lot. The obvious result of Anglo-centric interpretations is that Indian atrocities were given center stage, while British atrocities were minimalized, rationalized, or simply ignored.\n\n\n\nDavid does not fall into this trap. Indeed, part of the reason I chose to read The Indian Mutiny is because it was suggested by William Dalrymple, a well-respected historian of this era who is known for his dogged research into non-English sources. Though David is no Dalrymple, he does his level best to provide Indian viewpoints, so this does not become one more example of pro-Empire propaganda.\n\n\n\nOne of the interesting observations that David makes regarding the mutiny is how close it came to succeeding. With each town captured by Indian soldiers, with each garrison put to the torch, with every defeat of British troops, the rebellion grew. The East India Company could only hold India by exerting enough authority over its people to convince them that it was best to remain quiescent. As British losses started to mount, it became conceivable that a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of Indians would decide the time had come to join. That it did not happen was a result of the lack of strong central leadership. In the end, the choice to rally around the elderly, vacillating Bahadur Shah in Delhi doomed the enterprise.\n\n\n\nStill, a seed had been germinated that would, in time, mean the end of British rule in India."}, {"url": "https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/177983/victorias-wars-by-saul-david/9780141005553", "page_content": "In Victoria's Wars: The Rise of Empire Saul David explores the early part of Queen Victoria's reign,when the British Empire was well on the way to becoming the greatest empire the world had ever seen.\n\n\n\nThis is the story of how it happened and the people who made it happen. In a fast-moving narrative ranging from London to the harsh terrain of India, Russia and the Far East, Saul David shows how Britain ruthlessly exploited her position as the world's only superpower to expand her empire. Yet little of this territorial acquisition was planned or sanctioned by the home government. Instead it was largely the work of the men on the ground, and to those at home it really did seem that the empire was acquired in a 'fit of absence of mind'.

I was especially disappointed seeing as it was Saul David, who was responsible for this particular 'blunder' in writing history. I haven't really read any of his work in full but from what I have seen he has written some very well received titles and has even gone on to teach military history at the University of Buckingham. This is what makes this all the more frustrating for me.\n\n\n\nIt appears on David's section concerning the infamous Charge of the Light Brigade which in my opinion panders to the populist demographic and is full of contradictions. It's also full of many misconceptions about the personality and motivations of one of my favourite historical figures so I hope you understand if I get a little 'defensive' on my side of the fence. Forgive me if this turns into a bit of a rant but I think this particular piece is particularly notable as well as relevant since it was recently recycled in an issue of BBC History Magazine, some of it reading word to word. The Tory press was naturally all over it claiming that the Maxse letter was brand new when it has clearly been available for at least a decade as David used it in this book. They also claim that the idea of Nolan being the prime culprit is 'a new revelation' when in reality he has been blamed since day one. Seeing the comments in the Daily Fail was particularly hilarious, basically revolving around, 'Nolan was to blame because the movie told me so!'\n\n\n\nBasically Saul David claims that Nolan is primarily responsible for the disaster since he, according to the author, uttered the words 'attack' on his own initiative. I'm in the unpopular minority but I have some problems with this theory, mostly because, as mentioned by Terry Brighton in his much more in depth study on the charge, there were witnesses upon the Sapoune heights who saw Raglan shout the verbal order, 'Tell Lord Lucan the Cavalry is to attack immediately'. David denies Raglan uttered these words since it went against the written order, however historians such as Brighton, Allan Mallinson and David Buttery also agree that Raglan did not intend the brigade to conduct a full frontal attack, yet they don't automatically deny those who saw him shout those words. I wouldn't be surprised if Raglan did make that mistake, he was an inexperienced commander who was almost senile and had a terrible track record throughout the Crimean campaign. Raglan's mentor Wellington had also never lost a gun so wanting to follow his example it seems plausible in my view that those words may have slipped out in the midst his desperation as Nolan rode down the slope towards the valley, although as Brighton mentions his emphasis most likely fell upon the word 'immediately' rather than 'attack'. As well as that the author fails to mention that although it's content is unknown, Raglan had a brief discussion concerning the order with the Captain, mentioned by Raglan's nephew, Calthrope, likely implying that he had the terms of the order carefully explained to him. It's certainly a possibility that Nolan really did know what Raglan's order intended, before his commanding officer's sudden verbal order of 'attack immediately' conflicted the matter.\n\n\n\nI find it highly unlikely that Nolan tampered with the order. Frustrated with the light brigade's performance as he was, he was an ambitious man and not someone who previously went against his own professional interest. I'm not convinced that he would have been willing to throw away his hard earned career for an act of petty revenge against Lord Lucan. I don't even think he would risked uttering the word 'attack' in a more subtle way, assuming that Lucan would understand Raglan's real intention and link the fourth order to the third, because of his previous unwavering experience as an aide de camp. He was known before the day of the charge to be 'radical' for his time but not a callous man so I also doubt he was willing to throw away lives just to 'prove' the effectiveness of cavalry. Unless he was confused by the order or became too excited to absorb the message properly (which I as well as Buttery doubt) I don't think he would have deliberately misquoted an order, he nothing to gain from it but a court martial and shame after all, something which Nolan had no good reason to risk. What's more David dismisses the witnesses on the Sapoune heights yet is willing to accept sources claiming that Nolan asked Cardigan if the light brigade was afraid, although these particular sources were too far away from Nolan and Cardigan to actually hear the conversation. Buttery who searched quite thoroughly for a supporting primary source agrees it was most likely malicious gossip. Cardigan himself was never known to bring up this allegation against the Captain and was surprisingly sympathetic towards him after the disaster. It would have looked bad on Nolan's resume too, who, lacking the appropriate class and financial barriers, could not risk being responsible for such a scandal.\n\n\n\nSaul David contradicts himself when he implies that even if the order went according to plan, an attack or even just a threatening cavalry demonstration (as he mentions later in his article) along the causeway heights would have resulted in a disaster, or at least high casualties. Therefore Raglan's order was unnecessary and stupid in the first place, not to mention horribly written. The Russians even later denied that they were taking the guns that day. By this logic, Raglan should bear a large, perhaps the biggest portion of the responsibility but David still regards Nolan as 'chiefly responsible'. I also love how he, despite giving good reason for him to also bear a significant portion of the responsibility, gives Lord Lucan merely a slapped wrist. Despite the fact that he in his position of authority had the military and moral responsibility to query such an ambiguous order, especially one that had the potential to send many to their doom, many still claim he was scapegoated for the charge. It was not an infallible order as many Lucan apologists like to claim, in reality he did not have to blindly follow orders. Regardless of whether Nolan used the word 'attack' on his own initiative, Lucan should have done his job and put the captain in his place. It should also be considered that he somehow did not connect the order with his previous message which was to take any opportunity to recapture the heights. This fact is especially peculiar when you consider that Lucan was actually quite a competent soldier. David doesn't bring this crucial factor up much in his final verdict. What's most shocking however, and something which many historians including David simply brush off, is that he knew that charging at the guns at the end of the valley was ridiculous but instead of questioning Nolan further or even sending another man to Raglan to clarify, he decided to go along with it anyway.\n\n\n\nAlthough I don't see Nolan as entirely innocent on the day, he certainly should have better clarified the order since Lucan couldn't see where he was supposed to attack but considering the much greater positions of power of the other two suspects involved, I believe he shares the smallest portion of the blame and made the least impact overall. A.L. Berridge makes a fitting theory, although I disagree with her that Nolan misunderstood the order, she believes his death made a convenient cover up of the 'real' question, why Lord Raglan got the brilliant idea to come up with such an order in the first place? I'm becoming more convinced of this theory by the day, as Berridge states, 'Now that really IS a mystery', although Saul David will probably brand us both 'revisionists' as a result. The 'revisionist' in question was Clive Ponting (make of that what you will) who David criticised in the Torygraph for 'virtually ignoring' the role played by Lucan in the charge, despite the fact that he more or less did this in his BBC article over a decade later. Raglan and Nolan get whole paragraphs compared to Lucan's measly two sentences, and David doesn't bring up his 'extraordinary conclusion' at all. David explains it much better in this book but in a way that makes his argument that Nolan was to blame even worse.\n\n\n\nI honestly get the impression that David hates Captain Nolan since he seems to have fallen for the 'impulsive, quick tempered junior officer' image most popular in film and fiction. Firstly if Nolan was really a bad tempered individual or had such an excitable nature that it affected his ability to think straight as many 'pop' historians claim, he would have made a terrible horseman. Horses generally respond better to a calm collected approach, hence the words from Nolan's book 'Horses should be taught not by harshness but by gentleness'. I know this from having worked with horses myself! It should also be noted that in reality Nolan actually kept most of his sentiments towards his superiors, including Lucan in a private journal, had previously displayed no signs of being insubordinate and was not known to be someone who held everyone in contempt. Even with the assumption that he did use the word 'attack' on his own initiative, most likely in a subtle way if he did and not out of malicious intent, I highly doubt he was as nasty as Saul David depicts him. For example Buttery agrees that Nolan probably gave a heated response, but the idea that he actually taunted his commanding officer was most likely exaggerated drivel. It should be taken into account that many who knew him particularly those from his 15th Hussars regiment would often describe him as quite the opposite to the Devil's Incarnate seen in most popular depictions, some who met him such as the famous army wife Mrs Fanny Duberly even regarded him as a gentleman. Also Mr. David, Nolan's grudge against Lucan didn't come out of the blue as you imply, it came because the Captain had come back from a long, somewhat perilous journey to collect horses for the army and Lucan gave him nothing but crap for it.\n\n\n\nDavid puts his blame on Nolan I guess because despite, in my opinion the much more damning evidence on Raglan's and Lucan's end, the Maxse letter says all the cavalry blamed him. However many in the Crimea most likely blamed Nolan because if they openly blamed anyone higher up they would probably get into trouble. It should also be noted that Nolan was half Irish, not particularly wealthy, one of those 'horrid radicals', an intellectual and dead, a convenient scapegoat indeed. Just because one man lay his blame on the Captain does not make it true. I'd highly recommend to Mr. David and to anyone else interested in this debate to actually read about Captain Nolan for information on the real man's career, personality and life (Buttery's Messenger of Death is a great place to start), before simply 'shooting the messenger'.\n\n\n\nHowever if Nolan delivered the order to 'Lucas', as stated in a highlighted quote from the article, then I can wholeheartedly agree that he was responsible for any disaster that followed. We don't need another terrible Charge of the Light Brigade film, let alone one directed by Lucas.\n\n\n\nIs the rest of the book decent? I dunno, it could be great for all I know, but do you really expect me to take it seriously after a professional military historian like Saul David demonised an already historically vilified figure, and took such a simplistic and amateurish approach to such a complex event with complex characters? Understandably for Mr David, Messenger of Death was not around at the time of publication, yet here we are ten years later with his account rehashed in a BBC History magazine. Unless he was under pressure to get out something quickly to 'celebrate' the charge, it's pretty evident he has not picked it up during those intervening years or has read anything else concerning the Captain which challenges his more mythical depictions, which is sadly still common in non fiction books concerning the charge today. I have also seen some reviews which say the title itself is contradictory since it only talks about the wars up to Prince Albert's death! As well as this, other reviewers have gone on to say that this book has a tendency at times to waffle on about British politics and the personal life of Victoria, which I am sure make great reads on their own but considering this is a military history book, some of that could have been easily cut to fit in greater detail concerning other wars. Again these gripes were from other reviewers but that's what I've heard. I would like to know if this book is worth reading despite the issues I talked about but right now I'm not very convinced that it is worth my time, from what I have seen from this book, especially David's section on the Crimea, it seems like I have read all this before. What's more after all the problems I encountered with just one section of the book, I fear the same tabloidesque problems will be present within the rest of the text.
