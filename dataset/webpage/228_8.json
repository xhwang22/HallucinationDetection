The same principles apply whether the opponent is Oregon State or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing about playing for Coach was not necessarily the championships, but what he taught us about living life was far more important,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cI just recall the importance of the Pyramid of Success and the characteristics. What he taught us were lifelong lessons. So much of what he was teaching really had a parable of how you live your life.\u201d\n\nIn 1968, Vallely transferred from Orange Coast College to UCLA for his junior year. On the first day of practice, he looked around the locker room filled with teammates such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then known as Lew Alcindor), Lynn Shackelford, Curtis Rowe and Sidney Wicks. Wooden came in, unfolded a pair of socks and told his players how to put them on, making sure there were no creases or folds that could cause blisters.\n\nThis was during UCLA\u2019s run of seven consecutive championships, and Wooden took pains to eliminate even the slightest threat to the Bruins\u2019 dominance. Vallely wasn\u2019t just along for the ride. He started in both of his seasons, averaged 13.8 points and even outscored Abdul-Jabbar, 29-25, in a Final Four game.\n\n\u201cJohn was a great player for us,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said.\n\n\u201cHe delivered, consistently, in the crunch. I remember that. I was real happy to play with someone like that, that was versatile and wasn\u2019t going to shy away from taking the ball and doing something righteous with it when we needed it.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long after Vallely finished his college career in 1970 that Wooden started influencing his personal life. When Vallely was wavering on whether to propose to his girlfriend, Karen, Wooden jabbed a finger in his chest and said, \u201cYou marry that girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe still takes credit for it,\u201d Vallely says.\n\nVallely was drafted in the first round by the Atlanta Hawks but lasted only a couple of seasons before heading to Europe to play. He returned to Orange County for his post-basketball life, starting a ski clothing store and investing in real estate. Wooden grew from his coach to his mentor and friend, and his teachings became increasingly relevant.\n\n\u201cSo many of the things he said that had to do with basketball really had a lot to do with life,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cSuccess was more important than winning or losing the game.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, as Abdul-Jabbar had his children, he discovered himself applying the same approach he received from Wooden. Now he\u2019s proud of the four college graduates he raised.\n\n\u201cThe idea of challenging them to be at their best and pushing them at the times when they needed to be pushed, but not taking away their individuality, really started with how I was treated by John Wooden,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said. \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing man that way.\u201d\n\nWooden always defined success as \u201cpeace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best that you are capable of becoming.\u201d\n\nTo Vallely, that meant, \u201cBeing able to say, \u2018I have no conflict in my heart over my effort.\u2019 Carry that into your business life and family life, marital life. It puts a spring in your life and makes you want to do the best you can in those areas.\u201d\n\nIt enables him to triumph even through adversity. Vallely\u2019s 12-year-old daughter, Erin, died in 1991 after a three-year battle with pediatric cancer; since 1989 he has made children\u2019s cancer research funding his philanthropic mission.\n\nTreating kids with cancer is particularly difficult because \u201cthey react differently to chemotherapy, they\u2019re fast-growing and changing differently than adults,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s legacy is her mommy and daddy are trying to do something about that.\u201d\n\nFor assistance, he recruited a key player: his old coach.\n\nFor the last decade Vallely has been the host of exclusive private dinners with Wooden and moderated Q&A; sessions with him as part of the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation\u2019s annual \u201cBid for the Kids\u201d fundraising event. (This year the event, which included a live auction of sports memorabilia, netted $220,000.)\n\nEven at 95, Wooden keeps lending his name and showing up for free.\n\nAnd Vallely keeps learning. When someone asked Wooden the two most important words in his vocabulary, Wooden chose \u201clove\u201d and \u201cbalance.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis faith in God, love of family, love for the things you\u2019re involved in,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cBalance: not being too high, too low.\u201d\n\nThe way those lessons have taken root is evident in Vallely\u2019s response to the challenges life throws at him. He recently was diagnosed with a recurrence of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system.\n\nWhat struck me was how the tone of his voice sounded similar in a series of phone calls: on the evening before he went to Houston for more testing; the next day, when a test showed he might not have the disease after all; this week, when further tests indicated he did have it.\n\nAs always, he followed Wooden\u2019s advice.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018This is a bump in the road,\u2019 \u201d Vallely said. \u201cHe encouraged me to go forward. The way I treated it was to be the best patient I could be. Same old deal: Have peace of mind about that, give the doctor the best chance he could to heal me.\u201d\n\nIt worked once, and it\u2019s his best shot to beat it again.\n\n\u201cI wish it hadn\u2019t happened, but stuff happens to people,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cI look at what those kids go through, it\u2019s a mind-blower. There\u2019s always someone who has more difficult circumstances than you. My life has been good. I\u2019m pleased with that. I\u2019m hoping to carry on. But it is what it is.\u201d\n\nIt is a life enriched, still, by the man who taught him how to put on his socks 37 years ago.\n\n*\n\nJ.A. Adande can be reached at j.a.adande@latimes.com.

Give yourself the warming gift of his message--it's awesome--it will renew you!\u201d Deedreea Rich, DDS Newport Beach, California \u201cJohn's speech at his induction into the UCLA Hall of Fame was one of the most inspirational I have ever heard. It's obvious that John's passion for life and his belief in the \"Pyramid of Success\" has served him well from the glory days at UCLA to the unimaginable pain of losing a child to cancer. He tells his life story with heartfelt candor and wit, including examples of how the many facets of the \"Pyramid\" shape his daily life.

From the pinnacles of athletic success, to the depths of despair over the death of his beautiful 12 year old daughter, to his own two life-and-death struggles with lymphoma, his faith has been shaken, renewed, and then solidified.

John wove the concept of team building and relationships into everything he said and presented a talk that was interesting and motivational at the same time.

We have already asked him to return for two more events.\u201d Volunteer Endowment for Patient Support MD Anderson \u201cAs the speaker chairman for the Breakfast Club of Newport Beach, I can confidently say that John's presentation deeply touched everyone in our group on many levels.

A traditional story of competition and closeness between two generations of gifted athletes.\n\nBut basketball is only part of this story about former UCLA basketball star John Vallely and his son, Eric, a sharpshooting sophomore guard at Newport Harbor High in Newport Beach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe friendly elements, such as those about long games of H-O-R-S-E between father and son filled with impossible shots made over and around garage walls and trees, are here. The sense of companionship and the good-natured teasing and taunting between John and Eric, father and son, coach and player, friends, are here.\n\nAnd elements of sadness and loss are also here, as important a part as the NCAA tournament and the thrill of drilling a key three-pointer in a high school game last week.\n\nTragedy doesn\u2019t belong in this story, but it is here. But tragedy isn\u2019t the prevalent theme in the Vallely story.\n\nJohn, Eric and basketball have seen to that.\n\n\u201cThis is hard to talk about,\u201d John Vallely said, looking out a window briefly, then looking back. \u201cBut it\u2019s good to talk about.\u201d\n\nVallely and his wife, Karen, are talking about their daughter, Erin, who died Sept. 20 after a three-year fight against pediatric cancer. Erin was 12.\n\n\u201cShe was in remission early, and she was three months from finishing her therapy when the cancer came back,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cWe thought we had it licked, but the cancer cells were hiding from us. . . . They hid and they came back.\u201d\n\nWhen that recurrence was discovered in late spring, Erin was hospitalized. She remained in the hospital all summer.\n\nLittle remained the same for Eric or his parents during that time. John and Karen spent as much time with Erin as possible, which limited the shooting games and surfing expeditions that John and Eric were accustomed to.\n\n\u201cIt was hard, because I was alone a lot, but I understood,\u201d said Eric, 16. \u201cMom and Dad both checked on me a lot, and one of them was always at my summer league games or home for dinner.\n\n\u201cThings were a lot different without having Dad around to surf and shoot with as much, but in some ways it was good for me. They showed they trusted me to be by myself and be responsible, and it was nice to know that.\u201d\n\nJohn and Karen believe that Eric\u2019s maturity over the difficult summer has helped him in many ways, including on the basketball court.\n\n\u201cAs a player, Eric\u2019s made a lot of progress in the last year, and I think one of the reasons for that is because he\u2019s gotten stronger and tougher mentally,\u201d John said. \u201cEven though he\u2019s a 6-foot sophomore playing against a lot of bigger, physically stronger guys, he\u2019s not afraid of anybody out there. He\u2019s tenacious.\n\n\u201cI know some of that comes from his own competitive nature, but I think what we\u2019ve been through as a family has also contributed to his improvement.\u201d\n\nJohn, 43, went to Corona del Mar High and played two years at Orange Coast College before transferring to UCLA. With the Bruins, Vallely started for two NCAA championship teams--1969 and 1970--under John Wooden.\n\nVallely was a first-round pick of the Atlanta Hawks, later was traded to the Houston Rockets and played five seasons in the NBA.\n\nAlthough his teammates at UCLA included Lew Alcindor, as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was known then, Sidney Wicks and Curtis Rowe, many of Vallely\u2019s fondest recollections about the Bruins have to do with what he learned about life--not basketball--from Wooden.\n\n\u201cCoach Wooden\u2019s \u2018Pyramid of Success\u2019 is one of the most inspiring things I\u2019ve come across in my life,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cCoach Wooden taught me that the values and disciplines in the pyramid of success apply to every part of life, not just sports.\u201d\n\nDuring Erin\u2019s illness, the Vallelys found Wooden\u2019s teachings especially relevant.\n\n\u201cAt the top of the pyramid, success is defined as peace of mind, knowing that you\u2019ve done your best to win or succeed in whatever you\u2019re doing,\u201d Vallely said. \u201cWith Erin, my heart is broken and it always will be, but I know we did everything we could and she did everything she could to beat it. Now that God\u2019s taken her, life has to go on.\u201d\n\nAt Newport Harbor, Eric averages 13 points a game. He moved up to start for the varsity after playing freshman basketball last season. Like his father, Eric is an excellent long-range shooter, and twice this season has made four three-point baskets in one game.\n\n\u201cLike his dad, Eric is a shooter and a tremendous competitor,\u201d Newport Harbor Coach Bob Serven said. \u201cHe\u2019s earned everything he\u2019s gotten here, including the green light to shoot whenever it\u2019s a good shot.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a great attitude all along and never expected any favoritism. He\u2019s proved he belongs at this level.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Eric shoots well, considering his father has been coaching him since Eric took an interest in the game in the third grade. Since then, John has coached Eric at almost every level, including last year\u2019s Newport Harbor freshman team.\n\nAs an assistant coach with the freshmen, John helps the young players in the program with their techniques and fundamentals and also keeps his own shooting skills sharp for his H-O-R-S-E games with Eric.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t play me one-on-one anymore,\u201d Eric said, smiling. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t played me in a year because he\u2019s scared of getting beat. Now all he does is play H-O-R-S-E and complain about not having the three-point shot when he played.\u201d\n\nOf course, John sees the situation a little differently.\n\n\u201cI just decided to retire undefeated against Eric in one-on-one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts too much now, anyway. The last time I played him, I couldn\u2019t move for three days. But I did beat him.\u201d\n\nBasketball has helped the Vallelys continue their lives, especially during this holiday season. Their home is decorated for Christmas, and Eric has yet to break any of the lights that loop above and around the basket mounted on the garage.\n\n\u201cUsually, I break at least a couple before Christmas,\u201d Eric said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be all right this year.\u201d"}, {"url": "http://www.johnvallelymotivates.com/", "page_content": "\u201cJohn was a perfect fit into the goals of our meeting as well as teaching us all to be better team members on our quest to being \"One Ply Gem\".

Give yourself the warming gift of his message--it's awesome--it will renew you!\u201d Deedreea Rich, DDS Newport Beach, California \u201cJohn's speech at his induction into the UCLA Hall of Fame was one of the most inspirational I have ever heard. It's obvious that John's passion for life and his belief in the \"Pyramid of Success\" has served him well from the glory days at UCLA to the unimaginable pain of losing a child to cancer. He tells his life story with heartfelt candor and wit, including examples of how the many facets of the \"Pyramid\" shape his daily life. I feel honored to have John as a friend, and thank him for one of the most entertaining evenings I have ever experienced.\u201d Dee DeVaney Retired Airline Pilot\n\n\u201cJohn's story moves his listeners to both tears and laughter, and his ability to weave his life's message around John Wooden's Pyramid of Success is masterful. From the pinnacles of athletic success, to the depths of despair over the death of his beautiful 12 year old daughter, to his own two life-and-death struggles with lymphoma, his faith has been shaken, renewed, and then solidified. John's commitment to useing the Pyramid of Success to face and overcome life's adversites is truly inspirational.\u201d Bob Kendall, Self-employed Mathematics Tutor Karen Kendall, School Administrator \u201cNever have I been so proud. You were on fire last night.That was the greatest moment in the history not only of UCLA Basketball but in the history of Western civilization. You have changed my life. You are an unbelievable humanitarian. I want to thank you for everything, John. You are up there with Nelson Mandela, Desmond Tutu, Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and John Vallely. The list is endless. Oh my gosh! What a performance! Forget the jump shot, forget the rebounds, forget the defense, forget the leadership, what you did last night was the greatest thing that any man has ever done in this world as we know it. Intergalactic transmission is the next order of the day. Please, Lets get it going. I have never been so proud. I have been 6ft 11 since I was 19 yrs old; today I have broken the 7 ft. barrier. I have reached nirvana because of you. We are so happy for you.

John wove the concept of team building and relationships into everything he said and presented a talk that was interesting and motivational at the same time. Best of all, he did his homework about the group he was speaking to and included specific references about them in his talk. This personalized presentation was impressive. We have already asked him to return for two more events.\u201d Volunteer Endowment for Patient Support MD Anderson \u201cAs the speaker chairman for the Breakfast Club of Newport Beach, I can confidently say that John's presentation deeply touched everyone in our group on many levels. In telling his life's story, his ability to blend his humility, strength and humor was powerful. What our group especially appreciated was the way John wove the principles of the great John Wooden into his own life in a such an honest manner that any one could relate, even a die-hard Trojan like myself. He is truly a terrific communicator of John Wooden's principles and of his own hard won wisdom.\u201d Bob Bernatz, Ph.D. President \u2013 InsightGlobal \u201cI am grateful that John Vallely participated as one of the Distinguished Speaker\u2019s for the Volcom University.

BOTTOM: Henry Bibby, Terry Schofield, Andy Hill.\n\nJohn Vallely Today\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely, age 53, was raised in Orange County and now lives in Newport Beach. During his college days, John was a member of the UCLA Bruins basketball team and participated in two National Championship seasons, 1969 and 1970, under legendary coach John Wooden. John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin. When Erin was 9 years old she was diagnosed with cancer, and eventually lost her battle, at the age of 12, in 1991. Since then, John and Karen have been committed to fighting pediatric cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, John is completing treatment for his own illness, lymphoma, and is very optimistic about his recovery. John says he uses Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success strategy to deal with his cancer. Wooden\u2019s philosophy, according to Vallely, focuses on success rather than winning. \u201cI have no conflict in my heart about knowing that I am the best I can be and so I have peace of mind,\u201d John says. \u201cSuccess is the absence of conflict. Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.johnvallely.com/bio", "page_content": "About John Vallely\n\nJohn Vallely is an Irish screen composer, arranger and song-writer.

But if the Lakers could win \u2014 something they had done 20 consecutive times before \u2014 they\u2019d celebrate on the court with a ceremony and in the locker room with champagne.\n\n1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers team photo at the Forum\n\n(Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nOn Sunday, Dec. 12, 1971, the Lakers won their 21st consecutive game, setting the record for the longest winning streak in NBA history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure glad it\u2019s over,\u201d Wilt Chamberlain said that night.\n\nYet the Lakers\u2019 winning streak wasn\u2019t close to ending. And the record they set \u2014 the longest winning streak in team sports \u2014 is still standing 50 years later.\n\nThe Lakers would win 33 straight games, an unfathomable achievement that spanned the course of 65 days during the team\u2019s magical championship season, the franchise\u2019s first after relocating from Minneapolis in 1960.\n\nLakers guard Jerry West (14) is fouled by Rockets guard John Vallely after driving around a screen by center Wilt Chamberlain on Dec. 27, 1971. (Associated Press)\n\nThe Lakers scored 4,069 points during the streak, beating their opponents by an average of 16 points per game. Only one team, the Phoenix Suns, took them to overtime. And 24 times, opponents couldn\u2019t keep the margin inside 10 points.\n\nChamberlain, Jerry West, Gail Goodrich, Pat Riley and Bill Sharman \u2014 the names on their own are legendary. But as part of the 1971-72 Lakers, they combined to create an accomplishment that\u2019s still standing strong thanks to a combination of excellence, talent, time and place.\n\n\u201cIf that 33-game winning streak at the time happened today with all the social media and coverage,\u201d Riley, a backup guard on the team, told The Times, \u201cit would be probably be almost unbearable to do.\u201d\n\nRiley should know. The Miami Heat team he helped assemble, with LeBron James and Chris Bosh joining Dwyane Wade, ripped off 27 consecutive wins in 2013. The Golden State Warriors pushed up against the fringes of the Lakers\u2019 streak, winning 28 in a row over two regular seasons in 2015.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been close to being threatened since then.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I don\u2019t want to see it broken \u2014 at least during my lifetime,\u201d said Jim Cleamons, a rookie on the Lakers\u2019 1971-72 team. \u201cIt\u2019s like Joe DiMaggio. I don\u2019t think anybody is going to beat his 56-game hitting streak, so I don\u2019t want anybody to beat our 33-game winning streak. I\u2019ll be honest about that. I don\u2019t want to see it broken.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just sorry it wasn\u2019t a little bit higher. I would have like to have really put it out there.\u201d\n\nAll winning streaks before it and after it have started the same way \u2014 following a loss. But only the greatest streak in professional team sports could start with a loss like this.\n\nElgin Baylor wasn\u2019t just a Laker at the time \u2014 he was the Lakers. He followed the team to Los Angeles from Minneapolis, bringing with him an electrifying style of play that would be mimicked by the NBA\u2019s most exciting players for generations to come.\n\nLakers coach Bill Sharman yells instruction from the bench during the 1971-72 season. (Art Rogers / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThat version of Baylor was gone, an Achilles injury and achy knees slowing the Lakers\u2019 most dynamic player to a crawl. Sharman, the Lakers\u2019 new coach, wanted to make a change and move the 37-year-old Baylor out of the starting lineup.\n\nBaylor, having played in only nine games before the winning streak began, instead retired. He made the decision after the Lakers lost to the Golden State Warriors by four points on Oct. 31, 1971.\n\n\u201cHe was not getting the kind of results that he expected of himself,\u201d Goodrich said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re that good \u2014 boy, he was that good \u2014 and you start to see your skills diminished a little bit. \u2026 And while you can still make a contribution, I think that, you know, his benchmark was so high for himself.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to fathom, especially for West.\n\n\u201cMy buddy, my friend, my cohort for so many years, I just sat there and said to myself, \u2018How the hell is this going to be without him in the locker room?\u2019 \u201d West remembered wondering. \u201cIt just was a shock for me. I had no clue, absolutely no clue that he was going to retire. None. I said, \u2018What?\u2019 when I heard about it. \u2026 How did this happen? Why?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it was so shocking for him not to be there. But as I say, they don\u2019t cancel school when a teacher leaves. So, they\u2019re certainly not cancelling a basketball season, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nFor Sharman, it wasn\u2019t the first time the team\u2019s coach was in the midst of a challenge. Before he lost Baylor, he needed to first convince West to shoot less and distribute the ball more. Admittedly, that sell was easier than the other one he needed to make.\n\nHe needed to convince Chamberlain to wake up early.\n\nSharman was the inventor of the \u201cshootaround\u201d \u2014 a morning practice on game days designed to increase players muscle memory and focus before competition. It also meant an extra trip to the arena, with Chamberlain firing back that Sharman would see him at the Forum once per day \u2014 either for practice or the game.\n\nLike the best jokes, it was full of truth.\n\nBut Sharman had Chamberlain\u2019s respect from his time as Bob Cousy\u2019s backcourt partner during the Boston Celtics\u2019 dynasty. Sharman believed in work ethic, a tone he set during the team\u2019s training camp in Hawaii.\n\nAfter a lunch with Chamberlain, he got the Lakers center on board.\n\nLike West, he also convinced Chamberlain \u2014 owner of another iconic record, his 100-point game \u2014 to sacrifice on offense to anchor the Lakers\u2019 defense and rebounding, while playing quarterback for Sharman\u2019s fast-break offense.\n\nAfter Baylor\u2019s retirement, Sharman turned to West and Chamberlain to be the team\u2019s co-captains. West felt he\u2019d play better without the responsibility, so Chamberlain took on the task alone, he wrote in his autobiography, \u201cWilt: Just like any other 7-foot black millionaire who lives next door.\u201d\n\nWith Chamberlain as the captain and young Jim McMillian replacing Baylor in the starting lineup, the Lakers eased into their new reality with a tight win at home against the Baltimore Bullets.\n\n\u201cMcMillian stepped in. He fit right in \u2014 a good quality scorer, a very, very good defensive player,\u201d Goodrich said. \u201cAnd so, at that point, you know, there was there was no drop off. And we were off.\u201d\n\nLakers Complete coverage: The Lakers\u2019 33-game winning streak 50th anniversary For 65 days and 33 games, the Los Angeles Lakers were unbeatable during the 1971-72 season. Here\u2019s a look back at the winning streak 50 years later.\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t lose again for more than two months.\n\nLegendary Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn narrated a record with highlights of the team\u2019s 33 wins, praising the Lakers for catching their rhythm with a 40-point win in Philadelphia for their fifth consecutive victory.\n\n\u201cOne of the best games in the history of the Lakers,\u201d Hearn exclaimed that night.\n\nIf there were questions about Chamberlain\u2019s buy-in to Sharman\u2019s plan, he answered them against the Boston Celtics, managing to dominate despite scoring only three points in two shots and one trip to the free-throw line.\n\nChamberlain finished that win \u2014 the Lakers\u2019 eighth in a row \u2014 with 31 rebounds, 10 assists and, according to Hearn, 13 blocked shots for one of the strangest triple-doubles in NBA history.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty to watch, I\u2019ll say that. It was pretty to watch,\u201d West remembered. \u201cEveryone shared in different ways. And I\u2019ll never forget that before the season started, Bill Sharman asked me, he said, \u2018I want you to lead the league in assists.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019ll try, if I can.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter my knee injury, I wasn\u2019t the same player at all. I think I averaged almost 26 points a game even that way. But these games were easy because you just didn\u2019t feel the pressure to score all the time and it got easier for us. Everyone had a role and they performed it.\u201d\n\nWest and Chamberlain were the veterans. Goodrich was the scorer. McMillian provided the two-way support. Happy Hairston was a rebounding machine. Flynn Robinson, the team\u2019s sixth man, could really shoot, and Riley was equally fearless and ferocious. John Trapp and Leroy Ellis reveled in the dirty work.\n\nThe Lakers kept piling up wins, even more impressively considering of how differently the NBA was scheduled in 1971-72. The winning streak began with victories on three straight nights. The first five games of the 33 were played in six days. The first eight wins? That happened in 10 days. Add in commercial travel the morning following games, and the physical demands were incredible.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty incredible stat that the a lot of people don\u2019t realize,\u201d Goodrich said.\n\nThey fell into routines, Goodrich leaving the court after the same made shot before every game and West playing in the same sneakers throughout the run.\n\nBy the time the Lakers hosted the Atlanta Hawks on Dec. 12, people certainly realized the stakes. A win would break the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 record of 20 straight wins during their championship run the season before, immortalizing Sharman\u2019s team. The fans counted down the final seconds before the 21st win in the streak.\n\nLakers guard Gail Goodrich (25) and center Wilt Chamberlain (13) defeated guard Dave Wohl and the 76ers during their 33-game winning streak. (Associated Press)\n\nThe postgame locker room was a wild scene, Hearn and partner Lynn Shackleford interviewing players while they celebrated.\n\n\u201cI believe this is the greatest thrill,\u201d Sharman said.\n\nOwner Jack Kent Cooke told Hearn he nearly suffered a heart attack as the Lakers desperately held on.\n\n\u201cBut it was all worth it, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to Hearn.\n\nTen days later in Baltimore, the Lakers got 37 points and nine assists from West to pass the 1916 New York Giants with 27 straight wins. Those Giants had won 26 without a loss, though there was a non-counting tie during their streak.\n\nAnd in Atlanta on Jan. 7, the Lakers were as dominant as ever, making 58% of their shots while six players scored in double figures in a blowout win against Pete Maravich and the Hawks.\n\nIt was the team\u2019s 33rd win in a row.\n\nTwo days later in Milwaukee against the defending NBA champions, the Lakers would finally lose 120-104.\n\n\u201cWe went into the locker room after the game and it was over with, the 33 wins a row,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe got on a plane.\u201d\n\nThe season would end with another victory that ended another streak: The Lakers finally won an NBA championship after losing seven finals in the first 11 years since moving to L.A. But the memory of the 33-game win streak would always linger.\n\n\u201cSome 2\u00bd months without losing a game,\u201d West said. \u201cPretty remarkable.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.patrickspeople.scot/our%20family/13362.htm", "page_content": "Family Links Spouses/Children:\n\n1.
