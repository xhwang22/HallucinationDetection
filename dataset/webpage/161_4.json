Miller\n\nRobert \u201cBob\u201d A. Miller, a native of Portage, Pennsylvania, played halfback for the Emory & Henry football team from 1948-51. He played during the era before official school statistics were kept, but estimates based on newspaper clippings and old microfilm indicate that he accumulated a total career \u201cground gain\u201d (a combination of rushing, receiving, and returns) of over 3,000 yards. Miller, who was known as \u201cThe Emory Express\u201d for his rushing ability, was inducted as a charter member into the E&H Sports Hall of Fame in 1972.\n\nMiller, who had intended to go to Florida State on a football scholarship before Coach Conley Snidow convinced him to join the Wasps, made quite an impact at Emory & Henry College. In his sophomore year, Miller was named to the Little All-America Second-Team and the All-Little Six First-Team, and he was the top scorer in Virginia, with a total of 102 points over twelve games. The team itself had a perfect 10-0 record. His junior year, 1950, he was both a Little-All America and All-Little Six first-teamer and again led the state in scoring, with 114 points in 11 games. He capped off his senior year as a three-time All-American and three-time top scorer in the state of Virginia, as well as being named the Virginia State All-Division Player of the Year.\n\nOver Miller\u2019s four-year career, the Wasps went 31-8-1, mounting an impressive 28-1-1 record during his sophomore through senior years. In 1949 and 1950, the Wasps were invited to the Burley Bowl and the Tangerine Bowl. He scored a career total of 379 points, the highest in college history at the time of his graduation. His estimated ground gain record stood for thirty-five years until it was broken by the legendary Hall of Fame member Sandy Rogers in 1986. His jersey number has been retired by the Emory & Henry football team, a distinction he shares with only three other players.\n\nMiller was a U.S. Army veteran, having served in the Korean War. While in the Army, he played football for the base team at Fort Eustis until he injured a knee. After his service, he settled in Tazewell, where he was teacher and football coach at Tazewell High School for nine years. He went on to become a businessman and real estate developer in the Tazewell area, and he served on the town council and the board of governors.\n\nRobert Miller died of a heart attack on December 1996 in Bluefield, West Virginia. Miller left Emory & Henry holding 10 records, and in 2006 he was inducted posthumously into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame."}, {"url": "https://footballfoundation.org/sports/2018/7/31/college-football-hall-of-fame-trivia.aspx", "page_content": "Thanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"}, {"url": "https://californiasportshalloffame.org/inductees/bob-miller/", "page_content": "2011 CALIFORNIA SPORTS HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE\n\nHockey Hall of Famer Bob Miller is in his 37th season as the \"Voice of the Kings\" -- the first 17 years simulcast on TV and radio and the last 19 years as the exclusive television voice of the team -- and is again joined for the 20th season by former Kings right winger Jim Fox for all Kings games on FS West.\n\nOn November 13, 2000, Miller was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, where a plaque hangs, as the recipient of the annual Foster Hewitt Memorial Award as selected by the NHL Professional Broadcasters\u2019 Association.

The game marked Murphy's final appearance as a head coach, and he transitioned fulltime to athletics director, a role he had started in 1966 and held until 1981.Murphy grew up in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, before enrolling at Mississippi State in 1939 and playing as an All-SEC tailback for future College Football Hall of Coachwho had previously headed the Memphis program. In 1943 and the midst of World War II, Murphy joined the Marine Corps Reserve and transferred to Duke University for training with the V-12 Program. He served heroically in the South Pacific, narrowly escaping with his life on at least four occasions and receiving the Bronze Star, the Presidential Citation and the Navy Citation. Following World War II, Murphy returned to Mississippi State as the captain of the 1946 Bulldogs team.After graduating from Mississippi State, Murphy took his first job as an assistant coach at Memphis for a five-year stint. In 1951, he returned to Mississippi State under head coachwho he then followed to Minnesota in 1954 for four seasons as the running backs coach before becoming the Memphis head coach at the age of 37 in 1958. Murphy has been inducted into the State of Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, the Mississippi State Hall of Fame and the Memphis M Club Hall of Fame. Each year the Billy J. Murphy Award is presented to a former Memphis athlete who has excelled in their chosen profession after graduation, and the Tigers' practice facility is named in Murphy's honor.Standing at No. 20 for most wins in Football Bowl Subdivision history at the time of his retirement,'s legacy as the winningest coach in school history at both Toledo and Missouri makes him one of only three coaches to hold the distinction at two Division I programs. He becomes the first coach from Toledo and the sixth coach from Missouri inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.Pinkel began his head coaching career at Toledo in 1991 and during the next 10 years he would take the Rockets to new heights, winning 65.9 percent of his games and amassing a 73-37-3 record, the most wins in school history. His nine winning seasons at Toledo included the 1995 MAC championship, with the Rockets going 11-0-1 and finishing at No. 24 in the final polls. Pinkel would lead Toledo to three other MAC West Division titles. In 1997, the Rockets finished 9-3, climbing as high as No. 18 in the national rankings. They repeated as division champions again in 1998 with a 7-5 record. In his final season with the Rockets in 2000, the team went 10-1, including a 24-6 win at Penn State. The team finished the regular season with the MAC West Division title and ranked No. 25 in the AP Poll. He was named the MAC Coach of the Year in 1995 and 1997.Pinkel took over at Missouri in 2001, inheriting a program that had produced just one 10-win season in school history and two winning seasons in the previous 17 years. Pinkel would transform the program, leading the Tigers to 10 winning seasons (including five years with 10 wins or more), five conference division titles, 10 bowl appearances and six bowl victories. The end result: an overall record of 118-73 and the distinction of being the school's all-time winningest coach.Pinkel's Missouri teams posted final top-20 national rankings five times, including AP rankings of No. 4 in 2007 and No. 5 in 2013. In 2007, he was named the National Coach of the Year by FieldTurf, and he won conference coach of the year honors in 2007 (Big 12) and 2014 (SEC). In 2007, Mizzou claimed the school's first No. 1 national ranking since 1960 after a watershed 36-17 win against archrival Kansas in the Border Showdown at Arrowhead Stadium on Nov. 24, 2007. The Tigers subsequently fell short against Oklahoma in the Big 12 title game, but the team ended the season with a school-record 12 wins, including a win in the Cotton Bowl and a No. 4 final national ranking.Pinkel's finest year may have come in 2013, one year after Mizzou joined the SEC. Picked to finish sixth in the SEC Eastern Division, the Tigers finished 11-1 as East Division champs, and they gave Pinkel his second victory in the Cotton Bowl and his second 12-win season along with a final No. 5 ranking in the national polls. Pinkel would lead the Tigers back to the SEC Championship Game in 2014, falling short against Alabama. The team finished the season with a win against Minnesota in the Citrus Bowl and an 11-3 record and No. 14 ranking in the AP Poll.After his final game in 2015 and announcing his retirement because of a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Pinkel ranked as the third-winningest active coach behind future College Football Hall of Fame inducteesof Virginia Tech andof Kansas State. Pinkel also is one of only three coaches in history to be the winningest coach of two college football programs, joining College Football Hall of Fame inductees(Kentucky, Alabama) and(Florida, South Carolina). Pinkel coached 10 First Team All-Americans, three Academic All-Americans, three NFF National Scholar-Athletes and 79 first team all-conference players.Prior to becoming a head coach, Pinkel was an all-conference and Honorable Mention All-America tight end at Kent State, playing for future College Football Hall of Fame Coach. Pinkel worked as an assistant under James at Washington for 12 years, including the Huskies' 1991 national championship team. He also served as an assistant at Kent State and Bowling Green.Pinkel has been inducted into multiple halls of fame, including the State of Missouri Sports, St. Louis Sports Commission, Mid-American Conference, Toledo Athletics, Kent State Athletics and Kenmore High School. Active in the community, he created the GP Made Foundation to help youth facing difficult challenges and he has raised more than $10 million for charitable causes. In 2017, Pinkel released an autobiography \"The 100-Yard Journey: A Life in Coaching and Battling for the Win.\"Founded in 1947 with early leadership from General Douglas MacArthur, legendary Army coach Earl \"Red\" Blaik and immortal journalist Grantland Rice, The National Football Foundation & College Hall of Fame is a non-profit educational organization that runs programs designed to use the power of amateur football in developing scholarship, citizenship and athletic achievement in young people.

He posted a 79.8 winning percentage during his remarkable 18-year tenure, returning the Sooners to one of the elite programs in college football. Stoops is the sixth Oklahoma coach to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nPrior to his arrival at Oklahoma, the proud Sooner program was five years removed from a winning record and hadn't produced double-digit victories since 1987. Coaching at Oklahoma from 1999-2016, Stoops never had a losing record en route to a school record 190 career wins, including 14 seasons of 10-plus victories (the most of an FBS coach from 2000-16). He led the Sooners to four BCS National Championship Game appearances, winning the 2000 national title after a perfect 13-0 season that culminated with a win over Florida State in the Orange Bowl. Leading OU to a bowl game in each of his 18 seasons (a school record), Stoops claimed nine postseason victories, including wins in the Cotton, Fiesta, Orange, Rose and Sugar bowls. The sixth-fastest coach to ever reach 150 wins (187 games), he guided the Sooners to top 25 finishes in all but three seasons, including seven top five rankings.\n\n\n\nA two-time national coach of the year and six-time Big 12 Coach of the Year, Stoops led Oklahoma to 10 Big 12 titles while posting an impressive 121-29 (.807) conference record during his career. His teams averaged 10.6 wins per season, and he owned a 101-9 home record, with wins in each of his first 37 games at Gaylord Family \u2013 Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. Stoops' 2008 team went down as the highest scoring team in college football history, scoring a total of 716 points and averaging 51 points per game. A combined 25-11 against the Sooners' biggest rivals Oklahoma State and Texas, he also posted a 66.7 winning percentage vs. AP Top 25 teams, the best in the country during his reign at OU.\n\n\n\nStoops coached 38 First Team All-Americans at Oklahoma, including seven Heisman Trophy finalists and two winners in Jason White (2003) and Sam Bradford (2008). He also coached three NFF National Scholar-Athletes, including 2015 Campbell Trophy\u00ae recipient Ty Darlington. In 2019, Stoops was inducted into the OU Sports Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nA four-year starter at Iowa under College Football Hall of Fame Coach Hayden Fry, Stoops excelled in 1982 as a team captain, First Team All-Big Ten selection and Iowa's MVP. The Youngstown, Ohio, native began his coaching career as an assistant under Fry at Iowa, followed by a stint at Kent State. After coaching under Hall of Famer Bill Snyder at Kansas State, he joined Hall of Famer Steve Spurrier's staff and helped the Gators win the 1996 national title as defensive coordinator.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, he started the Bob Stoops Champions Foundation to provide support to children and families in the Norman and Oklahoma City areas. In 2018, Stoops joined with current OU head coach Lincoln Riley and College Football Hall of Fame Coach Barry Switzer to create the HBC Champions Foundation to supply financial contributions, positive experiences and support to ill or disadvantaged children in Oklahoma. After briefly coming out of retirement in 2020 to coach the Dallas Renegades in the XFL, he now serves as a special assistant to the athletics director at OU."}]}
