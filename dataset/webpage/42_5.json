At the age of 12, he obtained his first prize in drawing at the Junior Seminary of Coll\u00e8ge St-Martial in 1966.\n\nHis parents, Georgette B and \u00c9tienne L Dodard, introduced him to painting and drawing at an early age. At the age of 15, he joined the \u201cPoto Mitan\u201d, a free art school directed by Jean Claude \u201cTiga\u201d Garoute, Patrick Vilaire, and Wilfrid \u201cFrido\u201d Casimir. They were all three famous painters of the twentieth century in the Haitian artistic sector.\n\nA brilliant start to a career\n\nAlthough he began painting at a very early age, his career only really took off in 1981. Thanks to the support of Mich\u00e8le Frisch (director of the MUPANAH at the time), the Marassa gallery in P\u00e9tion-Ville hosted his first major exhibition. An exhibition that takes place around the theme \u201cAquatism\u201d. And since then, his success has been undeniable.\n\nHis paintings, exhibited in many museums abroad, will be the subject of aesthetic debates on the modernity of Haitian contemporary art. He immediately attracted the attention of many art critics, notably in Haiti, Brazil, France, the United States, and the Caribbean.\n\nHis itinerary\n\nHowever, it should be remembered that he was an accountant by training. After these studies, he entered the Academy of Fine Arts (now called ENARTS), then the National School of Bordeaux, to study plastic arts. He ended up specializing in educational graphics.\n\nOn his return from Bordeaux, he was appointed head of the graphic department of the Deschamps publishing house. For 10 years, he was the artistic director of the ironwork company \u201cMulti-ad\u201d. This company was created in collaboration with Monique Gard\u00e8re.\n\nIn the late \u201970s and early \u201980s, he studied at the Kripalu yoga center. This approach will propel him towards the learning of the being, the spiritual, and the samurai and martial arts. He was even led to the practice of Kundo. He then studied the science of Reiki (initiation to alternative medicine).\n\nPhilippe Dodard, current director of the National Superior School of Art (ENARTS), intends to fulfill the mission that this entity has given itself since its creation in the 1980s: to maintain the reputation of the Haitian culture and the influence of its art.\n\n\u201c\u2026Improve the quality of training, upgrade the various departments and offer students the best opportunities to promote the development of their talents, refound the school in perdition, renovate the foundry (to become again at the service of the Haitian nation) and restore the monument of the Indian are, among others, the objectives set,\u201d he noted in an interview with the local newspaper.\n\nCommitted artist and entrepreneur\n\nThe cultural advisor for Elisabeth D. Pr\u00e9val (former First Lady of the Republic of Haiti), he will install on the Place Saint-Pierre and the Champ de Mars \u201cPlas timoun\u201d, an art therapy center that focuses on rehabilitating street children through the arts.\n\nAs head of the ironworks site in the reconstruction project of the iron market, destroyed in the January 12 earthquake, he is saving the pride of Port-au-Prince, this historic site classified as a national heritage. This unique reconstruction was inaugurated in January 2011. \u201cIt was a rewarding experience where I had the opportunity to apply my knowledge of ironwork and design,\u201d says Dodard.\n\n\u201cBy partnering with Dimitry and Evelyne Craan on this restoration project, I had the pleasure of training many workers. And I am happy that the project has achieved its triple dimension: to give back, through citizen involvement, life to the city; to succeed in this challenge of human management (about 400 workers were at work) and to put in place one of the symbolic monuments of the identity of Port-au-Prince, much visited by tourists,\u201d he added.\n\nThe \u201cDodard of the Year\u201d prize is awarded each year to a personality of the artistic milieu who has distinguished himself or herself in an artistic or sporting field. The first winner, Philippe Dodard recalls, was Madeline Paill\u00e8re, an art critic.\n\nFranck\u00e9tienne (painter and writer), Aubelin Jolicoeur and Nancy Roc (journalists), Lionnel Abelard (Karateka), Beethova Obas (musician), the former Haitian president Michel Martelly, Edwidge Danticat, more recently, have all been awarded.\n\nDodard\u2019s work : criticism\n\nHis work sparked a debate in 2006 on the issue of Haitian art and modernism, drawing on such notables as Michel Philippe Lelebourg, Michel Frisch, Franketienne, Bob Corbett, Greg Thomas, Babacard Embou, Nkil Negou, and Legrace Benson. A large-scale exhibition of his work at the Broward Library Museum in 2006 led to the publication of the book: Dodard\u2019s Work.\n\n\u201cThis book demystifies Picasso and his authority in contemporary art. The contributors look at my African, Native American, and European-inspired work. This document reflects my very spiritual bent for art, my interest in voodoo.\u201d he says. His paintings, acrylics on fabric reflect Tiga\u2019s influence, holding the \u201cArtistic Rotation\u201d method (which \u201cPotan Mitan\u201d advocated) that goes through four stages: art, craft, technicality, and science.\n\n\u201cThe use by an artist of sensitive media: earth, clay, ceramics, paper and all disciplines of art is a source of enrichment and can push his creative sense,\u201d he told the newspaper.\n\nIn short\n\nWith his captivating, deep, and rebellious style, he has made his mark on the postmodern art scene. His art has given soul to the Spring \u2013 2012 collection (inspired by the painter\u2019s black and white inks) of American fashion designer Donna Karan. The two will collaborate to launch a project to develop Haitian handicrafts to bring them to an international level.\n\nIn collaboration with Mich\u00e8le Frish and Roger Jaar, he created the company \u201cJivan\u201d for the collection of jewelry inspired by Haitian culture. In 1980, he received a Rotary International Foundation grant, which allowed him to continue his work.\n\nPhilippe Dodard has certainly accomplished more than many of his contemporaries. A proven entrepreneur, his worth is now estimated at over $102 million.\n\nConsidered an ace of Haitian painting, Philipe Dodard knew how to mark his time. He is one of the few entrepreneurs to have reached this level in the Haitian artistic field."}, {"url": "https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/100125-haiti-earthquake-voodoo-pat-robertson-pact-devil-wade-davis", "page_content": "Anthropologist and National Geographic explorer-in-residence* Wade Davis is the author of The Serpent and the Rainbow and Passage of Darkness, books that explore Haitian voodoo, magic, and zombies.\n\nDavis recently spoke with National Geographic News about how voodooists might view the recent Haiti earthquake, the concern many Haitians are feeling as they bury loved ones without proper rituals, and U.S. televangelist Pat Robertson's remark that Haiti's earthquake is God's retribution for a voodoo \"pact with the devil.\"\n\n(See \"Haiti Earthquake Pictures: Aerial Views of the Damage.\")\n\nNote: Davis's views are not necessarily those of National Geographic News.\n\nWhat is Haitian voodoo?\n\nVoodoo is a religion, a complex spiritual worldview, the distillation of profound religious ideas that came over from Africa during the slavery era and through time became manifest in any number of traditions in the New World.\n\nIt is ... a fusion of a number of religious traditions, of which Catholicism is one influence. Haitian culture and religion was inspired by virtually all of Africa from Senegal to Mozambique.\n\nWhat do voodoo followers believe in?\n\nVoodoo is based on a dynamic relationship between the living and the spirit realm.\n\nThe living give birth to the dead; the dead become the spirits; the spirits are the multiple expressions of the divine.\n\nA human being has both a physical body and a soul or spirit, and at death the two dissociate. The spirit of the individual slips away and must be ritually reclaimed by a priest in a ceremony at a certain time after death, usually a year and a day in Haiti.\n\nThe spirit initially associated with a particular relative, a father or grandfather or whatever, in time becomes reclaimed and is placed into a vessel, which is placed into the inner sanctuary of a temple.\n\nIn time the vessel becomes part of a vast ancestral pool of energy, and out of that pool emerges the archetypes of the spirits of the voodoo pantheon, which are seen as multiple expressions of the greater god.\n\nIn ritual these spirits, or lwa, can be summoned. Responding to the power of prayer, they momentarily displace the soul of the living such that human being and God become one and the same. This is spirit possession, the moment of divine grace.\n\nAs Haitians often told me, we go to church and speak about God; the voodooist dances in the temple and becomes God.\n\nAn analogy might be your grandmother's soul going to heaven and then coming back as an angel that both helps you and inhabits you.\n\nWhat do you think of Pat Robertson's recent remarks that this month's earthquake in Haiti was God's revenge for a pact Haitian slaves made with the devil to overthrow French colonists in the late 1700s?\n\nCruel, ignorant, unforgivable, the ravings of a lunatic. He doesn't even know what he's talking about.\n\nWhat happened\u2014according to both historical record and the founding history for the Haitian state\u2014was that there was a voodoo ceremony where the symbol of freedom sang out, which was the sound of the conch trumpet [spurring African slaves to rebel against French coffee and sugar plantation owners in 1791].\n\nIn the same way that we speak so reverentially of Washington crossing the Delaware, that was the catalyst of the slave revolt. It was the only successful slave revolt in history [to have won control of a country], and it's said to have begun with a voodoo ceremony.\n\nSo Pat Robertson is saying by that comment that voodoo itself is the devil. Voodoo is not a black magic cult, nor does it have anything to do with a Christian notion of the devil.\n\nAll he's saying by that comment is that all African religion is devil worship, and he's revealing not only his ignorance about what voodoo really is, but also his bias that any religion not his own is devil worship.\n\nFor a man who aspired to the presidency he revealed himself to be remarkably unschooled in American history.\n\nHad it not been for the revolutionary slaves of Haiti, we might well be speaking French in much of what is today the U.S.A.\n\nNapoleon at the height of his power dispatched the greatest military force ever to sail from France. Its mission was twofold: Crush the slave revolt in Haiti, and then proceed up the Mississippi, hem in the expanding 13 Colonies, and reestablish French dominance in a continent that only 30 years before at the Treaty of Paris had become British North America.\n\nThanks to the Haitian patriots, the French armada never reached New Orleans [and Napoleon decided to sell much of what is now the western U.S. via the Louisiana Purchase.]\n\nBut it's not just televangelists who have a dark impression of Haitian voodoo. Why is that?\n\nThe thing about African religion is that it's very dynamic and astonishing. To see someone possessed by the spirit and actually become a god and handle burning coal with impunity and cut into the skin and so on\u2014your reaction is either fear or disbelief for those of us who don't know our god in this direct way.\n\nThere's no question that in African religion there are very theatrical displays of faith.\n\nThe reason you cut yourself or handle burning embers is to show that a person taken over by the god is a god and can't be harmed.\n\nThere are things like animal sacrifice that we get very upset about. Well, actually what's going on there is\u2014as in many religious traditions\u2014a sense that disease or misfortune must be addressed by reestablishing energetic equilibrium. So you make an offering, and that offering is something precious to you, whether it be human blood or animal blood.\n\nAlso, in the 1920s, the U.S. Marine Corps occupied Haiti. This was during the era of segregation, and most of the U.S. Marine Corps in Haiti were Southerners. Afterward, every one of them seemed to get a book contract, and ... they were all filled with pins and needles and zombies that don't exist. They gave rise to the Hollywood movies ... such as Night of the Living Dead and Zombies on Broadway and so on.\n\nDoes the Haiti earthquake look any different through the prism of voodoo?\n\nIn traditional African belief, no event has a life of its own. Everything is connected in a flow of causal association.\n\nMany Haitians in their agony and sorrow will be asking deep and anguished questions: Why now? Why us? What more can a tormented nation and a people be expected to bear?\n\nI think all cultures would respond in such a way to such an unimaginable and unprecedented cataclysm. After 9/11 we all [in the U.S.] asked, Why do they hate us? Which in a sense was another way of asking, Why did this happen?\n\nIs voodoo a potential source of consolation to Haiti's earthquake victims?\n\nFor all its challenges, Haiti remains a place of extraordinary human resourcefulness, a land where people having so little have found a way to adorn their lives with the imagination. Culturally it is arguably the most vibrant and extraordinary country in the Americas.\n\nIn a time of tragedy and pain, the Haitian people, like people everywhere, will find comfort in faith, be it Christianity or the traditional religion of voodoo.\n\nAll people in all cultures honor the dead, and the fact that the sheer scale of the disaster has precluded the possibility of proper ritual burials will be a source of concern and sadness to all Haitians.\n\nPerhaps in time some of this grief may be released in a ceremony of national remembrance that will honor all who have been lost.\n\nFor now the rest of us, the entire global community, must do everything we can to support the living and facilitate the rebirth of a nation that has given so much to the world.\n\nMore on the 2010 Haiti Earthquake\n\nMore on Earthquakes\n\n\n\nNote: This interview has been condensed and edited.\n\n*The National Geographic Society owns National Geographic News."}, {"url": "https://guides.library.harvard.edu/folk_and_myth", "page_content": "What is folklore?\n\n\n\nNarrowly, the term \u201cfolklore\u201d has been traditionally considered the oral tales of a society. More broadly, the term refers to all aspects of a culture \u2013 beliefs, traditions, norms, behaviors, language, literature, jokes, music, art, foodways, tools, objects, etc.\n\n\n\nFolklore is, in essence, anything and everything in life.\n\n\n\nWhat is Folklore Studies?\n\n\n\nFolklore Studies, also known as Folkloristics, is the study of all aspects of culture, particularly material culture or the products of a society. It developed as a discipline in the nineteenth-century in tandem with a number of other disciplines, including Literary Studies, History, Anthropology, Sociology, and Psychology; and has followed similar theoretical trends.\n\nIn the early 19th century, with the nostalgic wistfulness of the Romantic movement and burgeoning nationalism in Europe and North America, scholars grew increasingly interested in collecting and cataloging material culture, particularly folklore. This time period produced a large number of folklore and fairytale collections and preserved a portion of oral culture. The term \u201cfolklore\u201d was first used in 1846 by William Thoms. Originally, it was limited solely to oral peasant tales. It was not until the 20th century that Folklore Studies was recognized as both cultural studies and as a discipline.\n\nWhy study folklore?\n\nFolklore helps us understand society, cultures, communities, groups, and individuals. Studying folklore develops analytical skills and cultural sensitivity. Most importantly, it engenders understanding of and respect for others, as well as better understanding of ourselves.\n\nFolklorists are rarely ever just folklorists. A degree in Folklore Studies teaches a range of transferable skills which can be used in any career. Some folklorists continue in academia as teachers and researchers, often in literature, history, or anthropology departments. Most folklorists apply their cultural knowledge and analytical skills to the public field and work as mediators between institutions and society. Many folklorists work directly with communities in a variety of ways, such as:\n\nEducators\n\nEthnographers\n\nResearchers\n\nAnthropologists\n\nWriters\n\nEditors\n\nCurators\n\nLibrarians\n\nConservators\n\nDoctors\n\nSocial Workers\n\nLawyers\n\nSocial Activists\n\nEntrepreneurs\n\nFilm Producers\n\nJournalists\n\nNon-Profit Organizers\n\nImage: American School.

Ancestors\u2019 Day is a national holiday, celebrated on January second, the day after the celebration of Independence Day on January first. Folktales are popular in Haiti. Stories are introduced by an invitation to hear a story. For instance, the person wanting to tell the story shouts out: \u201cKrik!\u201d If people want to hear the tale, and they almost always do, they answer in chorus: \u201cKrak!\u201d The most popular folktales are about the smart but mischievous Ti Malis and his slow-witted friend Bouki . Here is one example:\n\nTi Malis paid Bouki a visit one day. To his amazement, when he got to Bouki\u2019s lakou (yard), there was Bouki playing dominoes with his dog. \u201cWhat a brilliant dog you have!\u201d exclaimed Ti Malis. \u201cHe can play dominoes.\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d said Bouki, \u201che\u2019s not as smart as you think.

It is not found commonly anymore. The lwa/loa, or spirits with whom Vodouisants work and practice, are not gods but servants of Bon Dye (pronounced Bon Dieu), an omnipotent and divine being far beyond the scope of human understanding. In keeping with the French-Catholic influence of the faith, Vodouisants are for the most part monotheists, believing that the loa are great and powerful forces in the world with whom humans interact and vice versa, resulting in a symbiotic relationship intended to bring both us and the loa back to Bon Dye. \u201cVoodoo is a religious practice, a faith that points toward an intimate knowledge of God, and offers its practitioners a means to come into communion with the Divine, through an ever evolving paradigm of dance, song and prayers.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://visithaiti.com/haiti-up-close/haitian-cultural-traditions/", "page_content": "Any true Haitian knows that the exclamation \"krik?\" always proceeds with an excellent \"krak,\" or story, as telling tales is an integral part of Haiti's cultural traditions.

Although generally written down by somebody, (Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm wrote most of the well-known fairy tales), they are often based on traditional stories or folklore. They contain elements of truth and usually a moral message. They also generally have a happy ending. (The baddies tend to get what they deserve!)\n\nArtist Joan Jonas is fascinated by myths and legends. Her installation The Juniper Tree is inspired by a story by Brothers Grimm. But she doesn\u2019t depict scenes from the story:\n\nWhen I started using stories with The Juniper Tree, which is a Grimm Brothers story, there was a continuous voice telling the story and I worked against it. I don\u2019t illustrate the stories, but I represent and react to them \u2013 find ways to make my own language in relation to the story.\n\nJoan Jonas\n\nProps, relics, video projections, paintings and drawings are included in the installation, as well as garments and constructions used in the last version of the performance.\n\nPaula Rego is fascinated by folk tales and fairy tales and often references Portuguese stories and folklore in her work. She also made a series of prints based on stories surrounding the Pendle Witches, as well as a series of paintings based on Portuguese fairy tales.\n\nMyths and legends from around the world\n\nPaul Gauguin\n\nFaa Iheihe (1898)\n\nTate\n\nFrench post-impressionist artist Paul Gauguin moved from France to Tahiti in 1895. He wanted to escape modern life in Europe and live in what he thought would be a simpler culture. As well as being inspired by the landscape and way of life, he often included gods and stories from Polynesian mythology in his paintings.\n\nArtist Marc Chagall uses mythology and Russian folklore as the subject for many of his colourful, dreamlike artworks.\n\nParviz Tanavoli developed a visual language that drew on Iranian traditional culture and its symbols. In a series of screenprints he celebrates Persian myths. He combines motifs and icons found in folk art, such as the cage, the lion, the lock and the bird, with geometric abstract forms.\n\nLegends don\u2019t have to be ancient. Artist Sidney Nolan created a series of paintings and prints around the stories associated with the Australian outlaw and folk hero Ned Kelly. Kelly was the leader of a gang of bank robbers who, like Robin Hood, often gave money to the poor. His daring adventures became the stuff of legends. The strange square helmet that Kelly is wears in Nolan\u2019s paintings, references the home-made metal body armour worn by the gang.\n\nOp artist Bridget Riley\u2019s abstract paintings were often inspired by her experience of different cultures as she travelled around the world. Nataraja is a term from Hindu mythology meaning \u2018Lord of the Dance\u2019. It refers to the Hindu God Shiva in his form as the cosmic dancer, who is usually depicted with many arms. In her painting Nataraja, vertical bands of colour are cut across by diagonals, creating a sense of dynamic movement and suggesting the rhythm of the dance. Myth making\n\nWilliam Blake\n\nThe Ghost of a Flea (c.1819\u201320)\n\nTate William Blake\n\nNebuchadnezzar (1795\u2013c.1805)\n\nTate\n\nArtist and poet William Blake created his own mythology populated by a host of beings that he himself had either invented, or re-interpreted. In his book Jerusalem, Blake wrote:\n\nI must create a system, or be enslav'd by another man's. I will not reason & compare: my business is to create.\n\nSo while other poets and artists used characters from Greek and Roman mythology, Blake created his own.\n\nInspired by legend and folklore, artist Alan Davie developed a language of symbols, shapes and signs. He used these to create abstract artworks that seem to refer to mysterious and mystical other worlds.\n\nMore than myths Legends, myths and folk tales are usually a combination of fact and fantasy. They often include or refer to real people and events. Artists Ellen Gallagher and Anselm Kiefer have used legends in their work to explore and comment on significant and horrific events in history.\n\nBird in Hand reflects Ellen Gallagher\u2019s interest in narratives surrounding the slave trade. In several artworks Gallagher has imaginatively explored of the Middle Passage. This was the most treacherous part of the slave-trading route between Africa and North America. Bird in Hand shows an underwater scene that seems to refer to the mythical Drexciya or Black Atlantis. This is a fictional underwater world populated by a marine species descended from drowned slaves. The central figure in the painting is a sailor or pirate with a peg-leg. His character is mysterious, but Gallagher suggests that he is an evil presence:\n\nI think of this painting as an origin myth of sorts, with a kind of evil doctor, perhaps related to Doctor Moreau or Frankenstein, at its centre.\n\nAnselm Kiefer uses Germanic mythology to explore Germany\u2019s troubled past. This is one of a series of painting Kiefer made between 1980 and 1983 that revisited images of Hitler\u2019s monumental architecture. Using old photographs and architectural plans, Kiefer transformed symbols of Nazi authority into derelict building-sites. In this work, the vaulted structure contains the unseen presence of three figures from Norse mythology (The Norns) who represent Past, Present and Future. Their names are scratched into the ceiling. These \u2018fates\u2019 are traditionally represented in a hall, spinning the threads of destiny. In this painting their presence is suggested by the thread-like strings that hang from their names. Below a glowing fire suggests Kiefer\u2019s hope for salvation and regeneration. The work reflects Kiefer\u2019s attempts to reconcile his country\u2019s history through the myths of Germanic legend.\n\nObjects: spiritual and ritualistic\n\nAs well as depicting myths and legends, artists often use ritualistic objects to suggest them.\n\nArtist Joseph Beuys created his own personal mythology. He was a pilot during the Second World War and was shot down over the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine. From this incident Beuys developed the myth that a nomadic tribe had rescued him. He would have died if they hadn\u2019t wrapped his broken body in fat and felt (to keep him warm) and nursed him back to health. Beuys often used fat and felt in his work. These humble substances became powerful symbols of healing and life.\n\nThe rich pigments used by sculptor Anish Kapoor give his sculptural forms a feeling of ritual or ceremony. He was inspired by the use of pigment in Hindu ceremonies. The title As if to Celebrate, I discovered a Mountain Blooming With Red Flowers relates to the Hindu myth of the Goddess, who was born out of a fiery mountain. The mountain was composed of the bodies of male gods. Kapoor was interested in this idea of one force giving way to or being transformed into the energy and substance of another.\n\nHave a go!\n\nRe-mastering mythology\n\nFrank Auerbach used Titian\u2019s painting of Bacchus and Ariadne as a starting point for a an abstract painting.

The Haitian culture is unique and rich in history.\n\nIntroduction to Haitian Culture\n\nThe Haitian culture is one of the most diverse cultures in the world. The culture of Haiti is a mix of African, French, and Spanish influences. The people are proud and passionate about their culture, reflected in their music, art, and cuisine. Haitian culture is known for its voodoo religion, colorful clothing, and lively festivals.\n\nThe Haitian culture is known for its vibrant religious practices, colorful clothing, and lively festivals. Vodou\u2019s most popular religion in Haiti is a spiritual world that intersects with the physical world. Haitians celebrate various holidays, including independence day, Mardi Gras, ash Wednesday, and Carnival to name a few.\n\nHaiti is the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and was devastated by a 2010 earthquake that killed over 200,000 people. Despite these challenges, Haitians are resilient people with a strong sense of community and culture.\n\nHaiti\u2019s Regional Relationships\n\nHaiti is located in the Caribbean region and has strong relationships with its neighbors. The country is a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), the Organization of American States (OAS), and the Association of Caribbean States (ACS). Haiti also has close ties to France, the United States, and Canada.\n\nHaiti occupies the western part of the Antilles and has regional relationships with several countries in the area. These include the Dominican Republic, Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. Haiti also has close ties to the United States, France, and Canada.\n\nHaitian People\n\nThe people from Haiti are Haitians. Most of the population is of African descent, while a small percentage is of European descent. Haiti is predominately Catholic, although there is a sizable Protestant population.\n\nHaiti is one of the most ethnically diverse countries globally, with many distinct ethnic groups living within its borders. Kreyol, the most spoken language of Haiti, is a mixture of French, African, and Caribbean languages.\n\nOver 90 percent of the population share an identity with this common African lineage. This bondage is evident in its cultural traditions, heavily influenced by its African heritage. The vibrant music, dance, and art characterize the culture. The island is also known for its delicious food. Haitian food is from west African slaves\u2019 cuisine.\n\nA little bit of Haitian History\n\nHaiti Won Independence From France In 1804, Making It The Second Country In The Americas? Haiti is in the Caribbean region. Its border countries are the Dominican Republic and Cuba to the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the north.\n\nThe first inhabitants of Haiti were the Taino, Arawak, the Caribs, and the French. Haiti gained its independence from France in 1804, making it one of the first countries in the Americas to gain its independence from a European power.\n\nThe French Influence\n\nThe French Influence on Haitian Culture has been significant and pervasive. The French were the 2nd Europeans to arrive in Haiti, and they quickly began to mold the culture in their image during the colonization.\n\nYou can easily see this influence in the language, the architecture, and the food. French was the language of Haiti until recently when Kreyol became the 2nd language of Haiti.\n\nFrench architecture is still evident in Haiti, especially in the capital city of Port-au-Prince. Haitian food is also heavily influenced by the French.\n\nThe Spanish influence on Haitian\n\nThe Spanish influence on Haitian is not just limited to words. It also includes adopting new agricultural practices, introducing fresh foods, and spreading Christianity.\n\nCreole is a French-based language with heavy influences from Spanish. Spanish has heavily influenced the language because Spain colonized Haiti for over three centuries (1492-1806).\n\nThe African Influence on Haitian\n\nThe Caribbean region is known for its rich and diverse culture. Haiti, in particular, has a unique and complex history that has left a lasting imprint on its society. However, many aspects of Haitian culture may not be immediately apparent to the casual observer. One such aspect is the influence of Africa on the Haitian community.\n\nAfricans and Haitians have a long and complicated history. The Haitian Revolution led to the end of slavery in Haiti. Europeans living in Haiti enslaved Africans, which is how they came into contact with the French language.\n\nThe enslaved Africans\u2019 Influence on Haitian is a topic that many scholars have studied. Professor John McAlister did one of the more recent studies on this topic. His study, \u201cAfrican Influences on Haitian Creole,\u201d examined the influence of African languages and cultures on the development of the language.\n\nHe found that while some words were from European languages, some were from African languages. He also found that some grammatical structures in Kreyol are similar to those in African languages. For example, there are no articles in this language because they are not necessary for understanding what someone is saying.\n\nHaiti languages\n\nHaiti is one of the only countries in the world that has two official languages. Kreyol, which is spoken by 90% of Haitians, is the native language. It was born on the island of Hispaniola in the 17th century, and it has evolved to become a distinct language with its grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.\n\nThis language has mixed influences from African languages and French and Spanish words introduced by Europeans who colonized Haiti in 1697. Enslaved Africans on sugarcane plantations developed the local language.\n\nThe French language was introduced to Haiti by colonizers in 1697 and became a formal language after independence from France in 1804.\n\nHaiti is a predominantly Roman Catholic country, and the state religion is Roman Catholicism.\n\nHaitian Religion\n\nRoman Catholicism is the official religion of Haiti. Voodoo is also considered a national religion. Haiti is a predominately Roman Catholic country. Catholicism is the official religion of Haiti. Voodoo, a national religion, is also popular in Haiti.\n\nVodou is a religion that originated in the Caribbean and is also popular in Haiti. It is a polytheistic belief system that revolves around the worship of spirits. Vodou ceremonies involve plants, animals, and other objects to cast spells. Haitians believe that voodoo can help them cure illnesses and bring good luck.\n\nHaitian Art\n\nThe Haitian art tradition is complex, with African roots. The art of Haiti is known for its vibrant colors and intricate designs. Art is often reflective of the country\u2019s history and culture.\n\nThe art is typically colorful and features vibrant depictions of the country\u2019s natural landscapes and people. The artists frequently use traditional methods, such as wood carving, to create their pieces.\n\nHaitian Music\n\nHaitian music is a unique blend of African rhythms and melodies with European instruments. French occupation and the Spanish occupation influenced the music of Haiti. Haiti\u2019s neighbors in Latin America and the Caribbean also played a role in it.\n\nMusic is part of its culture, and you can feel it in its instruments, dances, and songs. They use drums like b\u00e8l\u00e8 drums to create a steady beat for their dances and songs.\n\nThe most popular dance in Haiti is the meringue, originally from Martinique but then spread to Haiti during the slavery period. It can be heard everywhere, from the streets to homes to parties. Haitians are known for their love for music and dance.\n\nThey enjoy parties that last for hours with dancing that never seems to stop. The music of Haiti is a mix of styles from many people who have settled on the island. Haitian popular music is known for its lively rhythms, syncopation, and polyrhythms.\n\nThe most popular type of music in Haiti is kompa. Kompa copies its drumming style from that of African drumming. Kompa is often danced to and is a popular form of entertainment in Haiti.\n\nHaitian folklore and mythology\n\nMany Haitians believe in superstitions, which date back to their ancestors. For example, many Haitians believe that if a person crosses their path while walking in the dark, they will fall and die. Additionally, they believe that a spirit will come and take it away if a person leaves food out on the table after dinner.\n\nHaitian folklore and mythology are rich with death, love, and redemption stories. These stories provide a glimpse into the rich culture and spirituality of Haiti. The story of the Haitian Mermaid for example is a story that many Haitians believe in.\n\nHaiti has a long history of oral tradition, including stories, songs, and dance. Haitians have a rich oral tradition of myths, legends, folktales, proverbs, and sayings. These are often passed down from generation to generation through storytelling.\n\nHaitian Cuisine\n\nHaitian cuisine consists of cooking traditions and practices from Haiti. Haitian cuisine comes from the three dominant cultures in Haiti: French, Creole, and African. Haitian dishes such as griot shows this multicultural influence.\n\nHaitian cuisine is a fusion of the many different cooking traditions and practices. Some of the most popular Haitian dishes include Rice and beans, Griot, Soupe Joumou, and Haitian-style red beans and rice. Haitian cuisine is often spicy and flavorful. Rice, beans, and green plantains are the staples of Haitian cuisines.\n\nHaiti political instability\n\nThe Haitian political instability results from the country\u2019s history of turmoil and instability. Haiti has been ruled by various dictators and military regimes for over 200 years, making it one of the most unstable countries in the Western Hemisphere. The recent history of political violence and natural disasters has only worsened after the Duvalier era.\n\nSince the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, the instability and lack of infrastructure has made daily life unbearable for the citizens. The lack of security, health, school, clean water, and reliable electricity has made life a daily struggle for many Haitians. Due to that, Haiti\u2019s economy has also hit, making it difficult for people to find work or access necessities.\n\nThe Haitian Culture Relationships\n\nThe people of Haiti are known for their joyous and lively personalities and their strong family ties. Haitian culture is also known for its strong religious beliefs and traditional practices.\n\nHaitian culture is a copycat of the African culture, and the people of Haiti have a rich culture and history that is unique to them.\n\nThe reputation of a family in Haiti is significant. The actions of their members typically judge families. It is generally essential to have a strong family reputation in Haiti, and people will often look to family members for guidance and advice.\n\nCommon Haitian Values and traditions\n\nSince many Haitians live in rural areas and Haiti is considered one of the poorest nations in the world, traditional and communal values take center stage. The country\u2019s median age is 24, which shapes some cultural beliefs.\n\nTheir friendly and expressive nature characterizes the hospitality of Haitians. Their obedience to elders, their respect for family, and their embrace of Haitian culture are proof of that. Haitians also work together to create a warm and welcoming environment.\n\nGeneral Haitian Family Structure and Values\n\nThe Haitian culture is all about traditions and values passed down from generation to generation. Haitian couples usually play different roles in society, and decisions are typically made based on the advice of family members. Haitian families are very close-knit, and they support one another through thick and thin.\n\nThe traditional family structure in Haiti dictates that the men typically are the breadwinners and the head of the household, while the women are responsible for making decisions regarding the family. Like many other societies, Haiti has a big fight for equality between men and women.\n\nHaitians often live in extended families, with grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins all living together. Haitian parents are very strict and expect their Haitian children to obey them. In general, Haitians have strong family values and respect their elders.\n\nThe Haitian culture is known for its beautiful and well-behaved Haitian women. The women of Haiti are some of the most beautiful in the world. The latter is partly because Haiti has a rich history and culture and because the women of Haiti are taught from a young age to be proud and confident.\n\nFAQ: Frequently asked questions about Haiti\n\nWhere is Haiti on the map\n\nHaiti is located in the Caribbean Sea, southeast of Cuba. It is the smallest country in the Western Hemisphere and has an area of just over 10,000 square miles. The country\u2019s population is estimated at 10 million. The capital is Port-au-Prince. Haiti occupies the western third of the Caribbean.\n\nWhat is the population of Haiti?\n\nThe last time I checked, the population of Haiti was approximately 12.5 million people. The majority of Haitians live in the southern and western regions of the country. The population is multiplying as more Haitians are moving to the country searching for opportunities.\n\nWhat language do Haitians speak?\n\nHaitian Creole and French are the two most spoken languages. Most Haitians speak the local language, but French is also widespread because of its history with France.\n\nFrench was introduced to Haiti by the French Empire and has been the country\u2019s official language since 1804. A consequence of this has been that Haitians can either speak Haitian Creole or French, but not both fluently.\n\nWhat are Haitians best known for?\n\nHaitians are best known for their deep culture, rich heritage, and natural environment.\n\nWhat do Haitian celebrate?\n\nThe Haitian culture is rich in tradition and festivals. They celebrate many events with music, dancing, food, and drinks throughout the year.\n\nThe Haitian New Year celebration is on January 1st. But they also celebrate Christmas Eve on December 24th. Another popular event is Carnival in late February or early March. It is this time of the year that many Haitians dance to music such as rara which is part of the Haitian culture.\n\nWhy is Haiti so poor?\n\nHaiti is one of the poorest countries in the world. Most Haitians are struggling to survive. In the early 19th century, Haiti was one of the most prosperous countries in the world. However, over time it has become a very poor country. One reason for this is that Haiti is a highly unequal society. Haiti has a very high level of poverty and inequality. Because of that, life expectancy is very low in Haiti ask compared to other nations in the region. The infant mortality rate is very high. Children may go days without having more than 2 meals a day.\n\nAnother reason why Haiti is so poor is corruption. The justice system in Haiti is one of the weakest in the globe. Impunity has led to widespread corruption in Haiti, as people use their positions to get rich. I am not making this up, but many people claim that 99.99% of leaders in Haiti are corrupt.\n\nThe Haitian culture is fascinating and full of surprises. I hope you have enjoyed this brief overview."}, {"url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/in-haiti-the-art-of-resilience-53519464/", "page_content": "Six weeks had passed since a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti, killing 230,000 people and leaving more than 1.5 million others homeless. But the ground was still shaking in the nation\u2019s rubble-strewn capital, Port-au-Prince, and 87-year-old Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut wasn\u2019t taking any chances. One of the most prominent Haitian artists of the past 50 years was sleeping in a crude tent made of plastic sheeting and salvaged wood, fearful his earthquake-damaged house would collapse at any moment.\n\n\u201cDid you feel the tremors last night?\u201d Duffaut asked.\n\nYes, I had felt the ground shake in my hotel room around 4:30 that morning. It was the second straight night of tremors, and I was feeling a bit stressed. But standing next to Duffaut, whose fantastical naive paintings I have admired for three decades, I resolved to put my anxieties on hold.\n\nIt was Duffaut, after all, who had lived through one of the most horrific natural disasters of modern times. Not only was he homeless in the poorest nation of the Western Hemisphere, his niece and nephew had died in the earthquake. Gone, too, were his next-door neighbors in Port-au-Prince. \u201cTheir house just completely collapsed,\u201d Duffaut said. \u201cNine people were inside.\u201d\n\nThe diabolical 15- to 20-second earthquake on January 12 also stole a sizable chunk of Duffaut\u2019s\u2014and Haiti\u2019s\u2014artistic legacy. At least three artists, two gallery owners and an arts foundation director died. Thousands of paintings and sculptures\u2014valued in the tens of millions of dollars\u2014were destroyed or badly damaged in museums, galleries, collectors\u2019 homes, government ministries and the National Palace. The celebrated biblical murals that Duffaut and other Haitian artists painted at Holy Trinity Cathedral in the early 1950s were now mostly rubble. The Haitian Art Museum at College St. Pierre, run by the Episcopal Church, was badly cracked. And the beloved Centre d\u2019Art, the 66-year-old gallery and school that jump-started Haiti\u2019s primitive art movement\u2014making collectors out of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Bill and Hillary Clinton, the filmmaker Jonathan Demme and thousands of others\u2014had crumbled. \u201cThe Centre d\u2019Art is where I sold my first piece of art in the 1940s,\u201d Duffaut said quietly, tugging on the white beard he had grown since the earthquake.\n\nDuffaut disappeared from his tent and returned a few moments later with a painting that displayed one of his trademark imaginary villages, a rural landscape dominated by winding, gravity-defying mountain roads filled with tiny people, houses and churches. Then he retrieved another painting. And another. Suddenly, I was surrounded by six Duffauts\u2014and all were for sale.\n\nStanding beside his tent, which was covered by a tarpaulin stamped USAID, Duffaut flashed a satisfied grin.\n\n\u201cHow much?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cFour thousand dollars [each],\u201d he said, suggesting the price local galleries would charge.\n\nNot having more than $50 in my pocket, I had to pass. But I was delighted that Pr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut was open for business. \u201cMy future paintings will be inspired by this terrible tragedy,\u201d he told me. \u201cWhat I have seen on the streets has given me a lot of ideas and added a lot to my imagination.\u201d There was an unmistakable look of hope in the old master\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cDeye mon, gen mon,\u201d a Haitian proverb, is Creole for \u201cbeyond the mountains, more mountains.\u201d\n\nImpossibly poor, surviving on less than $2 a day, most Haitians have made it their life\u2019s work to climb over, under and around obstacles, be they killer hurricanes, food riots, endemic diseases, corrupt governments or the ghastly violence that appears whenever there is political upheaval. One victim of these all too frequent calamities has been Haitian culture: even before the earthquake, this French- and Creole-speaking Caribbean island nation of nearly ten million people did not have a publicly owned art museum or even a single movie theater.\n\nStill, Haitian artists have proved astonishingly resilient, continuing to create, sell and survive through crisis after crisis. \u201cThe artists here have a different temperament,\u201d Georges Nader Jr. told me in his fortress-like gallery in P\u00e9tionville, the once-affluent, hillside Port-au-Prince suburb. \u201cWhen something bad happens, their imagination just seems to get better.\u201d Nader\u2019s family has been selling Haitian art since the 1960s.\n\nThe notion of making a living by creating and selling art first came to Haiti in the 1940s, when an American watercolorist named DeWitt Peters moved to Port-au-Prince. Peters, a conscientious objector to the world war then underway, took a job teaching English and was struck by the raw artistic expression he found at every turn\u2014even on the local buses known as tap-taps.\n\nHe founded Centre d\u2019Art in 1944 to organize and promote untrained artists, and within a few years, word had gone out that something special was happening in Haiti. During a visit to the center in 1945, Andr\u00e9 Breton, the French writer, poet and a leader of the cultural movement known as Surrealism, swooned over the work of a self-described houngan (voodoo priest) and womanizer named Hector Hyppolite, who often painted with chicken feathers. Hyppolite\u2019s creations, on subjects ranging from still lifes to voodoo spirits to scantily clad women (presumed to be his mistresses), sold for a few dollars each. But, Breton wrote, \u201call carried the stamp of total authenticity.\u201d Hyppolite died of a heart attack in 1948, three years after joining Centre d\u2019Art and one year after his work was displayed at a triumphant (for Haiti as well as for him) United Nations-sponsored exhibition in Paris.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Haitian art market relied largely on the tourists who ventured to this Maryland-size nation, 700 or so miles from Miami, to savor its heady m\u00e9lange of naive art, Creole food, smooth dark rum, hypnotic (though, at times, staged) voodoo ceremonies, high-energy carnivals and riotously colored bougainvillea. (Is it any wonder Haitian artists never lacked for inspiration?)\n\nThough tourists largely shied away from Haiti in the 1960s, when self-declared president-for-life Fran\u00e7ois \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier ruled through terror enforced by his personal army of Tonton Macoutes, they returned after his death in 1971, when his playboy son, Jean-Claude (known as \u201cBaby Doc\u201d), took charge.\n\nI got my first glimpse of Haitian art when I interviewed Baby Doc in 1977. (His reign as president-for-life ended abruptly when he fled the country in 1986 for France, where he lives today at age 59 in Paris.) I was hooked the moment I bought my first painting, a $10 market scene done on a flour sack. And I was delighted that every painting, iron sculpture and sequined voodoo flag I carried home on subsequent trips gave me further insight into a culture that is a blend of West African, European, native Ta\u00edno and other homegrown influences.\n\nAlthough some nicely done Haitian paintings could be bought for a few hundred dollars, the best works by early masters such as Hyppolite and Philom\u00e9 Obin (a devout Protestant who painted scenes from Haitian history, the Bible and his family\u2019s life) eventually commanded tens of thousands of dollars. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Hirshhorn in Washington, D.C. added Haitian primitives to their collections. And Haiti\u2019s reputation as a tourist destination was reinforced by the eclectic parade of notables\u2014from Barry Goldwater to Mick Jagger\u2014who checked into the Hotel Oloffson, the creaky gingerbread retreat that is the model for the hotel in The Comedians, Graham Greene\u2019s 1966 novel about Haiti.\n\nMuch of this exuberance faded in the early 1980s amid political strife and the dawn of the AIDS pandemic. U.S. officials classified Haitians as being among the four groups at highest risk for HIV infection. (The others were homosexuals, hemophiliacs and heroin addicts.) Some Haitian doctors called this designation unwarranted, even racist, but the perception stuck that a Haitian holiday was not worth the risk.\n\nThough tourism waned, the galleries that sponsored Haitian painters and sculptors targeted sales to overseas collectors and the increasing numbers of journalists, development workers, special envoys, physicians, U.N. peacekeepers and others who found themselves in the country.\n\n\u201cHaitians are not a brooding people,\u201d said gallery owner Toni Monnin, a Texan who moved to Haiti in the boom-time \u201970s and married a local art dealer. \u201cTheir attitude is: \u2018Let\u2019s get on with it! Tomorrow is another day.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the Gingerbread gallery in P\u00e9tionville, I was introduced to a 70-year-old sculptor who wore an expression of utter despondence. \u201cI have no home. I have no income. And there are days when me and my family don\u2019t eat,\u201d Nacius Joseph told me. Looking for financial support, or at least a few words of encouragement, he was visiting the galleries that had bought and sold his work over the years.\n\nJoseph told gallery owner Axelle Liautaud that his days as a woodcarver, creating figures such as La Sirene, the voodoo queen of the ocean, were over. \u201cAll my tools are broken,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t work. All of my apprentices, the people who helped me, have left Port-au-Prince, gone to the provinces. I\u2019m very discouraged. I have lost everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t you love what you\u2019re doing?\u201d Liautaud asked.\n\nJoseph nodded.\n\n\u201cThen you have to find a way to do it. This is a situation where you have to have some drive because everyone has problems.\u201d\n\nJoseph nodded again, but looked to be near tears.\n\nThough the gallery owners were themselves hurting, many were handing out money and art supplies to keep the artists employed.\n\nAt her gallery a few blocks away, Monnin told me that in the days following the quake she distributed $14,000 to more than 40 artists. \u201cRight after the earthquake, they simply needed money to buy food,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, 90 percent of the artists I work with lost their homes.\u201d\n\nJean-Emmanuel \u201cMannu\u201d El Saieh, whose late father, Issa, was one of the earliest promoters of Haitian art, was paying a young painter\u2019s medical bills. \u201cI just talked to him on the phone, and you don\u2019t have to be a doctor to know he\u2019s still suffering from shock,\u201d El Saieh said at his gallery, just up a rutted road from the Oloffson hotel, which survived the quake.\n\nThough most of the artists I encountered had become homeless, they did not consider themselves luckless. They were alive, after all, and aware that the tremblement de terre had killed many of their friends and colleagues, such as the octogenarian owners of the Rainbow Gallery, Carmel and Cavour Delatour; Raoul Mathieu, a painter; Destimare Pierre Marie Isnel (a.k.a. Louco), a sculptor who worked with discarded objects in the downtown Grand Rue slum; and Flores \u201cFlo\u201d McGarrell, an American artist and film director who in 2008 moved to Jacmel (a town with splendid French colonial architecture, some of which survived the quake) to head up a foundation that supported local artists.\n\nThe day I arrived in Port-au-Prince, I heard rumors of another possible casualty\u2014Alix Roy, a reclusive, 79-year-old painter who had been missing since January 12. I knew Roy\u2019s work well: he painted humorous scenes from Haitian life, often chubby kids dressed up as adults in elaborate costumes, some wearing oversize sunglasses, others balancing outrageously large fruits on their heads. Although he was a loner, Roy was an adventurous sort who had also lived in New York, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.\n\nA few nights later, Nader called my room at Le Plaza (one of the few hotels in the capital open for business) with some grim news. Not only had Roy died in the rubble of the gritty downtown hotel where he lived, his remains were still buried there, six weeks later. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find someone from the government to pick him up,\u201d Nader said. \u201cThat\u2019s the least the Haitian government can do for one of its best artists.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Nader introduced me to Roy\u2019s sister, a retired kindergarten director in P\u00e9tionville. Marl\u00e9ne Roy Etienne, 76, told me her older brother had rented a room on the top floor of the hotel so he could look down on the street for inspiration.\n\n\u201cI went to look for him after the earthquake but couldn\u2019t even find where the hotel had been because the entire street\u2014Rue des C\u00e9sars\u2014was rubble,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I stood in front of the rubble where I thought Alix might be and said a prayer.\u201d\n\nEtienne\u2019s eyes teared when Nader assured her he would continue pressing government officials to retrieve her brother\u2019s remains.\n\n\u201cThis is hard,\u201d she said, reaching for a handkerchief. \u201cThis is really hard.\u201d\n\nNader had been through some challenging times himself. Although he had not lost any family members, and his gallery in P\u00e9tionville was intact, the 32-room house where his parents lived, and where his father, Georges S. Nader, had built a gallery that contained perhaps the largest collection of Haitian art anywhere, had crumbled.\n\nThe son of Lebanese immigrants, the elder Nader was long considered one of Haiti\u2019s best-known and most successful art dealers, having established relationships with hundreds of artists since he opened a gallery downtown in 1966. He moved into the mansion in the hillside Croix-Desprez neighborhood a few years later and, in addition to the gallery, built a museum that showcased many of Haiti\u2019s finest artists, including Hyppolite, Obin, Rigaud Benoit and Castera Bazile. When he retired a few years ago, Nader turned over the gallery and museum to his son John.\n\nThe elder Nader had been taking a nap with his wife when the quake struck at 4:53 p.m. \u201cWe were rescued within ten minutes because our bedroom did not collapse,\u201d he told me. What Nader saw when he was led outside was horrifying. His collection had become a hideous pile of debris with thousands of paintings and sculptures buried under giant blocks of concrete.\n\n\u201cMy life\u2019s work is gone,\u201d Nader, 78, told me by telephone from his second home in Miami, where he has been living since the quake. Nader said he never bought insurance for his collection, which the family estimated to be worth more than $20 million.\n\nWith the rainy season approaching, Nader\u2019s sons hired a dozen men to pick, shovel and jackhammer their way through the debris, looking for anything that could be salvaged.\n\n\u201cWe had 12,000 to 15,000 paintings here,\u201d Georges Nader Jr. told me as we stomped through the sprawling heap, which reminded me of a bombed-out village from a World War II documentary. \u201cWe\u2019ve recovered about 3,000 paintings and about 1,800 of those are damaged. Some other paintings were taken by looters in the first days after the earthquake.\u201d\n\nBack at his gallery in P\u00e9tionville, Nader showed me a Hyppolite still life he had recovered. I recognized it, having admired the painting in 2009 at a retrospective at the Organization of American States\u2019 Art Museum of the Americas in Washington. But the 20- by 20-inch painting was now broken into eight pieces. \u201cThis will be restored by a professional,\u201d Nader said. \u201cWe have begun restoring the most important paintings we have recovered.\u201d\n\nI heard other echoes of cautious optimism as I visited cultural sites across Port-au-Prince. A subterranean, government-run historical museum that contained some important paintings and artifacts had survived. So did a private voodoo and Ta\u00edno museum in Mariani (near the quake\u2019s epicenter) and an ethnographic collection in P\u00e9tionville. People associated with the destroyed Holy Trinity Cathedral and Centre d\u2019Art, as well as the Episcopal Church\u2019s structurally feeble Haitian Art Museum, assured me that these institutions will be rebuilt. But no one could say how or when.\n\nThe United Nations has announced that 59 countries and international organizations have pledged $9.9 billion as \u201cthe down payment Haiti needs for wholesale national renewal.\u201d But there\u2019s no word on how much of that money, if any, will ever reach the cultural sector.\n\n\u201cWe deeply believe that Haitians living abroad can help us with the funds,\u201d said Henry Jolibois, an artist and architect who is a technical consultant to the Haitian prime minister\u2019s office. \u201cFor the rest, we must convince other entities in the world to participate, such as the museums and private collectors who have huge Haitian naive painting collections.\u201d\n\nAt the Holy Trinity Cathedral 14 murals had long offered a distinctively Haitian take on biblical events. My favorite was the Marriage at Cana by Wilson Bigaud, a painter who excelled at glimpses into everyday Haitian life\u2014cockfights, market vendors, baptismal parties, rara band parades. While some European artists portrayed the biblical event at which Christ turned water into wine as being rather formal, Bigaud\u2019s Cana was a decidedly casual affair with a pig, rooster and two Haitian drummers looking on. (Bigaud died this past March 22 at age 79.)\n\n\u201cThat Marriage at Cana mural was very controversial,\u201d Haiti\u2019s Episcopal bishop, Jean Zach\u00e9 Duracin, told me in his P\u00e9tionville office. \u201cIn the \u201940s and \u201950s many Episcopalians left the church in Haiti and became Methodists because they didn\u2019t want these murals at the cathedral. They said, \u2018Why? Why is there a pig in the painting?\u2019 They didn\u2019t understand there was a part of Haitian culture in these murals.\u201d\n\nDuracin told me it took him three days to gather the emotional strength to visit Holy Trinity. \u201cThis is a great loss, not only for the Episcopal church but for art worldwide,\u201d he said.\n\nVisiting the site myself one morning, I saw two murals that were more or less intact\u2014The Baptism of Our Lord by Castera Bazile and Philom\u00e9 Obin\u2019s Last Supper. (A third mural, Native Street Procession, by Duffaut, has survived, says former Smithsonian Institution conservator Stephanie Hornbeck, but others were destroyed.)\n\nAt the Haitian Art Museum, chunks of concrete had fallen on some of the 100 paintings on exhibit. I spotted one of Duffaut\u2019s oldest, largest and finest imaginary village paintings propped against a wall. A huge piece was missing from the bottom. A museum employee told me the piece had not been found. As I left, I reminded myself that although thousands of paintings had been destroyed in Haiti, thousands of others survived, and many are outside the country in private collections and institutions, including the Waterloo Center for the Arts in Iowa and the Milwaukee Art Museum, which have important collections of Haitian art. I also took comfort from conversations I had had with artists like Duffaut, who were already looking beyond the next mountain.\n\nNo one displays Haiti\u2019s artistic resolve more than Frantz Z\u00e9phirin, a gregarious 41-year-old painter, houngan and father of 12, whose imagination is as large as his girth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very lucky to be alive,\u201d Z\u00e9phirin told me late one afternoon in the Monnin gallery, where he was putting the finishing touches on his tenth painting since the quake. \u201cI was in a bar on the afternoon of the earthquake, having a beer. But I decided to leave the bar when people starting talking about politics. And I\u2019m glad I left. The earthquake came just one minute later, and 40 people died inside that bar.\u201d\n\nZ\u00e9phirin said he walked several hours, at times climbing over corpses, to get to his house. \u201cThat\u2019s where I learned that my stepmother and five of my cousins had died,\u201d he said. But his pregnant girlfriend was alive; so were his children.\n\n\u201cThat night, I decided I had to paint,\u201d Z\u00e9phirin said. \u201cSo I took my candle and went to my studio on the beach. I saw a lot of death on the way. I stayed up drinking beer and painting all night. I wanted to paint something for the next generation, so they can know just what I had seen.\u201d\n\nZ\u00e9phirin led me to the room in the gallery where his earthquake paintings were hung. One shows a rally by several fully clothed skeletons carrying a placard written in English: \u201cWe need shelters, clothes, condoms and more. Please help.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do more paintings like these,\u201d Z\u00e9phirin said. \u201cEach day 20 ideas for paintings pass in my head, but I don\u2019t have enough hands to make all of them.\u201d (Smithsonian commissioned the artist to create the painting that appears on the cover of this magazine. It depicts the devastated island nation with grave markers, bags of aid money and birds of mythic dimensions delivering flowers and gifts, such as \u201cjustice\u201d and \u201chealth.\u201d) In March, Z\u00e9phirin accepted an invitation to show his work in Germany. And two months later, he would head to Philadelphia for a one-man show, titled \u201cArt and Resilience,\u201d at the Indigo Arts Gallery.\n\nA few miles up a mountain road from P\u00e9tionville, one of Haiti\u2019s most celebrated contemporary artists, Philippe Dodard, was preparing to bring more than a dozen earthquake-inspired paintings to Arte Am\u00e9ricas, an annual fair in Miami Beach. Dodard showed me a rather chilling black-and-white acrylic that was inspired by the memory of a friend who perished in an office building. \u201cI\u2019m calling this painting Trapped in the Dark,\u201d he said.\n\nI have no idea how Dodard, a debonair man from Haiti\u2019s elite class whose paintings and sculptures confirm his passion for his country\u2019s voodoo and Ta\u00edno cultures, had found time to paint. He told me he had lost several friends and family members in the quake, as well as the headquarters of the foundation he helped create in the mid-1990s to promote culture among Haitian youth. And he was busily involved in a project to convert a fleet of school buses\u2014donated by the neighboring Dominican Republic\u2014into mobile classrooms for displaced students.\n\nLike Z\u00e9phirin, Dodard seemed determined to work through his grief with a paintbrush in hand. \u201cHow can I continue living after one of the biggest natural disasters in the history of the world? I can\u2019t,\u201d he wrote in the inscription that would appear next to his paintings at the Miami Beach show. \u201cInstead I use art to express the deep change that I see around and inside me.\u201d\n\nFor the Haitian art community, more hopeful news was on the way. In May, the Smithsonian Institution launched an effort to help restore damaged Haitian treasures. Led by Richard Kurin, under secretary for history, art and culture, and working with private and other public organizations, the Institution established a \u201ccultural recovery center\u201d at the former headquarters of the U.N. Development Program near Port-au-Prince.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not every day at the Smithsonian that you actually get to help save a culture,\u201d Kurin says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing in Haiti.\u201d\n\nOn June 12, after months of preparation, conservators slipped on their gloves in the Haitian capital and got to work. \u201cToday was a very exciting day for...conservators, we got objects into the lab! Woo hoo!\u201d the Smithsonian American Art Museum\u2019s Hugh Shockey enthused on the museum\u2019s Facebook page.\n\nKurin sounded equally pumped. \u201cThe first paintings we brought in were painted by Hector Hyppolite. So we were restoring those on Sunday,\u201d he told me a week later. \u201cThen on Monday our conservator from the American Art Museum was restoring Ta\u00edno, pre-Colombian artifacts. Then on Tuesday the paper conservator was dealing with documents dating from the era of the Haitian struggle for independence. And then the next day we were literally on the scaffolding at the Episcopal cathedral, figuring out how we\u2019re going to preserve the three murals that survived.\u201d\n\nThe task undertaken by the Smithsonian and a long list of partners and supporters that includes the Haitian Ministry of Culture and Communication, the International Blue Shield, the Port-au-Prince-based foundation FOKAL and the American Institute for Conservation seemed daunting; thousands of objects need restoration.\n\nKurin said the coalition will train several dozen Haitian conservators to take over when the Smithsonian bows out in November 2011. \u201cThis will be a generation-long process in which Haitians do this themselves,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes donations from the international community will keep the project alive.\n\nAcross the United States, institutions such as the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, galleries such as Indigo Arts in Philadelphia and Haitian-Americans such as Miami-based artist Edouard Duval Carri\u00e9 were organizing sales and fund-raisers. And more Haitian artists were on the move\u2014some to a three-month residency program sponsored by a gallery in Kingston, Jamaica, others to a biennial exhibition in Dakar, Senegal.\n\nPr\u00e9f\u00e8te Duffaut stayed in Haiti. But during an afternoon we spent together he seemed energized and, though Holy Trinity was mostly a pile of rubble, he was making plans for a new mural. \u201cAnd my mural in the new cathedral will be better than the old ones,\u201d he promised.\n\nMeanwhile, Duffaut had just finished a painting of a star he saw while sitting outside his tent one night. \u201cI\u2019m calling this painting The Star of Haiti,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see, I want all of my paintings to send a message.\u201d\n\nThe painting showed one of Duffaut\u2019s imaginary villages inside a giant star that was hovering like a spaceship over the Haitian landscape. There were mountains in the painting. And people climbing. Before bidding the old master farewell, I asked him what message he wanted this painting to send.\n\n\u201cMy message is simple,\u201d he said without a moment\u2019s hesitation. \u201cHaiti will be back.\u201d\n\nBill Brubaker, formerly a Washington Post writer, has long followed Haitian art.

In popular usage, the term folklore is sometimes restricted to the oral literature tradition.\n\nFolklore studies began in the early 19th century. The first folklorists concentrated exclusively upon rural peasants, preferably uneducated, and a few other groups relatively untouched by modern ways (e.g., gypsies). Their aim was to trace preserved archaic customs and beliefs to their remote origins in order to trace the mental history of mankind. In Germany, Jacob Grimm used folklore to illuminate Germanic religion of the Dark Ages. In Britain, Sir Edward Tylor, Andrew Lang, and others combined data from anthropology and folklore to \u201creconstruct\u201d the beliefs and rituals of prehistoric man. The best-known work of this type is Sir James Frazer\u2019s The Golden Bough (1890).\n\nBritannica Quiz Folklore of the British Isles Quiz\n\nLarge collections of material were amassed in the course of these efforts. Inspired by the Grimm Brothers, whose first collection of fairy tales appeared in 1812, scholars all over Europe began recording and publishing oral literature of many genres: fairy tales and other types of folktales, ballads and other songs, oral epics, folk plays, riddles, proverbs, etc. Similar work was undertaken for music, dance, and traditional arts and crafts; many archives and museums were founded. Often the underlying impulse was nationalistic; since the folklore of a group reinforced its sense of ethnic identity, it figured prominently in many struggles for political independence and national unity.\n\nAs the scholarship of folklore developed, an important advance was the classification of material for comparative analysis. Standards of identification were devised, notably for ballads (by F.J. Child) and for the plots and component motifs of folktales and myths (by Antti Aarne and Stith Thompson). Using these, Finnish scholars, led by Kaarle Krohn, developed the \u201chistorical-geographical\u201d method of research, in which every known variant of a particular tale, ballad, riddle, or other item was classified as to place and date of collection in order to study distribution patterns and reconstruct \u201coriginal\u201d forms. This method, more statistical and less speculative than that of the anthropological folklorists, dominated the field throughout the first half of the 20th century.\n\nAfter World War II new trends emerged, particularly in the United States. Interest was no longer confined to rural communities, since it was recognized that cities too contained definable groups whose characteristic arts, customs, and values marked their identity. Although some Marxist scholars continued to regard folklore as belonging solely to the working classes, in other circles the concept lost its restrictions of class and even of educational level; any group that expressed its inner cohesion by maintaining shared traditions qualified as a \u201cfolk,\u201d whether the linking factor be occupation, language, place of residence, age, religion, or ethnic origin. Emphasis also shifted from the past to the present, from the search for origins to the investigation of present meaning and function. Change and adaptation within tradition were no longer necessarily regarded as corruptive.\n\nIn the view of \u201ccontextual\u201d and \u201cperformance\u201d analysis in the late 20th century, a particular story, song, drama, or custom constitutes more than a mere instance to be recorded and compared with others of the same category. Rather, each phenomenon is regarded as an event arising from the interaction between an individual and his social group, which fulfills some function and satisfies some need for both performer and audience. In this functionalist, sociological view, such an event can be understood only within its total context; the performer\u2019s biography and personality, his role in the community, his repertoire and artistry, the role of the audience, and the occasion on which the performance occurs all contribute to its folkloric meaning."}, {"url": "https://restavekfreedom.org/2017/12/01/5-important-aspects-haitian-culture/", "page_content": "The Caribbean island of Haiti has a rich history full of vivid beauty and heartbreaking tragedy. Its culture is a blend of European and African traditions stemming from the French colonization of San Domingue and the slave practices which brought many of Haiti\u2019s ancestors to its shores. The Haitian people of today reflect the unique nuances of this history in their approach to faith, family, art, and everyday life.\n\nRead on to learn more about 5 important aspects of Haitian culture that can help you gain an understanding of this beautiful island and its resilient people.\n\nFaith\n\nThe majority of Haiti identifies as Christian due to heavy European influences when the country was settled and populated. 80% of Haitian Christians identify as Catholic and only 16% identify as protestant. However, there is another religious practice that coexists alongside Christianity and that is the cultural practice of vodou. Vodou centers around the idea of bad spirits at work on the island and uses candles, incense, and oils, which are intended to appease bad spirits and bring order to chaos and pain.\n\nMusic and Dance\n\nDancing is a part of the Haitian way of life and the music of Haiti draws upon Caribbean, French, African, and Spanish influences. Dancing is a way of life in Haiti, and in some cases can be a part of the religious practices of Haitian vodou. Carnival, one of Haiti\u2019s most celebrated festivals, centers around dancing, as do many social activities such as weddings and church functions.\n\nFootball (Soccer)\n\nAlthough basketball is growing in popularity, there is really only one sport in Haiti and that is football, which we in America refer to as soccer. From their small, local soccer clubs to their talented national teams, Haitians are seriously passionate about the sport. The Haitian National team, also called Les Grenadiers, Le Rouge et Bleu, and Les Bicolores has been a member of FIFA since 1934 and has participated in the World Cup championship once in 1974.\n\nFamily\n\nDespite the confusion that comes with the restavek system, the Haitian people value family above all else. In the midst of the poverty that dominates decision making, parents will sacrifice their own health and lives for the good of the Haitian children, whom they consider \u201cgifts from God.\u201d Extended family is essential to the Haitian way of life and family groups support each other and work as a unit to survive and raise children.\n\nFolklore & Mythology\n\nHaitian folklore is a unique and essential part of Haitian culture and was used by the Haitian dictator Papa Doc to enforce the beliefs of his brutal regime. Folktales often center around mischievous characters or ways to appease the \u201cloa\u201d or spirits at work in Haitian vodou.\n\nRestavek Freedom is a child advocacy organization that exists to bring freedom to children in need and end the restavek system in Haiti. We understand that every precious child matters but that to end slavery, you have to start at the roots. This is why Restavek Freedom is working to educate local officials and leaders on the rights of children and the devastating effects of abuse and child slavery.
