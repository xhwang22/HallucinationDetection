This was the government department that was a boon to family historians - it, even now, is responsible for taking the census and provides demographic information and analyses about the population of the United States.\n\nIn 1911, he was just 9 years old when the United States Supreme Court broke up Standard Oil in May. John D. Rockefeller established Standard Oil in 1870 and it was the largest oil refinery at the time. The Supreme Court found that Standard Oil of New Jersey (one of the many iterations of Standard Oil) was guilty of \"monopolizing the petroleum industry through a series of abusive and anticompetitive actions\". The Court broke up the several entities that comprised Standard Oil and they eventually became competing firms.\n\nIn 1952, he was 50 years old when on February 6th, George VI of England died from a coronary thrombosis and complications due to lung cancer. His eldest daughter, age 25, immediately ascended the throne as Elizabeth II and her coronation was on June 2 1953.\n\nIn 1967, at the age of 65 years old, Frank was alive when between June 5th and 10th, Israeli and Egypt, Jordan, and Syria fought what came to be called the \"Six-Day War\". The hostilities began when Israel launched \"preemptive\" strikes against Egypt, destroying nearly its entire air force. It ended with Israel occupying the Sinai Peninsula, Golan Heights, Gaza Strip and West Bank.\n\nIn 1974, in the year of Frank Mclain's passing, on February 5th, Patty Hearst, age 19 - granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst and daughter of publisher of the San Francisco Examiner Randolph Hearst - was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army, a left wing terrorist group. She was found, alive, 19 months later."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/frank-a-mclain/biography", "page_content": "Frank A.
