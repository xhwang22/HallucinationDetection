{"Cicero Hunt Lewis was a prolific author, writing on a variety of topics including law, politics, history, and literature.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cicero", "page_content": "In the months following Julius Caesar \u2019s assassination in 44 BCE, Marcus Tullius Cicero delivered several speeches that urged the Senate to support Octavian in his struggle against Mark Antony . When Octavian and Antony reconciled, a centurion murdered Cicero on Antony\u2019s order. Cicero\u2019s head and hands were nailed to the rostra in the Roman Forum.\n\nIn his youth, Marcus Tullius Cicero was instructed by the famed rhetorician Molon of Rhodes. Molon did not stick to any one style, instead drifting between florid and concise language. Cicero perfected this methodology, relying on cadence, emotion, and the energy of his audience and interweaving references to literature, philosophy, and history.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero resented the political machinations of Julius Caesar , Pompey , and Marcus Licinius Crassus and initially refused to ally himself with them, even attempting to isolate Pompey from Caesar. However, he later committed himself publicly\u2014if not personally\u2014to their advancement before diminishing his political involvement during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.\n\nIn 63 BCE Marcus Tullius Cicero gave an impassioned oration to his fellow senators that charged Catiline with plotting to stage a violent coup. This so moved the Senate that they voted to implement martial law and execute the conspirators. Cicero was named pater patriae\u2014\u201cfather of the country\u201d\u2014for his service to the republic.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was a masterful orator known for his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in plebeians and patricians alike. Cicero\u2019s political career saw him as quaestor , praetor , consul , and proconsul , providing him with several opportunities to influence the trajectory of Rome and the Senate in the waning days of the republic.\n\nCicero , in full Marcus Tullius Cicero , (born 106 bce, Arpinum, Latium [now Arpino, Italy]\u2014died December 7, 43 bce, Formiae , Latium [now Formia]), Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who vainly tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic . His writings include books of rhetoric , orations, philosophical and political treatises , and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator and the innovator of what became known as Ciceronian rhetoric.\n\nIn the first of his consular speeches, he opposed the agrarian bill of Servilius Rullus, in the interest of the absent Pompey; but his chief concern was to discover and make public the seditious intentions of Catiline, who, defeated in 64, appeared again at the consular elections in 63 (over which Cicero presided, wearing armour beneath his toga). Catiline lost and planned to carry out armed uprisings in Italy and arson in Rome. Cicero had difficulty in persuading the Senate of the danger, but the \u201clast decree\u201d (Senatus consultum ultimum), something like a proclamation of martial law , was passed on October 22. On November 8, after escaping an attempt on his life, Cicero delivered the first speech against Catiline in the Senate, and Catiline left Rome that night. Evidence incriminating the conspirators was secured and, after a senatorial debate in which Cato the Younger spoke for execution and Julius Caesar against, they were executed on Cicero\u2019s responsibility. Cicero, announcing their death to the crowd with the single word vixerunt (\u201cthey are dead\u201d), received a tremendous ovation from all classes, which inspired his subsequent appeal in politics to concordia ordinum, \u201cconcord between the classes.\u201d He was hailed by Catulus as \u201cfather of his country.\u201d This was the climax of his career.\n\nCicero was the son of a wealthy family of Arpinum . Admirably educated in Rome and in Greece , he did military service in 89 under Pompeius Strabo (the father of the statesman and general Pompey ) and made his first appearance in the courts defending Publius Quinctius in 81. His brilliant defense, in 80 or early 79, of Sextus Roscius against a fabricated charge of parricide established his reputation at the bar, and he started his public career as quaestor (an office of financial administration) in western Sicily in 75.\n\nAlliance with the First Triumvirate\n\nAt the end of 60, Cicero declined Caesar\u2019s invitation to join the political alliance of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey, the so-called First Triumvirate, which he considered unconstitutional, and also Caesar\u2019s offer in 59 of a place on his staff in Gaul. When Publius Clodius, whom Cicero had antagonized by speaking and giving evidence against him when he was tried for profanity early in 61, became tribune in 58, Cicero was in danger, and in March, disappointed by Pompey\u2019s refusal to help him, he fled Rome. On the following day Clodius carried a bill forbidding the execution of a Roman citizen without trial. Clodius then carried through a second law, of doubtful legality, declaring Cicero an exile. Cicero went first to Thessalonica, in Macedonia, and then to Illyricum. In 57, thanks to the activity of Pompey and particularly the tribune Titus Annius Milo, he was recalled on August 4. Cicero landed at Brundisium (Brindisi) on that day and was acclaimed all along his route to Rome, where he arrived a month later.\n\nIn winter 57\u201356 Cicero attempted unsuccessfully to estrange Pompey from Caesar. Pompey disregarded Cicero\u2019s advice and renewed his compact with Caesar and Crassus at Luca in April 56. Cicero then agreed, under pressure from Pompey, to align himself with the three in politics, and he committed himself in writing to this effect (the \u201cpalinode\u201d). The speech De provinciis consularibus (On the Consular Provinces) marked his new alliance. He was obliged to accept a number of distasteful defenses, and he abandoned public life. In the next few years he completed the De oratore (55; On the Orator) and De republica (52; On the Republic) and began the De legibus (52; On Laws). In 52 he was delighted when Milo killed Clodius but failed disastrously in his defense of Milo (later written for publication, the Pro Milone, or For Milo).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The province had been expecting a Parthian invasion, but it never materialized, although Cicero did suppress some brigands on Mt. Amanus. The Senate granted a supplicatio (a period of public thanksgiving), although Cicero had hoped for a triumph, a processional return through the city, on his return to Rome. All admitted that he governed Cilicia with integrity.\n\nBy the time Cicero returned to Rome, Pompey and Caesar were struggling against each other for complete power. He was on the outskirts of Rome when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy in January 49. Cicero met Pompey outside Rome on January 17 and accepted a commission to supervise recruiting in Campania. He did not leave Italy with Pompey on March 17, however. His indecision was not discreditable, though his criticism of Pompey\u2019s strategy was inexpert. In an interview with Caesar on March 28, Cicero showed great courage in stating his own terms\u2014his intention of proposing in the Senate that Caesar should not pursue the war against Pompey any further\u2014though they were terms that Caesar could not possibly accept. Cicero disapproved of Caesar\u2019s dictatorship; yet he realized that in the succession of battles (which continued until 45) he would have been one of the first victims of Caesar\u2019s enemies, had they triumphed. This was his second period of intensive literary production, works of this period including the Brutus, Paradoxa Stoicorum (Paradoxes of the Stoics), and Orator (The Orator) in 46; De finibus (On the Supreme Good) in 45; and Tusculanae disputationes (Tusculan Disputations), De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), and De officiis (On Duties), finished after Caesar\u2019s murder, in 44."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Cicero-Hunt-Lewis", "page_content": "Cicero Hunt Lewis (1826\u20131897) was a prominent merchant and investor in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon during the second half of the 19th century. Born in New Jersey, Lewis and a friend, Lucius Allen, traveled across the continent in 1851 to open a dry goods and grocery store in what was then a frontier town of about 800 people living along the west bank of the Willamette River. By 1880, their firm, Allen & Lewis, had become one of the leading wholesale grocery companies on the West Coast.\n\nSupporting transportation projects that affected his business, he was a member of the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee in the 1860s, invested in the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company in the 1870s, and was appointed to the original Port of Portland Commission in the 1890s. He helped form a local subscription library in the 1860s, and he was named to the city's first water board in the 1880s.\n\nMarried to Clementine Couch, daughter of another prominent Portland pioneer, Lewis fathered 11 children and after 1881 lived in a large, elegantly furnished house within walking distance of his office. He spent most of his time at work or at home, and had few other interests aside from church and charitable donations. He died in 1897 while walking to work on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in 1826 in Cranbury, New Jersey, Lewis moved with his parents at age 13 to Newburgh, New York. At age 20, he went to New York City to work in the dry-goods business of Chambers, Heiser & Company.\n\nMerchant-entrepreneur\n\nJohn DeWitt, a New York merchant, hired Lewis in 1851 to assist DeWitt's son-in-law, Lucius Allen, in running a wholesale supply house in Portland, a frontier settlement on the West Coast. Portland, with a population of about 800, was in good position to trade via the Willamette and Columbia rivers and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and other ports and by land with an increasing number of pioneer farmers in the Willamette Valley. Allen, a friend of Lewis, had tried and failed in 1850 to establish a Portland branch store, and DeWitt thought that the more experienced Lewis would be able to help. In 1883 after several setbacks, the two men opened their own business (independent of New York) in a rented store at Front and \"B\" (Burnside) streets. They specialized in dry goods and groceries, building customer loyalty by selling at a fixed price, extending credit to reliable customers, and offering free space in their safe for storage of their customers' gold.\n\nBy 1860, Allen had moved to San Francisco, a seaport city about 600 miles (970 km) south of Portland, where the company bought most of its supplies. He became a silent partner, uninvolved in day-to-day management. By then the firm of Allen & Lewis had begun to focus on wholesale markets, and by 1880, it was one of the leading wholesale grocery firms on the West Coast. Lewis and three contemporaries, Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, and Henry Failing, who arrived in Portland in 1851 and set up businesses along Front Street, became \"merchant princes of the Northwest\".\n\nWithin 10 years, this group of dedicated Front Street merchants and their families would dominate the economic, political and social life of Portland. All became warm and lasting friends with Ladd, the former teacher and railroad agent, first among equals... With Benjamin Stark and John H. Couch, who became Lewis's father-in-law, they formed Portland's earliest Establishment, one of merchant-entrepreneurs.\n\nIn 1864, these four merchants and others formed the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee, to raise money to make the Willamette shipping channel more easily navigable. This led to a federally funded project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dredged the channel in 1866. In 1891, Lewis was named to the original Port of Portland Commission, established by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to oversee the maritime commercial and shipping interests of the city.\n\nWhen railroads began replacing steamships as a shipping method in the 1870s, Lewis, Ladd, Corbett, Failing, and Simeon Reed (a Portland transportation executive), became the five largest stockholders, aside from Henry Villard, in Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N). In 1888, Lewis was part of a group that visited Villard in New York to negotiate favorable shipping rates on the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads, with which Villard and the OR&N had contracts affecting Portland. Lewis's interest in Portland railroads extended to the Portland & Willamette Valley Railroad, of which he became a local director in 1885, and which was controlled and formally taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1890.\n\nLewis and the other three pioneer merchants were among those in 1864 who formed the Mercantile Library Association (later renamed the Library Association of Portland) to establish a local subscription library. Roughly 30 years later, after a public library opened in Portland in 1891, members of the Cicero Lewis family were among its largest donors. In 1885, Lewis was one of 15 men named to the Portland Water Committee, empowered by the state legislature to acquire and operate a municipal water system for the city.\n\nFamily, other interests, death\n\nIn 1857 Lewis married Clementine Couch, daughter of John H. Couch, a sea captain and early Portland settler. Unlike many of his friends, Lewis developed few interests beyond his business. His only form of recreation was walking to work, and although he was a charter member of the Arlington Club and could have dined there, he usually walked home for lunch. Historian E. Kimbark MacColl writes that Lewis \"spent his life at his desk and never went out in the evening for entertainment or the theater... He was never known to have taken a pleasure trip, spending what remaining leisure time he had with his wife and 11 children.\" Lewis died of a stroke in 1897 while walking back to work on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nLewis was a member of the Episcopal Church and a Mason. He was one of the largest supporters of Good Samaritan Hospital and Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland. After Lewis died, his wife funded a hospital addition named in his honor at Good Samaritan.\n\nThe Lewis family lived in a house on Fourth and Everett streets until 1881, when they built a large house on a lot in the Couch tract in northwest Portland. The tract, consisting of half of the block between 19th and 20th streets and Everett and Flanders streets, was owned by Mary Couch, Clementine's sister, and was developed by other members of the Couch family. The project consisted of four houses, each on a lot 100 feet (30 m) wide and 100 feet (30 m) long. The Lewis property, facing 19th Street, included stables, a greenhouse, and a sweeping drive leading to a carriage porch. Their very large house was built in a stick style that was \"rather simple for its period\", but its interior featured tall windows, a massive staircase, front and rear parlors, a reception room with a marble fireplace, and tall mirrors in elaborate frames, as well as \"rare woods, marble mantels, brocaded walls [and] fine lighting fixtures\" throughout. The four houses on the Couch tract were demolished in the 1960s.\n\nWorks cited\n\nGaston, Joseph (1911).

Lewis taught at Oxford University and became a renowned Christian apologist writer, using logic and philosophy to support the tenets of his faith. He is also known throughout the world as the author of The Chronicles of Narnia fantasy series, which have been adapted into various films for the big and small screens.\n\nEarly Life\n\nClive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast, Ireland, on November 29, 1898, to Flora August Hamilton Lewis and Albert J. Lewis. As a toddler, Clive declared that his name was Jack, which is what he was called by family and friends. He was close to his older brother Warren and the two spent much time together as children.\n\nLewis was enraptured by fantastic animals and tales of gallantry, and hence the brothers created the imaginary land of Boxen, complete with an intricate history that served them for years. Lewis' mother died when he was 10, and he went on to receive his pre-college education at boarding schools and from a tutor. During WWI, he served with the British army and was sent home after being wounded by shrapnel. He then chose to live as a surrogate son with Janie Moore, the mother of a friend of Lewis' who was killed in the war.\n\nTeaching Career at Oxford and Wartime Broadcasts\n\nLewis graduated from Oxford University with a focus on literature and classic philosophy, and in 1925 he was awarded a fellowship teaching position at Magdalen College, which was part of the university. There, he also joined the group known as The Inklings, an informal collective of writers and intellectuals who counted among their members Lewis' brother Warren and J.R.R. Tolkien. It was through conversations with group members that Lewis found himself re-embracing Christianity after having become disillusioned with the faith as a youth. He would go on to become renowned for his rich apologist texts, in which he explained his spiritual beliefs via platforms of logic and philosophy.\n\nLewis began publishing work including Spirits in Bondage in 1919 and the satirical Dymer in 1926. After penning other titles \u2014 including The Allegory of Love (1936), for which he won the Hawthornden Prize \u2014 he released in 1938 his first sci-fi work, Out of the Silent Planet, the first of a space trilogy which dealt sub-textually with concepts of sin and desire. Later, during WWII, Lewis gave highly popular radio broadcasts on Christianity which won many converts; his speeches were collected in the work Mere Christianity.\n\nBooks and Film Legacy\n\nLewis was a prolific author of fiction and nonfiction who wrote dozens of books over the course of his career. His faith-based arguments as seen in texts like The Great Divorce (1946) and Miracles (1947) are held in high regard by many theologians, scholars and general readers. His satirical fiction novel The Screwtape Letters (1942) is also a beloved classic. Lewis also continued his love affair with classic mythology and narratives during his later years: His book Till We Have Faces: A Myth Retold (1956) featured the story of Psyche and Cupid. He also penned an autobiography, Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life (1955).\n\nLewis' landmark series, The Chronicles of Narnia, has seen a number of on-screen iterations, including a cartoon version of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe that was released in 1979 and a 1989 film series. Additionally, in 2005, a big-screen adaptation of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe hit movie theaters, starring Tilda Swinton as the witch Jadis and Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan. Two more Narnia films were brought to theaters as well: Prince Caspian (2008) and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010). A movie version of The Silver Chair was slated to hit theaters in the near future, with filming starting in the winter of 2018.\n\nLewis' relationship with his wife, Joy, has also been depicted in Shadowlands, presented as a play and two films; one of the film versions was directed by Richard Attenborough and starred Anthony Hopkins as Lewis.\n\n'The Chronicles of Narnia'\n\nDuring the 1940s, Lewis began writing the seven books that would comprise The Chronicles of Narnia children's series, with The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) being the first release. The story focused on four siblings who, during wartime, walk through an armoire to enter the magical world of Narnia, a land resplendent with mythical creatures and talking animals. Throughout the series, a variety of Biblical themes are presented; one prominent character is Aslan, a lion and the ruler of Narnia, who has been interpreted as a Jesus Christ figure. (Lewis would assert that his Narnia stories weren't a direct allegory to the real world.)\n\nThough the book received some negative reviews, it was generally well-received by readers, and the series retained its international popularity over the following decades.\n\nMarriage\n\nIn 1954, Lewis joined the faculty of Cambridge University as a literature professor, and in 1956 he married an American English teacher, Joy Gresham, with whom he had been in correspondence. Lewis was full of happiness during the years of their marriage, though Gresham died of cancer in 1960. Lewis grieved deeply for his wife and shared his thoughts in the book A Grief Observed, using a pen name.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1963, Lewis resigned from his Cambridge position after experiencing heart trouble. He died on November 22, 1963, in Headington, Oxford.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: C.S.

To use the word writing when describing literature is itself misleading, for one may speak of \u201coral literature\u201d or \u201cthe literature of preliterate peoples.\u201d The art of literature is not reducible to the words on the page; they are there solely because of the craft of writing. As an art, literature might be described as the organization of words to give pleasure. Yet through words literature elevates and transforms experience beyond \u201cmere\u201d pleasure. Literature also functions more broadly in society as a means of both criticizing and affirming cultural values.\n\nDefinitions of the word literature tend to be circular. The 11th edition of Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary considers literature to be \u201cwritings having excellence of form or expression and expressing ideas of permanent or universal interest.\u201d The 19th-century critic Walter Pater referred to \u201cthe matter of imaginative or artistic literature\u201d as a \u201ctranscript, not of mere fact, but of fact in its infinitely varied forms.\u201d But such definitions assume that the reader already knows what literature is. And indeed its central meaning, at least, is clear enough. Deriving from the Latin littera, \u201ca letter of the alphabet,\u201d literature is first and foremost humankind\u2019s entire body of writing; after that it is the body of writing belonging to a given language or people; then it is individual pieces of writing.\n\nliterature , a body of written works. The name has traditionally been applied to those imaginative works of poetry and prose distinguished by the intentions of their authors and the perceived aesthetic excellence of their execution. Literature may be classified according to a variety of systems, including language , national origin, historical period, genre , and subject matter.\n\nThe scope of literature\n\nLiterature is a form of human expression. But not everything expressed in words\u2014even when organized and written down\u2014is counted as literature. Those writings that are primarily informative\u2014technical, scholarly, journalistic\u2014would be excluded from the rank of literature by most, though not all, critics. Certain forms of writing, however, are universally regarded as belonging to literature as an art. Individual attempts within these forms are said to succeed if they possess something called artistic merit and to fail if they do not. The nature of artistic merit is less easy to define than to recognize. The writer need not even pursue it to attain it. On the contrary, a scientific exposition might be of great literary value and a pedestrian poem of none at all.\n\nThe purest (or, at least, the most intense) literary form is the lyric poem, and after it comes elegiac, epic, dramatic, narrative, and expository verse. Most theories of literary criticism base themselves on an analysis of poetry, because the aesthetic problems of literature are there presented in their simplest and purest form. Poetry that fails as literature is not called poetry at all but verse. Many novels\u2014certainly all the world\u2019s great novels\u2014are literature, but there are thousands that are not so considered. Most great dramas are considered literature (although the Chinese, possessors of one of the world\u2019s greatest dramatic traditions, consider their plays, with few exceptions, to possess no literary merit whatsoever).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

All of the world\u2019s classic surveys of history can stand as noble examples of the art of literature, but most historical works and studies today are not written primarily with literary excellence in mind, though they may possess it, as it were, by accident.\n\nThe essay was once written deliberately as a piece of literature: its subject matter was of comparatively minor importance. Today most essays are written as expository, informative journalism, although there are still essayists in the great tradition who think of themselves as artists. Now, as in the past, some of the greatest essayists are critics of literature, drama, and the arts.\n\nSome personal documents (autobiographies, diaries, memoirs, and letters) rank among the world\u2019s greatest literature. Some examples of this biographical literature were written with posterity in mind, others with no thought of their being read by anyone but the writer. Some are in a highly polished literary style; others, couched in a privately evolved language, win their standing as literature because of their cogency, insight, depth, and scope.\n\nMany works of philosophy are classed as literature. The Dialogues of Plato (4th century bc) are written with great narrative skill and in the finest prose; the Meditations of the 2nd-century Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius are a collection of apparently random thoughts, and the Greek in which they are written is eccentric. Yet both are classed as literature, while the speculations of other philosophers, ancient and modern, are not. Certain scientific works endure as literature long after their scientific content has become outdated. This is particularly true of books of natural history, where the element of personal observation is of special importance. An excellent example is Gilbert White\u2019s Natural History and Antiquities of Selbourne (1789).\n\nOratory, the art of persuasion, was long considered a great literary art. The oratory of the American Indian, for instance, is famous, while in Classical Greece, Polymnia was the muse sacred to poetry and oratory. Rome\u2019s great orator Cicero was to have a decisive influence on the development of English prose style. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address is known to every American schoolchild. Today, however, oratory is more usually thought of as a craft than as an art. Most critics would not admit advertising copywriting, purely commercial fiction, or cinema and television scripts as accepted forms of literary expression, although others would hotly dispute their exclusion. The test in individual cases would seem to be one of enduring satisfaction and, of course, truth. Indeed, it becomes more and more difficult to categorize literature, for in modern civilization words are everywhere. Man is subject to a continuous flood of communication. Most of it is fugitive, but here and there\u2014in high-level journalism, in television, in the cinema, in commercial fiction, in westerns and detective stories, and in plain, expository prose\u2014some writing, almost by accident, achieves an aesthetic satisfaction, a depth and relevance that entitle it to stand with other examples of the art of literature."}, {"url": "https://oac.cdlib.org/search?style=oac4;Institution=UC%20Berkeley::Bancroft%20Library;idT=UCb112214071", "page_content": "Title: Cicero Hunt Lewis dictations: and biographical materials, 1888\n\nCreator/Contributor: Lewis, Cicero Hunt, 1826-1897, creator\n\nCreator/Contributor: Victor, Frances Fuller, 1826-1902\n\nCreator/Contributor: Failing, Henry, 1834-1898\n\nCreator/Contributor: Deady, Matthew P.
