{"David Kappos was appointed by President Barack Obama on August 7, 2009.": [{"url": "https://www.uspto.gov/about-us/david-j-kappos", "page_content": "2009-2013\n\nDavid J. Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

Dykes\n\nWhen David Kappos was sworn in as director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in August, he must have felt like a pilot brought in midflight to take the controls of an airplane in a tailspin. He said as much not long after.\n\n\u201cThe nose of this airplane is pointed down,\u201d he bluntly told a gathering of corporate counsel.\n\nAs goes the patent office, so goes the economy, says Kappos, who came to the job from IBM, where he was vice president and assistant general counsel. The PTO either launches or buries innovation, the watchword in a nation whose manufacturing muscle has withered.\n\nAnd it is widely believed the PTO has become a burial ground for potential. Stakeholders have been howling about the agency\u2019s huge and growing backlog. They find applying for a patent to be somewhat like buying a lottery ticket. From universities counting on income from gains in research to independent inventors, from the electronic and high-tech industries to big pharma and biotech, they complain about losing what might have been.\n\n\u201cThat is very, very unfortunate because literally every one of those is a potential breakthrough innovation not being put into the marketplace, not creating jobs, not creating economic advantage for our country,\u201d Kappos says.\n\nOf the agency\u2019s backlog of 1.2 million patent applications, 770,000 have yet to see the initial light of an examiner\u2019s computer screen. The total nearly doubled from 1990 to 2000. Since then the backlog has increased by a factor of 2.5.\n\nMeanwhile, the percentage of patents issued, known as the allowance rate, was steady for decades at about 65 percent or more. It ran up to more than 70 percent beginning in 1998 on the heels of an appellate court decision supporting business-method patents.\n\nBut the number of approvals began going down significantly in 2004, and it plummeted to a stingy 41 percent by fiscal year 2009.\n\nGary Locke, Leslie Kimball, and David Kappos\n\nPhoto: courtesy of USPTO.gov\n\nU.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, whose department includes the PTO, gave a stark assessment of the trend on Aug. 13, speaking to thousands of employees gathered for Kappos\u2019 swearing-in at the agency\u2019s headquarters in Alexandria, Va.\n\n\u201cThis has a direct, negative impact on America\u2019s economic competitiveness, creating uncertainty for entrepreneurs and inventors,\u201d Locke said. \u201cOver time, the PTO has not evolved quickly enough to keep up with America\u2019s changing climate of innovation.\u201d\n\nThe average pendency for a patent application is 38 months. Kappos wants that down to 20 months within three years and then, for patents that qualify for a fast track, 12 months.\n\nBut he\u2019s tasked with doing the near-impossible on the extreme cheap. The PTO faces a $200 million shortfall in 2010 and began a hiring freeze early in 2009. With attrition, the workforce is shrinking by roughly 40 examiners each month.\n\nBIG TITLE, SMALL BUDGET\n\nHis title might vie for longest in the federal government: undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. But now charged with calming the seas, Kappos needs an even bigger budget.\n\nThe PTO is self-funding through fees paid by those seeking patents and trademarks. But there is a wall between the two budgets; trademarks\u2014having their own problems, though much less troubled\u2014can\u2019t subsidize patents.\n\nWhen applications and the resulting fee income soared in the 1990s, there wasn\u2019t a wall high enough to keep Congress from taking $752 million from the office from 1992 through 2004. It became an appropriations cookie jar, with legislators grabbing $200 million one year alone.\n\nNow, with applications and fee payments down, the enormity of the funding shortfall \u201ccreates a pretty big overhang,\u201d Kappos says. In trying to remake an understaffed agency that has a hiring freeze, \u201cfunding is overhanging every decision,\u201d he adds.\n\nCongress mandated a hiring spree in 2005 to pare the backlog. For three years in a row, 1,200 new examiners arrived on the agency\u2019s campus. But that ended abruptly in early 2009.\n\nLocke had asked Congress to impose an emergency 15 percent increase in patent fees to make up for the shortfall. Instead, Congress promised an extra $100 million if the agency could bring in $100 million more than expected. But when a surprising uptick in patent applications made it seem likely that an extra $100 million in patent fees would be generated for 2010, Congress promptly reneged, leaving the agency\u2019s budget unchanged and the general budget as the landing place for any windfall.\n\nNow the agency will be lucky to get back to where it had been. Besides the backlog and poor morale, Kappos has to deal with an antiquated information technology system. Already into the second decade of the 21st century, he says the PTO is still using 20th century technology to handle patent claims by innovators.\n\nHearing news of his appointment, some at the PTO quipped that they hoped Kappos would bring a few truckloads of equipment along with him from IBM.\n\nCIRCUITOUS ROUTE\n\nKappos joined Big Blue as a development engineer in 1983. During the late 1980s he took leaves of absence during two school years to attend full time at the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Boalt Hall. He then worked at IBM\u2019s intellectual property law training center in northern Virginia full time while attending night classes at George Washington University Law School. Boalt Hall accepted those credits for his last year and he received his law degree in 1990.\n\nFrom there he worked in various stops throughout the corporation: storage division, litigation group, assistant general counsel based in Japan for IBM Asia/Pacific, and corporate counsel.\n\nOver the years he dealt firsthand as a customer with the PTO\u2019s problems; he also worked on them as a board member of the American Intellectual Property Law Association, most recently as its vice president, as well as having been vice president of the Intellectual Property Owners Association.\n\nKappos came into the job with a mandate to \u201creboot\u201d the patent office, in the words of Locke. It is more like a complete rebuild, from the agency\u2019s unusual foursquare backing of a legislative reform package to root-and-branch changes in how examiners are graded for performance.\n\nKappos came in with blessings from all sides in an otherwise severely splintered intellectual property community in which the two biggest players, pharma and high- tech, have been in a virtual Cold War over aspects of reform, whether legislative, judicial or within the patent office itself.\n\nAll of this should be enough to keep the IP community\u2019s attention for the foreseeable future. But there could be similar upheaval or change in the courts and legislature in the coming year in what amounts to the possibility of a perfect storm. (See \u201cCongress Takes a Crack\u201d and \u201cCourts Go Back to Basics.\u201d) And yet the possible legislative and judicial changes for the patent system are dwarfed by what has happened and is happening at the patent office.\n\nINVENTING CHAOS\n\nHow did things get this way at an agency that itself was created to decide what is unique and effective at doing something? Consider the \u201cinvention\u201d that used to be U.S. patent No. 6,368,227.\n\nGranted to a 5-year-old Minnesota boy in 2002, it involved pushing a playground swing from side to side rather than the conventional backward-forward motion. The patent\u2019s approval got headlines around the country and eye-rolling chuckles from millions. The boy\u2019s father was a patent lawyer.\n\nAfter all the attention, the patent was revoked, but the sideways swing helped set in motion a contraction in the allowance rate, one that is choking tighter and tighter seven years later.\n\nThat patent \u201cbrought to a head some of the craziness that was going on at the patent office at the time,\u201d says Gene Quinn, a Leesburg, Va.-based patent attorney and author of the IPWatchdog blog. \u201cI point to that swing as significant because so many who have since left the patent office talk about the impact it had.\u201d\n\nAfter the sideways-swing fiasco, new policies and procedures were implemented for quality control. They had the effect of rewarding examiners more for rejecting patents; leading inventors to continue their claims, which amounts to refiling; and pushing morale so low among examiners one might patent the method that got them that way.\n\nJohnathan Dudas\n\nPhoto by AP images\n\nIn 2004, then-PTO head Jonathan W. Dudas implemented two significant quality-control measures:\n\n\u2022 A recertification program for examiners. Where previously examiners were certified in their positions after passing an exam, they now had to be recertified every three years.\n\n\u2022 A \u201csecond pair of eyes\u201d initiative launched in 2000 for closer review of business-method patents was extended to all patent applications.\n\n\u201cThe levels of review got ridiculous,\u201d says Robert Budens, president of the Patent Office Professional Association, the union representing examiners and other patent professionals in the agency. \u201cThe allowance rate began to drop like a stone, in part from a larger fear created in the examining corps, and especially the supervisors who don\u2019t want to get dinged on their performance. People started becoming fearful of allowing things because you could run headlong into quality review problems that make life miserable.\u201d\n\nDudas and Budens agree that a 2005 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit threw even more sand into the patent office\u2019s wheels when it curtailed examiners\u2019 ability to reject patents offering solutions that are obvious. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed that decision in 2007 in KSR International Co. v. Teleflex Inc.\n\nDudas defends his quality-control measures, though he does admit they had some unintended consequences.\n\n\u201cWe focused on quality with a number of new initiatives and the error rate came down,\u201d Dudas explains. \u201cWe anticipated the allowance rate to come down, but didn\u2019t think it would come down as much as it did. You never target an allowance rate.\u201d\n\nWhile morale plummeted among examiners, it probably wasn\u2019t that good at the top, either. All the while in the background, from cocktail palaver to prominent blogs, there were questions about the bona fides of political appointees in the PTO leadership, some of whose backgrounds ran deep in politics and shallow on patents.\n\nBruce Lehman\n\nPhoto: courtesy of www.iam-magazine.com\n\nIn crafting the American Inventor Protection Act of 1999, Congress inserted a proviso calling for the director and other high-level appointees to have \u201ca professional background and experience in patent or trademark law.\u201d The previous year Bruce Lehman had resigned as agency director. Appointed in 1993, he was credited by some with bringing the agency and intellectual property issues from the backwaters to a prominent stage, but Lehman was dogged by the fact that his background was in copyrights.\n\nAfter his failed efforts to get the U.S. Copyright Office moved from the Library of Congress to the PTO, Lehman ended up leaving in 1998. Q. Todd Dickinson, with an extensive career in patent law, took over for the final two years of the Clinton administration.\n\nIn 2001 President George W. Bush appointed James Rogan, who had no experience in patents, trademarks or intellectual property in general. As a congressman, he had been one of 13 U.S. House managers in President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment trial, and in the 2000 elections, his Los Angeles County constituency showed their disapproval at the polls. Bush picked him up.\n\nAfter a little more than two years, Rogan resigned and went into private practice. He now is a California state court judge. He was succeeded by Dudas, who also came from Capitol Hill in 2002 to be the agency\u2019s No. 2 appointee. Dudas had worked on intellectual property matters as a congressional staffer, but otherwise had no background in patent or trademark law.\n\nMargaret Peterlin\n\nPhoto: courtesy USPTO.gov\n\nIn 2007, a San Francisco lawyer and patent activist, Gregory Aharonian, along with several others, sued for the removal of a political appointee in a high-level position at the PTO, saying she was not qualified under the provisions of the 1999 statute. The suit claimed Margaret Peterlin\u2019s only qualification was that she\u2019d served as a senior aide to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who resigned in late 2007 not long after her appointment.\n\nJudge James Robertson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia dismissed the case in December 2007, finding no congressional intent for a private cause of action. But in his opinion, Robertson wrote that even if he couldn\u2019t order it, it would be good if Peterlin acknowledged her deficiencies and asked various PTO constituencies for help.\n\n\u201cBesides holding out the prospect of actually addressing the real problems besetting the office,\u201d he wrote, \u201cany such behavior from Ms. Peterlin would be a refreshing change from the hostility and adversarial stance taken in recent times by patent office management.\u201d\n\nThe point was made. Peterlin resigned eight months later, in August 2008.\n\nJames Rogan\n\nPhoto: courtesy of Tim Sloan/AFP/Getty images\n\n\u201cIf I had known about the law, I\u2019d have sued earlier over Rogan and Dudas,\u201d says Aharonian, whose expertise is in picking apart existing patents through in-depth research into prior art and previous innovations. He also distributes his sometimes gossipy, often strident and usually informative Patnews e-mail to subscribers to the Internet Patent News Service.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nBefore Kappos was appointed, president Barack Obama\u2019s transition team was making calls to learn what to do about the PTO. They didn\u2019t ask about legislative reform, which has been on Congress\u2019 platter for several years. They wanted to know how to fix the office as a functioning bureaucracy. One difficulty was to find someone acceptable to the intellectual property community as a whole.\n\nIBM has its own particular wants and needs in an IP community that is diverse and splintered on issues such as damages in litigation and proposals for post-grant review of patents to head off lawsuits.\n\nBut Kappos\u2019 arrival was welcomed by all (except the anti-patent crowd, who believe patents stifle innovation). Almost immediately he began a flurry of bold initiatives designed to shore up sagging morale within the agency, soothe the biggest concerns of innovators and reduce the backlog, without having to sacrifice quality.\n\nBarely a couple of weeks into the job, he did the unthinkable\u2014he attempted to change the 30-year-old system of rewards and penalties that decide how patent examiners perform their jobs. Kappos sent an e-mail to all examiners addressing the culture of rejection in which a lower allowance rate became the measure of higher quality. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Patent quality does not equal rejection.\u201d\n\nKappos says he \u201cfiguratively\u201d locked the agency\u2019s top managers and union officials in a room for six weeks until they hammered out a new \u201ccount system\u201d for how examiners are evaluated in moving patent claims through the process.\n\nAt the outset, surprising some and showing seriousness about getting something done, he gave full decision-making authority to the deputy commissioner of patents he sent to the negotiations, Margaret \u201cPeggy\u201d Focarino. She has been at the agency since 1977 and for many years supervised patent examiners and their immediate supervisors.\n\nThe resulting changes, putting more emphasis on the initial patent examination and giving less credit for those that are drawn out through re-examination, were announced in early October and will be phased in. They also end the much-hated, labor-intensive recertification program for examiners.\n\n\u201cThat was a major accomplishment and a major paradigm shift in how we\u2019ve done business in the past,\u201d says union president Budens. \u201cDuring the last administration, unions were persona non grata.\u201d\n\nAt about the same time, Kappos rescinded widely despised rules proposed by the Bush administration for handling patent applications. Among other things, they would have severely limited attempts at convincing examiners of a claim\u2019s merit in a system that had become weighted in favor of rejections.\n\nMany of Kappos\u2019 early efforts have involved making a clear break with the past, especially the most recent past. When he rescinded the rules, the very first sentence in an agency news release described them as \u201chighly controversial regulations proposed by the previous administration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose rules went through the Administrative Procedures Act process and got almost 600 negative comments, the biggest response to a rule-change package in the history of the agency,\u201d says Budens. \u201cVirtually all of them were negative and the agency leadership just ignored them.\u201d\n\nAs an official with the American Intellectual Property Law Association, Kappos filed an affidavit on behalf of the association\u2019s friend-of-the-court brief supporting a court challenge of the proposed rules. The rules were stopped by federal court injunction, and soon after coming to the PTO, Kappos rescinded the rules package and the case was dropped.\n\nBut the union, which has been whipsawed by changes in agency leadership over the past 20 years, still opposes the PTO\u2019s bid for Congress to grant it more substantive rule-making powers\u2014considered unlikely at present.\n\n\u201cWhat Dave [Kappos] has to do is try to win [union members] back over,\u201d says former PTO head Dickinson, \u201cand the challenge, of course, is that Dave is here today but who will be there tomorrow?\u201d\n\nHe is speaking of the union, but it could easily apply to relations with Congress, too.\n\nKappos is working on it.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.patentbaristas.com/archives/2009/06/19/ibms-david-kappos-to-be-nominated-as-under-secretary-of-commerce/", "page_content": "President Barack Obama has announced his intent to nominate David J. Kappos as Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nAccording to the press release:\n\nMr. Kappos is Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, for IBM Corporation. Based in Armonk, New York, Mr. Kappos directs IBM\u2019s Intellectual Property Law function, providing legal counsel over all facets of protecting and licensing IBM\u2019s intellectual property assets and leading IBM\u2019s engagement of intellectual property law policy issues. In particular, Mr. Kappos is responsible for the management of IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios; protecting and licensing intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks, know-how and technology) worldwide; directing intellectual property law operations relating to the research, services, consulting, computer systems, storage products, semiconductor and technology development, software, marketing and other groups, divisions, and entities within IBM. In addition, Mr. Kappos has responsibility for IP policy and coordination with IBM\u2019s litigation and corporate development groups in matters relating to intellectual property. Mr. Kappos serves on the Board of Directors of the American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, and the International Intellectual Property Society. He is also the Vice President of the Intellectual Property Owners Association. He has held various previous leadership positions in intellectual property law associations in Asia and the U.S. He has spoken widely in Asia, Europe, and the U.S. on intellectual property topics. Mr. Kappos received his Bachelor of Science Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of California Davis in 1983, and his law degree from the University of California Berkeley in 1990. He joined IBM in 1983 as a Development Engineer and has served as an Intellectual Property Law attorney in IBM\u2019s Storage Division and Litigation group, as IP Law Counsel in IBM Software Group, as Assistant General Counsel in IBM Asia/Pacific, IBM Corporate Counsel and as Assistant General Counsel prior to his current position.\n\nThis is sure to be a blow to Gene Quinn, of IPWatchdog, who nominated Alfred E. Neuman for PTO Director. Gene\u2019s rationale:\n\nA character like Al Neuman would be perfect because he wouldn\u2019t (and couldn\u2019t) get in the way of the progress being made by the quite able members of the PTO senior management team who are doing what is necessary to move the PTO forward. Amazing what can be accomplished without having the watchful eye (and meddling) of a political appointment.\n\nThe Coalition for Patent Fairness (CPF) has already issued the its statement regarding the nomination of Kappos as Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office:\n\nThe PTO has an important role to play in fostering an economic environment that promotes American innovation and global competitiveness, spurs new product development and creates jobs here in the United States. As leading U.S. patent holders, we look forward to the opportunity to work with Mr. Kappos in helping the PTO fulfill that important responsibility. We support President Obama\u2019s call for reforms to the US patent system that will spur innovation and job creation.\n\nThe IAM Blog thinks Kappos is good news for the USPTO and the wider IP community:\n\nFor my part, I think he will do an excellent job. He knows the issues; he has a strong IP background; he comes from an industry in which IP is hugely important; he knows all the major players; he has long management experience; and he thinks deeply about IP and its role in society. Frankly, I cannot think of anyone better to do the job. He is not perfect, but who is? President Obama has made a good choice.\n\nDennis Crouch at Patently-O is excited:\n\nAs someone who writes daily about US Patent Law, I am excited about the Kappos nomination because he is likely to open access to previously hidden data and information. He will also work to create systems that work and measures that are meaningful. I suspect that the biggest challenge for Mr. Kappos will be moving beyond the unique IBM perspective. Big Blue is an atypical patent owner in its internal systems, patenting volume, and licensing power. As I discussed earlier, it will be important for him to spend time understanding how the rest of the patent community operates.\n\nBiotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) President and CEO Jim Greenwood gave Kappos a thumbs up:\n\nWe believe Mr. Kappos will bring a thoughtful perspective to the Department of Commerce and the USPTO. He has a long history of industry experience, providing a point of view and insights we have always thought to be highly valuable in this position. He also has a demonstrated track record of managing a large organization, and a true appreciation for industrial innovation. As a prominent and respected member of the patent community, Mr. Kappos brings much goodwill to this position. We look forward to working with him and his leadership team over the coming years.\n\nThe Patent Prospector questions the nomination given that IBM has submitted some questionable patent applications (citing its 2009/0119,148 application for \u201cenhancing productivity,\u201d which appears to claims claims using shorter hours to facilitate shorter meetings):\n\nPresident Obama announced today nominees for two related governmental posts: Director, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, Department of Energy; and Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Warren F. \u201cPete\u201d Miller, Jr., a part-time Professor at Texas A&M University, got the easier job. Managing the real radioactive waste went to David J. Kappos, who, as long-time corporate mook, has shaped IBM patent policy, publicly spouting horse hockey in the process. People have been known to rise to a position, garnering dignity. Let\u2019s hope these boys are up to the job of containing the waste."}, {"url": "https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2014/11/12/682337/33866/en/Former-USPTO-Director-David-Kappos-Appointed-Special-Advisor-to-Board-of-ipCreate-Inc.html", "page_content": "BONITA SPRINGS, Fla., Nov. 12, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via PRWEB - Former United States Under Secretary of Commerce and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) David Kappos has been appointed special advisor to the Board of ipCreate (http://www.ipcreateinc.com), the company announced today.\n\nThe Honorable David Kappos is the latest in a string of high-profile leaders in the intellectual property business field who have taken on roles involving the Board and Executive ranks of ipCreate, an Invention On Demand\u00ae company that partners with global technology firms to create patented inventions to complement their own internal R&D efforts.

Obama\u2019s mother, S. Ann Dunham, grew up in Kansas, Texas, and Washington state before her family settled in Honolulu. In 1960 she and Barack Sr. met in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii and married less than a year later.\n\nWhen Obama was age two, Barack Sr. left to study at Harvard University; shortly thereafter, in 1964, Ann and Barack Sr. divorced. (Obama saw his father only one more time, during a brief visit when Obama was 10.) Later Ann remarried, this time to another foreign student, Lolo Soetoro from Indonesia, with whom she had a second child, Maya.

Obama did not remove any of the career appointees to ambassadorships.\n\n\n\nFULL QUESTION\n\nSubject: Ambassadors\n\n\n\nDid President Barack Obama fire all the ambassadors who had been appointed by George W. Bush?\n\nFULL ANSWER\n\nThe issue of ambassadors \u201cfired\u201d by President Barack Obama has arisen recently in the context of President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt removal of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in May.\n\nAlthough the State Department announced at the time that Yovanovitch was ending her three-year assignment in Ukraine \u201cas planned,\u201d her term was not yet completed.\n\nYovanovitch emerged as one of the key witnesses in the House impeachment inquiry. In her public testimony on Nov. 15, Yovanovitch said that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s private attorney, spread false statements about her that led to her removal as ambassador.\n\n\u201cMr. Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine,\u201d Yovanovitch testified. \u201cAlthough, then and now, I have always understood that I served at the pleasure of the President, I still find it difficult to comprehend that foreign and private interests were able to undermine U.S. interests in this way.\u201d\n\nDuring her testimony, Trump tweeted criticism of Yovanovitch, claiming that everywhere she has served as an ambassador, including in Somalia, \u201cturned bad.\u201d Trump noted: \u201cIt is a U.S. President\u2019s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Sean Hannity the following night, White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said the president, in his tweet, \u201cwas telling people why he was unhappy with that ambassador, which is every president\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nGrisham then added, \u201cI\u2019d also like to remind people that Obama fired every Bush-appointed ambassador the day he was elected office. Every president has the right to have people representing them in foreign countries that he trusts.\u201d\n\nThat same day, Republican Rep. Mark Meadows tweeted: \u201cFor Washington Democrats and pundits who are incredulous that @realDonaldTrump recalled an ambassador, certain that it must be evidence of a conspiracy\u2026 President Obama fired every Bush appointed ambassador upon his election.\u201d\n\nThe same argument about Obama firing all of Bush\u2019s appointments made its way into a number of Facebook memes. We received numerous questions from our readers asking about the claim as well.\n\nTrump is right that he has the authority to remove and replace any ambassador he wishes. But his defenders are twisting the facts about Obama to make an argument that Trump\u2019s removal of Yovanovitch was not out of the ordinary. It was.\n\nThere are two types of ambassadors appointed by presidents: career ambassadors and political ambassadors. Career ambassadors are those who make a career in the foreign service and often serve under multiple presidents of different parties. Those career ambassadors usually make up about 70 percent of the ambassadors. Political ambassadors, on the other hand, are typically replaced with political supporters of the incoming president.\n\n\u201cAll ambassadors by tradition present their resignations at the start of any new presidential term (either first or second),\u201d explained retired U.S. Ambassador Dennis Jett, a professor of international affairs at Penn State. \u201cThe resignations of the 70 percent (typically) that are career officers are almost always returned and they are allowed to stay and complete whatever is left of what is normally a 3-year tour of duty. Usually, all of those of the 30 percent that are political appointees are accepted.\u201d\n\nObama was no different in that respect. Meadows\u2019 tweet linked to a Washington Post story from Dec. 3, 2008, which stated that the \u201cincoming Obama administration has notified all politically-appointed ambassadors that they must vacate their posts as of Jan. 20, the day President-elect Barack Obama takes the oath of office, a State Department official said.\u201d\n\nThe article speculated that while \u201cpolitical ambassadors sometimes are permitted to stay on briefly during a new administration\u201d the \u201csweeping nature of the directive suggests that Obama has little interest in retaining any of Bush\u2019s ambassadorial appointees.\u201d\n\nIn fact, though, Obama did keep on more than a dozen of Bush\u2019s political appointees, some for a few weeks, some for more than a year. For example, Clifford Sobel stayed on until August 2009. An online bio of Sobel, who is an international council member at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard Kennedy School, notes that he served as \u201cAmbassador to the Netherlands and Brazil, spanning both the Bush and Obama Administrations.\u201d And Victor Ashe, a Bush political appointee, told PolitiFact he was \u201cflattered\u201d that Obama asked him to continue serving as ambassador to Poland until his successor was confirmed, which ended up being nine months into Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nIn addition to those two men, some political ambassadors were kept on a few extra weeks, leaving in February. Others were kept longer: one until April, one until May, two until June and two until the following year.\n\nBy contrast, a New York Times story on Jan. 5, 2017, noted the Trump administration was far less flexible, \u201cbreaking with decades of precedent by declining to provide even the briefest of grace periods\u201d and requiring all of Obama\u2019s political appointees to be out by Trump\u2019s inauguration. (There was one exception made for S. Fitzgerald Haney, the ambassador in Costa Rica, who was allowed to extend his ambassadorship a few extra months to allow his children to graduate high school. But by February 2017, he was the lone non-career ambassador appointed by Obama still in his position.)\n\nPolitical appointees to ambassadorships have the expectation that they will vacate their position by the Inauguration Day of the incoming president, said \u00c1sgeir Sigf\u00fasson, executive director of the American Foreign Service Association. Given that tradition, it \u201csounds a little harsher\u201d to describe those ambassadors as being \u201cfired,\u201d but the effect is the same, Sigf\u00fasson, said.\n\nRegardless of the terminology, though, Obama did not fire any of the career foreign service ambassadors, James Steinberg, the deputy secretary of state under Obama from 2009 to 2011, told us via email. We checked, using data from the State Department\u2019s Office of the Historian, and of the more than 100 career ambassadors appointed by Bush, and inherited by Obama, none was terminated at the start of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nAnd that\u2019s where this analogy falls apart.\n\nYovanovitch is a career diplomat. She has served for 33 years as a foreign service officer during six administrations, four Republican and two Democratic. She was appointed to serve as an ambassador three times: twice by George W. Bush (Kyrgyz Republic and Armenia) and once by Obama (Ukraine). Although her initial term as ambassador to Ukraine was scheduled to expire in March 2019, she was asked by Trump\u2019s under secretary of state for political affairs, David Hale, to extend her tour until 2020. Trump removed her two months after the extension.\n\n\u201cThe attempt to \u2018normalize\u2019 Trump\u2019s treatment of Yovanovitch fails,\u201d W. Robert Pearson, a former ambassador to Turkey and currently a non-resident scholar at The Middle East Institute, told us via email, because of \u201cthe repeated complaints that she was interfering in Giuliani\u2019s effort to push the bogus Ukraine conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nSaid Jett: \u201cShe was a very distinguished career officer, three-time ambassador, and had just been asked by the department \u2026 to extend for a fourth year, which is very rare.\u201d\n\nSo to recap, although Obama immediately terminated most of Bush\u2019s political appointees, he made more than a dozen exceptions (compared with the one exception that Trump made). But Obama did not \u201cfire\u201d any of the career foreign service officials appointed to be ambassadors by Bush. Yovanovitch, the ambassador at the heart of this debate, was a career appointment.\n\n\n\nSources\n\nU.S. Department of State website. Marie L. Yovanovitch, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine.

IBM has been very smart on IPR issues lately, recognizing that knowledge is often more valuable when shared. Coming from a successful technology firm, he will have both credibility and insight into innovation policy. He brings more balance to the job than anyone we can remember. Below are some interesting quotes from various articles.\n\nFebruary 2007 interview in IP Review online Managing IP the IBM way.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening at the moment is that IBM\u2019s IP lawyers are being aligned along a new philosophical axis. Under the leadership of Palmisano and the direction of Dr John E Kelly III, IBM\u2019s senior vice-president for technology and intellectual property, the approach to patent protection is shifting. After years of strenuously protecting all its patents the company is now backing the movement towards open standards. And this is changing everything. \u2018We are now the biggest supporters of the open source development project,\u2019 explains David. \u2018Admittedly this policy is not easily reconcilable with our traditional IP strategy, but we are convinced that it is the way to go for the future.\u2019 In a nutshell, the open source movement aims to encourage the sharing of systems so as to maximise the accessibility and use of information technology. By breaking down protective attitudes and encouraging people to drop the legal barriers around their intellectual property the open source movement believes that, in the long run, it will enable the technology to fulfil its potential and best serve its customers. David is able to speak confidently about these issues because, like many IBM lawyers, he is a \u2018tekkie\u2019 by origin. \u2018IP lawyers at IBM need to have deep domain expertise \u2013 it\u2019s a must-have,\u2019 he explains. \u2018In my case I gained a degree in Electrical and computer Engineering before switching across to law. It would frankly be very difficult to do my job without a technical background. You have to be able to speak the language of the technical experts with whom you are dealing.\u2019 As well as occupying a key role in IBM, David has also held various leadership positions in IP law associations in Asia and the US. Indeed it is the drive for industry leadership which has inspired the company\u2019s latest initiative, launched in autumn 2006, to introduce a new, groundbreaking corporate policy governing the creation and management of patents. Linked to IBM\u2019s support for open source, the policy aims to \u2018encourage others in the patent community to adopt similar policies and practices, more stringent than currently required by law\u2019. The purpose of this, as David explains, is to avoid using IP inappropriately and to manage its patents in a way that exceeds legal obligations. \u2018It\u2019s a fundamental strategic shift,\u2019 says David, \u2018meaning that we want patents to be used as a tool of inclusion. We want to show that patents can be used to facilitate the development of the open source environment.\u2019 Being open\n\nAs a concrete demonstration of its commitment IBM has donated 500 specific patents to the Open Source Movement so that anyone can use them. \u2018This would have been unthinkable a decade ago,\u2019 says David, \u2018but it is the way forward. Our intention is to continue to donate and to build more on top of the open source platform.\u2019\n\nAnd also this article:\n\n\u2018Eco-Patent Commons\u2019 hopes to improve environmental innovation San Francisco Chronicle , Tom Abate, Chronicle Staff Writer, Monday, January 14, 2008 IBM Corp., Nokia, Sony and Pitney Bowes are expected to announce Monday that they have put 31 inventions into an \u201cEco-Patent Commons\u201d designed to make these Earth-friendly manufacturing and waste-reduction processes more widely available. \u201cThis is an open source effort along the lines of the Creative Commons,\u201d said IBM assistant general counsel David Kappos, who is responsible for the company\u2019s intellectual property. The open source movement, symbolized by the free Linux operating system, believes that innovation occurs more quickly when new ideas and processes are open to the public for anyone to troubleshoot and improve. The Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization devoted to the same idea of openness, but with a focus on copyrighted works like entertainment and literature. Until now, patents have been the antithesis of these sorts of free-for-all philosophies, because a patent enables its holder to have exclusive control over the invention for a period of up to 20 years, the idea being to give the inventor a chance to recoup the effort during this period of exclusivity. The Eco-Patent Commons adopts this activist tactic in certain fields \u2013 like waste reduction \u2013 where the participating firms have decided that the societal benefit of having every willing manufacturer adopt these cleaner processes outweighs any potential advantage they might gain by keeping the idea close to the vest. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask permission, you don\u2019t have to pay a royalty,\u201d Kappos said.\n\nOr this:\n\nDenise Howell, AlwaysOn Stanford Summit: lawyers for Google, IBM, and Apple ponder the patent system, ZDNet August 1st, 2007. David Kappos, VP and Asst. Gen. Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, IBM: For some industries the current patent system is working well, bio and pharma in particular. But from the standpoint of the information technology industry, where patents are regularly granted that have significant quality problems and there\u2019s no regularized market for understanding the validity and value of a patent, it\u2019s easy to view the system as broken. David Kappos: IBM is the largest patent holder. Question: should the government be more concerned with hiring more patent examiners or dealing with the patent troll problem? David doesn\u2019t think hiring more examiners is a fix for all the current patent problems. The patent office also needs to move to a much more adaptive process, leverage technology in the public domain, and reach out to the communities that exist in this area. David Kappos: Something that might be a little bit controversial that he would tell clients is to be cognizant of what others are doing. There is a school of thought that you shouldn\u2019t look at others\u2019 patents because you can be liable for enhanced damages if you\u2019re found to have infringed. Kappos thinks it\u2019s better to know what\u2019s going on, and he tends to take the defensive yet proactive approach of looking at others\u2019 portfolios. IBM does clear its products and services initiatives in advance, and takes advantage of its thousands of cross-licensing deals. You don\u2019t want to put a product out then have to face someone with a patent you have no way of answering.\n\nHere is the USPTO press release on the appointment.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.uspto.gov/main/homepagenews/2009jun19.htm\n\n\n\nPresident Obama Announces Intent to Nominate David Kappos as Patent and Trademark Director\n\nPresident Barack Obama on Thursday announced his intent to nominate David Kappos, an experienced patent professional with more than 20 years of experience, as the new Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\n\n\u201cThe United States Patent and Trademark Office faces significant challenges, and it needs an experienced leader like David at the helm,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said. \u201cHe will be a strong voice for patent reform and I have tasked him to reduce dramatically the unacceptably long time the office takes to review patent applications.\u201d\n\nOver a 20-year career, Kappos has accrued deep knowledge of the patent system and broad respect from professionals across the field \u2013 including the biotech, life sciences and high tech sectors. He is currently vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property at IBM. Specifically, Kappos manages IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios \u2013 protecting and licensing intellectual property worldwide.\n\nIf he is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Kappos will take control of an office that provides incentives to encourage technological advancement and helps businesses protect their investments, promote their goods and safeguard against deception in the marketplace. The office continues to deal with a patent application backlog of more than 770,000, long waiting periods for patent review, information technology systems that are regarded as outdated and an application process in need of reform.\n\nKappos serves on the Board of Directors of the American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, and the International Intellectual Property Society. He is also the Vice President of the Intellectual Property Owners Association. He has held various previous leadership positions in intellectual property law associations in Asia and the U.S. He has spoken widely in Asia, Europe, and the U.S. on intellectual property topics.\n\nKappos received his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California-Davis in 1983, and his law degree from the University of California Berkeley in 1990. He joined IBM in 1983 as a development engineer and has served in a variety of roles before taking his current position, including intellectual property law attorney in IBM\u2019s Storage Division and Litigation group, IP Law Counsel in IBM\u2019s Software Group, assistant general counsel for IBM Asia/Pacific, IBM Corporate Counsel and assistant general counsel."}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/who-is-on-the-federal-reserve-board/", "page_content": "by Paula Moura\n\nFeb. 22, 2022, update: There are currently four members of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors: Jerome Powell, Lael Brainard, Michelle Bowman and Christopher J.

The president of the New York bank always votes; the others rotate.\n\nHow does someone make it onto the board?\n\nEach of the board\u2019s seven governors is appointed by the sitting U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate \u2014 either to a full 14-year term or to fill the remainder of an unexpired term. (By contrast, the 12 Federal Reserve regional bank presidents are chosen by search committee.) Board members have included economists, lawyers, scholars, private equity managers, and longtime public servants in the Fed or the Treasury.\n\nOf the 109 governors appointed since the first board was officially sworn in, in August 1914, three have been African American and ten have been women.\n\nRead more: 5 Things You May Not Know About Jerome Powell, Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve\n\nIt\u2019s not unusual that a Fed governor who served as chair under one administration is reappointed as chair by another; take Ben Bernanke, who was appointed by George W. Bush but became better known during the Obama years for the Fed\u2019s economic stimulus in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to know when or if a potential governor turns down a nomination, but some appointees have been rejected by the Senate. One of the most famous cases is Peter Diamond, a Nobel Prize winner, professor at MIT and Obama appointee. The Republican-controlled Senate rejected Diamond in 2010, citing his background in labor economics instead of monetary policy. A majority-Republican Senate also rejected Trump appointees \u2014 most famously in 2020 Judy Shelton, a former Trump advisor who advocated for the return of the gold standard.\n\nDoes the chair have more power than the other governors?\n\nThat depends on whether you mean power or influence. On the position of chair, David Wessel, head of the Brookings Institute\u2019s Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, said, \u201cHis legal power is somewhat limited, but his actual power, in fact, is very strong, because what the chairman says usually prevails.\u201d (Read more about Jerome Powell, the current chair.)\n\nThe board also has a vice chair and, most recently, a vice chair of supervision \u2014 an informal position that became official after Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, regulating banks following the 2008 credit crisis.\n\nBoard members can\u2019t be fired over their policy opinions, only by \u201ccause,\u201d a legal term for breaking the law. They can be pressured publicly by members of Congress or by presidents, as when President Donald Trump complained about Powell increasing interest rates in December 2018.\n\nCongress \u201ccan send signals, threatening to pass legislation \u2026 or making it known that Congress is unhappy about a particular decision. It\u2019s an informal pressure, and there\u2019s no guarantee the Fed will respond, but Congress does have the capacity to try to influence them,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University and co-author of The Myth of Independence: How Congress Governs the Federal Reserve.\n\nCongress created the Fed in 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act and could potentially disband it, but doing so would take a lot of effort. Binder said Congress could pass laws effectively directing the Fed into action \u2014 setting a target employment rate, for example \u2014 but these would have to be signed by the U.S. president.\n\nDo most governors stay for the entire 14-year term?\n\nTerms were mandated to last up to 14 years to provide political independence, but governors usually stay less time \u2014 on average, about seven years. The longest-tenured governor was economist Menc S. Szymczak, who served from 1933 to 1961 and was reappointed twice.\n\nIf all governors finished out their terms, the current board would contain members nominated by President George W. Bush. But the longest-sitting governor currently on the board is Powell, appointed by President Barack Obama in May 2012. The only other Obama appointee is Lael Brainard, who joined the board in June 2014.\n\nThose who come from academia often take leave from their teaching or research jobs to join the board for a few years. Others leave the board to go into the private sector.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that, if you spend a couple of years on the Federal Reserve board, you can make a lot of money in the private sector when you leave,\u201d Wessel said. \u201cSome people leave to make money. That\u2019s the temptation.\u201d Congress last adjusted the board\u2019s salaries in 2019, setting the chair\u2019s annual pay at $203,500 and $183,100 for the other governors.\n\nRead more: How the Stock Market & U.S. Household Income Diverged After the 2008 Crash\n\nMany governors join the board by finishing out the term of someone who left early; in this case, governors can be reappointed to another term. The last time a governor stayed a full term was Alan Greenspan, whose term expired in 2006. He was the only chair reappointed by four different presidents: Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.\n\nFor the positions of chair and vice chair, terms are four years. Chairs are often reappointed by an incoming president, but President Trump broke this informal tradition by not reappointing Obama\u2019s pick, Janet Yellen, instead nominating the current chair, Powell.\n\nUnless he chooses to leave early, Powell\u2019s term as chair will end in 2022. President Biden\u2019s first nomination to the Board of Governors will come this year, for the vice chair of supervision \u2014 a role experts imagine he will fill with someone tough on banks.\n\nWho are the current governors?\n\nJerome Powell, board chair, age 68\n\nTook office: 2012, appointed by President Obama; became chair in 2018, appointed by President Trump\n\nTerm ends: 2022, as chair; 2028, as governor\n\nRead more about the current chair, who earned his law degree from Georgetown University and did not have a background as an economist.\n\nRichard Clarida, vice chair, age 64\n\nTook office: 2018, appointed by President Trump\n\nTerm ends: 2022, as vice chair and governor\n\nClarida was a professor of economics and international affairs at Columbia University for 30 years. He also worked as a top official in the U.S. Treasury under the George W. Bush administration and at the investment firm PIMCO.\n\nRandal Quarles, vice chair for supervision, age 63\n\nTook office: 2017, appointed by President Trump\n\nTerm ends: October 2021, as vice chair; 2032, as governor\n\nA top Treasury official during the George W. Bush administration, Quarles founded the investment firm Cynosure Group with members of the Eccles family. Quarles is married to a relative of Marriner Eccles, the Fed chair from 1936 to 1948 for whom he Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C., is named.\n\nUpdate: Quarles submitted his resignation to the board on Nov. 8, 2021.\n\nMichelle Bowman, governor, age 50\n\nTook office: 2018, appointed by President Trump\n\nTerm ends: 2034\n\nBefore serving as the state bank commissioner of Kansas and the vice president of a Kansas bank, Bowman held various positions in the federal government, including director of congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She is a member of the New York Bar Association.\n\nLael Brainard, governor, age 59\n\nTook office: 2014, appointed by President Obama\n\nTerm ends: 2026\n\nBrainard was a top Treasury official under the Obama administration. She has worked as an associate professor of applied economics at MIT and at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nChristopher Waller, governor, age 62\n\nTook office: 2020, appointed by President Trump\n\nTerm ends: 2030\n\nWaller served as executive vice president and director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis from 2009 to 2020. Previously, he a chair of economics at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nOpen seat\n\nThere\u2019s currently one open seat on the board of governors; Quarles could occupy it when his term as vice chair of supervision ends in October. Of the opening, Binder said, \u201cThe chair decisions matter a lot, but given the number of appointments that presidents have to make \u2026 the sixth or seventh seat on the board, with all the respect, to fill that spot is just much less important, politically and policy-wise, for the White House.\u201d\n\nIn addition to streaming below, The Power of the Fed is available in FRONTLINE\u2019s online collection of documentaries, on the PBS Video App and on FRONTLINE\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nThis story has been updated to clarify how Federal Reserve regional bank presidents are chosen."}, {"url": "https://ipwatchdog.com/people/david-kappos/", "page_content": "David Kappos is a Co-Chair of Cravath\u2018s Intellectual Property Practice. He is widely recognized as one of the world\u2019s foremost leaders in the field of intellectual property, including intellectual property management and strategy, the development of global intellectual property norms, laws and practices as well as commercialization and enforcement of innovation-based assets.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2013, Mr. Kappos served as Under Secretary of Commerce and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In that role, he advised the President, the Secretary of Commerce and the Administration on IP policy matters. Mr. Kappos led the Agency in dramatically reengineering its entire management and operational systems and its engagement with the global innovation community. He was instrumental in achieving the greatest legislative reform of the U.S. patent system in generations through passage and implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, signed into law by President Obama in September 2011.\n\nPrior to leading the USPTO, Mr. Kappos held several executive posts in the legal department of IBM, the world\u2019s largest patent holder. From 2003 to 2009, he served as the company\u2019s chief intellectual property lawyer. In that capacity, he managed global intellectual property activities for IBM, including all aspects of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection and exploitation. During his more than 25 years at IBM, he also served in a variety of other roles including litigation counsel and Asia Pacific IP counsel, where he led all aspects of IP protection, including licensing, transactions support and M&A activity for the Asia/Pacific region.\n\nMr. Kappos has received numerous accolades for his contributions to the field of intellectual property, including, among others, the 2014 Global Agenda Council Vision Award for the Intellectual Property Council\u2019s pro bono initiative from the World Economic Forum, the 2014 Jefferson Medal from the New Jersey Intellectual Property Law Association (NJIPLA), the 2013 Board of Director\u2019s Excellence Award from the American Intellectual Property Law Association (AIPLA), the 2013 Champion of Intellectual Property Award from the District of Columbia Bar Association and the 2013 North America Government Leadership Award from Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI).

Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

On Thursday, August 13, David Kappos was sworn in as the Undersecretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. He\u2019s the 52nd person to hold that position since it was established in 1836.\n\nThe appointment and confirmation of Kappos was fairly speedy: only 6 months and 24 days after President Obama\u2019s inauguration. President George W. Bush took almost eleven months to appoint James E. Rogan head of the USPTO in 2001. Bruce Lehman, President Clinton\u2019s first Commissioner of Patents, was sworn in on Aug. 11, 1993.\n\nHow long will Kappos stay? The average term in recent years is between 2-4 years. Jon Dudas, Kappos\u2019 immediate predecessor, served from Jan. 2004 to Nov. 2008 (including 5 months as acting director). James Rogan, President Bush\u2019s first USPTO chief, served barely two years, from Dec. 2001 to Jan. 2004. Q. Todd Dickinson also served just 2 years, Jan. 1, 1999 to Jan. 20, 2001, including almost a year as acting director. Bruce Lehman served from 1993 through the end of 1998, almost 5.5 years.\n\nKappos faces a number of tough challenges including a huge backlog of pending applications, declining revenue due to lower filings and fewer paid maintenance fees, delayed patent reform legislation and disatisfaction among the USPTO\u2019s 6,000 patent examiners.\n\nThe longest serving USPTO directors of the last hundred years were Thomas E. Robertson, who served during the Harding, Coolidge and Hoover administrations from 1921 through 1933, and Conway Coe, who served from 1933 through 1945.

I\u2019m delighted we could all be together for this special occasion and happy we\u2019re not sitting out here in 100 degree heat.\n\nI talked to NOAA earlier to request this pleasant weather\u2014and I want to thank them for coming through.\n\nWe have been looking forward to having David Kappos on board as the new Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nAnd I\u2019m pleased to welcome David\u2019s wife, Leslie Kimball, who\u2019s with us today.\n\nI also want to recognize and thank John Doll for his service as acting under secretary and director.\n\nDavid is taking on a big job, a tough job. Promoting and protecting U.S. inventions, innovation, and creativity directly affects our nation\u2019s welfare and prosperity.\n\nThe founders of America thought providing limited protection for intellectual property important enough to include a provision in Article 1, Section 8, of the Constitution.\n\nThis paved the way for Thomas Edison, Abraham Lincoln. . . Michael Jackson, and millions of others to protect their intellectual property through patents and trademarks.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s no secret that the agency today is facing significant challenges.\n\nPut simply, it takes too long for inventions and new ideas to get intellectual property protection. Right now, the patent application pendency process takes an average of 32 months. First office action takes well over 20 months.\n\nThis has a direct, negative impact on America\u2019s economic competitiveness\u2014creating uncertainty for entrepreneurs and inventors.\n\nWe\u2019ve heard the concerns of America\u2019s innovators. That\u2019s why we are pursuing an extremely aggressive goal of taking the average first office action time down to 10 months\u2014which would be the fastest it\u2019s ever been at the modern day PTO.\n\nOver time, the PTO has not evolved quickly enough to keep up with America\u2019s changing climate of innovation.\n\nPart of the problem has been inconsistent funding and diversion of resources to other government activities that leaves the PTO without the resources they need. We\u2019re working to fix that.\n\nBut we also need to rethink the way we\u2019re doing business so we can unleash the expertise and creativity of the PTO team. There are so many talented people in this office. We just need to knock down the organizational barriers that are preventing the PTO from reaching its full potential.\n\nI pledge to you today that I will spend the political capital necessary to give the PTO the resources they need to succeed.\n\nAnd I am very excited to have someone like David Kappos as a partner in this effort.\n\nDavid is the right man to reboot the PTO. Over his 20 year-career, he has accrued deep knowledge of the patent system and gained broad respect from professionals ranging from the biotech, life sciences and high tech sectors.\n\nMost recently, David was the vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property at IBM.\n\nDavid has served on the boards of directors of a number of professional organizations and held leadership positions in IP law associations in Asia and the United States.\n\nHe also has served as the vice president of the Intellectual Property Owners Association.\n\nDavid received his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California-Davis and his law degree from the University of California-Berkeley.\n\nIt is quite a resum\u00e9. David\u2019s innate grasp of the issues will make him an ideal leader for the PTO. No less important is the strong support that David has already garnered from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. That will be crucially important as we move forward with major reforms in the months ahead.\n\nDavid, you have a hard-working, dedicated team here, and I know you are eager to get to work.\n\nSo, please come forward\u2026and would Leslie also join us."}, {"url": "https://ipwatchdog.com/2010/07/29/a-day-in-the-life-of-david-kappos/id=11808/", "page_content": "On July 19, 2010, I was granted a back stage pass of sorts, for a behind-the-scenes look at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. I had initially requested an interview with Director David Kappos and was given an affirmative response, but then I floated the idea of a three-part series to commemorate the first anniversary of David Kappos leaving the private sector to take the helm at the USPTO. Kappos was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 7, 2009, and formally sworn in by Commerce Secretary Gary Locke on August 13, 2009.\n\nRather than just do an interview, I suggested something different. I had heard from numerous sources at the Patent Office that David Kappos is an extremely hard worker, coming to work by 7:00am and leaving most nights after 7:00pm. I had also heard over and over about his regular evening and weekend e-mail exchanges with his Senior Staff. It was apparent to me that Kappos is not like most political appointees, and unlike many, if not most, of the previous PTO Directors. So I thought it might be particularly interesting to profile a day in the life of David Kappos, much like the President allows certain journalists to do by giving them access to the White House for a day, with an associated tour and interview. Peter Pappas, the Chief Communications Officer and Senior Advisor to Kappos, liked the idea and agreed to work with me to get it scheduled. It was tentatively scheduled for July 20, 2010, but with the Three Track hearings that day it was moved up to Monday, July 19, 2010.\n\nI arrived at the Patent Office as per our agreement at 11:00am. Those familiar with David Kappos, who is referred to as \u201cDave\u201d and sometimes as \u201cDK\u201d at the Office, know he does not start his day at 11:00am; he usually arrives at the office at about 6:45am. He normally takes the Metro to and from work each day from his residence in D.C. and frequently chats with examiners during his commute. Kappos was in Boston the day before our interview, and was to take the first flight out of Boston back to Northern Virginia on the morning of July 19, hence the later than usual start time for my day with the Director. It probably doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to those who know Kappos, but he was restless to get back and instead of taking the first flight out on the 19th he took a late flight on the 18th, and was in his office at 6:50am on July 19. I also learned that his deputy, Sharon Barner, routinely catches a 5 am flight from her hometown of Chicago most Monday mornings so she gets to the office in time to meet with Kappos at 8 am. I am told that Patents Commissioner Bob Stoll and External Affairs Administrator Arti Rai, both key Kappos lieutenants, also keep very long hours. In fact, hard work seems to be the norm on the \u201c10th floor\u201d and this type of dedication to the job seems to be a constant and recurring theme at the USPTO. You will read more about Kappos\u2019 Senior Staff in Part Three of this series, titled Behind the Scenes: The USPTO Senior Staff, which is scheduled to be published on IPWatchdog.com on Wednesday, August 4, 2010.\n\nPlainly put, Kappos is driven and his workload is staggering. He came to the Patent Office with a mission. And as you will hear in my interview with him (which will be Part Two of the series, and which is scheduled to be published on IPWatchdog.com on Monday, August 2, 2010) he treats every day like it could be his last day given that he serves \u201cat the pleasure of the President.\u201d His drive to reform the Patent Office and his nearly frantic work schedule is a testament to his desire to get the job done in whatever length of time he is given at the helm of the Office.\n\nAn example of what I will call Kappos\u2019 \u201cget it done\u201d philosophy was on display during a joint meeting of the IT department and the legal team responsible for writing the Manual of Patent Examining Procedures (MPEP). Sadly, one of the reasons the MPEP is not as useful as it could or should be is because the vendor of the computer platform went out of business and the system they are using cannot be updated from a technical standpoint and it has outlived its usefulness. Kappos and his team have identified a new platform that the IT department has tested and likes, and which is also acceptable to the legal team. During the meeting Commissioner Bob Stoll commented that, upon implementation, a Board decision that is issued today could be in the official copy of the MPEP the next day, which would be an extraordinarily fast turn-around. In any event, as the conversation unfolded Kappos at one point said: \u201cif we are going to fail at something, we prefer to fail fast so we can move on to the next thing.\u201d What Kappos was saying is that he doesn\u2019t want to linger and wait too long to see whether something is going to work. He wants the system put through its paces and a determination made by IT and legal quickly as to whether it is the right platform or not . He wants the decision made with all due speed because if a new platform needs to be adopted he wants that decision made quickly so the PTO can get on with improvements. He does not want the PTO languishing for many months with a platform or system that doesn\u2019t make the departments happy and doesn\u2019t fulfill the needs of the PTO and the applicant community.\n\nAs I spent the day going from meeting to meeting, observing Kappos\u2019 day, meeting the Senior Staff, many of whom I already knew, and talking to everyone, it became clear that this was not an unusual day. Multiple phone calls, one from a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom and another from a law professor at Howard University who is working on a pro bono project and conference, to meeting after meeting. I was told repeatedly by those I encountered that this was a very typical day for Kappos, who keeps moving at a fast pace from the time he enters the building early in the morning until the time he leaves the Office at night. Throughout his busy day, Kappos seems to maintain a low-key and affable management style.\n\nOf course, there will be some who think this was an unrealistic day in the life of David Kappos. While I can\u2019t say with 100% certainty, I can say with certitude that what I saw and what I was told is 100% consistent with what I have heard many times over the last year in countless off the record conversations with examiners and Senior Staff. Kappos is a workaholic who really cares about the patent system and the mission of the USPTO. Whether it is on the record or off the record everyone at the PTO, and those outside but with intimate knowledge of what is going on behind the walls on the 10th floor of the Madison Building, will tell you that everyone at the Office is enthusiastic and that Kappos is a great leader.\n\nWhen I originally started hearing just how great Kappos was from everyone, I was perplexed. It seemed as if he was either exactly what the Patent Office needed or there had been a thorough and complete brainwashing of everyone involved. Neither seemed plausible, although the brainwashing thing seemed more likely to me at first than a Presidential appointment being the perfect man for the job. But no one, and I mean no one, is complaining, and I can tell you that Kappos is getting the most out of his Senior Staff and those managers on lower levels as well. He works a lot and he demands a lot, but his passion seems to be contagious because everyone is working hard and no one complains. Kappos\u2019 leadership style is one that seems to inspire and motivate his senior team. Astonishing really.\n\nThe most common story I hear from those within the Patent Office is that Kappos practically works day and night. While a roughly 7am to 7pm schedule is a lot by government standards, it is not crazy by private sector standards. Kappos was after all, most recently Vice-President in charge of IP at IBM, and managed the largest IP department in the world. But repeatedly I hear about e-mails flying furiously at all hours of the evening and early morning, and all day on Saturday and Sunday. One member of the Senior Staff pulled out his Blackberry to make a point. I had previously been told by someone at the PTO that everyone now has their Blackberry surgically attached to his or her hip because \u201cthe boss is an e-mail fiend.\u201d In any event, this Senior Staff member covered up the subject lines, which were displayed in the middle of the screen and then said, \u201cJust look at the time of the day that these were sent.\u201d When I looked at the screen all that was visible was the name of the sender and the time stamp. As messages were scrolled down it was clear that Kappos and his leadership team swap e-mails with great frequency late into the evenings, even on Saturdays and Sundays until nearly midnight and sometimes even later. Yet no one complains, not even off the record and in private. It seems that everyone believes they are participating in something special, and a few have even told me just that. I even witnessed some throughout the day joking with each other about \u201cbeing out of contact\u201d or \u201cnot responding to e-mails\u201d for a few hours over the weekend. At the same time, one senior staff member commented that Kappos takes the time to respond thoughtfully to each and every e-mail he receives and is always available to meet or confer with his senior staff.\n\nThe other thing that I witnessed worthy of particular note is the fact that throughout the day, in almost every conversation, Kappos weaves certain reminders into discussions. A good example would be what Kappos casually interjected during a discussion with members of the Commissioner\u2019s staff who are engaged in a project to better report actual pendency of patent applications. Pendency is a hot topic in the IP Community and there is general agreement that the traditional method of measuring pendency does not cover all situations. Therefore, Kappos and his patents and communications teams, have been working on a new patent dashboard that will allow the PTO data to be more transparent and accessible. The team is going to use multiple metrics and allow for the information to quickly and easily be displayed through a visual interface or Dashboard. During the \u201cDashboard Meeting\u201d Kappos, speaking of the data, explained: \u201cit is owned by the people of the United States, why wouldn\u2019t we want to let them see it?\u201d Everyone was on the same page, and no one was suggesting the data shouldn\u2019t be seen, but the project seeks to spoon feed users some information and continually allow them to drill down further through sets of data until anyone can, if they are interested, see the raw data. The team is proposing to add three or four new measures of pendency \u2014 for example, to more accurately reflect pendency with RCE\u2019S. Later in the day he casually said to his Senior Staff: \u201cWe are here to serve our country.\u201d Kappos is, indeed, taking transparency to a new and seldom seen level at the USPTO and constantly mindful that, while he works at the pleasure of the President, he works for the American people.\n\nAnother thing noteworthy is that Kappos is a very hands-on leader, who participates in the drafting and editing of documents. He is not merely there to sign Federal Register Notices, although he does indeed sign those Notices. One of the benefits of having someone in the position who is a patent attorney and who is intimately familiar with the patent system is that he can meaningfully participate, draft and edit documents and he routinely does so. Kappos also blogs weekly, both externally and in-house. He is not merely a politician, and frankly it is probably unfair to even consider him a politician. He is a patent attorney and an engineer with deep substantive expertise who just so happens to be running the USPTO, what a novel idea!\n\nIn terms of his management style, I would call Kappos\u2019 style easy, laid back and yet firm. There was never any question as to who in the room was the man in charge, and I suspect an alien from another world could have told who the leader was after observing the meeting for a while. But upon entering the room it would have been difficult in most of the meetings because Kappos did not sit at the visible \u201chead of the table.\u201d He was down-to-earth and cordial with everyone. It seemed time and time again he would want to know what the timetable was for this or that, and those responding would always become a bit uncomfortable and start qualifying. He would allow for this, but would always come back and want a firm answer without any wiggling. To a person they would always respond that they could meet the deadline previously agreed, hoping that would make Kappos happy, which it invariably did. Of course, if it could be done competently but faster, that was his preference in every situation. Like any good leader there were \u201chomework assignments\u201d detailing what he wanted to see next and getting everyone to buy into the next stage.\n\nOne of the meetings I attended was the \u201cBilski Meeting,\u201d which was to finalize and approve the now finalized and published Interim Bilski Guidelines. The meeting was attended by a who\u2019s who of leadership. At this meeting were Director Kappos, Commissioner Bob Stoll, Solicitor Ray Chen, Board of Appeals Chief Judge Michael Fleming, Chief of Staff Drew Hirshfeld, Acting Associate Commissioner for Patent Examination Policy Bob Bahr, Communications Chief Peter Pappas and others. Deputy Director Sharon Barner, who was traveling, phoned in to participate. This was the pretty much the same team that assembled on June 28, 2010, in rapid action form to discuss and agree what initial guidance needed to be sent to the patent examiners as a result of the Supreme Court decision in Bilski v. Kappos. This group discussed and agreed on the preliminary guidance and wanted to get it out quickly to examiners who would have questions. It was decided collectively on June 28, 2010, that the memo would be sent out by Bob Bahr because historically these types of memos are sent to the examining corps by the Associate Commissioner for Patent Examination Policy. However, two senior level meetings were held on the day the Bilski decision came out, and Director Kappos and Commissioner Stoll, as well as Solicitor Ray Chen were deeply involved in drafting the initial guidance. Kappos reportedly cut short a meeting at the White House to return to the office to personally edit and approve the guidance that Stoll, Chen and Bahr drafted with the assistance of Arti Rai.\n\nTruthfully, there was not much substantive debate at the \u201cBilski Meeting,\u201d which seemed more like a \u201cspeak now or forever hold your peace\u201d meeting designed to finalize and sign off on this guidance. For obvious reasons, no legal advice was given or discussed in my presence, per our previous arrangement. The heavy lifting had already been done and Kappos had over the weekend read through the proposed Federal Register Notice one final time, redlined the document throughout and edited the final draft personally, which I am told he does with all Federal Register Notices and memos to the examining corps. So the meeting was to go over the Director\u2019s final edits. It sounded like there had been many drafts from Kappos leading up to this, and everyone in the room was rather jubilant and obviously pleased with the work product they collectively worked together to create. One quasi-substantive suggestion was made, which was to drive home one more time at the beginning of the Notice the fact that Section 101 is a threshold inquiry and examiners should focus on 102, 103 and 112 rejections rather than leaping to 101. All were in agreement saying it was already there, but if it could be made more clear then get it done. The final draft with this minor edit was then to be sent to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. OMB had been kept in the loop throughout and speedy approval was anticipated, which did, in fact, happen. After obtaining OMB approval Kappos signed the Federal Register Notice on July 21, 2010, just two days later, and just over three weeks after the Supreme Court issued the decision.\n\nFinally, one more thing is worthy of noting here and now. While I saw Kappos in many different contexts, in meetings, on the telephone, in the halls and in the USPTO cafeteria, throughout the day one thing seemed to make him satisfied beyond everything else. Late in the day he had a telephone call with Professor Lateef Mtima of Howard University. Professor Mtima is planning a conference for sometime this Fall, likely in September, to focus on providing legal assistance to inventors who have great ideas and inventions but no, or limited, capital to pursue their inventions. Kappos is working hard with several law schools and law firms to create a pro bono program to help those inventors. He talks about how you never know which invention could be the one innovation to create a whole new industry and help create many jobs. He and his staff talk about their responsibility to help those independent inventors who may lack resources, including helping those individuals find reputable legal advice and not fall prey to those in the industry who sometimes take advantage of this segment of the inventing community. In fact, Kappos\u2019 communications team established a bi-weekly newsletter called \u201cInventors Eye\u201d that is designed to be a resource for that community. At the end of this call he exclaimed: \u201cThis has been the best call of the day.\u201d I believed he meant it, and didn\u2019t mean any disrespect to anyone else he spoke with or had meetings with. He was just trying to do good by and for disadvantaged inventors who need pro bono assistance.\n\nWhat a day it was; July 19, 2010."}, {"url": "https://patentlyo.com/patent/2009/08/kappos-sworn-in-as-director.html", "page_content": "David Kappos was sworn in on August 13, 2009 as Director of the USPTO.

I\u2019m here to address the whole list."}, {"url": "https://ipwatchdog.com/2009/08/17/awaiting-kappos-decision-claims-continuations/id=4899/", "page_content": "On Thursday, August 13, 2009, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke conducted a ceremonial swearing-in of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO David Kappos. In his remarks before thousands of employees on the USPTO campus, Secretary Locke said \u201cDavid is taking on a big job\u2026 Promoting and protecting U.S. inventions, innovation and creativity directly affects our nation\u2018s welfare and prosperity.\u201d In his remarks at the ceremony, the New PTO Director took a not so subtle swipe at his predecessors, James Rogan and Jon Dudas, by saying: \u201cTo meet Secretary Locke\u2019s direction to me, I will be HERE at the USPTO. I will minimize overseas travel, and focus domestic travel on listening to the U.S. innovation community and discussing our agenda with them.\u201d The capitalization of the word \u201chere\u201d is found in the official copy of Kappos\u2019 remarks published on the USPTO website. Those familiar with how the Patent Office has run over the last 8 years remember that Rogan, and to a lesser degree Dudas, famously traveled the country and the globe. No doubt anything Kappos can do to demonstrate there is a new Sheriff in town will be welcomed by the patent bar, and all those who rely on the work done by the USPTO to assist them in achieving their business objectives.\n\nNow with Kappos installed at the USPTO all eyes, and rampant speculation, turn to what will become of the claims and continuations rules. As most probably know by now, just over two weeks ago the Department of Justice asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to slow down its en banc consideration of the Judge Cacheris\u2019 famous, or from the PTO point of view \u2013 infamous, decision to preliminarily and then permanently enjoin the USTPO from enforcing the claims and continuations rules that were to go into effect on November 1, 2007. For a chronology through the original 3 judge panel hearing at the Federal Circuit see USPTO v. GSK & Tafas Chronology (published December 3, 2008). Of course, after that was published, the 3 judge panel, with Judge Rader in dissent, awarded a victory to the Patent Office except with respect to the limits on continuations. Perhaps most importantly, this panel decision opined that pretty much whatever the Patent Office wants to do is procedural, even when the promulgated rules substantively affect rights. Of course, this decision was purely ridiculous. Calling an examination support document merely \u201canother document\u201d and likening a hard cap on claims absent an ESD to a statute of limitations shows a complete lack of understanding of patent practice reality. Luckily, the full Federal Circuit decided to rehear the case en banc.\n\nIn a twist that is strange in many ways, the Department of Justice on July 28, 2009, asked the Federal Circuit to hold off on moving forward with the rehearing of the claims and continuations appeal pending the installation and arrival of David Kappos. Specifically, the DOJ filing explained that it would be prudent to hold off and allow Kappos, who had already been nominated, to take position at the USPTO and \u201cdetermine what course the USPTO should take in the future with respect to those rules, including whether to rescind the rules.\u201d I have never seen or heard of such a petition being filed, but the DOJ and the parties agreed that this would be the prudent thing to do. This is something that I have been suggesting for many months, starting at least as early as December 3, 2008, in USPTO v. GSK & Tafas Chronology (see paragraph 2), and then again when I wrote about my Patent Wishes for the New Year (see #5).\n\nShortly into 2009 I started receiving phone calls and e-mails strongly suggesting that I stop encouraging the Patent Office to withdraw the rules and moot the appeal. The prevailing thinking seemed to be that this was the sensible thing to do and that the Patent Office may actually get wise and do just that. Presumably, there were some that thought that the Patent Office might listen to me and consider my suggestions. Obviously, that was not the case and never had any chance of being the case. For reasons I will never fully understand, in this time frame the Patent Office simply thought they knew better and were not about to take suggestions. This elementary school way of dealing with the patent bar was evidenced over and over again, but never more forcefully than when each and every comment received relating the the claims and continuations rules, including all 300+ unique comments and observations, were summarily rejected by the USPTO. I found it both humorous and humbling that there were some who thought the PTO might listen to me.\n\nNotwithstanding, at this point in time it seemed like everyone agreed that the Federal Circuit was going to affirm Judge Cacheris\u2019 ruling, and there were many influential people who wanted to hear what the Federal Circuit had to say about the examination support document, because after all, there was no way that the Federal Circuit could be dupped by the PTO\u2019s arguments that the examination support document was just another document the PTO could legitimately require. PTO General Counsel Toupin even erroneously cited Federal Circuit precedent in the area of inequitable conduct in order to suggest that there would be few if any real concerns associated with preparing and filing an ESD, which some refer to as an \u201cexpress suicide document,\u201d and what I have always called the rope to hang yourself. Luckily Judge Rader called Toupin on this, but ultimately to no avail given Judge Rader\u2019s rational, and dare I say correct, view of the case was out-voted on the panel level. See Oral Arguments Completed.\n\nThen after the 3 judge panel decision erased Judge Cacheris\u2019 scathing rebuke of Patent Office rulemaking, again on April 13, 2009 (see comment #3 \u2013 USPTO Budget Crisis), I once again started saying that the rules should be withdrawn. This was followed on April 23, 2009, when I wrote that if I were the Director of the PTO I would immediately withdraw the rules (see penultimate paragraph) and take the extremely Patent Office friendly opinion announcing virtually everything the PTO could ever want to do is procedural.\n\nThen once the full Federal Circuit decided to rehear the case and vacate the original panel decision, the Patent Office is left like Superman with a bar of kryptonite stuck in his pocket, like Batman without a utility belt or perhaps a gambler who ignored common sense, played recklessly and nevertheless won the jackpot, only to keep playing long enough to lose all winnings and the money brought to the casino in the first place. Yes, it seems that the Patent Office failed to take the words and wisdom of Kenny Rodgers to heart. You absolutely, positively have to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away and know when to run, and the time for running was after the 3 judge panel of the Federal Circuit granted the Patent Office great big awesome genie powers!\n\nIf and when Kappos orders the claims and continuations rules withdrawn I will feel great pleasure in the fact that my suggested course of action from many months ago was finally adopted by the Patent Office. Like so many other times that I have been told I was naive, wrong or embarrassingly incorrect, I will once again prove myself right. I am no visionary, but I do think I look at most things rationally, logically and with a fair amount of common sense. There simply was nothing to be gained by the Patent Office assault on the most commercially relevant innovations that the patent system is supposed to encourage most. There was nothing to be gained by alienating the patent bar, making ridiculous arguments and all the while allowing pendency and the patent backlog to run out of control. There was also no reason to look a gift horse in the mouth when the PTO won a surprise victory in March thanks to Judges Prost and Bryson. So if and when Kappos does what we all are expecting, I will feel some pride and a whole lot of sadness. It didn\u2019t have to come to this, it should never have come to this, but if this is how and why the new Sheriff has been invited into town then maybe in the long run the frustration, pain and needless anxiety will all be worthwhile."}, {"url": "https://www.patentbaristas.com/archives/2009/08/14/david-kappos-sworn-in-as-under-secretary-of-commerce-for-intellectual-property-and-director-of-the-uspto/", "page_content": "(Prepared Remarks)\n\nDavid Kappos\n\nSwearing In Ceremony\n\nAugust 13, 2009\n\nUSPTO\n\nThank you Secretary Locke for your support, for joining today and for your focus on the USPTO and the American IP system.\n\nI also want to thank President Obama for appointing me to this position.\n\nAnd thanks to all of you who came out today during your lunch hour to participate in this event.

Kappos was sworn into service in August 2009 at a time of an unprecedented confluence of challenges for the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). The country was in the midst of a recession and economic downturn that negatively affected the revenues of the user fee funded USPTO; Congress was signaling that passage of a broad patent reform bill was imminent; the USPTO had significant infrastructure, particularly technological, problems; uncertainty about full retention of user fees paid to the USPTO was an ongoing concern; and the user community was unhappy with the office regarding recent USPTO procedural decisions, patent quality, and the ever growing backlog of patent applications awaiting examination.\n\nIn additional to those challenges, Kappos took office during a time when political partisanship and acrimony were at an all-time high and becoming only more contentious and more divided every successive year of Kappos\u2019 tenure. This was the political environment that Kappos started in and had to traverse during his 3 years and 7 months as Under Secretary and Director.\n\nDespite all of these obstacles, sixteen pieces of intellectual property related legislation were signed into law during Director Kappos\u2019 tenure. While some commentators have dubbed the 112th Congress the 'Do Nothing Congress', clearly nothing could be further from fact in regards to patent policy and the USPTO. More legislation was introduced and passed in support of the USPTO during Kappos\u2019 term than at any other time in recent memory. Many of these new laws were major pieces of legislation that have had, and will continue to have, profound effects on the USPTO, inventors, businesses, and the national economy. These achievements include: The Foreign and Economic Espionage Penalty Enhancement Act; The Patent Law Treaties Implementation Act; The Trademark Technical and Conforming Amendment Act; The Indian Arts and Crafts Amendments Act; The United States Patent and Trademark Office Supplemental Appropriations Act; The America COMPETES Re-Authorization Act; The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act; and The Leahy-Smith America Invents Technical Correction Act.\n\nSuch a result was unthinkable at the August 7, 2009 confirmation of David Kappos, a business executive with no Administration or Capitol Hill experience.
