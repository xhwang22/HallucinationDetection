{"Carpenter wrote for the BBC's Armchair Theatre and ITV's The Avengers.": [{"url": "https://televisionheaven.co.uk/articles/the-armchair-theatre-effect", "page_content": "When commercial television began in September 1955 ATV tried to compete on the same level as the BBC's drama output by offering its viewers fragments of Oscar Wilde and Noel Coward (on Rediffusion's opening night) and the 30-minute Theatre Royal, the first ITV play series which began broadcasting on 25th September, 1955, with a televised Dickens episode, Bardell v Pickwick. The series was produced by Harry Alan Towers' independent Towers of London Productions company for ITC. Also on offer was London Playhouse a series which drew on the standard West End fare that was on offer at the time.\n\nHoward Thomas\n\nPioneered by Howard Thomas and launched by ABC television in 1956 with the play The Outsider starring David Kossoff, Armchair Theatre would have a more lasting impact. Thomas had previously been a journalist, an advertising man and a BBC producer (he created The Brains Trust), and came to television following a long period in charge of documentary films for Associated British Pathe, where he produced the Coronation film Elizabeth is Queen. Dennis Vance produced Armchair Theatre for two years. Born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, Vance began his career as an actor in the late 1940s, before switching to become a producer with the BBC in the early 1950s. He left the Corporation in 1955 to produce The Adventures of the Scarlet Pimpernel (1955-56) for Towers of London Productions, before becoming the first Head of Drama at Associated British Corporation (ABC). That first Armchair Theatre presentation played to an audience of 390,000 homes (audience figures were measured in homes rather than viewers in the 1950s. The 'average viewers' was regarded as 2.4 per home. About 51% of homes were equipped to receive ITV at that time).\n\nLeonard White, later to become producer of Armchair Theatre says that it was the second presentation in the first series that started to establish the programme's mainstream commitment to commissioning original TV drama scripts with a double-bill of new works. The Handshake starring Rosalie Crutchley, Anton Diffring and Billie Whitelaw, was written by Peter Key and directed by Stuart Latham. The same cast acted in Duncan Greenwood's Bid for Fame. In that first season 41 single-play productions were made.\n\nThe Armchair Theatre series began to gain ground in 1958 with the arrival of Canadian producer Sydney Newman and his commissioning of scripts from some of the most promising young talents in the country. Newman took over from Vance (following the latter's decision to go free-lance) as Drama Supervisor for ABC Television in April 1958. In Autumn of that year he embarked on a plan to make Armchair Theatre as far as possible an all-British programme with every play specially written for the series.\n\n\"One must know who the audience is and, when dealing in millions, this is no easy thing. A tiny part of this mass audience who know something of the theatre, who have some knowledge of art, literature and history, would not be hard to please. When in doubt, give them Ibsen. \"From the director's point of view, Ibsen is a piece of cake. He has seen his plays performed many times before. And of course, so have the critics. But this is academic because, in fact, I have to win and hold a vast audience from every walk of life and that is a far greater and more exciting challenge. To win approval without pandering to 'idiot' level is achievement enough for any man, particularly because the majority of this audience (12 million average) would never go to the theatre even if it were gratis with free beer in the intervals. \"This vast audience may not have time to wait for Godot (no offence to Beckett), but those who would call them unintelligent on this count would be making a mistake. In fact, intelligence may have little to do with the enjoyment of a play. To satisfy the television audience may be a lot harder than to amuse pleasure-seeking and uncritical goers to a West End play. The theatre and cinema public, having made the effort to be parted with their money, become part of a captive audience. But the great TV audience is held by nothing but its own likes and dislikes. By the twist of a knob they can remove themselves from the 'theatre' without the embarrassment of a stumble over feet and a whispered \"Excuse me!\" \"In one of our recent plays, owing to a flubby opening, 2,700,000 people from Land's End to John O'Groats, gave us 'the bird' by flicking off within the first seven minutes. No captive audience this!\"\n\n- Sydney Newman writing in \"The Armchair Theatre\" 1959.\n\nLeonard White says that the style of drama adopted by ABC was largely due to a strong Canadian influence even before Newman arrived. It started with Ted Kotcheff's arrival from CBC in Toronto. \"He was a prime example of the unique style of a television drama director who had learned by doing the job at the Jarvis Street studios of CBC. One of the group who came to television unfettered by preconceptions. They regarded television as a completely new medium, special unlike any other. Whereas in the UK the general influence on television drama in the early years was from the theatre, and in the USA from cinema, in Canada there was no such strong single preconditioning.\" It was Kotcheff who helped Howard Thomas lure Sydney Newman from CBC.\n\nSydney Newman talks to actress Mary Peach during rehearsals for 'Inside Story', an Armchair Theatre presentation.\n\nWhen Newman arrived in England he immediately picked up on the 'class system' that was an inherent part of everyday life, and which also spilled over into the theatre as well as television drama. \"The only legitimate theatre was of the 'anyone for tennis' variety, which, on the whole, presented a condescending view of working-class people. Television dramas were usually adaptations of stage plays, and invariably about upper classes. I said 'Damn the upper-classes -they don't even own televisions!'\n\nLeonard White remembers that Newman started out conventionally enough with \"a few thrillers, a mystery and a medical drama. But soon the tag 'domestic drama' became a running theme - and with Ray Rigby's Boy with the Meat Axe in November 1958, Armchair Theatre began to be dubbed 'kitchen sink drama'. As television was becoming the popular form of communication so Sydney Newman set about getting the weekly drama diet to reflect day to day life of the populace and social issues of that time. Sydney honed in on naturalistic dialogue. Not for him the oh-so-English Shakespearean delivery by actors competing to out-play Gielgud or Olivier.\"\n\nNewman's approach to abandon established dramas and go for a gritty realism resulted in a series of specially commissioned plays by young playwrights such as Harold Pinter, Robert Miller, Ray Rigby and Alun Owen. \"My approach,\" said Newman, \"was to cater for the people who were buying low cost things like soap every day. The ordinary blokes the advertisers were aiming at.\" It was a policy that paid dividends for the both ABC TV and the viewer. The wealth of talent employed both in front and behind the cameras read like a who's who of the British entertainment industry as the weekly dramas reached the top ten ratings for 32 out of 37 weeks between 1959 and 1960. Pinter's first TV play during that period was A Night Out, and was followed that same year by Owen's Lena, O My Lena, which starred Billie Whitelaw and Peter McEnery in a terse story of a Liverpool student who falls in love with a factory worker. However, the classics were not completely abandoned and the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald (The Last Tycoon) and Oscar Wilde (The Picture of Dorian Gray) were also adapted for television. Other productions included Canadian author Mordecai Richler's own teleplay of his The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz and Z Cars creator Ted Willis's Hot Summer Night.\n\nSidney Newman is seated in his booth whilst the director and his assistants keep a watchful eye on the monitor screens during the transmission of an Armchair Theatre production.\n\nNewman's penchant for gritty realism, focusing on what he described as \"real issues\", led to the series being dubbed in class-conscious Britain as 'Armpit Theatre'. Unfortunately it is difficult to assess the quality of many of these early transmissions due to the fact that they went out live (a practice that was cruelly highlighted in 1958 when the actor Gareth Jones collapsed and died in front of the viewing audience during the play 'Underground'), and, unlike their American counterparts, these performances were not preserved on film for future generations.\n\nBy the end of the decade there was the first glimpse that the feelings of mistrust that existed in the serious theatre for television would be put aside in, initially, a grudging alliance. With the influence of television growing ever stronger and the opportunity for regular work presenting itself to many of the acting profession, it was becoming harder to ignore the pull of the new medium. However, there was still a great deal of resistance towards television, which had led many \"serious professionals\" to shun or simply dismiss \"the box\" as a passing fad. There was almost certainly something of a conspiracy amongst a select few to avoid television at all costs. What serious actor would want to stake their reputation, built up during a long and distinguished career, on one critical performance? It was a risk not considered worth taking at that time, although each of these professionals would be keeping a very cautious eye on events, acknowledging television could not be ignored for much longer, and knowing that they would eventually be drawn to it with great inevitability.\n\nDennis Vance directing an Armchair Theatre production.\n\nIn 1959 the barriers were finally broken when arguably the theatres leading light, Sir Laurence Olivier, made what was described as an \"electrifying television debut\" in Ibsen's John Gabriel Borkman. And with the removal of that barrier the floodgates opened. Sir John Gielgud made his debut alongside Gladys Cooper, Margaret Leighton, Roger Livesey and Megs Jenkins in A Day by the Sea. It was one of the most impressive cast lists ever assembled for a single play, let alone a television broadcast.\n\nSir Michael Redgrave appeared in the moving role of a schoolmaster in N.C. Hunter's A Touch of the Sun, a part that had previously won him \"Actor of the Year\" in 1958. And this encouraged others to recreate their stage roles for television, as did Robert Helpmann, when he transferred his great success in the West End production of Noel Coward's comedy Nude With Violin to the small screen. ATV signed Peter Draper to write exclusively for them and his first play, The Paraguayan Harp starred Maurice Denham. His next play, Sunday Out of Season, the story about a romance in a small seaside town, starred Maggie Smith, who also gave a memorable performance in A Phoenix Too Frequent alongside George Cole. As well as the now well-known names to appear in the cast lists a number of celebrated authors figured amongst the credits too. Thornton Wilder's famous story The Bridge of San Luis Rey was presented as the first play of 1959 and starred Diane Cilento. Poking fun at convention and society was both Ian Hay and L. du Garde Peach who collaborated in The White Sheep of the Family, a lightweight comedy about a family who owe their comfortable living to their combined talents as pickpockets, burglars and forgers.\n\nEdward Judd and Harry H. Corbett in John Wexley's prison drama 'The Last Mile' (1957).\n\nJean Anouilh's The Traveller Without Luggage took more than 25 years to reach the British stage, but considerably less time to make it onto television, adapted and directed by Casper Wrede the play featured Keith Michell and Michael Gough. By the end of 1959 ATV had produced a vintage year for television drama and along with the rest of its output was going from strength to strength. The following year it was announced that the channel would be ousting all cinema feature films from the weekend TV schedule, in what was described at that time as a \"revolutionary step\". Val Parnell explained at the time the reason for that decision:\n\n\"Our combined programme resources now make it possible for us to bring more live productions and several new TV film series from Britain, Australia and American studios.\" One of the first results of this new policy was the screening of 'Theatre 70', a series of 70-minute plays, all concentrating on a suspense theme and spawned by a series of plays called 'Suspense' that had been well received earlier in the year. At that time one of Parnell's partners, ITC board member Lew Grade would almost certainly have one eye on possible US sales, and the first play featured Robert Horton, better known for his role as Flint McCullough in 'Wagon Train'.\n\nAs drama series' gathered in reputation so they attracted some of British theatre's best-known faces and names such as Flora Robson, Gracie Fields, Joan Greenwood, Charles Gray, and Donald Pleasance. Lesser-known names, debuting in British television drama, would go on to enjoy long and distinguished careers and these included Alan Bates, Tom Courtney and Diana Rigg.\n\nActors William Russell and Maggie Smith in a 1959 Arrmchair Theatre production, 'Girl on the Beach'.\n\n1958 and 1959 were clearly pivotal years for British television, and the following decade would be fondly remembered as the true golden age of quality television drama. More so than at any other time in the medium's history, the 1960s would establish itself as the decade during which the one-off drama truly came of age on British television screens.\n\nIn 1962, Sydney Newman suddenly left ABC to take up the role of Head of Drama for the BBC. Leonard White believes that decision may have been influenced by changes at ABC that Newman was not happy with. Brian Tesler, who had been brought in to develop Light Entertainment', had become Programme Controller. Whereas Howard Thomas had been happy with ABC being the major provider of drama for the ITV Network, leaving Lew Grade's ATV as the main provider of LE, the emphasis was now about to shift. As a result, and while Newman was on holiday, ABC lost the weekly 'Armchair Theatre' slot to a fortnightly only slot. When Newman quit (he was so incensed that he even took a drop in salary at the BBC) he was replaced at ABC by Leonard White who went on to produce 165 teleplays up until 1969. White, the original producer of The Avengers who had cast Honor Blackman in the role of Cathy Gale, was also trained at CBC in Toronto.\n\nAt the BBC Sydney Newman set about revamping the Drama Department into three separate units: Plays, Series and Serials. One of his first priorities was to revive the BBC's reputation for serious drama which was at its lowest level in eight years. In September 1963 Newman launched First Night, a series of new plays written especially for television. Alun Owen's The Strain and Simon Raven's The Scapegoat were among the notable dramas produced between 1963 and 1964. But it wasn't until Newman launched The Wednesday Play that the BBC's fortunes began to turn around. With dramas from Dennis Potter, John Hopkins, David Mercer, Jeremy Sandford, David Rudkin, Jim Allen, Tony Parker, Nell Dunn, and Colin Welland, The Wednesday Play was to have an even greater impact than Armchair Theatre.\n\nBritish television, in parallel with the emergence and rapid growth of the serious drama form on American television screens of the latter part of the 1950s and for much of the 1960s, was closely associated with quality productions, and laid the roots for dramatic presentations that continually broke new ground, as with plays like Stand Up, Nigel Barton and Vote, Vote, Vote for Nigel Barton, Up the Junction and the oft-mentioned Cathy Come Home. Through these years and into the following decades it also brought us the work of many gifted writers and left us with many memorable performances; Patricia Hayes in Edna, The Inebriate Woman, Alison Steadman in Abigail's Party, Nigel Hawthorn in the Jack Rosenthal play The Knowledge, John Hurt in The Naked Civil Servant, Mike Leigh's comedy Nuts in May and Alan Bennet's An Englishman Abroad, have all placed themselves indelibly into the annals of television history, as proved when each of them was named in the British Film Institutes top 100 programmes of all time, which was compiled at the turn of the millennium.\n\nThrough strands such as Armchair Theatre, The Wednesday Play and Play for Today, the single drama consolidated its position as not only the worthy equal of its traditional theatrical counterpart, but also established itself beyond question as an immensely powerful and relevant mirror to the swiftly changing social evolution of the nation at large.\n\n\n\nHistory and Notes:\n\nWhen Independent Television began in 1955 American comedy series like 'I Love Lucy' topped the TV ratings poll; then came the quizzes with extravagant prizes; then the boom in Westerns. Lavish variety shows, better produced than ever before, topped the ratings in the early years, but even the most intrepid acrobats and the most gravity-defying jugglers wore out their welcome, so that there was only room at the top for big-scale, big-name shows like 'Sunday Night at the London Palladium'.\n\nThrough all this, plays remained high in public demand. In the ten most popular programmes in any week, you were certain to find a play or two. Britain liked its drama and was prepared to sit down almost every night of the week to 'a good play'.\n\nFor this, much credit must go to the BBC. The Corporation had always given drama an important place in its schedules, from the days of Val Gielgud's radio plays to Michael Barry's regime in television (this will be covered in another article). Even when television budgets were skimpy the BBC allocated generously to drama, encouraging writers, training directors and technicians. All this pioneering was rewarded by the standard of television drama and the response of the audience.\n\nIndependent Television first took the bulk of that audience away from the BBC by putting on more acceptable light entertainment, but the real battle between the two channels was in the field of drama. The BBC's powerful, large and firmly-established Drama Department was presenting three plays of a generally high standard week after week. But when the Drama Departments in the Independent Television Companies came into life they flourished and prospered until they overtook and outpaced the BBC's output. By the late 1950s, almost without exception, the audiences with a choice between a play on BBC or ITA were choosing the ITA play on a ratio of three to one.\n\nITA plays were regarded as lighter and livelier because of the BBC's policy of presenting the whole range of drama, from farce to classics, in their entirety. The viewer preferred the ITA's one-hour play as part of a varied evenings viewing whereas the BBC productions ran into two and three hours, demanding attention and concentration for most of the evening. Not that the ITA play departments had left the serious field to the BBC, for some of the most vigorous and exciting revivals of Ibsen and Strindberg came from the independent channels, along with some of the most serious and controversial plays of the contemporary theatre.\n\n- Adapted from the 1959 ABC Television publication 'The Armchair Theatre', a comprehensive book on the television play intended for \"all those wishing to make a contribution to this new art\", the above article is made up of contributions from Howard Thomas, Managing Director of ABC Television Limited, the company that presented 'Armchair Theatre'. The establishment of 'AT' was the result of Thomas's conviction that the play was the principal common denominator in family television entertainment. Producer-Director Dennis Vance also pioneered the series.\n\n\n\nShare\n\nPublished on February 19th, 2019.

It didn\u2019t quite do that, but it did perform one useful service: getting the under-thirties into the stalls. This demographic shift was helped by the transmission of one of the play\u2019s cleaner passages as a BBC television \u2018Theatre Flash\u2019, alerting the chattering youth to the presence of something other than genteel matinees for scone-munching Aunt Ednas. A long and fruitful alliance between TV and the modern stage was born.\n\nAnother TV beneficiary was The Birthday Party, a drama of nameless persecution in a south coast bed and breakfast, written by jobbing actor Harold Pinter during a 1957 tour of Doctor in the House. Disastrous notices on its London debut threatened it with early closure until the Sunday Times praised it to the skies, but it took a production directed by Joan Kemp-Welch on peak-time ITV for it to reach ten million viewers. Many viewers took against its obscurity (\u2018We are still wondering what it was all about and why we didn\u2019t switch it off\u2019).73 Others had their eyes opened to \u2018a Picasso in words\u2019, something new and wonderfully different from the usual tea-table crosstalk. While many found it disturbing, one viewer reported \u2018loving every word \u2026 of the author\u2019s uproarious nonsense\u2019.74 After transmission, the ever-helpful press department of the Tyne-Tees region became so overwhelmed by inquiries it issued a fact-sheet offering a \u2018reasonable and interesting interpretation\u2019 of the play. Existential drama had joined the mainstream.\n\nITV\u2019s main dramatic showcase at the time was Armchair Theatre. Initially a ragbag of classics and light comedies, it was remoulded by incoming Canadian producer Sydney Newman in 1958 to reflect the new theatrical mood of contemporary social engagement. (Newman\u2019s archetypal idea of an armchair play involved a small-time grocer threatened by a new supermarket.)75 Many new writing talents would be discovered or nurtured by Newman, and Pinter joined their ranks on 24 April 1960 with his first original television work, A Night Out.\n\nThe nocturnal jaunt is made by diffident office worker Albert Stokes (Tom Bell) escaping from the home of his pathetically possessive widowed mother. The works do he attends ends in disaster when he\u2019s mischievously accused of groping a secretary. He flees, ending up in a deeply uncomfortable encounter with a hooker (Pinter\u2019s then wife, Vivien Merchant), who affects a cartoon poshness. (\u2018You\u2019ve not got any cigarettes on you? I\u2019m very fond of a smoke. After dinner with a glass of wine. Or before dinner \u2026 with sherry.\u2019) They almost start to bond over their shared tragic isolation, but when she asks him too many questions, in a manner too like his own mum, Stokes spectacularly falls apart. With nothing in his social armoury between taciturn gaucheness and inarticulate rage, Stokes proves himself completely incapable of starting a life outside the suffocating maternal evenings of gin rummy and shepherd\u2019s pie: not so much Angry Young Man as Awkward Old Boy. Osborne\u2019s threatened men ranted with theatrical garrulousness. More appropriately for the small screen, Pinter\u2019s Stokes agonises in silent close-up.\n\nThe mysterious, spectral characters that were Pinter\u2019s trademark were perhaps unsuited to Armchair Theatre\u2019s bread-\u2019n\u2019-scrape naturalism. (Stokes certainly shows none of the buried redeeming features a social realist anti-hero usually possesses.) But his sheepishly combative dialogue fitted perfectly with Newman\u2019s mission statement, sketching a repressed lower-middle-class claustrophobia heightened by director Philip Saville\u2019s endlessly burrowing cameras. For extra realism, the coffee stall where Stokes meets his workmates was John Johnson\u2019s famous all-night concession, normally found outside the Old Vic but shifted to the studio for the occasion.76\n\nThough it wasn\u2019t Pinter\u2019s greatest work, A Night Out was a solid hit, reaching 6.38 million. Three days after it aired, Pinter joined the theatrical aristocracy as The Caretaker opened to prodigious acclaim, but he calculated that the play would have to run at the Duchess Theatre until 1990 to get the exposure A Night Out caught in one go.77 As well as plays, Pinter\u2019s subsequent TV work spanned everything from The Dick Emery Show to Pinter People, a collection of sketches animated by Sesame Street alumnus Gerald Potterton. This was for the psychedelic series NBC Experiment in Television, which gave US network time over to the imaginations of everyone from Tom Stoppard to Jim Henson.\n\nBy the end of 1960 the all-purpose avant-garde TV play had become such a part of the broadcasting landscape it was ripe for parody. The writer hero of Joan Morgan\u2019s Square Dance toiled away at a modishly obscure drama called Ending\u2019s No End, featuring a Greek chorus of Teddy boys and the cast turning radioactive in the final act.78 The joke relied on every viewer having at one time switched off something by Pinter or his contemporaries in confusion and disgust. What it ignored was the significant portion who kept watching.\n\n\u0414\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0442 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0444\u0440\u0430\u0433\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c.\n\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0420\u0435\u0441"}, {"url": "https://www.memorabletv.com/tv/armchair-theatre-itv-1956-1974-2/", "page_content": "Hugely important ITV anthology of single plays, Armchair Theatre really came into it\u2019s own under the leadership of Canadian producer Sydney Newman who brought the same sense of kitchen sink realism to the small screen that was then currently cutting a swathe across British cinema and theatre.\n\nVia Newman there was a steady stream of contemporary productions featuring work from the likes of Alun Owen (who would go on to write the screenplay for the first Beatles movie A Hard Days Night) and Robert Muller.\n\nIn 1963 the BBC poached Newman and his story editing team of Irene Shubik and Peter Luke \u2013 an act which would pay dividends for the BBC with the arrival soon after of The Wednesday Play and then Play For Today.

Broadcaster and author. Carpenter was a radio broadcaster best remembered as the award-winning biographer of such famous figures as J. R. R. Tolkien, Ezra Pound, and W. H. Auden. Attending the Dragon School at Oxford University, he earned an M.A. followed by a Dip.Ed., which he had pursued while considering a profession as a teacher. Instead of becoming an educator, however, he joined the British Broadcasting Corporation after university as a trainee in 1968. Carpenter soon proved himself a talented broadcaster and producer. He was a staff producer for BBC Radio Oxford during the early 1970s, becoming a freelance writer and broadcaster in 1975. Among the programs he worked on for the BBC as a freelancer were the show In Tune, for which he was a presenter, and Night Waves, which aired on Radio 3. He also enjoyed producing children's theater and was a prolific book reviewer for publications such as the Times Literary Supplement. Carpenter desired to be a successful novelist; however, he discovered his real talents lay in biography and children's stories. One of his most successful projects was Tolkien: A Biography (1977), for which he was able to draw on the resources of Tolkien's family, whose members he knew personally. A related book, The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams, and Their Friends (1979), received the Somerset Maugham Award. Other award winners produced by Carpenter were W. H. Auden: A Biography (1981), which was a Los Angeles Times best biography, earned the 1984 E. M. Forster Award, and was nominated for the Whitbread Award; A Serious Character: The Life of Ezra Pound (1988), which won the Duff Cooper Prize; and Benjamin Britten, which received the Royal Philharmonic Society Award. During the 1980s and 1990s Carpenter wrote a popular series of children's books featuring a friendly wizard named Mr. Majeika. In addition to his biographies, he edited two collections of Tolkien's letters, published two surveys of children's literature with his wife, Mari Prichard, and more recently published That Was Satire, That Was: Beyond The Fringe, The Establishment Club, Private Eye, That Was the Week That Was (2000) and The Angry Young Men: A Literary Comedy of the 1950s (2002). When not writing or working on the radio, Carpenter pursued music interests and was founder of the band Vile Bodies, which performed music from the 1920s and 1930s.

Other TV shows in which he appeared in the 1960s included Z-Cars, Dixon of Dock Green and Gideon's Way.\n\nIn 1969, Carpenter created Catweazle, the children's series about an unfortunate wizard from the 11th century who is accidentally transported to the present day. This changed the course of his career substantially. Carpenter earned international recognition and a Writers' Guild award for creating the cult children's TV series.\n\nDuring the 1970s, he wrote the series The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976\u20131978), Dick Turpin (1979\u20131982), parts of the series The Famous Five and Doctor Snuggles, and 17 episodes of The Adventures of Black Beauty for ITV; and Cloud Burst, The Boy from Space and The King's Dragon as part of BBC's Look and Read (1967\u20132004) programme for schools, some episodes of which he also presented.\n\nIn the 1980s came the historical adventures Smuggler and its later antipodean-based follow-up Adventurer and between them, the lavish HTV production Robin of Sherwood, which ran for three series. Carpenter then worked on a number of series for children and families in the 1990s (The Winjin' Pom, Stanley's Dragon and Out of Sight), some of which (The Borrowers, The Return of the Borrowers and The Scarlet Pimpernel) were based on classic novels.\n\nCarpenter wrote novelisations of many of the early series he created: Catweazle, Cloud Burst, The Ghosts of Motley Hall, Smuggler, Robin of Sherwood (two books) and two books of Dick Turpin.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCarpenter married Annabelle Lee in 1954. They had two children and remained married until his death.\n\nDeath\n\nOn 26 February 2012, at the age of 82, Carpenter died in Hertfordshire from a pulmonary embolism.\n\nFilmography\n\nTarnished Heroes (1961) - Freddy\n\nH.M.S.

What's the first thing you think of when you hear the words 'Armchair Theatre?' It might be an actor or a writer, perhaps even the title of a play or the memories you associate with it \u2013 fond or otherwise, but it's more likely to be one important and often elusive trait: quality. This immediate, often knee-jerk association is particularly apt, since that's exactly what ITV were striving for when working to bring the series off the drawing board and into the homes of mid-1950s Britain. Already gaining a larger audience share than BBC for it's popular Saturday programming, such as Sunday Night at the London Palladium, ITV set out to prove the commentators who believed commercial television would bring down the tone and standard of the television as a whole (some would argue that pronouncement is a prophetic one) wrong by commissioning a prestige drama series to parallel those of their Public Service Broadcasting rivals. Even in these early years, this route was a tried and tested one, and ITV had made early attempts to reach that loftier ambition in the form of Theatre Royal (1955-1956) and TV Playhouse (1955-63). While these series were successful \u2013 especially in the case of the latter, thanks to the combined skill of writers Dennis Potter and Alan Sharp, the first anthology drama series to make its mark on television history was in fact Armchair Theatre. What would ultimately become a landmark in British television and the jewel in ITV's crown thanks to its innovations in production and style had a rather more conventional beginning. Conceived by Howard Thomas (a former producer for the BBC) the series was launched by ABC television in 1956, with Dennis Vance's 'The Outsider.' Vance previously worked on both Theatre Royal and TV Playhouse, and remained working on the programme for two years, taking up the position of producer. Sadly, much of the plays from Vance's time on the series have been lost, but were predominantly adaptations of high-brow literature and theatrical sources ranging from Ibsen to Strindberg alongside original work from emergent British writing talent. This new era for the series was ushered in by Ted Willis' (creator of Dixon of Dock Green amongst seminal projects) groundbreaking interracial romance 'Hot Summer Night,' in 1959, appropriately coinciding with a similar new wave for British cinema, also defined by it's social realist roots. Though Newman and his team attracted young directorial and writing talent, including Ted Kotcheff, Philip Saville, Charles Jarrott, Alun Owen, Ray Rigby, Clive Exton and Angus Wilson, often in their first work for television, the inherent risk in taking them on was greatly reduced by the privileged position Armchair Theatre occupied in the schedule, following the aforementioned Sunday Night at the London Palladium, giving an outlet to writers which would otherwise have no way of reaching an audience of any kind. A notable case-in-point is Harold Pinter, whose stage work had somewhat alienated critics. The airing of his first work for television, 'A Night Out' would not only connect with audiences, but manage the unprecedented feat of being the top rated programme in the TAM ratings for the entire week. When it fully embraced this home-grown strand of its output became its hallmark, Armchair Theatre came into its own during 1958, and under Canadian producer Sidney Newman (poached from CBC to head the ABC's drama department) as it began to cater less for the upper classes and more for the man in the street, fitting with Newman's admiration for socially relevant, realistic drama, which would play an influential role on the look, feel and content of the anthology the years to come. In fact, this aesthetic became so typical; it led to series being given the rather unfortunate moniker of 'Armpit Theatre' by critics. Though it may have been an amusing joke, it's also a misconception; since Newman ensured that the production's remained diverse in both genre and style, spawning the first of the programme's spin-offs with Out of This World (1962) and Armchair Mystery Theatre (1960; 1964-65). Ever attuned to the changing needs of his audience, Newman announced that there would be \"no more plays about 'kitchen sinks', unless they are brilliant,\" and continued to provide a diverse output of plays (including those with social realist roots) until his departure for the BBC in 1963. Ironically, Newman's successor Leonard White, (formerly producer of both Out of This World and Armchair Mystery Theatre, as well as the early episodes of The Avengers (1961-69), would be somewhat eclipsed by his predecessor, both in terms of legacy, and his continued work at the BBC, primarily in the form of The Wednesday Play (1964-70), which would ultimately take Armchair Theatre's place as an example of cutting-edge drama. However, the series still produced important and influential plays such as David Mercer's 'A Way of Living,' Donald Churchill's 'The Hothouse,' whilst continuing to attract high-calibre writing, directorial and acting talent, providing the springboard for spy drama Callan. In its latter years, helmed by Lloyd Shirley, now produced by Thames, the series would struggle against criticism that the television play was a dying form. At that time, Armchair Theatre's very name \u2013 which was once lauded as the gold standard, to which all other dramas should aspire \u2013 was now an outdated reminder of theatrical roots that television had seemingly outgrown. The series' eighteen years on the air came to an end in 1974, and was revived in the form of various spin-offs in the form of Armchair Cinema (which aired Ian Kennedy Martin's 'Regan' the forerunner to landmark drama The Sweeney in its first series) and Armchair Thriller (first used in 1967) for an anthology suspense dramas (1978-80). The passage of time has allowed Armchair Theatre's value to our television, social and cultural history to appreciate, and as its modern predecessors prove, is more than by no means a dying breed and is more than equal to its theatrical equivalent. However, without the work of all those involved with the creation of Armchair Theatre programmes such as BBC's Afternoon Play would not have been possible, and as such remains a shining example of the unique position the single drama occupies in those historical contexts. Allowed the most intimate from of exhibition \u2013 our home \u2013 it is both a part and a reflection of our constantly evolving nation and all the people in it. Though its fortunes may have changed over the years, the quality and importance of this seminal anthology is undeniable. the dvd Following on from Network's superb classic television release of The Prisoner, this first volume of plays concentrates on Armchair Theatre's later years, and is as much about archiving the material as it is presenting it for the purposes of entertainment. In spite of the sheer vastness of the anthology's output, much of it is lost. As previously mentioned, much of the formative years of the anthology's vast output have been lost, and recording of the plays wasn't instituted until 1958, in the aftermath of the sudden death of actor Gareth Jones, partway through his performance in James Forsyth's 'Underground.' From this standpoint alone, Network should be commended, since this set makes a valuable and important contribution toward keeping our rich and diverse television alive and, perhaps most importantly of all, accessible, whether you want to view it for the purposes of nostalgia or for academic study. The set contains eight plays first broadcast between 1970 and 1973, shown here in their entirety and without having to suffer the ad breaks (however, the intertiles denoting the start and end of each act remain). Each one can be selected and viewed on its own or alternatively, you can use the 'play all' feature to watch them consecutively in the order they appear below. Disc One Say Goodnight to Your Grandma [1970] (53:07) Written by and starring Collin Welland, this BAFTA award winning drama was the main draw for me in regards to this set, and it's no stretch to say that it's worth the purchase price on it's own. Returning home with his wife Jean (Susan Jameson) and baby daughter Cressida, Tony (Welland) is a man caught between the proverbial rock and hard place, contending with the demands of his wife, mother and proud new grandma 'Nana' (Madge Ryan) as well as mother-in-law Mrs 'Grannie' Clark (Mona Bruce), during a 'meeting of the matriarchs.' As the women try to stake their claim, tensions escalate, causing Tony to retreat to his past, bringing his childhood friends Harry (Ralph Watson), Ken (Ron Davies), Eric (Colin Edwynn), Phil (Duggie Brown) and Ray (Jack Smethurst) home for an impromptu celebration, much to delight of Nana and the dismay of Jean, until she decides to teach them all a lesson they're unlikely to forget. At its heart, Grandma is about the struggle to balance the 'new' and 'old' parts of ourselves, our lives, and all the people in it, this is a wonderfully written piece with a light comedic touch to balance out the more emotionally-charged moments, delivered by a strong cast. It's easy to see why it garnered attention from BAFTA. The play's opening moments, which explain Tony's travel plans in the form of letters between Tony and Nana (shown superimposed on top of family photographs and read in voice over by Welland and Ryan), are a particularly nice touch. Clearly influenced by social realist drama and the much-loved television staple of the soap opera (or serial drama for the purists), like many of the other plays in Armchair Theatre's output, Grandma has a warmth and a familiarity about it, if you don't know people like Tony and his family, you probably are like them. Immensely enjoyable.\n\nOffice Party [1971] (50:31) At a very different stage in his life to Grandma's Tony, soon-to-retire bank manager Mr Moore (George A. Cooper) works through his last day while his colleagues organise a farewell party in his honour. Written by Fay Weldon (under the pseudonym Laurence Wells), I don't think it's a coincidence that his character is presented as something of a dying breed, exemplary of the British stiff-upper lip, he's a full of pride and a stickler for rules, but all too aware the world around him is changing, and his time is running out, and those around him are in search of 'new blood.' It gives everything here a bittersweet, almost foreboding feel, which is entirely outside of the concept of taking retirement. The underlying theme of uncertain futures, further reflected in the storylines of the other bank employees including incoming manager Dickie (Peter Barkworth), young expectant mum Julia (Angharad Rees), her boyfriend Paul (Ray Brooks) and their customers seem particularly poignant in our current economic climate. This is proof, if any were required, that while some TV drama can all too easily show it's age \u2013 though it's not to say that this isn't also an artefact of life in Brittan circa 1971 \u2013 and look outdated, others can really transcend the time period they were made in and remain relevant to a modern audience Suffice to say, I think that Office Party very much falls into the latter category. An interesting if not wholly satisfying experience.\n\nBrown Skin Gal, Stay Home and Mind Bay-Bee [1971] (52:57) Written by Robert Hollies, this is an interesting look at what happens behind closed doors, proving in no uncertain terms that appearances can be deceptive. Well-to-do suburbanites Ruth (Billie Whitelaw, in one of her nine appearances in the Armchair Theatre anthology) and her two friends Olga (Anna Cropper) and Joanna (Ann Firbank) like to gossip, and love a scandal. At first sight, they're the epitome of ladies who lunch \u2013 or in this case, take tea \u2013 who thrive on dissecting the social lives of their friends and neighbours and bemoaning the tribulations of day-to-day life. Ruth meanwhile, has more to contend with, recently divorced, and with a young daughter, she's struggling to adjust to life without her husband. When she lets the basement floor of her house to Roger (Donal McCann) to gain some extra income, the two grow closer, but are bound to the point of suffocation by social mores, and the scrutiny of their friends. Whilst Ruth is very much alone, Roger takes his lecherous workmate Arthur (Mark Kingston) into his confidence, who immediately encourages him to peruse Ruth regardless. Though this first appears to be something light and frothy \u2013 a very British, very 1970s version of Sex and the City, if you will \u2013 there's much more here than meets the eye. Ruth's thinly-veiled loneliness gives everything a tragic tinge, even in its lighter moments. The scenes with her and Roger are particularly fraught, though they come from completely different worlds, their connection is equally obvious, and what remains unsaid between them is just as important as what is \u2013 helped along by the strength of the performances, and the chemistry between, Whitelaw and McCann, which has just the right amount of uneasiness. All good writing stems from observation, and Hollies' script delivers in spades, bringing a surprising amount of depth to the proceedings, which is fitting, since this is as much a play about the artifice of social behaviour and the disparity between the person we present to the world and the person we really are, as it is about suburban life, and the class system. Definitely one of the best in this set.\n\nDetective Waiting [1971] (52:59) Rookie Detective Constable John Lewis (Richard Beckinsale), is sent on a stake out to observe underground crime boss James Cummins (Barry Lineham), and he's determined to convict him at whatever cost. This is a classic cat and mouse tale, and Cummins always seems to have the upper hand, thanks to his high-powered circle of friends. He's the classic rich-living criminal, whereas Lewis is painted as a rather lowly adversary. Labelled by his superior Arthur (Barry Pringle) as argumentative, stubborn and solitary, Lewis is the antithesis of the teamwork-oriented, teambuilding-obsessed ethos of modern policing. This is a man who works hard to get things done, unconcerned by social pleasantries, his job is what matters the most, and it's anything but glamorous, with a lot of his time spent, as the title suggests, just waiting to corner his nemesis, parked outside in his car. Written by Ian Kennedy Martin, famed for his detective and police dramas such as The Sweeney and Juliet Bravo, Detective Waiting prefigures them both, but it's easy to find early indicators of his distinctive writing style, particularly in the pace of the narrative, especially when compared to the other plays on the first disc. Perhaps due to its setting this feels more like a pilot than a play, but this is so well-conceived it's difficult to imagine a character like Lewis in a long-running format and Beckinsale is wonderful to watch as he runs the emotional gamut throughout the story. This is an intriguing piece, which will certainly please any fans of Kennedy Martin's many works.\n\nDisc Two: Will Amelia Quint Continue Writing 'A Gnome Called Shorthouse'? [1971](53:23) The bosses of Denham Publishing Company, Lewis (Richard Vernon) and Miles (Geoffrey Chater), are keen to lure their client, the mysterious Enid Blyton-esque Amelia Quint (a particularly wonderful, Beryl Reid), a successful children's novelist, away from her life in Italy, and back into writing after a long absence. Thinking they have a sure-fire bestseller if she were to work again, Miles sets off to try and persuade her to set pen to paper again. Unfortunately for him, the eccentric Ms Quint is clearly having far too much fun and looks in no mood to trade Italy for England, too busy speeding round her coastal village home on a scooter with not a care in the world, entertained at home by toy-boy gardener Nico (David Warbeck) and chef Guilio (Norman Rossington). As a result, Miles is left with a lengthy list of demands to Lewis back at the publishers' office in order to secure Amelia's continued relationship with the firm, and learns in no uncertain terms that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. There's a lovely aesthetic contrast between the grey-hued, cold, positively dull publisher's office and the sunny, lush, picturesque vistas in Italy, that make you want to get up and follow her there \u2013 which is undoubtedly the point. Of course, it's not entirely coincidental, since, at the time, air travel was booming, and there's an obvious aspirational appeal of living a life like Amelia's which has lost none of it's glamour in the intervening years (especially when you're watching on a cold, snowy January day!) For a series renowned for its roots in social realism and social commentary, with it's audience height reached during the 'kitchen sink' drama era, this is something of a change in look and style, but it's a refreshing one, heralded in by producer Sydney Newman, who wanted to leave those associations behind. While it's primarily a light-hearted piece, with some particularly snappy one-liners, it doesn't disregard these roots entirely, since writer Roy Clarke has made painted a very British picture of living aboard \u2013 stereotypes and all. In many ways, the marvellous Ms Quint is aptly named, since it's impossible to imagine her being from any other country but ours. Though she may be the embodiment of eccentrics everywhere, she's definitely quintessentially British. A great deal of fun.\n\nThe Folk Singer [1972] (51:20) This year saw the Armchair get reupholstered in the form of a new title sequence, trading in the multicoloured flashing words for an equally rainbow-decked dancer, and rather classy looking font. Much like the bizarrely titled Amelia Quint, The Folk Singer came as something of a surprise. Firstly, it flags up just how different the output of Armchair Theatre could be in terms of tone whilst still retaining an important outlet for social commentary. Indeed, in its formative years, it was known for its chameleon-like nature. Secondly, it emphasizes that these plays aren't as throwaway and as the lighter constituents of the anthology would have you believe, and are in fact, an important social, cultural and historical document as well as a significant contribution to television drama. Thirdly, it proves that these plays most certainly deserve their reputation as groundbreaking; it's hard to imagine a writer being given the freedom that Dominic Behan is afforded here, even in the digital era. Given the year of its production, it's hardly surprising that the political and religious divisions in Ireland made the transition from the headlines to the arena of drama. Historically speaking, dramatising the topical often leads to a better understanding of the fact behind the fiction, and this is no exception. It's opening moments confront the issues of religion directly, with both Catholic and Protestant views represented in the form of two married couples (one of whom is a Catholic priest) while they watch news coverage of rioting on television. In folk singer Danny Blake (Tom Bell) Behan has the perfect, accessible and perhaps most importantly acceptable cipher through which to direct his plea for tolerance between all citizens of the United Kingdom, nay the world. At first glance, the figure of Danny seems a rather an unlikely messenger for peace, since he looks like the long lost brother of Shameless' Frank Gallagher crossed with Bob Dylan and an added dash of Gram Parsons for good measure, but that's why this drama works so well. Holed up in a Belfast, hotel with his manager Eddie (Bernard Spear), assistant-turned-girlfriend Miss Arrowroot (Celia Bannerman) and guitarist Steve (Steve Benbow) while a 'no go' drill remains in effect, with all manner of other people, ranging from loud-mouthed American tourists to a learned psychologist and a patriotic workman. With bombs going off the city around them (the first blast is a particular shock), Danny pens songs with the help of Miss Arrowroot for the other guests, procured by the hotel manager (Allan M'Clelland) to put on a show for them, in the absence of the other booked artists, who've been arrested by Police on route. More than any other play in this set, it has to be viewed and interpreted in the context of the 1970s to be fully appreciated for the powerful and contentious piece of drama it is. Behan's script and the performances of the diverse and talented cast somehow manage to make The Folk Singer and his very particular views a thoughtful and engaging piece of drama, which balances the seriousness of its serious subject matter with a dose of intelligent humour.\n\nA Bit of a Lift [1972] (52:37) The opening of this play reveals another title card change for the series, but it also highlights some interesting changes for the construction of the play itself. This is much closer in feel to modern-day single dramas than the live two act dramas Armchair Theatre began broadcasting in the 1950s. Gone are the intertitles that tell us of the division between one act and another, in favour of 'parts' akin to the rest of ITV's output. This is a small thing, mere semantics perhaps, but there's a definite shift here away from the theatrical form toward the televisual, a telling reflection of the times. This could be perceived as indicative of the beginnings of wider 'dumbing down' debates that dog contemporary television, but for the more optimistically inclined, it's simply a reflection of the fact that by it's very nature, the drama genre and television drama in particular are evolutionary, tied to the ever-changing boundaries of cultural and social taste. Written by and starring Donald Churchill, this is a surprisingly humorous look at the power of fate, and how the seemingly accidental crossing of paths can change our lives irrevocably. For henpecked husband Frank (Churchill), that life can't get much worse. Contemplating suicide, he records a final message for wife Barbara in a street booth, sending it off in the post. He journeys to the London hotel where the two held their wedding reception, coming across a wedding party. Amongst them are solicitor Alec (Ronald Fraser) and lonely divorcee Penelope (Ann Beach). Through a series of mistakes and misunderstandings, Alec and Frank become acquainted, changing the course of his plans. Part comedy of errors, part social critique, Lift is something of a surprise and a good one at that. I always like to be surprised by something, and the opening moments of the play had me rather concerned, but I was most certainly proved wrong. The success of the piece stems from the fact it utilises that oh so typically British brand of self-deprecating wit. Even at his lowest ebb, Frank can find something to laugh at, even if it's himself. It's a testament to the strength of Churchill's writing and performance that Frank ultimately becomes more to us than the mild-mannered gentleman we meet in the opening moments. Elsewhere Fraser and Beach work wonderfully together, acting out a rather screwball-esque, rather cheeky spin on the classic British ode to repressed love, Brief Encounter.\n\nRed Riding Hood [1973] (52:11) John Peacock's nightmarish, and at times more than a little disturbing take on the classic fable Little Red Riding Hood brings the curtain down in this last disc, and it certainly goes out with a bang. Exploiting the inherent elements of fear within these traditional stories to give it darkest of dark hearts, Powell transposes the story to modern Britain, posing more questions than it answers in regard to the ramifications of testing moral boundaries combined with the pressures of doing and being good. It makes for an explosive mix. Shy, retiring librarian Grace (a quite frankly incredible Rita Tushingham) is the nicest woman you could hope to meet. Caring for both her grandmother (Hilda Barry) and father (Arthur Hewlett), she has little time to herself. Stuck in her job, kept down by a mean-spirited boss, troubled by her family debts, she's left to daydream about what her life could be like. Most of the time, those dreams include the handsome, charismatic bookseller Harry (an equally powerful Keith Barron), who provides book lending to the elderly. Finally reaching the end of her tether in more ways than one, Grace makes her usual visit to her grandmother, only to find Harry has stopped off with books in hand. After that, things are far from usual. If pressed, and you only had to pick one example to embody all that Amrchair Theatre is, I'd argue that there's no finer example than Red Riding Hood. Where this play excels is in the quality of the performances and in the writing: the cornerstone of this anthology as a whole. So often these exercises in adaptation can just make the result on screen feel like a rather poor relation and only foster nostalgic memories of how much you enjoyed the original story. However, on rare occasions there are exceptions, and Powell's work is one of them. As a child, I'd never really bought into the idea that the innocent little Red was so easily duped by that sly old fox, but when that sly old fox looks like he could have stepped off the set of a Bond film or could be the true identity of the mysterious Milk Tray Man, you could be forgiven for being lulled into a false sense of security. Powell's masterstroke though, is to plant the seed that some of Grace's fantasies may indeed be indications of her finally breaking down under all the pressure she's endured for so long. Tushingham's blood-curdling scream in the final moments signal that we've not only witnessed her descent into darkness, but her unravelling of her mind too. sound and vision Armchair Theatre was recorded and stored on broadcast video tape \u2013 I'm guessing Quad \u2013 in the early 1970s a a noticeably lower resolution of even the standard definition broadcasts of today. There's thus a softness to the image that's accentuated by HD upscaling. There are also odd traces of minor tape damage accrued over time - horizontal blips, the odd burst of coloured noise. But the are all par for the course on transfers from 1970s video-shot television drama, and within these limitations the transfer is solid enough, with nicely balanced contrast and reasonable if slightly muted colour. As was the way at the time, exterior footage is shot on 16mm and the switch to and from film is visible. As the series progresses the defects gradually disappear and even the sharpness improves just a tad. The small box of moving diagonal lines in the top right corner to signify upcoming ad breaks should prompt a twinge of nostalgia in those old enough to remember them. The Dolby 2.0 mono track is in better shape than you might expect, with the dialogue and sound effects clear and boasting a rather good dynamic range, both of which serve the programmes well. extra features Though there are none to speak of, don't let that put you off making a purchase, since you won't come away from this feeling short-changed. The work, as they say, speaks for itself. summary Consistently high in quality, this release provides just a taster of why Armchair Theatre became synonymous with, and set the benchmark for, television drama. The mere fact these exemplary dramas exist on DVD at all is reason enough to add it to your collection. Whether you're revisiting them from the perspective of nostalgia or coming to them fresh as a fan of quality drama, then you're in for a treat. This was a pleasure to watch and I was left hankering for more. To that end, I do hope that Network release more volumes in the future. Highly recommended."}]}
