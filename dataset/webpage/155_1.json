The largest and busiest airport in France is named after him\n\nA\u00e9roport de Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle or Paris Charles De Gaulle International Airport is recognized as the largest and busiest airport in the country.\n\nLocated in Roissy-en-France, 23 kilometers northeast of the French capital, the Charles de Gaulle Airport also goes by the names Roissy Airport and Paris CDG. It opened in 1974 and spans 32.38 square kilometres of land.\n\nThe Charles de Gaulle Airport is the world\u2019s 9th busiest airport. In Europe, it is second only to London\u2019s Heathrow. Within the EU, it is on the number one spot in terms of passenger numbers.\n\n2. He is known in France simply as \u201cle G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201d or \u201cthe General\u201d\n\nGen. Charles de Gaulle was a statesman and officer in the French army who headed the Free French movement that fought the Nazis during the Second World War.\n\nDe Gaulle\u2019s interest in the military started when he was a boy. It was not surprising that he decided to attend the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in Guer, France.\n\nIn 1913, de Gaulle, who was then a young second lieutenant, became a member of an infantry regiment that Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain commanded. P\u00e9tain who fought in the First World War would later be imprisoned for treason.\n\nAs a soldier, de Gaulle was brilliant, hardworking, and passionate. Throughout his military career that spanned from 1912 to 1944, he had been known to possess outstanding courge and great self-assurance. His rank was brigadier general.\n\n3. He had fought in 8 battles\n\nGeneral de Gaulle had fought in a total of 8 battles, which were the following: Battle of Verdun, Battle of the Somme, Polish \u2013 Soviet War, Battle of France, Battle of Montcornet, Battle of Abbeville, Battle of Dakar, and the Liberation of Paris.\n\n4. Charles de Gaulle saved France from several crises\n\nGen. de Gaulle had saved his country from several deep crises.\n\nFirst, he was hugely responsible for the liberation of France from the Nazis during the Second World War. This made \u201cle G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\u201d a war and national hero.\n\nWhen World War II was over, de Gaulle became the leader of the nation during some of France\u2019s tensest periods \u2013 from 1944 through 1946 and from 1958 until 1969.\n\nHe is also linked with the founding of the most recent Fifth French Republic as well as the making of a new constitution which strengthened the institution of the presidency.\n\nAs president, Charles de Gaulle worked hard for the French politics to be more nationalist, which reinforced its position in the international scene.\n\n5. Charles de Gaulle married on April 6, 1921\n\nCharles de Gaulle was a military captain who was recently home from a mission in Poland when he met young Yvonne Vendroux.\n\nA year later, on 6 April 1921, the two were married in the Notre-Dame de Calais Church in Calais on the Opal Coast, where the Vendroux family was from.\n\n6. Charles de Gaulle had a daughter with Down syndrome\n\nThe union of Charles de Gaulle and Yvonne Vendroux produced three children: Philippe (born in 1921), \u00c9lisabeth (born in 1924), and Anne (born in 1928).\n\nThe youngest child, Anne de Gaulle, was born in the German city of Trier where her soldier father was stationed. She was born with Down syndome, a genetic disorder that is usually associated with distinct facial features, intellectual disability which can be mild to moderate, and delays in physical growth.\n\nSuffice it to say, Anne was his father\u2019s favorite. He would often sing and dance with her, or do pantomimes to entertain her.\n\nIn 1945, the de Gaulles established the Fondation Anne de Gaulle at the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur at Milon-la-Chapelle, in north-central France. It was a private hospital for handicapped girls like Anne, who succumbed to bronchial pneumonia in 1948.\n\n7. Charles de Gaulles was a devout Catholic\n\nCharles de Gaulle was raised in a strictly Catholic family. Henri de Gaulle, Charles\u2019 father, taught history and literature at a Jesuit high school in Paris.\n\nIt was Charles de Gaulle\u2019s religious parents who were responsible for his spiritual and intellectual formation in the Catholic faith. Prior to the military academy, he attended Catholic schools.\n\nWhen he was 16, Charles de Gaulle volunteered to be a stretcher-bearer at Lourdes. There he witnessed a miracle: a paralyzed Italian girl cured during the holy procession.\n\nDe Gaulle frequently attended the Mass and as a student he was one of the few who joined Congregation of the Holy Virgin, a religious organization devoted to prayer and spiritual meditation.\n\n8. De Gaulle became President of the French Republic on 21 December 1958\n\nDe Gaulle was elected President by an electoral college. He was reelected for a second term in 1965. He resigned from presidency in 1969, following the failure of his referendum in which he proposed more decentralization.\n\n9. His First Lady was also a conservative Catholic\n\nYvonne de Gaulle was strictly Catholic just like her husband. Mrs. de Gaulle fought against prostitution, pornography and its sale in newsstands, and the display of sex and nudity on TV.\n\nFor her conservative Catholic views, Yvonne de Gaulle garned the famous nickname \u201cTante Yvonne,\u201d or \u201cAuntie Yvonne.\u201d\n\n10. Charles de Gaulle survived 30 attempts on his life\n\nIf cats had nine lives, Charles de Gaulle had 30!\n\nThe most prominent of all these attempts was led by Jean Bastien-Thiry, a lieutenant-colonel in the French Air Force and also a military air-weaponry engineer.\n\nBastien-Thiry belonged to the Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te, a right-wing organization that opposed President de Gaulle\u2019s decision to sign the independence of Algeria.\n\nHe was the last man in France to be executed by firing squad for his foiled assassination attempt on the president on August 22, 1962.\n\n11. His daughter Anne\u2019s picture saved General de Gaulle\u2019s life\n\nThe 22 August 1962 failed assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle took place as he was riding his limousine with his wife at Petit-Clamart, a suburb of Paris.\n\nA potentially fatal bullet from the machine gun that ambushed the couple hit the frame of Anne de Gaulle\u2019s picture that her father always carried with him.\n\nThat day, the picture frame was placed on the rear shelf of the de Gaulle\u2019s limo, saving President de Gaulle\u2019s life by stopping the bullet that would have otherwise hit him.\n\n12. Charles de Gaulle died a natural death two weeks shy of his 80th birthday\n\nAfter so many foiled attempts on Charles de Gaulle\u2019s life, he enjoyed a very healthy life until November 9, 1970 \u2013 just a couple of weeks shy of his 80th birthday.\n\nHe died of aneurysm in his home in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, watching TV and playing cards.\n\nThen French President Georges Pompidou announced General de Gaulle\u2019s death the following morning with a simple statement: \u201cLe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle est mort; la France est veuve.\u201d Translated to English, it means: \u201cGeneral de Gaulle is dead. France is a widow.\u201d\n\nHi, I\u2019m Christine \u2013 a full-time traveler and career woman. Although I\u2019m from the Philippines, my location independent career took me to over 40 countries and lived in 4 continents in the last 10 years, including France.

Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://the-american-catholic.com/2013/08/06/anne-de-gaulle-2/", "page_content": "(I wrote this post back in 2009.

Name variations: Madame de Gaulle. Born Yvonne Charlotte Anne-Marie Vendroux (pronunciation: Vahn-DROO) on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France; died on November 8, 1979, in the military hospital Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, Paris; daughter of Jacques Vendroux (the head of a biscuit manufacturing company) and Marguerite (Forest) Vendroux; received primary and secondary education largely with private tutors at home; spent several years at a primary school, Notre-Dame in Calais; married Charles de Gaulle, on April 7, 1921 (a civil ceremony took place the previous day but it was the religious ceremony held April 7 that was regarded as their wedding by the de Gaulles); children: Philippe (b. December 28, 1921); Elisabeth de Boissieu (b. May 15, 1924); Anne de Gaulle (January 1, 1928\u2013February 6, 1948).\n\nChildhood years spent in family home in Calais; at age five, began primary education with private tutors (1905); as German forces advanced toward Calais at outset of WWI, Vendroux family took refuge in England (July\u2013August 1914); family returned to Calais (December 1914); cared for war wounded in Calais (1915\u201316); left Calais, under threat of German bombs, for safety in Paris (1916); as renewed German offensive threatened Paris (March 1918), sent out of harm's way to Mortagne, Brittany, then Perigueux (summer and autumn, 1918); worked with mother among the wounded war veterans in Calais (1919\u201320); met Charles de Gaulle (October 1920); after marriage, lived together in Paris (1921); moved with Charles, who was promoted to major and placed in charge of 19th Battalion of Light Infantry in Trier, Germany (1927); moved with family to Beirut (then in Syria, a French mandate of the League of Nations, now Lebanon), where Charles was posted (1929); returned to Paris (1931); purchased La Boisserie, an estate in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the Haute-Marne department in eastern France (June 9, 1934); based in Metz where Charles commanded the 507th Tank Regiment (1937); outbreak of WWII (September 1, 1939); Germans entered Paris (June 14, 1940); de Gaulle family left France for London (June 17) where Charles' first BBC radio broadcast back to France called for resistance against Germany (June 18); moved to join Charles in liberated Algiers (July 1943); Allied invasion of Normandy (June 6, 1944); rejoined Charles, now head of the Provisional Government, in Neuilly, near Paris (September 1944); Charles resigned as head of the Provisional Government (January, 1946); moved back into La Boisserie(May 1946); death of daughter Anne, caused by pneumonia (February 6, 1948); returned to Paris with re-call of Charles to power during Algerian crisis (June 1, 1958); became \"first lady\" of France upon the inauguration of Charles as first president of the Fifth Republic (January 8, 1959); narrowly survived an assassination attempt in the company of her husband (August 22, 1962); retired to La Boisserie after referendum defeat of de Gaulle (April 1969); death of Charles de Gaulle (November 9, 1970).\n\nOn August 22, 1962, in the Paris suburb of Petit-Clamart, en route from the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace to the town of Villacoublay, the French presidential car was ambushed by a commando who fired some 150 shots from automatic weapons. Fourteen bullets struck the car in which Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, their son-in-law Alain de Boissieu, and the driver Francis Marroux were riding, on their way for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. No one was hit. The Petit-Clamart attack was but the closest call in a series of assassination attempts by groups opposed to Charles de Gaulle's ceding of independence to the rebellious colony of Algeria. The general, at least according to some accounts, had been too proud even to drop to the floor during the fusillade, and, even though a bullet passed between their heads, Yvonne de Gaulle had also remained seated erect during the attack. Upon their arrival at Villacoublay, the general turned to his wife and said: \"Yvonne, you are brave.\"\n\nYvonne de Gaulle's behavior during and after the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt typified the stoicism, courage, and fidelity that characterized her entire adult life and for which she is remembered in France. Years after her death, President Richard Nixon remembered her having said in 1969, \"the presidency is temporary, the family permanent.\" The product of a middle-class Catholic family from Calais, in Normandy, Yvonne de Gaulle exemplified the \"dutiful wife and mother,\" silent in public but influential behind the scenes. Deeply religious and private, she kept to herself whatever complaints she might have had living with the self-assured and frequently cantankerous Charles de Gaulle. She lived so privately that, even as first lady in France during the 1960s, she was able to shop in Parisian stores without being recognized. Although her role came increasingly into question in the France of the 1960s, she nonetheless came to be respected in France as \"Tante Yvonne\" (Aunt Yvonne), during the presidency of her husband.\n\nThe daughter of Jacques and Marguerite Vendroux , Yvonne Vendroux was born on May 22, 1900, in the family home in Calais, on the Channel coast of France. Her father, who had gone into the biscuit-producing business, came from a long line of shipowners and local mayors and was himself vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, a municipal councilor, and the honorary consul of several foreign countries. He was, in French terms, a \"notable,\" or local dignitary. His family, the Van Droog, tobacco producers, had moved in the late 17th century from Delft in Holland to Dunkirk, where the name was changed to Vandroux; later the family moved to Calais, where the name was changed to Vendroux. Yvonne's mother, Marguerite Forest Vendroux, was the granddaughter of a well-known notary of the town of Charleville.\n\nMadame de Gaulle's importance was considerable not for what she said or did but for what she neither did nor said, by her silent presence. \u2014Andr\u00e9 Malraux\n\nYvonne Vendroux had a happy and stable childhood. Raised amid comfortable circumstances, the second of four children, she spent her early years with her family, in Calais in the winter and in a country estate in the Ardennes during the summer, where she went mountain climbing and developed a lifelong love of nature, especially flowers. Most of her schooling took place in the form of home tutoring. Dubious about the quality of the local schools after the 1905 separation of church and state in France, Yvonne's parents hired a tutor, Mademoiselle Delannoy , for her primary education. After 1907, she was sent for awhile as a day student to the local Notre-Dame boarding school, but her parents retained the tutor to supplement their daughter's education. Her secondary school education took place entirely at home.\n\nYvonne's first communion, in 1911, was followed by three relatively carefree years, broken with the onset of World War I in August 1914. As German forces advanced toward Calais and bombs fell on the town early in the war, the Vendroux family took refuge in Kent, in southern England. By the end of 1914, when it had become clear that the French forces would hold and Calais would be safe from German invasion, the Vendroux family returned. There, Yvonne's activities continued to revolve around the home as her mother cared for wounded war veterans. In 1916, seeking greater security, the family again left Calais for Paris, where Yvonne remained until March 1918, when a renewed German offensive led the family to send her and her sister Suzanne to Brittany. Now 18, Yvonne next went to Perigueux, where she spent the final days of World War I. With the end of the war, the Vendroux family turned to the restoration of their various properties in the Calais and Ardennes areas. Yvonne assumed an increasing role in household management, allowing her mother to continue to work in veterans' hospitals. Her older brother Jacques accompanied her as chaperon to the parties and balls in Paris and Calais. Yvonne soon joined her mother working among the war wounded, widows, and orphans.\n\nIn October 1920, at a tea arranged by family friends, Yvonne met Captain Charles de Gaulle, then on a brief leave from service with the French military mission in Poland. Shortly thereafter, he invited her to a ball at Saint-Cyr, the French military academy. Taken with Charles, Yvonne accepted and went in the company of Jacques. A few days later, asked directly about her feelings toward Charles, Yvonne replied, \"It will be he or no one.\" The families met, and the couple was officially affianced on November 11, 1920. Charles had to return for two additional months' service in Poland, then returned to France in February. He was named professor of history at Saint-Cyr, a post that would keep him in Paris.\n\nYvonne Vendroux and Charles de Gaulle were married in a civil ceremony in Calais on April 6, 1921, and in a religious ceremony the next day at the Notre-Dame Church in that city. Following their marriage, the young couple settled in a modest Paris apartment and lived a relatively quiet life. Their son Philippe was born at the end of 1921. In 1924, their second child, Elizabeth, was born. Charles finished his studies at the War College, published his first book, La Discorde chez l'Ennemi (Discord in the Enemy), and was posted as an officer working with Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain, the hero of World War I, with whose career his own would be dramatically crossed. In 1927, Yvonne de Gaulle joined her husband in a posting in Trier, Germany, where in 1928, their daughter Anne was born. Within months of Anne's birth, it had become clear that she was suffering from Down's syndrome. Anne was never to speak well or eat or dress unaided. Her illness was the great personal tragedy of the de Gaulles who cared for her tenderly.\n\nIn 1929, the de Gaulles were sent to Beirut, Lebanon, then part of French-controlled Syria, where they remained until 1931. In 1932, Yvonne's father died; her mother died the following year. At the end of 1933, Charles de Gaulle was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In June 1934, the de Gaulles bought \"La Boisserie,\" the estate of Yvonne's late parents, located in the village of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises, in the gently rolling hills of the Haute-Marne department about midway between Paris and France's eastern frontier. The year 1934 also saw the publication of Charles' second book, Vers l'arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (The Army of the Future), which argued, to little avail, that the French should adopt new mechanized forms of warfare. In 1937, Charles was given the command of the 507th Tank Regiment based in Metz. Life for the de Gaulle family revolved quietly around Paris, Metz, and La Boisserie.\n\nYvonne's domain was the family home at La Boisserie, her place of refuge from the turbulent political affairs surrounding her husband. She quietly endured the tragedy of Anne's disabilities while living with a man who was very much a lone rebel in political and military circles during the 1930s, and who clearly ruled as master of the household. Known for his arrogance, Charles was said to be a tyrant at home, with Yvonne silently bearing the brunt of his disappointment and frustration. Charles dominated conversations; Yvonne was told plainly, and sometimes publicly, that her opinion did not count. On more than one occasion Charles was observed telling his wife to be silent, that she could not possibly know anything about politics. Years later, an acquaintance said that compared to the cheerful if somewhat reticent young woman who had married Charles in 1921, the Yvonne of the late 1930s was profoundly sad.\n\nThe outbreak of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939 found Charles in command of his tank regiment. Poland was quickly crushed by the Germans, but the war with France involved little actual fighting in what became known as the dr\u00f4le de guerre, or phony war. This changed with the German thrust westward of May 10, 1940. The force of the German onslaught was such that, within days, Charles was writing from the front to Yvonne at La Boisserie, warning her to be ready for quick flight in the event that the military situation turned disastrous. On June 1, Charles was promoted to brigadier-general. Five days later, he was appointed undersecretary of state for National Defense and War by Premier Paul Reynaud. The Germans entered Paris on June 14. On June 16, the Reynaud government was replaced by one headed by Marshal P\u00e9tain, who was committed to seeking peace with the Germans. A day later, Yvonne with her three children and their governess left for England to join her husband, a political exile.\n\nFor the second time in her life, Yvonne de Gaulle experienced wartime exile in England. On June 18, Charles broadcast back to France, calling on the entire nation to resist the Germans and any French authority that supported collaboration with them. In London, their son Philippe, then 18 years old, joined the newly created Free French Navy in July. In addition to the occupation of her homeland, Yvonne had to accept the fact that her husband was now a rebel, standing almost alone against his country's legal government, which was headed by World War I hero and his own former sponsor, Marshal P\u00e9tain. Moreover, P\u00e9tain sentenced Charles to death in absentia for wartime desertion and treason. Yvonne set up a household in London as he organized what became the Free French resistance to Nazi Germany and the government of Vichy France. Whatever his other activities in wartime London, Charles was invariably present to tell Anne stories at her bedtime and to shield her from the press.\n\nTogether with other Londoners, Yvonne endured the German Blitz or air raids in the summer and fall of 1940, but ultimately her faith in her husband's vision was rewarded; the fortunes of war turned with the entry of the Soviet Union and the United States into combat against the Nazis. Following the liberation of French North Africa, the de Gaulle family returned to Algiers in June 1943. The liberation of metropolitan France, which began with the D-Day landings in Normandy, June 6, 1944, left the country under the Free French, reorganized as a Provisional Government and headed by Charles de Gaulle. In late August, Paris was liberated and by the end of September, almost all of metropolitan France had been cleared of Germans. Yvonne, now the wife of the leader of the Provisional Government, returned home to supervise the reconstruction of La Boisserie, which had been pillaged and partially burned during the Occupation. Charles, however, became increasingly dispirited as the politicians who had dominated prewar politics and, in his view, had brought on the catastrophe of 1940, regained strength, promising to recreate what he called the \"regime of parties.\" On January 3, 1946, a few weeks after the marriage of daughter Elisabeth to Commander Alain de Boissieu, Charles abruptly resigned his position. The family lived until May in an uncomfortable house rented from the government while La Boisserie was being restored and Charles waited restlessly to be recalled to power.\n\nIn 1946, with the help of Georges Pompidou, who later served as one of Charles' prime ministers and was to become his successor as president, the de Gaulles established the Anne de Gaulle Foundation to help handicapped girls. The Foundation was to care for Anne in the event that her parents predeceased her. Supported financially by the income from Charles' books, the Foundation built a house on a wooded hill in the Chevreuse valley. Staffed by six nuns and a mother superior, the house eventually provided for some 40 handicapped girls. Yvonne helped select them.\n\nIn April 1947, Charles created the Rassemblement du Peuple Fran\u00e7ais (Rally of the French People), a political party that was to serve as a vehicle for his return to power. Then, on February 6, 1948, Anne died of bronchial pneumonia at age 20. With the death of Anne, the Anne de Gaulle Foundation occupied much of Yvonne's attention. She also accompanied Charles throughout France as he campaigned for his new RPF, but by 1952, the party was fading and he ended it the next year. These years were spent, often with their grandchildren, at La Boisserie where Charles worked on his memoirs, with occasional trips abroad where he was received as the hero of the wartime French Resistance. To visitors at La Boisserie, Yvonne occasionally expressed the desire to protect her husband \"for history,\" and keep him out of politics. The tranquil life was interrupted, however, when the government's inability to suppress the Algerian rebellion led to rioting by European Algerians in the streets of Algiers on May 13, 1958. La Boisserie was quickly turned into a command post as Charles and his advisors planned his return to office. On June 1, Charles de Gaulle was voted in as premier by the National Assembly with full powers to write a new constitution for France. The result was France's Fifth Republic, with a much stronger presidency, filled in 1959 by Charles de Gaulle.\n\nOnce again, Yvonne de Gaulle was a reluctant first lady of France. During the early 1960s, Charles survived several assassination attempts by opponents of independence for Algeria. The closest call was the Petit-Clamart fusillade in 1962. Profiting by the wave of sympathy engendered by the assassination attempt, Charles proposed a constitutional change to elect the president by universal suffrage, which was approved by popular referendum in October. In 1965, against Yvonne's will, he stood as a candidate for the presidency. Forced into a runoff with Socialist candidate Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, Charles was elected in the second round to a seven-year term.\n\nTo many in 1960s France, \"Aunt Yvonne\" came to represent the wife of a previous era. She accompanied Charles to innumerable Paris Opera galas, where she sat through close to 30 performances of \"Carmen,\" and hosted the Kennedys, Khrushchevs, and many other world leaders. The comparison of the prim and somewhat dowdy Yvonne, who scrupulously supervised the household affairs of France's presidential \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, with the youthful and fashionable Jacqueline Kennedy , who accompanied her husband, then president of the United States, on a visit to Paris in 1961, was played out in the international press. Wearing sedate black, gray, or mauve dresses designed by Paris couturier Jacques Heim, Yvonne avoided d\u00e9colletage and shunned the more up-to-date fashions of Coco Chanel . Yvonne's successor as France's first lady, Claude Pompidou , recalled later that Yvonne's only advice to her had been to wear hats. Yvonne arranged the floral decorations of the palace, and she loved to travel and accompany her husband on all his official trips abroad, but whenever possible, she returned\n\nto La Boisserie and the gardens that were her favorite pastime.\n\nA strict Catholic, Yvonne set an austere tone at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, making sure the private lives of those in her husband's entourage passed moral muster. Exerting a considerable, if private, influence, she saw to it that divorcees were weeded out of influential positions and excluded from presidential social functions. She was equally severe in her judgments of much of the literature and film of the 1960s and carefully scrutinized the selection of films to be shown in the palace. For her religious devotions, she had a special chapel built inside the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.\n\nYvonne was with Charles when, during the height of the student and worker unrest of May 1968, he traveled to Baden-Baden to consult with French generals about the possibility of his resigning. She shared his disappointment, when, in April 1969, in a referendum he had called on behalf of decentralizing political reforms, he was defeated. Having staked his political prestige on the referendum, Charles immediately resigned. The couple returned to La Boisserie, where on November 9, 1970, Charles died. Yvonne continued to live there, where she cooked, knitted, and tended her garden, visited often by her children and four grandchildren until the fall of 1978, when she withdrew to the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception convent in Paris. In July 1979, she was operated on in Paris for an intestinal obstruction. Readmitted to a Paris military hospital, she died November 8, 1979. She was buried beside Charles and Anne at the church cemetery in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. Surviving Yvonne, in addition to her son Philippe and daughter Elisabeth, were her grandchildren and one great-grandson. Mourned as the symbol of moral rectitude and marital fidelity of a long gone era, \"Tante Yvonne\" was called the \"minister of common sense\" in the government of General Charles de Gaulle. Following her death, La Boisserie, which remained in the possession of Philippe, was converted into a museum, open to the public, in honor of the de Gaulles.\n\nsources:\n\nB\u00e9liard, Jean. \"Entretien avec Richard Nixon,\" in Institut Charles de Gaulle.

This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/13/archives/de-gaulle-is-buried-with-quiet-simplicity-de-gaulle-buried-in.html", "page_content": "By early afternoon tense of thousands had arrived by car, train and bus, They were of all ages and came from all parts of France.

It is usually caused by infection. It can be fatal and requires immediate medical care.\n\nMeningitis can be caused by several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Most infections can be transmitted from person to person. Injuries, cancers and drugs cause a small number of cases.\n\nBacterial meningitis is the most common dangerous type of meningitis and can be fatal within 24 hours.\n\nMeningitis can affect people of any age.\n\nThere are effective treatments and vaccines against some of the main bacterial causes of meningitis. However, meningitis remains a significant threat around the world.\n\nThere are four main causes of acute bacterial meningitis:\n\nNeisseria meningitidis (meningococcus)\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus)\n\nHaemophilus influenzae\n\nStreptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus)\n\nThese bacteria are responsible for more than half of the deaths from meningitis globally and they cause other severe diseases like sepsis and pneumonia.\n\nOther bacteria e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella, Listeria, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, viruses such as enteroviruses and mumps, fungi, especially Cryptococcus, and parasites like Amoeba are also important causes of meningitis.\n\nWho is at risk?\n\nAlthough meningitis affects all ages, young children are most at risk. Newborn babies are at most risk from Group B streptococcus, young children are at higher risk from meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae. Adolescents and young adults are at particular risk of meningococcal disease while the elderly are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease.\n\nPeople all over the world are at risk of meningitis. The highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, known as the African Meningitis Belt, especially recognised to be at high risk of epidemics of meningococcal but also pneumococcal meningitis.\n\nHigher risk is seen when people are living in close proximity, for example at mass gatherings, in refugee camps, in overcrowded households or in student, military and other occupational settings. Immune deficiencies such as HIV infection or complement deficiency, immunosuppression, and active or passive smoking can also raise the risk of different types of meningitis.\n\nTransmission\n\nThe route of transmission varies by organism. Most bacteria that cause meningitis such as meningococcus, pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae are carried in the human nose and throat. They spread from person to person by respiratory droplets or throat secretions. Group B streptococcus is often carried in the human gut or vagina and can spread from mother to child around the time of birth.\n\nCarriage of these organisms is usually harmless and helps build up immunity against infection, but the bacteria occasionally invade the body causing meningitis and sepsis.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nClinical features of patients with meningitis vary depending on the cause, disease course (acute, subacute or chronic), brain involvement (meningo-encephalitis) and systemic complications (e.g., sepsis).\n\n\n\nCommon symptoms of meningitis are neck stiffness, fever, confusion or altered mental status, headaches, nausea and vomiting.\n\n\n\nLess frequent symptoms are seizures, coma and neurological deficits (for example hearing or vision loss, cognitive impairment, or weakness of the limbs).\n\nTypes of meningitis caused by viruses or bacteria can have similar symptoms. Symptoms may be stronger in some types of meningitis than in others and require different treatment.\n\nBacterial meningitis pathogens can cause other symptoms as a result of bloodstream infections (septicaemia), which can quickly lead to sepsis, including:\n\ncold hands and feet\n\njoint and muscle pains\n\nbreathing faster than usual\n\ndiarrhoea\n\ndark purple or red rash.\n\nBabies sometimes have different symptoms than adults:\n\nbeing less active and difficult to wake\n\nbeing irritable or inconsolable\n\npoor feeding\n\nstiff or floppy body\n\nswelling in the soft spot in their head (fontanelle).\n\nComplications and sequelae\n\nOne in 5 people surviving an episode of bacterial meningitis may have long lasting after-effects. These after-effects include hearing loss, seizures, limb weakness, difficulties with vision, speech, language, memory, and communication, as well as scarring and limb amputations after sepsis.\n\nPrevention\n\nVaccines offer the best protection against common types of bacterial meningitis.\n\nVaccines can prevent meningitis caused by:\n\nmeningococcus\n\npneumococcus\n\nhaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib).\n\nBacterial and viral meningitis can spread from person to person. If you live with someone who has either type of meningitis, you should:\n\nTalk to your doctor or nurse about taking antibiotics (in case of bacterial meningitis)\n\nWash hands frequently, especially before eating\n\nAvoid close contact and sharing cups, utensils or toothbrushes.\n\nLicensed vaccines against meningococcal, pneumococcal and Haemophilus influenzae disease have been available for many years. These bacteria have several different strains (known as serotypes or serogroups) and vaccines are designed to protect against the most harmful strains. No universal vaccine exists.\n\nIn the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80\u201385% of meningitis epidemics before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass preventive campaigns (since 2010) and into routine immunization programmes (since 2016). Continuing introduction into routine immunization programmes and maintaining high coverage is critical to avoid the resurgence of epidemics.\n\n2. Antibiotics for prevention (chemoprophylaxis)\n\nAntibiotics for close contacts of those with meningococcal disease, when given promptly, decreases the risk of transmission. Outside the African meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis is recommended for close contacts within the household. Within the meningitis belt, chemoprophylaxis for close contacts is recommended in non-epidemic situations. Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice, and ceftriaxone an alternative.\n\nIdentifying mothers whose babies are at risk of getting Group B streptococcal disease is recommended in many countries. Mothers at risk are offered intravenous penicillin during labour to prevent their babies developing Group B streptococcal infection.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nInitial diagnosis of meningitis can be made by clinical examination followed by a lumbar puncture. The bacteria can sometimes be seen in microscopic examinations of the spinal fluid. The diagnosis is supported or confirmed by growing the bacteria from specimens of cerebrospinal fluid or blood, by rapid diagnostic tests or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The identification of the serogroups and susceptibility to antibiotics are important to define control measures. Molecular typing and whole genome sequencing identify more differences between strains and inform public health responses.\n\nTreatment\n\nMeningitis is a medical emergency.\n\nMeningitis is potentially fatal within 24 hours and requires urgent medical attention. It usually cannot be safely cared for at home.\n\nMeningitis caused by viruses or bacteria can have similar symptoms. Meningitis can vary in severity, appropriate treatment and care depending on the cause. Meningitis caused by bacteria requires immediate antibiotic treatment.\n\nAny person who shows signs or symptoms or meningitis should seek immediate care at a hospital or health centre. This will verify if a person has meningitis, confirm the cause of infection and determine the right treatment and care.\n\nMeningitis sequelae can have an enormous impact on individuals, families and communities, both financially and emotionally. Sometimes, complications such as deafness, learning impairment or behavioural problems are not recognized by carers and healthcare workers and therefore go untreated.\n\nThose who have lived through meningitis often have health-care needs requiring long-term medical treatments. The ongoing psychosocial impacts of disability from meningitis can have medical, educational, social and human rights-based implications. Despite the high burden of meningitis sequelae on people with meningitis, their families and the community, access to both services and support for these conditions is often insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Individuals and families with members disabled by meningitis should be encouraged to seek services and guidance from local and national Organizations of Disabled People (ODPs) and other disability focused organizations, which can provide vital advice about legal rights, economic opportunities and social engagement to ensure people disabled by meningitis are able to live full and rewarding lives.\n\nSurveillance\n\nSurveillance, from case detection to investigation and laboratory confirmation is essential to the control of meningitis. Main objectives include:\n\ndetect and confirm outbreaks;\n\nmonitor the incidence trends, including the distribution and evolution of serogroups and serotypes;\n\nestimate the disease burden;\n\nmonitor the antibiotic resistance profile;\n\nmonitor the circulation, distribution, and evolution of specific strains (clones); and\n\nestimate the impact of meningitis control strategies, particularly preventive vaccination programmes.\n\nWHO response\n\nThe global roadmap Defeating Meningitis by 2030 was developed by WHO with the support of many partners. The strategy was approved in the first ever resolution on meningitis by the World Health Assembly in 2020 and endorsed unanimously by WHO member states.\n\nThe roadmap sets a comprehensive vision \u201cTowards a world free of meningitis\u201d and has 3 visionary goals:\n\nelimination of bacterial meningitis epidemics;\n\nreduction of cases of vaccine-preventable bacterial meningitis by 50% and deaths by 70%; and\n\nreduction of disability and improvement of quality of life after meningitis due to any cause.\n\nWHO is working on the Intersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders in consultation with Member States to address many challenges and gaps in providing care and services for people with epilepsy and other neurological disorders that exist worldwide."}, {"url": "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350508", "page_content": "Overview\n\nMeningitis is an infection and inflammation of the fluid and membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.

The tough outer membrane is called the dura mater, and the delicate inner layer is the pia mater.\n\nViral infections are the most common cause of meningitis. That's followed by bacterial infections and, rarely, fungal and parasitic infections. Because bacterial infections can lead to death, learning the cause is essential.\n\nBacterial meningitis\n\nBacteria that enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain and spinal cord cause bacterial meningitis. But bacterial meningitis also can occur when bacteria directly invade the meninges. This may be caused by an ear or sinus infection, a skull fracture, or \u2014 rarely \u2014 some surgeries.\n\nSeveral strains of bacteria can cause bacterial meningitis, most commonly:\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae. This bacterium is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, young children and adults in the United States. It more commonly causes pneumonia or ear or sinus infections. A vaccine can help prevent this infection.\n\nThis bacterium is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in infants, young children and adults in the United States. It more commonly causes pneumonia or ear or sinus infections. A vaccine can help prevent this infection. Neisseria meningitidis. This bacterium causes a bacterial meningitis called meningococcal meningitis. These bacteria commonly cause an upper respiratory infection but can cause meningococcal meningitis when they enter the bloodstream. This is a highly contagious infection that affects mainly teenagers and young adults. It may cause local epidemics in college dormitories, boarding schools and military bases. A vaccine can help prevent infection. Even if vaccinated, anybody who has been in close contact with a person with meningococcal meningitis should receive an oral antibiotic to prevent the disease.\n\nHaemophilus influenzae. Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacterium was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children. But new Hib vaccines have greatly reduced the number of cases of this type of meningitis.\n\nHaemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacterium was once the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children. But new vaccines have greatly reduced the number of cases of this type of meningitis. Listeria monocytogenes. These bacteria can be found in unpasteurized cheeses, hot dogs and lunchmeats. People who are pregnant, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are most susceptible. During pregnancy, listeria can cross the placenta. Infections in late pregnancy may be fatal to the baby.\n\nViral meningitis\n\nViral meningitis is usually mild and often clears on its own. Most cases in the United States are caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses. They're most common in late summer and early fall. Viruses such as herpes simplex virus, HIV , mumps virus, West Nile virus and others also can cause viral meningitis.\n\nChronic meningitis\n\nChronic meningitis \u2014 one that's long-lasting \u2014 can be caused by slow-growing organisms such as fungi and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They invade the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain. Chronic meningitis develops over two weeks or more. Symptoms are similar to acute meningitis, which is a sudden, new case. They include headache, fever, vomiting and mental cloudiness.\n\nFungal meningitis\n\nFungal meningitis isn't common in the United States. It may mimic acute bacterial meningitis. It's often contracted by breathing in fungal spores that may be found in soil, decaying wood and bird droppings.\n\nFungal meningitis isn't spread from person to person. Cryptococcal meningitis is a common fungal form of the disease. It affects people with weakened immune systems, such as from AIDS . It can cause death if not treated with an antifungal medicine. Even with treatment, fungal meningitis may come back.\n\nParasitic meningitis\n\nParasites can cause a rare type of meningitis called eosinophilic meningitis. Parasitic meningitis also can be caused by a tapeworm infection in the brain or cerebral malaria. Amoebic meningitis is a rare type that is sometimes contracted through swimming in fresh water and can quickly become life-threatening.\n\nThe main parasites that cause meningitis typically infect animals. People are usually infected by eating foods contaminated with these parasites. Parasitic meningitis isn't spread between people.\n\nOther meningitis causes\n\nMeningitis also can result from noninfectious causes. They include chemical reactions, drug allergies, some types of cancer and inflammatory diseases such as sarcoidosis.\n\nRisk factors\n\nRisk factors for meningitis include:\n\nSkipping vaccinations. Risk rises for anyone who hasn't completed the recommended childhood or adult vaccination schedule.\n\nRisk rises for anyone who hasn't completed the recommended childhood or adult vaccination schedule.

The infection increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and premature delivery. Weakened immune system. AIDS , alcohol use disorder, diabetes, use of immunosuppressant drugs and other factors that affect your immune system increase the risk of meningitis. Having a spleen removed also increases risk. People without a spleen should get vaccinated to lower the risk.\n\nComplications\n\nMeningitis complications can be severe. The longer you or your child has the disease without treatment, the greater the risk of seizures and permanent neurological damage, including:\n\nHearing loss.\n\nMemory problems.\n\nLearning disabilities.\n\nBrain damage.\n\nTrouble walking.\n\nSeizures.\n\nKidney failure.\n\nShock.\n\nDeath.\n\nWith prompt treatment, even people with severe meningitis can have good recovery.\n\nPrevention\n\nCommon bacteria or viruses that can cause meningitis can spread through coughing, sneezing, kissing, or sharing eating utensils, a toothbrush or a cigarette.\n\nThese steps can help prevent meningitis:\n\nWash your hands. Careful hand-washing helps prevent the spread of germs. Teach children to wash their hands often, especially before eating and after using the toilet, spending time in a crowded public place or petting animals. Show them how to thoroughly wash and rinse their hands.\n\nCareful hand-washing helps prevent the spread of germs.

Then another grave event, the upris ing in Algiers, which many of the general's friends helped cre ate, pushed the Fourth Republic over the brink and brought him back into office.\n\nThe first volume, to be pub lished by Plon, is expected to be out toward the end of the year. It will trace General de Gaulle's efforts to build a new reptiblic based on strong executive pow er, end the Algerian War and transform France's colonial rela tions in the rest of Africa. The title, \u201cMemoirs of Hope,\u201d is be lieved to express the general's conviction that what he did gave France hope of again playing her rightfully prominent role in the world.\n\nTo write the book, the general became almost a hermit. He would allow few visits or other interruptions, and those who did, have the opportunity to go to his country house in Colombey les\u2010deux\u2010Eglises reported that he was working with relentlessness, even fury, as if the most impor tant thing he could now do was to leave a political testament be hind him.\n\nDe Gaulle\n\nHe would take walks, listen to the radio, watch television and occasionally go for a drive. His wife Yvonne would be seen shop ping in the neighborhood for such things as pastry or breaded pig's feet, for General de Gaulle is a trencherman in a country of trenchermen and, even at the age of 79, his pen is no mightier than his fork.\n\nThe Government furnished the general with a four\u2010room suite of offices on the Left Bank, but he has never visited them, lest his sudden appearance in Paris after so much isolation be interpreted as a political act. His personal archives are stored there, and once a week documents would be taken to Colombey by an aide for use in preparing the memoirs."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/de-gaulle-assassination-plot-leader-executed-at-dawn-1963", "page_content": "Paris, March 10\n\nJean-Marie Bastien-Thiry, the leader of the conspiracy against President de Gaulle on August 22, was executed by a firing squad at 6 42 this morning at Fort d\u2019Ivry, where military executions usually take place.\n\nThe sentences on the other two men who were condemned to death, Alain Bougrenet de la Tocnaye and Jacques Prevost have been commuted by President de Gaulle to life imprisonment.\n\nBastien-Thiry was roused a little before five this morning and told for the first time that his petition to the President to commute his sentence had been rejected, and that the execution was to take place at dawn. He asked about the fate of his two comrades and was told they were not to die.\n\nHe wanted to hear Mass before his execution and also made two new legal objections which he recorded in writing, first that he had again raised the question of the Council of State\u2019s opinion of the legality of the court that judged him, and secondly, that M Bidault\u2019s emergence from secrecy at last made it possible to question him. He had throughout the trial insisted that his orders had come to him from M Bidault\u2019s Council of National Resistance, though he did not say by what route.\n\nHeavily guarded\n\nThe condemned man\u2019s counsel, Maitre Tixier-Vignancour, Maitre Le Coroller and Maitre Dupuy, who were all present, did their best to press these hopeless arguments but after a short consultation, General Gerthoffer, the military prosecutor, insisted that the execution must go forward. This was accepted by Colonel Reboul, who was present to represent the Court \u2013 the presiding judge, General Gardy, was not.\n\nA portrait of lieutenant-colonel Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry on 18 September, 1962.

Photograph: Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images\n\nAfter hearing Mass and taking communion, Bastien-Thiry was driven through the early morning rain under very strong escort to Ivry. He refused to have his eyes bandaged. He was buried immediately after the execution. His grave, in the part of a neighbouring cemetery reserved for the executed, is heavily guarded by the police today.\n\nThe execution of Bastien-Thiry only six days after he was sentenced has come as a shock to French opinion, accustomed to a much more deliberate pace of justice. In fact after the example of ex-General Jouhaud, whose death sentence was commuted months after the trial, every day\u2019s delay would have been taken as strengthening the hypothesis that there would be no execution. \u201cAn inevitable sentence to be followed by inevitable acts of pardon\u201d is the commonest comment on the way the trial had ended. M Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac, one of the great supporters of the regime, had written: \u201cThe fact is that the death penalty has been abolished in the minds and hearts of modern Frenchmen.\u201d\n\nThere was no disputing of the validity of the verdict, or question that the trial was essentially fair, whatever objections could be raised in theory to the nature of the Court. The plot was irrefutably established. Bullets had undoubtedly entered the car within a few inches of the President\u2019s head. The court\u2019s anxiety to let every extenuating factor be argued and testified as the days passed had seemed almost pathological, due, no doubt, to the fact that there was no appeal from the military tribunal\u2019s judgment.\n\nThe President\u2019s decision to let the sentence be carried out surprises first of all because, in spite of the OAS\u2019s abominable record of murder, so few of its members have been executed \u2013 only three in fact, ex-Captain Degueldre, organiser of a killer commando, and two of his subordinates, deserters from the Foreign Legion.\n\nNot only did Salan save his head, thanks to his judges, but in the case of the only other attempt on the President\u2019s life that actually got as far as action, the chief conspirator was let off with a 20-year sentence by the jury, though he had undoubtedly tried to blow up the Chief-of-State and his wife.\n\nThis lack of severity hitherto may well be one of the President\u2019s principal reasons for severity now, especially after the discovery of yet another conspiracy to remove him by violence (the Ecole Militaire affair), and the still mysterious execution of the banker, M. Henri Lafond.\n\nGrim reminder\n\nThis last incident is the more sinister since the precise motive does not yet seem to have come to light. It is possible, too, that M. Bidault may have been a little too successful in his attempt to conceal the OAS under the more elegant and once so honourable title of the National Council of Resistance. The execution is certainly a grim reminder of the nature of OAS activity and what it leads to.\n\nBastien-Thiry was a man with a brilliant future, aged only 35. He was an engineer at the Air Ministry with the equivalent rank of lieutenant-colonel. He leaves a widow and three small daughters. His defence of his action was as much religious as political \u2013 to the considerable distress of the Catholic Church in France.\n\nHe claimed to have sought precedents in \u201cboth ancient and sacred history,\u201d and was undoubtedly a man of great devotion. He does not appear to have joined the OAS until last year after the leadership passed into the hands of M Bidault. His speech in his own defence has already appeared as a pamphlet, and was indeed in his hands when the military prosecutor was asking for the death sentence on him."}]}
