Guitarist Reb Beach was so confident that he \u201cbanked\u201d on the record going gold \u2013 and was forced into a large-scale U-turn when it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe band's self-titled debut LP had introduced the group to the world via the hit singles \u201cHeaded for a Heartbreak\u201d and \u201cSeventeen,\u201d then the follow-up, In the Heart of the Young, continued the streak with \u201cCan't Get Enuff,\u201d \u201cEasy Come Easy Go\u201d and \u201cMiles Away.\u201d But by the time Pull was ready for release, the grunge revolution had changed everything.\n\nIn Tom Beaujour and Richard Bienstock\u2019s new book Nothin' but a Good Time: The Uncensored History of the '80s Hard Rock Explosion, Winger noted that their rise to fame had come thanks to MTV\u2019s support for their \u201cMadalaine\u201d video and an opening slot on tour with Scorpions. \u201cWe got some good touring out of our second record, but the writing was on the wall before it came out,\u201d frontman Kip Winger said. \u201cBad timing.\u201d\n\nKeyboardist and guitarist Paul Taylor added: \u201cWe were starting to notice, like, wow, where\u2019s everybody at the shows? \u2026 I remember it finally hit home in Cincinnati. We had a night off, and I went to see Extreme and Cinderella with David Lee Roth at the Riverbend [Music Center]. And it was half-full. \u2026 David Lee Roth was the ultimate rock star. And now the place is half-empty? I was like, \u2018Whoa. Something's up.\u2019 Because two years prior it would've been sold out.\u201d\n\nBeach agreed with Winger\u2019s \u201cbad timing\u201d analysis. \u201cIf we had come out in \u201986, I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be a very rich man,\" he explained. \"But we came out in '89, right at the tail end. We didn't know it was gonna end. On the third album we were gonna get big publishing advances. If it had done well, I would've made a lot of money. And I banked on that. I figured, it's gotta do well! The last one sold a million and a half records. This one's gotta at least go gold.\u201d\n\nSo, he \"bought a new house and moved the whole fam to Florida. \u2018C\u2019mon, kids! We\u2019re moving to Florida!\u2019 I got a house on a lake with a pool, and you could jump from the pool right into the lake! It was incredible. I was only there for eight months before I had to sell that house. That's how quickly it all went south.\u201d\n\nThe band split in 1994, before reforming briefly in 2001 then more permanently in 2006. They\u2019ve released three more albums since Pull, the most recent being 2014\u2019s Better Days Comin\u2019."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Paul-Taylor-choreographer", "page_content": "Paul Taylor, in full Paul Belville Taylor, (born July 29, 1930, Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, U.S.\u2014died August 29, 2018, New York, New York), American modern dancer and choreographer noted for the inventive, frequently humorous, and sardonic dances that he choreographed for his company.\n\nEntering Syracuse University in 1947 on a scholarship, Taylor took painting classes and joined the swim team. He began dance training in 1951 and subsequently studied modern dance at Juilliard with Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n and ballet with Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske. He began his professional career in 1953 with Martha Graham\u2019s company, creating such important roles as Aegisthus in Clytemnestra (1958), Hercules in Alcestis (1960), and Theseus in Phaedra (1962). He also performed in works by other modern choreographers, including those of Charles Weidman and Merce Cunningham. He danced a solo created for him by George Balanchine in Episodes (1959), a work choreographed by Balanchine and Graham to music by Anton Webern.\n\nAs a choreographer, Taylor utilized a wide variety of movement styles, some of which he described as \u201cflat\u201d (two-dimensional in appearance), \u201cdance scribbling\u201d (emphasis on action rather than on shape or line), and \u201clyric\u201d (\u201clong arms\u201d). His avant-garde works ranged from Duet (1957), in which he and his partner remained motionless for four minutes, to Orbs (1966), an hour-long composition to Beethoven\u2019s last string quartets. Other well-known dances included Three Epitaphs (1956), Aureole (1962), Scudorama (1963), The Book of Beasts (1971), Esplanade and Runes (1975), Cloven Kingdom (1976), Aphrodisiamania (1977), Airs (1978), Nightshade (1979), and Le Sacre du Printemps (1980). His Aureole entered the repertoires of such major ballet troupes as the Paris Op\u00e9ra Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet.\n\nTaylor\u2019s company, established in 1954 and usually numbering 13 dancers, first performed in Europe in 1960, toured South America in 1965 under the International Cultural Exchange Program of the U.S. State Department, and in 1978 toured the U.S.S.R. and appeared on the U.S. public-television network. Taylor also choreographed for the Spoleto (Italy) Festival of Two Worlds and won several prestigious awards.

He passed away on August 29, 2018, at 88 years of age. A spokesperson from the company said it was due to renal failure. Surviving him is a company that he founded, many admiring dance lovers and an American contemporary dance that he had a significant hand in shaping.\n\nIn a choreographic career lasting more than a half century, he created 147 works \u2013 of varying atmospheres, aesthetics and moods \u2013 for his company and others from American Ballet Theatre to Houston Ballet. From the social and human commentary he created in his works, to the lyrical quality of the movement within it, Taylor was a poet. Yet, ever practical, he once remarked that a ticking clock was his muse. Pedestrian movements were often his inspiration.\n\nLincoln Kirstein once said that his work was set apart from all of the \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d modern dance he observed. Taylor\u2019s works had the economy and wit of well-crafted short stories, along with an exquisite craftsmanship in all aesthetic aspects, explains Sarah Kaufman of the Washington Post. He was also entirely unconventional in approach, wearing flannel and jeans while prohibiting mirrors in his studios (claiming that they create \u201cbad habits\u201d).\n\nPaul Belville Taylor Jr. was born outside of Pittsburgh on January 29, 1930. His mother was a businesswoman and his father a physicist, but the family\u2019s fate changed with the coming of the Great Depression. They moved to Washington, where his father managed a hotel and his mother a restaurant. Although his mother had three children from a previous marriage, Taylor grew up \u201cessentially as an only child,\u201d says Kaufman. He directed his curiosity toward insects, the halls of the family\u2019s hotel, and the various characters coming in and out of there.\n\nTaylor attended Syracuse University on partial scholarship in the early 1950s, planning to study painting. Looking for an extracurricular endeavor, he joined the swim team. Alastair Macaulay of The New York Times describes Taylor\u2019s interest in athletic dancers, and athleticism in dance; \u201cmany of his male dancers had powerful musculatures, while many of his female dancers displayed lissomeness, force and boldness.\u201d Yet dance soon replaced swimming as his physical endeavor of focus.\n\nDancing could satisfy a need to expel his physical energy, he said in his 1987 memoir, Private Domain. He studied in Bar Harbor, Maine, in the summer of 1951, while chauffeuring for the dance school where he took classes. He was instantly hooked, Kaufman explains. The following summer, he studied at Connecticut College, with modern dance heavyweights such as Martha Graham, Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n and Doris Humphrey. Taylor transferred to the Juilliard School in New York City, training with other notables such as ballet choreographer Antony Tudor.\n\nUpon graduation, Taylor was successful as a dancer and choreographer fairly quickly. A calmly lyrical mover with both size (standing at 6\u20191) and athletic strength, he caught the attention of Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham. From 1953-55, he was a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, and joined Graham\u2019s company on 1955.\n\nMacaulay explains how Taylor\u2019s modernist aesthetic seemed to be most significantly influenced by Graham but with an important difference; Graham\u2019s technique contained a \u201cforceful expressive tension that it forged between torso and legs\u2026[i]n her work, the body was often excitingly at war with itself[, but i]n his work, that tension would be translated into a vehemently lyrical current.\u201d\n\nWhile dancing in their companies, he created works with collaborators including composer John Cage, and designers Robert Rauschenberg and Alex Katz. George Balanchine choreographed a solo for Taylor, which he performed in New York City Ballet\u2019s season. He left Graham\u2019s company in 1962, in order to focus on his own company, Paul Taylor Dance Company.\n\nHis pragmatic approach remained, yet subject and style shifted over the years. Duet (1957) consisted of he and a partner in stillness for four-and-a-half minutes. Louis Horst\u2019s witty review of the work was simply a blank page. \u201cMy movements are scribbles of what people do,\u201d Taylor remarked in response, \u201cand people do sometimes stand or sit still, you know.\u201d\n\nYet, as Kaufman describes, he came to realize that his works needed to offer music and movement in order to be accessible to a variety of audience members \u2013 and therein keep them in their seats.\n\nPedestrian movement always interested him and guided his work, however, perhaps because he began dancing later in life, Kaufman believes. Taylor\u2019s seminal work, Esplanade (1975), for instance, assembles walking, running, gliding and small, simple leaps \u2013 all set to Bach. Taylor also infused virtuosity in the work, and so many others, however; Esplanade has a richness of pattern as well as speed, in certain sections, that is itself virtuosic, for instance.\n\nDue to hepatitis and ulcers, Taylor retired from the stage in 1974, at 44 years old. He remarked that it was nice \u201cto be just be still and not hurt.\u201d Yet he continued, and in fact deepened his work in, choreographing. Aureole (1962), set to Handel, demonstrated a joyfulness \u2013 one verging on sentimentality \u2013 uncommon in modern dance. It reflected the promise of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s America. Further demonstrating his interest in pedestrian movement and the general quotidian, he gained inspiration for the chilling Last Look (1985) from the darting gazes of a homeless man.\n\nFor many years, the Paul Taylor Dance Company toured internationally through State Department sponsorship. The company gained international fame \u2013 exceeding that of Merce Cunningham or Martha Graham\u2019s companies, despite how Taylor got his start from these modern dance heavyweights, says Kaufman. Taylor alumni include infamous dance names such as Twyla Tharp and Pina Bausch. Taylor founded Taylor 2 in 1994. In 2014, Taylor decided it was time for change and planning for the company surviving him. He renamed it the Paul Taylor American Modern Dance Company, and re-formatted the repertory to also include non-Taylor works from other prominent contemporary choreographers.\n\nThis past March, Taylor appointed Company Dancer Michael Novak as artistic director-designate. Taylor remained involved with the company and making work, however. With Taylor\u2019s passing, the 35-year-old Novak will now head the school and all other entities under the company umbrella \u2013 sooner than expected, remarks Courtney Escoyne of Dance Magazine. Escoyne adds that \u201cMr. Taylor will be missed.\u201d\n\nIndeed, he will be. He once said that making dances is similar to arranging his beloved insect collections, that you shape and rearrange things until they look good \u2013 so very practical, yet so very poetic.\n\nBy Kathryn Boland of Dance Informa."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/paul-taylor-keyboardist", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nPaul Taylor was born on 4 June, 1960 in San Francisco, California, United States, is an American musician, guitarist/keyboardist with Winger.

His One Direction is Got7, the seven-piece K-pop group that was launched in 2014 by one of Korea\u2019s big three entertainment companies, JYP Entertainment.\n\niGot7, the group\u2019s fandom, will know that, despite Wang\u2019s silver-tongued talent as one of Got7\u2019s rappers, he\u2019s a foreign export \u2014 born and raised in Hong Kong by parents who were professional athletes. A gymnast at the young age of seven who picked up fencing when he was 10 years old, he went on to fence for Hong Kong for seven years and qualified for the 2012 London Olympics before his career trajectory took a 180. \u201cSometimes I think it\u2019s fate, because the Korean entertainment casting team came to our school that day. I could have just left after [my] exam but I stayed, playing basketball, and they came at the exact same time,\u201d Wang says. His sporting past is immortalised on his left bicep where the five Olympic rings are imprinted in ink.\n\nVest top, by TEAM WANG. Leather trousers, by DUNHILL.

When it finally came, Wang was in the midst of gearing up for the Asian Junior and Cadet Fencing Championships, and couldn\u2019t relocate to South Korea at the drop of a hat. It was JYP\u2019s turn to wait for him, and they did, for seven months. \u201cIt was hard to persuade my parents [to let me pursue music], because they\u2019re both athletes.\u201d He continues, \u201cThe thing they told me was, \u2018Everyone\u2019s dreaming of being in your position. It\u2019s not easy [to be] where you\u2019re at now.\u2019\u201d As an Olympian in the making with offers from universities knocking on his door, Wang convinced his parents that these crossroads would lead to music. \u201cI just thought: \u2018We only live one life, you never know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow\u2019,\u201d he says.\n\nAfter three years of minting his reputation as Got7\u2019s self-deprecating rapper with a larger-than-life personality and a singer\u2019s chops to boot, Wang took another leap of faith. He set up his record label Team Wang, and launched a solo career. Behind his first single Papillon\u2019s 42 million views on YouTube at press time and its number one spot on Billboard\u2019s China V chart, was a steep learning curve he had to tackle; Wang\u2019s job scope scaled up from artiste to employer and boss, seemingly overnight. \u201cYou know, it was really tough when I started out and there [were] a lot of times that I [would] mentally and physically break down,\u201d he says. \u201cI went through that, and depression. Everything is on [my] back.\u201d He realised that heading up a team meant that music and production wasn\u2019t the entire picture, and that communication and dealing with emotions was part of the work too. He calls it \u201cthe system\u201d \u2014 the process of getting everyone involved on the same page, regardless if their heads are all in different, metaphorical worlds. The upside is that he gets to truly be himself, composing the tracks, writing the lyrics, and at times, co-directing the music videos he releases. \u201cI could be like, \u2018I want this release to be this and that.\u2019 It\u2019s more personal [and] it\u2019s my own true colour,\u201d says Wang.\n\n3 Moncler Grenoble ski suit, $3,770, by MONCLER.

Photo: Yu Cong\n\nKnown for speaking at least four languages \u2014 English, Mandarin, Korean and Cantonese \u2014 fluently, his songs as a solo musician are predominantly in English, but Wang ensures that his Chinese roots have a place in his often synth-inflected releases. The 100 Ways music video takes the love song back several centuries with its cast of Chinese warriors, and his latest single Pretty Please in collaboration with DJ duo Galantis kicks off in a Chinese restaurant with the musician and his crew conversing in Cantonese. Wang is aware that he\u2019s part of a new generation of Asian musicians \u2014 alongside the aforementioned BTS and Blackpink \u2014 that are recognised worldwide, and perceives his music as a vehicle to amplify Chinese culture. \u201cI\u2019m very proud that I\u2019m Chinese, [and] I\u2019m proud that I\u2019m Asian.\u201d He continues, \u201cAs much as I love learning about other cultures, I love sharing mine, and I hope people can relate and see [such a] body of work in the market.\u201d\n\nTogether with Gucci Mane and the hip-hop tune Different Game, he leaned into the genre\u2019s flex culture, albeit through, once again, a Chinese lens. This cross-pollination that he relishes has also brought about tie-ups with other Asian musicians like 88rising\u2019s Joji and Rich Brian, whose entertainment and mass media company\u2019s core purpose is setting Asian artistes up on the world stage \u2014 just like Wang has, under Team Wang, done for himself. Today, he\u2019s irrefutably global; the numbers don\u2019t lie. His first album Mirrors has clocked more than 50 million streams on Spotify, and Pretty Please peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart.\n\n\n\nLeft: T-shirt, $260, by CK CALVIN KLEIN.

It\u2019s a tough grind that sees him dedicating half a year to each camp, and he admits, \u201cIt\u2019s stressful and it\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s something that I really believe in and am in love with. I\u2019m blessed and grateful to be able to do that every day.\u201d\n\nTack onto that yet another project he\u2019s spearheaded and put out into the world in the recent months \u2014 this time clothing. Team Wang Design, the accompanying garment line to his record label, is a tireless move on Wang\u2019s part that catapults him into the same elite space that hip-hop\u2019s most eminent multi-hyphenates occupy \u2014 Kanye West, Travis Scott and Tyler, The Creator have all parlayed their musical prowess into fashion hype. In the thick of it all, Wang\u2019s ambitious, in-it-to-win-it sporting instinct never fails to kick in. He says, \u201cI always have the vision of trying to beat the previous me every time \u2014 with every release.\u201d\n\nShirt and trousers, by XANDER ZHOU.

He reveals what Winger has been up to recently, and looks back at their classic debut and the follow up, In The Heart Of The Young.\n\nOn the new Winger album and writing with Mick Mars\n\nTaylor: \"There\u2019s a new record that\u2019s basically in the can. We\u2019ve all recorded our parts. Right now, it\u2019s all falling on Kip to put it all together. He\u2019s got a symphony he\u2019s going to be releasing, he\u2019s got solo gigs, and we\u2019ve got Winger gigs. There\u2019s a lot of logistics. John\u2019s had Starship gigs, Reb has some gigs coming up with Whitesnake....we\u2019ve had our hands full. Kip is working really hard on it though. He\u2019s doing some final vocal things and all the mixing. It shouldn\u2019t be too much longer, maybe a couple months.\n\nI don\u2019t actually have any songwriting credits on this one. I was writing for some other records. One I can mention is Mick Mars. I wrote a lot of songs with him. It was me, Mick, and Jacob Bunton (who was singing with Steven Adler) writing together. Those are all mixed. I don\u2019t know if and when he is going to release them. We had a good time working on this stuff. They are for his solo album. He\u2019s switched gears a few times in who he wants to work with and what he wants to do. We\u2019re hoping the songs we did with him get released.\n\nMick is a monster. He comes up with some cool, creative stuff. I can\u2019t say too much more about it. I can it\u2019s very musical and very heavy. I think people will be really surprised by it. So I was busy with these other projects, and Kip and Reb are so damn prolific....by the time I was ready to jump in, they had the whole thing written already.\"\n\nOn Winger's debut album\n\nTaylor: \"The debut is probably my favorite out of all the ones we\u2019ve done. The angst, you\u2019re young, and you\u2019ve got your fingers crossed. At the time we were getting to release it, Kip, Reb, and me all moved into an apartment in Hoboken, NJ. I was still playing with Alice Cooper, so I was flying in and out. Rod they had met last minute. So Rod had cut the drums and was part of the band. I never actually met him until the album was completely finished. We all had never played one gig together and we ended up opening for the Scorpions for a month. We had to get it together really quick.\"\n\nOn second album, In The Heart Of The Young\n\nTaylor: \"It was even more progressive sounding until the label got a hold of it. The label heard it and were like 'What\u2019s this?' They said they would release it, but they weren\u2019t going to push it as it was. They wanted some singles. We went back to the drawing board and came up with 'Can\u2019t Get Enough' and 'Easy Come Easy Go'. In the end, they were probably right. We wanted to be all prog rock; not sure what we were thinking then.\n\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s cool about Winger; we can do 'Rainbow In The Rose' and then do 'Can\u2019t Get Enough'. It\u2019s a good blend. With 'Miles Away', I had written that in the early 80\u2019s with Eric Martin singing on it. I think Eric\u2019s voice is what sold it. People who heard it thought it could be a hit. When Kip heard it, he wanted it on the record. Then he turns around and writes the ballad 'Under One Condition', which I thought was amazing. I thought 'Uh oh, there goes my ballad.' Our record company president loved 'Miles Away', though, and wanted it as a single.\""}]}
