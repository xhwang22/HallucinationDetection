He emphasizes York\u2019s successes, but by no means avoids its obstacles and problems. The result is a history that effectively delineates the university as observers and participants broadly saw it over time\u2026Horn\u2019s history is buoyant and optimistic\u2026\u201d\n\n-Paul Stortz, Literary Review of Canada, Vol. 17, No. 2, March 2009\n\nTORONTO, March 26, 2009 -- On Thursday, March 26, 2009, York University marks a momentous occasion\u2014the 50th anniversary of the York University Act. A year-long celebration will include numerous \u201cU50\u201d events showcasing the successes that have been built by the faculty, researchers, students, administrators, and partners from different disciplines over five decades.\n\nAs a memorial for this landmark occasion, York is publishing a history of the university. York University: The Way Must Be Tried is a co-publication with McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press. In 2002, President Lorna Marsden named Michiel Horn, Professor Emeritus of History, Glendon College of York University, as the author of the official history of York University.\n\nYork University: The Way Must Be Tried is a definitive history. Michiel Horn has drawn together the vision and the people who have contributed to the greatness of York. He documents the founding of a brand new university, with 76 students and 50 faculty members, and follows the making of this major institution right through to the position that York University has achieved to date \u2013 the third-largest university in Canada, with 52,000 students enrolled in 11 faculties on two campuses (2007 figures). Horn deftly weaves together the archival research with anecdotes he gleaned from personal interviews with over 250 faculty members, Senate members, Board members, administrative staff, and students to shape his compelling image of York University.\n\nSays Horn, \u201cYork has grown, sometimes according to plan, sometimes haphazardly, sometimes in response to external forces, but almost always in the spirit of (its motto)\u2014\u201cTentanda Via, the way must be tried.\u201d\n\nThe Odyssey Begins\n\nThe institutional odyssey started in 1957 when a group of Toronto business and professional people saw an opportunity to meet the demands for adult education in the fastest-growing city in Canada. With the availability of public funds through the federal government and the anticipated impact of the baby boomers in the 1960s, the organizing committee received the green light to establish a university in federation with the University of Toronto.\n\nOn March 26, 1959, the York University Act received royal assent.\n\nThe Original Vision: A Small Liberal Arts University\n\nFrom the beginning, the establishment of York University was seen as an opportunity to develop a unique intellectual environment. If you were to choose one word to describe York\u2019s ethos, it is \u201cinterdisciplinarity\u201d\u2014\u201cthe commitment of faculty members and students to make an effort to look and reach across disciplinary boundaries in their teaching, learning, and research,\u201d says Horn.\n\nThe first president, Murray G. Ross, conceived of the original vision for York as a small liberal arts university with a program that would focus on \u201cliberal and general education, as opposed to one of specialization.\u201d In early 1962, Ross believed that growth should be slow and guided. However, a report by the Committee of Presidents of the Universities of Ontario warned that enrolment would increase more rapidly than expected. York\u2019s Board of Governors made the decision to expand\u2014the target: 7,000 students by 1970.\n\nWith this decision, Ross ran into opposition from the faculty. This led to one of the first confrontations York would witness between a president and the faculty, with Ross being charged with not living up to earlier agreements. In the end, the board sided with Ross. The incident is now part of York University\u2019s folklore and mythology.\n\nOver the course of Ross\u2019 tenure, York grew enormously. By 1970, 9,000 full-time students and 6,300 part-time undergraduates were enrolled on two campuses. York\u2019s budget had increased to $29 million, with 700 faculty members and 1,700 administration staff. This rapid growth had been demanded by the government and was necessary to meet the demographic realities.\n\nKeele Campus\n\nOn many levels, the rapid growth of York University mirrors the incredible growth of the GTA. Early students on the Keele campus pictured themselves as \u201cpioneers.\u201d The major construction projects under way gave the campus a vital energy. It was brand new and the students themselves were often the first in their families to attend a university\u2014a pattern that continues to this day.\n\nYork University was often prescient in seeing trends ahead of the curve, then building to meet the needs posited by these trends. In 1961, when the Toronto Board of Education stressed the necessity of improved access to higher education for adults, Ross\u2019 long-range vision of an evening college with its own program of study, targeting working people, was justified, and York established the Joseph E. Atkinson College.\n\nIn 1968, Osgoode Hall Law School became a faculty at York. Osgoode developed the reputation for engaging the law with other disciplines in exciting and imaginative ways and this was a major attraction for both faculty and students. In 1971, Osgoode\u2019s operation of Parkdale Community Legal Services became a story of success for the community; by 2005 Ontario had 75 clinics modeled on Parkdale, which was \u201cthe jewel in the crown of the legal clinic system.\u201d\n\nEarly Milestones\n\nIn 1965, York reached two milestones\u2014a new York University Act was passed and the university severed ties to the University of Toronto. York, eager to celebrate its independence, launched its own fundraising campaign, the York University Founders Fund Campaign.\n\nIn 1963, the twenty-year master plan for York University was released: by 1980 the enrolment target would be 20,000 students, 1700 faculty and 3200 other staff members. Glendon would be home to the liberal arts university modelled on US institutions such as Amherst, Atkinson College would continue to develop as planned and the Keele campus would be home to a multi-faculty university with both undergraduate and graduate programs. The total cost for the completion of the complex of buildings necessary to support the master plan came to $150 million\u2014money that would come from the provincial government and the Founders Fund Campaign.\n\nIn 1965, Ross appointed Escott Reid to be the founding principal of Glendon College. Reid proposed that Glendon become bilingual and bicultural\u2014\u201cGlendon College should play a great role in helping to train a new generation of Canadians who would make a better job of relations between English- and French-speaking Canadians than their parents and grandparents.\u201d Students who applied to Glendon were attracted by its small size and by the opportunity to improve or maintain their French-language skills. And Glendon\u2019s public forums attracted political heavyweights such as Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, Ramsay Cook, and Eric Kierans.\n\nThe Meaning of the Historic Events of 1972\n\nThe years 1972/1973 witnessed the most dramatic episode in York\u2019s history. In 1972, York\u2019s deans were in full revolt against President David Slater, and this forced the Board of Governors to secure his resignation. It began in the fall of 1972, when provincial government grants to universities were lower and enrolment had fallen. York seemed to be bucking this trend and the academic planners prepared optimistic forecasts, with \u201creal monies being committed on a hypothetical income.\u201d As a result, a modest rise in enrolment resulted in a $4-million shortfall for York. Slater recommended that the Senate consider the dismissal of tenured and untenured faculty for budgetary reasons. However, his indecision in the face of opposition from the Senate and the faculty called his leadership into question.\n\nIn fact, says Horn, York\u2019s structures were unequal to the challenges caused by the shortfall. People were looking for someone to blame and Slater became the victim. Horn, who was monitoring the meetings with great concern for the welfare and security of the faculty, gives a riveting, first-person account of this struggle.\n\nIn 1974, H. Ian Macdonald, a former Deputy Minister of Economics, was named York\u2019s third president. His greatest challenge\u2014 dealing with the bad press that York had received.\n\nFuture Tense\n\nBy 2008, the Keele campus had changed dramatically. The architectural face of York University has grown. The New Archives of Ontario is currently under construction and the Seymour Schulich Building has been finished. The campus population, which is the equivalent to a city the size of Belleville on a weekday, reflects the multicultural nature of Toronto\u2014the two most prominent groups on campus being those of Chinese and South Asian heritage.\n\nHorn explains that \u201cthe heterogeneity of the student body has presented challenges. The issue of race has been contentious over the years.\u201d A number of high-profile confrontations between groups with conflicting views prompted York University to issue a statement on York Values in 2008 during the celebration of their fifth annual Multi-cultural Week, calling for a \u201creciprocity of respect.\u201d\n\nIn 1992, a report on the future of York University for the coming three decades, entitled 2020 Vision: The Future of York, recommended York become a \u201ccomprehensive university, developing its own distinctive idiom with a focus on growth...\u201d In this quest, York has become more research-intensive. Current President Mamdouh Shoukri is committed to raising York\u2019s research profile in health and the pure sciences and engineering. With the successful launch of the Faculty of Health, York has now positioned itself to make a case for a medical school.\n\nToday, universities focus on public-private partnerships that work toward practical applications. To this end, two faculties will be merged on July 1, 2009, to form the Faculty of Liberal Arts and Professional Studies\u2014Atkinson College and the Faculty of Arts. Horn sees this as a unique opportunity to re-shape the university\u2019s future in the 50th anniversary year.\n\nInternationally, York University\u2019s strengths are perceived to be the social sciences, the fine arts, the Seymour Schulich School of Business and Osgoode Hall Law School. With the growth of transnational corporations, business schools have had to develop a global approach. By 2006, the Seymour Schulich School of Business had opened training centres in Beijing, Mumbai, Seoul, and a corporate governance centre in Moscow. A number of influential organizations rank universities. Business schools live and die by these rankings and Schulich has performed well\u2014it has been ranked first in Canada for the MBA programs for the sixth straight year by The Economist, and The Wall Street Journal ranks Schulich Number One in Canada and eleventh in the world.\n\nIn the past decade, York has increased its support of research in response to the recommendations of the 2020 Vision report. Already a leader in Knowledge Mobilization, York is home to high-powered research centres that make up the Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science (CRESS). Biochemist and molecular biologist Ronald Pearlman notes that \u201c\u2026the pursuit of funding is highly competitive, but York has done well\u2026 insiders and granting agencies know that York has a strong and well-deserved reputation in science.\u201d\n\nYork\u2019s achievements may also be measured by the success of its fundraising campaigns. The target for the current Power of 50 fundraising campaign is $200 million\u2014an enormous increase over the original York University Founders Fund Campaign, whose goal was $15 million. Over the years, York\u2019s remarkable stature has attracted a large amount of philanthropic support and by 2008, the Power of 50 campaign had already raised more than three quarters of its goal.\n\nMichiel Horn is Professor Emeritus of History, Glendon College of York University. A prolific author and editor, his most recent publications are the award-winning Academic Freedom in Canada: A History (1999), and the English-language translations of a novel by Dutch author Maarten \u2019t Hart, The Sundial (De zonnewijzer) (2004) and a work by sociologist Benjo Maso, Sweat of the Gods: Myths and Legends of Bicycle Racing (Het zweet der goden: legende van de wielersport) (2005).\n\nYork University is the leading interdisciplinary research and teaching university in Canada. York offers a modern, academic experience at the undergraduate and graduate level in Toronto, Canada\u2019s most international city. The third largest university in the country, York is host to a dynamic academic community of 50,000 students and 7,000 faculty and staff, as well as more than 200,000 alumni worldwide. York\u2019s 11 faculties and 26 research centres conduct ambitious, groundbreaking research that is interdisciplinary, cutting across traditional academic boundaries. This distinctive and collaborative approach is preparing students for the future and bringing fresh insights and solutions to real-world challenges. York University is an autonomous, not-for-profit corporation.\n\n-30-\n\nIf you would like further information about York University: The Way Must Be Tried or if you are interested in scheduling an interview with author Michiel Horn, please contact:\n\nDiane Hargrave\n\n416-467-9954, ext. 104\n\ndhprbks@interlog.com\n\n\u201cYORK UNIVERSITY: The Way Must Be Tried\u201d\n\nBy Michiel Horn\n\n315 pages; colour throughout\n\n$49.95 hardcover\n\nPublication date: March 26, 2009\n\nYork University in association with\n\nMcGill-Queen\u2019s University Press\n\nISBN: 978-0-7735-3416-2"}, {"url": "https://www.oeaw.ac.at/resources/Record/9781487579586", "page_content": "Summary:\n\nThe opportunity to create a university has not been presented frequently; when it comes it is bound to offer an exciting and vital challenge to the leaders, to the faculty, to the students who undertake such an important adventure. As the numbers wishing to attend university continue to increase, it becomes clear that there are going to have to be more and more opportunities to create new institutions of higher learning. What should be the guiding principles of these foundations? Should they follow the time-honoured patterns of venerable universities and colleges? Or should they think rather in terms of today and of special needs related to specials problems of contemporary society? What capabilities and interests should they seek to develop in the particular groups of students which will form their constituencies? Dr. Murray G. Ross, President of York University, which welcomed its first students in the autumn of 1960, has provided in this book a stimulating analysis of the present expansion in university education in Canada, and has outlined against this background the response which York University in particular is attempting to make to the challenge presented to it. He discusses the vexed question of the appropriate size of new institutions and analyses carefully the aims of university training and essential ingredients in administration, in faculty, in the student body which will make a genuine contribution to education possible. The chapters give forceful and convincing expression to the President's belief in the special need today for really vigorous thinking and inquiry at every level of the university community. He calls for the exercise of imagination, of inventiveness, of courage in planning and execution of the new universities. This is the time for a bold, creative thrust in education.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.yorku.ca/laps/2016/06/15/murray-g-ross-recipient-a-respected-student-leader/", "page_content": "When York University President and Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri called undergrad Sayjon Ariyarathnam, the fourth-year BA student was surprised \u2014 he wasn\u2019t expecting to receive congratulations for earning the highly prestigious Murray G. Ross Award.\n\nThe award is the highest honour given to a graduating undergradate student at York, and recognizes both academic distinction and notable contributions to campus life. The award will be presented to Ariyarathnam during spring convocation ceremonies.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d said Ariyarathnam. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an honour.\u201d\n\nAriyarathnam will graduate with a BA (honours) in Criminology and Human Rights & Equity Studies after completing four years at York University. He \u201cbelongs to a rare league of students who demonstrate excellence in and outside of the classroom,\u201d said nominator Marilyn Lambert-Drache, associate vice-president International, noting he has an \u201cacademic record that speaks for itself\u201d.\n\nHe is the recipient of numerous awards, including the prestigious York University President\u2019s Scholarship (which he received every year since 2012), and the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies (LA&PS) Dean\u2019s Award for Academic Excellence. More recently, Ariyarathnam earned the Robert Tiffin Award for Student Leadership, and this past fall was selected as the winner for the York University President for a Day contest.\n\n\u201cYork has been great to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve really had great experiences here, especially with leadership opportunities.\u201d\n\nAriyarathnam wasted no time getting acquainted with extra-curricular activities on campus, and in his first year became involved in campus groups including Student Council of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies; the York University Tamil Student Association; York University Senate and more. The list of his participation in campus and student life is lengthy, and to him, extremely fulfilling.\n\nHe\u2019s also proud, and grateful, for the international opportunities York has offered him \u2013 through various affiliations he\u2019s travelled to China, Japan, and this summer will set off to Viet Nam.\n\n\u201cThis has happened all through York University,\u201d he said.\n\nAriyarathnam will graduate in the spring, but returns in the fall to start on his next academic path: a JD/MBA at Osgoode Hall Law School.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud to be coming back in September to be on campus for another four years,\u201d he said.\n\nSupporting his nomination for the award was Livy Visano, LA&PS professor and undergraduate program director. In his letter, he states \u201cI am proud to note that I rank Mr. Ariyarathnam easily among the top two per cent of all students that I have taught (undergraduate and graduate) over my 30 years of teaching and three different universities. He is without exception, among the most industrious and most professional students I have ever met.\u201d\n\nVisano speaks highly of Ariyarathnam\u2019s advising and mentoring of other students, praising him for his level of modesty and integrity, and calls him \u201cone of the most respected student leaders at York University\u201d.\n\nAriyarathnam said he finds genuine gratification in mentoring other students, and spends his free time doing just that in his own community as well.\n\n\u201cI tutor high school kids and teach music,\u201d he said. \u201cI love to connect with students.\u201d\n\nAriyarathnam said after completing his JD/MBA, he hopes to pursue a career doing corporate and international law for an NGO, and \u201clearn the industry\u201d. Over the long term, he sees a return to academia, and perhaps a PhD and he hopes a future as a professor in law.\n\nThe Murray G. Ross Award was established by the student council in 1962 in honour of York University\u2019s first president.

Today is a very special day for us and for the entire university. It is about big ideas, big minds, big hearts, big ambition and big future. Today, we are formally opening the Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence, the home of the Renaissance engineer. It is a terrific opportunity for us to celebrate those who contributed to this project and those who are benefitting from this project.\u201d\n\nKnown for its stunning architectural design, the Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence is the physical home of the Lassonde School of Engineering, which is dedicated to educating and inspiring the next generation of engineers by fostering creativity and hands-on learning.\n\nThe award-winning building was designed by Toronto\u2019s ZAS Architects + Interiors, built by UK-based construction firm Laing O\u2019Rourke in partnership with the Gillam Group and named in recognition of York alumnus Douglas Bergeron and his wife Sandra for their $10 million donation. The provincial government invested $50 million in the construction of this advanced learning and research centre. An additional $5-million donation was given to the building by philanthropist Ignat Kaneff.\n\nA striking facility, which overlooks the Stong Pond on York University\u2019s Keele campus, the 169,500-sq-ft centre with five floors and a green rooftop, boasts a facade of 8,000 triangular metal panels and windows in a mathematically derived Penrose pattern that never repeats. The design drew its inspiration from Georgian Bay and the iconic Canadian image of a cloud floating over a rock.\n\nThe building is primarily home to the University\u2019s three newest engineering programs \u2013 civil, mechanical and electrical.\n\n\u201cThe Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence is a truly forward-looking, uniquely designed facility that will offer our engineering students unsurpassed experiential learning opportunities,\u201d said York University President & Vice-Chancellor Mamdouh Shoukri, in his opening remarks. \u201cThe centre is an exciting addition to campus life at York \u2013 one that will give our students a distinct advantage through access to flexible, collaborative learning spaces and research labs. This is how students prefer to learn today, and we\u2019re proud to be able to provide facilities that support and reflect 21st century education.\u201d\n\nShoukri told the story about how the provincial government, in partnership with the University and with the support provided by the principal donors, made the building and school a reality. Shoukri, who is an engineer by training and a professor in the Lassonde School of Engineering, spoke about his own passion for the engineering school and the joy of a dream fulfilled.\n\nNext to the podium was Ontario\u2019s Minister of Training, Colleges & Universities, Reza Moridi. Educated as an engineer, Moridi spoke with pride about the role the new centre and program will play in the province\u2019s economy.\n\n\u201cOur government is proud to support York\u2019s Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence, a facility that is providing the next generation of engineers with the expertise they need to thrive in Ontario\u2019s knowledge-based economy,\u201d said Moridi to those gathered for the opening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased that within this cutting-edge new learning space, York is advancing an innovative curriculum that is giving students access not only to training across a variety of engineering disciplines, but also to a number of critical skills employers are looking for like entrepreneurship, collaboration and creativity,\u201d said Moridi. \u201cI look forward to seeing the contributions future graduates will make to our society and to our economy as they turn these skills into high value jobs.\u201d\n\nDesigned with students in mind, there are no lecture halls. Instead, there are several active learning areas which offer students, who hail from Peel Region, North York, York Region, Toronto, and far beyond, the latest in learning technology and a place to tackle real world issues.\n\nThe first-floor \u201cHigh Bay Lab\u201d was primarily created for civil engineering research to test the strength of materials such as concrete to see, for example, if it can withstand an earthquake. The second-floor \u201cSandbox\u201d is a student space designed to allow the free-flow of ideas, many of which can then be turned into a prototype using one of the onsite 3D printers. The idea is to get students from various programs and disciplines interacting to develop innovative solutions and create new concepts.\n\nThe centre is also home to the Bergeron Entrepreneurs in Science & Technology (BEST) program created by the Bergerons. BEST integrates curricular and experiential activities to develop business skills and help students understand what it takes to launch a technology start-up enterprise.\n\n\u201cTomorrow\u2019s entrepreneurial engineers need to be open-minded collaborators working with talented people from a variety of fields,\u201d said Bergeron. \u201cThe Bergeron Centre for Engineering Excellence gives students the freedom to think creatively, to imagine solutions that defy conventional wisdom and to take their ideas from sketches on a whiteboard into real world technology ventures.\u201d\n\nThe building is expected to receive LEED Gold accreditation in recognition of its environmental performance and sustainable design.\n\nIn his comments, philanthropist and entrepreneur Pierre Lassonde, whose donation of $25 million established the engineering school bearing his name. \u201cThe most precious natural resource our country has is the human ingenuity of its people,\u201d said Lassonde. \u201cToday we are celebrating human ingenuity.\u201d\n\nLassonde spoke with passion about the need to bring more young women into engineering and the school\u2019s progress toward its goal of having 50 per cent of its student population represented by young women. \u201cWe are making progress to becoming the first engineering school in North America to do this,\u201d he said.\n\nIn closing, York University Chancellor Greg Sorbara took time to pay special tribute to the hundreds of men and women who did the physical work to build the Bergeron Centre. \u201cWe made history today,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://yfile.news.yorku.ca/2020/07/02/murray-g-ross-award-recipient-describes-undergraduate-studies-as-rich-academic-experience/", "page_content": "Along with earning a BSc (specialized honours) in the Kinesiology and Health Science Program, recent alumnus Aly Fawzy is also the recipient of York University\u2019s Murray G. Ross Award, one of the highest honours for a graduating student.\n\nThe award, which is typically presented during spring convocation, recognizes one student for outstanding academic excellence and notable contributions to the University.\n\n\u201cI have had the pleasure of working with Aly in his role as a president\u2019s ambassador and witnessing first-hand his passion for improving the student experience at York,\u201d said President and Vice-Chancellor Rhonda L. Lenton. \u201cAn engaged campus leader who lives his values, Aly has made a profound impact on student life at the University and I look forward to seeing what he accomplishes next.\u201d\n\nDuring his time at York, which he describes as a \u201crich academic experience,\u201d Fawzy took several upper year kinesiology electives and pursued practical research activities. He received an Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA) from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) to conduct vascular research with Professor Tara Haas using molecular biology techniques. His work was presented as a poster in a research conference at the University, and he went on to complete his undergraduate honours thesis with Haas.\n\n\u201cI presented my work as an undergraduate thesis manuscript, which taught me a lot about scientific writing,\u201d said Fawzy.\n\nOutside the classroom, Fawzy was immersed in many student success programs and student clubs, many at Stong and Calumet Colleges. He was a peer tutor and a peer mentor with the Kinesiology and Health Science student Organization (KAHSSO), and become president of KAHSSO in his fourth year, overseeing its free peer tutoring and peer mentoring programs and student success events. Fawzy also held roles as a president\u2019s ambassador, a student health ambassador and an executive at two student clubs: The Canadian Association of Research in Regenerative Medicine (CARRM) and SickKids. Additionally, he held governance positions including as a student representative at the Faculty of Health petitions committee and the Faculty of Health Council. He also sat on the Student Success Council at Stong and Calumet Colleges.\n\nA point of pride for Fawzy is his role in the creation of the Ambassador Program under KAHSSO with the help of the executive council and support of Stong and Calumet colleges. The program, he said, was initially created to enhance events on campus, but is now evolving to go beyond campus and engage high school students as well create a kinesiology alumni network and many other initiatives in the local community geared around mental health and career exploration.\n\n\u201cIt is really difficult for me to pinpoint one learning experience that was most valuable,\u201d said Fawzy. \u201cRather, the most valuable things I learned came from my mentors at York University, outside the classroom. My time interacting and working with Drs. Mazen Hamadeh (Head of Stong College), Jennine Rawana (Head of Calumet College), and Tara Haas (Kinesiology Professor) as well as President Lenton when I was a president\u2019s ambassador were the most valuable learning experiences for me at York. I learned a wide range of skills ranging from leadership, communication and networking to culturing cells and working with mice models for research.
