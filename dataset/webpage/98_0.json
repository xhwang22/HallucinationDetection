Smith was hired on January 31, 2013.\n\nSince joining the Steelers in 2015, kicker Chris Boswell is 202-of-234 overall on field goal attempts (86.3%), including 90-of-115 (78.3%) from 40 yards or longer. He ranks fifth in field goal percentage (86.3%) among all NFL kickers with at least 200 field goal attempts in league history. Boswell's 86.3 field goal percent ranks second in Steelers history among kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, behind only Shaun Suisham (2010-14: 124-141 for 87.9%). He has registered a franchise-record 10 career game-winning field goals (last five min. of the fourth quarter or overtime for a lead change).\n\nIn 2022, Boswell made 20 field goals for the sixth time in his career, despite missing five games with an injury. His 59-yard field goal against the NY Jets in Week 4 tied the longest make of his career. In Week 17 at Baltimore, Boswell became the second player in team history withat least 200 career field goals made.\n\nIn 2021, Boswell broke his own franchise record for most field goals made in a season in Steelers history (36). He also converted 8-of-9 attempts from 50+ yards, doubling his previous record of four makes from 50+ yards in a single season (2017).\n\nSmith also oversaw the development of rookie punter Pressley Harvin in 2021. Harvin finished 10th in the League, landing 25 punts inside the 20-yard line as a rookie.\n\nUnder the guidance of Smith, Boswell made 19 field goals on 20 attempts (95.0%) in 2020, the best field goal percentage of his career in a single season. From 2019-2020, Boswell connected on 25-straight field goal attempts, which was the longest streak in the NFL when it ended in Week 11 of 2020 at Jacksonville.\n\nBoswell made 29 of his 31 field goal attempts (93.5%) in 2019, including 29 of 30 from inside 54 yards and 10 of 12 from 40+ yards. He ranked tied for third in the NFL in field goals made, tied for fourth in field goals attempted and fourth in points (115). Among NFL kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, Boswell ranked second in field goal percentage.\n\nBoswell was the only kicker in 2019 that did not miss an extra-point attempt (28 of 28) and connected on at least 90% of his field goal attempts. He was the first NFL kicker to accomplish the feat since 2017 and fifth to do so since 2015, when the extra-point attempt was moved to the 15-yard line.\n\nWide receiver and punt returner Diontae Johnson excelled under Smith's tutelage in 2019. The rookie led the NFL in punt-return average (12.4). Johnson was the fifth player in franchise history to lead the League and first since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. He returned a punt 85 yards for a TD at Arizona in Week 14, which was the longest punt return for a TD in franchise history. It was the first punt-return TD for the Steelers since December 6, 2015 (Antonio Brown vs. Indianapolis). Johnson was the first Pittsburgh rookie with a punt return for a TD since December 17, 2006 (Santonio Holmes vs. Carolina).\n\nBoswell landed 13 successful field goals in 2018, following a 2017 season where he earned his first Pro Bowl selection after a record-setting campaign. Boswell established single-season franchise records for the most field goals made (35) and total points (142) during the 2017 season, in addition to setting a team record for the most field goals made from 50 yards or further in a season with four. His 35 field goals made and 142 points surpassed the previous milestones of Norm Johnson set in 1995 (34 and 141). Boswell converted four game-winning field goal attempts \u2014 kicks within one minute of regulation \u2014 during the 2017 regular season.\n\nIn 2016, Boswell tied the franchise's regular-season record for the most field goals made in a single game with 6 (12/18 at Cincinnati). Also in that contest, he set the franchise record for most field goals made from 40 yards or longer in a single game (5). Since 1960, his 5 made field goals from 40 yards or longer are tied for the most in a single game in NFL history (Mason Crosby, 11/22/15).\n\nBoswell also set the NFL and Steelers record for most field goals made in a single postseason game (6) at Kansas City in the AFC Divisional Playoff. At the end of the 2016 postseason, Boswell was a perfect 15-of-15 in his playoff career. He became the first player in NFL postseason history to covert each of his first 15 field goal attempts.\n\nThough Boswell had never kicked in an NFL game prior to his 2015 Steelers debut, he made 29 field goals and 26 PATs for a total of 113 points in just 12 games. He set rookie/first-year single-season team records in field goals made (29), points (113) and field goal percentage (90.6). Boswell's 29 made field goals tied for fifth on the team's single-season field goals made chart.\n\nPrior to the 2015 regular season, the Steelers lost kicker Shaun Suisham for the season in the team's first preseason contest due to a knee injury. Pittsburgh then went through two other kickers (Garrett Hartley and Josh Scobee) before signing Boswell prior to the team's Week 5 game.\n\nThrough his first five years in the NFL and with the Steelers, punter Jordan Berry owns the team's single-season regular season record for highest net punting average (40.9, 2019). He ranks third in franchise history with a 44.2 punting average (min. 100 punts) and second in team annals with 131 punts inside the opponent 20-yard line.\n\nBerry, who recorded a franchise record 40.9 net punting average, averaged a career-best 45.5 yards per punt in 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Berry tallied a 38.8 net punting average coming off a 2017 season in which he posted the second-best mark in team history with a 39.8 average.\n\nIn 2016, Berry set the team's single regular-season record for highest net punting average (40.2) and became the seventh Steeler in team history to land 50 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line in their career.\n\nDuring the 2015 season, Berry established a Steelers' single-season record (since 1976) for the highest percentage of punts downed inside the 20-yard line (47.5). That percentage also placed him third in the NFL.\n\nIn 2014, Smith got solid efforts from Suisham and punter Brad Wing. Suisham made 29-of-32 field goal attempts and all 45 of his PATs for a total of 132 points, good for fourth in the AFC. Wing averaged 43.7 yards per punt in his debut NFL season in 2014. His gross punting average was the fifth-highest total in team history for a rookie or first-year player in a single season.\n\nIn the Steelers' Week 17 showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals, the AFC North Championship was on the line. Smith's punt return units cleared the way for Antonio Brown to return a punt 71 yards for a TD. It marked the second straight season Brown returned a punt for a TD against Cincinnati.\n\nIn Smith's first season as the Steelers' special teams coordinator in 2013, Suisham had a career year, connecting on 30-of-32 field goals, which are a career high and are tied for the third-most field goals made in a single season in Steelers history. His 93.8 field goal percentage (minimum 15 attempts) also set a new single-season team record.\n\nIn addition to being selected to the Pro Bowl as a wide receiver in 2013, Brown was also selected as a return specialist. He recorded a 67-yard punt return for a TD in Week 15 versus Cincinnati, which was one of his five returns of 40 or more yards on the season.\n\nPrior to joining Pittsburgh, Smith served as the Washington Football Team's special teams coordinator from 2004-2012. He helped establish Washington's special teams as one of the top coverage and return units in the NFL.\n\nPrior to joining the Washington Football Team, Smith was the special teams coordinator for the Buffalo Bills (2001-03), coached tight ends for the Detroit Lions (1999-2000), and he split duties as the defensive backs and special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles (1995-98).\n\nSmith spent eight years (1987-94) as an assistant coach for Georgia Tech, where he coached running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. He was on the staff for the Yellow Jackets' 1990 team that was named co-NCAA National Champions.\n\nSmith played defensive back for Edinboro State College from 1972-1976, and he was elected to the Edinboro University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHis first collegiate coaching position came as a graduate assistant at his alma mater in 1976. Smith also was a defensive graduate assistant coach at Clemson University (1979), The College of William & Mary (1980-83) and The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina (1984-86)."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/danny-smith-coach", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nDanny Smith was born on 7 November, 1953 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, is an American football coach.

If there was a coach to exemplify that on the Steelers, it would be hard to point to anyone other than Danny Smith. Smith, 68, who was hired all the way back in 2013, has been coaching football for nearly 50 years \u2014 and he has no plans of retiring any time soon.\n\nSmith\u2019s first job came all the way back in 1976 when he was a graduate assistant for his alma mater, Edinboro University. Smith played for Edinboro from 1972 to 1976, and Smith is a hometown guy. He played at Central Catholic, took Dan Marino under his wing, and simply knows nothing but football. He has made stops all over the coaching map but made the special teams jump in 1995 when he joined the Eagles.\n\nThe Steelers job opened up following the 2012 season, however, and Smith was the obvious choice. At his age, it could be easy to see Smith potentially moving on and sipping Pina Coladas on the beach in retirement. However, he says that will not be happening anytime soon. Instead, Smith is going to continue until he knows he simply can not go any longer. After all, the only game and thing that Smith knows is football. He has been around the game his entire life, and leaving now just does not fit his bill well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a lifer, man,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t have any hobbies. I\u2019m not a golfer or a traveler. That\u2019s a pain in the ass anymore. I don\u2019t know what the hell I would do if I didn\u2019t have this place and football. You probably are going to see me crawl off this field one day. I don\u2019t have any plans. I\u2019m good to go. I love it. I\u2019m prepared for it. I\u2019m forever.\u201d\n\nSmith is not going to walk away from the team anytime soon, and his players would not have it any other way. Gunner Olszewski is new to the Steelers, but Smith is already making a big-time statement on him. There is a myriad of traits that sticks out about Smith to Olszewski. While he may not be on Smith\u2019s level with the gum-chewing just yet, he is certainly taking lessons from everything that Smith is telling him. Coming from a football lifer, that makes it all the more meaningful.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d Olszewski said of working with Smith. \u201cThe bank of knowledge that he has, you can ask him anything. You can tell how much that dude loves football. If you ask him, he\u2019ll say he hates football. But only people who absolutely love football will say they hate football. He knows so much about the game and is willing to share it all. You can get him going easily by talking about a punt block or field goal block. He just loves it.\u201d\n\nIt appears that Smith is going nowhere. The Steelers are content with having Smith\u2019s energy, and gum-chewing skills around for as long as possible. He will look to continue a string of successful seasons on special teams while trying to replace Ray-Ray McCloud\u2019s presence at punt returner.\n\nRELATED: Danny Smith Says Chris Boswell Will Get a New Contract Soon"}, {"url": "https://www.idolbirthdays.net/danny-smith", "page_content": "Does Danny Smith Dead or Alive?\n\nAs per our current Database, Danny Smith is still alive (as per Wikipedia, Last update: May 10, 2020).\n\n\ud83c\udf82 Danny Smith - Age, Bio, Faces and Birthday\n\nCurrently, Danny Smith is 69 years, 7 months and 2 days old.

I definitely want to keep coaching,\" he said. \"Right now, I'm going to be the best employee/teacher at Baker that I can be until my time is up.

Baker will always be a special place to me.\"\n\nSmith and his wife, Michele, were married on the Baker football field in 2016.\n\nHe was 15-19 in his fourth season as the team's head coach. The Hornets made the playoffs once in that span, going 6-5 in 2016 and losing to Enterprise 51-14 in the first round.\n\nSmith spent 26 years as an assistant coach - all in Mobile - before being named Baker's head coach when Jack French retired in July of 2015.\n\nHis stops have included Shaw, St. Paul's, Davidson and two stints at Baker.

I remember them all.\u201d\n\nFrench said he would remain in Mobile in retirement and spend time with his wife Karen and his two grandchildren.

I am going to attack this from Day 1. I already have met with the coaches individually and the staff as a whole. We are going to hit the ground running. At the same time, I know this program is not broke. We won nine games and went to the playoffs last year. We are going to build on that.\u201d\n\nFrench told the team Monday morning that he was stepping down, and Smith was taking over. Smith said it was an emotional meeting that led to a \"great\" practice. He said inside linebackers coach Steve Normand would take over as defensive coordinator and Grady McClusky would be offensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cJack brought a hard-nosed, physical demeanor to this program,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI want to extend from that. I want to win a state championship at Baker High School. I am going to surround myself with guys who are driven.

The enthusiastic and fiery personality of Smith has always caused me to smile and think about two other NFL coaches. The first is former Philadelphia Eagles and St. Louis Rams Head Coach Dick Vermeil. The other is current Seattle Seahawks Head Coach Pete Carroll. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I neglected to mention that both of those gentlemen have a Lombardi Trophy residing at the center of their trophy cases. That common denominator seems to bode well for Danny Smith.\n\nAt the beginning of our conversation, I mentioned that special teams could be a positive or negative component on any NFL team in terms of the year-by-year performance of the players assigned to special teams. Smith pointed out that: \u201cIt can be a hard evaluation process, especially for new players coming out of college, because college punt coverage is different than NFL punt coverage.\u201d\n\nHe continues on: \u201cThe footwork, the assignments and the rules of coverage. They\u2019re a lot different in college, so when you get young guys coming in trying to transition to the NFL, they\u2019re trying hard but they\u2019re just working at what they were taught.\u201d\n\nAlthough many special teamers may be destined for future NFL stardom, Smith says that there is a time-honored process that determines what first-year players or any other players will be placed on special teams. \u201cThose decisions are made after a long training camp and the three preseason games that we play. That is where our evaluation process has an advantage over colleges. Sorting (through) some of that stuff is not the part that\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s teaching them the skill set. Carrying out the details of an assignment at this level sometimes can be difficult. Teams in the NFL have great reputations: not only for special teams that can provide a spark for their offense but for their defense as well.\u201d\n\nWe also talked about the occasions that may dictate that a specific game plan to defend against a star wide receiver for the opposing team that might be back to receive punts or kicks. Smith talked about when the offense of the Black and Gold is set to receive the ball and how game plans are created to neutralize an opposing team\u2019s defensive standout that can potentially break up your blocking wedge at best, creating poor field position or at the very worst, create a turnover for the opposition. \u201cIt\u2019s about matchups and we have the same stars as they do but the NFL is a game of matchups.\u201d\n\nWhen Danny Smith refers to matchups, a perfect example that comes to mind for me was a 2007 Monday Night Football matchup between the Steelers and Ravens. In that game, James Harrison had a potential Hall of Fame performance. \u201cDeebo\u201d was simply a walking wrecking ball on defense and special teams that will more than likely never be repeated. He recorded 3.5 sacks, six quarterback hits, three forced fumbles and an interception as the Steelers battered the Ravens, 38-7.\n\nWhen I reflect on that Steelers/Ravens game, Danny Smiths words are ringing in my ears in an almost prophetic-like fashion\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s about matchups and we have the same stars and the NFL is a game of matchups\u2026\u201d\n\nWell in this case it was not about matchups because on that fateful Monday night in 2007 at Heinz Field, the Baltimore Ravens could not in any way, shape or form find a matchup to stop James Harrison. The performance by Harrison also possibly provided a shot in the arm for Steelers\u2019 first-year Head Coach Mike Tomlin. When we push the fast forward button, in January of 2013, Tomlin hired Danny Smith as the Steelers\u2019 Special Teams Coordinator. Since he was hired, Smith, with his wisdom and energy, has become the perfect fit for the Steelers.\n\nDanny Smith recognizes and realizes the \u201cguillotine syndrome\u201d associated with being a special teams coach: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to come back on the next play,\u201d he says in a rather matter-of-fact manner. \u201cWhatever happened on the (previous play) has to be corrected, immediately. We have a one-play series and one shot. We\u2019ve been consistent and will continue to be. You\u2019re always looking for the big play. We created a few of them a year ago, but that don\u2019t mean a damn thing about this year.\u201d\n\nDanny Smith is the perfect man for the almost perfect job in the Pittsburgh Steelers coaching hierarchy. Why? Well, because he is not covertly using his job as a springboard or stepping stone to be elevated to a higher coaching position elsewhere. He is satisfied and proud of his coaching performance, as he should be. He is valued and appreciated by the players, the coaches and the fans.

It\u2019s unknown when exactly Smith tested positive and if he was symptomatic.\n\nQuarterbacks coach Matt Canada, whose positive diagnosis was also revealed on Saturday, has already returned to the team."}, {"url": "https://www.steelers.com/team/coaches-roster/danny-smith", "page_content": "Danny Smith is in his 11th season with the Steelers as the special teams coordinator. Smith was hired on January 31, 2013.\n\nSince joining the Steelers in 2015, kicker Chris Boswell is 202-of-234 overall on field goal attempts (86.3%), including 90-of-115 (78.3%) from 40 yards or longer. He ranks fifth in field goal percentage (86.3%) among all NFL kickers with at least 200 field goal attempts in league history. Boswell's 86.3 field goal percent ranks second in Steelers history among kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, behind only Shaun Suisham (2010-14: 124-141 for 87.9%). He has registered a franchise-record 10 career game-winning field goals (last five min. of the fourth quarter or overtime for a lead change).\n\nIn 2022, Boswell made 20 field goals for the sixth time in his career, despite missing five games with an injury. His 59-yard field goal against the NY Jets in Week 4 tied the longest make of his career. In Week 17 at Baltimore, Boswell became the second player in team history withat least 200 career field goals made.\n\nIn 2021, Boswell broke his own franchise record for most field goals made in a season in Steelers history (36). He also converted 8-of-9 attempts from 50+ yards, doubling his previous record of four makes from 50+ yards in a single season (2017).\n\nSmith also oversaw the development of rookie punter Pressley Harvin in 2021. Harvin finished 10th in the League, landing 25 punts inside the 20-yard line as a rookie.\n\nUnder the guidance of Smith, Boswell made 19 field goals on 20 attempts (95.0%) in 2020, the best field goal percentage of his career in a single season. From 2019-2020, Boswell connected on 25-straight field goal attempts, which was the longest streak in the NFL when it ended in Week 11 of 2020 at Jacksonville.\n\nBoswell made 29 of his 31 field goal attempts (93.5%) in 2019, including 29 of 30 from inside 54 yards and 10 of 12 from 40+ yards. He ranked tied for third in the NFL in field goals made, tied for fourth in field goals attempted and fourth in points (115). Among NFL kickers with at least 30 field goal attempts, Boswell ranked second in field goal percentage.\n\nBoswell was the only kicker in 2019 that did not miss an extra-point attempt (28 of 28) and connected on at least 90% of his field goal attempts. He was the first NFL kicker to accomplish the feat since 2017 and fifth to do so since 2015, when the extra-point attempt was moved to the 15-yard line.\n\nWide receiver and punt returner Diontae Johnson excelled under Smith's tutelage in 2019. The rookie led the NFL in punt-return average (12.4). Johnson was the fifth player in franchise history to lead the League and first since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. He returned a punt 85 yards for a TD at Arizona in Week 14, which was the longest punt return for a TD in franchise history. It was the first punt-return TD for the Steelers since December 6, 2015 (Antonio Brown vs. Indianapolis). Johnson was the first Pittsburgh rookie with a punt return for a TD since December 17, 2006 (Santonio Holmes vs. Carolina).\n\nBoswell landed 13 successful field goals in 2018, following a 2017 season where he earned his first Pro Bowl selection after a record-setting campaign. Boswell established single-season franchise records for the most field goals made (35) and total points (142) during the 2017 season, in addition to setting a team record for the most field goals made from 50 yards or further in a season with four. His 35 field goals made and 142 points surpassed the previous milestones of Norm Johnson set in 1995 (34 and 141). Boswell converted four game-winning field goal attempts \u2014 kicks within one minute of regulation \u2014 during the 2017 regular season.\n\nIn 2016, Boswell tied the franchise's regular-season record for the most field goals made in a single game with 6 (12/18 at Cincinnati). Also in that contest, he set the franchise record for most field goals made from 40 yards or longer in a single game (5). Since 1960, his 5 made field goals from 40 yards or longer are tied for the most in a single game in NFL history (Mason Crosby, 11/22/15).\n\nBoswell also set the NFL and Steelers record for most field goals made in a single postseason game (6) at Kansas City in the AFC Divisional Playoff. At the end of the 2016 postseason, Boswell was a perfect 15-of-15 in his playoff career. He became the first player in NFL postseason history to covert each of his first 15 field goal attempts.\n\nThough Boswell had never kicked in an NFL game prior to his 2015 Steelers debut, he made 29 field goals and 26 PATs for a total of 113 points in just 12 games. He set rookie/first-year single-season team records in field goals made (29), points (113) and field goal percentage (90.6). Boswell's 29 made field goals tied for fifth on the team's single-season field goals made chart.\n\nPrior to the 2015 regular season, the Steelers lost kicker Shaun Suisham for the season in the team's first preseason contest due to a knee injury. Pittsburgh then went through two other kickers (Garrett Hartley and Josh Scobee) before signing Boswell prior to the team's Week 5 game.\n\nThrough his first five years in the NFL and with the Steelers, punter Jordan Berry owns the team's single-season regular season record for highest net punting average (40.9, 2019). He ranks third in franchise history with a 44.2 punting average (min. 100 punts) and second in team annals with 131 punts inside the opponent 20-yard line.\n\nBerry, who recorded a franchise record 40.9 net punting average, averaged a career-best 45.5 yards per punt in 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Berry tallied a 38.8 net punting average coming off a 2017 season in which he posted the second-best mark in team history with a 39.8 average.\n\nIn 2016, Berry set the team's single regular-season record for highest net punting average (40.2) and became the seventh Steeler in team history to land 50 punts inside the opponent's 20-yard line in their career.\n\nDuring the 2015 season, Berry established a Steelers' single-season record (since 1976) for the highest percentage of punts downed inside the 20-yard line (47.5). That percentage also placed him third in the NFL.\n\nIn 2014, Smith got solid efforts from Suisham and punter Brad Wing. Suisham made 29-of-32 field goal attempts and all 45 of his PATs for a total of 132 points, good for fourth in the AFC. Wing averaged 43.7 yards per punt in his debut NFL season in 2014. His gross punting average was the fifth-highest total in team history for a rookie or first-year player in a single season.\n\nIn the Steelers' Week 17 showdown with the Cincinnati Bengals, the AFC North Championship was on the line. Smith's punt return units cleared the way for Antonio Brown to return a punt 71 yards for a TD. It marked the second straight season Brown returned a punt for a TD against Cincinnati.\n\nIn Smith's first season as the Steelers' special teams coordinator in 2013, Suisham had a career year, connecting on 30-of-32 field goals, which are a career high and are tied for the third-most field goals made in a single season in Steelers history. His 93.8 field goal percentage (minimum 15 attempts) also set a new single-season team record.\n\nIn addition to being selected to the Pro Bowl as a wide receiver in 2013, Brown was also selected as a return specialist. He recorded a 67-yard punt return for a TD in Week 15 versus Cincinnati, which was one of his five returns of 40 or more yards on the season.\n\nPrior to joining Pittsburgh, Smith served as the Washington Football Team's special teams coordinator from 2004-2012. He helped establish Washington's special teams as one of the top coverage and return units in the NFL.\n\nPrior to joining the Washington Football Team, Smith was the special teams coordinator for the Buffalo Bills (2001-03), coached tight ends for the Detroit Lions (1999-2000), and he split duties as the defensive backs and special teams coach for the Philadelphia Eagles (1995-98).\n\nSmith spent eight years (1987-94) as an assistant coach for Georgia Tech, where he coached running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. He was on the staff for the Yellow Jackets' 1990 team that was named co-NCAA National Champions.\n\nSmith played defensive back for Edinboro State College from 1972-1976, and he was elected to the Edinboro University Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nHis first collegiate coaching position came as a graduate assistant at his alma mater in 1976. Smith also was a defensive graduate assistant coach at Clemson University (1979), The College of William & Mary (1980-83) and The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina (1984-86)."}, {"url": "https://pro-football-history.com/franchise/40/washington-commanders-coaches", "page_content": "Washington Commanders History\n\nThe Washington Commanders are in their ninetieth season, playing their home games at FedExField, in Washington D.C. since 1997.

Pro Day visits for Steelers\u2019 coordinators and positional coaches have been relatively quiet this season. But we found at least one stop Smith has made this year, appearing at Wake Forest\u2019s Pro Day Wednesday.\n\nHello, Danny Smith at Wake Forest's Pro Day yesterday. Kicker Nick Sciba is draft-eligible. 23/25 last year and didn't miss an extra point. DB Ja'Sir Taylor had a KR touchdown last year too. https://t.co/35RZQ7FHBn pic.twitter.com/A9YrW24QI6 \u2014 Alex Kozora (@Alex_Kozora) March 31, 2022\n\nHe was joined by Dan Rooney Jr., who we noted in our Pro Day tracker yesterday. As my tweet indicates, the Demon Deacons have one true specialist eligible for this year\u2019s draft in kicker Nick Sciba. He\u2019s coming off an impressive 2021 season, connecting on 23 of his 25 field goals and nailing all 65 of his extra points. An extremely accurate kicker, Sciba never missed an extra point in his career and hit 89.9% of his career field goals, 80/89. Sciba set the NCAA record for most consecutive made field goals, at one point making 34 straight.\n\nA photo from the Winston-Salem Journal\u2019s gallery of the Pro Day shows Smith putting Sciba through his workout.\n\nHis most memorable moment though came as a freshman when he forgot (or wasn\u2019t sent) onto the field with the rest of the field goal unit. Sciba rushed onto the field and missed his 37-yard attempt. Luckily, things got a lot better since then.\n\nClearly, the Steelers don\u2019t have a need for a kicker. Chris Boswell is one of the best, and most underrated, in football. But Pittsburgh is at least taking a look at a guy like Sciba as a potential camp add. The team usually has two kickers on its offseason roster. Currently, the other kicker on the roster is Sam Sloman.\n\nBut Sciba might not have been the only player Smith was watching. DB Ja\u2019Sir Taylor had a kickoff returned for a touchdown last season in the team\u2019s opening win against Old Dominion, an impressive tackle-breaking 99-yard run-back. For some reason, he had just six kick returns the rest of the season, and none after October 9th. Taylor is viewed as a UDFA candidate."}, {"url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/football-insider/wp/2013/01/28/redskins-danny-smith-to-interview-for-steelers-special-teams-coaching-job/", "page_content": "Gift Article Share\n\nThe Redskins have granted permission for their special teams coordinator, Danny Smith, to interview for the same job with the Pittsburgh Steelers, a person familiar with the situation said Monday.

Smith, who has coached Washington\u2019s special teams since 2004, received permission to interview with the Steelers earlier this week. He has long been pursued by opposing teams, but the Redskins have always worked to keep him on staff.\n\nThe Steelers asked to interview Smith in 2010, but were denied. But the Redskins allowed Smith to interview with his hometown team this offseason. Smith still has family in the Pittsburgh area.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the best coaches, from a technician standpoint. Very detailed and just a great motivator. He brought a passion and fire that really spread throughout the building,\u201d special teams captain Lorenzo Alexander said. \u201dGuys loved playing for him and not just because of the football aspects, but because you could really tell he cared about you off the field too.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe made it an honor to play special teams,\u201d Alexander added. \u201cA lot of places, it\u2019s like you\u2019re not good enough to play offense or defense so they throw you on special teams and let\u2019s see what happens. But Danny approached it with the mindset that special teams can help decide the outcome of games if guys really took pride in it. He will definitely be missed.\u201d\n\nSmith came under scrutiny early this season when Washington had two punts blocked. But his unit improved as the season progressed and finished in solid statistical standing.\n\nWashington ranked 16th in the league on kickoff returns this season, with a 23.5-yard average, and 17th on punt returns (9.3 ypr). The kickoff return average marked an improvement on last year\u2019s 22.1-yard-per-return average. The Redskins averaged 8.9 yards per punt return in 2011. They ranked 12th in the league on kickoff coverage with an average of 23.0 yards allowed per kick return. On punt coverage, Washington allowed 8.2 yards per return, eighth in the NFL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe kicking game solidified when the Redskins signed Kai Forbath to replace Billy Cundiff six weeks into the season. Forbath went 17-for-18 on field goals, and by making the first 17 attempts of his career, set an NFL record for first-year kickers.\n\nEarlier this offseason the Redskins lost receivers coach Ike Hilliard to the Buffalo Bills. He and Smith are the only coaches to depart so far\n\nIn 2010, Washington hired Richard Hightower to serve as Smith\u2019s assistant.

The team addressed needs early \u2014 Kentucky linebacker Jamin Davis in the first round, Texas offensive tackle Samuel Cosmi in the second \u2014 and transitioned to depth late. The draft was the latest example of Washington\u2019s plan to build a complete, well-rounded team before pushing in all of its chips to find a franchise quarterback.\n\nThe only departure from the blueprint was the decision to trade a 2022 fifth-round pick to Philadelphia for sixth- and seventh-rounders this year.\n\n\u201cIf you let the board do its job, if you believe in the way it\u2019s been set, [if] the highest-graded guy \u2026 is still there, you\u2019re going to get the steal,\u201d Rivera said Friday, reflecting the remodeled front office\u2019s philosophy throughout the draft. \u201cYour grade may not reflect others\u2019. He\u2019s the guy you believe in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRead below for analysis on how each of Washington\u2019s newest additions fits.\n\nFirst round: LB Jamin Davis, Kentucky (19th overall)\n\nRivera said Davis, 6-foot-3, 234-pounds, was the team\u2019s top-rated defender available when it came on the clock in the first round. Washington selected Davis over linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, free safety Trevon Moehrig and left tackle Christian Darrisaw, among other possibilities. The move could shore up the middle of a defense that was susceptible against running backs and tight ends in the passing game last season.\n\n\u201cThe grade matched up with the need,\u201d General Manager Martin Mayhew added. \u201cHe checks a whole bunch of boxes for us.\u201d\n\nJamin Davis finds out he is being picked\n\n\n\nI love these videos pic.twitter.com/JiRXZeeOoa \u2014 Matt Jones (@KySportsRadio) April 30, 2021\n\nRivera said after the pick that Davis is capable of playing any of Washington\u2019s three linebacker positions, something that fit with his comments in a pre-draft news conference of wanting to build a versatile linebacker corps. Davis will play alongside Cole Holcomb, who is able to play either of the outside linebacker spots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNFL Network analyst Daniel Jeremiah said in early March that Davis reminded him of the Indianapolis Colts\u2019 Darius Leonard, who is one of the best young linebackers in the league and succeeds because of his speed and length.\n\n\u201cOverall, Davis lacks some strength to bang versus blockers,\u201d Jeremiah wrote, \u201cbut his speed and playmaking ability jump off the screen.\u201d\n\nSecond round: T Samuel Cosmi, Texas (51st overall)\n\nCosmi was seen as one of the most athletic linemen available in the draft. During his pro day, the 6-6, 314-pound tackle ran a 4.85-second 40-yard dash. He played right and left tackle for the Longhorns, and the position flexibility not only fits Rivera\u2019s vision for his entire team, but gives offensive line coach John Matsko versatility in constructing his unit.\n\nSeveral draft analysts said Cosmi could become an immediate starter. In Washington, Morgan Moses probably has the right tackle spot locked down, so Cosmi could compete at left tackle with last year\u2019s stopgap, Cornelius Lucas; 2020 fourth-round pick Saahdiq Charles; and last year\u2019s opening day starter, Geron Christian, who suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe has good athletic ability, body control \u2026 [and can] recover from compromising positions,\u201d offensive line expert Brandon Thorn wrote of Cosmi on Twitter. \u201cHe needs to revamp and refine his footwork in pass protection \u2026 but he has the work ethic and physical tools to become an above average starter.\u201d\n\nWashington selects another athletic freak in Sam Cosmi\n\n\n\nHis workout metrics from the PFF Draft guide pic.twitter.com/SJaWJc5zYx \u2014 PFF Washington (@PFF_Washington) May 1, 2021\n\nThird round: CB Benjamin St-Juste, Minnesota (72nd overall)\n\nSt-Juste is a big, versatile defensive back who played cornerback at Minnesota and shifted to safety at the Senior Bowl to show teams he could play the position. He has the size (6-3, 202 pounds) and enough speed (4.58-second 40-yard dash) to fit wherever Washington would like him, just like seventh-round pick Kam Curl last year.\n\nRivera said St-Juste has the skill set to play free safety, but that he would wait to see the 23-year-old on the field before choosing his role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI can do whatever,\u201d St-Juste said Friday night, listing his positions as safety, cornerback and nickel cornerback. \u201cI think that\u2019s why they picked me.\u201d\n\nSt-Juste\u2019s journey to Washington was not an easy one. In 2018, Michigan announced the seldom-used reserve had medically retired. St-Juste disputed the announcement, saying the school used it as an excuse to get rid of him and gain an extra scholarship. He transferred to Minnesota and emerged as a consistent starter, tying for a team-high 10 pass breakups in 2019.\n\nWFT gets help in the secondary \ud83d\udd12\n\n\n\nThe Football Team select Gophers DB Benjamin St-Juste with the No. 74 pick in the #NFLDraft pic.twitter.com/0AcdKc23Pu \u2014 B/R Gridiron (@brgridiron) May 1, 2021\n\nThird round: WR Dyami Brown, North Carolina (82nd overall)\n\nBrown is a 6-1, 189-pound wide receiver with blazing speed and big-play ability, a skill set Jeremiah compared to current Washington star Terry McLaurin. In college, Brown posted two straight seasons of averaging more than 20 yards per catch, a skill set that could allow him to emerge as another vertical threat in coordinator Scott Turner\u2019s Air Coryell-based offense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown does not lack for confidence. In his introductory news conference, he said Washington\u2019s speed at skill positions with McLaurin (4.35-second 40-yard dash), Curtis Samuel (4.31), Antonio Gibson (4.39) and himself (4.44) could \u201ccompete\u201d with if not \u201cbe better\u201d than the elite Kansas City Chiefs offense led by Tyreek Hill.\n\nIn college, Brown mostly played the outside, X receiver position and stretched the field. But he said he\u2019s a more complete wide receiver and looked forward to showing it in Washington, whether in the slot or outside. His addition crowds a wide receivers room that, one year after struggling to have enough players to complete practice drills, should have a legitimate competition for the six or seven roster spots. The roster now includes McLaurin, Samuel, Brown, Adam Humphries, Antonio Gandy-Golden, Cam Sims, Steven Sims Jr., Isaiah Wright, DeAndre Carter and Kelvin Harmon.\n\nFourth round: TE John Bates, Boise State (124th overall)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis pick was a bit of a surprise, given that higher-rated tight end prospects were available. But it continued the trend of Washington targeting unheralded prospects at the position, such as Logan Thomas and Sammis Reyes.\n\nBates, who is 6-6 and 256 pounds, could become the primary complement to Thomas, who emerged as a productive starter last season. The team\u2019s depth chart at the position is thin; Reyes has never played a snap of competitive football; Temarrick Hemingway is returning from injured reserve; Marcus Baugh bounced between the active roster and practice squad last season. The team also has Dylan Cantrell and Tyrone Swoopes on reserve/futures deals.\n\nTE John Bates from @BroncoSportsFB is one of my favorites/sleepers.

He fits the team\u2019s mold for defensive backs with versatility and speed (4.41-second 40-yard dash), and he could be an immediate contributor on special teams. NFL.com compared him to Indianapolis reserve safety George Odum, a first team all-pro last season who led the league in special teams tackles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForrest said he can play either safety position but that he\u2019s more experienced at strong. The team lacks an obvious starter at free safety after Troy Apke was benched twice last season and Jeremy Reaves played fine as his replacement in three games. The team has three strong safeties in Curl, coming off a standout rookie season; highly paid veteran Landon Collins; and special teams ace Deshazor Everett. Collins and Everett are returning from season-ending injuries.\n\nDarrick Forrest is a damn good safety prospect...

Cheeseman was the top choice used after Washington traded a 2022 fifth-round pick to Philadelphia in exchange for sixth- and seventh-rounders this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeventh round: DE William Bradley-King, Baylor (240th overall)\n\nThe 6-foot-3, 252-pound edge rusher is undersized as a base end, and on the draft broadcast, ESPN called him a linebacker. He seems to be a tweener, about the same size as recently departed linebacker Ryan Anderson, who was lost in the transition from the 3-4 defense to the 4-3 last season.\n\nBradley-King could offer Washington depth on the edges behind Chase Young, Montez Sweat, Casey Toohill, James Smith-Williams and others.\n\nArkansas State DE William Bradley-King takes setting the edge to a whole nother level.@Willgotthesack decleats his blocker right into the ball carrier's legs, gives great effort on the pursuit & gets in on the tackle at the end.

He\u2019s 6-2 and 242 pounds and ran a 4.52-second 40-yard dash at his pro day last month. Scouting reports describe him as athletic and instinctive against the run, but his size and strength could limit his potential as an every-down player in the NFL. He could bring value on special teams, and defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio could capitalize on his traits to deploy him as a situational blitzer.\n\nShaka Toney turning the corner - my goodness pic.twitter.com/vueKa3axWk \u2014 Connor Rogers (@ConnorJRogers) October 24, 2020\n\nSeventh round: WR Dax Milne, Brigham Young (258th overall)\n\nThe top Cougars wide receiver for No. 2 pick Zach Wilson posted six games of more than 100 yards during an impressive junior season. Scouting reports project him as a slot receiver in the NFL, with more quickness than vertical speed, and some questioned whether he was strong enough to consistently bring down contested catches. In Washington, he could compete with Humphries and Sims Jr. for a role in the slot, as well as with other wide receivers for a chance on special teams.\n\nWashington takes Dax Milne\ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\nThe WR catching all of the Zach Wilson TD passes last season\n\n\n\npic.twitter.com/9XRrvgEuUt \u2014 PFF Draft (@PFF_College) May 1, 2021\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsmoney.com/net-worth/danny-smith/", "page_content": "Danny Smith\u2018s source of wealth comes from being a football coach.
