This brief summarizes that story and draws out the relevant lessons from Israel\u2019s experience for the U.S. Army and the joint force.\n\nFor more than a decade, Israel has clashed with Hamas in Gaza, with cycles of violence defined by periods of intense fighting followed by relative lulls. This brief summarizes a report focusing on a five-year period of this conflict \u2014 from the end of Operation Cast Lead in 2009 to the end of Operation Protective Edge in 2014.\n\nThe report tells many stories and holds many lessons. It analyzes the changing face of urban warfare and how an advanced military fought a weaker, yet highly adaptive, irregular force. It also provides a case study of military innovation \u2014 showing how the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) evolved operationally, organizationally, and technologically to meet ongoing hybrid challenges.\n\nMost broadly, though, this is a story of deterrence. Israel never strived for a decisive victory in Gaza. While it could militarily defeat Hamas, Israel could not overthrow Hamas without risking the possibility that a more radical organization would govern Gaza. Nor did Israel want to be responsible for governing Gaza in a postconflict power vacuum. As such, Israel\u2019s grand strategy became \"mowing the grass\" \u2014 accepting its inability to permanently solve the problem and instead repeatedly targeting leadership of Palestinian militant organizations to keep violence manageable.\n\nDealing with Hamas in Gaza puts Israel in a strategic quandary: It needs to exert enough force to deter Hamas from attacking but not so much that it topples the regime.\n\nDealing with Hamas in Gaza puts Israel in a strategic quandary: It needs to exert enough force to deter Hamas from attacking but not so much that it topples the regime. As one Israeli defense analyst put it, \"We want to break their bones without putting them in the hospital.\"\n\nWhile this story is about one country, Israel, dealing with one foe, it has broader applicability\u2014the IDF\u2019s experiences in Gaza offer valuable lessons about using different types of military technology and operational concepts, conducting urban combat under intense legal and public scrutiny, and deterring nonstate actors.\n\nAerial View of the Gaza Strip Israeli-developed area (civilian) beyond the 1950 Armistice Line\n\nIsraeli-developed area (civilian) beyond the 1950 Armistice Line Oslo-defined Israeli settlement zone\n\nOslo-defined Israeli settlement zone Oslo-defined Yellow Area (Israeli security control, Palestinian civil control)\n\nOslo-defined Yellow Area (Israeli security control, Palestinian civil control) Oslo-defined military installation area\n\nOslo-defined military installation area UNRWA refugee camp\n\nUNRWA refugee camp Palestinian-populated area\n\nGaza \u2014 Some Context\n\nFollowing the Six-Day War in 1967 \u2014 when Israel captured Gaza and placed it under military administration \u2014 Israel has engaged in an ongoing struggle with Palestinians as it developed settlements there. Over time, that struggle led to the First Intifada \u2014 a Palestinian uprising over Israeli occupation that lasted from 1987 to 1993 \u2014 and the emergence of Hamas, the militant Islamist group that governs Gaza today. Hamas grew in power as leftist secular groups, such as Fatah and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO), lost influence.\n\nThe 1993 Oslo Accords ended the First Intifada \u2014 creating the Palestinian Authority (PA) as the governing body of the Palestinian people and stipulating that the PLO would recognize Israel\u2019s right to exist. Ultimately, frustration over delays in implementing the Oslo Accords and tensions over Israel\u2019s continued grip on the Palestinians boiled over, sparking the Second Intifada in fall 2000 \u2014 a period of intensified Israeli-Palestinian violence. It led Israel to fortify its border with Gaza and in 2005 to withdraw from the territory completely after nearly 40 years of occupation.\n\nIn a struggle between Hamas and Fatah, Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, slowly becoming a hybrid actor \u2014 part terrorist organization and part pseudo-state \u2014 in the process. This is an evolution that continues to play out. Hostilities between Hamas and Israel led to the First Gaza War and to Operation Cast Lead in December 2008 \u2014 a war that ended quickly with Israeli victory and withdrawal in late January 2009.\n\nTimeline of Conflict in Gaza\n\nOperation Pillar of Defense\n\nFor 20 months after Operation Cast Lead, tensions between Israel and Hamas continued to escalate. Between November 11 and 13, 2012, more than 200 rockets and a number of mortar rounds were fired into Israel from Gaza, wounding dozens of civilians and damaging property. Finally, on November 14, Israel launched Operation Pillar of Defense, with the targeted killing of Hamas military chief Ahmed Jabari and pinpoint attacks against other targets.\n\nOver the eight-day conflict, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) fired more than 1,456 rockets into Israel, hitting Tel Aviv for the first time since Iraqi Scud attacks during the 1991 Gulf War. In response, the Israeli Air Force struck more than 1,500 targets in Gaza, including rocket launchers, weapon stocks, and Hamas government infrastructure.\n\nIsrael mobilized 57,000 reservists and deployed ground forces along Gaza\u2019s border, but the ground incursion never occurred. On November 21, 2012, a cease-fire \u2014 brokered by Mohamed Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood\u2013led Egyptian government \u2014 went into effect.\n\nTimeline For Operation Pillar of Defense\n\nOperation Protective Edge\n\nFor a while, Israel and Gaza enjoyed a period of relative calm. But by 2014, Hamas faced strong economic and political pressure. Egypt\u2019s new president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, viewed Hamas as allied with his archnemesis, the Muslim Brotherhood, and closed down smuggling tunnels from Egypt to Gaza, denying Hamas one of its key revenue sources. Ultimately, this mixture of political and economic pressures sparked increasing levels of violence.\n\nThis violence, in turn, led to Operation Protective Edge, which began on July 8, 2014, and consisted of three phases. The first was an air campaign (July 8\u201316) that looked similar to Pillar of Defense, with Israel targeting Hamas militants and infrastructure.\n\nHowever, the air campaign alone could not destroy Hamas\u2019s tunnel network; so, in a second phase, Israel launched a ground incursion (July 17\u2013August 4). Although IDF forces pushed only a few kilometers into Gaza to find and destroy Hamas\u2019s extensive cross-border tunnels, the IDF sporadically encountered fierce pockets of resistance in such places as Shuja\u2019iya, where the IDF Golani Brigade fought one of the most intense battles of the war.\n\nAfter two weeks of operations, the IDF withdrew, and Protective Edge entered its final \u201cfinishing\u201d phase (August 5\u201326) that was marked by a series of temporary cease-fires broken by air strikes and rocket fire.\n\nAftermath\n\nDamage Assessment in Gaza\n\nProtective Edge took a toll in both blood and treasure. On the Israeli side, at least 66 soldiers and six civilians died in the conflict. According to the Israeli Tax Authority, Protective Edge caused almost $55 million in direct damage to private and public infrastructure and another $443 million in indirect damage given economic disruptions caused by the conflict.\n\nOn the Palestinian side, the United Nations (UN) estimated the number of Palestinian deaths at 2,133, of whom 1,489 were civilians \u2014 a point that Hamas used to advance its legal and international claim that Israel used disproportionate force. By contrast, Israeli estimates suggest that there were 1,598 Palestinian fatalities in Protective Edge, of which 75 percent were combatants. In addition, the UN estimated 500,000 people \u2014 28 percent of Gaza\u2019s population \u2014 were internally displaced, while the homes of some 108,000 people were uninhabitable.\n\nIsrael tries to maintain a difficult balance with respect to Hamas. On one hand, it wants to punish Hamas for its attacks; on the other hand, it does not want to eliminate Hamas because it worries that the organization could be replaced by one that is much more violent.\n\nIn the three years after Protective Edge, Hamas has maintained its control in Gaza and does not appear in danger of being replaced in the near term. And yet, the underlying political and economic pressures on Hamas remain today. Thus, many believe a fourth major Gaza conflict is only a matter of time.\n\nStrategic Lessons\n\nIsrael has been a source of vicarious learning for the U.S. military for decades, and these latest Gaza wars are no exception.\n\nIsrael is still inexperienced with [lawfare], and it is against its ethos. Israel thinks when they conduct war, no one should interfere. Israel has a long way to go, but is starting to grow up. An IDF general officer serving on the general staff\n\nConflict hinges on perception of success. The first relevant lesson is that in conflicts like Protective Edge, public support for the conflict often hinges more on perceptions of the campaign\u2019s success than it does on casualties \u2014 a rethinking about sensitivity to casualties. Israel endured 72 casualties, a significant number given its small population of eight million people (and far more than it suffered in Pillar of Defense or Cast Lead), and yet it fought on with public support \u2014 as long as the IDF showed tangible results. Reading the Middle East is difficult. The conflict also underscores how difficult it is to read the Middle East. Even before the operation, Israel failed to understand properly how the economic hardship and internal political pressure exerted on Hamas might push conflict in Gaza. Indeed, if the IDF could misjudge Hamas despite being next-door neighbors, then the U.S. military needs to be even more wary about misunderstanding the region. Modern militaries must confront lawfare. Protective Edge shows how modern democratic militaries must increasingly confront lawfare \u2014 using law as a substitute for traditional military means to achieve a warfighting objective \u2014 when combating irregular forces, especially in urban terrain. Protective Edge featured several controversial battles. These engagements became the subject of intense legal scrutiny and a UN-led inquiry, which called into question the IDF\u2019s use of weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated areas and other tactics.\n\nOperational, Tactical, and Technological Lessons\n\nIron Dome is a blessing because it buys Israel time, but Israel needs an excuse for why they are killing Palestinians in operations. When Iron Dome works so well and so few Israelis die, Israel loses the justification for the operation. Senior Israeli policymaker\n\nPrecision firepower has limitations. The first lesson has to do with the limits of precision firepower, particularly in dense urban terrain. Ultimately, airpower alone failed to deliver the results the IDF needed during Operation Protective Edge. Despite an intense bombardment during the first week of the conflict, airpower could not achieve tactical results the IDF needed, nor could airpower achieve the broader strategic aim of deterring Hamas and restoring a measure of peace to the region. Missile defense has potential. While Iron Dome\u2019s exact effectiveness rates are frequently debated by outside experts, nearly all Israeli experts \u2014 inside the IDF and outside government\u2014believe the system works. If true, Iron Dome likely saved lives and limited property damage \u2014 and even if not, it certainly relieved political pressure on senior Israeli leaders to bring the conflict to a speedy conclusion and allowed for a more deliberate, if slower, operation. There is value in armor and active protective systems. Before Protective Edge, the IDF invested in intelligence and airpower, often at the expense of particularly heavy armor platforms, while after it, the IDF is once again investing in armored vehicles. Active Protective Systems (APS) protected vehicles from rocket-propelled grenades and anti-tank guided munitions and had other indirect benefits on the battlefield, shifting the ways the commanders maneuvered and serving as an intelligence-gathering system. Tunnel warfare needs to continue to develop. Even after the conclusion of Protective Edge, the IDF faced real technological challenges with detecting, fighting in, and ultimately destroying tunnels. While the IDF improved in tunnel warfare during the campaign, it still remains an area of concern.\n\nHigh-Priority Recommendations\n\nEach of the lessons learned has recommendations associated with it, but we focus here on those of more immediate importance for the U.S. Army and the joint force.\n\nUnderstand the Adversary\n\nDuring its wars in Gaza, Hamas morphed from an irregular adversary to a hybrid one with qualities that only state actors possessed previously. Israel had to adjust to this changing adversary, much in the way the United States will need to adjust when it moves away from counterinsurgency. The Army needs to train to engage with hybrid adversaries and state actors (Russia, China, Iran, North Korea) with far greater military capabilities than the Army has faced in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nUnderstand the Limits of Precision Targeting in the Urban Context\n\nWith the world\u2019s population increasingly living in cities, the Army must anticipate operating more often in urban environments. Adversaries will seek to thwart U.S. overhead-sensing and precision-strike advantages by hiding in the city and among large populations, just as Israel\u2019s adversaries did in Gaza. Ultimately, the Army will need to develop equipment \u2014 such as APS \u2014 as well as the tactics, techniques, and procedures to operate effectively in this environment.\n\nDevelop and Field Rocket and Missile Defenses\n\nAnother characteristic of the battlefield in Gaza is the ubiquity of rockets. Missile defense, such as Iron Dome, helped address this problem. The Army and the joint force will face rocket and missile attacks in the future, ranging from limited hybrid adversary capabilities to the sophisticated systems wielded by such states as North Korea. The Army, in particular, needs to develop Service and Joint capabilities to locate rocket and missile launches and bolster its ability to destroy them from a distance. It must also develop defenses to counter them, particularly for fixed sites.\n\nInvest in APS and Armored Vehicles\n\nAPS and armored vehicles proved vital in Israeli operations, and they are critical for the U.S. military as well. The Army is testing several solutions to provide protection to its Abrams tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and Strykers. This effort must proceed as rapidly as possible, even if it only means fielding an interim solution for early deploying units. While materiel solutions are vital, they must be developed within the context of doctrine, organization, training, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities domains.\n\nPrepare for Tunnel Fighting\n\nOperation Protective Edge revealed a dimension of the battlespace that surprised Israel: subterranean operations. Tunnels and other subterranean structures are another way for an adversary to neutralize the intelligence and strike advantages of airpower. Countering tunneling tactics requires ground forces. The Army needs to understand the implications of subterranean operations across the domains of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, and facilities.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThere are obvious differences between the security challenges that the United States and Israel face. Still, the two nations have a long history of learning from each other, particularly in understanding when the nature of conflict is changing. Indeed, the 1973 Yom Kippur War was a key catalyst in the development of AirLand Battle and many of the key weapon systems still in the U.S. Army\u2019s arsenal. Today, the Army and the joint force need to continue to learn from IDF\u2019s challenges and successes \u2014 and use those lessons to identify gaps in their own approaches. In particular, they must communicate those gaps with urgency to policymakers, given the potential these gaps have to upend future strategies against competent, well-armed, hybrid adversaries."}, {"url": "https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/idf-commander-discharged-after-guardian-of-the-walls-investigation-670750", "page_content": "A platoon commander has been discharged from the IDF following an investigation into an incident where a Palestinian was injured from tank fire after approaching the Gaza border fence during Operation Guardian of the Walls\n\nIn the incident, which took place last month towards the end of the fighting, a platoon commander from the Nahal Brigade\u2019s 50th battalion ordered a tank under his command to open fire with a machine gun towards three Palestinian farmers who were near the border fence.\n\nAs a result of the fire, one of the Palestinians was injured.\n\nThe IDF carried out an investigation into the shooting, with the head of the Southern Command Maj.-Gen.

It ranks among the most battle-tested and highly-trained armed forces in the world.\n\n\n\nLogo of the IDF\n\nThe IDF\u2019s security objectives are to defend the existence, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the State of Israel; deter all of Israel\u2019s enemies; and, curb all forms of terrorism which threaten daily life.\n\nMost soldiers in the IDF are Jewish, but the number of Christian recruits has been steadily climbing since 2012, when concentrated efforts to encourage their enlistment began. The number is still only in the hundreds. In 2019, one soldier was appointed a lieutenant-colonel, making him the first Christian to achieve that rank.\n\nIn October 2014, the IDF topped Business Insider Magazine\u2019s list of most powerful militaries in the Middle East, and also the list of the top air force\u2019s in the entire world. A close security relationship with the United States as well as a booming defense industry gave Israel an edge over the other countries on the list. Israel has one of the most well-tested and battle ready armies in the world (they have fought in four major engagements since 2006), and can mobilize quickly due to the relatively compact size of the country. The Israeli air force was ranked first in the entire world due to their space assets, advanced fighter jets, high-tech armed drones, and nuclear weapons. Chris Harmer, a senior naval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War was quoted in the Business Insider article stating that \u201cPilot to pilot, airframe to airframe, the Israeli air force is the best in the world.\u201d\n\nIDF Doctrine\n\nSociety & Service\n\nTerms of Service\n\nForeign Volunteers\n\nIDF Doctrine\n\nTo ensure its success, the IDF\u2019s doctrine at the strategic level is defensive, while its tactics are offensive. Given the country\u2019s lack of territorial depth, the IDF must take initiative when deemed necessary and, if attacked, to quickly transfer the battleground to the enemy\u2019s land. Though it has always been outnumbered by its enemies, the IDF maintains a qualitative advantage by deploying advanced weapons systems, many of which are developed and manufactured in Israel for its specific needs. The IDF\u2019s main resource, however, is the high caliber of its soldiers.\n\nIn preparing for defense, the IDF deploys a small standing army (made up of conscripts and career personnel) with early warning capability, and a regular air force and navy. The majority of its forces are reservists, who are called up regularly for training and service and who, in time of war or crisis, are quickly mobilized into their units from all parts of the country.\n\nThe IDF\u2019s three service branches (ground forces, air force and navy) function under a unified command, headed by the chief-of-staff, with the rank of lieutenant-general, who is responsible to the Minister of Defense. The chief-of-staff is appointed by the government, on recommendation of the prime minister and minister of defense, for a three-year term, which is usually extended for an additional year.\n\nExcept when combat duty is involved, men and women soldiers of all ranks serve side by side as technicians, communications and intelligence specialists, combat instructors, cartographers, administrative and ordnance personnel, computer operators, doctors, lawyers and the like. The IDF is responsive to the cultural and social needs of its soldiers, providing recreational and educational activities, as well as personal support services. Recruits with incomplete educational backgrounds are given opportunities to upgrade their level of education, and career officers are encouraged to study at the IDF\u2019s expense during their service. The integration of new immigrant soldiers is facilitated through special Hebrew language instruction and other programs. Active in nation-building enterprises since its inception, the IDF also provides remedial and supplementary education to civilian populations and contributes to the absorption of newcomers among the population at large. In times of national crisis or emergency, the IDF responds immediately with appropriate action and assigns trained personnel to fill essential jobs or carry out special tasks.\n\nSociety & Service\n\nService in the Israel Defense Forces is a measure of involvement in the country\u2019s life. Most men and single women are inducted into the IDF at age 18, women for two years and men for three, followed by service in the reserves, men up to age 51 and single women to age 24. The IDF announced in November 2014 that starting in July 2015, male mandatory service in the IDF will be cut by 4 months, with male soldiers now serving a total of 32 months. In addition to this, the mandatory service length for female soldiers is to be extended at the same time, in an effort to promote equality. During the same meeting in which these new service requirements were approved, discussions were also held in reference to raising the salaries of enlisted soldiers.\n\nAs of 2023, 33% of draft-age men do not enlist, half of whom are Haredim, who are granted deferments while pursuing Torah studies (those who do serve mainly fulfill religious functions), which effectively results in their never serving. Out of respect for their community\u2019s religious commitments, Orthodox women may be exempted (45% are), although many choose to perform 1\u00ad2 months of national service in the civilian sector.\n\nWhen the government first decided to allow religious exemptions, it was viewed as a compromise to win Orthodox support for the state. However, over the years, the number granted exemptions has ballooned from a few thousand to tens of thousands. Many Israelis object to the exemptions, which they see as unfair to the majority of people who serve and sacrifice for the country. The debate has been ongoing for years, with the Orthodox religious parties fighting against proposed laws to draft members of their communities. When, for the first time, an Israeli government was formed without any of the religious parties in 2021, there was an expectation that the law would be changed to force the ultraorthodox to bear their share of the security burden. The government fell too quickly; however, and was replaced by a new one with the two major religious parties, which threatened to bring down the coalition if the draft was imposed on them.\n\nIn essence, the society and army are one, as a broad spectrum of the population serves periodically over many years, with those in and out of uniform virtually interchangeable. Since soldiers often hold ranks not necessarily corresponding with their status in civilian life, the IDF has become a highly effective equalizer in society and contributes greatly to integrating individuals from all walks of life. The IDF also helps new immigrants during their period of military service to acclimate to Israeli life in a framework wherein each person is undergoing the same process.\n\nOver the years, the IDF has assumed a variety of national-social functions for the society at large; providing special services for new immigrants; upgrading educational levels of adults who were denied basic education in their countries of origin; supplying teachers to development towns; assisting in disadvantaged areas and responding to emergency situations in the civilian sector.\n\nChristian individuals living in Israel also serve in the IDF and are actively recruited. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke at an IDF Christian Recruitment forum in December 2014 and said that \u201cWe are brothers, we are partners \u2013 Christians and Jews and Druze and Muslims who defend the State of Israel.\u201d\n\nTerms of Service\n\nCompulsory Service: All eligible men and women are drafted at age 18. Men serve for three years, women for 21 months. Deferments may be granted to qualified students at institutions of higher education. New immigrants may be deferred or serve for shorter periods of time, depending on their age and personal status on entering the country.\n\nReserve Duty: Upon completion of compulsory service each soldier is assigned to a reserve unit. Men up age 51 serve 39 days year period time which can be extended in times emergency. Recent policy has been reduce the burden whenever possible and reservists who have served combat UNITS may now discharged at 45.\n\nCareer Military Service: Veterans of compulsory service meeting current IDF needs may sign up as career officers or NCOs. The career service constitutes the command and administrative backbone of the IDF. Graduates of officers\u2019 or pilots\u2019 schools or special military technical schools are required to sign on for periods of career service.\n\nForeign Volunteers\n\nVolunteers have come from around the world to fight for Israel since the War of Independence. Today, the IDF features soldiers from more than 70 countries, with over 1/4 of these recruits coming from the United States. These soldiers are known as lone soldiers, and are placed in the same category as Israeli recruits who do not have a support network (orphans), and Israelis whose parents are not in Israel year-round. The first group of Chinese Jewish IDF recruits, hailing from Kaifeng, China, joined the IDF in 2014.\n\nAccording to the most recent numbers, there are approximately 3,484 active soldiers in the IDF from around the world who have made aliyah.

As a result, before she was conscripted she received a letter from the army saying she would not be drafted because of unsuitability and a medical opinion.\n\nWhen she turned 18 and saw her friends being drafted, Danielle approached the army asking to enlist, and the Israel Defense Forces agreed to draft her as a special trainee on Base 80.\n\nDuring her basic training she approached her commanders and explained that she had a fear of weapons and wouldn\u2019t be able to do weapons training. As a result, the army moved her to a different training program, but there, too, she refused to do weapons training. In February 2011, after being home for a month, Danielle tried a third time to get through basic training, but when she again could not perform on the firing range, she was called to a meeting with the mental health officer, who had asked her father to be present.\n\n\u201cI came to the meeting with the mental health officer on Base 80,\u201d recalls the father. \u201cWe were told explicitly by that officer that a soldier who can\u2019t shoot a weapon can\u2019t be an IDF soldier, and as far as she was concerned she was telling [Danielle] that she was releasing her from the army.\u201d\n\nDanielle accepted the decision, went to the Tel Hashomer base to return her equipment and her military ID card, but did not wait for any document confirming her discharge. \u201cShe was certain they would send her something in the mail. Her mistake was in not waiting for a confirmation there,\u201d said the father.\n\nDuring the ensuing six years, Danielle worked in a company that she opened with her brother and that has since closed. The company was registered in her name, she made National Insurance payments, paid income taxes and VAT, yet at no point did anyone flag her for desertion. In 2016 she was arrested for a minor offense along with a number of friends, and was released without the police saying anything about desertion. She is an amateur photographer and for the past three years has been volunteering with sick children.\n\n\u201cDuring all these years we didn\u2019t hear anything from anyone,\u201d the father said. \u201cWe never got a letter from the army or the police summoning her. There were times when she was stopped for a routine check of her driver\u2019s license and it wasn\u2019t written anywhere that she was a deserter.\u201d\n\nOn March 24, Danielle and four friends were at the airport with plans to fly to Georgia to do some landscape photography. But though her friends got through passport control with no problem, she was stopped and told she was blocked from leaving the country and that the police would have to be called. A short while after she was taken to the police station, military policemen arrived and arrested her for desertion. Within two hours she found herself in Military Prison No. 4.\n\nShe is still there today, awaiting trial. At first the prosecution asked for an 18-month prison term, then came down to 11 months until finally agreeing to ask for eight months.\n\n\u201cThis is a young woman who did not know she was a deserter,\u201d said Danielle\u2019s attorney. \u201cShe arrived at the airport with a round-trip ticket so she had no intention of fleeing the country. We will prove that in those years she had never been approached by the Military Police and no document was sent to her informing her that she was a deserter. This is not a young woman who was living in hiding. She was known to all the authorities as a business owner.\u201d\n\nThe IDF Spokesperson said, \u201cThe accused was recently arrested for being a deserter for six-and-a-half years. The material collected in her case shows that she was conscripted legally and that after she was rejected twice from basic training she deserted from service. In contrast to her claims, she was not given a profile of 21 during her service and she was not discharged from the IDF. Only recently, after her arrest, when she was 26, was she found unfit to serve for medical reasons.\n\n\u201cIn April the military prosecution filed an indictment against her for desertion. Her detention was periodically extended in view of the evidence and the grounds for her arrest. [] The defense has asked for mediation and the prosecution has been asked for its position on this.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Eden-Natan-Zada", "page_content": "Eden Natan-Zada (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d3\u05df \u05e0\u05ea\u05df-\u05d6\u05d3\u05d4\u200e\u200e, born 9 July 1986, died 4 August 2005) was an Israeli soldier who opened fire in a bus in Shefa-Amr in northern Israel on 4 August 2005, killing four Israeli-Arabs and wounding twelve others. He was restrained, disarmed and cuffed when he tried to reload to prepare for another round of shooting. After he was restrained and handcuffed, he was beaten to death by the crowd, as recorded on video. It has been inferred that the shooting was a personal protest against the Israeli government's disengagement plan, since an orange ribbon was found attached to Natan-Zada's pocket. (Orange was an emblem color of anti-disengagement activism).\n\nNo group had taken credit for the terror attack and one official in the settler movement denounced it. Natan-Zada was absent without leave and in hiding from the IDF at the time of the shooting. He had recently become religious after getting involved with far-right activists.\n\nEarly life\n\nNatan-Zada was born to an Israeli-Jewish family that had immigrated to Israel from Iran and Yemen. Natan-Zada's parents describe him as having been a \"bright and studious Israeli schoolboy\" prior to his becoming involved with the Jewish extremist Kahanism movement, to which he was introduced via the Internet. He then began spending weekends in Kfar Tapuach, an Orthodox West Bank settlement. During his national service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Natan-Zada deserted the army and hid in Kfar Tapuach to avoid further service. According to Matthew Gutman of the Jerusalem Post, Kfar Tapuach \"became the unofficial headquarters of the Jewish terrorist group Kahane Chai in 1990,\" but supporters deny the existence of a Kahane headquarters.\n\nIn a letter left behind after his desertion, Natan-Zada expressed dismay to his parents over the disengagement plan, saying 'Just as I couldn't carry out an order that desecrates the Sabbath, I cannot be part of an organization that expels Jews.' He added the anti-pullout slogan 'Jews don't expel Jews' to his letter, and concluded the message with the words: 'I will consider how I will continue to serve.'\n\nHis mother claims that prior to the shooting she alerted the IDF and other security services that her son was still in possession of his military-issued weapon. 'We told everyone he's AWOL, that he could do something with his gun. We begged them to take away his gun. He also asked them to take his gun. The army destroyed my child. The army destroyed my life.' According to The New Republic, 'an army psychiatrist warned that he wasn't fit for weapons or uniform, but his professional judgment was awaiting approval by a panel of medical experts that was not very swift in assembling' and that a 'former chief of staff of the IDF' had 'speculated that the killer's parents might have a chance to win damages in court for neglect by the army of the welfare of their son.'\n\nShefa-Amr attack\n\nNatan-Zada boarded the Shefa-'Amr-bound bus on Thursday, 4 August 2005. He was dressed in full IDF uniform, carrying his IDF-issued M16 rifle, and, according to observers, wearing the skullcap, beard, and sidelocks of an observant Jew, as well as an orange ribbon hanging from his pocket. According to witnesses, the bus driver was initially surprised to see a religiously-observant Jewish soldier making his way to Shefa-'Amr (an overwhelmingly Arab city) via public bus, so he asked Natan-Zada if he was certain he wanted to take his current route. Upon arriving in Shefa-'Amr's primary Druze neighborhood, Natan-Zada stood up and approached the front door as if to disembark the bus. When the door opened, Natan-Zada turned around and shot the driver. He then fatally shot a man sitting behind the driver, and fired into the rest of the bus, killing two young women and wounding twenty-one passengers. When he paused to reload his weapon, a passenger grabbed the barrel of his gun, sustaining burn injuries, and he was subdued by streetgoers gathered around the scene of the bus shooting. When the police arrived at the scene he was tied up but still alive, but the small force of police officers on the scene could not prevent the crowd from lynching him, and nine police officers were injured attempting to protect him. It took the police four hours to remove his body from the scene.\n\nThe four victims were Hazar Turki and Dina Turki, two sisters in their early twenties, and two men, Michel Bahus (the driver) and Nader Hayek; all were Arab citizens of Israel. The wounded were rushed to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa. In the days after the attack, 40,000 people attended a funeral service in honor of the victims in the town. The two sisters were buried in an Islamic cemetery, and the two men in the local Christian cemetery.\n\nSuspicion that authorities were aware of Natan-Zada's intentions\n\nIn March 2010, a lawyer representing some of the lynch suspects discovered security forces aerial footage of the scene prior to, during and after Natan-Zada's attack and after the lynching of Natan-Zada and accused the Israeli government of prior knowledge of Natan-Zada's intentions. At the time, the police denied it had aerial support and some have claimed a conspiracy theory that the government was trying to delegitimize the anti-disengagement movement by provoking an extremist act or setting up Natan-Zada.\n\nReactions\n\nThen Prime Minister of Israel Ariel Sharon condemned Natan-Zada's actions unequivocally, calling them \"a reprehensible act by a bloodthirsty Jewish terrorist,\" and \"a deliberate attempt to harm the fabric of relations among all Israeli citizens.\" Vice Premier Shimon Peres and Interior Minister Ophir Pines-Paz visited the bereaved families. \"Your pain is the pain of the entire State of Israel. We will not allow crazy men and terrorists to harm your life here,\" Peres told the families. Sharon's government consistently referred to the shooting as \"an act of terrorism,\" language usually reserved for Palestinian suicide bombers.\n\nWhile the Israeli government and US State Department both consider groups based on Kahanism to be terrorist organizations, Kahanist advocates insist their ideology only advocates the forced removal of Arabs from the Land of Israel, not murder.\n\nInvestigation and trial\n\nThe Israel Police opened a criminal investigation into Zada's lynching.\n\nThe High Follow-Up Committee for Arab Citizens of Israel called on the government to refrain from investigating the death of Eden Natan-Zada. Arab Knesset member Mohammad Barakeh, a Shefa-'Amr resident himself, warned that protests could erupt if police probe Zada's lynching: \"Normally when someone stops a terrorist from continuing to kill he is considered a hero, but in this case it is the heroes who are sitting on the defense stand\". However, Shefa-'Amr's security officer, Jamal Aliam, told Army Radio that Zada had been attacked by dozens of people after he had been handcuffed and subdued by police.\n\nEventually, on 13 June 2006, five suspects in the lynching were arrested, one who was already serving a prison sentence was brought in for questioning, and a seventh suspect turned himself in after learning he was wanted by police. The police said: \"We're responsible for maintaining the law, and you can't take the law into your own hands even when it concerns a terrorist who murdered innocent people, even though he made a heinous terrorist act\". Two suspects were subsequently released. There was general support for their arrest and even left-wing activist Yossi Beilin said: \"Israel can't put up with a lynch made on a handcuffed person even if his actions are heinous and unforgivable. It's a combined interest of both Jews and Arabs that Israel won't close its eyes to such behaviour\". The Arab Knesset members however demanded their release and called their arrest a crime.\n\nOn 7 June 2009, twelve Arab citizens were indicted over the lynching in the Haifa District Court. Seven were charged with attempted murder. In March 2010, Maher Talhami, their defense lawyer, stated that recently discovered aerial footage of the bus, recorded by an Israeli drone before, during and after the attack took place indicates that Israeli defense officials were aware of Natan-Zada's intentions.\n\nIn July 2013, the seven defendants charged with attempted murder were acquitted of that charge, but four were convicted of attempted manslaughter and two were convicted of aggravated battery, while one was exonerated entirely. The sentencing took place on 28 November 2013. Three were sentenced to two years in prison, while one was sentenced to 20 months, one to 18 months, and one to 11 months.\n\nBurial controversy\n\nNatan-Zada's funeral was a controversial matter. Jewish law requires a swift burial, but nationwide outrage against his attacks left his body without a willing resting place for two days.\n\nAn initial agreement between IDF officials and the Natan-Zada family would have allowed burial in a military cemetery, but with no military honors such as a 21-gun salute or placement of the Israeli flag upon his coffin. However, Meir Nitzan, the mayor of Rishon LeZion intervened before the funeral. The morgue which housed Natan-Zada's body, Abu Kabir Forensic Institute, refused to release the body to friends and fellow Kahane activists to bury, resulting in a bitter protest.\n\nResidents of Kfar Tapuach were divided on the issue. Kfar Tapuach resident Moshe Meirsdorf said Natan-Zada's connection to the community \"has been destructive for us. We totally reject everything he did.\" Meirsdorf claimed that Natan-Zada and other extremist youth were not official community members, despite the fact that Natan-Zada had legally updated his address to Kfar Tapuach. \"He was never accepted by the absorption committee,\" said Meirsdorf, whose wife is a member of the committee. Others supported Natan-Zada, including four teenagers from Tapuach who were arrested following the incident. Most locals, however, voiced opinions in line with Tapuach leader David Haivri, who expressed pain over the loss of Natan-Zada and emphasized the tragedy of his death.\n\nSome Israeli media outlets initially suggested that Natan-Zada be buried in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where Baruch Goldstein, who committed Cave of the Patriarchs massacre 11 years earlier, is buried. Natan-Zada's body resided for two days in the Abu-Kabir morgue, pending an appeal to Prime Minister Sharon by his parents. On 7 August 2005, the Prime Minister's Bureau overruled Meir Nitzan's ban against burial in Rishon LeZion, and decreed that Zada should be buried in the civilian cemetery there. He was buried in the Gordon neighborhood. Because of the delays, Natan-Zada was buried two days after Jewish law allows. Three of the hundreds of mourners at the burial were arrested with administrative arrest orders, including \"New Kach\" leader Efraim Hershkovits, American citizen Saadia Herskof, and former Kach activist Tiran Pollack's son Gilad.\n\nVictim compensation\n\nAfter the event, the Israeli Defense Ministry ruled that the four Arab citizens shot dead were not victims of terror because their killer was not part of a terrorist organization, and are thus not entitled to the usual compensation for life lost due to terror attacks. According to Mayan Malkin, a spokeswoman with the Israeli Defense Ministry, an attacker must be a member of the \"enemy forces\" against Israel to be considered a terrorist under the law. Instead, they received payment \"beyond the letter of the law,\" as a lump-sum payment, as opposed to the lifelong monthly annuity given to the families of terror victims. Representatives of the Arab community in Israel condemned the decision, with Mohammed Barakeh, an Arab member of the Israeli parliament, saying that the \"\u2026decision raises a strong scent of racism, which distinguishes between a Jewish terrorist and an Arab terrorist.\" On 19 July 2006, the Israeli government changed the \"Compensation Law for Victims of Hostile Acts\" to include anyone victimized by violence stemming from the Israeli-Arab conflict. As a result of this change, the victims and families of Natan-Zada became eligible for terror compensation."}, {"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/killers-of-jewish-terrorist-get-11-24-months-in-prison/", "page_content": "The Haifa District Court on Thursday handed out jail terms ranging from 11 to 24 months to seven men convicted in the 2005 lynching of Jewish terrorist Eden Natan Zada, an AWOL IDF soldier who was beaten to death by a mob in the northern city of Shfaram after opening fire in a public bus, killing four.\n\nFour of the defendants, found guilty of attempted manslaughter, assaulting a police officer, rioting and interfering with a police investigation, received prison sentences ranging from 20 months to two years.

Israeli authorities do not recognize many Palestinian settlements in the South Hebron Hills region, and regularly demolish construction they say is illegal.\n\nPalestinians counter that Israel rarely issues permits for them to legally build in Area C. Around 200,000 Palestinians live in the zone, where the Oslo Accords grant Israel full civilian and security control \u2014 including over construction. But between 2016 and 2018, according to data released by the Civil Administration to the Bimkom rights group, only 1.4% of Palestinian requests for permits were granted.\n\nAbu Aram\u2019s own house in the unrecognized village of al-Rakeez was demolished in November by Israeli authorities as part of a crackdown on illegal Palestinian construction, according to a report by B\u2019Tselem."}]}
