Kappos was born in 1961 in Palos Verdes, California. He was educated at the University of California, Davis, where he earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical and computer engineering, and the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a Doctorate of Jurisprudence.\n\nKappos spent more than 25 years at IBM. As counsel in the area of global intellectual property (IP) protection, he oversaw the protection of the firm\u2019s IP in the Asia-Pacific region. Then, in 2003, he became IBM\u2019s chief IP lawyer. Attaining the rank of Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, Intellectual Property Law, he managed IBM\u2019s patent and trademark portfolios.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Kappos for the position of Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property and Director of the USPTO. The Senate confirmed Kappos\u2019s appointment on August 13, 2009. As Director, Kappos prioritized the strategic navigation of a severe recession, the implementation of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), and the reduction of pendency intervals (the amount of time between an applicant's submitting an application and receiving a decision).\n\nIn response to financial pressures resulting from the recession (2007-2009) and a decline in business activity for the agency, the USPTO froze hiring and scaled back programs where possible. The outlook brightened in 2011 when Congress passed the AIA, which Director Kappos helped to shape. He then set to work implementing the Act\u2019s provisions, including the establishment of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, and restarting expansions and initiatives that had been interrupted by the recession.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Kappos and the USPTO succeeded in reducing pendency by several months. The number of unexamined utility patent applications shrank, too, as the backlog fell from about 750,000 in 2009 to about 609,000 in 2013. In the same period, the Trademark organization exceeded its targets for action and final pendency. In pursuit of greater efficiency, Director Kappos pushed for the replacement of antiquated information technology, reengineering many of the systems and processes that kept patent and trademark applications moving.\n\nUnder Director Kappos\u2019s leadership, new offices and institutions arrived that proved to be lasting. The USPTO gained a Chief Economist and its first permanent satellite location, the Elijah J. McCoy Midwest Regional Office in Detroit, Michigan.\n\nOther major milestones under Director Kappos\u2019s leadership include the issuance of patent 8 million and the attainment of fifth place for employee satisfaction among the 300-plus federal agency and agency subcomponents surveyed by the Partnership for Public Service in 2012. The USPTO had risen steadily in these rankings from 172nd place in 2009, just before Kappos assumed office, to first place, shortly after his departure.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDavid J. Kappos.

He came to UC Davis with a respectable grade-point average; then, during his first quarter, he scored an A-plus \u2014 well above the rest of the class \u2014 in a chemistry course taught by Professor Dino Tinti (later emeritus).\n\nTinti subsequently wrote the young student a short note of encouragement.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018You could have a future,\u2019 \u201d Kappos recalled, in a 2010 interview. \u201cThat was the first time an academic in a position of authority had said that to me, and it had a big impact.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Kappos earned a bachelor of science in electrical and computer engineering from UC Davis in 1983, then followed that with a law degree from UC Berkeley in 1990. His subsequent career in the intellectual property field led to a stint as vice president and assistant general counsel for intellectual property at IBM, where he managed worldwide intellectual property operations.\n\nIn August 2009, Kappos became the Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual Property, and Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\n\n\u201cI work harder than anybody else,\u201d he confessed, during that 2010 interview. \u201cYou get the best results in any deal not because you\u2019re the smartest or the flashiest, but because you\u2019re the last one standing. I learned that at UC Davis.\u201d\n\nIn April 2010, Kappos visited UC Davis to discuss his view that when transferring technology from the laboratory to the marketplace, universities must champion a new method based on long-term relationships with commercial partners. The idea is to simplify negotiations and quickly introduce inventions into the community: an approach that can generate more funding than if universities rely solely on long-shot \u201cblockbuster\u201d patents to pay off.\n\nKappos also encourages \u201chumanitarian IP\u201d: innovative licensing models that make products available at low cost. One such example is the San Francisco Bay Area\u2019s Gilead Sciences, which has licensed Indian companies to manufacture its anti-human immunodeficiency virus drugs for export to Africa, while charging only a modest royalty payment.\n\nWhen relaxing at home, Kappos\u2019 favorite sport is ice hockey, and he cites Sherlock Holmes as his \u201cfavorite fictional inventor.\u201d He regards Jules Verne as the world\u2019s most significant science fiction visionary, but refuses to choose between Star Trek and Star Wars. (\u201cThey\u2019re both great!\u201d)\n\nIn June 2011, Kappos gave an address to graduates of the UC Davis College of Engineering. No doubt recalling the encouragement he had received, years earlier, he was similarly inspiring to this next generation:\n\n\u201cThe power to innovate is the power to lead,\u201d he said, \u201cby creating, solving and doing.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://citp.princeton.edu/event/patent-success-or-failure-the-america-invents-act-and-beyond/", "page_content": "Much of the criticism of our patent system can be traced to the feeling that the system does not work equally for all stakeholders, and the AIA is no exception to this. This session will offer a comparative look at the AIA across industries, such as software and biotechnology.\n\nThe AIA has the potential to alter the patent landscape significantly. Given the lengthy timeline for fully implementing the AIA, it may be years before we feel the full effects of the legislation. This session will examine the ways in which the AIA has already changed patent law, and look forward to the future effects of the legislation.\n\nThe AIA sets out a protracted timeline for implementing its many provisions, with the last of these provisions taking effect September 16, 2019. This session will focus on major questions of implementation.\n\nAttorneys: This transitional CLE program has been approved in accordance with the requirements of the New York Continuing Legal Education Board for a maximum of five hours professional practice credit.

Norr, an instructor at the University of Minnesota\u2014Duluth's Swenson College of Science and Engineering who has a master's degree in electrical engineering, wrote in an email.\n\nElectrical engineers are inventors, designers and builders who understand how to manipulate currents and voltages in creative ways that advance technology. Like all areas of engineering, this academic discipline is a hands-on field that involves making and improving practical objects.\n\nThe median salary among U.S. electrical and electronics engineers as of May 2020 was $103,390, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which predicts that employment in the occupation will be 7% higher in 2030 than it was in 2020.\n\nWhat Electrical Engineers Do and Why It Matters\n\nBecause electricity is ordinarily invisible to the naked eye, someone who intends to work as an electrical engineer should be curious about mysterious forces that significantly affect the universe but aren't obvious to a layperson. A future electrical engineer should have a powerful imagination and strong abstract thinking abilities.\n\n\"You can't see electrons flowing through a wire in a circuit or electromagnetic waves generated by an antenna,\" Andrea Mitofsky, a professor of electrical engineering at Trine University in Indiana, explained in an email.\n\n\"Electrical engineers rely on mathematics to model these types of physical phenomena, so electrical engineers need strong mathematics skills,\" adds Mitofsky, who has a Ph.D. degree in the field. \"Electrical engineers also need strong computer skills.

Like physics, electrical engineering requires the interpretation and application of complex theories, and it also demands technical abilities.\n\n\"A common trajectory to becoming an electrical engineer is that of a youngster with an analytic mindset who chases their curiosity, who meets challenges, who gets hands-on exposure to electronics projects, who takes one's math and science courses seriously, and then obtains an Electrical Engineering degree in college,\" Kleinrock says.\n\nA bachelor's degree in electrical engineering is the standard entry-level credential within this field, though a master's or Ph.D. degree in this area can improve a job candidate's marketability and allow that person to obtain higher-paying, more interesting positions.\n\nElectrical engineers frequently specialize in a particular type of technology and develop expertise in that area, experts say.\n\n\"Depending on a specific individual's field of practice, one could find themselves designing the latest computer chip, designing electronics systems that must travel across the solar system, designing a new electric vehicle or writing software to control an autonomous robot,\" Donovan Wallace, vice president of electronics at Design 1st product design company, wrote in an email.\n\nSam Brown, an electrical engineer with over 20 years of experience developing wireless systems, says it's important for prospective students to select engineering schools that align with what they care about most.\n\n\"Every school that offers a program in electrical engineering has a certain specialization within the broader area,\" Brown, who blogs about wireless and radio engineering on his website OneSDR.com, wrote in an email. \"For instance some universities might specialize in integrated circuit development.
