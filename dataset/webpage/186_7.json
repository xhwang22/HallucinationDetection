Featuring the evocative vocals of Caroline Lavelle and the masterful guitar work of Brian Hughes, Secret Sky weaves together a tapestry of Pop and World music with exotic textures of the Middle Eastern Oud, Puerto Rican Cuatro, and the hypnotic Greek Lyra played by a contemporary master of the Lyra, Sokratis Sinopoulos. Opium takes the listener on a remarkable musical journey accompanied by an All-Star cast of musicians. Caroline Lavelle and Brian Hughes have performed together for over 20 years when Caroline joined Brian as a member of Loreena McKennitt\u2019s recording and touring ensemble. The idea for Secret Sky was born on a shuttle ride from their hotel to the Sao Paulo airport at the end of a South American tour with Loreena in 2013. After sending numerous songs and recordings back and forth via the internet, Caroline from Cornwall, UK and Brian from Los Angeles the result was their 2016 self-titled debut album Secret Sky. Guitarist, Composer, and Producer Brian Hughes has been honored with the SOCAN / BMI Jazz & Instrumental Composer of the Year award seven times from 1997 to 2011 for his eight contemporary jazz recordings while his 36-year parallel career with Loreena McKennitt led to him receiving a Juno (Canadian Grammy) nomination as Producer of the Year for his work on her platinum-selling album, The Visit. Brian and Caroline\u2019s skills as musicians are in the foreground on Loreena\u2019s 2019 release \"Live at the Royal Albert Hall\" and on her 2012 Grammy-nominated trio recording \u201cTroubadours on the Rhine\u201d. McKennitt has sold over 15 million albums worldwide and Hughes along with Secret Sky bandmate Lavelle continue to appear together on numerous tours and recordings with Loreena. Caroline Lavelle\u2019s first foray as a vocalist was with Massive Attack, which brought her to the attention of William Orbit, who produced her first CD Spirit which garnered critical and popular acclaim. Among others, she has sung and / or played with Radiohead, Peter Gabriel, Vangelis, De Dannan, The Chieftains, Muse and The Indigo Girls. Her two other solo CDs (Brilliant Midnight and A Distant Bell) have produced songs since used on film & TV soundtracks including Six Feet Under, Joyride (John Dahl), The Eye of the Beholder (Ewan McGregor & Ashley Judd).

She has released three solo albums, collaborated with numerous international musicians, and is currently a member of the trio Secret Sky.\n\nHer career as a cello player started by chance: as a child, she\u2019d been desperate to play the violin. On the day instruments were distributed, she was at the back of the queue. As luck would have it, when it was her turn, only a bassoon and a cello were left. Choosing the latter, she went on to study at the prestigious Royal College of Music in London. After graduating, she opted out of the orchestral route, preferring to perform her own compositions. \u201cThe creativity involved in writing one\u2019s own music and having to marry lyrics and arrangements is much more challenging for me. My greatest love is writing.\u201d\n\nCaroline Lavelle in the 1980sIn the early 80\u2019s Caroline recorded with acts such as Siouxie And The Banshees and Fun Boy Three, and busked in London with a group called Humoresque, together with Anne Stephenson and Gini Ball. Frankie Gavin from De Dannan spotted her busking, leading to a stint with the band for several years until the early \u201990s. From this period onwards, Caroline worked with a wide variety of acts (Radiohead, The Cranberries, Peter Gabriel, Nigel Kennedy, Ryuichi Sakamoto, among others), and provided vocals for artists such as Vangelis and Hector Zazou. Her vocal contribution to Massive Attack\u2019s song Home Of The Whale in 1992 led to her work on the soundtrack to the film The Eye Of The Beholder.\n\nIt was Home Of The Whale that also brought her to the attention of William Orbit, who asked her to work on an album. The resulting album (Spirit, 1995) featured a mix of traditional songs and original material written by Caroline, featuring William Orbit\u2019s trademark production. It garnered critical and popular acclaim and The Times reported that it had inspired Madonna\u2019s Ray of Light album.\n\nIn 2001 she released Brilliant Midnight, an album focusing more on Caroline\u2019s skills as a songwriter and producer of her own material, organically blending her own classically inspired instrumentation with electronic arrangements. A year later, Caroline set up her own record label Ringing Tree Records, re-releasing Brilliant Midnight in a revised edition, reflecting the vision she initially had for that album.\n\nA Distant Bell followed in 2004, and was met with positive reviews. The pastoral A Distant Bell could be described as Chamber Folk, and featured original material, traditional songs, and Caroline\u2019s musical settings of Brian Patten\u2019s poetry.\n\nTogether with Justin Elswick and Israel Curtis she has released several tracks for a project entitled Spythriller. A full-length album is in the works. In 2015 Caroline formed the band Secret Sky with Brian Hughes and Hugh Marsh. Having met 20 years earlier in 1995, the three have been playing as a part of Loreena McKennitt\u2019s band ever since. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2016.

In 1992, when Loreena was nominated for a Juno Award as producer on The Visit, Brian was also nominated as co-producer for his work on the album. He also mixed her 2012 Grammy-nominated Troubadours on the Rhine.\n\nThe Visit won a Juno Award for Best Roots & Traditional Album and is the recording that propelled Loreena onto the international stage.\n\nAn accomplished guitarist/composer/producer, Brian has been described as \u201cunclassifiable\u201d and \u201cgenre busting\u201d. He has built a successful career of his own, recording nine jazz albums, most of them released under his own record label Sylvan House Music and available through his website. Over the years, he\u2019s earned a string of accolades, including winning SOCAN\u2019s Jazz and Instrumental Composer of the Year Award seven times. \u201cIt\u2019s really great when you get acknowledged \u2013 it\u2019s a little notch in your belt, but then you move on,\u201d he says.\n\nSo where did it all start?\n\n\u201cI was around 14 or 15 and I was only dabbling in guitar really. I\u2019d be walking home from school having these fantasies about being on stage in Edmonton or Vancouver playing for 20,000 people. I guess it kinda worked out,\u201d he laughs.\n\nBorn in Alberta, Canada, Brian moved to Los Angeles in 2000 to pursue opportunities in the robust jazz community there. Through the decades his music has been influenced by everyone from Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix to Talking Heads and jazz great Wes Montgomery. When he was a teenager, his friend\u2019s sister was into Celtic music and that\u2019s where he heard it first. \u201cWhen I did that 15-minute section of the Toronto concert with Loreena in 1987 as soon as she started playing I knew all the parts would come together, that I could move my jazz and rock sensibility into the music.\u201d\n\nBrian\u2019s main instrument is guitar, but he also plays the oud, bouzouki and the balalaika. He has toured with The Chieftains, produced and mixed international platinum-selling albums for several prominent Greek recording artists, appeared with Loreena on The Late Show with David Letterman, and the title track from his album Shakin\u2019 Not Stirred was featured in an episode of the popular television series Sex and the City.\n\nBrian has also joined creative forces with two other long-standing members of Loreena\u2019s band: cellist/singer Caroline Lavelle and violinist Hugh Marsh in a project dubbed Secret Sky. Four years ago, they released their first CD by the same name. Despite living in three different countries, they were able to stitch together the music remotely thanks to Brian\u2019s production skills, the advancements in home recording technology and as Brian puts it, \u201cwith a lot of back and forthing\u201d. He describes the album as having \u201cthe passionate feel reminiscent of some of the expansive, filmic albums of the \u201870s\u201d. To the layperson, it may seem like a strange way to make a record, but it\u2019s become increasingly common and easier to produce.\n\n\u201cWith Loreena\u2019s albums we had the luxury of all being in the same room. That way, you have the opportunity to pick up on the vibes of other musicians and work off each other,\u201d says Brian. \u201cBut both ways have their benefits.\u201d\n\nNow, with The Visit: The Definitive Edition, Brian is looking back 30 years to the time of the original recording in 1991. Three decades is a long time and he admits his brain is \u201ca bit fuzzy\u201d, but there are some things that are etched in his memory.\n\nHis girlfriend at the time, Pamela (now his wife of 27 years), had an apartment in Toronto back then where her brother\u2019s balalaika hung on the wall. He\u2019d won it as a prize for best costume on a cruise when he was 12 (dressed as a chicken). One day while working on The Visit, Brian took the balalaika off the wall and started playing. When Loreena heard the instrument, she felt it belonged in the musical imagery of \u201cThe Lady of Shalott\u201d, and so it made its way into the recording.\n\n\u201cThey were pretty intense studio sessions and we were at it every day,\u201d recalls Brian. \u201cLoreena\u2019s more of a morning person and I\u2019m more of an evening person, but it all worked out. The sessions were a lot of fun. We were big on textures and ambient sounds and we had these wonderful tribal drum sounds, Middle Eastern percussion and great fiddling.\u201d\n\nLoreena has her own special memories from the time and of working with Brian. \u201cIt\u2019s been great to have Brian\u2019s support all these years, in the studio and on the road. In addition to being able to travel the world while performing, we\u2019ve also had some great times, great meals and some really great laughs. I remember one time when we were recording at Real World Studios and I was auditioning musicians. Out of fun, I put little coloured dots on my forehead and I would add to them as the day went on. Before each of the musicians would come in to play for me, Brian would mention to them that I had this odd fascination with putting dots on my forehead. But he cautioned them to please, whatever they do, don\u2019t say anything when they met me. The musician would politely come into the studio and we\u2019d work with them playing a few tracks, all the while suspecting how whacky they must have thought I was. When the day was over, we had a great laugh over how considerate and respectful everyone had been, though likely privately wondering \u2018what was up with her\u2019!\u201d\n\nBrian too has some funny memories from The Visit. \u201cI can remember Loreena saying to me, \u2018Brian, give me a drag of your cigarette\u2019, then it would go to her head and she\u2019d have to lie down on the sofa for 20 minutes.\u201d\n\nThese days, Brian and his wife Pamela divide their time between L.A. and their hacienda in Mexico. Since the pandemic put the kibosh on live performances of all kinds, they\u2019ve been working on their place in Mexico and \u201cdoing a lot of dog walking\u201d.\n\nAnd of course, he\u2019s dreaming again of performing in front of thousands of people someday soon.\n\nBrian Hughes on Spotify\n\nBrian Hughes Best Of on Spotify\n\nBrian Hughes on AppleMusic\n\nwww.brianhughes.com\n\nSecret Sky on Spotify\n\nSecret Sky on AppleMusic\n\nwww.secretskymusic.com\n\nWritten by Diane Sewell, a career journalist for more than 30 years.

The day of our conversation was earthshaking for him and his wife, Pamela, in a more literal sense. They moved from Canada to the Los Angeles area about five years ago and they experienced their first earthquake that day. They moved from Canada to the Los Angeles area about five years ago they experienced their first earthquake. They were shaken for a few seconds, but had no damage. In the last 15 years Brian has released six CDs, each one a \"must have\" in its own way. All gems, no throwaway cuts or defaults to formula, and each so timeless that it sounds like it was recorded yesterday. During the aftermath of 9/11, Hughes' music was the place I sought solace, not just for the sense of peace, but also for the sense of joy and hope. His music is open and spacious when it comes to mood. You can bring to it what you want and take from it what you need. Along The Way, his latest, is an excellent introduction. He has also been a presence in the brilliantly gifted Celtic/World Music vocalist/songwriter Loreena McKennitt's body of work for almost two decades as guitarist and producer. He is currently writing material for his next CD and beginning work on a new one from McKennitt. Smooth Views (SV): What is it like to be working on two projects that are so different from each other?\n\nBrian Hughes (BH): I find it refreshing. Obviously I love Loreena's stuff. I think it comes from my experience growing up and starting off more in rock. I listened to a lot of Celtic music when I was in my teens but I never really got into playing it. I got into the improvisational aspect of jazz. Then when I first hooked up with Loreena she was doing a lot of traditional pieces that I hadn't played but I was familiar with. I was able to bring a different kind of attitude that came from jazz although I wouldn't say what I play in that context is jazz. I think it's just the mindset of playing something that is outside the idiom.\n\n\n\nSV: There's definitely some cross-pollination. Both your work and hers have a pretty wide range of world music influences. \"Andalusian Nights\" on Straight To You featured the violinist from Loreena's band and carried some of the themes that were on Loreena's The Mask And The Mirror CD.\n\nBH: There was another one on the Under One Sky album called \"Nasca Lines.\" We used to play that live with Loreena and Hugh Marsh, the violinist, got to really take off on that one. So there is cross-fertilization. Even though an album of mine is different from hers what I do on each one is two parts of me. I take on a different role working with Loreena being the voice and the front person. I get to stand back and be the accompanist. With my band I'm the one playing all the melodies, writing the music and being the featured soloist.\n\n\n\nSV: You worked in a record store when you were growing up? And that got you into exploring a lot of different types of music?\n\nBH: When I was in High School. It was great. I was always a big music fan. When I was in school, I used to go to the mall and spend hours going through albums. I managed to land a summer job that turned into a part-time job. It was great because people in each department would tell me stuff to check out. That kind of gave me a fast track to listening to a lot of different things. I had recommendations from people that where already in the know and were older than me.\n\n\n\nSV: Were you already playing guitar?\n\nBH: I was dabbling in it. The family music lessons thing. I got an acoustic guitar and learned a few chords and some Bob Dylan songs and that kind of stuff. One teacher was teaching me jazz but I didn't really know what jazz was, so I had this book with all kinds of jazz chords. I would be playing these things by looking at the chord diagrams and putting my fingers down, and it would make what I thought was a weird sound. I didn't know what it was supposed to sound like so I didn't really get anywhere with that part of it. I just stuck to my three chords. Then at one point I got into picking out a little blues-based lead solo off a record, and the light bulb just turned on. I transposed it all over the guitar, and I was able to play up and down. I could listen to Eric Clapton on a Cream album and figure out the guitar solo. I started going crazy transcribing songs and picking up licks off these various albums. There was a radio station in Edmonton, Canada, where I grew up that was playing a lot of jazz. I heard Grant Green and Wes Montgomery back to back and I was like... wow! I went out and got both the albums. I think the Grant Green one was called Idle Moments, which is still one of my favorites. I tried to figure it out but as it started going through all the changes that jazz often does I didn't quite get it so I found a teacher and started learning more about jazz. Then it made sense because I was listening to jazz so I had something to go after. I was probably about 18. Then I sort of went crazy with it like practicing 18 hours a day and sleeping with the guitar for about five years (laughs).\n\n\n\nSV: How did you go from being heavily influenced by straight-ahead jazz to the more contemporary sound?\n\nBH: I was in a summer music program and really got into playing jazz. I read in a guitar players magazine that Joe Pass had said the best way to get into playing jazz was to just go out and do it. There were all these ensembles at the school and everyone wanted to play fusion stuff. I was thinking I could do that in a rock sort of way so I asked my ensemble teacher if I could put together a trio and get credit for the course. I got a drummer and a bass player and we started practicing between classes and I went out and got us a gig at a local lounge. Knowing just enough songs....\n\n\n\nSV: ...to get through the time it would take for people to drink enough to not know you were repeating them...\n\nBH: It was a pretty ballsy move on my part I suppose. I chose a trio because I didn't want to have a piano or any accompaniment. I wanted to force myself to do all the chords and melodies. I found this club and we went down and played for the manager. He hired us and we ended up playing there for about two years. That's how I learned to play jazz. While I was doing that I started to get into writing more. That's where some of the earlier songs like \"The Lakes\" from Dusk and Dreaming came from. I opened myself up to the other influences and started incorporating world music, pop and everything I liked at the time into my style instead of sticking with just playing standards. I thought my area of expression was in the writing and my style of playing and expressing my emotions that way.\n\n\n\nSV: There were some songs on the first two albums, \"May Dance\" and \"Deux Cafe\" come to mind, that sounded very similar to a certain strain of Pat Metheny Group songs. Was there a PMG influence or was there just a point where your styles converged?\n\nBH: Those early albums were an influence for sure. There are other guitarists I studied more but I liked the music and the vibe. He was certainly an influence but guys like Jim Hall and George Benson were influences too. I guess what came through on Between Dusk and Dreaming was more the sound and style that came from using similar kinds of instruments, acoustic piano and percussion. It all evolves and obviously Pat's albums continue to evolve in whatever direction he chooses and my stuff goes along in my direction. I feel pretty comfortable and happy that I have a sound and people enjoy it and it's me.\n\n\n\nSV: Outside of that, when Between Dusk and Dreaming came out there was nothing else out there that sounded like it. There was a lot of George Benson and Earl Klugh influenced music and the Nouveau Flamenco thing was kicking in, but nothing sounded like this CD. Do you think growing up and developing musically in Canada was a factor?\n\nBH: Growing up where I did, which was a prairie city, cold in the winter and big open sky in the summer, I think that influence comes through, and being distant from the American jazz scene sort of shaped me because it wasn't something I could go out and hear all the time. When I was playing and writing I wasn't really thinking about getting played on the radio. After I got signed and the album came out I went off to do some gigs in Scotland and I got a call that it had gone \"top five\" in the States. I was going \"'top five on what?\" I didn't even know any radio station would play us. It caught me totally off guard. Maybe that's why the music was different. I hadn't heard the format so I wasn't listening to try to create a sound that would fit it.\n\n\n\nSV: Under One Sky followed pretty quickly and continued a lot of the themes of the first one. By then you knew about the music scene in the US and the radio stations, so how did you maintain that originality?\n\nBH: All I have ever done is write what I am hearing and feeling, just trying to express myself. A lot of the writing at that time came out of playing live and thinking the band is going to get bored with these songs, so I better write some more. I would continually write so there would be new material. So it was born out of that as opposed to thinking that the last one went top five and I had to repeat that.\n\n\n\nSV: There was a gap between Under One Sky and Straight to You. What happened?\n\nBH: I decided it would be better to start my own label and record the music then license it to another label. Straight to You came out about eight months earlier in Canada than in the States. Once it was out in Canada I started shopping it in the States and that's when Higher Octave picked it up.\n\n\n\nSV: During that gap \"Casa Magica\" from that CD won the Jazziz magazine \"Guitars on Fire\" competition. How did you end up entering that?\n\nBH: I think Pamela walked in with a copy of the magazine that had the entry form, and we were just finishing mixing that song. The deadline was literally the next day. It was just one of those strange circumstances. We saw the thing and burned a copy, sent it off, and there ya go! It certainly helped having that little bit of notoriety when we were shopping the record in the States.\n\n\n\nSV: Some of the songs, especially the intros, sounded a bit like what was becoming a stylized smooth jazz sound. Was that intentional or just the way things fell together?\n\nBH: I was just doing what appealed to me. I was really unsure about \"Soul Fruit.\" When I wrote it, it had more of a funky shuffle kinda groove, and I felt like as a follow up to Under One Sky it wasn't fitting in. Then the label liked it and wanted it to open the CD.\n\n\n\nSV: It was a big hit for you. Was there any pressure to replicate that?\n\nBH: I don't know. Maybe going into One2One there was the thought that a song might work the same way. I've consciously tried to stay true to myself and write what feels right. Ultimately, I have to go out and play these songs all the time, so if it was a direction I don't feel comfortable with it's not something I'd want to get onstage and play every night. Especially live where we turn them inside out, and every night is different.\n\n\n\nSV: On One2One you decided to not use the electric and acoustic guitars and just go with the Gibson and the hollow body sound because you said at the time you felt like the electric guitar sound was disrupting the continuity of your CDs.\n\nBH: I didn't do my wild rock guitar stuff on Straight to You either, but I did use the nylon string. I thought on One2One I would just focus on one sound because I thought all the variety was confusing people. \"Here Comes Trouble\" (a fusion guitar song with a rap interlude) on Under One Sky kinda freaked people out if they hadn't seen it in our live show, and the record company felt like it broke up the flow. I could kind of see their point, and after that album I haven't really done that again (laughs). I was focusing on one guitar on Shakin' Not Stirred too but the nylon string is back on Along the Way on songs like \"Omaha Unbound\" and \"Endless Road.\"\n\n\n\nSV: Why did you decide to relocate to California?\n\nBH: It felt like I needed a change of scene, and my record company was based here too. There seemed to be more gigs and more opportunities. And it coincided with Pamela and I taking a vacation. Back in 2000 we went to the Caribbean in January. Knowing what it's like in Toronto in January then going somewhere where it is 85 degrees every day we felt like maybe we should think about California. A month later we were down here checking things out, and we moved down for good in July that year. That was the trigger, but it had been on my mind for a while. There is a great pool of musicians that I've managed to hook up with here too.\n\n\n\nSV: And you called Along The Way a travelogue reflecting on this move?\n\nBH: It was reflecting on the move emotionally and physically and the sense of uprooting from somewhere you've been for a long time and shifting coasts and countries. It's a bit of a musical postcard of places and people and things I have experienced in the past touring with my band and touring with Loreena.\n\n\n\nSV: In terms of the postcard theme it seemed to bring back some of the elements of your early work and focus on a wider range of influences than the two previous ones did.\n\nBH: Yeah, its kinda like old friends and reacquainting with things.\n\n\n\nSV: You've always produced your own CDs, and you haven't done any covers or vocals, and the vocalist you do work with is Loreena, who is one of the most distinctive and beautiful voices out there.\n\nBH: Obviously that association has been a great fortune of mine. She's such a wonderful vocalist it makes it difficult to want to go to a different kind of vocal. To go to something vocal just for the sake of having a vocal doesn't make sense to me. I'm not a singer except for a pretty good Neil Young impression, but I don't think I want to go there! To me it would be gratuitous to do a vocal track just to get airplay. With cover tunes I would have to feel like I just had to play that tune and that it would be fun to play. So far it just hasn't resonated with me to do that.\n\n\n\nSV: Do you think that has hurt you as far as record companies or A&R people are concerned?\n\nBH: Probably. I guess that's why I've produced my albums. I felt that if I produced it, at the end of the day if I was happy with it I could say that's good and we're done. That's why I've done that instead of giving the power over to a label or a producer. I'm sure I could work with somebody co-producing or producing in some capacity but it might be more to point out things I might be overlooking as opposed to making hard-line sorts of decisions.\n\n\n\nSV: You have done some work with the guys in 3rd Force though? Your first project with them was Force Field and it was a really different sound for you. That CD was really ambient and groove oriented. Were you in the studio for that? How did it feel doing something so different?\n\nBH: That came from meeting William (Aura) and Craig (Dobbins) when we were on the same label, and they asked me to come in and play. A lot of times there's just kind of a groove, and I pick up the guitar and play with it. I might throw out some ideas, and they do a fair amount of editing on it. I think I played on about seven songs on the new one (Vital Force). They're fun to work with, and that's one of my things. If it's fun, I'll do it. I just try to avoid situations that don't suit the way I play. I've done a few gigs with them now that they are out playing live, and it's been a lot of fun. Eric Darius was on the album, and actually, I am going to be doing a gig with him tonight.\n\n\n\nSV: He's incredible. That will be a fun gig for you and the audience! One of the things about your solo work that takes you by surprise when you're listening over time is there is so much complexity and serious soloing going on but it weaves over the melodies so seamlessly it makes complexity sound accessible.\n\nBH: To me the melody is what keeps the song hanging together. I've never enjoyed music that was more technical than melodic. I mostly write almost like a singer/songwriter. I feel like I have to be able to sing the melody, and it has to have a dynamic to it, hooks and things that repeat and come back so you get that in your head. Then when I go off a tangent and build and shape a solo the listener can still hear the melody, and it doesn't become so abstract. They can hear that thread throughout the solo because it's tied to the melody.\n\n\n\nSV: Do you actually sit down and write or do melodies come to you at odd times or all of the time?\n\nBH: Both. Sometimes if I sit down and start writing and playing an idea will come out right away, or I will noodle around and get some idea that catches on. Other times I might be just sitting around and hear something in my head. Or I might be getting ready to go to bed, or I'll already be in bed and have to find some convenient way to put it down, because no matter how memorable it feels when you are half asleep and it comes to you, it won't be there in the morning if you don't get it down.\n\n\n\nSV: Can you give us a little idea of where you feel like the next CD is going to go?\n\nBH: Well, I'm really into Telecasters right now. I think the next one may be a little bit different from what everyone has come to expect. So we'll see.....
