In MLL offseasons, Striebel played three years of professional soccer from 2002-04 for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers of the USL Second Division.\n\n\u201cHis fitness level was just off the charts,\u201d said former Philadelphia Barrage head coach Tony Resch. \u201cHe could keep going and going. He had great speed. He could shoot it. Unselfish. All the things you look for in a midfielder, he had it.\u201d\n\nWhile Resch and most fans may remember Striebel as a lights-out shooter, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Prior to his senior year at Princeton, Striebel was an X attackman. When freshman Ryan Boyle stepped on campus, Striebel was moved above GLE \u2013 where, Boyle jokes, his shot couldn\u2019t break a paper bag.\n\n\u201cHe completely reinvented himself, starting with his senior year at Princeton moving from behind the cage out in front to midfield,\u201d said Boyle, who also played with Striebel on the Philadelphia Barrage. \u201cHis dedication to his craft is truly remarkable. Going from somebody who didn\u2019t really have much range to speak of at all to being somebody who you had to pick up at 16 yards\u2026 he was unguardable.\u201d\n\nThat work ethic led to a 171-game career. Striebel evolved to earn playing time on the \u201804 Barrage midfield unit featuring Blake Miller (46G, 11A), Roy Colsey (25G, 6T, 7A), Mike Mollot (11G, 8A), and Doug Shanahan (12G, 6A).\n\nStriebel stuck the eventual game-winning goal in the \u201804 MLL Championship for that Barrage squad.

in Major League Lacrosse, veteran Ryan Boyle has officially announced his retirement from the game this morning.\n\n\u201cIt has been a privilege and pleasure to compete in the MLL for the past eleven years. As an aspiring youth player, I never dreamed of having the opportunity to play lacrosse at the professional level. I want to thank all of the people that made that dream a reality, most notably Dave Morrow, Jake Steinfeld, and Commissioner David Gross,\u201d Boyle states.\n\n\u201cOn a personal level I want to thank the Philadelphia Barrage for welcoming me into the league and the Boston Cannons for enabling me to continue my career. Both organizations hold a special place in my heart and I appreciate each team\u2019s unique and professional approach.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I reflect back on my career, I am most proud of the relationships that have been built with incredible people that have a passion for the sport and for life. The sheer number of former teammates, coaches, and staff members that I need to thank is too many to list publicly. Just know that I care about all of you deeply and cherish your friendship.\n\nWith regards to my decision, simply put, it\u2019s time. \u201d\n\nIn his 11 years as a professional lacrosse player, Ryan split his time between the Philadelphia Barrage for 5 seasons before making Boston home for the remaining 6. Ryan won 4 MLL titles over his tenure, 3 championships with Philadelphia (\u201904, \u201906, \u201907) and one with the Cannons on 2011.\n\n\u201cRyan Boyle will be recognized as one of the greatest attackman the game has seen. He\u2019s an unparalleled leader with uncommon toughness and determination,\u201d Cannons Head Coach John Tucker states. \u201cOur personal connection spans more than 20 years. It has afforded me a unique opportunity to watch him grow and develop. I can say that he forged his own path and worked extremely hard for everything he achieved in the game of lacrosse. A brilliant tactician \u2013 fearless leader \u2013 but most of all, a winner. It has been a true honor for me to be a small part of his extraordinary career.\u201d\n\nTony Resch, Head Coach of the Philadelphia Barrage from 2005-2008 had the pleasure of coaching Boyle at the start of his MLL career, \u201cAs a player, Ryan was the perfect combination of talent, intellect, and grit. His desire to win was palpable, and like great players often do, he had a knack for making big plays when it mattered most,\u201d Resch said. \u201cIt was truly a pleasure to work with Ryan, on and off the field.\u201d\n\nAside from his impressive team titles, Boyle was a stand out by his own right, garnering up many individual accolades. In 2004, he was named the MLL Rookie of the year in his inaugural season. Additionally, he was a 5-time MLL All-Star, and 3-time U.S. Men\u2019s National Team player (\u201902, \u201906, \u201910 World Games) winning 2 World Game Gold medals in 2002 and 2010.\n\nBoyle had much success at the collegiate level as well, winning the NCAA National Championship with Princeton in 2001. Ryan was a 4-time All-American as a Tiger, and was a 2-time Ivy League Player of the Year.\n\nMatt Striebel, a former teammate of Boyles at Princeton, the Philadelphia Barrage and the Boston Cannons at the end of 2014 season is certainly no stranger to the type of player Ryan was on and off the field.\n\n\u201cRyan is known for his intelligence and skill. The thing that I\u2019ve always most respected about him is his toughness. He\u2019s fearless, has taken a pounding throughout his career and always gets up,\u201d Striebel went on the say. \u201cPeople talk about certain athletes making their teammates and all the other players around them better\u2013no one in lacrosse exemplifies that more than Ryan. He\u2019s on a very shortlist of people who have impacted my career on this profound a level.\u201d\n\nIn his 6 seasons with the Cannons Boyle finishes:\n\n-Tied for 7th on the Cannons all-time list in games played with 70 as a Cannon\n\n-Tied for 10th on the Cannons all-time list in goals scored with 68 as a Cannon\n\n-2nd on the Cannons all-time list in assists with 140 as a Cannon\n\n-4th on the Cannons all-time list in points with 208 as a Cannon\n\nBill Daye, Boyle\u2019s head coach 2009-2011 at Boston, remembers Boyle\u2019s play in the most profound way.\n\n\u201cIt was a pleasure coaching Ryan during my time with the Cannons,\u201d Coach Daye stated. \u201cMost of the lacrosse world will remember him as a great player and while that\u2019s true, what will stick with me the most is the passion he brought to the field every time he stepped on it and the leadership he brought as well.\u201d\n\nRyan is the only player in MLL history to have 25+ points in 11 consecutive seasons. In 2012, he garnered a career high 39 assists.\n\nIn his 11 seasons with MLL, Boyle finishes:\n\n-1st in MLL History with 272 career assists\n\n-3rd in MLL History with 449 career points\n\n-9th in MLL History with 121 career games played\n\n-2nd in MLL History with 37 career playoff points\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the entire Cannons organization and fan base I want to thank Ryan for being a part of the Cannons family for the past 6 seasons. He is one of those special players that is every GM desires to have. A true professional on and off the field who gives everything he has for his team, his teammates and the fans who come to see our team play.\u201d Cannons Vice President & GM Kevin Barney said.\n\n\u201cRyan helped bring the first championship to our franchise in 2011, a team that will go down in our history books. I wish Ryan all the best and know he will continue to help our sport grow in his future endeavors.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.usalacrosse.com/us-men-all-time-rosters", "page_content": "The ILF event came to the United States for the first time in 1982 and the U.S. recaptured the championship trophy in Baltimore with a 22-14 victory over Australia.

His collegiate career, as part of arguably the nation\u2019s best team in the late 1990s and early 2000s under coach Bill Tierney, ended with a victory over Syracuse in the 2001 title game. Striebel also played soccer for the Tigers.\n\nHe won three MLL titles in eight seasons with the Barrage, including the clinching goal against the Boston Cannons in 2004, and will return this spring for another season with the Rochester Rattlers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it now more than ever,\u201d Striebel said of his 12th MLL season. \u201cNow that I\u2019m coaching, I\u2019m itching to get back out there playing.\u201d\n\nStriebel\u2019s coaching experience includes a stint as an assistant at his alma mater and with the club team at Iowa, from where he received his master\u2019s degree. His coaching style borrows from all the coaches he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the best coaches in lacrosse,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThe sincerest form of flattery is stealing things, copying things.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils (6-12 last year) return one first-team All-Scholastic selection from last season, senior midfielder Colin Sawula. The team captain netted 23 goals and 16 assists a season ago.\n\nSawula and fellow senior captains Jay Messer, Andy Kuon and Justin Golec all see a major difference already in what their new coach has been able to get out of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompared to last year, it\u2019s completely different,\u201d said Sawula, who has had three coaches in four years. \u201cWe\u2019re out there working hard every day. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve run more this year than we have last year. I have really high hopes for this season.\u201d\n\nOne of those previous coaches, Bill Metzger, is back as an assistant, giving Northampton some continuity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an experience,\u201d Messer said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely prepared.\u201d\n\nStriebel observed the Blue Devils several times last season and noticed a team that just needed a spark to get it to reach its full potential and to change the feeling of mediocrity that the players had.\n\n\u201cI saw a team that could benefit from some coaching, some discipline and some plans,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThe biggest thing is getting over the sense of this (losing) is who we are.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils are ready to respond.\n\n\u201cHe wants us to work hard, and we come out here every day to work hard,\u201d Kuon said. \u201cWe\u2019re determined.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/06/07/boston-cannons-fall-rochester-rattlers/8KTpMybMV2VNg9qf77HyeM/story.html", "page_content": "Matt Poskay completed a hat trick for the Cannons when he scored to knot it at 14 at 13:30 of the fourth, but Rochester\u2019s Steve DeNapoli cashed in off the faceoff 10 seconds later and John Ranagan finished a hat trick of his own to provide the final margin.\n\nBoston took a two-goal lead into the final quarter, but the Rochester Rattlers exploded for five in the fourth to down the Cannons, 16-14, in a Major League Lacrosse match Friday night in Kennesaw, Ga.\n\nBoston (1-5) got two goals and two assists from Paul Rabil and a goal and three assists from Pat Helm.

In MLL offseasons, Striebel played three years of professional soccer from 2002-04 for the Western Massachusetts Pioneers of the USL Second Division.\n\n\u201cHis fitness level was just off the charts,\u201d said former Philadelphia Barrage head coach Tony Resch. \u201cHe could keep going and going. He had great speed. He could shoot it. Unselfish. All the things you look for in a midfielder, he had it.\u201d\n\nWhile Resch and most fans may remember Striebel as a lights-out shooter, that wasn\u2019t always the case. Prior to his senior year at Princeton, Striebel was an X attackman. When freshman Ryan Boyle stepped on campus, Striebel was moved above GLE \u2013 where, Boyle jokes, his shot couldn\u2019t break a paper bag.\n\n\u201cHe completely reinvented himself, starting with his senior year at Princeton moving from behind the cage out in front to midfield,\u201d said Boyle, who also played with Striebel on the Philadelphia Barrage. \u201cHis dedication to his craft is truly remarkable. Going from somebody who didn\u2019t really have much range to speak of at all to being somebody who you had to pick up at 16 yards\u2026 he was unguardable.\u201d\n\nThat work ethic led to a 171-game career. Striebel evolved to earn playing time on the \u201804 Barrage midfield unit featuring Blake Miller (46G, 11A), Roy Colsey (25G, 6T, 7A), Mike Mollot (11G, 8A), and Doug Shanahan (12G, 6A).\n\nStriebel stuck the eventual game-winning goal in the \u201804 MLL Championship for that Barrage squad.

These are their stories.\n\nMatt Striebel was out to lunch with his wife and two kids, and then he saw his phone ring. He didn\u2019t recognize the number, so he let it go straight to voicemail, as one does.\n\nThe message, he quickly realized, was from US Lacrosse. It was right around the annual giving time for the men\u2019s national team, Striebel said, so he called back to let them know his check was ready to be sent out.\n\nBut on the other line was Rick Lake, men's game senior manager at US Lacrosse. His message was a tad different.\n\n\u201cHe goes, \u2018Matt, we're actually calling you to let you know made the Hall of Fame,\u2019\u201d the Gill, Mass., native recalled. \u201cIt was an amazing moment that was made doubly better that I found out I was going in with Ryan (Boyle). As soon as I hung up that phone call, I called Ryan and was like, \u2018This is crazy. Can you believe it?\u2019 It was the perfect, poetic bookend to a journey of our playing careers.\u201d\n\n\"We tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?\" \u2014 Matt Striebel describing a meeting Bill Tierney his senior year.\n\nStriebel is one of nine set for the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame\u2019s Class of 2019, entering with his close friend, Boyle \u2014 a fellow champion at Princeton, with the U.S. national team and in Major League Lacrosse. They now work together at Trilogy Lacrosse, the company Boyle co-founded, though their roots extend back to 2001 at Princeton.\n\nThe Tigers, then coached by fellow Hall of Fame member Bill Tierney, had Boyle entering as a blue-chip recruit down on attack. Striebel, a captain and returning All-American on attack, was excited by playing with a player of his quality. Plans went another direction, though.\n\n\u201cWe tried to coexist for two games, then I went into the coach's office and they basically looked at me and said \u2018Striebs, it's been a great run. How about you try midfield?,\u2019\u201d said Striebel, who gave himself 24 hours to sulk before embracing his new role.\n\n\u201cI decided it's my senior year, I really want to win and am here to win a national championship. From a lacrosse standpoint, it's the best thing that could have happened to me, because I am more of a midfielder talent-wise and it made us a better team and opened opportunities on the U.S. team and as a professional.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not hyperbole from Striebel, either. That 2001 season marked Striebel\u2019s second national championship while at Princeton, as well as a fourth straight Ivy League championship. On the national stage, he captured gold at the World Lacrosse championships in 2002 (Perth) and 2010 (Manchester), plus silver in 2006 (Ontario).\n\nStriebel also secured three MLL championships (2004, \u201806, \u201807) with the Philadelphia Barrage, earning earning MLL All-Star honors on nine occasions. Boyle was right there at nearly every step.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m far happier for him than I am for myself,\u201d Boyle said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI often say there are some guys out there who are A-plus in a couple categories. Oh, he's an A-plus shooter or an A-plus dodger,\u201d Striebel began. \u201cFor me, I think I just had the versatility to be B-plus, A-minus guy in a lot of different categories. That allowed me to change and adapt my game as I got older.\n\n\u201cThe first 10 years I was in the MLL, I think I took one two-point shot and it was on an open goal when we needed goal differential for the playoffs. Then as I got older, like a basketball player who's adding a different aspect, I became more of a shooter so I could develop other parts of my game and maintain relevance as a player.\u201d\n\nBut like most great players, Striebel\u2019s connection with the game didn\u2019t cease once he put away the pads and cleats. He\u2019s spent the last seven years coaching at Northampton High School in Massachusetts, plus working for Trilogy. He\u2019s especially close with coaches in the Colonial Athletic Association, so he\u2019ll often swing by nearby UMass-Amherst to catch games and chat with old friends.\n\nThose experiences also remind Striebel of his time at Hotchkiss, in Lakeville, Conn., during the mid-1990s. He said that was the \u201cdawn of the post-graduate lacrosse era\u201d at New England prep schools, where he played alongside several NHL draft picks.\n\n\u201cYou had kids who played multiple sports at a very high level,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThere were great athletes and for better or for worse, lacrosse has become a 365-day endeavor where kids have an opportunity to play every day.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.statscrew.com/lacrosse/stats/p-striemat001", "page_content": "Matt Striebel\n\nMatt Striebel\n\nBorn: January 12, 1979\n\nIowa City, IA\n\nPosition: M\n\nHeight: 6'1\"\n\nWeight: 190\n\nCareer: 2001-2015\n\n\n\nMatt Striebel scored 225 goals and recorded 117 assists in his 167-game career with the Bridgeport Barrage, Philadelphia Wings, Philadelphia Barrage, Barrage, Chicago Machine, Rochester Rattlers , Boston Cannons, New York Lizards and Chesapeake BayHawks.

Pioneers for a few years when it didn\u2019t conflict with his MLL schedule.\n\n\u201cI think the reason I\u2019ve been as successful as I have is because of the little things and the details,\u201d Striebel said Tuesday. \u201cBut I don\u2019t talk to them a lot about what I do.\u201d\n\nAs the Blue Devils move back to the Valley Wheel \u2013 with perennial powerhouses such as South Hadley, Minnechaug Regional and defending Western Massachusetts champion Longmeadow \u2013 after five years in the Valley League, it\u2019s helpful to have a coach that has himself mixed it up with the best around.\n\nAfter starting as a youth at Indoor Action Sports in Greenfield, Striebel was a two-time honorable mention All-America at Princeton. His collegiate career, as part of arguably the nation\u2019s best team in the late 1990s and early 2000s under coach Bill Tierney, ended with a victory over Syracuse in the 2001 title game. Striebel also played soccer for the Tigers.\n\nHe won three MLL titles in eight seasons with the Barrage, including the clinching goal against the Boston Cannons in 2004, and will return this spring for another season with the Rochester Rattlers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it now more than ever,\u201d Striebel said of his 12th MLL season. \u201cNow that I\u2019m coaching, I\u2019m itching to get back out there playing.\u201d\n\nStriebel\u2019s coaching experience includes a stint as an assistant at his alma mater and with the club team at Iowa, from where he received his master\u2019s degree. His coaching style borrows from all the coaches he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the best coaches in lacrosse,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThe sincerest form of flattery is stealing things, copying things.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils (6-12 last year) return one first-team All-Scholastic selection from last season, senior midfielder Colin Sawula. The team captain netted 23 goals and 16 assists a season ago.\n\nSawula and fellow senior captains Jay Messer, Andy Kuon and Justin Golec all see a major difference already in what their new coach has been able to get out of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompared to last year, it\u2019s completely different,\u201d said Sawula, who has had three coaches in four years. \u201cWe\u2019re out there working hard every day. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019ve run more this year than we have last year. I have really high hopes for this season.\u201d\n\nOne of those previous coaches, Bill Metzger, is back as an assistant, giving Northampton some continuity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an experience,\u201d Messer said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely prepared.\u201d\n\nStriebel observed the Blue Devils several times last season and noticed a team that just needed a spark to get it to reach its full potential and to change the feeling of mediocrity that the players had.\n\n\u201cI saw a team that could benefit from some coaching, some discipline and some plans,\u201d Striebel said. \u201cThe biggest thing is getting over the sense of this (losing) is who we are.\u201d\n\nThe Blue Devils are ready to respond.\n\n\u201cHe wants us to work hard, and we come out here every day to work hard,\u201d Kuon said. \u201cWe\u2019re determined.\u201d"}]}
