They were just great\u2026 I just tried in the first couple of minutes to be very attentive to how much the student's got going for them and in what areas. And to try to understand what it is they hoped to get out of the lesson. I suppose after that the most important thing is you have to be comfortable surrendering everything you know. There can be no hidden secrets. You can't hold back and have that thought like, \u2018If I show this guy how to do this then he'd steal it from me. He might get more famous than me.\u201d -Joe Satriani\n\n1. Steve Vai\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Steve Vai showed up to Joe Satriani\u2019s home in Westbury, Long Island, guitar in hand, with no strings attached. Vai asking Satriani to teach him how to play. This moment began a life-long friendship, and partnership between the two guitartists. Vai said, \"I took lessons with him for three years and he was very good because he didn't tell me that I had to play like him or that I had to do things this way or that way. He explained why it was important for me to figure out things on my own.\u201d\n\n2. Larry LaLonde\n\nLaLonde began playing guitar at a very young age, inspired by iconic musicians such as, Jimi Hendrix, Jerry Garcia, Frank Zappa, and more. LaLonde began taking lessons from Satriani in 1983 when LaLonde was the lead guitarist of Possessed, a trash-metal band. Satriani has explained LaLonde as, \u201cReally physically talented on the guitar. Larry was a great player \u2013 very well-versed in all forms of rock music, and played blues. Just amazing\u2026 Larry had a very unique way of looking at music.\u201d\n\n3. Rick Hunolt\n\nHunolt is a heavy metal guitarist who got his start in the band Exodus in 1983. Before joining the band he was a student of Satriani. Hunolt stayed with Exodus through the early 1980s and 1990s before rejoining the band in 2012 for a reunion tour.\n\n4. Charlie Hunter\n\nThe story starts when a young Charlie Hunter goes into a secondhand guitar shop in Berkley, California, accompanied by his mother and walks out the new student of Joe Satriani. Not many people believe that Satriani taught Hunter because of their widely different guitar styles, but Satriani did not teach a specific style of guitar playing, he solely taught him how to play guitar.\n\n5. David Bryson\n\nBryson is a guitarist and vocalist for the band Counting Crows. Known now for his unique guitar set-ups and exciting performances, Bryson got his start playing guitar with the teachings of Joe Satriani in Berkley, Caifornia.\n\n6. Kevin Cadogan\n\nKevin Cadogan began playing the guitar at the young age of 12. Early in his career he took lessons from Satriani. Cadogan\u2019s unique guitar playing has been praised by many, including producer Eric Valentine who stated, \u201cKevin is simply one of the most inventive, musical guitar players\u2026and creates a seemingly endless supply of ear catching guitar riffs. Whether its crazy alternate tuning, beating the guitar with a mic stand or using a slide like a violin bow, Kevin is always experimenting with ways to pull new exciting sounds out of the guitar.\u201d\n\n7. Alex Skolnick\n\nSkolnick first picked up a guitar at the age of nine. He first began lessons with Satriani when he was 14 and continued for 2 years. Skolnick explains Satriani\u2019s teachings as, \u201cvery strict, and very serious. It was a bit of a bold move to take lessons from him.\u201d Skolnick went onto being the lead guitarist of thrash metal band Testament, and gained his name of being one of the fastest guitarists in the world.\n\n8. Kirk Hammett\n\nHammett got his start in the band Exodus in 1983. At the time he was taking lessons from Satriani, he was asked to join the band Metallica. Satriani recalls that \u201cWhen the young Kirk Hammett was walking in the door, I thought, 'This is the future.\u2019\u201d Satriani was Kirk\u2019s teacher for two years until Satriani\u2019s album became very successful, which resulted in Hammett being his last student.\n\n9. Geoff Tyson\n\nGeoff Tyson is an extraordinary guitar player, and a student of Joe Satriani. Satriani stated that Tyson was one of two players that \"graduated\" from his lessons, Steve Vai being the other. Tyson has been said to be one of the greatest guitar players of all time and he has toured with various artists such as, Ugly Kidd Joe, Joe Satriani, White Zombie, Tora Tora, Asphalt Ballet, and many more.\n\n10. Phil Kettner\n\nKettner is the lead guitarist of the metal band Laaz Rockit. Working as a student of Satriani, Kettner learned the skills he needed to be one of the most renowned guitar players in his time."}, {"url": "https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/famous-singers-of-the-1960s/", "page_content": "By Laura Macmillan\n\nThe 1960s were an iconic decade for music. The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan all hailed from this era and produced some of the most famous songs of all time.\n\nThese singers, and many more, defined the sound of the \u201960s, setting the stage for future generations of musicians.\n\nFrom soul singers to country crooners, join us for a trip down memory lane as we look at 21 of the most famous singers of the \u201960s. Let\u2019s get started.\n\n1. Elvis Presley\n\nTop of the list, we have Elvis Presley. He began his music career when he moved to Memphis at age 13. However, it wasn\u2019t until his rockabilly \u201cHeartbreak Hotel\u201d hit the charts and sold 10 million copies at age 21 that he started his reign as the King of Rock and Roll.\n\nPresley was so popular he was met by crazed fans everywhere he went. His provocative performance style had parents worrying about the morality of American youth.\n\nIn the 1960s, Presley focused a great deal on his film career, releasing two or three per year. He released seven albums during that decade, with many songs crossing over to country, R&B, and adult contemporary charts in the US and around the world.\n\nHis hit \u201cAre you Lonesome Tonight?\u201d was #1 for six weeks and was his most popular song of the decade, although he had five other #1 hits in the \u201960s too.\n\n2. Ray Charles\n\nA unique singer in his own right, Ray Charles was first discovered when he began performing in a band with friends after moving to Seattle at age 18. Although he was blind, he never saw it as a musical impairment.\n\nCharles was a pioneer of the soul music genre, and Quincy Jones called him \u201cthe Genius of Soul.\u201d Charles was a crossover success in the 1960s, combining the sounds of country, R&B, and pop music. His two albums, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music, both went Gold in 1962.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Charles still encountered a lot of the same segregation that he had endured growing up in the south. However, he managed to influence singers from Billy Joel to Elvis and Sinatra.\n\n3. Brenda Lee\n\nNicknamed Little Miss Dynamite, Brenda Lee got her start as a child performer at ten. By 12, she was singing at the Grand Ole Opry and Vegas. She got her big break with her song \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d in 1958 when she was only 13 years old.\n\nLee\u2019s signature song, \u201cI\u2019m Sorry,\u201d became her second biggest hit in 1960 when she was 15, and she began being compared to Judy Garland. During her earliest years, she toured with stars like Patsy Cline, Mel Tillis, and George Jones.\n\nLee had 47 songs hit the US charts during the 1960s. Elvis, Ray Charles, and the Beatles were the only artists and groups to surpass this feat. Her musical career ultimately spanned five decades.\n\n4. Aretha Franklin\n\nQueen of Soul Aretha Franklin first toured with her father\u2019s traveling revival show as a child prodigy gospel singer and pianist. While traveling, she befriended gospel greats like Mahalia Jackson and Sam Cooke.\n\nFranklin was only 18 when she first signed a deal with Columbia Records, which released her first album Aretha in 1961.\n\nHer first two Grammy awards came in from her powerful cover of Otis Redding\u2019s \u201cRespect,\u201d which hit #1 on both the pop and R&B charts.\n\nFranklin dominated the charts in the 1960s, and as a symbol of black empowerment in the civil rights movement, she was asked to sing at Martin Luther King\u2019s funeral.\n\n5. Jimi Hendrix\n\nGuitar legend Jimi Hendrix had a difficult childhood, so music became a sanctuary for him. He got his first guitar at age 16 and soon began performing with his own band. In the early 1960s, he began playing backup for performers like Little Richard and B.B. King.\n\nIn 1966, he went to London, where he formed the Jimi Hendrix Experience band. Fans were awed by his stage presence, innovative electric guitar skills, and experimental sound.\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience released \u201cHey Joe\u201d in 1967, which was an instant hit in Britain. They soon followed up with \u201cPurple Haze\u201d and others.\n\nHendrix won over American music fans at the Monterey Pop Festival where he lit his guitar on fire. His performance at the 1969 Woodstock Music Festival is also legendary.\n\nSadly, he passed away in 1970 at age 27 from a drug-related incident.\n\n6. Roy Orbison\n\nThe Caruso of Rock Roy Orbison received his first guitar at 6 and created his first band when he was 13. He opened for the Beatles in 1964, receiving 14 encores.\n\nHis stage presence might have been lacking, but as Elvis put it, Orbison\u2019s three-octave voice made him \u201cthe greatest singer in the world.\u201d\n\nOrbison recorded \u201cOnly the Lonely\u201d in 1960 after Elvis and the Everly Brothers turned it down. It came to be considered pivotal to the development of rock music. His persona and lyrics were so popular because they were vulnerable when most other artists of the time were masculine.\n\nHe had nine top-10 hits and ten top-40 hits between 1960 and 1965. However, after losing his wife and two oldest sons between 1966 and 1968, he didn\u2019t generate hits again until the \u201880s.\n\n7. Patsy Cline\n\nCountry singer Patsy Cline had been performing on local radio stations and entering singing contests for nearly a decade before her 1957 television breakthrough performance of \u201cWalking After Midnight.\u201d\n\nIn the early 1960s, she joined the cast of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She also performed with Johnny Cash, June Carter, and George Jones. She was famously supportive of other country singers like Loretta Lynn, helping to launch their careers.\n\nCline\u2019s career spanned only eight years before her life was cut short in 1963 after the plane she was in crashed, which also killed other country artists. Amazingly, from the start of the decade up to 1963, she had seven pop-country crossover hits, including \u201cI Fall to Pieces\u201d and \u201cCrazy.\u201d\n\n8. Johnny Cash\n\nOne of the best-selling music artists of all time, Johnny Cash began writing songs at age 12. He taught himself guitar in the military and started playing live shows with friends.\n\nAs a part of the Tennessee Three, Cash begged for an audition with Sun Records. Sun didn\u2019t like their gospel-driven songs but agreed to record their original songs, which hit the Billboard charts in 1955.\n\nBy the early \u201860s, Cash was a country superstar. He often performed with June Carter, who helped write his signature song \u201cRing of Fire.\u201d\n\nHis personal life spiraled out of control as his career took off, but he regained traction after his marriage to Carter in 1968.\n\nNicknamed Man in Black because of his all-black ensemble when performing, Cash\u2019s career spanned fifty years. He sold over 90 million records, released 81 albums, and had 170 singles, with 13 #1 hits. Five of those #1 hits came in the 1960s.\n\n9. Bob Dylan\n\nTen-time Grammy Award winner Bob Dylan began performing folk and country songs at local caf\u00e9s as a student at the University of Minnesota.\n\nIn 1960, he dropped out of college and moved to New York, where he became a regular at the coffee shops and folk clubs of Greenwich Village. After one of these performances in 1961, he received a rave review in the New York Times.\n\nHe released his first album in 1962 and was playing 200 concerts per year by 1964.\n\nHe was influenced by Woody Guthrie, and many of his songs were politically charged. His top songs of the 1960s included \u201cLike a Rolling Stone,\u201d \u201cMr. Tambourine Man,\u201d and \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019.\u201d\n\nHe also published eight books featuring paintings and drawings, which have been shown in art galleries across the world.\n\n10. Janis Joplin\n\nEarly in the \u201960s, Janis Joplin began her career performing various gigs at folk and music festivals.\n\nIn 1966, she became the lead singer of a rock band called Big Brother and the Holding Company. After their 1968 album Cheap Thrills became a hit, she parted ways from the group.\n\nShe then launched her solo career with a historic performance at Woodstock. She became known for her powerful, gravely, blues-inspired voice and unrestrained sexual style.\n\nIn her brief career from 1962 to 1970, she had five Billboard Hot 100 rock singles, most peaking after her drug overdose death in 1970. She recorded four albums, which sold over 18.5 million copies. Her most recognizable songs are \u201cMe and Bobby McGee\u201d and \u201cPiece of My Heart.\u201d\n\n11. Marvin Gaye\n\nPrince of Soul Marvin Gaye singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist in the R&B, soul, gospel, funk, and jazz genres. He began singing in his father\u2019s church and with a group called the New Moonglows in the 1950s. It was with this group that he caught the attention of Motown Records.\n\nHe was also known as the Prince of Motown for helping create the 1960s Motown sound, and during the decade, he showcased his musical range with everything from dance hits to duets with singers like Diana Ross and Tammi Terrell.\n\nGaye\u2019s first solo top-40 hit was \u201cHitch Hike\u201d in 1962, and in 1968, his song \u201cI Heard It through the Grapevine\u201d hit #1 in the Billboard Top 100 chart and stayed there for seven weeks.\n\n12. James Brown\n\nGodfather of Soul James Brown got his musical start in an R&B vocal group called the Famous Flames. Their demo tape impressed a talent scout for King Records, and their first song reached #6 on the R&B charts in 1956. They opened for legends like B.B. King and Ray Charles.\n\nThe Godfather of Soul\u2019s career spanned over 50 years. However, he recorded his most enduring and popular singles in the 1960s. One of his most recognizable songs of the 1960s is \u201cI Got You (I Feel Good),\u201d released in 1965.\n\nThroughout his career, Brown had 17 singles reach the top of the Billboard R&B charts, and he also holds the record for the most singles on the Billboard Hot 100 that didn\u2019t reach #1.\n\n13. Sam Cooke\n\nOur next singer, Sam Cooke started out as the lead vocalist for the gospel band the Soul Stirrers at age 15. He developed a following through his recordings with the group and first branched out into a secular solo career in 1957 under the pseudonym Dale Cooke.\n\nIn 1960, he signed with RCA and had hit after hit with songs like \u201cChain Gang\u201d and \u201cTwistin\u2019 the Night Away.\u201d His blend of sensuality, spirituality, soul, and movie-star good looks rocketed him to fame.\n\nHis refusal to perform for a segregated audience was one of the first civil disobedience efforts in the 1960s civil rights movement. Sadly, his career and life were cut short when he was shot in a clash with a hotel manager in 1964.\n\n14. Bobby Vinton\n\nWhen Bobby Vinton was 16, he formed a band that played in clubs around Pittsburgh, which helped fund his college music education. The band appeared on TV Talent Scouts, which resulted in them landing a contract with Epic Records.\n\nVinton was also known as the Polish Prince since his music honored his Polish heritage.\n\nHe had four #1 hits during the 1960s. His most famous song was a cover of \u201cBlue Velvet,\u201c which reached #1 in 1963 on the Billboard Hot 100. His three other #1 hits were \u201cRoses Are Red (My Love)\u201d (1962), \u201cThere! I\u2019ve Said It Again\u201d (1963), and \u201cMr. Lonely\u201d (1964),\n\nToday, he continues to headline in Atlantic City, Las Vegas, and around the world.\n\n15. Dusty Springfield\n\nAn icon of the Swinging Sixties, Dusty Springfield first started performing with her brother Dion, forming the Springfields in the early 1960s.\n\nTheir style combined folk and pop, and they had several top-five British hits, starting in 1962. Their popularity crossed over to the US charts with their song \u201cSilver Threads and Golden Needles.\u201d\n\nSpringfield launched her solo career in 1963, becoming a fixture on pop charts around the world with numerous hits. Interestingly, only \u201cYou Don\u2019t Have to Say You Love Me\u201d hit #1 during the decade (and only in the UK).\n\nThe peak of her success came in 1969 with the album Dusty in Memphis, which featured a sound deeply influenced by early 1960s black singers and included the song \u201cSon of a Preacher Man.\u201d The song had a second round of popularity in 1994 after featuring in the film Pulp Fiction.\n\n16. Diana Ross\n\nAs a teen in the 1960s, Diana Ross began singing with friends in an R&B and pop trio that eventually became known as the Supremes and then later Diana Ross and the Supremes. Motown Records signed them, and they first reached #1 in 1961 with \u201cWhere Did Our Love Go?\u201d\n\nWith the Supremes, Ross was part of a group with the most Billboard chart-toppers in history, like \u201cYou Can\u2019t Hurry Love\u201d and \u201cYou Keep Me Hangin\u2019 On.\u201d\n\nRoss left the Supremes to start a solo career in 1969. Ultimately, 27 of her singles reached the Billboard Top 40, including \u201cAint\u2019 No Mountain High Enough.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s been nominated for a Grammy 12 times and continues touring today.\n\n17. Cher\n\nReferred to as the Goddess of Pop, Cher started out dancing and singing in small clubs along Hollywood\u2019s Sunset Strip and introducing herself to everyone in the music business. In 1962, she met Sonny Bono, who helped her get work as a backup singer for acts like the Ronettes.\n\nShe eventually married Bono, who often joined her onstage to sing harmony to help her with stage fright. Their best song was \u201cI Got You Babe,\u201d which reached #1 in 1965.\n\nMeanwhile, Cher was releasing her own solo work, competing with and eventually eclipsing her work with Bono. By the end of the 1960s, their relationship unraveled. Despite this, Cher continued recording. Her biggest hit came in 1998 with the song \u201cBelieve.\u201d She attempted retirement in 2005, but it only lasted three years.\n\n18. Stevie Wonder\n\nBlind from infancy, Stevie Wonder was indeed a child wonder. By the time he was 10, he had taught himself to play the harmonica, drums, and piano. He was only 11 when a member of the Motown band the Miracles discovered him and got him a record deal.\n\nIn 1962, at age 12, he released his debut album, along with a cover tribute to Ray Charles. That same year, his song \u201cFingertips\u201d reached #1 on both the Hot 100 chart and the R&B chart, and \u201cUptight (Everything\u2019s Alright)\u201d hit #3 in 1965.\n\nWonder faced the difficulty of staying relevant as he stopped being a boy wonder and developed into a man. However, he\u2019s probably best known for \u201cI Just Called to Say I Love You,\u201d which he released in 1984.\n\n19. Otis Redding\n\nAnother soul legend, Otis Redding joined Little Richard\u2019s former band, the Upsetters, in the late 1950s. By 1960, he\u2019d moved to Los Angeles to release singles. His song \u201cThese Arms of Mine\u201d rose to #20 on the R&B charts in 1963.\n\nRedding became known as the King of Soul for his energy in the studio, magnetic stage presence, and sincerity on stage.\n\nHe influenced many other singers of the 1960s and continues to influence artists into the present.\n\nSadly, Redding didn\u2019t live to see his 1967 recording \u201cThe Dock of the Bay\u201d reach #1 on the pop and R&B charts. He was only 26 when he died in a plane crash that year.\n\n20. Donovan\n\nSecond to last, we have Donovan, who got his start in the folk scene at local Scottish clubs. He got a contract with Pye Records in London after sending a 10-track demo tape.\n\nIt included his first single, \u201cCatch the Wind,\u201d which was influenced by Woody Guthrie, and some even called him a Bob Dylan clone at first.\n\nBy 1966, Donovan had shed his Dylan/Guthrie persona to become one of the first counterculture British pop musicians. He became more creative in his music, immersing himself in blues, jazz, and Eastern music.\n\nDonovan\u2019s biggest hit, \u201cSunshine Superman,\u201d was released in 1966 and went Gold. He became an international success and hasn\u2019t stopped producing music, with his last single released in 2021 for his 75th birthday.\n\n21. Van Morrison\n\nLast on our list is Van Morrison. He formed the first of several childhood bands in Ireland at the age of 12. By the time he was 17, he was touring Europe with his group the International Monarchs.\n\nThey released their first recording in Germany in 1963. He then went on to perform with rock band Them, who had three chart hits in 1964 and 1965.\n\nIn 1967, Morrison launched his solo career in New York. His song \u201cBrown Eyed Girl\u201d spent sixteen weeks on the charts. In fact, in 2015, it was rated as the most-downloaded song of the 1960s.\n\nThe song has been listed as #21, 49, and 110 on VH1, MTV, and Rolling Stone magazine lists, respectively, of best pop or rock songs of all time.\n\nSumming Up Our list Of Famous \u201960s Singers\n\nAs evidenced in the list above, the 1960s were home to some of the most famous singers in music history.\n\nThe decade gave birth to many genres that crossed racial and cultural boundaries. There was something for everyone, including the groovy bass of singing groups, the hip-gyrating sounds of rock and roll, or the sad ballads of country artists.\n\nWe hope you enjoyed learning about famous singers from the 1960s. However, this list is just the tip of the iceberg of all the amazing vocalists active in the decade.\n\nWho did we miss off our list? Let us know and we\u2019ll add them in!"}, {"url": "https://guitaristnextdoor.com/in-what-age-did-famous-guitarists-start-playing/", "page_content": "Last Updated on April 29, 2023 by Teemu Suomala\n\nIf you want to be a guitar virtuoso, you have to start at a young age right? Well, based on the starting ages of guitar legends, that usually seems to be the case (not a rule though).\n\nBut for example, Jimi Hendrix started at the age of 15 years and only played for 12 years before he passed away. And still, many people consider him to be the best guitar player of all time. So that at least reveals that you don\u2019t have to spend decades playing guitar in order to become amazing. And personally, I believe that you can become a virtuoso even if you start playing after the age of 20.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the cool infographic that reveals more, plus we will take a quick look at the origins of 4 Key Guitar Players featured in this research.\n\nAuthor: Teemu Suomala I first grabbed the guitar in 2009. I started this website in January 2020 because I couldn\u2019t do window installation anymore due to my health problems. I also noticed that most guitar websites don\u2019t do a really good job, so I decided to just go for it! I got lucky and managed to get awesome people to help me with my website. I also got lucky because I have you visiting my website right now. Thank you. I do all this for you guys. If you have any recommendations, tips, or feedback, just leave a comment, I would love to chat with you. I have been fortunate to produce content for several large guitar websites, such as Songsterr, Musicnotes, GuitarGuitar, and Ultimate Guitar. I spend my spare time exercising and hanging out with my wife and crazy dog(I guess that went the right way\u2026).\n\nIn What Age Did Famous Guitarists Start Playing?\n\nCheck this cool infographic we made:\n\n4 Key Players\n\nTo me, these 4 players are the most influential guitarist featured in this article. Each of them had a huge impact on guitar players all over the world, to this day. Let\u2019s take a quick look at the start of their guitar journeys.\n\nOur Favorite Music Store in The World!

Hendrix bought his first guitar (acoustic) from his friend for $5 in the summer of 1958, he was 15 years old. He was left-handed, but the guitar was made for right-handed people. Hendrix flipped the guitar upside down and the rest is history.\n\nHendrix is notorious for being featured at the top of \u201cbest guitarists lists\u201d. Check Rolling Stones and Really Simple Guitar\u2019s excellent guitarists round-ups for example.\n\nJimmy Page\n\nStarting age: 12\n\nOther guitarists from Page\u2019s school taught Page the first chords. Page also took some traditional guitar lessons, but he is mostly self-taught. Jimmy Pages Definitive Biography also reveals that one of his key learning methods was to listen to records and learn from there. Page and Skiffle group/band he was part of appeared in a \u201cAll Your Own\u201d TV show in 1957, Page was only 13 years old. This young Skiffle group featured on the show had reshersals on Page\u2019s house once a week. On that show, Page revealed that the Spanish guitar was one of the styles he liked to play.\n\nEric Clapton\n\nStarting age: 13\n\nClapton got an acoustic Hoyer for his 13th birthday. But this budget guitar was really hard to play and Clapton briefly lost interest in guitar playing. But it\u2019s awesome that he eventually grabbed the guitar again.\n\nClapton\u2019s Autobiography reveals that the first electric guitar the Slowhand got was double-cutaway semi-hollow Kaye. The same model his idol Alexis Korner played. It\u2019s claimed that it was purchased for 100 pounds with his grandparents assistance.\n\nEddie Van Halen\n\nStarting age: 11\n\nIn 1966 parents of the Van Halen\u2019s bought Eddie a drum kit and his brother Alex a flamenco guitar. But Alex\u2019s mastery over the drums, turned Eddie down and he started learning the guitar(I think we all are grateful that he did). Eddie was only 11 years old back then. At the age of 12 Eddie got his first electric guitar, $100 Teisco Del Rey. This allowed him to play the music he loved and was definitely 1 important milestone that helped him to become the guitar virtuoso he was.\n\nFAQ\n\nHow I Identified The Starting Ages of These Famous Guitarists?\n\nBy doing research.

While a student at the University of the Pacific he turned to electronic music, completing his first musique concr\u00e8te piece in 1968; four years later, Stearns returned to Tucson to open his own recording studio, subsequently producing a series of advertising jingles. In 1974, choreographer Emilie Conrad convinced him to move to Los Angeles to serve as the resident composer at her Continuum Studio; in the process of creating spontaneous live accompaniment for the dance group's groundbreaking explorations of human movement, Stearns developed a unique sound combining synthesizers and environmental samples, over time incorporating increasingly exotic instrumentation as well.\n\nIn 1977 Stearns released his debut album, Ancient Leaves, on his own Continuum Montage label, its space music aesthetic anticipating the coming rise of new age. Efforts including Morning Jewel and Planetary Unfolding followed as he developed The Beam, a 12-foot-long aluminum shaft strung with some two-dozen piano strings designed to generate low frequencies; in 1983, Stearns also collaborated with composer Maurice Jarre on Dreamscape, the first in a series of innovative film scores. His fifth solo album, Lyra, was performed on George Landry's mammoth Lyra Sound Constellation, an instrument comprised of 156 microtonally tuned strings of lengths up to 20 feet. In 1984, Stearns began a longstanding collaboration with filmmaker Ron Fricke that first yielded the soundtrack to the groundbreaking IMAX production Chronos; that same year, he also founded M'Ocean, a studio situated in Santa Monica, CA. (An album of the same name followed in 1985.)\n\nIn addition to 1986's Plunge, Stearns reunited with Fricke for the short film Sacred Site; soundtracks to two more IMAX productions, Seasons and Time Concerto, further solidified his reputation as one of the most innovative film music composers of the moment, highly regarded for his manipulation of multi-channel Surround Sound technology. In addition to subsequent albums including Encounter and Desert Solitaire (the latter a collaboration with Steve Roach and Kevin Braheny) as well as IMAX scores like Ring of Fire and Tropical Rain Forest, Stearns also designed the soundtracks for several rides at the Universal Studios theme park. After another collaboration with Fricke resulted in 1991's much-celebrated Baraka, he relocated to Santa Fe, NM, to build a new recording facility, Earth Turtle Studio. Singing Stones, a joint work with Ron Sunsinger, followed in 1994, and a year later Stearns released The Lost World. The Light in the Trees followed in 1996 and Sorcerer was issued four years later."}, {"url": "https://studentofguitar.com/12-string-guitar-players/", "page_content": "If you\u2019re interested in famous 12 string guitar players, you\u2019ve come to the right post!\n\nI don\u2019t often write about the 12 string guitar.\n\nInstead, I usually write about guitar-related instruments and how they relate to the standard guitar like in this article.\n\nHowever, I wanted to write about something different in this post.\n\nSo for this article, I\u2019ll be discussing famous 12 string guitar artists.\n\nLet\u2019s get to it!\n\nThe 12 string guitar is an instrument that has been around since the early 20th century! That\u2019s over 100 years of history!\n\nThis guitar has the original six strings in six different courses, meaning there is two of each string.\n\nThis is two 6th strings, two 5th strings, and so on.\n\nThe resulting tuning of this system would look like this:\n\n6th course: one low E string and a one high E string (one octave higher)\n\n5th course: one low A string and a one high A string (one octave higher)\n\n4th course: one low D string and a one high D string (one octave higher)\n\n3rd course: one low G string and a one high G string (one octave higher)\n\n2nd course: Two B strings\n\n1st course: Two high E strings\n\nAs you can see, there are 12 strings total tuned EE-AA-DD-GG-Bb-Ee\n\nOne of the most amazing things about the 12 string guitar is the \u201cechoing\u201d effect it has when playing chords or leads.\n\nDue to the string pairing, the sound does not come out exactly at the same time from each string.\n\nThe sound tends to \u201cphase out\u201d a little, creating this wonderful shimmering effect that we all know and love.\n\nThe Best 12 String Acoustic and Electric Guitars\n\nBefore we dive into these guitarists, if you\u2019re feeling inspired by the 12 string and don\u2019t own one yourself yet, I have some recommendations.\n\nEntry-Level Acoustic Pick Vangoa 12 String Acoustic Electric Guitar This is a great starter acoustic instrument with hundreds of positive reviews!

Chet Atkins\n\nChet Atkins - Malaguena\n\nWatch this video on YouTube I had trouble finding a video of Chet playing on the 12 string, but here he is on a 6-string!\n\nChet was an incredibly accomplished musician whom many credit with creating (at least in part) the country sound we know of today.\n\nThough he died in 2001, his legacy in country music is hard to overstate, even today.\n\nWith guitars named after him and virtuosos crediting him as a major influence, Chet certainly deserves a spot on this list as an accomplished 12-string player.\n\n19. Doyle Dykes\n\nDoyle Dykes: Fingerstyle Playing on a 12-String Guitar\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nSpeaking of virtuoso guitar players, Doyle Dykes is an amazing 12-string player (who also credits Chet Atkins as being a major musical influence in his life).\n\nIn fact, many consider him one of the best fingerstyle guitar players in the world, being particularly famous for his guitar medleys.\n\n20. Gordon Lightfoot\n\nGordon Lightfoot - Early Morning Rain (Live in Chicago - 1979)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nOne of the oldest active guitar players at the moment, Gordon Lightfoot is another name that comes to mind.\n\nIn particular, Lightfoot is responsible for helping define folk-rock music.\n\nAnd, of course, as it goes with the genre, 12-string guitars have their serious use there.\n\nHe\u2019s been pretty famous for his use of Gibson\u2019s B-45-12N.\n\nIn fact, you can see this particular guitar model on the cover of 1974\u2019s \u201cSundown\u201d record.\n\nAnd the album\u2019s title track is just one of the examples of how he knew to implement this fine instrument.\n\nHowever, we can\u2019t ignore the greatness of \u201cEarly Morning Rain.\u201d\n\nIn this piece, a 12-string guitar serves its purpose as a backing instrument.\n\nBut although it complements vocals and the pedal steel guitar on top, it also fills the space with some additional sonic content.\n\n21. Bruce Cockburn\n\nBruce Cockburn - On Twelve String\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nCanadian folk-rock musician Bruce Cockburn is one of the genre\u2019s most prolific artists.\n\nHis work started in the late 1960s, and Bruce still keeps his same signature style alive.\n\nMost importantly, 12-string guitars have been very important in his work.\n\nBruce had a very interesting approach to both writing and performing music.\n\nWhile he\u2019s mostly known for playing 6-string guitars, the addition of 12-strings just made things more interesting.\n\nIt added a new dimension to his generally very sophisticated playing style and technique.\n\n22. Neil Young\n\nNeil Young 5-18-92 Clev Music Hall 12 Powder Finger.mpg\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what genres you are into.\n\nIf you play guitar, Neil Young is one of the musicians whose music you just need to know.\n\nThe legendary singer-songwriter has changed our approach to acoustic guitars.\n\nSure, he\u2019s not exactly your virtuoso kind of player.\n\nHowever, you always know that it\u2019s Neal when he starts playing.\n\nAlthough 12-string guitars weren\u2019t that prominent in his music, there are some great examples.\n\nAnd when he plays it, he brings the instrument up to its full potential.\n\nYou can actually hear how full things can sound on a 12-string guitar.\n\n12 String Guitar Players: Conclusion\n\nI hope this post has helped you get a better understanding of some famous 12 string guitar players who use this unique instrument!\n\nLet me know in the comments if you have questions or if one of your favorite 12 string guitar players is missing from this list (and I need to add him or her)!"}, {"url": "https://acousticguitar.com/makers-shakers-after-50-years-at-the-forefront-of-the-guitar-repair-industry-dan-erlewine-is-at-the-top-of-his-game/", "page_content": "Dan Erlewine just might be the most famous guitar repairperson on earth. His books\u2014including Guitar Player\u2019s Repair Guide, How to Make Your Electric Guitar Play Great, Guitar Finishing Step by Step, Fret Work Step by Step, and Trade Secrets\u2014are definitive reference works that have stood the test of time. His classic columns for Guitar Player and Bass Player magazines (as well as his decade-plus relationship with Vintage Guitar) have helped introduce the vocabulary of guitar setup to the masses, and his instruments have found their way into the hands of icons such as Jerry Garcia, Albert King, and Otis Rush. But it\u2019s Erlewine\u2019s pioneering instructional content\u2014a slew of VHS tapes, DVDs, and YouTube videos, mostly for guitar-tool juggernaut StewMac\u2014that have made the Athens, Ohio, resident a mentor to three generations of guitar maintenance and repair geeks.\n\nToday, at 76, Erlewine remains the company\u2019s most recognizable face on social media and YouTube, and he still gets animated talking about necks, nuts, frets, and other crucial components of a great guitar setup. In his videos, he\u2019s surrounded by tools of his own invention\u2014most of which are available at StewMac\u2014and his calm demeanor imparts a sense of methodical zen that inspired one YouTube commenter to dub him \u201cthe Bob Ross of guitar.\u201d He\u2019s unflappable and no-nonsense but warm, grandfatherly, and even funny sometimes. When he picks up a guitar, however, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s more than just a very good repairman.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that after all these years, there\u2019s still uncharted territory for Erlewine, but the new Iris Guitars DE-11 proves otherwise. His first signature guitar, based on a beloved 1937 Kalamazoo KG-11, features a 1930s V-shaped neck, Rickard rear-mount banjo tuning machines, an Adirondack spruce top, a satin finish, as well as Honduran mahogany back, sides, and neck. Most intriguing, its neck extends past the nut before transitioning into the ears of the peghead, and threaded brass inserts in the fingerboard accept screw-down capos. \u201cIt\u2019s the most musical new guitar I\u2019ve ever owned,\u201d says Erlewine.\n\nThe Domino Effect\n\nErlewine\u2019s roots as a player and repair nerd go back to his childhood in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His mother, an artist, and his father, a businessman by day and woodworker at home, encouraged Dan and his brothers to use tools, paint, and wood. When Erlewine got his first six-string, a Stella-like Domino, he stripped, sanded, and refinished it. Soon, he was putting inlays in friends\u2019 instruments, and it wasn\u2019t long before he found his way into the Herb David Guitar Studio (\u201ca true acoustic music store\u201d), where he swiftly moved from selling guitars and giving lessons to working in repairs.\n\nErlewine\u2019s parents\u2019 record collection\u2014especially albums by Lead Belly, Marais & Miranda, and Josh White\u2014primed him for the late-\u201950s folk craze. \u201cMy earliest influence was folk music; Bob Dylan with Michael Bloomfield was the reason I strayed into electric guitars and played in electric bands,\u201d he says. \u201cBut for the last 20 years, I\u2019ve focused on playing the roots music I started with.\u201d In the \u201950s and \u201960s, Ann Arbor was a folk music hotspot, and working at the Herb David Guitar Studio gave Erlewine the opportunity to meet and hear artists like Bob Dylan, Andr\u00e9s Segovia, Sabicas, Carlos Montoya, Julian Bream, Jesse Fuller, Reverend Gary Davis, Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers, and Doc Watson, as well as Clarence and Roland White with the Kentucky Colonels.\n\n\u201cBob Dylan\u2019s first record, with \u2018Man of Constant Sorrow,\u2019 led me down the folk music rabbit hole,\u201d he says. \u201cIn 1960, I bought Pete Seeger\u2019s Folksinger\u2019s Guitar Guide, which came with a book and a record. I bought my Herco thumbpicks and fingerpicks, learned \u2018Railroad Bill\u2019 from that record, and was fingerpicking away.\u201d The arrival of the Kentucky Colonels was another seminal event. \u201cThey came to Ann Arbor in \u201963 or \u201964 to do a two-week stint at the Golden Vanity, a coffeehouse I managed at night, and Clarence White became my new hero,\u201d Erlewine remembers. \u201cClarence taught me to play \u2018Wildwood Flower,\u2019 a song I already knew, but he crosspicked it. He called his technique McReynolds picking [after bluegrass mandolinist Jesse McReynolds], and he told me to get Doc Watson\u2019s new record. That\u2019s when I got my first flatpick.\u201d\n\nBuilding a Legacy\n\nAs much as he loved playing, Erlewine decided to devote less time to \u201cmaking it big in the music scene,\u201d and in 1969, he opened Erlewine Instruments in Ann Arbor. A couple years later, he began building electric guitars; two of his most famous creations are Albert King\u2019s famed \u201cLucy,\u201d a Flying V, and Jerry Garcia\u2019s \u201cStratishcaster,\u201d a Strat with a Gibson stop tailpiece, a rosewood pickguard, and rosewood numbers inlaid in the fretboard (\u201cso Jerry would never doubt what fret he was at,\u201d he jokes). By 1975, Erlewine had moved to Big Rapids and opened a new shop, Dan Erlewine\u2019s Guitar Hospital. But his biggest innovations were yet to come.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn late 1983, his older brother, Michael, loaned him a video camera: \u201c\u2018Make videos of what you do, and you\u2019ll always be first in line,\u2019 Michael told me. \u2018They\u2019ll credit you as their teacher and it\u2019ll make you famous.\u2019 He was right.\u201d Erlewine went to a NAMM show a few months later, demoing his fret technique at the Dunlop booth, and he arranged to have his Guitar Hospital videotapes, the first of their kind, play on a monitor throughout the day. A few months later, Kix Stewart of StewMac called to say that he\u2019d seen the videos, and he invited Erlewine to join StewMac in Athens, Ohio. Dan\u2019s been there for 37 years.\n\nSix decades after he first began working with guitars, Erlewine says the internet has changed repair tutorials exponentially. He\u2019s hopeful about the future, too.\n\nACOUSTIC GUITAR: There are so many more resources for aspiring luthiers than there used to be.\n\nDan Erlewine: That\u2019s for sure! With the many books, DVDs, guitar kits, and building/repair schools, it\u2019s much easier to learn the trade. When I started, there weren\u2019t many luthiers around, and those I found wouldn\u2019t share what they knew. I had to learn on my own.\n\nSome folks might call you the godfather of guitar repair.\n\nI\u2019m not the godfather. In my generation, the godfathers were Hideo Kamimoto, who wrote Complete Guitar Repair; Don Teeter and his two-volume The Acoustic Guitar: Adjustment, Care, Maintenance and Repair; as well as Irving Sloane\u2019s Classical Guitar Construction and Guitar Repair: A Manual of Repair for Guitars and Fretted Instruments, which he researched, wrote, and then photographed in Martin\u2019s repair shop. Those guys are my godfathers.\n\nWhat you think of guitar-building schools?\n\nI tried college twice, and never lasted a whole semester, but I\u2019d have jumped at the chance to go to a guitar-building school. If one can afford it, and spend time away from work or home, it\u2019s a wonderful substitute for going to college.\n\nWhat advice do you have for a luthier who\u2019s considering going to school?\n\nLearn all you can before attending a school\u2014it will give you a head start, and you\u2019ll be more ready to learn from the outset. The internet is a good place to start. Though I\u2019m sure there are many helpful websites out there, there are two veteran repairmen whose sites I frequent because I learn so much: Frank Ford\u2019s frets.com and ianhatesguitars.com, hosted by Ian Davlin.\n\nSome people say the guitar in contemporary culture is pass\u00e9. What are your feelings on the future of the guitar and guitar repair?\n\nGuitar, pass\u00e9? No way! I see more guitars being made, sold, played, set up, and repaired today than ever. The world needs guitar makers and repairers, and new generations will go far beyond what came before them. I meet young luthiers who are already raising the bar, and many of them are graduates of luthier schools.\n\nYou still play regularly. Do you have a practice routine?\n\nSixteen or 17 years ago, I started playing every day, and with purpose. I play guitar for at least an hour before dinner. It\u2019s not practice\u2014just playing. I pick a key, play a chord, wait until something starts to form, and then go with the flow as unconsciously as possible. Soon, it turns into a melody and the basis for a song.\n\nHow did you first get into the Kalamazoo KG-11 that inspired your new collaboration with Adam Buchwald of Iris Guitars?\n\nI repaired one for a special friend around 16 years ago, and I couldn\u2019t stop remembering how it felt and sounded. I found one, did the necessary repair and setup, and it was just as good as I\u2019d remembered! I also love the size. I\u2019m not a tall guy, but I\u2019ve been playing big guitars all my life, and reaching over a jumbo guitar wasn\u2019t good for my right shoulder. Hey, short people\u2014play small guitars and you\u2019ll last longer.\n\nWhen did you decide to make your own version of the KG-11?\n\nI\u2019d wanted to for years, and I even cut up some special mahogany to make them. When one of my apprentices, Steve Miller, got a job with Iris Guitars last year, I said, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you ask if Iris would be interested in making a Dan Erlewine model like the Kalamazoo, with the built-in capos?\u201d His boss, Adam Buchwald, said, \u201cYeah, man!\u201d I sent out my Kalamazoo, they spec\u2019d it out, made one, sent it back to me, and bingo\u2014we had it.\n\nHow does the DE-11 compare to a KG-11?\n\nThe DE-11 sounds like a KG-11 made in the same batch on the same day. It has all the punch, warmth, and power I\u2019ll ever need. The DE-11 is beautifully made, and the sunburst is perfect; it\u2019s done by Dale Fairbanks, a renowned maker of 1930s Gibson-style guitars who joined the Iris team. The finish doesn\u2019t use coats of sealer or wood filler, so it\u2019s a very thin, hard, beautiful finish that lets a guitar sound \u201cold\u201d or played-in, right out of the case.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe screw-in capo is one of the most distinctive elements of this guitar. How\u2019d you come up with that idea?\n\nCapos have always gotten in the way of my fretting hand. They\u2019re clumsy, but necessary for the music I play. After I\u2019d experimented a lot with a clamp-style Hamilton capo and an extension, my longtime shop-mate Elliot John-Conry asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just screw a capo onto the \u2019board?\u201d I told him we couldn\u2019t do that, and he asked, \u201cWhy not?\u201d So, that weekend, we built screw-in capos and put them in an old guitar. I spent a couple years improving the capos until I settled on what I have now.\n\nHow do you use them?\n\nWell, it\u2019s really a capo that holds down the middle four strings. If I put it at the second fret, I\u2019ve capoed up a whole step, but the outside E strings aren\u2019t capoed\u2014which means I have a D tuning on the bottom (D, A, and D) plus G, B, and D on the top. It\u2019s great for playing the blues, folk, country, and rock styles I love. It\u2019s kind of like playing with an open tuning, but whenever I play chords I already know, I\u2019m closing the strings, and I\u2019m back in standard tuning\u2014but with open-string options that wouldn\u2019t be available otherwise.\n\nIf I want to capo up the neck with the same dropped-string effect, I use a second capo a whole step below. We also make a capo that covers all six strings which doesn\u2019t get in the way of your fretting hand. There\u2019s no comparison between that and any other mechanical capo; our capo makes it easier to execute anything you\u2019re playing in the first position.\n\nHow do you attach them?\n\nWith a mini Torx screwdriver, which puts the mounting screw flush with the top of the capo, or with a thumbscrew that tightens on top of the capo, which is less awkward and faster.\n\nHave you begun putting them in all your instruments?\n\nAll my guitars have my capos. I have a 1939 Gibson J-35, and I put capos in that. I sent wood to Gibson to make a 2001 Les Paul that looked like Bloomfield\u2019s, and I put capos in that. I also have two other electric guitars with capos for the blues and country bands that I play in.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTell me about the elongated neck.\n\nI\u2019ve always felt cramped playing certain chords in the first position\u2014E, B7, and certain F chords, for example\u2014because the neck transition to the ears of the peghead is so close. I wanted a bit more room, so we let the neck shape keep on going a little farther. Chords that were uncomfortable to the bones of my hand are no longer a problem. You\u2019d have to play one to know.\n\nDo you go back and forth to guitars with and without capos?\n\nNot often, but what I\u2019ve learned with the drop-capo thing causes me to play new music without a capo, and sometimes I\u2019m curious to see what comes out.\n\nDo you consider your screw-in capo a replacement for standard capos?\n\nNo, because it\u2019s not a capo you move around fast, although it\u2019s not super slow to change positions, either. It\u2019s the unscrewing and re-screwing that might concern live performers. But once they discover the new melodies, chords, and sounds offered by these capos, I think they\u2019ll want people to hear it, and I believe they\u2019ll develop the necessary \u201cpatter\u201d to keep audiences occupied while changing capo positions.\n\nWhat else would you like to mention about the DE-11?\n\nIt comes with my favorite strings, D\u2019Addario Flat Tops Phosphor Bronze light gauge EFT16s, which have a warm, semi-bright sound and hardly any finger/string noise. The Rickard tuners are the finest, most accurate, and easy-to-tune machines I have ever used, and I think they\u2019re beautiful. These tuners, first designed by Frank Ford, have cycloidal gears, something that\u2019s never been used on a guitar before. The DE-11 is also available left-handed, or with a narrower neck for small hands.\n\nWhere do you go from here?\n\nI have the perfect guitar, and I make the best music of my life with it. Along with Adam\u2014Iris, that is\u2014I\u2019m working on an electric guitar with capos, the longer neck, as well as bolt-on replacement necks so players can have an easy way to try the system out. These capos aren\u2019t just for acoustic guitars. I bet Keith Richards would have a blast with this neck-mounted on a Tele!"}, {"url": "https://www.roadiemusic.com/blog/legendary-guitarists-that-started-playing-late/", "page_content": "Legendary Guitarists that Started Playing Late\n\nby Hussein El Annan, Mar 2, 2020 . 4 min read\n\nIn most cases, parents are proud when their kids reach a developmental milestone ahead of their peers.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a sport, academic, or an artistic achievement, the younger you are, the more talented you seem to most people. However, some humans are simply late bloomers. Here\u2019s a list of Legendary Guitarists that started playing late. And before you ask, yes, this list differs from our previous list of 7 Guitarists Who Made it Later in Life.\n\nBorn John William Cummings, Ramone grew up surrounded by rock musicians in Queens, New York. Naturally, he showed interest in music at an early age. During high school, he even played in a band for a while. The band wasn\u2019t serious about music at all.\n\nBut luck would have it, his future bandmate, Tommy Ramone played with him in the band. After Johnny finished school, he worked as a plumber for a couple of years. He met Dee Dee Ramone while delivering dry cleaning and the two struck a friendship quickly.\n\nOnce they realized they shared the same passion for music, they decided to go to a music store nearby. They started jamming and after some time, Johnny called his old band member Tommy to play with them. At the age of 26, Ramone started a band that would change the history of pop music.\n\nChuck Berry was born in 1926 while the racial tension was still pretty high in the United States. Although his parents were doing pretty well for themselves, they still lived in the impoverished part of the city. Like many children in his day, Chuck was wowed by local small-time criminals in his neighborhood.\n\nHe had his first musical performance at the age of 15, however, his musical career completely stopped soon after. Just three years after his first performance, Berry was arrested. He was charged for multiple robberies, grand theft auto, and carrying an unregistered firearm.\n\nHe was released in 1947, after spending only 3 years in the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa. After getting out, he didn\u2019t start playing professionally until he was almost 30 years old. He, nonetheless, managed to become one of the most influential people in the history of rock and roll.\n\nSince You\u2019re Here\u2026 Fast-track your guitar learning journey, with the Ukulele and Guitar Coach App by Roadie Music.

While most guitarists start playing before they start school, James waited a little longer. By \u201clittle longer\u201d we mean that he waited until his retirement to start taking music more seriously.\n\nJames was born around 1920, although he doesn\u2019t know his real date of birth. He had a rough childhood, didn\u2019t attend school, and some sources say that he has more than 25 children. He was also sentenced to 10 years in jail for murder, however, he only served 2 years before being paroled.\n\nAt the age of 75, his 5th wife gave him a guitar as a birthday present. While he didn\u2019t know how to read notes, he started playing each day. Somehow, James got really good quickly. Buddy Guy, a famous blues singer discovered him and helped him sign a contract. He released his first album at the age of 77.\n\nNow that you\u2019re familiar with some legendary guitarists that started playing late, on the other end of the spectrum you can take a look at \u201c4 Kids With Extraordinary Guitar Talent\u201d.\n\nWho are your favorite late bloomer guitarists? Tell us all about it by leaving a comment below."}, {"url": "https://midlifeguitar.com/famous-guitarists-who-started-late/", "page_content": "Learning how to play the guitar \u2013 it\u2019s not just for kids, anymore. Truth be told, it never was. Musical instruments are not to be pigeonholed to a particular age group; there is no age ceiling. There are many shining examples of players who got their start later in life. Some of them you may have heard of and if you haven\u2019t, you will have some names to add to your playlist.\n\nThere\u2019s a misconception that learning an instrument is harder to do as an adult. It\u2019s more difficult in the sense that life is busier and responsibilities are greater, so making time for it takes more intentionality. However, you will not somehow have a limitation on how well you will be able to play based solely on your age.\n\nMany adults will believe that learning to play guitar is the same as learning a new language as an adult (which is harder), but it\u2019s much different in that unlike language, there is no central music area of the brain. Adults even have an advantage over child students since they have more developed brains, they can see and hear things in music that a child cannot.\n\nNo need to take the word of various neuroscientists, though. Check out some of these real-life examples of famous late bloomer guitarists.\n\nIf you are more of a visual person then watch my video below.\n\n1. Wes Montgomery: 20 years old\n\nJohn Leslie Montgomery was born in 1923 in Indianapolis. One evening while dancing with his wife as a newlywed, Wes heard Charlie Christian for the first time. The very next day, he went out and got his own guitar and spent the next year or so trying to play like Christian. Having taught himself to play, he was soon playing in clubs as a twenty-year-old newbie. By day he worked as a welder at a milk company, but by night, he was out playing, imitating those Charlie Christian solos.\n\nA few years later in 1948, jazz musician Leo Hampton was on tour with a stop in Indy where he heard Wes play. He just so happened to be looking for a guitarist and here was this guy playing in a club who sounded a lot like Charlie Christian! He had a unique way of playing with the side of his thumb. It was a soft attack but he maintained rhythmic drive and had a very distinct use of octaves. Montgomery was hired.\n\nWes spent the next two years in Hampton\u2019s band. He was offered opportunities to play with Charles Mingus, Milt Buckner, and Fats Navarro, but ultimately turned them down. He was already in his mid-thirties by the time he was getting noticed in the jazz world. He continued playing the clubs in his hometown while keeping a full-time job and supporting a wife and six kids.\n\nIn 1959, producer Orrin Keepnews had a new label and was persuaded by saxophone great Cannonball Adderley to go check out this local legend named Wes Montgomery out in the midwest city of Indianapolis. Cannonball was very enthusiastic about it, so Keepnews agreed. He checked him out at his usual gig, then by sunrise, Montgomery was signed.\n\nWes continued to work with Orrin for about five years and became quite famous. He was putting out albums very regularly, but unfortunately had his career and his life cut short by a fatal heart attack at the age of 45 in June of 1968. He won many awards, including Jazz Man Of The Year in 1967 and a couple of Grammy Awards. He is considered one of the greatest jazz guitarists of all time.\n\n2. Johnny Ramone: 24 years old\n\nHis real name is John Cummings, but you may know him as Johnny Ramone of The Ramones. He was born in 1948 in Queens, New York. He was a big Yankees fan and an avid baseball card collector. Now, he did play a little guitar as a teenager, but nothing at all serious.\n\nIn 1974, he and Douglas Colvin (soon to be known as Dee Dee Ramone) went to a music shop where Johnny bought a guitar and Dee Dee bought a bass. They collaborated with Jeffery Hyman (Joey Ramone) and Tamas Erdelyi (Tommy Ramone) and The Ramones band was formed.\n\nJohnny\u2019s technique was mostly that of a rhythm electric guitarist, playing all downstrokes, full barre chords, and a very aggressive and rhythmic attack. This was all pretty unique at the time for a guitarist. Occasionally, he did play some lead using basic pentatonic ideas. However, most solos on The Ramones\u2019 recordings were done by uncredited guests.\n\nJohnny was heavily inspired by Jimmy Page which is where his style of fast rhythmic downstrokes most likely came from. He also used a lot of gain and distortion which was another unique idea at the time. His techniques went on to inspire guitarists in the new wave of British heavy metal, alternative rock, and thrash.\n\nAlthough his playing may seem simple and he makes it look easy, almost any veteran guitar player you speak to will say that what he did on the guitar was a lot more complicated and difficult than it appears. There is beauty in simplicity!\n\nJohnny died in 2004 following a battle with prostate cancer at the age of 55. An annual memorial is held every year at Hollywood Forever Cemetary in Los Angeles.\n\n3. Chuck Berry: 29 years old\n\nChuck Berry is a household name in Rock. In fact, he is known as the \u201cFather of Rock and Roll. Born in 1926, he started playing as a young man since he had such a big interest in music. Having had his first public performance at the age of 15, his playing life was interrupted. Getting arrested for armed robbery has a way of doing that.\n\nHe was sent to the Intermediate Reformatory for Young Men at Algoa in 1944 when he was 18 for three years, having been convicted of robbing three stores and stealing a car at gunpoint. Berry would later recount in his autobiography that his pistol was non-functional. While incarcerated, he formed a singing quartet which was good enough to be allowed to perform outside the detention facility.\n\nAfter being released on his 21st birthday, he got married, started a family, and worked several jobs including as a factory worker, janitor, and beautician. He resumed his playing in the early 1950s and started playing in local clubs. With his affinity for music and his natural giftings, it wasn\u2019t too hard to get back on the saddle.\n\nIn 1955, he met Muddy Waters who suggested he hook up with Leonard Chess of Chess Records. Even though Berry was more interested in recording his own blues music, Chess liked his version of \u201cIda Red\u201d and had him record it in May of \u201855. He did so under the title \u201cMaybellene\u201d which sold over a million copies and reached number one on the rhythm and blues charts, and number five on Billboard\u2019s \u201cBest Seller in Stores\u201d chart. At almost 30 years old, Chuck Berry now had a career in music.\n\nHe went on to become one of the chief influencers and inventors of the Rock and Roll genre. His music wasn\u2019t the only thing that inspired an entire movement and subculture, but his showmanship. He created the \u201crock stance\u201d, for crying out loud. His overall musicianship and attitude birthed what we now know as rock music, which is absolutely astounding. And to think \u2013 he went from being just a normal, responsible adult with a family and a job to becoming a musical and cultural icon in less than 10 years.\n\nHe was cited as a major influence of Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, ELO, AC/DC, The Yardbirds, The Grateful Dead, David Bowie, and Buddy Holly just to name a few. John Lennon has one of my favorite quotes ever about Chuck Berry: \u201cIf you tried to give Rock and Roll another name, you might call it, \u2018Chuck Berry\u2019.\u201d\n\nAfter studying the History of Rock through the University of Rochester, I learned so much about why Chuck Berry was so influential. It wasn\u2019t his late start, it wasn\u2019t his abilities, it wasn\u2019t even his hair. It was his timing. He and so many other successful musicians didn\u2019t need to start playing at a young age or be some sort of genetic freak to make it big. They were aware of the times they were in and they spoke to culture.\n\nAt Berry\u2019s time, music was severely segregated. There was white music and there was black music and the two worlds were incredibly far apart. The genius of Chuck Berry and those like him was to be able to bring cultural groups together. One of the ways he did this early in his career was to blend in some country and western music in his repertoire while playing those clubs. With those genres mixing together to form his unique style and sound, Berry was able to reach a wider audience which was a novel idea in the fifties in America.\n\nThe cultures came together, the genres came together, and a cultural shift occurred. If you want some great inspiration, I recommend Berry\u2019s autobiography that came out in 1987. Not only will you never again say, \u201cIt\u2019s too late for me to start learning how to play guitar\u201d, but you also will not use age or season of life as an excuse for much of anything!\n\nChuck Berry died on March 18, 2017, at the age of 90.\n\n4. James Lewis Carter Ford: 70ish years old\n\nSpeaking of not being too old, James Lewis Carter Ford (a.k.a. T-Model Ford) was not in his late twenties or early thirties when he started playing. No, this cat was in his seventies!\n\nAlthough the date of his birth is not certain, his likely birthdate is listed as June 24, 1923. Ford\u2019s life is an interesting and tragic story, starting with an abusive father and continuing with a life of distress and violence. He was sentenced to 10 years on a chain gang for murder, had several wives, and an unknown amount of children, but said he had been told the number is 26.\n\nFord was illiterate and worked various blue-collar jobs including plowing fields and working at a sawmill as a foreman and truck driver, which is where he got the nickname \u201cT-Model\u201d. Following his release from the chain gang after only two of the original ten-year sentence, he stayed in trouble with the law.\n\nWhen his fifth wife left him, she left him a guitar and that\u2019s when Ford learned how to play. Different sources report different ages for when this happened with some citing he was 58 and others saying 75. Either way, he was no spring chicken when he started pickin\u2019. Being a native of Mississippi, he of course taught himself guitar so that he could play Delta Blues.\n\nHe was discovered in 1995 by Matthew Johnson of Fat Possum Records and released five albums from 1997 to 2008. In 2008, he began working with the band GravelRoad with whom he toured and played with until 2010. In 2010, he suffered a stroke but still managed to complete the tour. In 2013, he died of respiratory failure.\n\nIt\u2019s Never Too Late\n\nThese examples prove that anyone can learn how to play guitar at any point in their life. These are just famous cases. There are countless other examples out there of people you will never hear of with similar stories.\n\nIf you still arent convinced that you haven\u2019t got what it takes, regardless of age then read our article here 17 Reasons Why You\u2019re Never Too Old To Learn Guitar"}, {"url": "https://www.kugou.com/singer/info/67CSK5356FD83", "page_content": "Michael Stearns\n\nby Jason AnkenyComposer/sound sculptor Michael Stearns was born and raised in Tuscon, AZ, taking up classical guitar as a teen; in time he moved on to rock and jazz, and by the age of 16 was regularly backing top pop acts including the Lovin' Spoonful and Paul Revere & the Raiders. While a student at the University of the Pacific he turned to electronic music, completing his first musique concr\u00e8te piece in 1968; four years later, Stearns returned to Tucson to open his own recording studio, subsequently producing a series of advertising jingles. In 1974, choreographer Emilie Conrad convinced him to move to Los Angeles to serve as the resident composer at her Continuum Studio; in the process of creating spontaneous live accompaniment for the dance group's groundbreaking explorations of human movement, Stearns developed a unique sound combining synthesizers and environmental samples, over time incorporating increasingly exotic instrumentation as well. In 1977 Stearns released his debut album Ancient Leaves on his own Continuum Montage label, its spacemusic aesthetic anticipating the coming rise of New Age. Efforts including Morning Jewel and Planetary Unfolding followed as he developed The Beam, a 12-foot-long aluminum shaft strung with some two dozen piano strings designed to generate low frequencies; in 1983, Stearns also collaborated with composer Maurice Jarre on Dreamscape, the first in a series of innovative film scores. His fifth solo album, Lyra, was performed on George Landry's mammoth Lyra Sound Constellation, an instrument comprised of 156 microtonally-tuned strings of lengths up to 20 feet. In 1984, Stearns began a longstanding collaboration with filmmaker Ron Fricke which first yielded the soundtrack to the groundbreaking IMAX production Chronos; that same year, he also founded M'Ocean, a studio situated in Santa Monica, CA. (An album of the same name followed in 1985.) In addition to 1986's Plunge, Stearns reunited with Fricke for the short film Sacred Site; soundtracks to two more IMAX productions, Seasons and Time Concerto, further solidified his reputation as one of the most innovative film music composers of the moment, highly regarded for his manipulation of multi-channel surround-sound technology. In addition to subsequent albums including Encounter and Desert Solitaire (the latter a collaboration with Steve Roach and Kevin Braheny) as well as IMAX scores like Ring of Fire and Tropical Rain Forest, Stearns also designed the soundtracks for several rides at the Universal Studios themepark. After another collaboration with Fricke resulted in 1991's much-celebrated Baraka, he relocated to Santa Fe, NM to build a new recording facility, Earth Turtle Studio. Singing Stones, a joint work with Ron Sunsinger, followed in 1994, and a year later Stearns released The Lost World. The Light in the Trees followed in 1996 and Sorcerer was issued four years later.\n\n\u66f4\u591a\u4ecb\u7ecd"}]}
