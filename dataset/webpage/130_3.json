He was also capped 28 times for Scotland.\n\nBorn in Arbroath, he had played forward as a schoolboy, but when he joined the Carnoustie Juveniles club he went into goal and stayed there throughout his career.\n\nIn 1948, he was signed as a \u00a37 a week part-time professional by Dundee, to the displeasure of his dairyman father, who insisted he learn a trade. Brown complied by training as an electrical engineer. His sporting life could have ended prematurely when he broke his nose and jaw and fractured a cheekbone in a trial for the Scotland youth team, but he recovered.\n\nSix-foot-tall Brown established himself as an outstanding goalkeeper with Dundee, giving the lie to the English belief that Scottish keepers were a joke. He was agile, commanding and courageous, never flamboyant. He did his national service in the RAF, and represented it in goal. On demobilisation he became a full time professional at Dundee, much admired by his manager, former Rangers and Scotland centre-forward Willie Thornton. But competition among Scottish goalkeepers was such that Brown was international goalkeeping reserve 25 times.\n\nWith Dundee, he played 215 Scottish League games from 1950 to 1959, winning a League Cup medal in the 1951-52 season. His debut for Scotland could hardly have been more difficult or more impressive. In June 1958, during the World Cup finals in Sweden, he was picked to replace Tommy Younger against France. Scotland lost 2-1, but Brown impressed France's attacking pair, Juste Fontaine and Raymond Kopa. He continued to win caps for Scotland until November 1965.\n\nDundee, needing money for new floodlights, sold him to Tottenham in 1959 for \u00a316,500. He played 222 League games for Spurs, missing just one in their double-winning season. In 1962, he added another FA cup medal when Spurs beat Burnley in the Wembley final.\n\nFinding abundant time on his hands in London, Brown joined the sales staff of a printing company and later opened a printing firm in Soho with a partner. Things at Tottenham began to go wrong, when, early in 1964, at the age of 32, when a keeper might be expected to be in his prime, he was dropped from the team by the manager, Bill Nicholson (obituary, October 25 2004). He never fully regained his place, facing opposition from the young Northern Irishman Pat Jennings.\n\n\"It came as a tremendous shock to us when he was dropped by Spurs,\" said Ian McColl, then team manager of Scotland. \"I regard Brown as the best keeper in Britain.\" Brown angrily announced that he had no intention of playing in Tottenham's reserves. That his form had suffered was proved when he did leave Spurs in 1966 for humble Northampton Town. And there, too, he lost his place, in March 1967.\n\nThe following summer, he flew to Canada to play for the shortlived Toronto Falcons in the \"unofficial\" soccer League which sprang up that year, unsanctioned by FIFA. Because of that he and another British player were banned when he was on the point of joining non-League Hastings United. For Brown this proved a blessing, for he stayed on in Canada, taking a post with the land development section of the Ontario government, from which he retired in 1995.\n\nIn 1988, he had a heart attack which persuaded him to cut out the 40 cigarettes he smoked each day. In 1994 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but he survived that, too.\n\nHe leaves his wife Elaine, two daughters and a son.\n\n\u00b7 William (Bill) Dallas Fyfe Brown, footballer, born October 8 1931; died November 30 2004"}, {"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18276064.obituary-bill-brown-last-real-expert-still-teaching-ceramics-scotland/", "page_content": "BILL Brown, respected ceramics designer and teacher, has died at the age of 68 following a short illness.\n\nHe was an expert in his craft and gained international recognition for his knowledge of slip-casting and transfer printing. As Head of Ceramic Design at Glasgow School of Art in its final years, he unwillingly became \u201cthe last \u2018real\u2019 expert\u201d still teaching ceramics in Scotland, according to former colleague Ian Pirie, before the department closed in 2011. It was the last single degree-level programme in ceramics left in Scotland\u2019s art schools.\n\nBorn in Voe, Shetland, in February 1951, Bill was the second child of popular shopkeepers Maggie and John Brown. He left the islands when he was 18 to do a four-year diploma at Gray\u2019s School of Art, Aberdeen, becoming the first in his family to attend higher education. He specialised in ceramics and, along with Pirie, was selected for a scholarship to do a post-graduate diploma.\n\nTheir external examiner was none other than David Leach, the eldest son of the famous potter Bernard Leach. The younger Leach was so impressed with their work he recommended they apply to join the elite Craftsmen Potters\u2019 Association in London. They were accepted and became the first makers from Scotland to gain membership.\n\nBill spent the rest of the 1970s and early 1980s running a succession of potteries in Aberdeenshire and teaching part-time at Gray\u2019s. He married my mother, Anna, and had two daughters, my sister Sunni and myself. In 1984 he left his young family and moved to North Berwick, near Edinburgh, transporting a hut from outside their small cottage in Monyroads to the backyard of ceramicist Dave Cohen. He taught part-time at Glasgow School of Art, with Cohen and Archie McCall, and at Cumbria School of Art. In 1991 he left the hut, which was by then rather damp and layered with plaster dust and cigarette ash, and moved to Glasgow to take up a full-time lecturing job at GSA.\n\nArchie McCall, who became Bill\u2019s predecessor as Head of Ceramics at GSA, writes: \u201cThose who worked with him were impressed by his fierce intellect, deep knowledge and mastery of language, often including self-deprecation or a wry punchline, timed to perfection. He worked tirelessly helping students from all parts of the art school, usually long into the evenings. His advice, though often reserved for the very last minutes of any review, was always the most positive, practical and succinct, even if a gentle \u2018well, I might sleep on that idea if I were you\u2019 summed up everything there was to say.\u201d\n\nBill\u2019s teaching and research took him to many countries including Iceland, Norway, Estonia, Hungary, Malta, Russia, the United States and Australia. Although his own work explored the use of transfer printing and other industrial processes in the context of studio crafts, his interests and expertise extended to archaeological projects with the University of Glasgow, ranging from Neolithic digs on Orkney to the recreation of pots from moulds retrieved from the site of the famous Bell\u2019s pottery in Glasgow.\n\nHe also had an excellent ear for languages and music. He was fluent in Norweigan and German, and loved playing the fiddle \u2013 in particular Swedish folk tunes.\n\nThe year 2011 marked a new phase of his life, though not at first a good one. After investing decades of his life into GSA, the closure of the ceramics department left him deeply disappointed. Archie McCall recalls: \u201cOne of his most telling comments prior to the closure of the department at GSA in 2011 was simply: \u2018I don\u2019t believe that the human race spent millions of years evolving opposable thumbs just to text message!\u2019.\u201d\n\nAt this time Dad\u2019s second marriage, to Marjorie Fernie, broke down. But ever the optimist, he started making plans: a return to his native Shetland as an independent ceramics designer. The move, which he finally made in 2013, did not dampen his interest in travel and he took the chance to work with former student Sue Mifsud, who was pottery manager of the heritage pottery Ceramika Maltija in Malta at the time.\n\n\u201cHe was the lecturer with the softly spoken voice and approachable manner and never became impatient with students,\u201d Mifsud recalls. She invited him to give a series of lectures and workshops and to start rejuvenating the pottery\u2019s moulds. \u201cThe pottery is still running today with much of its success due to Bill\u2019s hard work, skill and creativity,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen back on home soil, Billbuilt a custom-made workshop and, later, a house on a croft owned by his grandparents in Voe, Shetland. On one side the croft overlooks the house in which he was born, and on the other side the view reaches across the bay to the graveyard where his parents are buried and indeed the plot where he himself would be interred.\n\nWith typical pragmatism and poetic flair, he used the ruins of his grandparents\u2019 \u2018but and ben\u2019 as a sheltered spot to grow kale and fruit bushes, and experimented with local clay and soapstone, which he collected himself. His work played on Shetland\u2019s culture and natural heritage \u2013 not to mention his acute observational skills and dry wit \u2013 and was in high demand at local galleries. He fell in love with art lecturer S\u00f3lveig A\u00f0alsteinsd\u00f3ttir, and was the happiest me and my sister had seen him for many years.\n\nTragically, he did not have long to enjoy this stage of his life. After being diagnosed with lung cancer in October 2019, his health deteriorated rapidly and he died at home on February 3, a few weeks before his 69th birthday.\n\nDad described ceramics as a \u201ctimeless material\u201d, outliving the maker and subject to re-interpretation by every successive generation.\n\n\u201cThe things we make have different meanings, the communities of makers have different places in society and a craft that is \u2018high art\u2019 in one time and place can be the lowliest of manual work in another,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever we make now may well be around in a couple of thousand years\u2019 time and will inevitably gain status in the process. Potters do have the last laugh.\u201d\n\nBill will be remembered not only as a talented artist and teacher, but also as a loving father and grandfather, who was very proud of his family.\n\nHe is survived by S\u00f3lveig A\u00f0alsteinsd\u00f3ttir, his two daughters, and three grandchildren."}, {"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12125362.a-man-of-our-times/", "page_content": "Bill Brown, aged 67, made an unmatched contribution to the development of Scottish Television. He joined the company as London sales manager, just a year after the ITV station went on air in 1957. Nurtured by the legendary Canadian press baron Roy Thomson, who first bought the Scotsman then went on to launch Scottish Television, Bill became managing director in 1966. He remained in charge until 1990, by which time he was the longest serving chief executive in the ITV federation. In 1971 he was made a CBE for his services to television and in 1984 the Royal Television Society gave him its highest honour, the Gold Medal for Outstanding Services to Television.\n\nHeld in great regard by colleagues across the UK networks, he was twice chairman of the council which oversees the ITV federal system, from 1968-70 and again from 1978-80. He was also a founding director of Channel 4, launched by his friend Jeremy Isaacs in 1982. A couple of years earlier Bill had commissioned Isaacs, a Glaswegian and then an independent producer, to make the controversial film A Sense of Freedom, the story of Gorbals hardman-turned-sculptor Jimmy Boyle.\n\nThis powerful, well-made film owed its existence to Bill's steadiness under fire. Jeremy Isaacs said in a retirement tribute last May: ``Of all the people I worked with in my time in television, I have never worked with anyone I liked more or respected more. A Sense of Freedom was a big film on a difficult subject but Bill Brown bravely stood by me and the film makers against hostile press and public opinion. He also gave marvellous support to the board of Channel 4 in the difficult early days when newspapers were calling for my sacking.'' When the old friends both got knighthoods in the same Honours List, Isaacs sent a characteristically terse telegram saying simply ``Snap''.\n\nAfter attending Ayr Academy and graduating in accountancy at Edinburgh University, Bill Brown was a lieutenant in the Royal Artillery for the period of his National Service. Bill went to work in television advertising sales where he honed the business acumen which steered Scottish Television through some difficult periods, particularly the destruction of Scottish Television's Theatre Royal studio by fire in 1969 which coincided with Thomson's sale of his shareholding.\n\nRoy Thomson's early STV, his ``licence to print money'' which funded the growth of a business empire, had mostly been content to schedule entertainment supplied by the large ITV companies in England or bought in from America. Scottish Television's original productions tended towards the cheap and cheerful, most famously The One O'Clock Gang. When Roy Thomson departed Scottish Television, propelled on his way by the Independent Television Authority, Bill Brown set about building the company's commitment to public service broadcasting.\n\nIn the 1970s and 80s, Scottish Television strengthened its local factual output with improved news, documentary, and arts coverage. It also produced popular drama series such as Taggart and Take The High Road for the UK network.\n\nFormer chairman of Granada Television, Sir Denis Forman, said: ``Network production in ITV used to be controlled almost totally by five major companies. Bill fought successfully to increase the share of output made by the smaller companies like Scottish. He was a most equable man, a great listener, but he would always lighten the scene by dropping a bit of yeast into the conversation.''\n\nThe standards Bill Brown set ensured regular renewal of the commercial broadcasting licence for Central Scotland. Shadow Chancellor and former STV producer, Gordon Brown, said: ``He had a tremendous sense of public service which was crucial to Scottish Television and his work with the arts. Bill was calm, commonsensical, and utterly straightforward.''\n\nAt the end of the eighties, after Sir Alan Peacock's report encouraging the deregulation of television, Mrs Thatcher at a Downing Street seminar denounced ITV as ``the last bastion of restrictive practices''. Bill was among those slapped down by the Prime Minister when he tried to make a reasoned defence of ITV's achievements. Henceforth his legendary equanimity evaporated when confronted by Mrs Thatcher's hostility to public service broadcasting of the kind he championed throughout his working life.\n\nDespite the introduction of an ``ITV auction'' in 1991 the company was unopposed in its application for a renewed licence for Central Scotland. After the upsets elsewhere in that franchise round Scottish Television emerged unscathed as the longest-serving ITV company still broadcasting to its original region. The director-general of the BBC, John Birt, formerly an LWT executive, said earlier this year: ``Bill Brown was at the heart of the ITV system longer than any other senior executive and I felt privileged to sit alongside him for part of that period. When Bill spoke people listened because he was a wise man with old-fashioned values and qualities of decency, gentility, and integrity.''\n\nOn his retirement as managing director in 1990, he became non-executive chairman of Scottish Television, and also served as chairman of the Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society from 1989 to 1994. He was a longtime director of Radio Clyde (founded by one of his apprentices, Jimmy Gordon), and subsequently of Scottish Radio Holdings. He also served on the boards of the news organisation ITN, and was a founder director of the GMTV consortium which won the ITV breakfast broadcasting franchise in 1993. He was a trustee of the National Museums of Scotland and received honorary doctorates from Edinburgh and Strathclyde universities.\n\nA personal interest in the arts was evidenced back in the 1970s by his enthusiasm for the restoration of Scottish Television's burnt-out studio at the Theatre Royal as the permanent home of Scottish Opera, a venture Bill undertook with friends such as Alexander Gibson, John Boyle, and Gavin Boyd. As a director of the Scottish Opera Theatre Trust he delighted in the company's artistic triumphs.\n\nHis greatest challenge in an overly busy ``retirement'' came in the chairmanship of the Scottish Arts Council with its fractious creative constituencies. Again Bill Brown brought to the role all his inherent diplomacy allied with the good sense which came from deep in his Ayrshire roots. In four turbulent years the Scottish Arts Council was devolved from the Arts Council of Great Britain, the exasperating saga of the surplus Scottish orchestra was played out, crafts were brought within the remit and large amounts of new money from the National Lottery were distributed. A senior civil servant recently volunteered his view that Bill was one of the most able chairmen the Scottish Office had ever appointed to a public body. The civil exterior masked a steely will in defence of propriety or principle.\n\nBill kept fit through gardening and his beloved golf. He was a member of the Royal and Ancient at St Andrews and latterly Captain of Prestwick Golf Club in his native Ayrshire. His unpretentious approach was encouraged by his wife Nancy with her Canadian disdain for the conceits of the class system and impatience with pomposity. Nancy shared Bill's love of the arts and they were enthusiastic attendees at events in Scotland. Three daughters, Sarah, Kate, and Jane, and son Robert also ensured that Bill was in touch with contemporary attitudes and was quickly corrected in any fogeyish tendency.\n\nIt was my privilege to work for Bill Brown at Scottish Television, first as his director of programmes from 1985 to 1990, then as managing director under his chairmanship until May of this year. Bill was intensely proud of the company he had fashioned and ambitious for its future. In the 1980s he made the funds available to expand production. By 1993 the output of programming had more than doubled and Scottish Television had also become a major supplier of programming to the ITV network. Bill was the perfect boss - equable, readily amused, tolerant of temperament and the artistic insistence on the right to fail. Crucially in a small country he protected his programme makers from untoward political and commercial pressure. This integrity and generosity of spirit made him a much-loved leader to all at Cowcaddens.\n\nPerhaps his inherent moderation made Bill appear so ageless. At his warm farewell to Scottish Television last May, a ``then and now'' photomontage showed him in 1996 almost un-changed from 1966. This eternal youthfulness makes it all the more unacceptable to his host of friends that he should be struck down so soon after retirement. The reaction to news of his sudden illness in recent weeks revealed that Bill Brown was not only one of the most respected men in public life in Scotland, but also one of the best liked. His was a life well lived."}, {"url": "https://www.deearchive.co.uk/player.php?id=999", "page_content": "Biography\n\nBill Brown was one of the greatest Scottish goalkeepers of the post-war period and is a legendary figure at both Dundee F.C. and Tottenham Hotspur. At Dundee he was a member of the 1951 League Cup winning side and represented Scotland in the 1958 World Cup, while at Spurs he was a member of the 1962 double winning side and part of the first British side to win a European trophy.\n\n\n\nWilliam Dallas Fyfe Brown was born in Arbroath on October 8th 1931 and played at outside-left as a youngster, only switching to goalkeeper when his Arbroath High School team's regular keeper had to go off injured and Bill was asked to go in goal. It was obvious from that day on that Bill was \u2018a natural\u2019 in goal and but for that quirk of fate, Scotland may have been denied one of its greatest ever keepers as Bill had even had a trial for Scotland schoolboys as a winger.\n\n\n\nAfter leaving school he began an apprenticeship as an electrician, whilst on the pitch he progressed from juvenile side Cliffburn to Junior club Carnoustie Panmure, before joining Dundee shortly before his 18th birthday. It was something of a coup for Dundee manager George Anderson to secure the services of Brown as he had been courted by various clubs including Manchester City, Sheffield Wednesday, Dundee United, Blackpool, Brechin City and hometown team Arbroath. Anderson however persuaded the seventeen year old to turn out for Dundee in a trial match against league champions Hibernian to reopen Dundee Violet\u2019s Glenesk Park and playing against the Hibs \u2018famous five\u2019 forward line was enough to persuade the impressionable Brown to sign for The Dee.\n\n\n\nBill made his debut for the Dens Park club against Clyde at Shawfield in January 1950, but it took him several seasons to become the club's first choice keeper, sharing the goalkeeping duties for a few seasons with Johnny Lynch and Bobby Henderson.\n\nTall and slim, Bill was a safe, unflappable keeper who rarely needed to be spectacular. Quick and agile he had good positional sense and great concentration, and playing behind Dundee\u2019s famous half back line of Gallagher, Cowie and Boyd, he won his first honour when he was part of the Dundee side to win the League Cup in his third season.\n\n\n\nBrown came into the side for the final sectional tie against Raith Rovers when George Anderson decided to replace Bobby Henderson after he had made some unforced errors in a 5-2 defeat against Hearts in the last tie that put Dundee\u2019s qualification from the group in jeapordy. It proved to be the correct decision as not only did Bill save a penalty at 0-0 but he also put in a determined display after he had to have his fingers strapped at half time, injuring them turning the penalty round the post.\n\n\n\nThe Dee won 3-1 to win their section on goal average ahead of Hearts and Brown kept his place in the side for the two legged quarter-final against Falkirk and for the semi-final against holders Motherwell at Ibrox where The Dee were victorious by five goals to one to book their place in the Final.\n\n\n\nIn front of 92,325, Dundee clinched the trophy with a 3-2 win over Rangers and the side became instant local heroes having brought the first major trophy back to \u2018Juteopolis\u2019 for forty-one years.\n\n\n\nBrown missed both the 1952 Scottish and League Cup Finals due to being away on National Service but by 1954, Bill had made the yellow jersey his own. It wasn\u2019t just for Dundee however that he excelled as in 1956 he was honoured for his consistent performances with a Scotland \u2018B\u2019 cap against England. The following year he made three appearances for the Scottish League against the English League, Irish league and the League of Ireland and as the World Cup in Sweden approached in 1958, Brown got two more League caps again against the English League and the League of Ireland.\n\n\n\nHis performances for the Scottish League were impressive enough for the Scottish selectors to name Brown in the World Cup squad for Sweden and he got to make his full international debut in the tournament when he took over from Tommy Younger for the final group match against France.\n\n\n\nBrown would go on to become the most capped custodian for Scotland with twenty-eight appearances; a record which stood until overtaken by Alan Rough in 1979. Of those caps he earned another three of them as a Dundee player when he played in all three matches of the 1959 British Home International Championships and it was in the match against England at Wembley in April that he caught the eye of Spurs manager Bill Nicholson who was in the process of strengthening his side.\n\n\n\nBrown would make another three Scottish League appearances while at Dens Park before Nicholson put in an offer of \u00a316,500 for him in June and the popular keeper was on his way to London after Nicholson took the night train to Dundee to secure the deal.\n\n\n\nCharacteristically calm and unfussy, yet breathtakingly acrobatic at need, Bill Brown was the last line of defence when Tottenham Hotspur became the first club in the twentieth century to lift the English League and FA Cup double in 1961, and two years later was a member of the team that thrashed Athletico Madrid 5-1 in the European Cup Winners' Cup Final, thus becoming the first British club to win a major European trophy.\n\n\n\nBrown did not conform to the popular notion of what a goalkeeper should look like at the time for although he stood half an inch over six feet, his frame was spare, stringy and seemingly insubstantial, in vivid contrast to the imposingly muscular individuals employed by most clubs to mind their nets. Every line of the Brown figure was angular, an impression emphasised by his aquiline features, although if some contemporary observers referred to him half-slightingly as willowy, there was no doubting his wiry resilience when it came to physical challenges with hulking centre-forwards.\n\n\n\nBill eventually left White Hart Lane in October 1966, spending a season with Northampton Town before emigrating to Canada where he played for Toronto Falcons. After retiring from the game he worked for a Toronto property developer and then spent many years in the employment of the Ontario Government Land Department and sadly passed away in Simcoe, Ontario at the end of November 2004 following a lengthy illness.\n\n\n\nBrown\u2019s legacy at Dens was 275 appearances where he made sixty-two shut-outs, winning one major trophy and gaining thirteen Scottish caps at various levels and left a host of memories as a keeper who was elastically agile, endowed with remarkably sharp reflexes and was never less than impeccable for Dundee.\n\n\n\nBrown was inducted into the Tottenham Hotspur Hall of Fame in 2004, the Scottish Football Hall of Fame ten years later and was inducted into the Dundee FC Hall of Fame in 2015 with a Legends Award, becoming the second goalkeeper to be inducted after his successor and friend Pat Liney in 2011.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/05/12/bill-brown-successful-insurance-broker-generation-obituary/", "page_content": "Adam Raphael in Ultimate Risk \u2013 an authoritative account of Lloyd\u2019s troubles \u2013 called the business \u201ca gold mine \u2026 By merely walking a few yards between one set of underwriters and another it was possible to make 10 per cent commission on a policy worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot understand,\u201d concurred a member of Lloyd\u2019s ruling council, \u201cwhy anyone paid Brown to march from one side of the room to another.

Bill became a member of Lloyd\u2019s in his own right in 1958.\n\nWalsham Bros remained a modest affair until Bill took over the helm from his older brother Henry, with his younger brothers Jim and Ron in support; good relations with one of Lloyd\u2019s most powerful underwriters, Roy Merrett, gave him his first opening in \u201cexcess of loss\u201d. In the aftermath of the LMX crash, the firm reverted to less controversial forms of broking, though Bill remained as hungry for business as ever.\n\nMeanwhile he enjoyed the high life his income afforded. He especially loved racing, entertaining lavishly in boxes at Goodwood, Ascot, Cheltenham and elsewhere and keeping his best horses in training with Nicky Henderson \u2013 including the nine-times winner Fondmort. But he was not a betting man, rarely venturing more than a \u00a320 flutter: if a fellow racegoer asked for a tip, he invariably offered: \u201cKeep your money in your back pocket.\u201d\n\nHe also kept a box at the Hickstead horse show and another next to Alan Sugar\u2019s at Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s White Hart Lane stadium. Summer holidays were spent in Monaco and St-Jean-Cap-Ferrat.\n\nBut Brown never courted media attention and rarely spoke to journalists \u2013 who instead repeated much-told stories about his indulgences, another of which was luxury cars. When asked which model of Ferrari he was about to order, the reply was \u201ca red one\u201d; when one of his brothers admired a top-of-the-range Mercedes in a showroom window, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll get it for you. You paid for lunch.\u201d\n\nIn similar vein, he supposedly once told a colleague he was popping out to buy jumpers. Would that be from Gieves & Hawkes, the nearby posh outfitters? Nah, came the answer \u2013 showjumpers for his elder daughters Kelly and Emma Jane, both international competitors in that sport.\n\nLess well-publicised was his support for hospice and deaf charities, and boys\u2019 projects in the East End, with which he never lost touch.\n\nBut above all Brown loved the buzz of the insurance market and the bonhomie of favourite watering holes like the City Flogger in Mark Lane \u2013 places that were never quite the same after his career was ended by the onset of dementia.\n\nHe married first, in 1957, Angela Day. The marriage was dissolved and he married secondly, in Barbados in 1989, Tracy Stone.

Brown also did many voiceovers on commercials airing on that and other New York City radio and television stations.\n\nEarly career [ edit ]\n\nBrown was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia in 1942.[2] Bill Brown began his radio career at various radio stations, including San Diego Top 40 station 136/KGB (now KLSD). Brown began working on WOR-FM (now WEPN-FM) in 1966 doing various swing airshifts, eventually becoming full-time. Initially, WOR-FM was a progressive rock station, but it evolved into an adult top 40/oldies station by 1968.\n\nIn 1969, WCBS-FM traded in their easy listening 'Young Sound' format for an album rock format similar to WABC-FM (later WPLJ) and WNEW-FM. Brown was on the original airstaff. Unfortunately, WCBS-FM could not lay claim to sizable ratings in the New York City radio market while other stations such as WNEW-FM and WPLJ gained most of the rock n'roll radio audience. After research and several years of very low ratings WCBS-FM dropped the AOR format on July 7, 1972 at 6 AM and began playing Oldies from 1955 to then current product. Initially the station played both rock and roll songs and non rock songs of the 1950s and early 60's and only softer rock and pop hits of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Brown, along with the rest of the airstaff including Don K Reed (who was hired in January 1972) all stayed on with the Oldies format. Back then, it was common for airstaffs to stay on after format changes and not as common to lay off entire airstaffs. By the end of 1972, Brown was on the station weekdays 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Saturdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.\n\nOver the next few years most of the staffers of the station would leave, but Brown and Don K Reed stayed on and were still part of the station in 1974. In 1975, Brown also became Program Director of WCBS-FM. For a few months he gave up his midday airshift. By the end of 1976, Brown was on from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays along with his Saturday morning shift. Under Brown, WCBS-FM moved away from easy listening and began to play more 60's rock. In 1978, Brown gave up his program director position but retained his airshifts. His shift was still 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. weekdays and 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. Saturdays.\n\nIn 1984, when Ron Lundy arrived, Brown was moved to 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. while Ron moved to the 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. slot. Harry Harrison now aired from 5:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. (previously he was on 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.). Bill's Saturday shift was then 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. every second week. Bill Brown also continued doing voiceovers for many commercials airing on WCBS FM and other radio stations. He celebrated 20 years in 1989, 25 years in 1994, and 30 years of service in 1999. In 1994, he officially dropped his Saturday morning airshift in honor of his many years of service at the station.\n\nAs airstaff occasionally came and went (though staffers stayed many years in most cases), Brown continued on consistently from noon to 3 p.m until 2005, when his airshift was moved to 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays. With his years of service, age, and retirements of other well known staffers it was speculated that his retirement was not far off.\n\nThe switch to JACK [ edit ]\n\nBill Brown remained at WCBS-FM until the station's two-year \"sabbatical\", which started on June 3, 2005. Although ratings were decent and the station was profitable, CBS executives abruptly laid off the entire airstaff at 4 p.m. that day. Bill Brown was the last live air personality to sign off several minutes before 4 p.m.. He came out of Margaritaville by Jimmy Buffett and played Rescue Me by Fontella Bass. It was unclear whether or not he knew the end was happening from his last statement, though he did not say a typical goodbye. His last words were, \"CBS-FM 101.1, Fontella Bass... Do you ever feel the urge to just kinda scream, \"RESCUE ME!?\"... I'm beginning to get that feeling, here's Fontella Bass.\" Other airstaffers definitely did not know the end was near as they said goodbye and stated when they would be back. The rest of the airstaff did not know what was happening until after Brown signed off and was at the meeting. In fact, half the airstaff did not even attend this meeting and were told through a conference call. These staffers could not be present because this meeting was only announced at 2 p.m. that day. At the 4 p.m. meeting, the staffers were laid off and informed that Oldies and Greatest Hits CBS-FM would be shut down immediately and replaced by an adult hits format of over 2,000 songs called, \"Jack FM\". From the 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. hour the station played 8 oldies and greatest hits with jingles in between, followed by 30 minutes of stunt montages. At 5 p.m., the jockless JACK format signed on.\n\nBrown then retired from CBS-FM after 33 years of playing oldies, as well as nearly 36 years of service. He is the only air personality to be with the station through their entire first run using live on-air personalities. He did one of their first shifts the day WCBS-FM adopted the rock format in 1969 and the very last live airshift doing oldies in 2005 (Don K. Reed was the only other air-personality to have been with CBS-FM during their entire run as an oldies station. He did the fourth shift on July 7 into July 8, 1972 and did the 4th to last live airshift from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. on June 5, 2005).\n\nBrown died on October 9, 2011 at the age of 69.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\n\u2191 Colford, Paul D.

It lasted about 45 minutes, and it held the record as the longest movie drama for a year.\n\nA year earlier, William John Bendon had founded Scotland's first film studio at Rouken Glen, Glasgow, based in a disused tramway depot. Its power supply still came from the tramway power station, so one tram passing meant the light faded, and two trams passing meant filming stopped.\n\nThe studio's first two films were unsuccessful, but in 1911 the film Rob Roy, based on Sir Walter Scott\u2019s novel, was made there, with a location trip to Aberfoyle. Also in the cast were Theo Henries as Rob Roy\u2019s wife Helen, opera singer Durward Lely, W.G.Robb and George Hunter.\n\nAnne Wade, of the Glasgow-based Scottish Screen Archive, does not believe that any copies of the film exist today. \u201cIt is unfortunately on our list of films \u2018missing, believed lost\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nBut it was on stage that John Clyde, who born in Rattray, Blairgowrie, Perthshire, on November 20 1860, made his name.\n\nHe married Glasgow-born Mary Allan on June 4 1884 in Glasgow, and they had six children. When they moved to Helensburgh, by 1890, they are thought to have lived for a time in Ardencaple Farm which was actually in Rhu.\n\nThe couple had six children, who were . . .\n\n\u25a0 John McIntosh Clyde, born in Glasgow on December 26 1884 and killed in action in France in the First World War on December 11 1916. He was known as Johnny.\n\n\u25a0 Mary Clyde, born in Glasgow on May 6 1886, who married a Helensburgh man, Adam Bain Paton, and they had one child. She died in Glasgow on April 16 1954. She ran the M.Clyde confectioners shop at 41 Sinclair Street.\n\n\u25a0 David Clyde, actor, born in Glasgow on May 27 1887, died on May 17 1945 in the San Fernando Valley in California. He married Birmingham-born actress Fay Holden, who died on June 23 1973.\n\n\u25a0 Jean Clyde, actress, born in Glasgow on March 17 1989, died in Helensburgh on June 24 1962. She married twice, actor David Urquhart who was lost at sea, then Edward \u2018Bill\u2019 McQuaid from Wishaw, who died in Glasgow in 1949.\n\n\u25a0 Andrew Allan Clyde, film actor, born in Rattray on March 25 1892, died in Hollywood, California, on May 18 1967. He married Londoner Elsie Maud Tarran in San Bernadino, California, on September 23 1932 and they had one child, John, born in 1935 and died in 1944.\n\n\u25a0 Helen Geral dine (Nell) Clyde, was born in Glasgow on December 16 1895, and died in Helensburgh on June 3 1985. She married Robert Watson from Glasgow in 1917 and they lived in Helensburgh, where he died in 1957. They had one son, Robert, born in Helensburgh in 1922.\n\nWhen Jean retired from the stage and returned to the burgh she lived with Nell in 34 John Street, where her father had died after being nursed by the family for three months.\n\nJohn Clyde ran a touring theatre company, presenting seasons of Scots plays \u2014 particularly Rob Roy \u2014 and in the company at various times were Johnny, David, Andy and Jean.\n\nJean started her stage career at the age of six months, when she was carried on as the child in Jeannie Deans during one theatre tour.\n\nShe recalled later: \u201cI was five when I made my first real appearance \u2014 as Little Willie in East Lynne. After my first performance I got a thrashing. I always thought it was unfair, for, after all, I was only five.\u201d\n\nHer first real tour was around Scottish towns with Rob Roy. \u201cLooking back on it, I wonder how I ever managed to do it. I was my father\u2019s right-hand \u2018man\u2019 in those days,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThough I was much younger than my brothers, my father seemingly thought I had a better business head, so I had to look after the management side of the show \u2014 supervised by father, of course. I wasn\u2019t old enough \u2014 maybe I wasn\u2019t good enough \u2014 to play a part, but I went on and danced a Highland fling.\n\n\u201cBesides this I took the money at the door, helped father to change into his highland rigout, then after the show I had to settle up with the local manager or hallkeeper. Then I had to go round behind again and pack up my own and father\u2019s things.\u201d\n\nJohn made his first appearance as Rob Roy, at the Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh, and his final public appearance was at the King\u2019s Theatre in Edinburgh in the same part.\n\nHe brought his company to Helensburgh's Victoria Hall in 1911 with 'Jeanie Deans, or The Sisters of St Leonards', and the Helensburgh and Gareloch Times reported that the hall was well filled, which went to show that his annual visit to the town was as popular as ever.\n\nThe paper reported: \"The company was a very powerful one indeed, and Mr Clyde was very happy in the role of Laird of Dumbiedykes, showing a fine conception of the old Scottish language.\n\n\"The whole of this popular Scottish drama was played in four acts, and we were well pleased with this version of it. We may also say that Mr Clyde still ranks as one of our foremost actors. On the whole the play was a pronounced success, and will no doubt draw large audiences wherever it goes.\"\n\n\n\nAn obituary was published in the Helensburgh and Gareloch Times the week of his death in his 59th year. It read:\n\n\u201cEveryone in Helensburgh and thousands of lovers of the drama the world o\u2019er \u2014 particularly Scotch pieces \u2014 will learn with profound regret of the death of Mr John Clyde, actor-manager, which took place at the residence of his daughter, Mrs Watson, 34 John Street, on Monday night.\n\n\u201cDeceased had been in failing health for several weeks and, although he made an occasional rally, lately it was seen that the end was not far off.\n\n\u201cA native of Blairgowrie, Perthshire, he was a draper by profession. In early life he felt the fascination of the boards and, burning his boats, left trade behind. At once almost, he leaped to fame \u2014 he never played small parts \u2014 scoring splendidly as Rob Roy, his first part.\n\n\u201cOf powerful physique, and a brilliant delineator, he was considered the finest Rob Roy that Scotland has produced for half a century. Roderick Dhu is another favourite character, and in this too he shone.\n\n\u201cIndeed, for the long period of 33 years, he had been an outstanding figure on the Scottish stage. He represented what was best.\n\n\u201cHe frequently collaborated with Durward Lely, and together they did splendid work.\n\n\u201cAnd so, after a long, honourable, and praiseworthy record before the footlights, the curtain has been rung down. John Clyde, a big man in all the ways, has appeared before us for the last time.\n\n\u201cHe was twice married, and is survived by five of the family of his first wife. His son John was killed during the Great War. His second wife and a little girl also mourn his death. To them and the other relatives, the deepest sympathy is extended.\u201d\n\nThe funeral was private, and a legal notice the following week inviting any claims to be lodged described him as John Clyde, of 3 Rockhill Terrace, Dunoon, and latterly of 34 John Street, Helensburgh. Nothing is known of the reported second wife and the little girl \u2014 perhaps they lived at the Dunoon address.\n\nA report in the Scotsman in December 1920 states that the estate of the well-known actor-manager John Clyde was lodged with the Sheriff Clerk at Dumbarton and amounted to \u00a34,307 (roughly \u00a3125,000 today).\n\nHis brother, Rattray-born Robert McIntosh Clyde, set up the Clyde grocery business in Helensburgh, which had branches in West Princes Street and Sinclair Street, in 1892 and died at his home, Bramwell, West King Street, on Christmas Day 1947, some 26 years after he retired.\n\nTwo descendants of the Clyde family still living in the burgh are Lieutenant Commander Gill Aitkenhead MBE, Vice-Lieutenant of Dunbartonshire, and whisky executive Alistair Paton."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1496593", "page_content": "Bill Brown IV (born 1969 in San Diego , California ) is an American composer .\n\nBiography\n\nBill Brown began his career composing powerful scores for triple-A game titles, including Tom Clancy's 'Rainbow Six' and 'Ghost Recon', Clive Barker's 'Undying', 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein', 'Lineage II: The Chaotic Chronicle' and 'Command & Conquer: Generals'. Bill also contributed additional music to the hit films 'Any Given Sunday', 'Ali', and 'Finding Forrester', scored television films including 'Scorcher' (CineTel/HBO) and 'Trapped' (USA Network), and he is currently the composer for the hit CBS television series, CSI:NY.\n\nIn 1991, Bill graduated from Berklee College of Music with a degree that included study in jazz theory and composition, song writing, modern theory and orchestration and finally the art of film composition, a passion of his inspired years earlier hearing the scores of John Williams, Jerry Goldsmith, and John Barry. During his time in Boston, Bill found inspiration in the music of modern composers like Paul Hindemith, Shostakovich, Bartok, Pendereki and English composer Ralph Vaughn Williams, studying 20th century harmony, orchestration and techniques which would find their way into his orchestral compositions later. Bill's passion for electonics and sound design began with analog tape and programming classic synths back in the 80's and continues today with ever-evolving new technologies at the composer's LA studio. While at Berklee, Brown began to experiement with both song form, winning the Berklee Songwriter's contest in 1990, and more purely experimental approaches inspired by Steve Reich, John Adams, and the chromatisicm of Schoernberg, Berg, Harris and Ligeti writing music for small ensembles and electronics throughout and beyond his five years in Boston before moving back to New York, and eventually to Hollywood, CA.\n\nIn the past ten years, Bill has composed music in varying degrees for directors and producers including Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks Interactive (\"The Lost World: Trespasser\"), Oliver Stone (\"Any Given Sunday\"), Michael Mann (\"Ali\"), Clive Barker (\"Clive Barker's Undying\"), Michael Crichton (\"Timeline\"-VG), and writer/producer Tom Clancy on his hit game series \"Rainbow Six\" and \"Ghost Recon\". Building on the success of his scores for games, television and films, his music and career continue to expand into new territory.\n\nBill's scores have been nominated by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, L.A.

He averaged nearly 47 in Tests, and over fifty in first-class cricket, making 39 first-class hundreds. He would have undoubtedly played more Test cricket if it were not for the war. An unspectacular bat, he was a superb glancer, and deft placer of the ball. He had a full range of shots, however, and was hard to tie down.\n\nBrown's cricket career got off to a most inauspicious start when in his debut first-class innings for New South Wales in 1932 he was run out for a duck without facing a ball. He made a good impression in the Sheffield Shield, and to the surprise of some was picked to tour England in 1934. He had an outstanding tour; his 119 against Lancashire earned him a place in the first Test, where his second innings 73 helped Australia earn victory after Woodfull, Ponsford and Bradman had failed. He made his debut Test hundred in the second Test, as Australia experienced a rare loss at Lord's, and was promoted to open with Ponsford in the third Test where he made a useful 72. He failed in the final two Tests, but had proven himself as a Test player of class, ending up third in the Test averages.\n\nHe scored consistently on the 1935-36 tour of South Africa, with four fifties and a century in the five Tests, but was less successful in the two home Tests he played against England. 1936 saw him accept a coaching position in Brisbane and he represented Queensland from 1936-37. In 1937-38 he was appointed Queensland captain and by 1938 he was at the height of his ability, and stood out in a side marked by outstanding batsmen (Bradman, Fingleton, McCabe and Hassett). He made a century in the first Test after Australia had followed on, and he carried his bat for a superb unbeaten 206 at Lord's. He missed the third Test through injury, but was the top Australian scorer in either innings at the Oval Test so dominated by Hutton.\n\nDuring the war he served in the Pacific with the RAAF as a flight lieutenant. After the war he was not the dominating player he had been before, and he had lost possibly his most productive cricket years. He did captain Australia in their inaugural Test against New Zealand, presiding over a 2-day rout, and making the highest score of the match. In the final Test against India in 1947-48 he was most unluckily run out for 99, but was chosen to tour England with the \"Invincibles\" in 1948. He played in the first two Tests but then lost his place to Neil Harvey. He made eight centuries on that tour, but with the advent of fine young players like Morris and Harvey, he retired at the end of the following season after captaining the Australian second team to New Zealand. He was a Queensland selector from 1950-51 to 1959-60 and an Australian selector in 1952-53. In 1992 the Queensland Cricket Association elected him a life member.\n\nA likeable, popular and modest man was awarded Medal of the Order of Australia in 2000 for services to cricket. He died on March 16, 2008, aged 95, after being ill for a few months.\n\nDavid Liverman"}]}
