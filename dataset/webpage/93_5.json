His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n:... Wenxuan drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao (\u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f), personal name Zu'e (\u7956\u5a25)\n\n\u2022 Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao (\u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7; 545\u2013561), first son\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7; 548\u2013562), second son\n\n\u2022 Princess Changle (\u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b), personal name Baode (\u5bf6\u5fb7)\n\n\u2022 Married Wei Shibian (\u5c09\u4e16\u8faf)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yining (\u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yan clan (\u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang (\u7389\u5149)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi (\u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Pei clan (\u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1; d. 577), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Pin, of the Xue clan (\u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f; d. 555)\n\n\u2022 A daughter\n\n\u2022 Shifu, of the Feng clan (\u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang (\u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9; d. 580), third son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Princess Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei (\u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://www.nouahsark.com/en/infocenter/culture/history/monarchs/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi.php", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (529\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), was the first emperor of the Chinese dynasty northern qi. He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/china-history/the-southern-northern-dynasties.htm", "page_content": "The Longmen Grottoes. The Longmen Grottoes.\n\nPreceded by the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420) and followed by the Sui Dynasty (58-618), the Southern and Northern Dynasties lasted from 420 to 589, which was a time of turmoil and war, but it was also a time of prosperity for art, culture, religion and technology in the history of China.\n\nThe Southern Dynasties (420-589) refer to the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479), the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), the Liang Dynasty (502-557) and the Chen Dynasty (557-589); the Northern Dynasties (386-581) include the North Wei (386-557), the East Wei (534-550), the West Wei (535-556), the North Qi (550-577) and the North Zhou (557-581) dynasties.\n\nAlthough there were unceasing social disorders, frequent changes of dynasties and unexpected natural disasters, the Southern Dynasties (420-589) and the Northern Dynasties (386-581) remained in stalemate for over 100 years, and the historians called this period the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589).\n\nThe Southern Dynasties (420-589)\n\nChina was divided into South China and North China in 304, which confronted each other. Four dynasties stepped onto the historical stage successively in North China \u2014 the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479), the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), the Liang Dynasty (502-557) and the Chen Dynasty (557-589) \u2014 which were known as the Southern Dynasties (420-589) in Chinese history.\n\nAll of the four dynasties had their capitals in Jiangkang (presently Nanjing of Jiangsu Province), except that Emperor Yuan of the Liang Dynasty (502-557) had his capital at Jiangliang (presently Jiangling of Hubei Province) for three years.\n\nThe Southern Dynasties (420-589) was a changing period for the nobilities from prosperity to decline. Though the nobilities still enjoyed a very high social status in the Southern Dynasties (420-589), they couldn't completely control the political situation owing to the increasingly strengthened imperial power.\n\nWith the areas to the south of the Yangtze River becoming further developed, more and more Han people from the lower class stepped into the bureaucratic ranks and received the pleasure of the emperors during the Southern Dynasties (420-589).\n\nLiu Song\n\nAs the longest dynasty among the Southern Dynasties (420-589), the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) was founded by Liu Yu, a general of the Northern Garrison Army of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420), who came into power through suppressing Huan Xuan's rebellion in 404. He didn't even hesitate to lead two northern expeditions against North China just to gain prestige, during which he seized the territories of Henan, Shandong and Guanzhong (the lower valley of the Wei River).\n\nBy killing Emperor An (Sima Dezong) and deposing Emperor Gong (Sima Dewen) of the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420), Liu Yu crowned himself Emperor Wu of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) on July 10th of 420, thus ending the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317-420) and establishing the Southern Dynasties (420-589). Tuoba Gui of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) unified North China in 440, since the confrontation between North China and South China had begun.\n\nEmperor Wu was very frugal after ascending the throne, but he was not interested in royal education and trusted unworthy men, leading to a great disaster in his court. After realizing the imperial power was threatened by the nobilities, Emperor Wu started to promote humble clan landlords to higher official positions and gave military power to his kinsmen. Owing to his kinsmen often plotting to overthrow him, Emperor Wu was so terrified that he frequently had them killed.\n\nEmperor Wu abdicated the throne in favor of his son, Liu Song (later Emperor Shao), who was deposed and later killed by his men, Xu Xianzhi and Fu Liang, owing to his immoral behavior. The courtiers set up Liu Yilong (another son of Emperor Wu) as Emperor Wen of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479).\n\nEmperor Wen later had Xu Xianzhi and Fu Liang killed with the help of General Tan Daoji (a general of the Northern Garrison Army), and during his reign the political situation was rather stable owing to his cleansing of political corruption and advocating frugality; this period was known as the Yuanjia Administration in the history of China.\n\nEmperor Wen had launched several northern expeditions against the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) since 430, ending up with failure each time owing to insufficient preparations and inadequate commands, which had greatly weakened his kingdom. On the contrary, the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) crusaded against the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) and conquered the Yangtze River area in 445, following which the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) remained in a weakened state.\n\nEmperor Wen was murdered by the crown prince, Liu Shao, in 453. The third son of Emperor Wen, Liu Jun, killed Liu Shao, crowning himself as Emperor Xiaowu of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479), but he was very licentious and cruel and even raped his own niece, leading to his kinsmen's rebellion, and he slaughtered them all in Guangling (presently Yangzhou of Jiangsu Province).\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Xiaowu, Liu Ziye (later Emperor Qianfei of the Liu Song Dynasty) ascended the throne, ordering his own kinsmen to be killed which eventually resulted in his assassination by Liu Yu. After usurping the throne, Liu Yu crowned himself as Emperor Ming of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) and killed all the descendants of Emperor Xiaowu.\n\nAs the son of Emperor Ming, Liu Yu (later Emperor Houfei of the Liu Song Dynasty) ascended the throne and the military power fell into the hands of Xiao Daocheng. By deposing Emperor Houfei and setting up Liu Huai (the third son of Emperor Ming) as a puppet emperor, Xiao Daocheng arrogated all powers to himself.\n\nAfter crushing his political opponents, Yuan Can and Shen Youzhi, Xiao Daocheng deposed Liu Huai and crowned himself Emperor Gao of the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), symbolizing the demise of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479).\n\nSouthern Qi\n\nThe Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502) was established by Xiao Daocheng (later Emperor Gao) in 479, who was from the Xiao family of Lanling (presently Cangshan County, Shandong), and he was disdained by the nobilities owing to his previously lower social standing.\n\nLike the founding father of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479), Emperor Gao remained very frugal during his reign. He died after ruling for four years and was succeeded by his eldest son, Xiao Ze (later Emperor Wu of the Southern Qi Dynasty). Xiao Ze made a peace treaty with the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) and maintained security in his territory, and this peaceful period was known as the Yongming Administration in the history of China.\n\nEmperor Wu was succeeded by his grandson, Xiao Zhaoye, who was assisted by Xiao Luan in conducting state affairs. Xiao Luan usurped the throne by killing Xiao Zhaoye and Xiao Zhaowen (brother of Xiao Zhaoye), crowning himself Emperor Ming of the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), who also used government secretaries to monitor his kinsmen and had all the descendants of Emperors Gao and Wu killed.\n\nXiao Baojuan became emperor after the death of Emperor Ming, and he was so cruel and tyrannical that he even had his assisting ministers killed, sparking rebellions across his kingdom. Just as the saying goes, \"when all birds are shot, the bow will be set aside; when all hares are killed, the hounds will be stewed and eaten\u201d, Xiao Baojuan killed his meritorious general, Xiao Yi, after putting down a rebellion. Xiao Yan, brother of Xiao Yi, rose in revolt against Xiao Baojuan to avenge his brother in 501.\n\nAfter Xiao Yan's conquering of Jiankang (presently Nanjing of Jiangsu Province), Xiao Baojuan was murdered by his general, Wang Zhenguo. Xiao Yan usurped the throne and crowned himself as Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty (502-557) in 502, thus ending the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502).\n\nLiang Dynasty\n\nThe Liang Dynasty (502-557) was established by Xiao Yan (Emperor Wu) in 502, and he was economical, diligent in government affairs and cared for the common people, which enabled his military strength to surpass that of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) during his reign. Unlike the emperors of the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty (502-557) was very lenient to his kinsmen.\n\nAs a very learned emperor, Emperor Wu advocated cultural exchanges among scholars, who greatly promoted the cultural prosperity of the Liang Dynasty (502-557), but he lent a willing ear to flattery and praise from treacherous court officials during his later years. He even tried to become a monk in Tongtai Temple three times owing to his obsession with Buddhism, but he was persuaded to return to his kingdom each time by abbots, and he donated a large sum of money to the temple.\n\nDuring Emperor Wu's reign, nearly half of the population became monks in respect of the fact that the Buddhists and Taoists were exempt from taxes according to laws, which caused great damage to the Liang Dynasty (502-557).\n\nThe Liang Dynasty (502-557) was at war with the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) near the southern part of Huai River and won it in 503, and the former also defeated the latter in the battle of Shouyang in 516. Emperor Wu was willing to accept the surrendered generals from the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) in order to reap where he had not sowed.\n\nAs the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) was rent into the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) and the East Wei Dynasty (534-550), Emperor Wu gave shelter to Hou Jing (the rebellious East Wei general) and sent him to crusade against the East Wei Dynasty (534-550).\n\nAfter the Liang army led by Hou Jing was defeated, Emperor Wu was to sacrifice Hou Jing as a peace offering. Hearing the news, Hou Jing rose in revolt against Emperor Wu and conquered Jiankang (presently Nanjing), and Emperor Wu fled to Taicheng.\n\nHou Jing ordered the slaughter of the nobilities after capturing Jiankang, dealing a crushing blow to the Liang Dynasty (502-557), and it turned out that Emperor Wu was starved to death. Hou Jing made Xiao Gang (the eldest son of Emperor Wu) a puppet emperor and took his place later, and he even established the Han State. Later, Chen Baxian, the governor of Guangzhou, collaborated with Wang Sengbian, a general under the command of Xiao Yi (governor of Jiangling), to crusade against Hou Jing and had him killed.\n\nXiao Yi succeeded to the throne and crowned himself Emperor Yuan of the Liang Dynasty (502-557). Xiao Cha guided the East Wei army to attack Jiangling and killed Emperor Yuan the following year, and he was made a puppet emperor of the West Liang Dynasty (502-557).\n\nAfter Emperor Yuan was killed, Chen Baxian and Wang Sengbian set up Xiao Fangzhi (son of Emperor Yuan) as Emperor Jing. The Liang army retreated in defeat again and again during the wars with the North Qi Dynasty (550-577), and Wang Sengbian was forced to depose Emperor Jing and to set up Xiao Yuanming (backed up by the North Qi Dynasty) as emperor, under great pressure from the North Qi Dynasty (550-577).\n\nOut of great dissatisfaction with Wang Sengbian's decision, Chen Baxian led his army to attack Wang Sengbian and had him killed, and he deposed Xiao Yuanming and re-established Xiao Fangzhi as Emperor Jing. Chen Baxian usurped the throne and established the Chen Dynasty (557-589) in 557, claiming the title of Emperor Wu of the Chen Dynasty (557-589), thus ending the Liang Dynasty (502-557).\n\nChen Dynasty\n\nThe Chen Dynasty (557-589) was established by Chen Baxian in 557, who was from Wu (presently Shanghai). Owing to the Wu and Qiao clans being greatly weakened during the Hou Jing Rebellion, a number of independent regimes emerged in South China after the wars. Chen Baxian (Emperor Wu of the Cheng Dynasty) adopted a pacifying policy to these regimes due to his limited military power.\n\nChen Qian, the nephew of Emperor Wu, succeeded to the throne and became Emperor Wen after the death of Emperor Wu. As the Liang Dynasty (502-557) fell, Wang Lin established a kingdom in Lianghu (presently Hubei and Hunan Provinces) and, allied with the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) and the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) to attack Jiankang, ended up with being defeated by the Chen army. Emperor Wen made every effort to make his kingdom prosperous during his reign, greatly improving the economic situation in South China.\n\nAfter Emperor Wen died, the crown prince Chen Bozong (later Emperor Fei) ascended to the throne, and he was deposed by his own uncle, Chen Wangxu, who claimed himself Emperor Xu of the Chen Dynasty (557-589). The North Wei Dynasty (386-557) intended to invade the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) and invited the Chen Dynasty (557-589) to assist with the attack. Emperor Xuan accepted the offer and sent General Wu Mingche to assist the cause in 573, recovering the lost territory in the southern area of the Huai River two years later.\n\nAfter the fall of the North Qi Dynasty (550-577), the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) crusaded against the Chen Dynasty and defeated it in 577, leaving it in a precarious situation. All of a sudden, Emperor Wu of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) died, which stopped the southern advance of the North Zhou Dynasty's (557-581) army. The death of Emperor Wu also resulted in internal strife, and Yang Jian took the opportunity and seized the throne, establishing the Sui Dynasty.\n\nAfter the death of Emperor Xuan, Chen Baoshu ascended the throne as Emperor Houzhu of the Chen Dynasty (557-589), who was very licentious and wasteful during his reign, leading to chaos and corruption in his kingdom. The Sui troops burned the farmlands of the Chen Dynasty (557-589) during the harvest time, which greatly weakened the strength of the Chen Dynasty (557-589).\n\nEmperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty (581-618) sent his son, Yang Guang (later Emperor Yang), to launch a war against the Chen Dynasty (557-589) in 588. Chen Shubao continued to live a licentious life with his concubines owing to relying on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, and the Sui army seized Jiankang and captured Chen Shubao, leading to the fall of the Chen Dynasty (557-589).\n\nThe Northern Dynasties (386-581)\n\nConfronting the Southern Dynasties (420-589) in the history of China, the Northern Dynasties (386-581) lasted for 150 years (from 439 to 589), and consisted of the North Wei (386-557), the East Wei (534-550), the West Wei (535-556), the North Qi (550-577) and the North Zhou (557-581) dynasties.\n\nAll the Northern Dynasties (386-581) were established by the Xianbei people except for the North Qi Dynasty (this was established by the Sinicized barbarians).\n\nNorth Wei\n\nThe Longmen Grottoes were started to buit. The Longmen Grottoes were started to buit.\n\nWith the state of Dai as its predecessor during the Sixteen Kingdom Period, the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) was established by Tuoba Gui in 386, who became Emperor Daowu later. Emperor Daowu was very cruel and was murdered by his own son, Tuoba Shao.\n\nTuoba Si (Tuoba Gui's eldest son) ascended the throne as Emperor Mingyuan of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) in 387. He conquered Henan of the Liu Song Dynasty (420-479) and died soon afterwards, and he was succeeded by his son, Tuoba Tao (later Emperor Taiwu).\n\nTuoba Tao made every effort to improve his kingdom, greatly increasing the strength of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557). He ordered attacks on the Liu Song Dynasty repeatedly and also launched a series of wars against the North Liang Dynasty (401-439), Rouran and Shanshan (a state in the West Region), and he even proscribed Buddhism after suppressing the Gai Wu (Buddhist follower) Rebellion. He carried out cruel punishments in his later life, leading to his assassination by the eunuch, Zong Ai, in 452.\n\nAfter Emperor Taiwu's death, the Empress Dou held court from behind a screen, and she set up Tuoba Yuanhong as Emperor Xiaowen of the North Wei Dynasty (386-557). Greatly influenced by his mother (Empress Dou, a Han woman), the Emperor Xiaowen thought that the Xianbei people should be Sinicized owing to the advanced Han civilization. He moved the capital from Pingcheng to Luoyang to learn the Han culture, and even ordered Xianbei nobles to move into Luoyang, leaving some (who didn't want to move) in Pingcheng.\n\nEmperor Xiaowen carried out a series of social reforms aimed at enabling the Xiaobei nobles to conform to the Han cultural standards, including adopting the Han bureaucratic establishments, banning Xianbei costumes and advocating donning the Han costume at court, learning the Han language, encouraging the inter-marriage between Xianbei people and the Han people, and adopting a one-character Chinese surname among the Xianbei people, which greatly improved national reunification in his kingdom.\n\nAfter the Sinicization movement, the economic and military strength was greatly improved in the North Wei Dynasty (386-557). Emperor Xiaowen also launched a series of wars against the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502), but ended up with failure each time. The nobles who didn't want to move into Luoyang gradually lost favor in the sight of Emperor Xiaowen, resulting in a split in the North Wei Dynasty (386-557).\n\nTuoba Yuanxiu succeeded to the throne as Emperor Xiaowu of the North Wei Dynasty in 532, and the North Wei Dynasty was split into the East Wei (534-550) and the West Wei (535-556) dynasties in 534 owing to internal strife among nobles.\n\nConfrontation between the East Wei and the West Wei\n\nThe East Wei Dynasty (534-550) was established by Tuoba Shanjian (later Emperor Xiaojing) in 534 with Yecheng (presently Anyang of Henan and Linzhang Counties of Hebei Province) as the capital, and the East Wei Dynasty (534-550) was set up by Tuoba Baoju (later Emperor Wen) in 535 with Chang'an (presently Xi'an of Shaanxi Province) as the capital. As a matter of fact, the power of the East Wei (534-550) and the West Wei (535-556) dynasties were wielded by Gao Huan and Yu Wentai respectively, and a series of wars resulted in a stalemate between the two states.\n\nThe East Wei Dynasty (534-550) was dominated by the Sinicized Xianbei people, who highly relied on Xianbei nobility politically. Gao Huan advocated the personnel policy of \"only using the talented\", so many famous court officials became his friends. Gao Huan ordered General Dou Tai to crusade against the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) in 536, but ended up with being defeated by the East Wei Dynasty's (534-550) troops, and Dou Tai killed himself out of shame.\n\nAs the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) was visited by a great drought in 538, Gao Han seized the chance to attack the West Wei Dynasty (535-556), and ended up with failure in the battle of Shayuan. He led 100,000 troops to attack the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) in 546, but he lost the war for the third time, leaving over 70,000 soldiers dead and wounded.\n\nGao Huan was consumed with great grief in 548, and his son, Gao Cheng, inherited his title. Gao Cheng was assassinated soon afterwards; his brother, Gao Yang, inherited his title and killed Emperor Xiaojing and the royal members in 550. Gao Yang established the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) in 550, claiming himself to be Emperor Wenxuan of the North Qi Dynasty.\n\nUnder the assistance of eight generals (Yu Wentai, Yuan Xin, Li Hu, Li Bi, Zhao Gui, Yu Jin, Du Guxin and Houmo Chenchong), the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) effectively resisted a series of attacks from the East Wei Dynasty (534-550). At that time, the economy and culture of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) was not as prosperous as that of the East Wei Dynasty (534-550), and Yu Wentai ordered Su Chuo to make reforms in order to strengthen the nation.\n\nThe reforms, such as setting up the Fubing System (a local militia system existing in China between 6th century and 8th century) and advocating militarism, greatly enhanced the military strength of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556), which also had a great influence on the political and military systems of the Sui (581-618) and the Tang dynasties (618-907).\n\nDuring the Hou Jing Rebellion, Yu Wentai seized the opportunity to attack the Liang Dynasty (502-557) and captured Shu (presently Sichuan Province) and Jiangling (presently Jiangling of Hubei Province). After the death of Yu Wentai, Yu Wenhu (Yu Wentai's nephew) arrogated all powers of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556) to himself in 556, and deposed Emperor Gong and set up Yu Wenjue (son of Yu Wentai) as Emperor Xiaomin of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) in 558, symbolizing the demise of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556).\n\nConfrontation between the North Qi and the North Zhou (557-581)\n\nAs the successor of the East Wei Dynasty (534-550), the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) was established by Gao Yang (Emperor Wenxuan) in 550. Emperor Wenxuan defeated the Kumoxi people, the Qidan people, the Rouran people and the Shanhu people (a branch of the Huns) one after another; he even conquered the territorial area to the south of the Hurai River, and great progress was made in agriculture, salt and iron trade, and porcelain trade during his early reign.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan became licentious and cruel during his late reign, even ordering the slaughter of the Han nobilities in favor of the Xianbei nobilities, and the common people rebelled against him owing to his oppression, greatly reducing the strength of the North Qi Dynasty (550-577). Gao Yin ascended the throne as Emperor Fei of the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) after the death of Emperor Wenxuan, and he was assisted by his uncle, Gao Yan.\n\nGao Yan soon usurped the throne and became Emperor Xiaozhao of the North Qi Dynasty (550-577), during whose reign the national strength was restored gradually, and he died during the 2nd year of his reign and was succeeded by his brother, Gao Zhan (later Emperor Wucheng).\n\nEmperor Wucheng was very unprincipled and licentious; he died of excessive indulgence in sex and he was soon succeeded by his son, Gao Wei. As the old saying goes, \"like father, like son\u201d. Gao Wei was also unprincipled and licentious; he even had General Hulu Guang killed out of jealousy, resulting in great chaos in his kingdom, and the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) was conquered by the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) in 577.\n\nAs the successor of the West Wei Dynasty (535-556), the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) was established by Yu Wenjue (Emperor Xiaomin) in 550, but the political power was wielded by his cousin, Yu Wenhu. Emperor Xiaomin intended to ally with Zhao Gui and Gu Duji to kill Yu Wenhu, but their scheme was soon discovered.\n\nYu Wenhu had Emperor Xiaomin deposed and had Zhao Gui and Gu Duji beheaded after a fierce battle, and he set up Yu Wenyu as Emperor Ming of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581) and poisoned him in 560. Later, Yu Wenhu set up Yu Wenyong as Emperor Wu of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581). By adopting a stratagem of concealing his true intentions, Emperor Wu successfully had Yu Wenhu killed after being used as a puppet for 12 years, and he came into real power of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581).\n\nEmperor Wu had great talent and bold vision, carrying out a series of reforms during his reign, which greatly reinforced the strength of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581). Emperor Wu even conquered the North Qi Dynasty (550-577) in 577, and he was succeeded by his eldest son, Yu Wenyun (later Emperor Xuan of the North Zhou Dynasty), in 578. Emperor Xuan was very tyrannical and licentious, and even killed Yu Wenxuan (an official with meritorious records) and took away his wife. Emperor Xuan was succeeded by his son, Yu Wenchan (later Emperor Jing of the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581). Emperor Jing was deposed by Yang Jian in 581, thus ending the North Zhou Dynasty (557-581).\n\nReligion\n\nYungang Grottoes Yungang Grottoes\n\nA number of outstanding Taoist reformers emerged during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), represented by Kou Qianzhi, Lu Jingxiu and Tao Hongjing, under whose efforts Taoism took a new look.\n\nKou Qianzhi made the highest achievement among the three reformers, and he simplified some Taoist fast rites and recruited royal members and nobilities to take part in Taoism, which greatly alleviated class contradictions in the society and had landmark significance in the development of Taoism.\n\nBuddhism was very popular in the North Wei Dynasty (386-557) during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), which greatly boosted the development of Buddhist statues, murals and grottoes, highlighted by the Thousand Buddha Caves (in Dunhuang of Gansu Province), the Yungang Grottoes (in Datong of Shanxi Province), the Maijishan Grottoes (in Tianshui of Gansu Province) and the Longmen Grottoes (in Luoyang of Henan Province).\n\nArt\n\nGreat progress was made in art during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589), which was represented by paintings in the Southern Dynasties (420-589) and stone carvings in the Northern Dynasties (386-581).\n\nThe theory of painting was established in the Southern Dynasties (420-589). Xie He proposed six methods to appreciating paintings in his works, Hua Pin, of which the rhythmic vitality was considered the highest standard of painting appreciation.\n\nThe stone carvings of the Northern Dynasties (386-581) were represented by grottoes, painted sculptures and mausoleum sculptures. The Yungang Grottoes feature Buddhist statues with calm and solemn looks, the painted sculptures of the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang are characterized by significant smiles, and the clay sculptures of Yongning Temple (in Luoyang of Henan Province) feature vividness and delicateness.\n\nThe imperial mausoleums of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589) were decorated with stone pillars, steles and stone beasts, which created a solemn atmosphere on the whole, highlighted by the mausoleums of Emperor Wu and Emperor Jing of the Southern Qi Dynasty (479-502)."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Emperor_Wenxuan_of_Northern_Qi", "page_content": "What we do.

He was the second son of the Eastern Wei's paramount general Gao Huan. Following the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor an eldest son Gao Cheng in 549, Gao Yang became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced the Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending the Eastern Wei dynasty and starting the Northern Qi dynasty.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. In his later years, Emperor Wenxuan suffered from alcoholism and possibly insanity.[5] Chinese historical annals recorded his bloody rages. Nevertheless, his reign, with assistance from his advisers, was considered well-administered and effective.[6]\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 814 22 901 7 988 14 612 4 584\n\nHow Terrible Was Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi (526\u2013559)? #shorts\n\nHistory of Northern Dynasties (China) : Every Year (Map in Chinese Version)\n\nThe Ruthless Rulers of Ancient China\n\nRise of the Gokturks VI: From Huns to Chinese - Turco-Mongols in Northern China\n\n\u5357\u5317\u671d: \u4e09\u767e\u5e74\u4e82\u4e16\u7684\u6700\u7d42\u7ae0 | TWILIGHT SAY \u5fae\u660e\u8aaa (2022) Transcription\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 526, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was from a wealthy Xianbei family.[7] He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan (\u592a\u539f\u516c).\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children, though it appears that he feigned this to prevent suspicion of his elder brother. It appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 8000 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\nEarly reign\n\nNorthern Qi shieldbearer\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nJust like his father Gao Huan, Emperor Wenxuan viewed himself as more of a Xianbei rather than Chinese. Further, more than his father did, he was not willing to follow most of the Chinese traditions. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo Yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (known in history as the Western Liang), but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, which he converted into a fiddle, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian:\n\n... [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, his mother Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how she had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners and a saw to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Zhan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. In particular, a man named Yuan Huangtou flown off a tower strapped to a kite as part of an experiment of Emperor Wenxuan, the first known case of human flight. He survived but was starved to death in prison. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin. Not long after, Gao Yan killed Yang Yin and deposed Gao Yin, becoming emperor.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nIn the Book of Northern Qi, author Li Baiyao notes that Gao Yang was a dark-skinned man with large and protruding jaws, and that his skin appeared to be abnormally rough.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\nEmpress Zhaoxin, of the Li clan of Zhao ( \u662d\u4fe1\u7687\u540e \u8d99\u90e1\u674e\u6c0f ), personal name Zu'e ( \u7956\u5a25 ) Gao Yin, Prince Jinan Mindao ( \u6fdf\u5357\u610d\u60bc\u738b \u9ad8\u6bb7 ; 545\u2013561), first son Gao Shaode, Prince Taiyuan ( \u592a\u539f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5fb7 ; 548\u2013562), second son Princess Changle ( \u9577\u6a02\u516c\u4e3b ), personal name Baode ( \u5bf6\u5fb7 ) Married Wei Shibian ( \u5c09\u4e16\u8faf ) Princess Yining ( \u7fa9\u5be7\u516c\u4e3b ) Married Hul\u00fc Wudu ( \u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd ; d. 572), the first son of Hul\u00fc Guang\n\n), personal name Zu'e ( ) Furen , of the Yan clan ( \u5f18\u5fb7\u592b\u4eba \u984f\u6c0f ; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang ( \u7389\u5149 ) Gao Shaolian, Prince Longxi ( \u96b4\u897f\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u5ec9 ; 553\u2013577), fifth son\n\n, of the Yan clan ( ; 530\u2013576), personal name Yuguang ( ) Pin , of the Pei clan ( \u5b2a \u88f4\u6c0f ) Gao Shaoren, Prince Xihe ( \u897f\u6cb3\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u4ec1 ; d. 577), fourth son\n\n, of the Pei clan ( ) Pin , of the Xue clan ( \u5b2a \u859b\u6c0f ; d. 555) A daughter\n\n, of the Xue clan ( ; d. 555) Shifu , of the Feng clan ( \u4e16\u5a66 \u99ae\u6c0f ) Gao Shaoyi, Prince Fanyang ( \u8303\u967d\u738b \u9ad8\u7d39\u7fa9 ; d. 580), third son\n\n, of the Feng clan ( ) Unknown Princess Zhongshan ( \u4e2d\u5c71\u516c\u4e3b ) Married Duan Baoding of Wuwei ( \u6b66\u5a01 \u6bb5\u5bf6\u9f0e )\n\n\n\nAncestry\n\nGao Hu Gao Mi (428\u2013472) Lady Murong Gao Shusheng (472\u2013526) Shusun Chong Lady Shusun of Henan Gao Huan (496\u2013547) Empress Wenmu (d. 496) Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi (526\u2013559) Lou Ti Lou Neigan Empress Wuming (501\u2013562)\n\nNotes\n\n^ Although both Book of Northern Qi and History of Northern Dynasties said Emperor Wenxuan died at 30, History of Northern Dynasties also said that Emperor Wenxuan was born at a Year of the Horse, intending his birth year was 526 rather than 529 which was a Year of the Rooster; Book of Northern Qi also mentioned that when Gao Yang was in infancy, Gao Huan was so poor that he and his relatives would suffer cold and hunger, but around 529 Gao Huan had already been the prefect of Jin thus could not still stay poor. So the birth year of Gao Yang should be 526, not 529.\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nSources"}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/emperor_wenxuan_of_northern_qi/late_reign", "page_content": "Late Reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor.

He was the second son of Eastern Wei 's paramount general Gao Huan , and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of Eastern Wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the Northern Qi military was at his prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin , and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\nEarly life\n\nGao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a general under Northern Wei 's paramount general Erzhu Rong . His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng . After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became Northern Wei's paramount general, and after Northern Wei divided into Eastern Wei and Western Wei in 534 became the actual power controlling Eastern Wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well-regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of Eastern Wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent . He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan , Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin , to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent\n\nInitially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan , Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival Liang Dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former Eastern Wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong , Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and establishing Northern Qi , with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager .\n\nEarly reign\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised Eastern Wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress . Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince .\n\nIn response to the establishment of Northern Qi, Yuwen Tai , the paramount general of rival Western Wei, launched a major attack on Northern Qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead.\" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to Northern Qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian , whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou , Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu , Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang , Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a great wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou , Shanxi ), apparently to defend against Western Wei and Tujue .\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking Northern Qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan -- and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put Northern Qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to Eastern Wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, Northern Qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran , which by that point was near its end, surrendered to Northern Qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within Northern Qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou , Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the \" History of Northern Dynasties \", and Sima Guang , the author of the \" Zizhi Tongjian \", saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule -- that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality -- and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former Northern Wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became Eastern Wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later -- and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of Northern Wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (\" Book of Wei \") was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as \"Huishu\" (\u7a62\u66f8 -- the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou , Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack Western Wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan , Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and Western Wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\nLate reign\n\nWestern Wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang , declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom Eastern Wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against Eastern Wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after Northern Qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between Northern Qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang , Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated Northern Qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to Northern Qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to Northern Qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed.)\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within Northern Qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between Northern Qi and Liang resumed, and Northern Qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of Northern Wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emepror Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his \"Zizhi Tongjian\":\n\n:\"... [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Soemtimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. he often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. ... Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven.\" He beheaded her.\"\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards -- if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty , and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin , then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested Northern Qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, Northern Qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a Northern Qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan , Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unahppy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne.\" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\nEra name\n\n* \"Tianbao\" (\u5929\u4fdd ti\u0101n b\u01ceo) 550-559\n\nPersonal information"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Ch%C3%A9n-B%C3%A0xi%C4%81n-%E9%99%B3%E9%9C%B8%E5%85%88-Emperor-Wu-of-Chen-%E9%99%B3%E6%AD%A6%E5%B8%9D-106-98-65-18-2%E4%B8%96/6000000003175651265", "page_content": "About Ch\u00e9n B\u00e0xi\u0101n \u9673\u9738\u5148, Emperor Wu of Chen \u9673\u6b66\u5e1d, 106, 98, 65, 18, 2\u4e16\n\nHistory of Chen Dynasty\n\nhttp://knows.jongo.com/res/article/4360\n\nHistory of Chen (557-589)\n\nCapital\uff1aJiankang\uff08\u5efa\u5eb7\uff09\u2013 present-day Nanjing of Jiangsu province\n\nAfter forcing the last Liang emperor to hand over (chanrang \u7985\u8ba9) to him the heavenly mandate (tianming \u5929\u547d), Chen Baxian\u9648\u9738\u5148 (posthumously \u2013 Chen Wudi \u9648\u6b66\u5e1d) inherited the imperial throne as Prince of Chen \u9648.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Northern Wei \u5317\u9b4f Empire, there was a new time of political unrest and military activity in the north and along the borders of Southern China. During the disturbances in the last decade of Liang, the northern empire \u2013 Northern Zhou \u5317\u5468 \u2013 conquered the whole western part of Southern China, that is modern Sichuan and Yunnan. Chen Baxian\u2019s empire was only half the size of that of the Liang dynasty. Furthermore, Chen Baxian was never able to fully control all territories of his empire as well as the political and military activities of the local gentry. It took him a long time to subdue all claimants to the throne from the Xiao family that had survived the claim to power of the Chen clan.\n\nThe most powerful person in the Chen empire after Chen Baxian\u2019s death was Hou Andu \u4faf\u5b89\u90fd who replaced the new emperor Chen Chang \u9648\u660c immediately with Chen Qian \u9648\u5029 (posthumously \u2013 Chen Wendi \u9648\u6587\u5e1d). Chen Qian\u2019s son Chen Bozong \u9648\u4f2f\u5b97 (posthumously \u2013 Chen Feidi \u9648\u5e9f\u5e1d\uff0cThe Deposed Emperor) was toppled by his own uncle Chen Xu \u9648\u987c (posthumously \u2013 Chen Xuandi \u9648\u5ba3\u5e1d). Chen Xu\u2019s reign was a relatively calm and peaceful period, except for the few unsuccessful military campaigns of Wu Mingche \u5434\u660e\u5f7b against the North.\n\nMeanwhile, at the northern frontier a serious change had taken place. The Northern Zhou empire \u5317\u5468 had conquered the neighboring state, Northern Qi \u5317\u9f50 and now controlled Northern and Western China. Thereupon Northern Zhou was destroyed by general Yang Jian \u6768\u575a who founded the Sui Dynasty \u968b. He then conquered the small state of Chen in the south and reunited China under his rule.\n\nFrom\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wu_of_Chen\n\nEmperor Wu of Chen (\u9673\u6b66\u5e1d) (503-559), personal name Chen Baxian (\u9673\u9738\u5148), courtesy name Xingguo (\u8208\u570b), nickname Fasheng (\u6cd5\u751f), was the first emperor of the Chinese Chen Dynasty. He first distinguished himself as a Liang Dynasty general during the campaign against the rebel general Hou Jing, and he was progressively promoted. In 555, he seized power after a coup against his superior, the general Wang Sengbian, and in 557 he forced Emperor Jing to yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty. He died in 559, and as his only surviving son Chen Chang was held by Northern Zhou as a hostage, he was succeeded by his nephew Chen Qian (Emperor Wen).\n\nBackground and early career\n\nChen Baxian was born in 503, the second year of the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang (the founding emperor of Liang Dynasty). He was from Wuxing Commandery (\u5433\u8208, roughly modern Huzhou, Zhejiang). His family traced its ancestry to Chen Shi (\u9673\u5bd4), a county magistrate and Confucian scholar during Han Dynasty. During the lineage that was traced, Chen's ancestors generally served as low-level officials, although several were important figures in imperial governments of Jin Dynasty and the subsequent Southern dynasties, including Chen Baxian's grandfather Chen Daoju (\u9673\u9053\u5de8). However, no record indicated that Chen Baxian's father Chen Wenzan (\u9673\u6587\u8b9a) was an official. His mother was a Lady Dong, probably Chen Wenzan's wife.\n\nWhen Chen Baxian was young, he was considered ambitious, not caring about managing properties. As he grew, he studied military strategies and learned various fighting techniques. Initially, he married a daughter of Qian Zhongfang (\u9322\u4ef2\u65b9), who was also from Wuxing Commandery, but she died early. After Lady Qian's death, he married Zhang Yao'er, likewise from Wuxing Commandery. She bore him at least one son, Chen Chang. (It is known that he had five sons before Chen Chang, but all, including Chen Ke (\u9673\u514b), the only one whose name is preserved in history, appeared to have died early; it is not known who were their mothers.)\n\nIn the late 530s, when Xiao Ying (\u856d\u6620) the Marquess of Xinyu, a nephew of Emperor Wu, was the governor of Wuxing Commandery, he had the chance to see Chen Baxian and was impressed by him. When Xiao Ying was made the governor of Guang Province (\u5ee3\u5dde, modern Guangdong) around 540, he invited Chen to serve on his staff, and subsequently, Xiao Ying made him an acting commandery governor.\n\nIn 541, the people of Jiao Province (\u4ea4\u5dde, modern northern Vietnam), dissatisfied with the cruel rule of Xiao Zi (\u856d\u8aee) the Marquess of Wulin (another nephew of Emperor Wu), rebelled under the leadership of Li Ben. Xiao Zi fled to Guang Province. Xiao Ying sent the generals Sun Jiong (\u5b6b\u518f) and Lu Zixiong (\u76e7\u5b50\u96c4) to attack Li, with Xiao Ying overseeing the operations. In spring 542, Xiao Ying and Xiao Zi ordered Sun and Lu to attack, despite Sun and Lu's request to delay the attack to fall 542 due to fears that hot temperature could cause illnesses. Li crushed their forces with heavy casualties, and Xiao Zi falsely accused Sun and Lu of working in concern with Li, and Emperor Wu ordered Sun and Lu to commit suicide. Lu Zixiong's brothers Lu Zil\u00fce (\u76e7\u5b50\u7565) and Lu Zilie (\u76e7\u5b50\u70c8) and subordinates, the brothers Du Tianhe (\u675c\u5929\u5408) and Du Sengming (\u675c\u50e7\u660e) and Zhou Wenyu (\u5468\u6587\u80b2) attacked the capital of Guang Province, wanting to kill Xiao Zi and Xiao Ying to avenge Lu Zixiong. Xiao Ying ordered Chen to engage them, and he defeated them, killing Du Tianhe and capturing Du Sengming and Zhou. Believing that Du Sengming and Zhou were both good soldiers, he released them and retained them on his staff. For this accomplishment, Emperor Wu created Chen the Viscount of Xin'an, and while he did not summon Chen to the capital Jiankang, he had an artisan draw a portrait of Chen and deliver it to him.\n\nIn winter 544, Xiao Ying died, and initially, Chen started escorting Xiao Ying's casket back to Jiankang for burial. On the way, while he was still at Dayu Mountain (\u5927\u5ebe\u5dba, on the borders of modern Jiangxi and Guangdong), he was ordered to rendezvous with the new governor of Jiao Province, Yang Piao (\u694a\u779f), and another nephew of Emperor Wu's, Xiao Bo (\u856d\u52c3), to attack Li. Xiao Bao did not want to set out on the campaign, and therefore try to persuade Yang not to advance. Chen persuaded Yang otherwise, and in spring 545, Yang, with Chen as his lieutenant, attacked Li, defeating him and forcing him flee into the mountains and conduct guerilla warfare instead. In 548, Li's subordinates killed Li, and when Li's brother Li Tianbao succeeded him and attacked Ai Province (\u611b\u5dde, centering modern Thanh H\u00f3a), Chen defeated Li Tianbao. Emperor Wu made Chen the governor of Gaoyao Commandery (\u9ad8\u8981, roughtly modern Zhaoqing, Guangdong) as well as the commander of the forces of the surrounding commanderies.\n\n[edit] During the Hou Jing Disturbance\n\nIn summer 548, the general Hou Jing, formerly an Eastern Wei (a branch successor state of Northern Wei) general that Emperor Wu had accepted the defection of, rebelled, and in 549 captured Jiankang, taking Emperor Wu and his son and crown prince Xiao Gang hostage. After Jiankang's fall, Hou, who had initially claimed that he wanted to restore Northern Wei's imperial clan to power, from the control of the regent Gao Cheng, enticed the governor of Guang Province, Yuan Jingzhong (\u5143\u666f\u4ef2), a member of Northern Wei's imperial Yuan clan, to join him, and when Chen received the news, he publicly announced Yuan's treachery and gathered the troops of the nearby generals to attack Yuan. Yuan committed suicide, and Chen welcomed Xiao Bo, then the governor of Ding Province (\u5b9a\u5dde, roughly modern Guigang, Guangxi) to take over Guang Province. In winter 549, against Xiao Bo's request, Chen took his troops and embarked on a campaign to join the fight against Hou, sending messengers to Emperor Wu's son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, the governor of Jing Province (\u834a\u5dde, modern central and western Hubei), pledging support and loyalty to Xiao Yi, then commonly viewed as the leader of the remaining Liang provinces not under Hou's control.\n\nFor the next year, Chen advanced north through modern Jiangxi, fighting the various local warlords and generals loyal to Hou, with his main struggle against Li Qianshi (\u674e\u9077\u4ed5). In spring 551, he captured and killed Li. Xiao Yi made him the governor of Jiang Province (\u6c5f\u5dde, roughly modern Jiangxi). By fall 551, he had rendezvoused with Xiao Yi's main general, Wang Sengbian, at Xunyang (\u5c0b\u967d, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi). In 552, after they had sworn a solemn oath to Liang, they advanced east toward Jiankang, where Hou had killed Xiao Gang (who had succeeded Emperor Wu as Emperor Jianwen) and taken the throne himself as Emperor of Han. Chen was instrumental in the subsequent siege of Jiankang, and they defeated Hou together, causing Hou to flee. Subsequently, Hou was killed by his own men. For Chen's contributions, Xiao Yi created Chen the Marquess of Changcheng -- Chen's home county. Wang put Chen in charge of the important city Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). For the next two years, Chen was several times involved in border battles against Northern Qi (Eastern Wei's successor state). At times, when Xiao Yi (who had by now taken the throne as Emperor Yuan but set up his capital at his headquarters of Jiangling rather than at Jiankang) summoned Wang on campaigns, Wang would put Chen in charge of Jiankang.\n\n[edit] Seizure of power\n\nIn 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Jiangling, and Emperor Yuan summoned Wang to come to his aid, putting Chen in charge of Jiankang. Before Wang could reach Jiangling, however, Western Wei had already captured Jiangling, killing Emperor Yuan and declaring his nephew Xiao Cha emperor instead (as Emperor Xuan). Wang and Chen refused to recognize Emperor Xuan; instead, in spring 555, they welcomed Emperor Yuan's 11-year-old son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an -- Emperor Yuan's only surviving son -- to Jiankang, preparing to make him emperor and first having him take the title Prince of Liang. (When Jiankang fell, Chen's son Chen Chang and nephew Chen Xu, who had been serving in the imperial administration, were captured and taken to the Western Wei capital Chang'an as honored captives.)\n\nAt this time, however, Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi had other ideas, and he sent his brother Gao Huan (\u9ad8\u6e19) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang -- whom Eastern Wei had taken captive in 547 -- back to Liang to be emperor. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after his forces lost a few battles to Northern Qi forces, changed his mind and decided to accept Xiao Yuanming as emperor after extracting a promise from Xiao Yuanming to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. In summer 555, Xiao Yuanming arrived at Jiankang to take the throne, and he created Xiao Fangzhi crown prince. Wang and Chen continued to be in charge of the military.\n\nChen, however, was unhappy about the situation, believing Xiao Yuanming to be unworthy of the throne. Despite Wang Sengbian's knowledge of Chen's displeasure, however, Wang did not suspect Chen of having any rebellious intentions, as they had been friendly, and Wang and Chen had agreed on having Wang Sengbian's son Wang Wei (\u738b\u9820) marry Chen's daughter, although the marriage had not been established on account of the recent death of Wang Sengbian's mother. in fall 555, believing reports that Northern Qi was going to attack, Wang sent his secretary Jiang Gan (\u6c5f\u65f0) to Jingkou to alert Chen. Chen instead detained Jiang and started a surprise attack on Wang. With Wang not suspecting that an attack would occur, Chen quickly reached Wang's headquarters at Shitou (a fortress near Jiankang), capturing and killing Wang Sengbian and Wang Wei. He took over control of the imperial government, forcing Xiao Yuanming to abdicate and making Xiao Fangzhi emperor (as Emperor Jing).\n\nImmediately, Chen faced resistance from the generals Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd), Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04), and Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Wang Sengbian's brother Wang Sengzhi (\u738b\u50e7\u667a) and son-in-law Du Kan (\u675c\u9f95). (Du was the governor of Chen's home commandery of Wuxing, and the historian Bo Yang had speculated that Du's disrespect for Chen and his curbing of special privileges that Chen's clan was exerting in Wuxing might have been an impetus fo Chen's rebellion against Wang.) Chen initially sent his nephew Chen Qian and his general Zhou Wenyu against Du and Du's ally Wei Zai (\u97cb\u8f09), but the campaign was inconclusive, and Chen subsequently went to attack himself. Meanwhile, Xu and Ren, aided by Northern Qi, made a surprise attack on Jiankang, nearly capturing it, but were repelled by Chen's general Hou Andu. Soon, Chen defeated Wei and Wei surrendered, and Chen returned to Jiankang, leaving Zhou to face Du.\n\nDespite Northern Qi aid, Xu and Ren could not defeat Chen, and Chen put Shitou, which the Northern Qi general Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469) had captured, under siege. Liu sought peace, but requested Chen to send his relatives as hostages to Northern Qi. Most officials advocated peace, and Chen, despite his skepticism about such a peace holding, agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Yuan's grandson Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), as hostages, permitting Northern Qi forces to withdraw, and Xu and Ren withdrew with them.\n\nBy spring 556, Du had either been captured or surrendered to Zhou and Chen Qian, and Chen Baxian executed Du. Wang Sengzhi fled to Northern Qi, and the capital region was largely under Chen Baxian's control. Meanwhile, Northern Qi forces were preparing another attack, but they invited Xiao Yuanming to their camp to discuss peace. Chen sent Xiao Yuanming to Northern Qi camp, but before talks could began, Xiao Yuanming died from a severe infection on his back. By summer 556, Northern Qi forces were again descending on Jiankang, but once there, their forces stalemated with Chen's forces. Northern Qi forces' food supplies soon ran out, and Chen defeated them, killing Xu and capturing a number of Northern Qi generals, whom Chen executed. (In response, Northern Qi executed Chen Tanlang, although Chen Baxian never found out during his life time.) Meanwhile, Hou Tian, having been defeated by another general, Hou Ping (\u4faf\u5e73), chose to submit to Chen.\n\nDuring the next year, Chen began to receive greater and greater titles and offices, progressing from being the Marquess of Changcheng to Duke of Changcheng to Duke of Yixing to Duke of Chen to Prince of Chen. In 557, Xiao Bo declared a resistance against Chen from Guang Province. Soon, however, Zhou defeated Xiao Bo's general Ouyang Wei (\u6b50\u967d\u9820), and Xiao Bo was killed by his own generals. At the same time, Wang Lin, who controlled modern Hunan and eastern Hubei, suspicious of Chen's intentions, refused his summon to Jiankang and prepared for battle instead. Chen sent Zhou and Hou Andu against Wang Lin. In winter 557, Chen had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty as its Emperor Wu. He created Emperor Jing the Prince of Jiangyin. He posthumously honored his parents emperor and empress, his deceased wife Lady Qian empress, and his deceased son Chen Ke crown prince. He created his wife Zhang Yao'er empress.\n\n[edit] Reign\n\nWhile it is not known when Emperor Wu became a Buddhist, once he became emperor he immediately took steps to officially sanction Buddhism, as he displayed a relic believed to be a Buddha's tooth and held a major Buddhist festival. He also, following the lead of Liang's Emperor Wu, offered himself to Buddha's service on one occasion. He made several requests to Western Wei's successor state Northern Zhou to return Chen Chang and Chen Xu, and while Northern Zhou promised to do so, they would actually not be returned in Emperor Wu's lifetime.\n\nMeanwhile, news that Emperor Wu had accepted the throne had reached the front where Zhou Wenyu and Hou Andu were engaging Wang Lin, greatly depressing Zhou and Hou's forces, as this removed a major appeal that they had -- that Wang was being a rebel for refusing to follow Emperor Jing's orders. Wang defeated Zhou and Hou and captured them. After doing so, however, both Chen forces and Wang Lin's forces were stalemated by the fact that the general Lu Xida (\u9b6f\u6089\u9054), who controlled Northern Jiang Province (\u5317\u6c5f\u5dde, roughly modern Anqing, Anhui), was accepting overtures from both sides but refusing to actually obey either side. Not able to make progress in his campaign against the new Chen state, Wang sought help from Northern Qi and requested that it return Xiao Zhuang to be emperor. Soon, Northern Qi returned Xiao Zhuang, and Wang Lin declared Xiao Zhuang emperor at Ying Province (\u90e2\u5dde, modern eastern Hubei).\n\nIn summer 558, Emperor Wu had the former Emperor Jing of Liang killed. He sent Hou Tian and Xu Du (\u5f90\u5ea6) to attack Wang Lin, but soon negotiated a peace with Wang Lin, after Wang's general Yu Xiaoqing (\u4f59\u5b5d\u9803) was defeated by the independent general Zhou Di (\u5468\u8fea). (Meanwhile, Zhou Wenyu and Hou escaped from Wang's custody and returned to Chen, although Zhou was soon assassinated by the independent general Xiong Tanlang (\u718a\u66c7\u6717).)\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wu suffered a major illness and died suddenly. At that time, the only close relative of his in Chen territory, his nephew Chen Qian the Prince of Linchuan, was away building a fort at Nanhuan (\u5357\u7696, in modern Anqing, Anhui). Empress Zhang, after consulting the officials Du Leng (\u675c\u7a1c) and Cai Jingli (\u8521\u666f\u6b77), chose not to announce Emperor Wu's death and summoned Chen Qian back from Nanhuan. The imperial officials decided to support Chen Qian as emperor, and while Empress Zhang was initially hesitant, hoping that Chen Chang would return, she eventually agreed, and Chen Qian took the throne as Emperor Wen.\n\nEra name\n\nYongding (\u6c38\u5b9a y\u01d2ng d\u00ecng) 557-559\n\n[edit] Personal information\n\nFather\n\nChen Wenzan (\u9673\u6587\u8b9a), posthumously honored as Emperor Jing\n\nMother\n\nLady Dong, probably Chen Wenzan's wife, posthumously honored as Empress An\n\nWives\n\nLady Qian, daughter of Qian Zhongfang (\u9322\u4ef2\u65b9), posthumously honored as Empress Zhao\n\nEmpress Zhang Yao'er (created 557), mother of Prince Chang\n\nChildren\n\nChen Ke (\u9673\u514b), died early, posthumously honored as Crown Prince Xiaohuai\n\nFour other sons who died early\n\nChen Chang (\u9673\u660c), Prince Xian of Hengyang (created and killed by Emperor Wen of Chen 560)\n\nPrincess Mu of Kuaiji\n\nPrincess Yongsi\n\nChen Baxian \u9673\u9738\u5148 [12828] Founder of the Chen dynasty as Chen Wudi.

During his reign, northern qi's imperial administration was plunged into severe corruption and wastefulness, with the military suffering after Gao Wei killed the great general Hul\u00fc Guang in 572. Rival Emperor Wu of northern zhou launched a major attack in 576, and northern qi forces collapsed. Gao Wei, who formally passed the throne to his son Gao Heng, was captured while trying to flee to chen dynasty , and later that year, the northern zhou emperor executed him and almost all members of his clan.\n\nIn 565, with astrological signs indicating that the imperial position should be changed, Emperor Wucheng's favored officials He Shikai and Zu Ting, wanting to ingratiate themselves with Empress Hu and Gao Wei as well, suggested that Emperor Wucheng avoid the ill fortune by passing the throne to Gao Wei. Emperor Wucheng agreed, and Gao Wei, at age eight, became emperor, although Emperor Wucheng, carrying the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor), retained the actual powers. Emperor Wucheng created Gao Wei's wife Crown Princess Hul\u00fc empress.\n\nGao Wei was born in 557, when his father Gao Dan was the Prince of Changguang under Emperor Wenxuan, Gao Dan's older brother. Gao Wei's mother was Gao Dan's wife Princess Hu, and he was her first son, but not his father Gao Dan's first son\u2014as Gao Dan's concubine Lady Li also gave birth several hours earlier on the same day Princess Hu did, to Gao Chuo (\u9ad8\u7dbd). However, as Princess Hu was his wife, Gao Dan publicly announced that Gao Wei was born first and treated him as the first-born. Thereafter, he was named Gao Dan's heir apparent.\n\nGao Wei was considered a young man of weak personality, and while Gao Wei was emperor, Emperor Wucheng and Retired Empress Hu both greatly favored his younger brother, Gao Yan the Prince of Dongping, honoring Gao Yan with many high offices and making sure that Gao Yan received all of the same supplies as his emperor brother did. Gao Yan was considered intelligent and decisive, and he once asked Emperor Wucheng, \"My brother is weak in personality. How can he lead the empire?\" Both Emperor Wucheng and Retired Empress Hu considered deposing Gao Wei and making Gao Yan emperor, but did not actually do so.\n\nBoth Zu and Lady Lu then reported the song to Gao Wei to further foster his suspicion of Hul\u00fc. Gao Wei consulted another favorite, Han Zhangluan, who believed that he should not suspect Hul\u00fc, so Gao Wei initially took no action. Zu, however, would not relent, and he had Hul\u00fc's subordinate Feng Shirang (\u5c01\u58eb\u8b93) make a secret submission indicating that when Hul\u00fc had brought the army close to Yecheng in 571, he was plotting a coup. Gao Wei believed it this time, and under Zu's suggestion, he awarded Hul\u00fc a horse, and then, as Hul\u00fc arrived at the palace to thank the emperor, he had Liu Taozhi seize Hul\u00fc and strangle him to death. Hul\u00fc's clan was nearly all slaughtered\u2014including his brother and fellow general Hul\u00fc Xian (\u659b\u5f8b\u7fa8) and his sons Hul\u00fc Wudu (\u659b\u5f8b\u6b66\u90fd), Hul\u00fc Shixiong (\u659b\u5f8b\u4e16\u96c4), and Hul\u00fc Hengqie (\u659b\u5f8b\u6046\u4f3d). Only his youngest son Hul\u00fc Zhong (\u659b\u5f8b\u937e), who was only a few years old, was spared. Empress Hul\u00fc was deposed and confined to a subsidiary palace.\n\nIn 572, Empress Hul\u00fc gave birth to a daughter, and Gao Wei, wanting to please Hul\u00fc Guang, initially claimed that she gave birth to a son, but eventually had to admit that the child was a daughter. By this point, Hul\u00fc Guang was in serious conflict with the powerful officials Zu and Mu. He disliked Zu, and he often complained to his generals that Zu rarely consulted military generals. Once, when he was resting at a governmental building, Zu, who had blinded during a period of imprisonment during Emperor Wucheng's reign, rode past him without realizing that Hul\u00fc was there, and never got off the horse as demanded by customs of the time. Hul\u00fc angrily stated, \"Who does he think he is?\" Zu, realizing that Hul\u00fc disliked him, bribed Hul\u00fc's servant and asked the servant about Hul\u00fc's opinion of him. The servant stated, \"Ever since you came into power, the Minister Prince [a reference to Hul\u00fc, as Hul\u00fc carried the title of Prince of Xianyang] each night sighed and stated, \"With a blind man in power, the empire will surely be destroyed. \" Meanwhile, Mu had once requested to marry Hul\u00fc's daughter by a concubine, but Hul\u00fc refused. Further, when Mu requested that Gao Wei grant him the public fields at Jinyang, Hul\u00fc publicly opposed the action as being detrimental to the grazing of the army's horses. Zu and Mu therefore both despited Hul\u00fc. They therefore fostered suspicion of Hul\u00fc in the emperor's mind, and that suspicion was exacerbated by the fact that Empress Hul\u00fc was not favored by Gao Wei.\n\nLater in 571, Gao Wei's brother Gao Yan, now the Prince of Langye, angry at the hold that He Shikai had on power, killed him, and further mobilized his troops to consider seizing power and killing Lady Lu and her son Mu Tipo, who had also become powerful. Hul\u00fc, while he approved of Gao Yan's killing of He Shikai, was still loyal to the emperor, and he intervened on the emperor's side, ordering Gao Yan's troops to disband, and they collapsed. Hul\u00fc seized Gao Yan and took him to the palace. At Hul\u00fc's urging, Gao Wei spared Gao Yan initially, although in winter 571 he nevertheless had Liu Taozhi suffocate Gao Yan, and Gao Yan's four posthumous sons were also killed. Also in winter 571, after discovering that Empress Dowager Hu had been conducting an affair with the Buddhist monk Tanxian (\u66c7\u737b), he executed Tanxian and put Empress Dowager Hu under house arrest, disallowing the nobles from visiting her. In spring 572, in order to placate her, however, he posthumously honored Gao Yan with the unusual title \"Emperor Gong'ai of Chu\" and honored Gao Yan's wife Princess Li \"Empress of Chu. \" Zu and Lady Lu tried to have Lady Lu made empress dowager to replace Empress Dowager Hu, but Gao Wei did not do so. Empress Dowager Hu, in order to please her son, summoned the daughter of her brother Hu Changren (\u80e1\u9577\u4ec1) to the palace and dressed her in the best clothes. Gao Wei saw her and was infatuated with her, and he took her as a concubine.\n\nDuring much of Emperor Wucheng's and Gao Wei's reign up to this point, rival northern zhou had gradually encroached on northern qi territory, making minor gains on the borders. In winter 570, Hul\u00fc Guang launched a counterattack and captured significant amounts of territory north of the Fen River (\u6c7e\u6c34, flowing through modern Linfen, Shanxi ). He then also defeated northern zhou troops at Yiyang (\u5b9c\u967d, in modern Luoyang, Henan ). On his way back to the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), Gao Wei ordered his troops demobilized even though many of the soldiers had not received rewards. however, he received an order to demobilize his troops. Hul\u00fc Guang submitted a secret petition to Gao Wei, requesting the emperor to send imperial messengers to the army to honor the soldiers. Gao Wei did not act immediately, however, and the army approached Yecheng without receiving any words from the emperor. Gao Wei was displeased that Hul\u00fc Guang brought the army close to the capital, and he summoned Hul\u00fc to the palace before sending messengers to honor the soldiers and demobilizing them.\n\nAfter Emperor Wucheng's death, while Gao Wei formally took on imperial authorities himself, the government was led by a group of eight high-level officials\u2014He Shikai, Lou Dingyuan (\u5a41\u5b9a\u9060), Zhao Yanshen (\u8d99\u5f65\u6df1), Gao Wenyao (\u9ad8\u6587\u9059), Tang Yong (\u5510\u9095), Qilian Meng (\u7da6\u9023\u731b), Gao Anagong, and Empress Dowager Hu's cousin Hu Changcan (\u80e1\u9577\u7cb2). However, infighting soon developed, as by spring 569, Emperor Wucheng's cousin Gao Rui (\u9ad8\u53e1) the Prince of Zhao Commandery, Emperor Wucheng's brother Gao Run (\u9ad8\u6f64) the Prince of Fengyi, Emperor Wucheng's nephew Gao Yanzong the Prince of Ande, Lou, and Gao Wenyao, were all recommending that He Shikai, who was clearly the most powerful of the eight, be made a provincial governor. Gao Rui, in particular, was most critical of He Shikai for being corrupt and immoral, as it was an open secret that He Shikai was having an affair with Empress Dowager Hu. Faced with the officials' pressure, He Shikai agreed to be sent out to the provinces (along with Gao Wenyao), and it was announced that after Emperor Wucheng's burial, He Shikai would be made the governor of Yan Province while Gao Wenyao would be made the governor of Western Yan Province (\u897f\u5157\u5dde, roughly modern Anyang, Henan ). After Emperor Wucheng's burial, Gao Rui pressured He Shikai to leave Yecheng as quickly as possible, despite Empress Dowager Hu's desire to keep He Shikai for 100 days after Emperor Wucheng's burial. He Shikai bribed Lou and was permitted to meet Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Wei once more\u2014and he persuaded them that the high level officials were intending harm to them and that they could only trust him. Gao Wei thus issued an edict rebuking Gao Rui. When Gao Rui nevertheless entered the palace to try to pressure Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Wei to remove He Shikai. Empress Dowager Hu, instead, arrested Gao Rui and had the guard commander Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) strangle Gao Rui. Thereafter, He Shikai's power went unchecked. The other favorite associates of Gao Wei\u2014including Gao Wei's wet nurse Lu Lingxuan and her son Mu Tipo, as well as Zu Ting.\n\nLate reign\n\nAfter Empress Hul\u00fc was deposed, Lady Lu wanted Consort Mu to be empress, but Empress Dowager Hu wanted her niece Empress Hu to be empress. She, however, did not believe she had enough persuasive power, and so she had to flatter Lady Lu and give her gifts. Lady Lu also saw that Gao Wei favored Empress Hu, and so agree to jointly suggest, with Zu Ting, that Consort Hu be created empress, and Gao Wei did so. He favored Empress Hu so greatly that he made clothes for her out of pearls, although those clothes were later destroyed in a fire. However, Lady Lu did not relent in her hopes of making Consort Mu empress, stating to Gao Wei, \"How can a son be crown prince and a mother be a servant girl, a concubine?\" But as Gao Wei favored Empress Hu, she could not carry out her wishes. She therefore engaged witches to use witchcraft on Empress Hu. It was said that within a month, Empress Hu began to show symptoms of psychosis, often mumbling to herself or laughing without cause. Gao Wei began to fear and dislike her. In winter 572, Lady Lu put Consort Mu in empress clothing and put her in a tent, surrounded with magnificent jewelry, and then told Gao Wei, \"Let me show you a holy woman. \" When Gao Wei saw that it was Consort Mu, Lady Lu stated, \"For a woman this beautiful not to be empress, who would be qualified to be empress?\" Gao Wei agreed with her, and he created Consort Mu \"Right Empress\" and gave Empress Hu the title \"Left Empress. Around the new year 573, Lady Lu further falsely told Empress Dowager Hu that Empress Hu had denigrated Empress Dowager Hu's moral character\u2014and Empress Dowager Hu, in anger, without verifying the information, ordered Empress Hu expelled from the palace, and then had Gao Wei depose her. Thereafter, it was said that Lady Lu and Mu Tipo were so powerful and so corrupt that they were openly taking bribes and selling the imperial offices, and all that they wished were carried out. By spring 573, Mu Tipo, Gao Anagong, and Han Zhanglauan were referred to as \"the Three Nobles\", and they controlled the government. The issue of corruption became severe, and with Gao Wei himself living in luxury and waste, constantly building palaces and tearing them downand rebuilding them, the northern qi imperial treasury was at a state of exhaustion.\n\nIn spring 573, Gao Wei created Right Empress Mu sole empress.\n\nAlso in spring 573, Zu Ting, knowing that Gao Wei had a love of literature, with Gao Wei's approval, established the Wenlin Hall (\u6587\u6797\u9928), headed by the officials Li Delin and Yan Zhitui (\u984f\u4e4b\u63a8). They retained a group of literarily-capable men and authored one of the great compendia of the era, the Xiuwendian Yulan (\u4fee\u6587\u6bbf\u5fa1\u89bd).\n\nIn summer 573, rival Emperor Xuan of Chen launched a major attack across the Yangtze River, commanded by the general Wu Mingche. Gao Wei went against the advice of the officials Wang Hong (\u738b\u7d18), who advocated passive resistance while reducing tax burdens to strengthen the people's resolve, and Zhao Yanshan, who advocated commissioning the liang dynasty general Wang Lin, who had long wanted to reestablish Liang at Chen's expense, with an army. Rather, Gao Wei sent reinforcements to the attacked provinces\u2014but only in small amounts, not sufficient to resist Chen forces\u2014with the main force commanded by Wei Pohu (\u5c09\u7834\u80e1) and Zhangsun Hongl\u00fce (\u9577\u5b6b\u6d2a\u7565) defeated by Wu's troops. Wang, who accompanied Wei as a consultant, was then ordered to go to Shouyang (\u58fd\u967d, in modern Luan , Anhui ) to defend that city against attack\u2014but with severe limitations on his authority. Soon, Shouyang fell, and Wang was captured and executed by Wu. All of northern qi's territory between the Yangtze and the Huai River fell into Chen control. Despite the losses, however, Mu Tipo and Han advocated continued epicurean lifestyle on Gao Wei's and their own parts, with Mu famously stating, \"Even if we lost all territory south of the Yellow River, we can still be like Qiuzi (\u9f9c\u8332, a city state in modern Xinjiang ). But what is more piteous is that a human life is like borrowed time, and we should use all this short period to seek pleasure. Why worry about Shouyang?\" Gao Wei agreed, and continued to spend his days feasting.\n\nDuring the Chen attack, Zu, who had become embroiled in conflict with Lady Lu, Mu Tipo, and Han, was expelled from the central government over his attempt to impose a reform regime to streamline the government and reduce expenses. He would not return, and after his departure, the government became even more inefficient than before. Further, also during the campaign, Gao Wei became suspicious of his cousin Gao Changgong (\u9ad8\u9577\u606d) the Prince of Lanling, a capable general, and poisoned Gao Changgong to death.\n\nAlso during the Chen attack, another major wrongful massacre was carried out at Gao Wei's orders. Gao Wei was intending to visit the secondary capital Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), which he and his predecessors did on a regular basis. The senior officials Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212) and Zhang Diao (\u5f35\u96d5) -- who had been Gao Wei's teacher previously and respected by him\u2014believed that for Gao Wei to go to Jinyang would be misinterpreted by the populace as a flight to Jinyang, and would lead to popular panic, so they, with a number of other officials\u2014including Feng Xiaoyan (\u5c01\u5b5d\u7430), Liu Ti (\u5289\u9016), Pei Ze (\u88f4\u6fa4), and Guo Zun (\u90ed\u9075) -- submitted a joint petition requesting Gao Wei to stay at Yecheng. Han suggested that these officials were in fact intending to rebel, and Gao Wei agreed, executing Cui, Zhang, Feng, LIu, Pei, and Guo. He further exiled their clan members, confiscated their women, and castrated their boys.\n\nIn spring 574, Gao Sihao (\u9ad8\u601d\u597d) the Prince of Nan'an and governor of Shuo Province (\u6714\u5dde, roughly modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ), angry that he had been disrespected by Gao Wei's servant Zhuogu Guangbian (\u65ab\u9aa8\u5149\u5f01), rebelled. Gao Wei sent Tang Yong to resist Gao Sihao while personally leading the next army north, but before he could get there, Gao Sihao was defeated, and he committed suicide by drowning.\n\nMeanwhile, around this time, Gao Wei had become less attracted to Empress Mu, instead becoming more infatuated with Empress Mu's servant girl Feng Xiaolian, making her an imperial consort. They went everywhere together, and they swore to live and to die together.\n\nThe historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, had this to say about Gao Wei and his reign:\n\nThe ruler of Qi was not a good speaker and could not speak clearly, and so he did not like to meet with governmental officials. He spoke nothing to anyone except his jesters and servants. He was weak in his personality and was fearful of people staring at him. Even the most honored officials or the head of the government were not allowed to look at him, and therefore the officials could only make summary reports and then withdraw in panic. He inherited the luxurious and wasteful living habits of Emperor Wucheng and thought that this was proper. All of the women and eunuchs of the palace dressed in the best silk and ate delicacies. It sometimes took 10,000 pi [\u5339, a measurement unit for textile] to make one skirt for them. Each of them competed with each other for the newest and most wonderful things, and clothes made in the morning may be considered old and out of style that same evening. He spent much effort on building palaces and gardens of the greatest splendor, but his affections for them could not last, so all buildings were torn down and rebuilt and torn down again. These construction activities went around the clock without ceasing, with great torches used for illumination at night, and water boiled to mix with the dirt in the winter. In order to carve Buddha images in the western hills of Jinyang, over 10,000 torches were used for one night, bright enough to shine on the Jinyang Palace like it was the day. Whenever there were natural disastrous, ill omens, or agrarian rebellions, he never blamed himself, but would only hold great vegetarian feasts to treat the Buddhist and Taoist monks, believing that this would bring divine blessings so that difficulties would pass. He liked to play the pipa and sing, and he wrote a song entitled, Song of No Worries (\u7121\u6101\u66f2), with several hundred servants singing with him, leading to the people referring to him as \"the Son of Heaven with no worries. \" He established \"the Pauper Boy's Village\" within the Hualin Garden (\u83ef\u6797\u5712), where he would put on pauper clothes and beg in the village, believing that this was great joy. He also built models of the important border cities and had soldiers act like northern zhou soldiers to attack them, and with him resisting the attacks with the eunuchs.\n\nHis favorite servants Lu Lingxuan, Mu Tipo, Gao Anagong, and Han Zhangluan controlled the government. The eunuchs Deng Changyong (\u9127\u9577\u9852) and Chen Dexin (\u9673\u5fb7\u4fe1), and the Xiongnu He Hongzhen (\u4f55\u6d2a\u73cd) also participated in the important decisionmaking. Each of them brought their friends and relatives into the government and promoted them beyond proper bounds. The officials' promotions were all dependent on the amount of bribes they paid; those who submitted bribes were promoted and those who did not were demoted. The judges issue their verdicts depending on bribes as well, with the rich allowed to live and the poor sentenced to death. The officials compete in their corruption and flattery, to the detriment of the people. The servants, such as Liu Taozhi, were promoted to great honors and created princes. Almost 10,000 of such persons as eunuchs, Xiongnu, singers, dancers, magicians, and slaves, received honors beyond propriety. Hundreds of non-members of the imperial Gao clan received creations as princes. The high rank of Kaifu (\u958b\u5e9c) included more than 1,000, and the rank of Yitong (\u5100\u540c) was filled innumerably. There were more than 20 generals of the imperial guards. There were tens of imperial attendants. Even dogs, horses, eagles, and hunting cocks received official posts, and were allowed to enjoy the food portions of their salaries. The servants attended the emperor at all times and think of nothing but to please the emperor. A musical can cost over 100 million coins. Later, after the imperial treasury was exhausted, he used the commanderies and counties as awards, giving two to three commanderies or six to seven counties at each time, to allow the servants to auction off the governor and magistrate posts and pocket the proceeds. Therefore, the commandery governors and county magistrates were largely wealthy merchants who find ways to extract and extort from the people, and the people could not live.\n\nEmperor Wu of northern zhou had long wanted to destroy northern qi, and he launched a major attack in fall 575. Several of his generals suggested attacking Jinyang, but he instead attacked Luoyang. However, when he laid siege to the fortress Zhongtan (second character not in Unicode), it was well-defended by the northern qi general Fu Fu (\u5085\u4f0f), and Emperor Wu became ill during the siege and withdrew. During the meantime, however, Chen forces, commanded by Wu, commenced a new attack, putting Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu ) under siege. (For the rest of northern qi's existence, however, Wu would not be able to actually capture Pengcheng. )\n\nIn winter 576, northern zhou's Emperor Wu again launched another major attack on northern qi, putting Pingyang (\u5e73\u967d, in modern Linfen, Shanxi ) under siege and then capturing it. At the time the news of northern zhou's attack on Pingyang arrived, Gao Wei was hunting at Qilian Lake (\u7941\u9023\u6c60, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ) with Consort Feng, and Gao Anagong, not believing the matter to be serious, did not report the news to Gao Wei. Only after Pingyang fell did Gao Anagong give Gao Wei the news. Gao Wei gathered his troops and headed for Pingyang, and Emperor Wu, believing Gao Wei's troops to be still strong, withdrew but put the general Liang Shiyan (\u6881\u58eb\u5f65) in charge of defending Pingyang against the northern qi counterattack. The northern qi forces sieged Pingyang with all effort\u2014and after several days, were able to breach the wall\u2014but at this point, Gao Wei stopped his attack and summoned Consort Feng so she could witness the fall of the city. When she arrived, however, northern zhou forces had already filled in the breach, and therefore held the city. With Pingyang under siege, Emperor Wu launched another attack to try to lift the siege on Pingyang. Gao Anagong advised against direct faceoff with Emperor Wu's troops, but Gao Wei, egged on by eunuchs, chose to directly engage Emperor Wu, and the armies engaged in a battle around the time of near year 577. A minor fallback by some of Gao Wei's troops caused Consort Feng and Mu Tipo to panick, and they suggested an immediate retreat\u2014and Gao Wei abandoned his troops and fled to Jinyang, causing his army to collapse.\n\nOnce at Jinyang, instead of preparing for resistance, Gao Wei instead planned to have his cousins Gao Yanzong the Prince of Ande and Gao Xiaoheng (\u9ad8\u5b5d\u73e9) the Prince of Guangning defend Jinyang, planning to himself flee north to Shuo Province, against Gao Yanzong's advice. He first sent Empress Dowager Hu and Gao Heng to Shuo Province. When northern zhou forces arrived at Jinyang, he left Jinyang under Gao Yanzong's command and fled, initially intending to flee to Shuo Province or Tujue, but after persuasion by the general Mei Shenglang (\u6885\u52dd\u90ce), headed back to Yecheng, accompanied by Gao Anagong. Meanwhile, Mu Tipo abandoned Gao Wei and surrendered to northern zhou. His mother Lady Lu committed suicide, and his family members were all either executed or sentenced to hard labor. Meanwhile, Tang Yong, still at Jinyang, along with other generals, persuaded Gao Yanzong to take the throne himself\u2014stating to him that if he did not, they could not die for him. When Gao Wei heard this news, he commented, \"I would rather that Bing Province [the province containing Jinyang] fall into Zhou's hands than Ande's hands. \" Soon, northern zhou forces put Jinyang under siege, and they were able to breach the defenses at the east gate\u2014but a counterattack by Gao Yanzong's troops lead to a major rout against northern zhou forces, in which Emperor Wu almost died. However, Gao Yanzong's troops went into celebration and could not regroup. The next day, another northern zhou attack finally captured the city.\n\nOnce Gao Wei arrived at Yecheng, he ordered that high rewards be posted for people who would join the army, but he himself was unwilling to contribute treasures from his own palace holdings. Further, when he was giving a speech intending to raise morale, his irreverent attitude instead infuriated the generals. The generals and the officials all lost the will to fight. The official Gao Mai (\u9ad8\u52f1), who had escorted Empress Dowager Hu and Crown Prince Heng back from Shuo Province, suggested making one last stand at Yecheng, but Gao Wei did not accept his suggestion. When astrologers indicated that the imperial seat is about to be changed, he decided to pass the throne to Gao Heng and did so in spring 577, even though Gao Heng was only seven years old. Gao Wei himself took the title of Taishang Huang."}, {"url": "https://ctext.org/datawiki.pl?if=en&res=557104", "page_content": "(\u5b87\u6587\u6cf0 Y\u01d4w\u00e9n T\u00e0i) (507\u2013556), nickname(\u9ed1\u737a), formally(\u5b89\u5b9a\u6587\u516c), later further posthumously honored by Northern Zhou initially as(\u6587\u738b) then as(\u6587\u7687\u5e1d) with the temple name(\u592a\u7956), was the paramount general of the Chinese/Xianbei state Western Wei , a branch successor state of Northern Wei . In 534, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei , seeking to assert power independent of the paramount general Gao Huan , fled to Yuwen's domain, and when Gao subsequently proclaimed Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei emperor, a split of Northern Wei was effected, and when Yuwen subsequently poisoned Emperor Xiaowu to death around the new year 535 and declared his cousin Yuan Baoju emperor (as Emperor Wen), the split was formalized, with the part under Gao's and Emperor Xiaojing's control known as Eastern Wei and the part under Yuwen's and Emperor Wen's control known as Western Wei. For the rest of his life, Yuwen endeavored to make Western Wei, then much weaker than its eastern counterpart, a strong state, and after his death, his son Yuwen Jue seized the throne from Emperor Gong of Western Wei , establishing Northern Zhou.\n\nRead more...: Early career Taking control over western provinces Alliance with Emperor Xiaowu During Emperor Wens reign During Emperors Feis reign During Emperor Gongs reign Family Ancestry\n\nEarly career\n\nYuwen Tai was born in 507, and was a descendant of the last chieftain of the Xianbei Yuwen tribe Yuwen Yidougui, whose tribe was destroyed by Murong Huang, the founding ruler of Former Yan. Yuwen Yidougui's descendants served as generals during Former Yan and its successor state Later Yan. Later, when Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei defeated the Later Yan emperor Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin), Yuwen Tai's great-great-grandfather Yuwen Ling (\u5b87\u6587\u9675) surrendered to Northern Wei, and was relocated to Wuchuan (\u6b66\u5ddd, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). Yuwen Tai's father Yuwen Gong (\u5b87\u6587\u80b1) was known for his ability in battle. In 524, with Northern Wei's northern provinces overrun by agrarian rebels, Wuchuan was being held by one of the major rebels, Poliuhan Baling (\u7834\u516d\u97d3\u62d4\u9675). Yuwen Gong and another local leader, Heba Duba (\u8cc0\u62d4\u5ea6\u62d4), ambushed Poliuhan's general Wei Kegu (\u885b\u53ef\u5b64) and killed Wei, temporarily restoring order. It was probably at this time that Yuwen Tai met and befriended Heba Duba's son Heba Yue (\u8cc0\u62d4\u5cb3). Sometime after this incident, Yuwen Gong and his sons fled to Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71, in modern Baoding, Hebei), and were forced to join the army of another rebel general, Xianyu Xiuli (\u9bae\u4e8e\u4fee\u79ae). Yuwen Gong died in a battle between Xianyu's troops and Northern Wei troops, but Yuwen Tai continued to serve in Xianyu's troops. After Xianyu was killed by his general Yuan Hongye (\u5143\u6d2a\u696d) in 526, another Xianyu general, Ge Rong (\u845b\u69ae), in turn killed Yuan and took over Xianyu's troops, and Yuwen continued to serve Ge. However, he saw that Ge was not a competent leader and considered fleeing with his brothers, but before he could carry out his plans, Ge was defeated by the Northern Wei general Erzhu Rong in 528, and Erzhu forcibly moved Ge's troops to his power base at Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Suspicious of the Yuwen brothers, Erzhu killed Yuwen Tai's older brother Yuwen Luosheng (\u5b87\u6587\u6d1b\u751f), but Yuwen Tai pleaded his case with Erzhu and was spared.\n\nIn 529, the Northern Wei prince Yuan Hao, under support from Liang Dynasty, attacked Emperor Xiaozhuang and seized the capital Luoyang, declaring himself emperor. Emperor Xiaozhuang fled north of the Yellow River, and Erzhu advanced south to aid him, sending Heba Yue, who was then serving under Erzhu, to lead his forward troops. Heba made Yuwen Tai his assistant, and later on, after Erzhu defeated Yuan Hao, allowing Emperor Xiaozhuang to return to Luoyang, Yuwen was created the Viscount of Ningdu.\n\nIn 530, Erzhu Rong sent his nephew Erzhu Tianguang, with Heba and Houmochen Yue (\u4faf\u83ab\u9673\u6085) as assistants, to attack the rebel general Moqi Chounu (\u4e07\u4fdf\u919c\u5974), who then occupied the western provinces. Yuwen continued to serve under Heba. After Erzhu Tianguang defeated Moqi, Yuwen, who contributed in the campaign, was made the governor of Yuan Province (\u539f\u5dde, roughly modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and he was said to have ruled the province with such kindness and faith that the people of the province proclaimed, \"Had we had Governor Yuwen as our governor earlier, how would we have joined the rebellion?\"\n\nLate in 530, apprehensive that Erzhu Rong would eventually seize the throne, Emperor Xiaozhuang ambushed him and killed him in the palace. Subsequently, Erzhu Rong's clan members, led by his nephew Erzhu Zhao and cousin Erzhu Shilong, defeated and killed Emperor Xiaozhuang, first making Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang emperor, and then further replaced Yuan Ye with Emperor Jiemin. In 531, the general Gao Huan rebelled against the Erzhus. Erzhu Tianguang was initially not particularly interested in aiding his Erzhu clan members, but felt compelled to, and he departed Chang'an to head east. While Erzhu Tianguang was away, Yuwen advised Heba to rise against the Erzhus, and Heba did, defeating Erzhu Tianguang's brother Erzhu Xianshou (\u723e\u6731\u986f\u58fd), whom Yuwen subsequently captured, dividing control of the territory with Houmochen. By 532, Gao had defeated the Erzhus and seized much of power, deposing Emperor Jiemin and making Emperor Xiaowu emperor instead. When Gao subsequently tried to intimidate Heba into giving up his territory and reporting to Luoyang, but under the advice of Xue Xiaotong (\u859b\u5b5d\u901a), Heba refused. He made Yuwen his lieutenant, and consulted him on most important matters. In 533, Yuwen volunteered to serve as messenger to Gao in order to observe Gao's abilities, and Heba agreed. When Gao met Yuwen, Gao was impressed by the answers Yuwen had to his questions and wanted to detain Yuwen, but Yuwen left Gao's domain before Gao could seize him. Subsequently, Heba sent Yuwen to confer with Emperor Xiaowu, who was not happy about Gao's hold on power, and Emperor Xiaowu and Heba were able to enter into a secret alliance against Gao. Heba made Yuwen the governor of the key Xia Province (\u590f\u5dde, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi).\n\nTaking control over western provinces\n\nBy this point, Heba Yue, in alliance with Houmochen Yue, controlled almost all of the western provinces. However, one provincial governor, Cao Ni (\u66f9\u6ce5), the governor of Ling Province (\u9748\u5dde, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), was aligned with Gao Huan and refused to follow Heba's orders. Heba Yue sent his assistant Zhao Gui (\u8d99\u8cb4) to Xia Province to request Yuwen's opinions, and Yuwen, believing that Houmochen was unreliable, advised against an attack on Cao and suggested instead that Houmochen be attacked. Heba refused\u2014not realizing that by this point, Gao's messengers had persuaded Houmochen to act against him. Heba and Houmochen rendezvoused at Gaoping (\u9ad8\u5e73, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and then headed north against Cao\u2014but as they advanced, Houmochen tricked Heba into coming to his camp for discussions, and then had his son-in-law Yuan Hongjing (\u5143\u6d2a\u666f) assassinate Heba. Initially, Heba's army was surprised and intimidated, but Houmochen, instead of taking over Heba's army, panicked and fled to Shuiluo (\u6c34\u6d1b, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), while Heba's army, without a central commander, withdrew to Pingliang (\u5e73\u6dbc, also in modern Pingliang). After some internal discussions, the army commanders decided to offer the command to Yuwen Tai, and they sent Du Shuozhou (\u675c\u6714\u5468, later changed his name to Helian Da (\u8d6b\u9023\u9054)) to Xia Province to summon Yuwen Tai. Yuwen agreed, and Du and he quickly headed back toward Heba's army. (On the way, they encountered Gao's general Hou Jing, whom Gao had sent to try to take over Heba's army; Hou, surprised, withdrew to Gao's territory quickly.)\n\nEmperor Xiaowu, hearing of Heba's death, sent Yuan Pi (\u5143\u6bd7) to summon both Yuwen and Houmochen to the Luoyang. Houmochen outright refused, and Yuwen persuaded Emperor Xiaowu to allow him to remain in command. Emperor Xiaowu agreed. Yuwen next sent a letter to Houmochen to rebuke him, and when Houmochen did not answer, prepared to launch an attack on Houmochen. He advanced quickly on Shuiluo, and Houmochen withdrew to L\u00fceyang (\u7565\u967d, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), and then to Shanggui (\u4e0a\u90bd, also in modern Tianshui). He then further withdrew from Shanggui, and Shanggui surrendered to Yuwen. He decided to try to flee to Cao's territory, but on the way, believing that Yuwen's forces were close, committed suicide.\n\nAlliance with Emperor Xiaowu\n\nGao Huan made an overture of alliance to Yuwen Tai, but Yuwen refused, instead arresting Gao's messengers and delivering them to Emperor Xiaowu. Emperor Xiaowu authorized him to take over Heba's authorities in the west and created him the Duke of L\u00fceyang.\n\nMeanwhile, Emperor Xiaowu prepared for an attack on Gao, but meanwhile claimed to Gao that he was preparing to attack Yuwen and Heba Yue's brother Heba Sheng (\u8cc0\u62d4\u52dd), who controlled the southern provinces. Gao saw through Emperor Xiaowu's trick, and in summer 534, he instead advanced south toward Luoyang. Emperor Xiaowu's associate Wang Sizheng (\u738b\u601d\u653f), believing that imperial forces would not be able to withstand an attack from Gao, suggested fleeing to Yuwen's domain\u2014despite his own reservations about Yuwen's intentions. Emperor Xiaowu agreed, but at the same time summoned Heba Sheng. However, Heba Sheng did not arrive at Luoyang, while Yuwen sent forces east, commanded by Li Xian (\u674e\u8ce2), to welcome Emperor Xiaowu. In fall 534, before Gao's forces arrived, Emperor Xiaowu fled west, meeting Li on the way. Li escorted Emperor Xiaowu back to Yuwen's headquarters at Chang'an, and Emperor Xiaowu reestablished the imperial government there. He made Yuwen his commander in chief, and married his sister Princess Pingyi\uff08\u51af\u7fca\u516c\u4e3b\uff09 to Yuwen.\n\nAfter Gao entered Luoyang, he sent messengers to request Emperor Xiaowu to return to Luoyang. When Emperor Xiaowu ignored his request, Gao made his distant nephew, Yuan Shanjian, emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), dividing Northern Wei into two, with Eastern Wei recognizing Emperor Xiaojing, and Western Wei recognizing Emperor Xiaowu.\n\nYuwen's relationship with Emperor Xiaowu, however, soon deteriorated. Emperor Xiaowu had engaged in incestuous relationships with three of his cousins, at least one of whom, Yuan Mingyue (\u5143\u660e\u6708) the Princess Pingyuan, followed him to Chang'an. Yuwen disapproved of the relationship, and he persuaded the imperial princes to arrest Yuan Mingyue and put her to death. Emperor Xiaowu became angry, and he often showed his displeasure by tightening his bow or by pounding his table in the palace. Around the new year 535, Yuwen poisoned him to death and made his cousin Yuan Baoju the Prince of Nanyang (Yuan Mingyue's brother) emperor (as Emperor Wen).\n\nDuring Emperor Wens reign\n\nWestern Wei was, initially, the smaller and the weaker of the two successor states of Northern Wei, and early in its existence, there were questions on whether it would survive at all. Yuwen Tai spent much of his effort on preserving existence of Western Wei against repeated attacks led by Gao Huan. He also gradually began to show a trend of following both ancient Chinese customs, as largely encapsulated by the governmental structures of Zhou Dynasty, and restoring Xianbei customs that had largely been abolished by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. In this, he was assisted by the official Su Chuo (\u8607\u7dbd). He also worked on earning the respect of other officials and generals, including Emperor Xiaowu's confidant Wang Sizheng and Pei Xia (\u88f4\u4fe0), both of whom had initially been suspicious of Yuwen and yet later became important and faithful generals serving under him.\n\nIn spring 537, Gao Huan and his generals Dou Tai (\u7ac7\u6cf0) and Gao Aocao (\u9ad8\u6556\u66f9) launched a major attack on Western Wei. Yuwen, correctly judging that Gao Huan was trying to draw Yuwen toward him while allowing Dou to penetrate Western Wei defenses, announced that he was going to lead a withdraw to modern eastern Gansu but instead made a surprise attack on Dou's army at Xiaoguan (\u5c0f\u95dc, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), crushing Dou's forces. Dou committed suicide in shame. Gao Huan and Gao Aocao were forced to withdraw. In fall 537, Yuwen led an attack on Eastern Wei and captured Hengnong (\u6046\u8fb2, in modern Sanmenxia as well). With Western Wei's capital region Guanzhong suffering from a famine, Yuwen remained in Hengnong to collect food from the area, but then heard that Gao Huan was again launching another attack from the northeast, forcing him to return to the Guanzhong region. The forces engaged at Shawan (\u6c99\u82d1, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), after Gao rejected advice from his general Hul\u00fc Qiangju (\u659b\u5f8b\u7f8c\u8209) to directly attack the Western Wei capital Chang'an. Despite Eastern Wei's numerical superiority, Yuwen's forces crushed Gao's forces, and Gao was forced to withdraw. In winter 537, the Western Wei general Dugu Xin captured the former Northern Wei capital Luoyang, and several other nearby provinces also surrendered to Western Wei.\n\nIn spring 538, in order to create an alliance with Rouran, Yuwen first had Emperor Wen bestow the title of Princess Huazheng to Yuan Yi (\u5143\u7fcc), the daughter of a member of the imperial clan, to marry her to Yujiul\u00fc Tahan (\u90c1\u4e45\u95ad\u5854\u5bd2), the brother of Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiul\u00fc Anagui. But Yuwen, believing that to be insufficient, requested Emperor Wen divorce his wife Empress Yifu and marry Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen was forced to agree, and he deposed Empress Yifu, ordering her to become a Buddhist nun, and married Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter as empress. (In 540, under Rouran pressure, Empress Yifu would be forced to commit suicide.)\n\nBy summer 538, however, Eastern Wei generals Hou Jing and Gao Aocao had surrounded Luoyang. Yuwen and Emperor Wen proceeded to Luoyang to try to lift the siege. When Yuwen arrived, Hou and Gao initially lifted the siege on Luoyang, but when Yuwen chased after them, his horse was shot by an arrow, and he fell off his horse and was nearly captured, but both he and his general Li Mu (\u674e\u7a46) pretended to be common soldiers and were able to escape. Once Yuwen returned to Western Wei camp, Western Wei forces again attacked and killed Gao. Later that day, however, an Eastern Wei counterattack inflicted major losses on Western Wei forces, forcing Yuwen to withdraw and rendezvous with Emperor Wen at Hengnong. Meanwhile, however, Eastern Wei captives in Chang'an heard of the Western Wei defeat and rebelled within the city, led by the general Zhao Qingque (\u8d99\u9752\u96c0), forcing the official Zhou Huida (\u5468\u60e0\u9054), who had been left in charge of Chang'an, to flee the city with the crown prince Yuan Qin. Under the advice of Lu Tong (\u9678\u901a), Yuwen quickly returned west and defeated Zhao, suppressing his rebellion. Around this time, Yuwen also started setting up his headquarters at Hua Province (\u83ef\u5dde, roughly modern Weinan), not far from Chang'an but maintaining some distance from the capital, incorporate many talented officials and generals into his staff. He further established a night school for the junior officers and officials in his administration at Hua Province.\n\nIn 541, under Su's suggestion, Yuwen had Emperor Wen issue an edict outlining six principles of government, intending to reduce corruption and wastefulness and strengthen the economy:\n\n\u2022 Qingxinsi (\u6e05\u5fc3\u601d) -- ordering the officials to clean their hearts and not desire many things.\n\n\u2022 Dunjiaohua (\u6566\u6559\u5316) -- instituting a regime of moral education.\n\n\u2022 Jindili (\u76e1\u5730\u5229) -- the concept of encouraging agriculture and maximizing the utility of the land.\n\n\u2022 Zhuoxianliang (\u64e2\u8ce2\u826f) -- finding capable individuals to promote, regardless of their family backgrounds.\n\n\u2022 Xuyusong (\u6064\u7344\u8a1f) -- forbidding torture and instituting the concept that it would be preferable to let the guilty go than to punish an innocent.\n\n\u2022 Junfuyi (\u5747\u8ce6\u5f79) -- the concept that tax and labor burdens must be fair, and that powerful families may not avoid them.\n\nYuwen ordered that all of the officials of the state must study the six principles and further be able to balance budgets, at the pain of being relieved from their offices.\n\nIn spring 543, the Eastern Wei official Gao Zhongmi (\u9ad8\u4ef2\u5bc6), the governor of North Yu Province (\u5317\u8c6b\u5dde, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan), angry that Gao Huan's son Gao Cheng had tried to rape his second wife, and in a dispute with Gao Cheng's assistant Cui Xian (\u5d14\u66b9) over his having divorced Cui's sister, rebelled and surrendered his headquarters of Hulao (\u864e\u7262, in modern Zhengzhou) to Western Wei. Yuwen personally led troops to try to save Gao Zhongmi. At Luoyang, however, he was defeated by the Eastern Wei general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) and was nearly captured, only managing to elude capture by throwing gold at Peng to bribe him and persuade him that if he captured Yuwen, he would be no longer any use to Gao Huan. The next day, a Western Wei counterattack in turn almost killed Gao Huan, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Yuwen was forced to withdraw, but against advice from Feng Zihui (\u5c01\u5b50\u7e6a) and Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Gao Huan failed to chase Yuwen and allowed him to escape. The defeat was considered so major that Yuwen offered to have his rank reduced, but Emperor Wen did not accept the request.\n\nIn 545, Yuwen, seeing that one of Rouran's vassals, Tujue, was growing in strength, sent a messenger, Annuo Pantuo (\u5b89\u8afe\u69c3\u9640) to Tujue to greet its chief Ashina Tumen, to try to establish friendly relations.\n\nIn 546, Gao Huan launched another major attack on Western Wei, putting Yubi (\u7389\u58c1, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) under siege, intending to draw Western Wei forces to try to save Yubi, but Yuwen took no reaction to it, instead leaving Yubi's defense to the general Wei Xiaokuan. Wei ably defended Yubi, draining the strength of the Eastern Wei forces, and as Gao grew ill, Eastern Wei forces were forced to withdraw with major losses.\n\nLater in 546, Su died. Yuwen mourned him greatly, and personally attended Su's burial, crying bitterly.\n\nIn spring 547, the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing, who was in charge of Eastern Wei provinces south of the Yellow River, believing that Gao Huan had died (indeed, Gao had, although his son Gao Cheng was keeping the death a secret) and not willing to submit to Gao Cheng, surrendered the provinces initially to Western Wei and then to Liang. Yuwen conferred honorary titles on Hou, but was initially unwilling to send relief troops. With Wang Sizheng advocating taking four provinces that Hou offered in exchange for aid, however, Yuwen sent Li Bi (\u674e\u5f3c) and Zhao Gui to assist Wang, initially forcing Eastern Wei forces attacking Hou to withdraw. Soon, however, Western Wei generals and Hou began to suspect each other, and after Yuwen ordered Hou to proceed to Chang'an to greet Emperor Wen and Hou refused, the sides officially broke, and the Western Wei generals held onto the four provinces without rendering further aid to Hou, who from that point on depending solely on Liang aid. (Later that year, however, the Eastern Wei general Murong Shaozong (\u6155\u5bb9\u7d39\u5b97) would crush Liang forces commanded by Xiao Yuanming, the nephew of Emperor Wu of Liang, capturing Xiao Yuanming, and then in early 548 defeat Hou and force him to flee to Liang, taking all of the provinces back except the four that Western Wei had taken.)\n\nIn summer 548, Yuwen and Yuan Qin the Crown Prince carried out a tour of Western Wei's border provinces, but upon hearing that Emperor Wen was ill, cut their tour short and returned to Chang'an. However, when they did, Emperor Wen had already been healed, and Yuwen thereafter returned to his headquarters at Hua Province.\n\nAround the same time, the Eastern Wei general Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3, Gao Huan's cousin) launched an attack on Yingchuan (\u6f41\u5ddd, in modern Xuchang, Henan), one of the major cities that Western Wei took from Hou. Wang, defending Yingchuan, initially repelled Eastern Wei's attacks, but with Eastern Wei diverting Wei River (\u6d27\u6c34) to flood Yingchuan, it was in the danger of falling. Yuwen sent Zhao to try to lift the siege, but Zhao was impeded by the water and was unable to proceed to Yingchuan. A counterattack by Wang, however, killed Murong Shaozong and Liu Fengsheng (\u5289\u8c50\u751f), temporarily relieving the pressure on Yingchuan. Gao Cheng himself reinforced Gao Yue's army, and by summer 549 captured Yingchuan, taking Wang captive. With Yingchuan having fallen, Yuwen ordered a general withdrawal from the area, and the provinces taken from Hou were retaken by Eastern Wei.\n\nMeanwhile, with Hou having rebelled against Liang's Emperor Wu in 548 and captured the Liang capital Jiankang in 549, Liang was in disarray, with Hou and the various imperial princes and governors fighting for control. By winter 549, one of the Liang princes, Xiao Cha the Prince of Yueyang (Emperor Wu's grandson), fearing an attack from his uncle Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong (Emperor Wu's son), surrendered his domain around the city Xiangyang (\u8944\u967d, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) to Western Wei, requesting protection. Yuwen sent the general Yang Zhong (\u694a\u5fe0) to aid Xiao Cha, and after Yang defeated and captured Xiao Yi's general Liu Zhongli (\u67f3\u4ef2\u79ae) in spring 550, Western Wei made peace with Xiao Yi, setting the borders in such a way to put Xiao Cha under Western Wei's protection. Yuwen created Xiao Cha the title \"Prince of Liang,\" preparing to have him claim the Liang throne as Western Wei's vassal.\n\nIn summer 550, Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang, who had controlled the Eastern Wei government after Gao Cheng's death in 549, forced Eastern Wei's Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). In response, Yuwen launched a major attack on the newly established Northern Qi, reaching Jian Province (\u5efa\u5dde, roughly modern Jincheng, Shanxi). However, Gao Yang himself led a strong army to defend against Yuwen's attack, and Yuwen, upon hearing that Gao Yang's army was well-run, made the comment, \"Alas, Gao Huan is not dead.\" Meanwhile, due to rains, the livestock that Western Wei forces relied on were dying in large numbers, and so Yuwen was forced to retreat. While there appeared to be few casualties, Northern Qi was in turn able to make minor border gains in light of Yuwen's withdrawal.\n\nAround the new year 550, another son of Liang's Emperor Wu, Xiao Guan (\u856d\u7db8) the Prince of Shaoling, attempted to recapture Anlu (\u5b89\u9678, in modern Xiaogan, Hubei), which Yang had earlier captured from Xiao Yi. Yuwen sent Yang to relieve Anlu, and Yang not only did so, but proceeded to siege Xiao Guan's headquarters at Ru'nan (\u6c5d\u5357, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), capturing it and then executing Xiao Guan.\n\nIn spring 551, Emperor Wen died, and Yuan Qin succeeded him (as Emperor Fei).\n\nDuring Emperors Feis reign\n\nYuwen Tai appeared to hold an even firmer grip on power after Emperor Wen's death. Emperor Fei's wife Empress Yuwen was Yuwen Tai's daughter, and while it was recorded that he did not have any concubines because he loved her greatly, it could have also been that he feared Yuwen's power and therefore did not have any concubines.\n\nIn summer 551, the Tiele were launching an attack on Rouran, when Tujue's chieftain Ashina Tumen intercepted the Tiele and captured a large number of the Tiele people. Ashina Tumen, after his victory, sought a marriage with a daughter of Yujiul\u00fc Anagui. Yujiul\u00fc Anagui felt insulted and refused, viewing the Tujue as inferior; in response, Ashina Tumen cut off relations with Rouran. Yuwen took this opportunity to create an alliance with Tujue, sending the Princess Changle to Tujue to marry Ashina Tumen.\n\nIn summer 552, with Xiao Yi and Hou Jing battling each other, Xiao Yi sought help from Western Wei and agreed to cede Nanzheng (\u5357\u912d, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) to Western Wei, but the order was declined by Xiao Yi's cousin, Xiao Xun (\u856d\u5faa). Yuwen and his general Daxi Wu (\u9054\u595a\u6b66) thus attacked Hanzhong. Xiao Xun instead turned to another brother of Xiao Yi, Xiao Ji the Prince of Wuling for aid, and Xiao Ji sent reinforcements commanded by the general Yang Qianyun (\u694a\u4e7e\u904b). Yuwen and Daxi put Nanzheng under siege, and due to the length of the siege, Yuwen and Daxi became angry and ordered that the city be slaughtered when it falls, but at the intercession of Xiao Xun's chief of staff Liu Fan (\u5289\u74a0), whom Western Wei forces captured during the siege and whose talent Yuwen respected, Yuwen rescinded the order. Soon thereafter, Xiao Xun surrendered, and Nanzheng was in Western Wei hands. Yuwen initially agreed to allow Xiao Xun to return to Liang, but instead detained him, releasing him only after Liu again persuaded him to do so, reminding him of his promise. (During the conversation Liu had with Yuwen, Liu commented that he initially thought of Yuwen as Tang of Shang and King Wu of Zhou, but because of his failure to follow his promise, found him to be less than Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin. Yuwen instead compared himself to Yi Yin (\u4f0a\u5c39, a legendary regent of Shang Dynasty) and Duke of Zhou, apparently disavowing intentions on the throne for the time being.)\n\nIn spring 553, with Xiao Ji and Xiao Yi, both of whom having claimed Liang's imperial title after Hou's fall, battling each other, Xiao Yi sought aid from Western Wei, requesting Western Wei to attack Xiao Ji's home base of Chengdu (\u6210\u90fd, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) from the rear. Yuwen sent his nephew Yuchi Jiong to attack Xiao Ji's domain (modern Sichuan and Chongqing). Most of Xiao Ji's domain fell into Western Wei hands, and subsequently, Xiao Ji was defeated and captured by Xiao Yi.\n\nIn winter 553, the imperial official Yuan Lie (\u5143\u70c8) formed a conspiracy to kill Yuwen, but the news leaked. Yuwen killed him. Following Yuan Lie's death, Emperor Fei himself was angry and wanted to kill Yuwen, despite advise from his cousins Yuan Yu (\u5143\u80b2) the Prince of Huaiai and Yuan Zan (\u5143\u8d0a) the Prince of Guangping. However, Emperor Fei's apparent attempt to court the imperial guards became known by the commanders, several of whom were Yuwen's sons-in-law, and Yuwen put Emperor Fei under house arrest and then deposed him, replacing him with his younger brother Yuan Kuo the Prince of Qi (as Emperor Gong). Yuwen took this opportunity to change the Han names for the Xianbei that Emperor Xiaowen had instituted back to the original Xianbei names, including changing the imperial surname Yuan back to Tuoba. Further, because Xianbei legends indicated that originally, the Tuoba tribe had 36 subtribes and 99 subclans, Yuwen chose 36 key Han generals and 99 commanders and changed their names to Xianbei names, to fill out the original names. Yuwen subsequently put the former emperor to death. It was recorded that Empress Yuwen, Yuwen Tai's daughter, also \"suffered death because of her loyalty to Wei,\" but it is not known exactly whether Yuwen killed her.\n\nDuring Emperor Gongs reign\n\nIn spring 554, while on a diplomatic mission to Liang (now with Xiao Yi as its undisputed emperor\u2014as Emperor Yuan), the Western Wei official Yuwen Renshu (\u5b87\u6587\u4ec1\u6055, probably Yuwen Tai's relative but relationship is unclear) was slighted by Emperor Yuan, who treated Northern Qi's ambassador with far greater respect. Emperor Yuan then further aggravated the situation by sending an impolite letter to Yuwen Tai demanding that the borders be redrawn in accordance with old borders. Yuwen made the comment, \"Xiao Yi is the type of person that, as said in proverbs, 'One who has been abandoned by heaven cannot be revived by anyone else.'\" Yuwen Tai therefore began to prepare attacking Emperor Yuan at his headquarters of Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), as Emperor Yuan had made Jiangling his capital and declined to move back to the old capital Jiankang. The Western Wei general Ma Bofu (\u99ac\u4f2f\u7b26), formerly a Liang general, secretly revealed the attack plans to Emperor Yuan, but Emperor Yuan did not believe Ma and took minimal precautions.\n\nIn winter 554, under Yuwen Tai's orders, Western Wei forces, commanded by Yu Jin (\u4e8e\u8b39), who was assisted by Yuwen Tai's nephew Yuwen Hu and Yang Zhong, launched a major attack on Liang. Emperor Yuan initially did not take reports of the Western Wei attack seriously, and while he summoned his major generals Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin from afar, he himself took little defensive or evasive actions. Yu quickly descended on Jiangling and put it under siege. Soon, Emperor Yuan surrendered, and Western Wei forces gave him to Xiao Cha to be executed. Western Wei created Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (as Emperor Xuan) and gave him the Jiangling area (known in history as Western Liang) in exchange for his old domain of Xiangyang area, which Western Wei took control directly. (However, the rest of Liang did not recognize Emperor Xuan, and soon recognized a rival candidate for the throne supported by Northern Qi, Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming.) Most residents of Jiangling were seized as slaves, although eventually most of them were released by Yuwen after he was persuaded to do so by one of the captives, the Liang official Yu Jicai (\u5ebe\u5b63\u624d).\n\nAround the near year 556, after Tujue's Mugan Khan Ashina Qijin thoroughly crushed Rouran's last khan Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi, Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi fled to Western Wei. Ashina Qijin demanded the execution of Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi, and Yuwen Tai, fearing a Tujue attack, turned Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi and 3000 of his followers to the Tujue ambassadors, who slaughtered them.\n\nAlso around the new year 556, Yuwen Tai promulgated a new government structure, dividing the government into six ministries, based on the Zhou Dynasty model. (This structure was initially devised by Su Chuo, and after Su Chuo's death, Yuwen had it further revised by Lu Bian (\u76e7\u8faf).) He also had Tuoba Yu the Prince of Huai'an submit a request, and then have Emperor Gong formally approve the request, to have all imperial princes reduced in rank to dukes, in accordance with the Zhou tradition.\n\nIn spring 556, Yuwen was pondering the issue of succession. His wife Princess Pingyi had one son, Yuwen Jue, but his oldest son, Yuwen Yu, was born of his concubine Lady Yao, and was married to the daughter of one of his chief generals, Dugu Xin. On the advice of Li Yuan (\u674e\u9060), who argued that the son of a wife always had precedence over the son of a concubine, Yuwen Tai made Yuwen Jue his heir apparent.\n\nin fall 556, while Yuwen Tai was on a tour of the norther provinces, he became ill at Qiantun Mountain (\u727d\u5c6f\u5c71, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia). He summoned his nephew Yuwen Hu to Qiantun and entrusted the affairs of the state as well as his sons to Yuwen Hu. He soon died, and Yuwen Jue took over his titles, while Yuwen Hu took the reins of the state, and under Yuwen Hu's tutelage, Yuwen Jue soon took the throne from Emperor Gong, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Wen, of the Yuan clan of Henan (\u6587\u7687\u540e \u6cb3\u5357\u5143\u6c0f; d. 551)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Jue, Emperor Xiaomin (\u5b5d\u9594\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u89ba; 542\u2013557), third son\n\n\u2022 Empress Xuan, of the Chinu clan (\u5ba3\u7687\u540e \u53f1\u5974\u6c0f; d. 574)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Yong, Emperor Wu (\u6b66\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u9095; 543\u2013578), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhi, Prince Weila (\u885b\u524c\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u76f4; d. 574), sixth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yao clan (\u592b\u4eba \u59da\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Yu, Emperor Ming (\u660e\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u6bd3; 534\u2013560), first son\n\n\u2022 Fei, of the Dabugan clan (\u5983 \u9054\u6b65\u5e79\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Xian, Prince Qiyang (\u9f4a\u716c\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u61b2; 545\u2013578), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Quan clan (\u592b\u4eba \u6b0a\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Jian, Prince Qiaoxiao (\u8b59\u5b5d\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u5109; 551\u2013578), eighth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Wuliuhun clan (\u592b\u4eba \u70cf\u516d\u6e3e\u6c0f), personal name Xianyu (\u986f\u7389)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Tong, Prince Jikang (\u5180\u5eb7\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u901a; 555\u2013571), 12th son\n\n\u2022 Lady, of the Wang clan (\u738b\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhao, Prince Zhaojian (\u8d99\u50ed\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u62db; d. 581), seventh son\n\n\u2022 Lady, of the Zhang clan (\u5f35\u6c0f), personal name N\u00fcbi (\u5973\u7562)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Da, Prince Daibi (\u4ee3\u5970\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u9054; d. 581), 11th son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhen, Duke Songxian (\u5b8b\u737b\u516c \u5b87\u6587\u9707; d. 550), second son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Chun, Prince Chenhuo (\u9673\u60d1\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u7d14; d. 581), ninth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Sheng, Prince Yueye (\u8d8a\u91ce\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u76db; d. 581), tenth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen You, Prince Tengwen (\u6ed5\u805e\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u900c; 556\u2013581), 13th son\n\n\u2022 First daughter (d. 554)\n\n\u2022 Married Yuan Qin of Henan (\u6cb3\u5357; 525\u2013554)\n\n\u2022 Princess Xiangyang (\u8944\u967d\u516c\u4e3b), fifth daughter\n\n\u2022 Married Dou Yi of Henan, Duke Shenwu (\u6cb3\u5357 \u7ac7\u6bc5; 519\u2013583), and had issue (two sons, two daughters), their daughter Lady Dou would later become the wife of Li Yuan, the founding Emperor of the Tang Dynasty\n\n\u2022 Princess Yi'an (\u7fa9\u5b89\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Li Hui of Liaodong, Duke Wei (\u907c\u6771 \u674e\u6689)\n\n\u2022 Princess Shunyang (\u9806\u967d\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Yang Zan (\u694a\u74da; 550\u2013591)\n\n\u2022 Princess Pingyuan (\u5e73\u539f\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Yu Yi of Henan, Duke Ren (\u6cb3\u5357 \u65bc\u7ffc; d. 583), and had issue (three sons)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yongfu (\u6c38\u5bcc\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Shi Xiong (\u53f2\u96c4)\n\n\u2022 Princess Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Liu Chang, Duke Peng (\u5289\u6636; d. 597)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yigui (\u7fa9\u6b78\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Li Ji, Duke Qinghe (\u674e\u57fa; 531\u2013561), and had issue (one son)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yidu (\u5b9c\u90fd\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Liang Rui, Duke Jiang (\u6881\u777f; 531\u2013595)\n\n\u2022 Princess Deguang (\u5fb7\u5ee3\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Zhao Yongguo of Tianshui (\u5929\u6c34 \u8d99\u6c38\u570b; d. 557)\n\n\u2022 A daughter who married Heba Wei, Duke Huo (\u8cc0\u62d4\u7def)\n\n\u2022 A daughter who married Ruogan Feng, Duke Xu (\u82e5\u5e72\u9cf3)\n\nAncestry"}], "Emperor Wenxuan was killed in a coup led by the general Yuchi Jiong in 557.": [{"url": "https://ctext.org/datawiki.pl?if=en&res=557104", "page_content": "(\u5b87\u6587\u6cf0 Y\u01d4w\u00e9n T\u00e0i) (507\u2013556), nickname(\u9ed1\u737a), formally(\u5b89\u5b9a\u6587\u516c), later further posthumously honored by Northern Zhou initially as(\u6587\u738b) then as(\u6587\u7687\u5e1d) with the temple name(\u592a\u7956), was the paramount general of the Chinese/Xianbei state Western Wei , a branch successor state of Northern Wei . In 534, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei , seeking to assert power independent of the paramount general Gao Huan , fled to Yuwen's domain, and when Gao subsequently proclaimed Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei emperor, a split of Northern Wei was effected, and when Yuwen subsequently poisoned Emperor Xiaowu to death around the new year 535 and declared his cousin Yuan Baoju emperor (as Emperor Wen), the split was formalized, with the part under Gao's and Emperor Xiaojing's control known as Eastern Wei and the part under Yuwen's and Emperor Wen's control known as Western Wei. For the rest of his life, Yuwen endeavored to make Western Wei, then much weaker than its eastern counterpart, a strong state, and after his death, his son Yuwen Jue seized the throne from Emperor Gong of Western Wei , establishing Northern Zhou.\n\nRead more...: Early career Taking control over western provinces Alliance with Emperor Xiaowu During Emperor Wens reign During Emperors Feis reign During Emperor Gongs reign Family Ancestry\n\nEarly career\n\nYuwen Tai was born in 507, and was a descendant of the last chieftain of the Xianbei Yuwen tribe Yuwen Yidougui, whose tribe was destroyed by Murong Huang, the founding ruler of Former Yan. Yuwen Yidougui's descendants served as generals during Former Yan and its successor state Later Yan. Later, when Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei defeated the Later Yan emperor Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin), Yuwen Tai's great-great-grandfather Yuwen Ling (\u5b87\u6587\u9675) surrendered to Northern Wei, and was relocated to Wuchuan (\u6b66\u5ddd, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). Yuwen Tai's father Yuwen Gong (\u5b87\u6587\u80b1) was known for his ability in battle. In 524, with Northern Wei's northern provinces overrun by agrarian rebels, Wuchuan was being held by one of the major rebels, Poliuhan Baling (\u7834\u516d\u97d3\u62d4\u9675). Yuwen Gong and another local leader, Heba Duba (\u8cc0\u62d4\u5ea6\u62d4), ambushed Poliuhan's general Wei Kegu (\u885b\u53ef\u5b64) and killed Wei, temporarily restoring order. It was probably at this time that Yuwen Tai met and befriended Heba Duba's son Heba Yue (\u8cc0\u62d4\u5cb3). Sometime after this incident, Yuwen Gong and his sons fled to Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71, in modern Baoding, Hebei), and were forced to join the army of another rebel general, Xianyu Xiuli (\u9bae\u4e8e\u4fee\u79ae). Yuwen Gong died in a battle between Xianyu's troops and Northern Wei troops, but Yuwen Tai continued to serve in Xianyu's troops. After Xianyu was killed by his general Yuan Hongye (\u5143\u6d2a\u696d) in 526, another Xianyu general, Ge Rong (\u845b\u69ae), in turn killed Yuan and took over Xianyu's troops, and Yuwen continued to serve Ge. However, he saw that Ge was not a competent leader and considered fleeing with his brothers, but before he could carry out his plans, Ge was defeated by the Northern Wei general Erzhu Rong in 528, and Erzhu forcibly moved Ge's troops to his power base at Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Suspicious of the Yuwen brothers, Erzhu killed Yuwen Tai's older brother Yuwen Luosheng (\u5b87\u6587\u6d1b\u751f), but Yuwen Tai pleaded his case with Erzhu and was spared.\n\nIn 529, the Northern Wei prince Yuan Hao, under support from Liang Dynasty, attacked Emperor Xiaozhuang and seized the capital Luoyang, declaring himself emperor. Emperor Xiaozhuang fled north of the Yellow River, and Erzhu advanced south to aid him, sending Heba Yue, who was then serving under Erzhu, to lead his forward troops. Heba made Yuwen Tai his assistant, and later on, after Erzhu defeated Yuan Hao, allowing Emperor Xiaozhuang to return to Luoyang, Yuwen was created the Viscount of Ningdu.\n\nIn 530, Erzhu Rong sent his nephew Erzhu Tianguang, with Heba and Houmochen Yue (\u4faf\u83ab\u9673\u6085) as assistants, to attack the rebel general Moqi Chounu (\u4e07\u4fdf\u919c\u5974), who then occupied the western provinces. Yuwen continued to serve under Heba. After Erzhu Tianguang defeated Moqi, Yuwen, who contributed in the campaign, was made the governor of Yuan Province (\u539f\u5dde, roughly modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and he was said to have ruled the province with such kindness and faith that the people of the province proclaimed, \"Had we had Governor Yuwen as our governor earlier, how would we have joined the rebellion?\"\n\nLate in 530, apprehensive that Erzhu Rong would eventually seize the throne, Emperor Xiaozhuang ambushed him and killed him in the palace. Subsequently, Erzhu Rong's clan members, led by his nephew Erzhu Zhao and cousin Erzhu Shilong, defeated and killed Emperor Xiaozhuang, first making Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang emperor, and then further replaced Yuan Ye with Emperor Jiemin. In 531, the general Gao Huan rebelled against the Erzhus. Erzhu Tianguang was initially not particularly interested in aiding his Erzhu clan members, but felt compelled to, and he departed Chang'an to head east. While Erzhu Tianguang was away, Yuwen advised Heba to rise against the Erzhus, and Heba did, defeating Erzhu Tianguang's brother Erzhu Xianshou (\u723e\u6731\u986f\u58fd), whom Yuwen subsequently captured, dividing control of the territory with Houmochen. By 532, Gao had defeated the Erzhus and seized much of power, deposing Emperor Jiemin and making Emperor Xiaowu emperor instead. When Gao subsequently tried to intimidate Heba into giving up his territory and reporting to Luoyang, but under the advice of Xue Xiaotong (\u859b\u5b5d\u901a), Heba refused. He made Yuwen his lieutenant, and consulted him on most important matters. In 533, Yuwen volunteered to serve as messenger to Gao in order to observe Gao's abilities, and Heba agreed. When Gao met Yuwen, Gao was impressed by the answers Yuwen had to his questions and wanted to detain Yuwen, but Yuwen left Gao's domain before Gao could seize him. Subsequently, Heba sent Yuwen to confer with Emperor Xiaowu, who was not happy about Gao's hold on power, and Emperor Xiaowu and Heba were able to enter into a secret alliance against Gao. Heba made Yuwen the governor of the key Xia Province (\u590f\u5dde, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi).\n\nTaking control over western provinces\n\nBy this point, Heba Yue, in alliance with Houmochen Yue, controlled almost all of the western provinces. However, one provincial governor, Cao Ni (\u66f9\u6ce5), the governor of Ling Province (\u9748\u5dde, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), was aligned with Gao Huan and refused to follow Heba's orders. Heba Yue sent his assistant Zhao Gui (\u8d99\u8cb4) to Xia Province to request Yuwen's opinions, and Yuwen, believing that Houmochen was unreliable, advised against an attack on Cao and suggested instead that Houmochen be attacked. Heba refused\u2014not realizing that by this point, Gao's messengers had persuaded Houmochen to act against him. Heba and Houmochen rendezvoused at Gaoping (\u9ad8\u5e73, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and then headed north against Cao\u2014but as they advanced, Houmochen tricked Heba into coming to his camp for discussions, and then had his son-in-law Yuan Hongjing (\u5143\u6d2a\u666f) assassinate Heba. Initially, Heba's army was surprised and intimidated, but Houmochen, instead of taking over Heba's army, panicked and fled to Shuiluo (\u6c34\u6d1b, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), while Heba's army, without a central commander, withdrew to Pingliang (\u5e73\u6dbc, also in modern Pingliang). After some internal discussions, the army commanders decided to offer the command to Yuwen Tai, and they sent Du Shuozhou (\u675c\u6714\u5468, later changed his name to Helian Da (\u8d6b\u9023\u9054)) to Xia Province to summon Yuwen Tai. Yuwen agreed, and Du and he quickly headed back toward Heba's army. (On the way, they encountered Gao's general Hou Jing, whom Gao had sent to try to take over Heba's army; Hou, surprised, withdrew to Gao's territory quickly.)\n\nEmperor Xiaowu, hearing of Heba's death, sent Yuan Pi (\u5143\u6bd7) to summon both Yuwen and Houmochen to the Luoyang. Houmochen outright refused, and Yuwen persuaded Emperor Xiaowu to allow him to remain in command. Emperor Xiaowu agreed. Yuwen next sent a letter to Houmochen to rebuke him, and when Houmochen did not answer, prepared to launch an attack on Houmochen. He advanced quickly on Shuiluo, and Houmochen withdrew to L\u00fceyang (\u7565\u967d, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), and then to Shanggui (\u4e0a\u90bd, also in modern Tianshui). He then further withdrew from Shanggui, and Shanggui surrendered to Yuwen. He decided to try to flee to Cao's territory, but on the way, believing that Yuwen's forces were close, committed suicide.\n\nAlliance with Emperor Xiaowu\n\nGao Huan made an overture of alliance to Yuwen Tai, but Yuwen refused, instead arresting Gao's messengers and delivering them to Emperor Xiaowu. Emperor Xiaowu authorized him to take over Heba's authorities in the west and created him the Duke of L\u00fceyang.\n\nMeanwhile, Emperor Xiaowu prepared for an attack on Gao, but meanwhile claimed to Gao that he was preparing to attack Yuwen and Heba Yue's brother Heba Sheng (\u8cc0\u62d4\u52dd), who controlled the southern provinces. Gao saw through Emperor Xiaowu's trick, and in summer 534, he instead advanced south toward Luoyang. Emperor Xiaowu's associate Wang Sizheng (\u738b\u601d\u653f), believing that imperial forces would not be able to withstand an attack from Gao, suggested fleeing to Yuwen's domain\u2014despite his own reservations about Yuwen's intentions. Emperor Xiaowu agreed, but at the same time summoned Heba Sheng. However, Heba Sheng did not arrive at Luoyang, while Yuwen sent forces east, commanded by Li Xian (\u674e\u8ce2), to welcome Emperor Xiaowu. In fall 534, before Gao's forces arrived, Emperor Xiaowu fled west, meeting Li on the way. Li escorted Emperor Xiaowu back to Yuwen's headquarters at Chang'an, and Emperor Xiaowu reestablished the imperial government there. He made Yuwen his commander in chief, and married his sister Princess Pingyi\uff08\u51af\u7fca\u516c\u4e3b\uff09 to Yuwen.\n\nAfter Gao entered Luoyang, he sent messengers to request Emperor Xiaowu to return to Luoyang. When Emperor Xiaowu ignored his request, Gao made his distant nephew, Yuan Shanjian, emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), dividing Northern Wei into two, with Eastern Wei recognizing Emperor Xiaojing, and Western Wei recognizing Emperor Xiaowu.\n\nYuwen's relationship with Emperor Xiaowu, however, soon deteriorated. Emperor Xiaowu had engaged in incestuous relationships with three of his cousins, at least one of whom, Yuan Mingyue (\u5143\u660e\u6708) the Princess Pingyuan, followed him to Chang'an. Yuwen disapproved of the relationship, and he persuaded the imperial princes to arrest Yuan Mingyue and put her to death. Emperor Xiaowu became angry, and he often showed his displeasure by tightening his bow or by pounding his table in the palace. Around the new year 535, Yuwen poisoned him to death and made his cousin Yuan Baoju the Prince of Nanyang (Yuan Mingyue's brother) emperor (as Emperor Wen).\n\nDuring Emperor Wens reign\n\nWestern Wei was, initially, the smaller and the weaker of the two successor states of Northern Wei, and early in its existence, there were questions on whether it would survive at all. Yuwen Tai spent much of his effort on preserving existence of Western Wei against repeated attacks led by Gao Huan. He also gradually began to show a trend of following both ancient Chinese customs, as largely encapsulated by the governmental structures of Zhou Dynasty, and restoring Xianbei customs that had largely been abolished by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. In this, he was assisted by the official Su Chuo (\u8607\u7dbd). He also worked on earning the respect of other officials and generals, including Emperor Xiaowu's confidant Wang Sizheng and Pei Xia (\u88f4\u4fe0), both of whom had initially been suspicious of Yuwen and yet later became important and faithful generals serving under him.\n\nIn spring 537, Gao Huan and his generals Dou Tai (\u7ac7\u6cf0) and Gao Aocao (\u9ad8\u6556\u66f9) launched a major attack on Western Wei. Yuwen, correctly judging that Gao Huan was trying to draw Yuwen toward him while allowing Dou to penetrate Western Wei defenses, announced that he was going to lead a withdraw to modern eastern Gansu but instead made a surprise attack on Dou's army at Xiaoguan (\u5c0f\u95dc, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), crushing Dou's forces. Dou committed suicide in shame. Gao Huan and Gao Aocao were forced to withdraw. In fall 537, Yuwen led an attack on Eastern Wei and captured Hengnong (\u6046\u8fb2, in modern Sanmenxia as well). With Western Wei's capital region Guanzhong suffering from a famine, Yuwen remained in Hengnong to collect food from the area, but then heard that Gao Huan was again launching another attack from the northeast, forcing him to return to the Guanzhong region. The forces engaged at Shawan (\u6c99\u82d1, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), after Gao rejected advice from his general Hul\u00fc Qiangju (\u659b\u5f8b\u7f8c\u8209) to directly attack the Western Wei capital Chang'an. Despite Eastern Wei's numerical superiority, Yuwen's forces crushed Gao's forces, and Gao was forced to withdraw. In winter 537, the Western Wei general Dugu Xin captured the former Northern Wei capital Luoyang, and several other nearby provinces also surrendered to Western Wei.\n\nIn spring 538, in order to create an alliance with Rouran, Yuwen first had Emperor Wen bestow the title of Princess Huazheng to Yuan Yi (\u5143\u7fcc), the daughter of a member of the imperial clan, to marry her to Yujiul\u00fc Tahan (\u90c1\u4e45\u95ad\u5854\u5bd2), the brother of Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiul\u00fc Anagui. But Yuwen, believing that to be insufficient, requested Emperor Wen divorce his wife Empress Yifu and marry Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen was forced to agree, and he deposed Empress Yifu, ordering her to become a Buddhist nun, and married Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter as empress. (In 540, under Rouran pressure, Empress Yifu would be forced to commit suicide.)\n\nBy summer 538, however, Eastern Wei generals Hou Jing and Gao Aocao had surrounded Luoyang. Yuwen and Emperor Wen proceeded to Luoyang to try to lift the siege. When Yuwen arrived, Hou and Gao initially lifted the siege on Luoyang, but when Yuwen chased after them, his horse was shot by an arrow, and he fell off his horse and was nearly captured, but both he and his general Li Mu (\u674e\u7a46) pretended to be common soldiers and were able to escape. Once Yuwen returned to Western Wei camp, Western Wei forces again attacked and killed Gao. Later that day, however, an Eastern Wei counterattack inflicted major losses on Western Wei forces, forcing Yuwen to withdraw and rendezvous with Emperor Wen at Hengnong. Meanwhile, however, Eastern Wei captives in Chang'an heard of the Western Wei defeat and rebelled within the city, led by the general Zhao Qingque (\u8d99\u9752\u96c0), forcing the official Zhou Huida (\u5468\u60e0\u9054), who had been left in charge of Chang'an, to flee the city with the crown prince Yuan Qin. Under the advice of Lu Tong (\u9678\u901a), Yuwen quickly returned west and defeated Zhao, suppressing his rebellion. Around this time, Yuwen also started setting up his headquarters at Hua Province (\u83ef\u5dde, roughly modern Weinan), not far from Chang'an but maintaining some distance from the capital, incorporate many talented officials and generals into his staff. He further established a night school for the junior officers and officials in his administration at Hua Province.\n\nIn 541, under Su's suggestion, Yuwen had Emperor Wen issue an edict outlining six principles of government, intending to reduce corruption and wastefulness and strengthen the economy:\n\n\u2022 Qingxinsi (\u6e05\u5fc3\u601d) -- ordering the officials to clean their hearts and not desire many things.\n\n\u2022 Dunjiaohua (\u6566\u6559\u5316) -- instituting a regime of moral education.\n\n\u2022 Jindili (\u76e1\u5730\u5229) -- the concept of encouraging agriculture and maximizing the utility of the land.\n\n\u2022 Zhuoxianliang (\u64e2\u8ce2\u826f) -- finding capable individuals to promote, regardless of their family backgrounds.\n\n\u2022 Xuyusong (\u6064\u7344\u8a1f) -- forbidding torture and instituting the concept that it would be preferable to let the guilty go than to punish an innocent.\n\n\u2022 Junfuyi (\u5747\u8ce6\u5f79) -- the concept that tax and labor burdens must be fair, and that powerful families may not avoid them.\n\nYuwen ordered that all of the officials of the state must study the six principles and further be able to balance budgets, at the pain of being relieved from their offices.\n\nIn spring 543, the Eastern Wei official Gao Zhongmi (\u9ad8\u4ef2\u5bc6), the governor of North Yu Province (\u5317\u8c6b\u5dde, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan), angry that Gao Huan's son Gao Cheng had tried to rape his second wife, and in a dispute with Gao Cheng's assistant Cui Xian (\u5d14\u66b9) over his having divorced Cui's sister, rebelled and surrendered his headquarters of Hulao (\u864e\u7262, in modern Zhengzhou) to Western Wei. Yuwen personally led troops to try to save Gao Zhongmi. At Luoyang, however, he was defeated by the Eastern Wei general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) and was nearly captured, only managing to elude capture by throwing gold at Peng to bribe him and persuade him that if he captured Yuwen, he would be no longer any use to Gao Huan. The next day, a Western Wei counterattack in turn almost killed Gao Huan, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Yuwen was forced to withdraw, but against advice from Feng Zihui (\u5c01\u5b50\u7e6a) and Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Gao Huan failed to chase Yuwen and allowed him to escape. The defeat was considered so major that Yuwen offered to have his rank reduced, but Emperor Wen did not accept the request.\n\nIn 545, Yuwen, seeing that one of Rouran's vassals, Tujue, was growing in strength, sent a messenger, Annuo Pantuo (\u5b89\u8afe\u69c3\u9640) to Tujue to greet its chief Ashina Tumen, to try to establish friendly relations.\n\nIn 546, Gao Huan launched another major attack on Western Wei, putting Yubi (\u7389\u58c1, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) under siege, intending to draw Western Wei forces to try to save Yubi, but Yuwen took no reaction to it, instead leaving Yubi's defense to the general Wei Xiaokuan. Wei ably defended Yubi, draining the strength of the Eastern Wei forces, and as Gao grew ill, Eastern Wei forces were forced to withdraw with major losses.\n\nLater in 546, Su died. Yuwen mourned him greatly, and personally attended Su's burial, crying bitterly.\n\nIn spring 547, the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing, who was in charge of Eastern Wei provinces south of the Yellow River, believing that Gao Huan had died (indeed, Gao had, although his son Gao Cheng was keeping the death a secret) and not willing to submit to Gao Cheng, surrendered the provinces initially to Western Wei and then to Liang. Yuwen conferred honorary titles on Hou, but was initially unwilling to send relief troops. With Wang Sizheng advocating taking four provinces that Hou offered in exchange for aid, however, Yuwen sent Li Bi (\u674e\u5f3c) and Zhao Gui to assist Wang, initially forcing Eastern Wei forces attacking Hou to withdraw. Soon, however, Western Wei generals and Hou began to suspect each other, and after Yuwen ordered Hou to proceed to Chang'an to greet Emperor Wen and Hou refused, the sides officially broke, and the Western Wei generals held onto the four provinces without rendering further aid to Hou, who from that point on depending solely on Liang aid. (Later that year, however, the Eastern Wei general Murong Shaozong (\u6155\u5bb9\u7d39\u5b97) would crush Liang forces commanded by Xiao Yuanming, the nephew of Emperor Wu of Liang, capturing Xiao Yuanming, and then in early 548 defeat Hou and force him to flee to Liang, taking all of the provinces back except the four that Western Wei had taken.)\n\nIn summer 548, Yuwen and Yuan Qin the Crown Prince carried out a tour of Western Wei's border provinces, but upon hearing that Emperor Wen was ill, cut their tour short and returned to Chang'an. However, when they did, Emperor Wen had already been healed, and Yuwen thereafter returned to his headquarters at Hua Province.\n\nAround the same time, the Eastern Wei general Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3, Gao Huan's cousin) launched an attack on Yingchuan (\u6f41\u5ddd, in modern Xuchang, Henan), one of the major cities that Western Wei took from Hou. Wang, defending Yingchuan, initially repelled Eastern Wei's attacks, but with Eastern Wei diverting Wei River (\u6d27\u6c34) to flood Yingchuan, it was in the danger of falling. Yuwen sent Zhao to try to lift the siege, but Zhao was impeded by the water and was unable to proceed to Yingchuan. A counterattack by Wang, however, killed Murong Shaozong and Liu Fengsheng (\u5289\u8c50\u751f), temporarily relieving the pressure on Yingchuan. Gao Cheng himself reinforced Gao Yue's army, and by summer 549 captured Yingchuan, taking Wang captive. With Yingchuan having fallen, Yuwen ordered a general withdrawal from the area, and the provinces taken from Hou were retaken by Eastern Wei.\n\nMeanwhile, with Hou having rebelled against Liang's Emperor Wu in 548 and captured the Liang capital Jiankang in 549, Liang was in disarray, with Hou and the various imperial princes and governors fighting for control. By winter 549, one of the Liang princes, Xiao Cha the Prince of Yueyang (Emperor Wu's grandson), fearing an attack from his uncle Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong (Emperor Wu's son), surrendered his domain around the city Xiangyang (\u8944\u967d, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) to Western Wei, requesting protection. Yuwen sent the general Yang Zhong (\u694a\u5fe0) to aid Xiao Cha, and after Yang defeated and captured Xiao Yi's general Liu Zhongli (\u67f3\u4ef2\u79ae) in spring 550, Western Wei made peace with Xiao Yi, setting the borders in such a way to put Xiao Cha under Western Wei's protection. Yuwen created Xiao Cha the title \"Prince of Liang,\" preparing to have him claim the Liang throne as Western Wei's vassal.\n\nIn summer 550, Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang, who had controlled the Eastern Wei government after Gao Cheng's death in 549, forced Eastern Wei's Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). In response, Yuwen launched a major attack on the newly established Northern Qi, reaching Jian Province (\u5efa\u5dde, roughly modern Jincheng, Shanxi). However, Gao Yang himself led a strong army to defend against Yuwen's attack, and Yuwen, upon hearing that Gao Yang's army was well-run, made the comment, \"Alas, Gao Huan is not dead.\" Meanwhile, due to rains, the livestock that Western Wei forces relied on were dying in large numbers, and so Yuwen was forced to retreat. While there appeared to be few casualties, Northern Qi was in turn able to make minor border gains in light of Yuwen's withdrawal.\n\nAround the new year 550, another son of Liang's Emperor Wu, Xiao Guan (\u856d\u7db8) the Prince of Shaoling, attempted to recapture Anlu (\u5b89\u9678, in modern Xiaogan, Hubei), which Yang had earlier captured from Xiao Yi. Yuwen sent Yang to relieve Anlu, and Yang not only did so, but proceeded to siege Xiao Guan's headquarters at Ru'nan (\u6c5d\u5357, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), capturing it and then executing Xiao Guan.\n\nIn spring 551, Emperor Wen died, and Yuan Qin succeeded him (as Emperor Fei).\n\nDuring Emperors Feis reign\n\nYuwen Tai appeared to hold an even firmer grip on power after Emperor Wen's death. Emperor Fei's wife Empress Yuwen was Yuwen Tai's daughter, and while it was recorded that he did not have any concubines because he loved her greatly, it could have also been that he feared Yuwen's power and therefore did not have any concubines.\n\nIn summer 551, the Tiele were launching an attack on Rouran, when Tujue's chieftain Ashina Tumen intercepted the Tiele and captured a large number of the Tiele people. Ashina Tumen, after his victory, sought a marriage with a daughter of Yujiul\u00fc Anagui. Yujiul\u00fc Anagui felt insulted and refused, viewing the Tujue as inferior; in response, Ashina Tumen cut off relations with Rouran. Yuwen took this opportunity to create an alliance with Tujue, sending the Princess Changle to Tujue to marry Ashina Tumen.\n\nIn summer 552, with Xiao Yi and Hou Jing battling each other, Xiao Yi sought help from Western Wei and agreed to cede Nanzheng (\u5357\u912d, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) to Western Wei, but the order was declined by Xiao Yi's cousin, Xiao Xun (\u856d\u5faa). Yuwen and his general Daxi Wu (\u9054\u595a\u6b66) thus attacked Hanzhong. Xiao Xun instead turned to another brother of Xiao Yi, Xiao Ji the Prince of Wuling for aid, and Xiao Ji sent reinforcements commanded by the general Yang Qianyun (\u694a\u4e7e\u904b). Yuwen and Daxi put Nanzheng under siege, and due to the length of the siege, Yuwen and Daxi became angry and ordered that the city be slaughtered when it falls, but at the intercession of Xiao Xun's chief of staff Liu Fan (\u5289\u74a0), whom Western Wei forces captured during the siege and whose talent Yuwen respected, Yuwen rescinded the order. Soon thereafter, Xiao Xun surrendered, and Nanzheng was in Western Wei hands. Yuwen initially agreed to allow Xiao Xun to return to Liang, but instead detained him, releasing him only after Liu again persuaded him to do so, reminding him of his promise. (During the conversation Liu had with Yuwen, Liu commented that he initially thought of Yuwen as Tang of Shang and King Wu of Zhou, but because of his failure to follow his promise, found him to be less than Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin. Yuwen instead compared himself to Yi Yin (\u4f0a\u5c39, a legendary regent of Shang Dynasty) and Duke of Zhou, apparently disavowing intentions on the throne for the time being.)\n\nIn spring 553, with Xiao Ji and Xiao Yi, both of whom having claimed Liang's imperial title after Hou's fall, battling each other, Xiao Yi sought aid from Western Wei, requesting Western Wei to attack Xiao Ji's home base of Chengdu (\u6210\u90fd, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) from the rear. Yuwen sent his nephew Yuchi Jiong to attack Xiao Ji's domain (modern Sichuan and Chongqing). Most of Xiao Ji's domain fell into Western Wei hands, and subsequently, Xiao Ji was defeated and captured by Xiao Yi.\n\nIn winter 553, the imperial official Yuan Lie (\u5143\u70c8) formed a conspiracy to kill Yuwen, but the news leaked. Yuwen killed him. Following Yuan Lie's death, Emperor Fei himself was angry and wanted to kill Yuwen, despite advise from his cousins Yuan Yu (\u5143\u80b2) the Prince of Huaiai and Yuan Zan (\u5143\u8d0a) the Prince of Guangping. However, Emperor Fei's apparent attempt to court the imperial guards became known by the commanders, several of whom were Yuwen's sons-in-law, and Yuwen put Emperor Fei under house arrest and then deposed him, replacing him with his younger brother Yuan Kuo the Prince of Qi (as Emperor Gong). Yuwen took this opportunity to change the Han names for the Xianbei that Emperor Xiaowen had instituted back to the original Xianbei names, including changing the imperial surname Yuan back to Tuoba. Further, because Xianbei legends indicated that originally, the Tuoba tribe had 36 subtribes and 99 subclans, Yuwen chose 36 key Han generals and 99 commanders and changed their names to Xianbei names, to fill out the original names. Yuwen subsequently put the former emperor to death. It was recorded that Empress Yuwen, Yuwen Tai's daughter, also \"suffered death because of her loyalty to Wei,\" but it is not known exactly whether Yuwen killed her.\n\nDuring Emperor Gongs reign\n\nIn spring 554, while on a diplomatic mission to Liang (now with Xiao Yi as its undisputed emperor\u2014as Emperor Yuan), the Western Wei official Yuwen Renshu (\u5b87\u6587\u4ec1\u6055, probably Yuwen Tai's relative but relationship is unclear) was slighted by Emperor Yuan, who treated Northern Qi's ambassador with far greater respect. Emperor Yuan then further aggravated the situation by sending an impolite letter to Yuwen Tai demanding that the borders be redrawn in accordance with old borders. Yuwen made the comment, \"Xiao Yi is the type of person that, as said in proverbs, 'One who has been abandoned by heaven cannot be revived by anyone else.'\" Yuwen Tai therefore began to prepare attacking Emperor Yuan at his headquarters of Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), as Emperor Yuan had made Jiangling his capital and declined to move back to the old capital Jiankang. The Western Wei general Ma Bofu (\u99ac\u4f2f\u7b26), formerly a Liang general, secretly revealed the attack plans to Emperor Yuan, but Emperor Yuan did not believe Ma and took minimal precautions.\n\nIn winter 554, under Yuwen Tai's orders, Western Wei forces, commanded by Yu Jin (\u4e8e\u8b39), who was assisted by Yuwen Tai's nephew Yuwen Hu and Yang Zhong, launched a major attack on Liang. Emperor Yuan initially did not take reports of the Western Wei attack seriously, and while he summoned his major generals Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin from afar, he himself took little defensive or evasive actions. Yu quickly descended on Jiangling and put it under siege. Soon, Emperor Yuan surrendered, and Western Wei forces gave him to Xiao Cha to be executed. Western Wei created Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (as Emperor Xuan) and gave him the Jiangling area (known in history as Western Liang) in exchange for his old domain of Xiangyang area, which Western Wei took control directly. (However, the rest of Liang did not recognize Emperor Xuan, and soon recognized a rival candidate for the throne supported by Northern Qi, Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming.) Most residents of Jiangling were seized as slaves, although eventually most of them were released by Yuwen after he was persuaded to do so by one of the captives, the Liang official Yu Jicai (\u5ebe\u5b63\u624d).\n\nAround the near year 556, after Tujue's Mugan Khan Ashina Qijin thoroughly crushed Rouran's last khan Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi, Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi fled to Western Wei. Ashina Qijin demanded the execution of Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi, and Yuwen Tai, fearing a Tujue attack, turned Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi and 3000 of his followers to the Tujue ambassadors, who slaughtered them.\n\nAlso around the new year 556, Yuwen Tai promulgated a new government structure, dividing the government into six ministries, based on the Zhou Dynasty model. (This structure was initially devised by Su Chuo, and after Su Chuo's death, Yuwen had it further revised by Lu Bian (\u76e7\u8faf).) He also had Tuoba Yu the Prince of Huai'an submit a request, and then have Emperor Gong formally approve the request, to have all imperial princes reduced in rank to dukes, in accordance with the Zhou tradition.\n\nIn spring 556, Yuwen was pondering the issue of succession. His wife Princess Pingyi had one son, Yuwen Jue, but his oldest son, Yuwen Yu, was born of his concubine Lady Yao, and was married to the daughter of one of his chief generals, Dugu Xin. On the advice of Li Yuan (\u674e\u9060), who argued that the son of a wife always had precedence over the son of a concubine, Yuwen Tai made Yuwen Jue his heir apparent.\n\nin fall 556, while Yuwen Tai was on a tour of the norther provinces, he became ill at Qiantun Mountain (\u727d\u5c6f\u5c71, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia). He summoned his nephew Yuwen Hu to Qiantun and entrusted the affairs of the state as well as his sons to Yuwen Hu. He soon died, and Yuwen Jue took over his titles, while Yuwen Hu took the reins of the state, and under Yuwen Hu's tutelage, Yuwen Jue soon took the throne from Emperor Gong, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Wen, of the Yuan clan of Henan (\u6587\u7687\u540e \u6cb3\u5357\u5143\u6c0f; d. 551)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Jue, Emperor Xiaomin (\u5b5d\u9594\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u89ba; 542\u2013557), third son\n\n\u2022 Empress Xuan, of the Chinu clan (\u5ba3\u7687\u540e \u53f1\u5974\u6c0f; d. 574)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Yong, Emperor Wu (\u6b66\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u9095; 543\u2013578), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhi, Prince Weila (\u885b\u524c\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u76f4; d. 574), sixth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yao clan (\u592b\u4eba \u59da\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Yu, Emperor Ming (\u660e\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u6bd3; 534\u2013560), first son\n\n\u2022 Fei, of the Dabugan clan (\u5983 \u9054\u6b65\u5e79\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Xian, Prince Qiyang (\u9f4a\u716c\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u61b2; 545\u2013578), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Quan clan (\u592b\u4eba \u6b0a\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Jian, Prince Qiaoxiao (\u8b59\u5b5d\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u5109; 551\u2013578), eighth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Wuliuhun clan (\u592b\u4eba \u70cf\u516d\u6e3e\u6c0f), personal name Xianyu (\u986f\u7389)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Tong, Prince Jikang (\u5180\u5eb7\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u901a; 555\u2013571), 12th son\n\n\u2022 Lady, of the Wang clan (\u738b\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhao, Prince Zhaojian (\u8d99\u50ed\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u62db; d. 581), seventh son\n\n\u2022 Lady, of the Zhang clan (\u5f35\u6c0f), personal name N\u00fcbi (\u5973\u7562)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Da, Prince Daibi (\u4ee3\u5970\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u9054; d. 581), 11th son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhen, Duke Songxian (\u5b8b\u737b\u516c \u5b87\u6587\u9707; d. 550), second son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Chun, Prince Chenhuo (\u9673\u60d1\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u7d14; d. 581), ninth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Sheng, Prince Yueye (\u8d8a\u91ce\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u76db; d. 581), tenth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen You, Prince Tengwen (\u6ed5\u805e\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u900c; 556\u2013581), 13th son\n\n\u2022 First daughter (d. 554)\n\n\u2022 Married Yuan Qin of Henan (\u6cb3\u5357; 525\u2013554)\n\n\u2022 Princess Xiangyang (\u8944\u967d\u516c\u4e3b), fifth daughter\n\n\u2022 Married Dou Yi of Henan, Duke Shenwu (\u6cb3\u5357 \u7ac7\u6bc5; 519\u2013583), and had issue (two sons, two daughters), their daughter Lady Dou would later become the wife of Li Yuan, the founding Emperor of the Tang Dynasty\n\n\u2022 Princess Yi'an (\u7fa9\u5b89\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Li Hui of Liaodong, Duke Wei (\u907c\u6771 \u674e\u6689)\n\n\u2022 Princess Shunyang (\u9806\u967d\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Yang Zan (\u694a\u74da; 550\u2013591)\n\n\u2022 Princess Pingyuan (\u5e73\u539f\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Yu Yi of Henan, Duke Ren (\u6cb3\u5357 \u65bc\u7ffc; d. 583), and had issue (three sons)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yongfu (\u6c38\u5bcc\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Shi Xiong (\u53f2\u96c4)\n\n\u2022 Princess Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Liu Chang, Duke Peng (\u5289\u6636; d. 597)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yigui (\u7fa9\u6b78\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Li Ji, Duke Qinghe (\u674e\u57fa; 531\u2013561), and had issue (one son)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yidu (\u5b9c\u90fd\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Liang Rui, Duke Jiang (\u6881\u777f; 531\u2013595)\n\n\u2022 Princess Deguang (\u5fb7\u5ee3\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Zhao Yongguo of Tianshui (\u5929\u6c34 \u8d99\u6c38\u570b; d. 557)\n\n\u2022 A daughter who married Heba Wei, Duke Huo (\u8cc0\u62d4\u7def)\n\n\u2022 A daughter who married Ruogan Feng, Duke Xu (\u82e5\u5e72\u9cf3)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://ctext.org/datawiki.pl?if=en&res=557104&remap=gb", "page_content": "(\u5b87\u6587\u6cf0 Y\u01d4w\u00e9n T\u00e0i) (507\u2013556), nickname(\u9ed1\u736d), formally(\u5b89\u5b9a\u6587\u516c), later further posthumously honored by Northern Zhou initially as(\u6587\u738b) then as(\u6587\u7687\u5e1d) with the temple name(\u592a\u7956), was the paramount general of the Chinese/Xianbei state Western Wei , a branch successor state of Northern Wei . In 534, Emperor Xiaowu of Northern Wei , seeking to assert power independent of the paramount general Gao Huan , fled to Yuwen's domain, and when Gao subsequently proclaimed Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei emperor, a split of Northern Wei was effected, and when Yuwen subsequently poisoned Emperor Xiaowu to death around the new year 535 and declared his cousin Yuan Baoju emperor (as Emperor Wen), the split was formalized, with the part under Gao's and Emperor Xiaojing's control known as Eastern Wei and the part under Yuwen's and Emperor Wen's control known as Western Wei. For the rest of his life, Yuwen endeavored to make Western Wei, then much weaker than its eastern counterpart, a strong state, and after his death, his son Yuwen Jue seized the throne from Emperor Gong of Western Wei , establishing Northern Zhou.\n\nRead more...: Early career Taking control over western provinces Alliance with Emperor Xiaowu During Emperor Wens reign During Emperors Feis reign During Emperor Gongs reign Family Ancestry\n\nEarly career\n\nYuwen Tai was born in 507, and was a descendant of the last chieftain of the Xianbei Yuwen tribe Yuwen Yidougui, whose tribe was destroyed by Murong Huang, the founding ruler of Former Yan. Yuwen Yidougui's descendants served as generals during Former Yan and its successor state Later Yan. Later, when Emperor Daowu of Northern Wei defeated the Later Yan emperor Murong Bao (Emperor Huimin), Yuwen Tai's great-great-grandfather Yuwen Ling (\u5b87\u6587\u9675) surrendered to Northern Wei, and was relocated to Wuchuan (\u6b66\u5ddd, in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia). Yuwen Tai's father Yuwen Gong (\u5b87\u6587\u80b1) was known for his ability in battle. In 524, with Northern Wei's northern provinces overrun by agrarian rebels, Wuchuan was being held by one of the major rebels, Poliuhan Baling (\u7834\u516d\u97e9\u62d4\u9675). Yuwen Gong and another local leader, Heba Duba (\u8d3a\u62d4\u5ea6\u62d4), ambushed Poliuhan's general Wei Kegu (\u536b\u53ef\u5b64) and killed Wei, temporarily restoring order. It was probably at this time that Yuwen Tai met and befriended Heba Duba's son Heba Yue (\u8d3a\u62d4\u5cb3). Sometime after this incident, Yuwen Gong and his sons fled to Zhongshan (\u4e2d\u5c71, in modern Baoding, Hebei), and were forced to join the army of another rebel general, Xianyu Xiuli (\u9c9c\u4e8e\u4fee\u793c). Yuwen Gong died in a battle between Xianyu's troops and Northern Wei troops, but Yuwen Tai continued to serve in Xianyu's troops. After Xianyu was killed by his general Yuan Hongye (\u5143\u6d2a\u4e1a) in 526, another Xianyu general, Ge Rong (\u845b\u8363), in turn killed Yuan and took over Xianyu's troops, and Yuwen continued to serve Ge. However, he saw that Ge was not a competent leader and considered fleeing with his brothers, but before he could carry out his plans, Ge was defeated by the Northern Wei general Erzhu Rong in 528, and Erzhu forcibly moved Ge's troops to his power base at Jinyang (\u664b\u9633, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Suspicious of the Yuwen brothers, Erzhu killed Yuwen Tai's older brother Yuwen Luosheng (\u5b87\u6587\u6d1b\u751f), but Yuwen Tai pleaded his case with Erzhu and was spared.\n\nIn 529, the Northern Wei prince Yuan Hao, under support from Liang Dynasty, attacked Emperor Xiaozhuang and seized the capital Luoyang, declaring himself emperor. Emperor Xiaozhuang fled north of the Yellow River, and Erzhu advanced south to aid him, sending Heba Yue, who was then serving under Erzhu, to lead his forward troops. Heba made Yuwen Tai his assistant, and later on, after Erzhu defeated Yuan Hao, allowing Emperor Xiaozhuang to return to Luoyang, Yuwen was created the Viscount of Ningdu.\n\nIn 530, Erzhu Rong sent his nephew Erzhu Tianguang, with Heba and Houmochen Yue (\u4faf\u83ab\u9648\u60a6) as assistants, to attack the rebel general Moqi Chounu (\u4e07\u4fdf\u4e11\u5974), who then occupied the western provinces. Yuwen continued to serve under Heba. After Erzhu Tianguang defeated Moqi, Yuwen, who contributed in the campaign, was made the governor of Yuan Province (\u539f\u5dde, roughly modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and he was said to have ruled the province with such kindness and faith that the people of the province proclaimed, \"Had we had Governor Yuwen as our governor earlier, how would we have joined the rebellion?\"\n\nLate in 530, apprehensive that Erzhu Rong would eventually seize the throne, Emperor Xiaozhuang ambushed him and killed him in the palace. Subsequently, Erzhu Rong's clan members, led by his nephew Erzhu Zhao and cousin Erzhu Shilong, defeated and killed Emperor Xiaozhuang, first making Yuan Ye the Prince of Changguang emperor, and then further replaced Yuan Ye with Emperor Jiemin. In 531, the general Gao Huan rebelled against the Erzhus. Erzhu Tianguang was initially not particularly interested in aiding his Erzhu clan members, but felt compelled to, and he departed Chang'an to head east. While Erzhu Tianguang was away, Yuwen advised Heba to rise against the Erzhus, and Heba did, defeating Erzhu Tianguang's brother Erzhu Xianshou (\u5c14\u6731\u663e\u5bff), whom Yuwen subsequently captured, dividing control of the territory with Houmochen. By 532, Gao had defeated the Erzhus and seized much of power, deposing Emperor Jiemin and making Emperor Xiaowu emperor instead. When Gao subsequently tried to intimidate Heba into giving up his territory and reporting to Luoyang, but under the advice of Xue Xiaotong (\u859b\u5b5d\u901a), Heba refused. He made Yuwen his lieutenant, and consulted him on most important matters. In 533, Yuwen volunteered to serve as messenger to Gao in order to observe Gao's abilities, and Heba agreed. When Gao met Yuwen, Gao was impressed by the answers Yuwen had to his questions and wanted to detain Yuwen, but Yuwen left Gao's domain before Gao could seize him. Subsequently, Heba sent Yuwen to confer with Emperor Xiaowu, who was not happy about Gao's hold on power, and Emperor Xiaowu and Heba were able to enter into a secret alliance against Gao. Heba made Yuwen the governor of the key Xia Province (\u590f\u5dde, roughly modern Yulin, Shaanxi).\n\nTaking control over western provinces\n\nBy this point, Heba Yue, in alliance with Houmochen Yue, controlled almost all of the western provinces. However, one provincial governor, Cao Ni (\u66f9\u6ce5), the governor of Ling Province (\u7075\u5dde, roughly modern Yinchuan, Ningxia), was aligned with Gao Huan and refused to follow Heba's orders. Heba Yue sent his assistant Zhao Gui (\u8d75\u8d35) to Xia Province to request Yuwen's opinions, and Yuwen, believing that Houmochen was unreliable, advised against an attack on Cao and suggested instead that Houmochen be attacked. Heba refused\u2014not realizing that by this point, Gao's messengers had persuaded Houmochen to act against him. Heba and Houmochen rendezvoused at Gaoping (\u9ad8\u5e73, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia), and then headed north against Cao\u2014but as they advanced, Houmochen tricked Heba into coming to his camp for discussions, and then had his son-in-law Yuan Hongjing (\u5143\u6d2a\u666f) assassinate Heba. Initially, Heba's army was surprised and intimidated, but Houmochen, instead of taking over Heba's army, panicked and fled to Shuiluo (\u6c34\u6d1b, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), while Heba's army, without a central commander, withdrew to Pingliang (\u5e73\u51c9, also in modern Pingliang). After some internal discussions, the army commanders decided to offer the command to Yuwen Tai, and they sent Du Shuozhou (\u675c\u6714\u5468, later changed his name to Helian Da (\u8d6b\u8fde\u8fbe)) to Xia Province to summon Yuwen Tai. Yuwen agreed, and Du and he quickly headed back toward Heba's army. (On the way, they encountered Gao's general Hou Jing, whom Gao had sent to try to take over Heba's army; Hou, surprised, withdrew to Gao's territory quickly.)\n\nEmperor Xiaowu, hearing of Heba's death, sent Yuan Pi (\u5143\u6bd7) to summon both Yuwen and Houmochen to the Luoyang. Houmochen outright refused, and Yuwen persuaded Emperor Xiaowu to allow him to remain in command. Emperor Xiaowu agreed. Yuwen next sent a letter to Houmochen to rebuke him, and when Houmochen did not answer, prepared to launch an attack on Houmochen. He advanced quickly on Shuiluo, and Houmochen withdrew to L\u00fceyang (\u7565\u9633, in modern Tianshui, Gansu), and then to Shanggui (\u4e0a\u90bd, also in modern Tianshui). He then further withdrew from Shanggui, and Shanggui surrendered to Yuwen. He decided to try to flee to Cao's territory, but on the way, believing that Yuwen's forces were close, committed suicide.\n\nAlliance with Emperor Xiaowu\n\nGao Huan made an overture of alliance to Yuwen Tai, but Yuwen refused, instead arresting Gao's messengers and delivering them to Emperor Xiaowu. Emperor Xiaowu authorized him to take over Heba's authorities in the west and created him the Duke of L\u00fceyang.\n\nMeanwhile, Emperor Xiaowu prepared for an attack on Gao, but meanwhile claimed to Gao that he was preparing to attack Yuwen and Heba Yue's brother Heba Sheng (\u8d3a\u62d4\u80dc), who controlled the southern provinces. Gao saw through Emperor Xiaowu's trick, and in summer 534, he instead advanced south toward Luoyang. Emperor Xiaowu's associate Wang Sizheng (\u738b\u601d\u653f), believing that imperial forces would not be able to withstand an attack from Gao, suggested fleeing to Yuwen's domain\u2014despite his own reservations about Yuwen's intentions. Emperor Xiaowu agreed, but at the same time summoned Heba Sheng. However, Heba Sheng did not arrive at Luoyang, while Yuwen sent forces east, commanded by Li Xian (\u674e\u8d24), to welcome Emperor Xiaowu. In fall 534, before Gao's forces arrived, Emperor Xiaowu fled west, meeting Li on the way. Li escorted Emperor Xiaowu back to Yuwen's headquarters at Chang'an, and Emperor Xiaowu reestablished the imperial government there. He made Yuwen his commander in chief, and married his sister Princess Pingyi\uff08\u51af\u7fca\u516c\u4e3b\uff09 to Yuwen.\n\nAfter Gao entered Luoyang, he sent messengers to request Emperor Xiaowu to return to Luoyang. When Emperor Xiaowu ignored his request, Gao made his distant nephew, Yuan Shanjian, emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), dividing Northern Wei into two, with Eastern Wei recognizing Emperor Xiaojing, and Western Wei recognizing Emperor Xiaowu.\n\nYuwen's relationship with Emperor Xiaowu, however, soon deteriorated. Emperor Xiaowu had engaged in incestuous relationships with three of his cousins, at least one of whom, Yuan Mingyue (\u5143\u660e\u6708) the Princess Pingyuan, followed him to Chang'an. Yuwen disapproved of the relationship, and he persuaded the imperial princes to arrest Yuan Mingyue and put her to death. Emperor Xiaowu became angry, and he often showed his displeasure by tightening his bow or by pounding his table in the palace. Around the new year 535, Yuwen poisoned him to death and made his cousin Yuan Baoju the Prince of Nanyang (Yuan Mingyue's brother) emperor (as Emperor Wen).\n\nDuring Emperor Wens reign\n\nWestern Wei was, initially, the smaller and the weaker of the two successor states of Northern Wei, and early in its existence, there were questions on whether it would survive at all. Yuwen Tai spent much of his effort on preserving existence of Western Wei against repeated attacks led by Gao Huan. He also gradually began to show a trend of following both ancient Chinese customs, as largely encapsulated by the governmental structures of Zhou Dynasty, and restoring Xianbei customs that had largely been abolished by Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. In this, he was assisted by the official Su Chuo (\u82cf\u7ef0). He also worked on earning the respect of other officials and generals, including Emperor Xiaowu's confidant Wang Sizheng and Pei Xia (\u88f4\u4fa0), both of whom had initially been suspicious of Yuwen and yet later became important and faithful generals serving under him.\n\nIn spring 537, Gao Huan and his generals Dou Tai (\u7aa6\u6cf0) and Gao Aocao (\u9ad8\u6556\u66f9) launched a major attack on Western Wei. Yuwen, correctly judging that Gao Huan was trying to draw Yuwen toward him while allowing Dou to penetrate Western Wei defenses, announced that he was going to lead a withdraw to modern eastern Gansu but instead made a surprise attack on Dou's army at Xiaoguan (\u5c0f\u5173, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan), crushing Dou's forces. Dou committed suicide in shame. Gao Huan and Gao Aocao were forced to withdraw. In fall 537, Yuwen led an attack on Eastern Wei and captured Hengnong (\u6052\u519c, in modern Sanmenxia as well). With Western Wei's capital region Guanzhong suffering from a famine, Yuwen remained in Hengnong to collect food from the area, but then heard that Gao Huan was again launching another attack from the northeast, forcing him to return to the Guanzhong region. The forces engaged at Shawan (\u6c99\u82d1, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), after Gao rejected advice from his general Hul\u00fc Qiangju (\u659b\u5f8b\u7f8c\u4e3e) to directly attack the Western Wei capital Chang'an. Despite Eastern Wei's numerical superiority, Yuwen's forces crushed Gao's forces, and Gao was forced to withdraw. In winter 537, the Western Wei general Dugu Xin captured the former Northern Wei capital Luoyang, and several other nearby provinces also surrendered to Western Wei.\n\nIn spring 538, in order to create an alliance with Rouran, Yuwen first had Emperor Wen bestow the title of Princess Huazheng to Yuan Yi (\u5143\u7fcc), the daughter of a member of the imperial clan, to marry her to Yujiul\u00fc Tahan (\u90c1\u4e45\u95fe\u5854\u5bd2), the brother of Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiul\u00fc Anagui. But Yuwen, believing that to be insufficient, requested Emperor Wen divorce his wife Empress Yifu and marry Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen was forced to agree, and he deposed Empress Yifu, ordering her to become a Buddhist nun, and married Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter as empress. (In 540, under Rouran pressure, Empress Yifu would be forced to commit suicide.)\n\nBy summer 538, however, Eastern Wei generals Hou Jing and Gao Aocao had surrounded Luoyang. Yuwen and Emperor Wen proceeded to Luoyang to try to lift the siege. When Yuwen arrived, Hou and Gao initially lifted the siege on Luoyang, but when Yuwen chased after them, his horse was shot by an arrow, and he fell off his horse and was nearly captured, but both he and his general Li Mu (\u674e\u7a46) pretended to be common soldiers and were able to escape. Once Yuwen returned to Western Wei camp, Western Wei forces again attacked and killed Gao. Later that day, however, an Eastern Wei counterattack inflicted major losses on Western Wei forces, forcing Yuwen to withdraw and rendezvous with Emperor Wen at Hengnong. Meanwhile, however, Eastern Wei captives in Chang'an heard of the Western Wei defeat and rebelled within the city, led by the general Zhao Qingque (\u8d75\u9752\u96c0), forcing the official Zhou Huida (\u5468\u60e0\u8fbe), who had been left in charge of Chang'an, to flee the city with the crown prince Yuan Qin. Under the advice of Lu Tong (\u9646\u901a), Yuwen quickly returned west and defeated Zhao, suppressing his rebellion. Around this time, Yuwen also started setting up his headquarters at Hua Province (\u534e\u5dde, roughly modern Weinan), not far from Chang'an but maintaining some distance from the capital, incorporate many talented officials and generals into his staff. He further established a night school for the junior officers and officials in his administration at Hua Province.\n\nIn 541, under Su's suggestion, Yuwen had Emperor Wen issue an edict outlining six principles of government, intending to reduce corruption and wastefulness and strengthen the economy:\n\n\u2022 Qingxinsi (\u6e05\u5fc3\u601d) -- ordering the officials to clean their hearts and not desire many things.\n\n\u2022 Dunjiaohua (\u6566\u6559\u5316) -- instituting a regime of moral education.\n\n\u2022 Jindili (\u5c3d\u5730\u5229) -- the concept of encouraging agriculture and maximizing the utility of the land.\n\n\u2022 Zhuoxianliang (\u64e2\u8d24\u826f) -- finding capable individuals to promote, regardless of their family backgrounds.\n\n\u2022 Xuyusong (\u6064\u72f1\u8bbc) -- forbidding torture and instituting the concept that it would be preferable to let the guilty go than to punish an innocent.\n\n\u2022 Junfuyi (\u5747\u8d4b\u5f79) -- the concept that tax and labor burdens must be fair, and that powerful families may not avoid them.\n\nYuwen ordered that all of the officials of the state must study the six principles and further be able to balance budgets, at the pain of being relieved from their offices.\n\nIn spring 543, the Eastern Wei official Gao Zhongmi (\u9ad8\u4ef2\u5bc6), the governor of North Yu Province (\u5317\u8c6b\u5dde, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan), angry that Gao Huan's son Gao Cheng had tried to rape his second wife, and in a dispute with Gao Cheng's assistant Cui Xian (\u5d14\u66b9) over his having divorced Cui's sister, rebelled and surrendered his headquarters of Hulao (\u864e\u7262, in modern Zhengzhou) to Western Wei. Yuwen personally led troops to try to save Gao Zhongmi. At Luoyang, however, he was defeated by the Eastern Wei general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u4e50) and was nearly captured, only managing to elude capture by throwing gold at Peng to bribe him and persuade him that if he captured Yuwen, he would be no longer any use to Gao Huan. The next day, a Western Wei counterattack in turn almost killed Gao Huan, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Yuwen was forced to withdraw, but against advice from Feng Zihui (\u5c01\u5b50\u7ed8) and Chen Yuankang (\u9648\u5143\u5eb7), Gao Huan failed to chase Yuwen and allowed him to escape. The defeat was considered so major that Yuwen offered to have his rank reduced, but Emperor Wen did not accept the request.\n\nIn 545, Yuwen, seeing that one of Rouran's vassals, Tujue, was growing in strength, sent a messenger, Annuo Pantuo (\u5b89\u8bfa\u76d8\u9640) to Tujue to greet its chief Ashina Tumen, to try to establish friendly relations.\n\nIn 546, Gao Huan launched another major attack on Western Wei, putting Yubi (\u7389\u58c1, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) under siege, intending to draw Western Wei forces to try to save Yubi, but Yuwen took no reaction to it, instead leaving Yubi's defense to the general Wei Xiaokuan. Wei ably defended Yubi, draining the strength of the Eastern Wei forces, and as Gao grew ill, Eastern Wei forces were forced to withdraw with major losses.\n\nLater in 546, Su died. Yuwen mourned him greatly, and personally attended Su's burial, crying bitterly.\n\nIn spring 547, the Eastern Wei general Hou Jing, who was in charge of Eastern Wei provinces south of the Yellow River, believing that Gao Huan had died (indeed, Gao had, although his son Gao Cheng was keeping the death a secret) and not willing to submit to Gao Cheng, surrendered the provinces initially to Western Wei and then to Liang. Yuwen conferred honorary titles on Hou, but was initially unwilling to send relief troops. With Wang Sizheng advocating taking four provinces that Hou offered in exchange for aid, however, Yuwen sent Li Bi (\u674e\u5f3c) and Zhao Gui to assist Wang, initially forcing Eastern Wei forces attacking Hou to withdraw. Soon, however, Western Wei generals and Hou began to suspect each other, and after Yuwen ordered Hou to proceed to Chang'an to greet Emperor Wen and Hou refused, the sides officially broke, and the Western Wei generals held onto the four provinces without rendering further aid to Hou, who from that point on depending solely on Liang aid. (Later that year, however, the Eastern Wei general Murong Shaozong (\u6155\u5bb9\u7ecd\u5b97) would crush Liang forces commanded by Xiao Yuanming, the nephew of Emperor Wu of Liang, capturing Xiao Yuanming, and then in early 548 defeat Hou and force him to flee to Liang, taking all of the provinces back except the four that Western Wei had taken.)\n\nIn summer 548, Yuwen and Yuan Qin the Crown Prince carried out a tour of Western Wei's border provinces, but upon hearing that Emperor Wen was ill, cut their tour short and returned to Chang'an. However, when they did, Emperor Wen had already been healed, and Yuwen thereafter returned to his headquarters at Hua Province.\n\nAround the same time, the Eastern Wei general Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3, Gao Huan's cousin) launched an attack on Yingchuan (\u988d\u5ddd, in modern Xuchang, Henan), one of the major cities that Western Wei took from Hou. Wang, defending Yingchuan, initially repelled Eastern Wei's attacks, but with Eastern Wei diverting Wei River (\u6d27\u6c34) to flood Yingchuan, it was in the danger of falling. Yuwen sent Zhao to try to lift the siege, but Zhao was impeded by the water and was unable to proceed to Yingchuan. A counterattack by Wang, however, killed Murong Shaozong and Liu Fengsheng (\u5218\u4e30\u751f), temporarily relieving the pressure on Yingchuan. Gao Cheng himself reinforced Gao Yue's army, and by summer 549 captured Yingchuan, taking Wang captive. With Yingchuan having fallen, Yuwen ordered a general withdrawal from the area, and the provinces taken from Hou were retaken by Eastern Wei.\n\nMeanwhile, with Hou having rebelled against Liang's Emperor Wu in 548 and captured the Liang capital Jiankang in 549, Liang was in disarray, with Hou and the various imperial princes and governors fighting for control. By winter 549, one of the Liang princes, Xiao Cha the Prince of Yueyang (Emperor Wu's grandson), fearing an attack from his uncle Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong (Emperor Wu's son), surrendered his domain around the city Xiangyang (\u8944\u9633, in modern Xiangfan, Hubei) to Western Wei, requesting protection. Yuwen sent the general Yang Zhong (\u6768\u5fe0) to aid Xiao Cha, and after Yang defeated and captured Xiao Yi's general Liu Zhongli (\u67f3\u4ef2\u793c) in spring 550, Western Wei made peace with Xiao Yi, setting the borders in such a way to put Xiao Cha under Western Wei's protection. Yuwen created Xiao Cha the title \"Prince of Liang,\" preparing to have him claim the Liang throne as Western Wei's vassal.\n\nIn summer 550, Gao Cheng's brother Gao Yang, who had controlled the Eastern Wei government after Gao Cheng's death in 549, forced Eastern Wei's Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending Eastern Wei and starting Northern Qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). In response, Yuwen launched a major attack on the newly established Northern Qi, reaching Jian Province (\u5efa\u5dde, roughly modern Jincheng, Shanxi). However, Gao Yang himself led a strong army to defend against Yuwen's attack, and Yuwen, upon hearing that Gao Yang's army was well-run, made the comment, \"Alas, Gao Huan is not dead.\" Meanwhile, due to rains, the livestock that Western Wei forces relied on were dying in large numbers, and so Yuwen was forced to retreat. While there appeared to be few casualties, Northern Qi was in turn able to make minor border gains in light of Yuwen's withdrawal.\n\nAround the new year 550, another son of Liang's Emperor Wu, Xiao Guan (\u8427\u7eb6) the Prince of Shaoling, attempted to recapture Anlu (\u5b89\u9646, in modern Xiaogan, Hubei), which Yang had earlier captured from Xiao Yi. Yuwen sent Yang to relieve Anlu, and Yang not only did so, but proceeded to siege Xiao Guan's headquarters at Ru'nan (\u6c5d\u5357, in modern Jingmen, Hubei), capturing it and then executing Xiao Guan.\n\nIn spring 551, Emperor Wen died, and Yuan Qin succeeded him (as Emperor Fei).\n\nDuring Emperors Feis reign\n\nYuwen Tai appeared to hold an even firmer grip on power after Emperor Wen's death. Emperor Fei's wife Empress Yuwen was Yuwen Tai's daughter, and while it was recorded that he did not have any concubines because he loved her greatly, it could have also been that he feared Yuwen's power and therefore did not have any concubines.\n\nIn summer 551, the Tiele were launching an attack on Rouran, when Tujue's chieftain Ashina Tumen intercepted the Tiele and captured a large number of the Tiele people. Ashina Tumen, after his victory, sought a marriage with a daughter of Yujiul\u00fc Anagui. Yujiul\u00fc Anagui felt insulted and refused, viewing the Tujue as inferior; in response, Ashina Tumen cut off relations with Rouran. Yuwen took this opportunity to create an alliance with Tujue, sending the Princess Changle to Tujue to marry Ashina Tumen.\n\nIn summer 552, with Xiao Yi and Hou Jing battling each other, Xiao Yi sought help from Western Wei and agreed to cede Nanzheng (\u5357\u90d1, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) to Western Wei, but the order was declined by Xiao Yi's cousin, Xiao Xun (\u8427\u5faa). Yuwen and his general Daxi Wu (\u8fbe\u595a\u6b66) thus attacked Hanzhong. Xiao Xun instead turned to another brother of Xiao Yi, Xiao Ji the Prince of Wuling for aid, and Xiao Ji sent reinforcements commanded by the general Yang Qianyun (\u6768\u4e7e\u8fd0). Yuwen and Daxi put Nanzheng under siege, and due to the length of the siege, Yuwen and Daxi became angry and ordered that the city be slaughtered when it falls, but at the intercession of Xiao Xun's chief of staff Liu Fan (\u5218\u74a0), whom Western Wei forces captured during the siege and whose talent Yuwen respected, Yuwen rescinded the order. Soon thereafter, Xiao Xun surrendered, and Nanzheng was in Western Wei hands. Yuwen initially agreed to allow Xiao Xun to return to Liang, but instead detained him, releasing him only after Liu again persuaded him to do so, reminding him of his promise. (During the conversation Liu had with Yuwen, Liu commented that he initially thought of Yuwen as Tang of Shang and King Wu of Zhou, but because of his failure to follow his promise, found him to be less than Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin. Yuwen instead compared himself to Yi Yin (\u4f0a\u5c39, a legendary regent of Shang Dynasty) and Duke of Zhou, apparently disavowing intentions on the throne for the time being.)\n\nIn spring 553, with Xiao Ji and Xiao Yi, both of whom having claimed Liang's imperial title after Hou's fall, battling each other, Xiao Yi sought aid from Western Wei, requesting Western Wei to attack Xiao Ji's home base of Chengdu (\u6210\u90fd, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) from the rear. Yuwen sent his nephew Yuchi Jiong to attack Xiao Ji's domain (modern Sichuan and Chongqing). Most of Xiao Ji's domain fell into Western Wei hands, and subsequently, Xiao Ji was defeated and captured by Xiao Yi.\n\nIn winter 553, the imperial official Yuan Lie (\u5143\u70c8) formed a conspiracy to kill Yuwen, but the news leaked. Yuwen killed him. Following Yuan Lie's death, Emperor Fei himself was angry and wanted to kill Yuwen, despite advise from his cousins Yuan Yu (\u5143\u80b2) the Prince of Huaiai and Yuan Zan (\u5143\u8d5e) the Prince of Guangping. However, Emperor Fei's apparent attempt to court the imperial guards became known by the commanders, several of whom were Yuwen's sons-in-law, and Yuwen put Emperor Fei under house arrest and then deposed him, replacing him with his younger brother Yuan Kuo the Prince of Qi (as Emperor Gong). Yuwen took this opportunity to change the Han names for the Xianbei that Emperor Xiaowen had instituted back to the original Xianbei names, including changing the imperial surname Yuan back to Tuoba. Further, because Xianbei legends indicated that originally, the Tuoba tribe had 36 subtribes and 99 subclans, Yuwen chose 36 key Han generals and 99 commanders and changed their names to Xianbei names, to fill out the original names. Yuwen subsequently put the former emperor to death. It was recorded that Empress Yuwen, Yuwen Tai's daughter, also \"suffered death because of her loyalty to Wei,\" but it is not known exactly whether Yuwen killed her.\n\nDuring Emperor Gongs reign\n\nIn spring 554, while on a diplomatic mission to Liang (now with Xiao Yi as its undisputed emperor\u2014as Emperor Yuan), the Western Wei official Yuwen Renshu (\u5b87\u6587\u4ec1\u6055, probably Yuwen Tai's relative but relationship is unclear) was slighted by Emperor Yuan, who treated Northern Qi's ambassador with far greater respect. Emperor Yuan then further aggravated the situation by sending an impolite letter to Yuwen Tai demanding that the borders be redrawn in accordance with old borders. Yuwen made the comment, \"Xiao Yi is the type of person that, as said in proverbs, 'One who has been abandoned by heaven cannot be revived by anyone else.'\" Yuwen Tai therefore began to prepare attacking Emperor Yuan at his headquarters of Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), as Emperor Yuan had made Jiangling his capital and declined to move back to the old capital Jiankang. The Western Wei general Ma Bofu (\u9a6c\u4f2f\u7b26), formerly a Liang general, secretly revealed the attack plans to Emperor Yuan, but Emperor Yuan did not believe Ma and took minimal precautions.\n\nIn winter 554, under Yuwen Tai's orders, Western Wei forces, commanded by Yu Jin (\u4e8e\u8c28), who was assisted by Yuwen Tai's nephew Yuwen Hu and Yang Zhong, launched a major attack on Liang. Emperor Yuan initially did not take reports of the Western Wei attack seriously, and while he summoned his major generals Wang Sengbian and Wang Lin from afar, he himself took little defensive or evasive actions. Yu quickly descended on Jiangling and put it under siege. Soon, Emperor Yuan surrendered, and Western Wei forces gave him to Xiao Cha to be executed. Western Wei created Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang (as Emperor Xuan) and gave him the Jiangling area (known in history as Western Liang) in exchange for his old domain of Xiangyang area, which Western Wei took control directly. (However, the rest of Liang did not recognize Emperor Xuan, and soon recognized a rival candidate for the throne supported by Northern Qi, Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming.) Most residents of Jiangling were seized as slaves, although eventually most of them were released by Yuwen after he was persuaded to do so by one of the captives, the Liang official Yu Jicai (\u5ebe\u5b63\u624d).\n\nAround the near year 556, after Tujue's Mugan Khan Ashina Qijin thoroughly crushed Rouran's last khan Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi, Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi fled to Western Wei. Ashina Qijin demanded the execution of Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi, and Yuwen Tai, fearing a Tujue attack, turned Yujiul\u00fc Dengshuzi and 3000 of his followers to the Tujue ambassadors, who slaughtered them.\n\nAlso around the new year 556, Yuwen Tai promulgated a new government structure, dividing the government into six ministries, based on the Zhou Dynasty model. (This structure was initially devised by Su Chuo, and after Su Chuo's death, Yuwen had it further revised by Lu Bian (\u5362\u8fa9).) He also had Tuoba Yu the Prince of Huai'an submit a request, and then have Emperor Gong formally approve the request, to have all imperial princes reduced in rank to dukes, in accordance with the Zhou tradition.\n\nIn spring 556, Yuwen was pondering the issue of succession. His wife Princess Pingyi had one son, Yuwen Jue, but his oldest son, Yuwen Yu, was born of his concubine Lady Yao, and was married to the daughter of one of his chief generals, Dugu Xin. On the advice of Li Yuan (\u674e\u8fdc), who argued that the son of a wife always had precedence over the son of a concubine, Yuwen Tai made Yuwen Jue his heir apparent.\n\nin fall 556, while Yuwen Tai was on a tour of the norther provinces, he became ill at Qiantun Mountain (\u7275\u5c6f\u5c71, in modern Guyuan, Ningxia). He summoned his nephew Yuwen Hu to Qiantun and entrusted the affairs of the state as well as his sons to Yuwen Hu. He soon died, and Yuwen Jue took over his titles, while Yuwen Hu took the reins of the state, and under Yuwen Hu's tutelage, Yuwen Jue soon took the throne from Emperor Gong, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou.\n\nFamily\n\nConsorts and Issue:\n\n\u2022 Empress Wen, of the Yuan clan of Henan (\u6587\u7687\u540e \u6cb3\u5357\u5143\u6c0f; d. 551)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Jue, Emperor Xiaomin (\u5b5d\u95f5\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u89c9; 542\u2013557), third son\n\n\u2022 Empress Xuan, of the Chinu clan (\u5ba3\u7687\u540e \u53f1\u5974\u6c0f; d. 574)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Yong, Emperor Wu (\u6b66\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u9095; 543\u2013578), fourth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhi, Prince Weila (\u536b\u524c\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u76f4; d. 574), sixth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Yao clan (\u592b\u4eba \u59da\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Yu, Emperor Ming (\u660e\u7687\u5e1d \u5b87\u6587\u6bd3; 534\u2013560), first son\n\n\u2022 Fei, of the Dabugan clan (\u5983 \u8fbe\u6b65\u5e72\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Xian, Prince Qiyang (\u9f50\u7080\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u5baa; 545\u2013578), fifth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Quan clan (\u592b\u4eba \u6743\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Jian, Prince Qiaoxiao (\u8c2f\u5b5d\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u4fed; 551\u2013578), eighth son\n\n\u2022 Furen, of the Wuliuhun clan (\u592b\u4eba \u4e4c\u516d\u6d51\u6c0f), personal name Xianyu (\u663e\u7389)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Tong, Prince Jikang (\u5180\u5eb7\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u901a; 555\u2013571), 12th son\n\n\u2022 Lady, of the Wang clan (\u738b\u6c0f)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhao, Prince Zhaojian (\u8d75\u50ed\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u62db; d. 581), seventh son\n\n\u2022 Lady, of the Zhang clan (\u5f20\u6c0f), personal name N\u00fcbi (\u5973\u6bd5)\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Da, Prince Daibi (\u4ee3\u5970\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u8fbe; d. 581), 11th son\n\n\u2022 Unknown\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Zhen, Duke Songxian (\u5b8b\u732e\u516c \u5b87\u6587\u9707; d. 550), second son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Chun, Prince Chenhuo (\u9648\u60d1\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u7eaf; d. 581), ninth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen Sheng, Prince Yueye (\u8d8a\u91ce\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u76db; d. 581), tenth son\n\n\u2022 Yuwen You, Prince Tengwen (\u6ed5\u95fb\u738b \u5b87\u6587\u900c; 556\u2013581), 13th son\n\n\u2022 First daughter (d. 554)\n\n\u2022 Married Yuan Qin of Henan (\u6cb3\u5357; 525\u2013554)\n\n\u2022 Princess Xiangyang (\u8944\u9633\u516c\u4e3b), fifth daughter\n\n\u2022 Married Dou Yi of Henan, Duke Shenwu (\u6cb3\u5357 \u7aa6\u6bc5; 519\u2013583), and had issue (two sons, two daughters), their daughter Lady Dou would later become the wife of Li Yuan, the founding Emperor of the Tang Dynasty\n\n\u2022 Princess Yi'an (\u4e49\u5b89\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Li Hui of Liaodong, Duke Wei (\u8fbd\u4e1c \u674e\u6656)\n\n\u2022 Princess Shunyang (\u987a\u9633\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Yang Zan (\u6768\u74d2; 550\u2013591)\n\n\u2022 Princess Pingyuan (\u5e73\u539f\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Yu Yi of Henan, Duke Ren (\u6cb3\u5357 \u4e8e\u7ffc; d. 583), and had issue (three sons)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yongfu (\u6c38\u5bcc\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Shi Xiong (\u53f2\u96c4)\n\n\u2022 Princess Xihe (\u897f\u6cb3\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Liu Chang, Duke Peng (\u5218\u6636; d. 597)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yigui (\u4e49\u5f52\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Li Ji, Duke Qinghe (\u674e\u57fa; 531\u2013561), and had issue (one son)\n\n\u2022 Princess Yidu (\u5b9c\u90fd\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Liang Rui, Duke Jiang (\u6881\u777f; 531\u2013595)\n\n\u2022 Princess Deguang (\u5fb7\u5e7f\u516c\u4e3b)\n\n\u2022 Married Zhao Yongguo of Tianshui (\u5929\u6c34 \u8d75\u6c38\u56fd; d. 557)\n\n\u2022 A daughter who married Heba Wei, Duke Huo (\u8d3a\u62d4\u7eac)\n\n\u2022 A daughter who married Ruogan Feng, Duke Xu (\u82e5\u5e72\u51e4)\n\nAncestry"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Xiang-Yu", "page_content": "Xiang Yu, Wade-Giles romanization Hsiang Y\u00fc, original name Xiang Ji, courtesy name Yu, (born 232, state of Chu, China\u2014died 202 bce, Anhui province), Chinese general and leader of the rebel forces that overthrew the Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 bce). He was the principal contestant for control of China with Liu Bang, who, as the Gaozu emperor, founded the Han dynasty (206 bce\u2013220 ce). Xiang Yu\u2019s defeat signaled the end of the old aristocratic order in China.\n\nXiang Yu was a member of a prominent family in Chu, one of the Chinese states absorbed by the Qin dynasty when it united China and abolished the small feudal kingdoms into which the country had been divided. When rebellions erupted against the dynasty, Xiang Yu joined the Chu armies led by his uncle, eventually succeeding him as supreme commander. Xiang Yu\u2019s forces captured the Qin capital and executed the last Qin emperor.\n\nXiang Yu then attempted to restore the earlier ruling system. He gave the title of emperor to a member of the former imperial family of the state of Chu and divided the country between the various insurgent generals, making each a ruler of one of the old royal houses. Xiang Yu took the old territory of Chu and reserved for himself the title of hegemon king.\n\nSoon, however, he had the emperor executed, thus precipitating a struggle for supremacy with his rival generals, the foremost of whom was Liu Bang, who had been given control of western China. Of peasant origin, Liu was a blunt, crude man but one who knew how to win the hearts of the people. He had gradually eliminated his rivals in the west and consolidated his position. Xiang Yu, by contrast, epitomized the aristocrat. He was tall and muscular, a poet and an educated man, and a superb military tactician; yet he lacked the personal magnetism to gain and hold the loyalty of the common people. The truce that the two rivals for power concluded was violated almost immediately by Liu Bang, who also repeatedly declined Xiang Yu\u2019s offers to settle their conflict in hand-to-hand combat. In 202 Xiang Yu\u2019s forces were overwhelmed, and he chose suicide rather than capture.

During his reign, the Hongwu emperor instituted military, administrative, and educational reforms that centred power in the emperor.\n\nEarly life The future Hongwu emperor was born in 1328 as Zhu Chongba, a poor peasant of Haozhou (about 100 miles [160 km] northwest of Nanjing, near China\u2019s east coast). Orphaned at 16, he became a monk at the Huangjue monastery near Fengyang to avoid starvation\u2014a common practice for the sons of poor peasants. As a wandering mendicant, he often begged for food at Hefei (some 100 miles west of Nanjing) and surrounding areas, where no constituted authority existed. Indeed, all of central and northern China was suffering from drought and famine, and more than seven million people starved, a situation that encouraged the popular rebellions that started from around 1325. Led by plebeian bandits, the rebels attacked the rich, distributing their wealth and goods among the people.\n\nEmergence as general One such rebel was Guo Zixing, who in 1352 led a large force to attack and take Haozhou. Zhu joined the rebel forces and changed his name to Zhu Yuanzhang, rising from the ranks to become second-in-command. Guo Zixing, a mere bandit leader, became jealous of Zhu Yuanzhang, who distinguished himself as a military leader. These problems were later mitigated when Zhu Yuanzhang married Guo\u2019s adopted daughter, the princess Ma, who was influential in reconciling the two men. In 1353 Zhu Yuanzhang captured Chuzhou (now in Anhui province, northwest of Nanjing). Subsequently he received important commissions, gaining a following of outstanding men, some of whom later became officials under the early Ming dynasty. In 1355 Guo Zixing died, and Zhu Yuanzhang took over the leadership of the rebel army. Zhu Yuangzhang attacked and captured towns and cities in eastern China and, on reaching the Yangtze River (Chang Jiang) delta, encountered educated men of the gentry class. Some decided to join his movement, and Zhu had the foresight to seek their guidance. From them he learned the rudiments of the Chinese language and studied Chinese history and the Confucian Classics. More significantly, he learned the principles of government and built up an effective administration in local areas alongside the military structure. Moreover, he was persuaded by his scholars to present himself as a national leader against the Mongols rather than as a popular rebel. His choice of advisers and his shrewd ability to adopt sound governmental measures ultimately made him the most formidable leader against the Mongols. Now determined to overthrow the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty (1206\u20131368), Zhu marched toward Nanjing and captured it in 1356. Nanjing was a strategic point, close to the rich lands of the Yangtze delta. Proclaiming himself duke of Wu, Zhu established an effective administration over the Nanjing area with the help of the scholars and on their advice refrained from roaming aimlessly from place to place to plunder. He also encouraged agriculture by granting unused land to the landless peasants, but, in spite of his successes, he was still reluctant to proclaim himself king (wang). At that time he acknowledged the Song dynasty pretender, Han Lin\u2019er, as his superior, even though Han was ineffectual. Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now Meanwhile, the northern provinces were as restless as the south, and, when various rebels defied the Mongols, the capable Mongol minister Tuotuo personally led troops to subdue them. The north, thus, had a semblance of peace, whereas the south could not be controlled by the Mongol authorities.\n\nNational military leadership Zhu now emerged as the national leader against the Mongols, though he had other rivals for power. Chief among them were Chen Youliang and Zhang Shicheng. Chen Youliang was the self-proclaimed emperor of the Han dynasty and was based in Wuchang (in Hubei province, about 400 miles [650 km] west of Shanghai), controlling a large portion of central China. Zhang Shicheng, the self-proclaimed prince Cheng of the Zhou dynasty, operated at Pingjiang (now Suzhou, in Jiangsu province adjoining the east coast and including Nanjing) in the east. In 1363 a decisive naval battle at Lake Poyang (south of the Yangtze in the north of Jiangxi province) was fought between Chen Youliang\u2019s huge fleet of war junks and Zhu\u2019s small but swift barges. The three-day battle ended with Chen\u2019s death and the destruction of his fleet. Wuchang, Chen\u2019s stronghold, was captured in 1364, followed by the capture of Hubei, Hunan (a large province west of Jiangxi), and Jiangxi provinces. In the same year Zhu proclaimed himself prince of Wu. With the death of Chen Youliang, events moved quickly to a climax. In 1367 the Song pretender Han Lin\u2019er felt so threatened by the Mongols at his headquarters at Chuzhou that he decided to flee to Nanjing for protection.

08:57\n\n\n\nFive-year research sheds light on a mystery that has simmered for a century since Emperor Guangxu's death on November 14, 1904. [File photos]\n\nExactly 100 years after his death, it has finally been confirmed that Emperor Guangxu (1871-1908) was a victim of arsenic poisoning, though the murderer remains a mystery.\n\nThe finding has been revealed by a research team in Beijing, based on a five-year study of the emperor's remains and the conditions inside and outside his tomb. The investigators included the Western Qing Imperial Tombs (Qing Xi Ling) administrators, China Institute of Atomic Energy and forensic science experts from Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau.\n\n\n\nEmperor Guangxu\n\nEmperor Guangxu was the penultimate emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) but throughout his rule he was completely manipulated by the Empress Dowager Cixi. He died at the age of 37 on Nov 14, 1908, and 74-year-old Cixi passed away the next day, fueling decades of debate over Guangxu's death.\n\nResearchers analyzed hair and clothes samples from Guangxu's body and found he had more than triple a fatal dose. They attributed its existence in the clothes around his stomach to corrosion caused by the decay of his poisoned body.\n\nExperts have also dismissed the possibility of Guangxu being poisoned by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Historical documents show he was prescribed TCM during his reign and some elements might have led to an overdose of arsenic and mercury.\n\nHowever, experts said that in the case of chronic toxicity, the ends of hair follicles contain higher amounts of poison than the rest of the hair. The opposite was true for Guangxu's hair.\n\nThey have also found proof of their arsenic conclusion in the memoirs of imperial doctors involved in Guangxu's treatment before he died and in the diaries of State Council (Junji Chu) officials.\n\nGuangxu was 4 when he was chosen to be emperor by Empress Cixi, his aunt, after her only son, Emperor Tongzhi died.\n\nAlthough he took power at the age of 16, it was Cixi who exerted total control over the court and the country. Tension mounted between the two as Guangxu tried to act independently and introduce political, legal and social reforms, threatening Cixi's power.\n\nGuangxu started the famous \"Hundred Days' Reform\" in 1898 but failed. Cixi restored her own regency and confined the emperor to a small palace, Yingtai Terrace, for 10 years.\n\nWhether Guangxu was murdered has been one of China's historical mysteries. The top three suspects are Cixi, Yuan Shikai and Li Lianying.\n\nSome believe Cixi didn't want Guangxu to grab power back after she died and killed him first.\n\nOr maybe it was Yuan Shikai, a key military official and politician of the imperial court, who betrayed Guangxu in the \"Hundred Days' Reform\". He feared his life would be in danger after Cixi's death and might have bribed a eunuch to poison the emperor.\n\nLi Lianying was one of Cixi's favorite and most loyal eunuchs. He is also under suspicion because he was told that Guangxu had written in his diary to execute him and Yuan Shikai after Cixi died."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Kwangju-Uprising", "page_content": "Kwangju Uprising, also called Kwangju Rebellion, Kwangju also spelled Gwangju, mass protest against the South Korean military government that took place in the southern city of Kwangju between May 18 and 27, 1980. Nearly a quarter of a million people participated in the rebellion. Although it was brutally repressed and initially unsuccessful in bringing about democratic reform in South Korea, it is considered to have been a pivotal moment in the South Korean struggle for democracy.\n\nThe roots of the Kwangju Uprising may be traced to the authoritarianism of the Republic of Korea\u2019s first president, the anticommunist Syngman Rhee. During his almost 18 years in office, Rhee grew continuously more repressive toward his political opposition in particular and the country\u2019s citizens in general. Those conditions precipitated massive student-led demonstrations in early 1960 and Rhee\u2019s ouster in April of that year. After the country was governed for a brief period by a parliamentary system, a military coup led by Gen. Park Chung-Hee displaced the government in May 1961. Park became president the following year and remained in office for the next 18 years.\n\nAs president, Park repressed the political opposition and the personal freedom of South Korea\u2019s citizens and controlled the press and the universities. In December 1972 he introduced the Yushin Constitution, which dramatically increased presidential powers and created a virtual dictatorship. When Park was assassinated on October 26, 1979, a power void resulted that was filled by Chun Doo-Hwan, a brigadier general who had taken control of the South Korean military through an internal coup. Once in power, Chun persuaded the new president, Choi Kyu-Hah, to name him chief of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency in April 1980. The military, under Chun\u2019s leadership, declared martial law the following month.\n\nThe situation soon escalated with a series of nationwide protests against military rule that were led by labour activists, students, and opposition leaders, who began calling for democratic elections. Kwangju\u2014the provincial capital of South Ch\u014flla (South Jeolla), in southwestern South Korea\u2014which had a long history of political opposition and a simmering grievance toward the Park regime, was a centre of the pro-democracy movement. On May 18 some 600 students gathered at Chonnam National University to protest against the suppression of academic freedom and were beaten by government forces. Civilian demonstrators joined the students.\n\nWith the approval of the United States, which had maintained operational control over combined U.S. and Korean forces since the end of the Korean War, Chun\u2019s government sent elite paratroopers from the Special Forces to Kwangju to contain the unrest. When the soldiers arrived, they began beating the demonstrators. Rather than squelch the protest, the brutal tactics had the opposite affect, inciting more citizens to join in.\n\nAs the uprising continued, protesters broke into police stations and armories to seize weapons. They armed themselves with bats, knives, pipes, hammers, Molotov cocktails, and whatever else they could find. They faced 18,000 riot police and 3,000 paratroopers. On May 20 a newspaper called the Militants\u2019 Bulletin was published to counter the \u201cofficial\u201d news being published by government-run or highly partisan media outlets such as the newspaper Chosun Ilbo, which had characterized the protesters as hoodlums with guns. By the early evening of May 21, the government had retreated, and the citizens of Kwangju declared the city liberated from military rule.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In the predawn hours of May 27, Chun\u2019s military forces unleashed tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and helicopters that began indiscriminately attacking the city. It took the military only two hours to completely crush the uprising. According to official government figures, nearly 200 people\u2014the great majority of them civilians\u2014were killed in the rebellion, but Kwangju citizens and students insisted that the number was closer to 2,000.\n\nDespite the uprising\u2019s failure to bring about democracy in the Korean peninsula, the sentiments surrounding the episode continued to simmer afterward. By the late 1980s public demand and scrutiny had led to the reinstitution of direct presidential elections under Chun\u2019s chosen successor, Roh Tae-Woo, and in 1993 Kim Young-Sam became the first president democratically elected by the Korean people. In 1998 Kim Dae-Jung, who had once been arrested and sentenced to death for his role during the Kwangju Uprising, became the second democratically elected president; Roh Moo Hyun, who became president in 2003, also had a connection to the uprising. In 1996 Chun and Roh Tae-Woo had been convicted of mutiny, treason, and corruption in connection with the 1979 coup and the Kwangju massacre, but Kim Dae-Jung upon taking office as president in 1997 pardoned both men.\n\nThe events of 1980 in Kwangju continued to have a significant impact on the Korean people and the politics on the peninsula. The role played by the U.S. military during the uprising led to an increase in anti-American sentiment among South Korean students and activists. A national cemetery in Kwangju is dedicated to the victims killed during the struggle for democracy. A Kwangju museum devoted to the uprising and the designation of May 18 as a national day of commemoration likewise mark the significance of the Kwangju Uprising in the development of democracy in South Korea."}]}
