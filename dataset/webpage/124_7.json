He served in the Second Boer War and during World War I he served briefly on the Western Front but went on to spend most of the war playing an important role commanding forces on the Macedonian front. As Chief of the Imperial General Staff he generally promoted the mechanization of British land forces although limited practical progress was made during his term in office.\n\nArmy career\n\nBorn the son of George Milne and Williamina Milne (n\u00e9e Panton) and educated at MacMillan's School in Aberdeen and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Milne was commissioned into the Royal Artillery on 16 September 1885. He was initially posted to a battery at Trimulgherry in India and then joined a battery at Aldershot in 1889 before being posted back to India to a battery at Meerut in 1891. Promoted to captain on 4 July 1895, he joined the garrison artillery in Malta and then took part in the Suakin Expedition in 1896. Next he was appointed battery captain at Hilsea and then attended Staff College, Camberley in 1897. He took part in the Nile Expedition in 1898 and served in the Second Boer War earning promotion to major on 1 November 1899, and having been appointed Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General on 18 February 1900, saw further promotion to lieutenant colonel on 1 November 1900. He was mentioned in despatches on 2 April 1901[8] and then awarded the Distinguished Service Order in June 1902.\n\nHe was appointed a Deputy-Assistant Quartermaster-General in the intelligence division at Headquarters on 26 January 1903 and then, having been promoted to colonel on 1 November 1905, became a general staff officer at Headquarters 46th North Midland Division in April 1908. He joined the general staff at Headquarters 6th Division in Cork in 1909 and, having been appointed CB in the King's Birthday Honours 1912, became Brigadier-General Royal Artillery for 4th Division at Woolwich on 1 October 1913.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in July 1914 Milne was commanding the divisional artillery of 4th Division which formed part of the British Expeditionary Force in France. He joined the general staff of III Corps in January 1915 and, having been promoted to major-general on 23 February 1915, was mentioned in despatches for his service during the Second Battle of Ypres.\n\nHe was appointed General Officer Commanding the 27th Division in July 1915, and was appointed to command XVI Corps in Salonika in January 1916 with orders to oppose Bulgarian advances on the Macedonian front. As Commander-in-Chief of the British Salonika Army he became Commander-in-Chief of British Troops in Macedonia on 9 May 1916. He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Eagle (1st Glass, with Swords) by the King of Serbia on 1 July 1916. Promoted to lieutenant general on 1 January 1917, he undertook numerous offensives in support of his French and Serbian Allies with limited resources who were constantly suffering from malaria and was appointed a Grand Officer of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus by the King of Italy on 31 August 1917 and advanced to KCB on 1 January 1918. Although Milne was replused at the Battle of Doiran in September 1918, French and Serbian units were successful in defeating the Bulgarian Army at the Battle of Dobro Pole which took place that same month. Bulgaria then signed an armistice.\n\nIn September 1918 Milne became responsible for the military administration of a vast area around the Black Sea at a time of considerable internal disorder following the Russian Revolution and the start of the Turkish War of Independence. He was appointed Grand Cross (First Class) of the Order of the Redeemer by the King of the Hellenes in October 1918, appointed KCMG on 1 January 1919, advanced to GCMG on 3 June 1919 and given the Greek Military Cross in July 1919. He was also awarded the Grand Cross of the French Legion of Honour in August 1919 and made a Knight of Grace of the Venerable Order of Saint John on 9 April 1920. In March 1920 he occupied Constantinople and took over the administration of the City which was collapsing.\n\nPromoted to full general on 26 April 1920, he was appointed Lieutenant of the Tower of London on 15 December 1920 and General Officer Commanding Eastern Command on 1 June 1923. Having been made ADC to the King on 31 July 1923, he became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on 19 February 1926. In that role supported the publication of the study Mechanised and Armoured Formations (issued in 1929) and generally promoted the mechanization of British land forces although limited practical progress was made during his term in office. Having been advanced to GCB in the New Year Honours 1927, he was promoted to field marshal on 30 January 1928 before retiring in 1933. On 28 January 1933 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Milne, of Salonika and of Rubislaw in the County of Aberdeen.\n\nHe was also Colonel Commandant of the Royal Artillery from 21 November 1918, Honorary Colonel of Hampshire Heavy Brigade from 24 April 1926, Master Gunner, St James's Park from 1929, Constable of The Tower of London from 1933 and Colonel Commandant of the Pioneer Corps from 1940.\n\nDuring World War II he was an Air Raid Warden in Westminster. He also wrote a weekly column for the Sunday Chronicle. He died in London on 23 March 1948.\n\nFamily\n\nIn 1905 he married Claire Maitland, daughter of Sir John Nisbet Maitland, 5th Baronet; they had a son and a daughter.["}, {"url": "https://spartacus-educational.com/FWWmilne.htm", "page_content": "George Milne\n\nGeorge Milne was born in 1866. During the early stages of the First World War he was a colonel with the British Expeditionary Force. After impressing senior officers on the Western Front, Milne was transferred to the Balkan Front where he became commander of the 27th Division.\n\nIn 1916 Milne was sent to Salonika under the French Commander-in-Chief, General Maurice Sarrail. He took part in the successful Vardar Offensive in the autumn of 1918 and afterwards led his troops into Turkey.

In 1913 he became commander of the artillery of the Fourth Division (Woolwich), and led this unit in France in August 1914 during the battles of Le Cateau, the Marne, and the Aisne. When Sir John French transferred the British Expeditionary Force to Flanders in October, Milne was promoted brigadier general; the next year promotion to major general on the General Staff of the Second Army followed. Milne's career shifted radically when he was given command of the Twenty-seventh Division and ordered to Salonika: he was chosen for this post primarily because it was believed that he was sufficiently strong of character to resist the blandishments of the French General Maurice Sarrail, the overall Allied field commander in Greece. In January 1916, Milne was entrusted with command of the XVI Corps, and later that year with all British forces at Salonika under General Sarrail, and then those under General Franchet d'Esperey. The story of the British at Salonika is one of frustration: Milne possessed insufficient troops, his units suffered from disease, and they labored under the difficulty of the terrain. The chief of the Imperial General Staff, Sir William Robertson, opted for a cautious stance in Greece against the Bulgars. It was not until April 24, 1917, that Milne was finally ordered to go on the attack near Lake Dorain, and he was repulsed with heavy losses. French and Serbian forces were finally able to advance against Bulgaria in 1918 and, after the collapse of the Sofia government, Milne advanced to the Turkish frontier, eventually occupying Constantinople after the fall of the Ottoman Empire. Milne remained at the Porte until November 1920, being promoted general that same year. Two years later he was given the Eastern Command at home, and in 1926 was appointed chief of the Imperial General Staff. He was promoted field marshal in 1928 and five years later retired as Baron Milne, of Salonika and Rubislaw, county of Aberdeen. Milne spent the Second World War enrolled in the Home Guard, and died in London on March 23, 1948. He was known for his keen wit, immense energy, and penetrating intellect."}, {"url": "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FZyBdWkAAAAJ", "page_content": "Picking Up the Pieces: Natchez Coalescence in the Shatter Zone GE Milne, R Ethridge, SM Shuck-Hall Mapping the Mississippian Shatter Zone: The Colonial Indian Slave Trade and \u2026 , 2009 12 2009\n\nNatchez Country: Indians GE Milne Colonists, and the Landscapes of Race in , 2015 6 2015\n\nThe Natchez Indians: A History to 1735 GE Milne Journal of Southern History 76 (1), 122-124 , 2010 2010\n\n15 Picking Up the Pieces GE MiLNE Mapping the Mississippian Shatter Zone: The Colonial Indian Slave Trade and \u2026 , 2009 2009"}, {"url": "https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/1260476", "page_content": "For Credit : Yes\n\nAttendance : Not Mandatory\n\nWould Take Again : Yes\n\nGrade : A"}]}
