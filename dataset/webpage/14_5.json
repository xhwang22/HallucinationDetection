Along with releasing five albums since 2005 (and an EP inspired by y\u00e9-y\u00e9, \u201860s French pop music), she\u2019s a frequent collaborator with contemporaries such as Bonnie \u201cPrince\u201d Billy, Norah Jones and composer Nico Muhly.\n\n\n\nShe has appeared with the Boston Pops and the NYC Ballet and in Lincoln Center\u2019s prestigious American Songbook Series, and spent the summer of 2014 working on a musical about fellow Louisville native Tori Murden McClure\u2019s quest to become the first woman to row across the Atlantic Ocean."}, {"url": "https://chapelboro.com/town-square/dawn-landes-music-ted-talks-and-more", "page_content": "Story via David Menconi, Down on Copperline, Orange County Arts Commission\n\nOne way or another, it was probably inevitable that Chapel Hill singer/songwriter Dawn Landes was going to wind up in show business. Born in Indiana, she spent most of her formative years growing up in Louisville, Kentucky. But there was also a stretch of time when her family lived in Branson, Missouri \u2013 which is basically Las Vegas for the state-fair level of the entertainment industry, with scores of live-music theaters.\n\n\u201cMy mom managed a theater for Yakov Smirnoff,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cYou know, the \u2018America, what a country\u2019 guy. He even lived in our basement for a while. I also babysat Tony Orlando\u2019s kids. Which was funny, you know, with my name being Dawn and all. Lots of jokes about that.\u201d\n\nOnce she started singing and writing songs, Landes carved out a solidly respectable niche in contemporary-folk circles. She\u2019s placed songs in a long list of television shows, \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d and \u201cGossip Girl\u201d among them, while releasing a wide-ranging catalog of a dozen albums and mini-albums. She\u2019s also toured extensively with ensembles including the Brooklyn group Hem and Sufjan Stevens\u2019 touring band before moving to Chapel Hill in 2020, drawn by her husband\u2019s family once they reached the stage of having children.\n\nIn recent years, Landes\u2019 music has taken a more conceptual turn, which includes her latest project \u2013 a revival of \u201cThe Liberated Woman\u2019s Songbook,\u201d based on the 1971 book of the same name by folksinger/author Jerry Silverman. The first iteration will be a live performance, April 14 at Raleigh\u2019s Fletcher Opera Theater, in which Landes will play reimagined versions of songs from the songbook with an all-star cast featuring bluegrass hall-of-famer Alice Gerrard, Rissi Palmer, Watchhouse\u2019s Emily Frantz, Charly Lowry, Kamara Thomas and Violet Bell\u2019s Lizzy Ross. Landes is also working on recording an album of songs drawn from the songbook for release at some future date.\n\n\u201cI wanted to study this period and the history of women\u2019s movements,\u201d Landes says. \u201cEducate myself on the history of change and what happens. I never took a woman\u2019s history class in school, so I\u2019ve tried to teach myself things I wish I\u2019d known. Like it blew my mind to learn that married women could not have a credit card in their own name until 1974. 1974! You look back 50 years and it\u2019s the same stuff as today \u2013 and now we\u2019re going backwards. You know, if we had to go back to the dentistry or TV programming of 50 years ago, people would be livid. But somehow it\u2019s okay to revert back on rights.\u201d\n\nPreceding \u201cThe Liberated Woman\u2019s Songbook\u201d was another multi-media project for Landes, \u201cRow,\u201d a 2020 musical about Victoria Murden McClure \u2013 the first woman to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean, which she did in a homemade boat. McClure has long been an inspirational figure for Landes, who did a 2015 TED Talk about her titled \u201cA Song For My Hero, The Woman Who Rowed Into A Hurricane.\u201d\n\nJust as it took McClure multiple attempts to complete her Trans-Atlantic journey after she encountered a hurricane during her first try, Landes did not have a straight-line trajectory in getting \u201cRow\u201d in front of audiences. It was supposed to debut in the fall of 2020, which the pandemic made impossible. But Landes finally recorded it with the Williamstown Theatre Company at its annual festival a year later for the platform Audible.\n\n\u201c\u2019Row\u2019 and the process of making a musical really changed my chemistry somehow,\u201d Landes says. \u201cI think about performing differently now, and we\u2019re trying to figure out next steps to develop it a little more. The life of a musical is very long. \u2018Row\u2019 is something I\u2019ve been working on for eight years and it\u2019s been a Ted Talk, an album, I\u2019ve done it live. But it\u2019s still not \u2018done\u2019 because it exists to be performed in theaters and it\u2019s still changing. So that\u2019s kind of crazy.\u201d\n\nMeantime, \u201cThe Liberated Woman\u2019s Songbook\u201d is keeping Landes busy. She\u2019s hoping that this first live performance of it won\u2019t be the end of the project.\n\n\u201cThis is more like an old-timey revue than a musical, and I\u2019m excited to have all these incredible performers join me,\u201d Landes says. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the album version, too. My dream would be to someday take this performance to different cities with local performers in each place, showcase the talented female singers and songwriters I know in different towns. There are so many great people out there.\u201d\n\n(photos via Orange County Arts Commission)\n\nChapelboro.com has partnered with the Orange County Arts Commission to bring more arts-focused content to our readers through columns written by local people about some of the fantastic things happening in our local arts scene!

The twang in her voice comes naturally.\n\nLandes calls it a \u201clilt,\u201d but she says, \u201cpeople have always thought I had a twang in my voice, and my parents were always like, where did that come from?\u201d\n\nA native of Indiana, she grew up mostly in Kentucky; Loretta Lynn once actually came to sing at the coal mine where her father worked. After graduating from New York University, Landes stuck around in the city to become part of its folk music scene and to build a career as a producer and sound engineer.\n\n2. She\u2019s attracted to the vintage Nashville \u201ccountrypolitan\u201d sound.\n\nLandes\u2019 musical output \u2013 five albums over the past 13 years \u2013 is an eclectic assortment of indy rock, folk, and pop sounds (including an entire album sung in French). But she\u2019s always been attracted to the lush sounds and legendary artists who came out of country in the 1960s. About four years ago, with more than a little bit of Dolly\u2019s register in her voice, she came in second at an annual competition in Sevierville, Tennessee, that honors Parton\u2019s songwriting.\n\n\u201cI did it on a whim,\u201d she says. \u201cMy friend dared me to enter it.\u201d\n\nTennessee continued to beckon, and after traveling to Nashville for songwriting sessions, Landes decided a couple of years ago that she had to record her own countrypolitan album.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was going for, but I didn\u2019t know how to get it myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought it would be great to work with someone who was sort of entrenched in the long-ago scene. I went straight to the source.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n3. She talked a country legend out of semi-retirement to produce the album.\n\nDetermined to produce an authentic sound, Landes set her sights on Fred Foster, the Hall of Fame member who was pivotal in the careers of Parton, Roy Orbison and Kris Kristofferson. Now 86, Foster hadn\u2019t produced an album since 2007 \u2013 and that one featured country deities Merle Haggard and Ray Price.\n\nBoldly, Landes cold-called Foster to plead her case. So what made him say yes?\n\n\u201cPart of it was persistence on my end,\u201d she says, but she finally won him over with her songwriting skills.\n\nTogether, they spent hours polishing the songs before she ever entered the studio; Foster then assembled a who\u2019s who list of studio musicians, including Hall of Famer Charlie McCoy. Even Hall of Fame artist Bobby Bare dropped by to serve as a sly foil on a duet.\n\n4. Landes now has a bona fide Loretta Lynn connection.\n\nAfter moving to Nashville last year, Landes answered a Craigslist ad and ended up buying a blue pickup from Lynn\u2019s music director, Bart Hansen. They have since become friends, and Hansen can be seen playing guitar, over Landes\u2019 right shoulder, in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. For that matter, the pickup is in the video, too, as well as a lyrical mention of \u201cLoretta on the radio.\u201d\n\nAt Hansen\u2019s behest, Landes recently home-recorded a video greeting to Lynn, whom Hansen visits weekly while she recuperates from a stroke and a broken hip.\n\n\u201cShe sent me one back,\u201d Landes marvels. \u201cCan you believe that? I have a video of Loretta saying hello to me and \u2018I hope you have a good day.\u2019 I love it so much.\u201d\n\nShervin Lainez\n\n5. She met her husband at music camp.\n\nOr, more formally, the prestigious Johnny Mercer Writers Colony, where both received grants in 2015 to work on full-length musicals.\n\nHusband Creighton Irons is an accomplished musical composer \u2014 and an incredibly supportive spouse who can be seen on the keyboard in the \u201cTraveling\u201d video. He also plans to join Landes on stage for at least a portion of the U.S. and European tour she\u2019ll be on through October to support the album.\n\nWhether their 1-year-old daughter, Callan, will be with them or with her grandparents has yet to be determined, but she\u2019s already well acquainted with Mom\u2019s new album. Not only has she attended recent shows, but Landes was pregnant during all of the recording sessions.\n\n\u201cShe was there the entire time, really,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope she likes it when she\u2019s older. I hope she\u2019s not like, \u2018All those songs!

The department offers both the bachelor of arts (B.A.) and the bachelor of music (B.Mus.) degrees for students majoring in music, and two minors. The department also offers many courses and performance opportunities to undergraduates majoring in fields other than music.\n\nAdmission\n\nStudents are admitted to the B.A. or B.Mus. programs through the regular admissions process established by the University. Prospective students intending to major in music are urged to contact the Department of Music for an audition during the year prior to their anticipated enrollment in order to strengthen their application credentials and to compete for scholarships offered by the department, including the prestigious William R.
