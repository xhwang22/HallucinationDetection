We have to make sure that we continue to play with pace. When we are at our best, we play with pace.\n\n\"... But there's no question, in this league, the more guys that can make a play offensively, the better. And the challenge again is making sure whatever you do around the margins of our roster, we have a unique identity and we have uniqueness in our size and our ability to be versatile all across the board, so we have to take that into account when we are adding to our team. But if we can maintain that and add some playmaking, yeah, without a doubt, you want to do that.\"\n\nThe Celtics certainly added some in landing the 29-year-old Brogdon, who averaged 19.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists in 36 games last season with Indiana.\n\nNot only does the versatile 6-foot-5 guard help Boston in a variety of ways offensively -- both as a passer and career 37.6% 3-point shooter -- but he is also another long, rangy defender to add to a stable of big guards for the Celtics that includes reigning Defensive Player of the Year Smart and Derrick White, whom Boston acquired at February's trade deadline.\n\nBoston landed Brogdon without sacrificing any of the top eight players from its playoff rotation. The Celtics could add a second player in the coming days, as sources told Wojnarowski that once the San Antonio Spurs finalize the expected release of forward Danilo Gallinari, his preference is to join Boston upon clearing waivers.\n\nThose additions would also address other needs -- depth and scoring off the bench -- that Stevens pointed out.\n\n\"I think we have to walk a fine line a little bit,\" Stevens said. \"I think teams are fragile. I think the way teams work together and operate together are fragile. And I think your identity as a team, when you find one that's successful, which we did this year on the defensive end of the floor and when we were at our best sharing the ball offensively, those things are fragile.\n\n\"So just to add doesn't mean that you're not taking something away from the group. And to change significant pieces in the group doesn't mean that that might not totally take your identity and shift it in a direction that's not as successful. And so it's quite a fine line. If you ask me right now what we need, I'd like to have a little bit more scoring -- consistent scoring -- off the bench. I think we have some short-term needs there.\"\n\nCeltics star Marcus Smart took to social media to say he was \"REALLY excited\" about the team's moves.\n\nMan REALLY excited about the moves we made today!!

They struck quickly with Jeremy Lamb but the bombshell \u2014 relatively speaking, of course \u2014 came with the sign-and-trade to bring in Malcolm Brogdon.\n\nPresident Kevin Pritchard has been preparing for this for months.\n\n\"I wanted to start getting a little bit more asset-rich,\" Pritchard said after the trade deadline passed in the first week of February. The Pacers received a future second-round pick from the Houston Rockets, who were trying to get under the luxury tax, so they unloaded some salaries that were absorbed by Indiana.\n\nHouston avoided the penalty because they had to get their salary total down before the end of the season. The Pacers, of course, gained an asset. They had the salary cap space to take on the contracts of Nik Stauskas and Wade Baldwin, though neither player was kept. They were paid and sent on their way.\n\nThen came the draft. Pritchard took a proven scorer in T.J. Warren from the Phoenix Suns, who were getting rid of his three years and $35 million, and relinquished a second-round pick, too. Pritchard then used that pick to choose a player out of Stanford for the Miami Heat and received three future seconds in return.\n\nFollow every game: Latest NBA Scores and Schedules\n\nAnd the 50th pick the Pacers owned themselves was traded to the Utah Jazz for a future second-rounder.\n\nMORE FROM FREE AGENCY\n\nAll of those moves put the Pacers, who have lost Darren Collison (retirement), Bojan Bogdanovic (Utah Jazz) and Thaddeus Young (Chicago Bulls), in position to retool.\n\nFor months, it was reported that the Pacers weren't in play for any game-changing free agents. It was understood around the league that the likes of Kyrie Irving, D'Angelo Russell or even a role player such as Danny Green weren't in range.\n\nThis is not just a smaller market, but Indiana's best player, Victor Oladipo, is out at least until December after right knee surgery. They haven't advanced out of the first round in the last two postseasons despite winning 48 games and being a No. 5 seed twice.\n\nSo Pritchard quietly put his ducks in a row to make a move. The Milwaukee Bucks, who had the league's best record in advancing to the conference finals, were in salary cap hell.\n\nBrogdon was a top target. Ricky Rubio, who was in the mix as well, ended up going to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nIf the Pacers had solely relied on free agency and didn't have the assets or cap space, the opposite likely happens.\n\nThe Pacers got younger in allowing over-30 players such as Bogdanovic and Young to leave (Collison was about to be 32 and Tyreke Evans 30 before he was suspended for two years for violating the league's anti-drug policy).\n\nThey've become more flexible. Getting swept by the Boston Celtics in the first round showed where they were at a deficit with players who weren't as interchangeable as Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Terry Rozier and Marcus Morris.\n\nBrogdon (four years, $85 million, plus a first-round and two second-round picks), entering his fourth season, can play both guard spots, which comes in handy because of Oladipo. He can shoot the 3 where he's at 40.8% for his career. The 2016 Rookie of the Year, he started 64 games and averaged 15.6 points and 3.2 assists for Milwaukee.\n\nLamb (three years, $31.5 million) is 27 and slots into shooting guard or small forward at 6-5. He's long and an average 3-point shooter for his career at 34%.\n\nHe averaged a career-high 15.3 points and 5.5 rebounds last season, his first as a starter. It was the fourth consecutive season raising his scoring average, from 6.3 in 2014-15 to 8.8 to 9.7 to 12.9 to 15.3.\n\nThe Pacers' only rotation guards on the roster were second-year players Aaron Holiday and Edmond Sumner. Both have shown promise. Sumner is 6-6, an exceptional athlete, incredibly lengthy and can play three positions. Sumner is negotiating a multi-year deal with the team instead of having his $1.5 million option picked up.\n\nPace, which the Pacers haven't been good at even when they've been playoff-good, should pick up. That means more possessions per game because they're playing at a higher speed.\n\nHoliday excels in setting tempo. Behind them, Myles Turner is the rim protector at 6-11, able to switch onto smaller players when needed.\n\nThe plan appears to be, at least in the short-term, to hold onto Domantas Sabonis and see if he can play with Turner more often. He's the post-up option while Turner faces up on the offensive end.\n\nThere's variety.\n\nThat's what the Celtics had and the Pacers did not. That's what the Cleveland Cavaliers had a season ago in being pushed to seven games, but the Pacers did not.\n\nMore moves will be made to fill out the roster, but the picture couldn't be more clear.\n\nPritchard told everyone what he was doing all along. Then he followed through with his vision.\n\nWhat more can be asked on Day 1 of free agency when the deck tends to be stacked against Indiana?\n\nThe Indianapolis Star is part of the USA TODAY Network."}, {"url": "https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2019/06/malcolm-brogdon-traded-to-pacers-agrees-to-deal-for-85-million-report.html", "page_content": "CLEVELAND, Ohio \u2014 Malcolm Brogdon is staying in the Central Division.

In 2021-22, he averaged 19.1 points, 5.9 assists and 5.1 rebounds over 36 games.\n\nBrogdon spent his first three seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks after being selected in the second round of the 2016 NBA Draft. He earned Rookie of the Year honors in 2017 and averaged 12.8 points, 3.6 assists and 3.5 rebounds per game in Milwaukee.\n\nIn 2019, the Pacers traded three picks to Milwaukee for Brogdon: 2020 first-rounder (used on R.J. Hampton); 2022 second-rounder; 2025 second-rounder.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon injury\n\nThe Pacers have played 237 regular-season games over the past three seasons, and Brogdon has appeared in 146 (62%). He missed 46 games in 2021-22 due to Achilles and hamstring injuries. He last appeared in a game on March 16.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon contract\n\nBrogdon is scheduled to count $22.6 million against the salary cap in 2022-23, which would have been the most on the Pacers. He signed an extension on Oct. 18, 2021, that runs through the 2024-25 season. He will count $22.5 million against the cap each season.\n\nWhat college did Malcolm Brogdon go to?\n\nBrogdon attended Virginia from 2011-16, where he was a three-year starter. His career averages were 13.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 2.5 assists. He was the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year in 2016.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon career highs\n\nPoints: 36 in a victory over the Toronto Raptors in the 2020-21 season\n\nAssists: 13 in a victory over the Brooklyn Nets in the 2019-20 season\n\nRebounds: 15 in an overtime loss to the Chicago Bulls in the 2020-21 season\n\nThis article originally appeared on Indianapolis Star: Malcolm Brogdon traded to Celtics, 3 years playing for Indiana Pacers"}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2730477-report-malcolm-brogdon-traded-to-pacers-agrees-to-4-year-85m-contract", "page_content": "Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMalcolm Brogdon was able to parlay his breakout 2018-19 season into a lucrative deal from the Indiana Pacers as part of a sign-and-trade agreement with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Brogdon's contract is worth $85 million over four years.\n\nWojnarowski added the Pacers will send Milwaukee three future draft picks, including one first-rounder, to complete the deal for Brogdon.\n\nBrogdon was a restricted free agent, but the Bucks opted not to re-sign their point guard after Wojnarowski reported Khris Middleton signed a five-year, $178 million deal with the team.\n\nA second-round pick by the Bucks in 2016, Brogdon quickly established himself as a valuable piece of the team's rotation. He was named the 2016-17 NBA Rookie of the Year after averaging 10.2 points and 4.2 assists in 75 games.\n\nThe 26-year-old was even better in 2017-18 with 13.0 points and 3.3 rebounds per game. He took his game to another level under head coach Mike Budenholzer last season, averaging a career-high 15.6 points and 4.5 rebounds while shooting 50.5 percent from the field.\n\nBrogdon led the NBA with a 92.8 free-throw percentage and became the first player since Stephen Curry in 2015-16 to join the 50-40-90 club last season. He missed the Bucks' first eight playoff games because of a torn plantar fascia in his right foot suffered in a March 15 game against the Miami Heat.\n\nLetting a player like Brogdon leave seems strange for a Milwaukee team that led the NBA with 60 wins. There are, unfortunately, practical concerns for the franchise to consider.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo is signed for two more seasons, but presumably the Bucks would like to work out an extension with their franchise player as soon as possible.\n\nBrogdon was a terrific steal for Milwaukee in the 2016 draft and could take the skills he learned to the Pacers.\n\n\n\nIndiana found a perfect player who fits what the team needed. Brogdon's ability to shoot gives the offense an element that was sorely lacking when Victor Oladipo's season ended in January with a ruptured quad tendon.\n\n\n\nBrogdon also offers the Pacers some insurance at the start of the season with the club expecting Oladipo to be out until at least December."}, {"url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/07/how-the-pacers-owner-helped-out-the-bucks-in-the-malcolm-brogdon-deal", "page_content": "The Indiana Pacers made a big splash in the offseason and have positioned themselves to be a darkhorse Finals pick in the Eastern Conference by adding Bucks star Malcolm Brogdon to a backcourt that will see the return of Victor Oladipo this coming season.\n\nBrogdon entered the summer as a restricted free agent with the Bucks, but it was expected that Brogdon could be on the move as he was likely to be too expensive for Milwaukee to retain without paying a hefty luxury tax bill. Brogdon received a 4-year deal worth $85 million with the Pacers \u2013 but only after Pacers owner Herb Simon offered to work out a sign-and-trade deal that would net the Bucks a few draft picks.\n\nESPN\u2019s Brian Windhorst reported that Simon informed the Bucks that he was prepared to offer Brogdon a contract that the Bucks likely couldn\u2019t match, but offered to make a trade deal as a showing of respect for his divisional rival.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re signing a restricted free agent, a lot of times you will give a toxic offer sheet. Poison pills, huge exploding salaries, front-end bonuses, options.

The Brooklyn Nets have given out several very toxic offer sheets in the last few years. \u2026.

We do not want to give a toxic offer sheet, I don\u2019t believe in doing that to a partner of mine. Can we work out a deal?\u2019 \u2026. It was a hell of a deal for the Bucks, because I don\u2019t think the Bucks were going to match an $85 million dollar offer. We\u2019ll never really know.\u201d\n\nInstead of losing Brogdon for nothing, the Bucks picked up three draft picks, which they can now either use to replenish their own roster or use as assets in deals moving forward.

I\u2019ll be honest, for a while, I was too! However, everyone who said the Bucks wouldn\u2019t win a championship because they let Brogdon go has an egg on their face. It\u2019s finally time we revisit this trade with open minds and open hearts because hey, the Bucks won a championship!\n\nOf course, the trade I am referring to is the Brogdon sign-and-trade deal to the Indiana Pacers from 2019, where the Bucks received three draft picks, with one being a first-round pick. Brogdon spent the first three seasons of his NBA career with the Bucks after being selected in the second round, 36th overall in the 2016 draft.\n\nBrogdon had a lot of success as a Buck, winning Rookie of the Year in 2016-17 and averaging 12.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 3.6 assists in 187 games (112 starts). He was one of the few hits the Bucks have gotten in the draft over the last 10 years, but he left the team as a restricted free agent to go to the Pacers.\n\nA lot was made of this trade when it happened and in the following three seasons. Brogdon has turned into a fantastic player for Indiana, as many expected he would. Personally, I don\u2019t hold any ill will towards Brogdon and I\u2019m glad he has been able to find a home with the Pacers and have a role he may not have had with the Bucks. Adam McGee did the initial grade for the deal, giving it a C letter grade, but let us go over it once again.\n\nThe financial impact of the Malcolm Brogdon trade for the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nPerhaps the biggest factor in some people\u2019s minds for the Brogdon trade was the financial aspect. Brogdon received a four-year, $85 million contract from the Pacers (well, technically the Bucks but you know what I mean) and for a lot of folks, it was seen as the Bucks being cheap and not wanting to pay Brogdon.\n\nThe Bucks did save on the luxury tax by not matching the offer that the Pacers gave Brogdon. I\u2019m sure that did play some part in why the Bucks chose not to bring him back, but as we\u2019ve seen, the Bucks have gone well into the luxury tax this offseason. I\u2019m not the person to defend owners not spending money, but they\u2019ve made it clear they\u2019ll spend into the tax.\n\nThe Bucks not bringing Brogdon back didn\u2019t create any extra space in the salary cap after they re-signed Brook Lopez that same offseason. It would have created a trade exception of around $10 million but due to some mismanagement of the cap with regards to the Lopez contract or Hill\u2019s guaranteed money, they did not get the trade exception.\n\nI still believe they should have matched the offer. The team was good enough to go into the tax for and Brogdon has proven to be worth the money, but we\u2019ll get into that now."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/4169820/2022/07/01/pacers-trading-malcolm-brogdon-to-celtics-source/", "page_content": "The Indiana Pacers and Boston Celtics agreed to a trade Friday, with the Pacers sending Malcolm Brogdon to Boston in exchange for a 2023 first-round pick, Daniel Theis and Aaron Nesmith a source confirmed to The Athletic.\n\nBrogdon, 29, joined Indiana in 2019 and played only 36 games this season due to Achilles pain. The 2017 Rookie of the Year averaged 19.1 points, 5.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists for the season,\n\nThe Pacers will receive former Celtics' first-round pick Nesmith, who has struggled with his shot since being drafted in 2020. Theis was reacquired by the Celtics in February and averaged 8.2 points and 4.9 rebounds per game in 2021-22 across 47 games with Houston and Boston.\n\n(Photo: Erik Williams / USA Today)\n\nGO DEEPER Malcolm Brogdon on trade from Pacers to Celtics: 'I'm looking to win a championship'\n\nGO DEEPER Grading the Malcolm Brogdon trade: Who won \u2014 Celtics or Pacers?\n\nHow does Brogdon fill a need for Boston?\n\nJay King, Celtics beat writer: The Celtics bench, solid over the latter half of the season, fell short during the finals. The Warriors exposed the lack of punch in Boston\u2019s second unit. Brogdon should address that issue. His recent string of injuries is a concern, but if he can stay on the court, his ballhandling, playmaking and shooting will all make a difference for the Celtics. As a sturdy, 6-foot-5 guard, he will be able to provide all that while fitting into Boston\u2019s defensive identity. He\u2019s just a great fit. And the Celtics acquired him without giving up anyone in their rotation full time.\n\nWhat are the Celtics\u2019 expectations for next season?\n\nKing: To compete for a championship. They have been aggressive already this offseason, as their acquisition of Brogdon (and all the future salary owed to him) shows. They still have a $17.1-million traded player exception to use if the right opportunity comes along, plus a number of smaller trade exceptions. After reaching the finals, the Celtics are loading up in hopes of making another run. They have used the early offseason to add around their young nucleus.\n\nWhat does this trade say about Indiana's trajectory?\n\nBob Kravitz, Indiana columnist: This deal is further confirmation that the Indiana Pacers are in full rebuild mode. Brogdon, 29, never quite fit the Pacers' timeline. That, and he was hurt a large portion of the time. This deal not only moves Indiana off Brogdon's deal and nets them a first-rounder but it also frees up money to perhaps make a run at a player like DeAndre Ayton. The Pacers are not interested in bottoming out, but they want to move forward with younger players like Tyrese Haliburton and first-round pick Bennedict Mathurin. Haliburton's numbers decreased last year when he played beside Brogdon. Time for a change."}]}
