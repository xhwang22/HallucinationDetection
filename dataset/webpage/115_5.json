{"Ha Jung-woo rose to fame with his leading role in The Chaser.": [{"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/movies/30chaser.html", "page_content": "True to its title, \u201cThe Chaser\u201d includes several hot pursuits. Forsaking cars and motorcycles, they involve men running up and down the steep, labyrinthine streets and alleys of the Mangwon neighborhood in western Seoul. When the quarry \u0097 a frog-eyed serial killer whose preferred tools are a hammer and chisel \u0097 is finally brought to ground, his exhausted pursuers beat him more from irritation than any desire to see justice done.\n\nThe sweaty low-tech action and the emphasis on urban topography link the film, the feature debut of the director Na Hong-jin, to modern South Korean classics like Lee Myung-se\u2019s propulsive cop drama \u201cNowhere to Hide,\u201d and Bong Joon-ho\u2019s river-monster thriller \u201cThe Host.\u201d Mr. Na isn\u2019t operating at that high a level, at least not yet. But with \u201cThe Chaser\u201d he\u2019s trying to chart a similar course between the poles of art-house pomposity and empty style that characterize so much of Korean moviemaking.\n\nThe result may be particularly appealing to American audiences: while many of his compatriots look to France (for cryptic game playing) and Japan (for glossy horror and violence), Mr. Na has his eye on Hollywood. \u201cThe Chaser\u201d evokes both film noir, in its conflicted hero and its moody shots of nighttime Seoul, and America\u2019s most influential 21st-century cultural export, the television police procedural, in its straightforward storytelling.\n\nStraightforward by Korean standards, anyway. Mr. Na and his co-screenwriters, Hong Wan-chon and Lee Shin-ho, mostly do without the mind-bending flashbacks, digressions and after-the-fact explanations that can make Korean thrillers seem fatally artificial to Western viewers. But their story does turn on several fairly astounding coincidences, the last abruptly shifting what had been a high-octane crime drama into a tragic key and dissipating much of the tension."}, {"url": "https://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/ha_jeong_u_2", "page_content": "Highest Rated: 100% Tunnel (2016)\n\nLowest Rated: 43% The Berlin File (2013)\n\nBirthday: Mar 11, 1978\n\nBirthplace: Seoul, South Korea\n\nHa Jung-woo was an actor who had a successful Hollywood career.

He was criticized for being a prolific actor where he always played a similar character and acted in the same way. In February, The Closet, produced and starred by Ha Jung Woo, failed to reach a break-even point and attracted only 1.2 million viewers. Of course it suffered from the aftermath of COVID-19, but the prevailing opinion is that the film is much less than expected.\n\nOn top of that, he was caught up in a controversy over his private life. When the hacking of celebrities\u2019 phones got surfaced, Ha Jung Woo was named as one of the victims. Despite the fact that he was a victim of a crime, he was suspected of having a fatal problem in his private life as he was threatened to pay several hundreds of thousands of dollars. To make matters worse, the public seemed to have turned their backs on him when he was reported to have habitually used propofol, a sedative drug.\n\nHowever, on April 20, negative public opinion about the actor took a drastic turn when Dispatch unveiled the conversation between Ha Jung Woo and the hacker. One of the hackers revealed that he had obtained information by hacking into Ha Jung Woo\u2019s phone and stated that he would dispose of all the data if he pays 1.5 billion KRW (approx. 1,216,290 USD). In response, Ha Jung Woo persistently continued messaging with the hacker after reporting to the police, giving the police the time to investigate further.\n\nIn the process, he toyed with the hacker using his unique sly manner. He continued sitcom-like conversation, like \u201cLet\u2019s talk slowly. 1.3 billion isn\u2019t a dog\u2019s name. You know I gotta sell both my pear and radish fields. Or I\u2019ll give you the pear field, so why don\u2019t you sell it,\u201d \u201cI got such goosebumps that I am living like a goose,\u201d and \u201cChange your profile picture.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the police secured the crucial IP address and arrested two hackers.\n\nPublic opinion seems to have turned around to some extent as the witty conversation that played a great tole in catching the criminals has been released. However, there are still doubts about his alleged propofol usages. Some even raise suspicions that Ha Jung Woo may be trying to \u201cchange the subject\u201d by revealing the conversation with the hackers\n\nCurrently, a separate investigation is undergoing regarding the actor\u2019s propofol case. According to the agency, no schedule has been set Ha Jung Woo\u2019s summons to the prosecution yet.\n\nSource (1, 2)"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/ha-jung-woo/", "page_content": "Ha Jung-woo (born Kim Sung-hoon on March 11, 1978) is a South Korean actor and film director. Ha studied theater at Chung-Ang University, and after several years of minor and supporting parts, he was cast in his first starring role in the low-budget indie The Unforgiven (2005), directed by his friend Yoon Jong-bin. This was followed by Kim Ki-duk's Time (2006), and Never Forever (2007) with Vera Farmiga. But his breakthrough role to stardom was in Na Hong-jin's serial killer film The Chaser (2008). Known to attract both critical acclaim and commercial success, Ha quickly became the most in-demand leading actor of his generation in Korean cinema, showcasing his versatility in road movie My Dear Enemy (2008), sports film Take Off (2009), crime drama The Yellow Sea (2010), gangster saga Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time (2012), romantic comedy Love Fiction (2012), spy thriller The Berlin File (2013), and action thriller The Terror Live (2013). He made his directorial debut through the comedy film Fasten Your Seatbelt (2013), followed by Chronicle of a Blood Merchant (2015).\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn as Kim Sung-hoon, Ha Jung-woo came from an acting family. His father Kim Yong-gun is a well-known veteran actor who has appeared in many movies and television series, while his younger brother Kim Young-hoon (stage name: Cha Hyun-woo) is an aspiring actor. Ha has said that since he was 4 or 5 years old, he has always dreamed of becoming an actor like his father. Before entering college, Ha studied at a private acting institute and at one point had actor Lee Beom-soo as his instructor. He then enrolled at Chung-Ang University as a theater major, where he acted on the stage.\n\nIn 1998, Ha began his military service, working in the Armed Forces Public Relations Department. He put his acting experience to good use during this time, appearing in 10 promotional films for the military.\n\nCareer\n\nHa made his acting debut in the 2002 SBS sitcom Honest Living and his feature film debut in the 2003 film Madeleine. For the next few years, Ha's acting career was relatively low-key, appearing in several supporting roles, but not receiving a lot of attention. Things started to change in 2005. He signed with talent agency SidusHQ and on their recommendation adopted the stage name \"Ha Jung-woo.\" Ha would also appear in his first starring role in the indie film The Unforgiven - a blistering critique of the physical and psychological violence within military ranks. He then appeared in controversial arthouse director Kim Ki-duk's Time and Breath, which brought more notice to his acting talents in Korea and overseas. During this time, his portrayal of a cool-headed prosecutor who is romantically involved with a feisty police officer played by Go Hyun-jung in the popular MBC drama series H.I.T attracted more female fans. He also starred in the American indie film Never Forever opposite Vera Farmiga, which garnered praise from the film festival circuit.\n\nHa's breakout came in the 2008 film The Chaser, in which he played a character loosely based on serial killer Yoo Young-chul. The movie became a huge hit at the Korean box office, raking in over 5 million ticket sales, while also garnering high praise from critics and numerous awards from local award-giving bodies. Ha's portrayal of a psychopath, coupled with his performance as a charming scoundrel in My Dear Enemy that same year, showcased his versatility and elevated his status as one of the most sought-after actors in the Korean film industry. Since The Chaser, Ha has worked virtually non-stop for the next several years, taking on diverse but compelling roles in The Moonlight of Seoul, Boat, and Take Off. Take Off, based on the Korean national ski jumping team, became one of the biggest box office hits of 2009.\n\nAmerican director Martin Scorsese, rumored to be attached to a Hollywood remake of The Chaser, has complimented Ha as having as much potential as his The Departed stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon.\n\nHa reunited with his The Chaser director Na Hong-jin and costar Kim Yoon-seok in Na's sophomore feature The Yellow Sea, which netted Ha Best Actor trophies from the Asian Film Awards, Baeksang Arts Awards and the Korean Association of Film Critics.\n\nHa said the legal thriller The Client evoked his early days of theater, and the director praised Ha for his \"moments of true brilliance and genius\" during the production.\n\nIn early 2012, Samsung Electronics produced an ambitious PPL-frequent-film project featuring Galaxy Note, their latest Tablet hybrid mobile. Titled as Cine Note, the giant project comprises three shorts by directors Kang Hyeong-cheol, Jang Hoon and E J-yong. Ha played the leading role for all the three of the films, while celebrated musician Lee Seung-chul produced music using the device, and noted webtoon artists Son Jae-ho and Lee Gwang-soo created the film\u2019s animated content.\n\nNameless Gangster: Rules of the Time was Ha's third collaboration with longtime friend director Yoon Jong-bin, also starring acclaimed veteran actor Choi Min-sik. This was followed shortly by the unconventional romantic comedy Love Fiction opposite Gong Hyo-jin. Both were box office hits.\n\nAfter wrapping Love Fiction, Ha along with Gong and 14 other actors went on a cross-country walking trip from Seoul to Haenam, South Jeolla Province. Their journey was chronicled in the documentary 577 Project, denoting the total distance covered in kilometers. Ha was in charge of three aspects of the production including planning, acting and casting. He said he did it to thank fans for their support after he won back-to-back Best Actor awards at the 2010 and 2011 Baeksang Arts Awards.\n\nIn Ryoo Seung-wan's The Berlin File, Ha starred as a North Korean agent in Berlin who is betrayed and cut loose in the midst of a financial espionage intrigue. Together with his wife (a translator at the embassy played by Jun Ji-hyun), they try to escape being purged, with Ryoo Seung-bum and Han Suk-kyu playing North and South Korean operatives on their trail.\n\nHe appeared in 90% of the action thriller The Terror Live, playing a news anchor with an exclusive, live broadcast on a terrorist attack.\n\nHa then made his directorial debut with Rollercoaster (released internationally as Fasten Your Seatbelt), based on his own screenplay about the comic interactions between the cabin crew and passengers (including an arrogant Hallyu star played by Jung Kyung-ho) of a flight from Tokyo to Gimpo International Airport which becomes in danger of crashing when the plane hits a major storm.\n\nWorking with Yoon Jong-bin again, Ha played a Joseon era butcher-turned-outlaw in the period action film Kundo: Age of the Rampant.\n\nIn 2015, Ha directed, wrote and starred in Chronicle of a Blood Merchant, a film adaptation of Chinese author Yu Hua's 1995 novel. He then appeared in one of the biggest domestic hits of the year, Choi Dong-hoon's Assassination about resistance fighters given orders to kill a Japanese army commander in the colonial era.\n\nHa has been cast in several upcoming films: a biopic on Andre Kim, Korea's first male fashion designer (Ha previously worked with director Son Young-sung on The Client); Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden, an adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel Fingersmith also set during 1930s Korea; and Kim Yong-hwa's With God, an adaptation of the same-titled webtoon about a court in the afterlife where the deceased undergo multiple trials for 49 days (Kim also directed Take Off).\n\nOther activities\n\nHa Jung-woo is also an artist. Though it began as a hobby in his university days, Ha began painting in earnest in 2007. His paintings, all done in a hybrid of Pop art and Expressionist styles, have been displayed in several solo art exhibitions. Critics have said his paintings, with their strong colors and interesting composition are reminiscent of those by American artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. \"Life as an actor is like living through an invisible war. Paintings soothe me and make me rational. It is too extravagant to say that painting is my hobby; it is rather a way for me to survive as an actor,\" said Ha.\n\nIn 2011 he published a compilation of essays titled Ha Jung-woo, Good Feeling. Besides his musings on life, Ha also wrote his thoughts on famous artists such as Pablo Picasso. The book also included about 60 of his own drawings.\n\nPersonal life\n\nHa dated fashion model Gu Eun-ae from August 2008 to January 2012.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nAs actor\n\nYear Korean Title English Title Role Production Company 2003 \ub9c8\ub4e4\ub80c Madeleine Joon-ho Cinema Service 2004 \uc288\ud37c\uc2a4\ud0c0 \uac10\uc0ac\uc6a9 Superstar Mr. Gam Kim Yoo-weol CJ Entertainment 2005 \uc7a0\ubcf5\uadfc\ubb34 She's on Duty Detective Jo Showbox \uc6a9\uc11c\ubc1b\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \uc790 The Unforgiven Yoo Tae-jeong Chungeorahm 2006 \uc2dc\uac04 Time Ji-woo Happinet Pictures Korea \uad6c\ubbf8\ud638 \uac00\uc871 The Fox Family Son fox MK Pictures 2007 \ub450\ubc88\uc9f8 \uc0ac\ub791 Never Forever Kim Ji-ha Prime Entertainment\n\nArts Alliance \uc228 Breath Yeon's husband Sponge Entertainment 2008 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc0dd\uc560 \ucd5c\uace0\uc758 \uc21c\uac04 Forever the Moment Blind date man Sidus FNH \ucd94\uaca9\uc790 The Chaser Je Yeong-min Showbox \ube44\uc2a4\ud2f0 \ubcf4\uc774\uc988 Beastie Boys Jae-hyun Lotte Entertainment \uc6b8\ud559\uad50 \uc774\ud2f0 Our School's E.T.

How do you go about preparing for a specific role and do your preparations differ between films that are largely story-based and those that are essentially character studies?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Basically, I am full of curiosity and I am very interested in people. In fact, I love people. I normally get my first ideas about a specific character I am to play from screenwriters but in Korea most directors are also screenwriters so I always ask directors lots of questions like \u201cHow did this character start out\u201d or \u201cHow did you begin to develop this character\u201d. Essentially, I do a lot of research about a character whether it is for a story-led film or a character study and that\u2019s how I build the way in which I will play the role. For example, the character I played in \u2018My Dear Enemy\u2019 was actually modelled on the director\u2019s friend and so I was able to learn a great deal about him by asking the director. I read lots of novels, too, and that also helps to build up characters, in general. For each role I play, I endeavour to take on the persona of a real-life person to make the character more believable. If you take the example of \u2018The Chaser\u2019, you probably know that the character I played was a real person in Korea, the film was based on a real story, and so I looked into the police investigations of the case and how the main investigator had written descriptions of that person in his reports and how he had detailed that person\u2019s reactions to questions so that when the police interrogated the suspect in the film I could make my reactions as true-to-life as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 was your directorial debut. Why did you decide to move into directing and what were the challenges you faced directing the film?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Being a director has always been part of my plan. It\u2019s not a new idea, I always intended to direct as well as act. I love working around films and yes, of course, I began my career as solely an actor but my plan for the future is to be both an actor and director. As far as the challenges of directing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 are concerned, as I am an actor and I know how acting works I probably expected too much from the actors involved and perhaps my aim wad too high. \u2018The Terror Live\u2019 \u2013 the film that is screening tonight \u2013 was filmed right after I finished directing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 and because of that I was able to understand the director to a far greater degree \u2013 having been a director myself, I was able to communicate a lot better with the director of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019. Communication is, of course, very important in day-to-day life but it\u2019s even more so in film.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: I\u2019d like to ask you about Ryoo Seung-wan\u2019s \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 which I think was really your first much more straightforward action film; in terms of stunts and particularly the martial arts sequences. How did you find the training for the film and was the chance of doing some of that work what attracted you to the role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I\u2019ve always very much liked director Ryoo Seung-wan\u2019s action films and we always had a plan to work together on a film. However, we were unsure of what project that would be until \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 came up, and that was the film we ultimately ended up working on together. In my opinion, I would say \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 is a drama rather than an action film, but there we go, and for the action scenes I just did what I was told by the fight choreographer. I did a bit of action before but as an agent doing martial arts \u2018The Berlin File\u2019 was the first time so I guess because I felt I had no real experience I went to train at \u2018stunt school\u2019 and practiced rally hard; basically starting from learning how to punch properly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: You\u2019ve mentioned acting and directing. I believe you have a film coming up called \u2018Chronicle of a Blood Merchant\u2019, based on a Chinese novel, in which you act and direct at the same time. I wondered how that came about. Was it something you were a fan of or did someone else approach you?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Because it\u2019s a very interesting, funny story is the main reason I chose to work on \u2018Chronicle of a Blood Merchant\u2019. About two years ago, I received a novel from a production company and the CEO of the production company is actually a friend of the writer. Initially I was offered a job as an actor in the production. The story, as I\u2019ve said, was really interesting but I felt I was too young to play the character so at that time I refused. Two years later, the same CEO came to see me on the set of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019 and said there was no time to waste as the publication rights were close to running out, but I still refused because I\u2019m in my 30s [Ha Jung-woo laughs] and I told him if the rights could be extended to when I turn 40 then I would be interested. Just a couple of days later, he came back and said he had asked the writer if he could wait but he was unable to as the film would soon be made in China, anyway. The CEO said how much he loved the story and how he really wanted to see the film made in Korea and he agreed that he would be happy as long as it was done by 2014. So, shooting will go ahead next May. As I said, up to that point I was only going to be an actor in the film but after I accepted the role we met up to discuss who would be the director. Around the same time, I was editing \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 and there were some good rumours going round the editing room and shortly after that I heard that I had been chosen as the director, too. That was a proposal that really made my heart leap and so I accepted the offer.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: Do any of the roles you play affect you outside of shooting? In \u2018The Chaser\u2019, for example, you play a very sadistic character. Is it difficult to switch off once shooting ends for the day?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I don\u2019t find it hard to switch off because when one role is close to completion I\u2019m always thinking of the next role to move on to. I try very hard not to bring what happens on set into my home and I make a real effort to separate my work and home life. I guess that\u2019s why I find it fairly easy to switch off from a specific character.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: You appeared in two of director Kim Ki-duk\u2019s films, \u2018Breath\u2019 and \u2018Time\u2019. I wondered what it was like working with director Kim as he seems to be quite hard on his actors to get the performance he wants out of them?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I know it\u2019s rumoured that he\u2019s quite hard on actors but he wasn\u2019t like that at all when we worked together, and for me it was an absolute honour to have the chance to work with him. When you shoot a film, normally you met up to read the script together and that\u2019s how you first met and get to know the character you\u2019re going to play, etc. But with Kim Ki-duk there was no reading of the script for \u2018Time\u2019, and I don\u2019t know if he always does this or if it was just the case for this film, but he said the acting and building of the character was basically down to me, in a very trusting way. Eight years ago, I was quite a \u2018newbie\u2019 and I didn\u2019t have that much experience at the time, but the whole shoot was so comfortable I was really amazed that director Kim let me to decide on the character and the way to act. It was all done very comfortably and pleasurably as if I was working with my friends, unlike the rumour [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. When we worked on our second film together, \u2018Breath\u2019, it felt like we didn\u2019t talk about the film; we just talked about other things, really.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: You seem to be a multi-talented actor and director in the vein of James Franco; an American, he too acts, directs, he writes and he also paints. I know that you do painting as well, and I actually went to one of your exhibitions three years ago. What is it about painting that you enjoy? Do you feel it allows you to express something different to that of your films?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: When I graduated from university, I was practically unemployed. Obviously, I went for auditions but I had no tomorrow or certain future and it seemed just a continual repeat of mundane life. As such, I really wanted to do something creative and one day I just went to an art shop and bought a sketch book and paints and began painting. I found that while painting I was able to get rid of those worries about my future and it largely became both my life and my hobby. Once I began to get acting roles, my career moved up but still at times as an actor I\u2019ve felt quite isolated and my painting has served as a way to get rid of that feeling and discharge that emotion. On the set, I\u2019m forced to be logical and the director but I can feel quite emotional when I come home sometimes, whether I feel I did a good job of acting or not, and I guess when I see the end result of my painting it refreshes my mind and alleviates that stress. I guess my painting is my emotional diary.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoreaffinity: I\u2019ve been wondering why directors like Na Hong-jin and Ryoo Seung-wan are always choosing you to run in films. What do you think directors see in you that makes them cast you in such roles; your characters often escaping from one place to another?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Maybe because I was born in the year of the horse [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. Na Hong-jin and Ryoo Seung-wan, after \u2018The Chaser\u2019 etc, recommended me to other directors saying \u201cYou\u2019ve got to make him run, and your film will definitely be successful\u201d [Ha Jung-woo laughs, again].\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: If I could just add to that, you also have a lot of eating scenes. Is that a special skill, too?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I always make sure they bring out hot food that you can actually eat, rather than just looking nice. In \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019, as you likely remember, there were many eating scenes; eating potatoes and hot dogs and they were really, really hot too \u2013 almost too hot to eat \u2013 and that really helped to make it more real and made expression easier. In Korea, there are many captured clips from films of me eating, with many of them online, and when I go to a restaurant with my friends there will always be one or two people filming me eating [Ha Jun-woo laughs]. So, it\u2019s really difficult for me to eat out in public. These days, when I see people in certain postures or making specific gestures, I know that they\u2019re trying to film me.\n\n\n\n\n\nCine_Asie: You come from a family of actors: Your father was a famous TV actor and your brother has started appearing in more and more television dramas, as well. When you started your career you acted in a TV series and you have since moved away into acting in films and have also added directing to your career. Earlier in the year, we met director Ryoo Seung-wan who has worked with his brother and as your brother is an actor, so far mostly in TV, are you considering working with him in film?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Once I get more experience as a director then I should be able to cast my brother in a film. I think to shoot a film together as a family, rather than just being in a film as an actor, would be a good experience and something to remember.\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: Tonight, there will be a screening of \u2018The Terror Live\u2019. How did you prepare yourself to be in character Young-hwa\u2019s shoes as a news announcer in a very tight space; two locations within a news room?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I don\u2019t think the small space matters that much. It\u2019s more about how the audience will see the film without feeling bored \u2013 because a newsroom is essentially a boring space. We talked a great deal about how to ensure the audience wouldn\u2019t feel bored in the space; different camera work, different cuts, and the use of multi-camera shots. The film comprises of 21 chapters and each chapter lasts for between five and ten minutes and we wanted to have a \u2018live\u2019 feel to it almost like a theatre. So, we shot non-stop for each chapter. The director had prepared for the film for five years and had prepared in such depth that he had shots from other films that he used and combined within the construct of the script and he showed me the demo film he had made. I think that in itself shows how much preparation he undertook.\n\n\n\n\n\nHangul Celluloid: On a much more general subject, I have spoken to a lot of actors and directors who have talked about the difficulties faced by smaller independent film productions as a result of Korean film studios\u2019 continued focus on large budget blockbusters. As you are both an actor and a director, what are your thoughts on that issue?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I think the actual number of smaller film productions has increased in recent years because it\u2019s now so much easier to film in numerous ways; even with a mobile phone, as has been done on more than one occasion in Korea. So, even though there is indeed still ongoing pressure from large Korean film companies and studios for films that are either large budget blockbusters or almost certain money makers, I believe that the passion of those people who truly love films will enable small and independent films to continue to exist and even flourish.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: I wanted to ask you about EJ Yong\u2019s film-within-a-film \u2018Behind the Camera\u2019, which you star in: Working with all those big name stars over what I believe was a tight two-day shooting schedule, what was it like working with a director who wasn\u2019t on set or even in the same country, for that matter?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: It was amazing [Ha Jung-woo laughs]. To make it worse, I was working with EJ Yong on a different short film at the same time. So, in \u2018Behind the camera\u2019 I had a very small part and in the other short film I was the main actor. Director EJ Yong had a very clever idea to produce the film and we accomplished it through online chatting. I actually had another camera and I thought it was filming me, but it turned out it was just filming the background. In relation to the previous question about independent productions, because of directors like EJ Yong I don\u2019t think low budget films will disappear.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: You mentioned working with EJ Yong on another film and you have worked with other directors more than once, like Lee Yoon-ki, Kim Ki-duk, and Na Hong-jin. Is there one director you would still like to work with a second time, in the future?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Of course. I have talked about doing another film with director Kim Byung-woo, but we haven\u2019t decided on anything specific at this point. I feel very blessed and lucky to have met such good directors throughout my career and having good people around me has regularly made me want to work with a director on more than one film.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 premiered at this year\u2019s Busan International Film Festival. How did it feel to have your directorial debut premiere at such a prestigious film festival?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I went to the Busan Film Festival in 2005 with \u2018The Unforgiven\u2019 as an actor and then this year I was invited to go as a director. So, it felt really great and the festival itself felt very different going in as a director and I felt much closer to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: A number of Korean actors and directors have tried to make or appear in films in the US. You appeared in a US/South Korean film by Gina Kim [Never Forever] but would you choose to appear in or direct a film in the US?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I do have plans to, and I\u2019d also like to but I can\u2019t really say much about that specifically, at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Global Impact: Could you tell us a little bit about your next project \u2018Kundo\u2019 which I believe is a historical film? Is it more difficult or more fun to play in an historical film rather than a modern role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: It\u2019s not fun at all. In the summer, Korea was very hot and I had to wear long trousers and big boots - layers and layers of clothing - and I had a shaved head and I had to have a beard and wear burnt make-up. So, it was incredibly difficult. There were also many horse-riding scenes and because it was so hot, the horses wouldn\u2019t listen or do what they were told. Nothing was easy at any given time during shooting. People might think that having a shaved head would be cool, but I spent so long in the sun that at night I could even feel the heat coming up again. So, I was able to learn quite a lot about solar energy [Ha Jung-woo laughs].\n\n\n\n\n\nKoreaffinity: Prior to \u2018Project 577\u2019 you made a promise to the Korean people that resulted in a beautiful documentary about Korea. Do you feel you freed your spirit and do you think the rest of the actors hate you now? [In 2010, Ha Jung-woo won an award at the PaekSang Arts Awards and promised he would walk across Korea if he won the award again\u2026 He won the award the subsequent year and convinced some acting friends to go with him on his 577km journey to fulfil that promise].\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: After that incident, I\u2019ve never talked about anything like that again but through that three week cross-country walking trip I learnt a lot and realised that parts of Korea I didn\u2019t know about are really beautiful. I was lucky that Korea is small [Ha Jung-woo laughs].\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: You have been in a number of action films, The Chaser, \u2018Yellow Sea, \u2018The Berlin File\u2019, and normally no stunt men are used and you have to do the action scenes yourself. How do you endure the pain until the director says \u201cOk, that\u2019s the perfect shot\u201d?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I didn\u2019t do all the action and fighting scenes myself. There is a \u2018double\u2019 who looks exactly like me from the back. So, it wasn\u2019t all me.\n\n\n\n\n\nHangul Celluloid: You are almost instantly recognisable in the majority of your roles but in 2006 you played a far less recognisable part in \u2018The Fox Family\u2019. What specific difficulties were there in working in a musical fantasy as opposed to a straightforward action film or drama and what attracted you to the role?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: When I received the script, I was very much reminded of Tim Burton\u2019s work and I tried to get the feel for the character from his films. That\u2019s also what attracted me to the part and though I\u2019m not sure how audiences felt about the role I played it was Burton\u2019s work that I based my performance on. As far as the musical aspect of the film and the dancing sequences are concerned, because I began my career as a theatre actor I didn\u2019t find any real difficulty in performing as I was required to.\n\n\n\n\n\neasternKicks: You\u2019ve been lucky to never have been typecast \u2013 you\u2019ve played in a variety of roles from romantic lead to spy to serial killer. I wondered what sort of roles you like playing most and is there anything you\u2019d like to try that you haven\u2019t yet?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: My dream role would be Hamlet on stage because I did theatre studies and being Hamlet to any theatre actor is a blessing and an honour. I was actually offered a job in 2009 but as I was so busy making \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019 I wasn\u2019t able to do it, but hopefully before I get too old I\u2019ll get the opportunity to play Hamlet. Choi Min-sik, who I believe was here in England recently, played Hamlet in 1999 and ten years later to celebrate the role I was offered the part, but as I said I was at that time too busy to accept.\n\n\n\n\n\nMini Mini Movies: We talked about the directing of \u2018Fasten Your Seatbelt\u2019 but as far as the writing is concerned did you have some collaboration?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Obviously I got ideas from the actors and actresses involved when we were reading the script but the film was actually based on a real story, experienced by Ryoo Seung-beom.\n\n\n\n\n\nKorean Class Massive: What has been the most physically demanding role you\u2019ve had to date?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: Without question, \u2018Kundo\u2019 was by far the most physically demanding as a result of the heat alone. In that film I was using a very knife while the other actor was using a long sword and I was worried that I might actually get cut or injured. Whenever I talk about physically demanding roles, \u2018Kundo\u2019 will always be the one I mention. Before that film, I would probably have said \u2018Yellow Sea\u2019 because the shooting was for 11 months and also took place in suburban China.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriental Nightmares: Who are the directors and actors who have inspired you throughout your career?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: There are many: Martin Scorsese, Woody Allen, Tim Burton, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Downey Jr, even perhaps James Franco [Ha Jung-woo laughs]\n\n\n\n\n\nSumGyeoJin Gem: Choi Min-sik is going to star in Luc Besson\u2019s \u2018Lucy\u2019 with Scarlett Johansson. Are you interested in working with foreign directors and cast members in order to extend your work in terms of different cultures\u2019 film productions?\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo: I am open to the idea. In fact, I had a call from South Africa at one point but I thought it was too far to go. Hopefully at some point in the future a suitable opportunity will arise.\n\nOn behalf of everyone involved, I'd sincerely like to thank the Korean Cultural Centre UK for allowing us all to interview actor Ha Jung-woo at such length. Also, many thanks to Sinae Hong for her superb interpreting throughout the interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2015/10/21/etc/Ha-Jungwoo-to-star-in-With-God-movie/3010579.html", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nHa Jung-woo to star in \u2018With God\u2019 movie\n\nHa Jung-woo, one of the most prolific actors in the Korean film scene, has signed on to appear in a new film, \u201cWith God,\u201d according to Fantagio, the 37-year-old actor\u2019s agency.In the much-anticipated film based on the popular web cartoon series of the same name, Ha will play the role of a man who is escorted to the afterworld after his death and spends 49 days there with other deceased people to await multiple trials.The actor has played supporting roles in numerous films and drama series since his 1998 debut, but the 2008 hit film \u201cThe Chaser\u201d brought him fame and popularity. In the film, Ha plays the role of a serial killer.Since then, Ha has been keeping his schedule full.Over the past three years, he has appeared in six films, including \u201cAssassination\u201d (2015) and \u201cKundo: Age of Rampant\u201d (2014), and also directed and starred in \u201cChronicle of a Blood Merchant\u201d (2015).Apart from \u201cWith God,\u201d Ha also signed on to three other films: \u201cAgasshi,\u201d \u201cTunnel\u201d and \u201cAndre Kim.\u201dMeanwhile, director Kim Yong-hwa of \u201cMr. Go\u201d (2013) and \u201cTake Off\u201d (2009) will take the helm of \u201cWith God.\u201d Both Kim and Ha worked together on \u201cTake Off.\u201dBy Sung So-young"}, {"url": "https://seoulspace.com/the-greatest-korean-actors-of-all-time-updated/", "page_content": "How do you rank the greatest Korean Actors of all time? This is impossible to do unless you set up some guidelines. Performances come in various types based on the genre and the era they occurred. Judging a great comedic performance next to a great dramatic one is difficult. In addition, actors today have much more freedom to push the boundaries than in Korean films in the past. With the success of Parasite and the demand for more Korean film recommendations, many Korean films are getting a look from the global audience for the first time.\n\nHere are our guidelines to do the Top 10 Greatest Korean Actors correctly.\n\nThe number of awards won for their acting\n\nThe number of memorable characters played\n\nHow many films have they done? Experience matters.\n\nCan they play a range of characters?\n\nReviews from critics\n\nWe have also done an article on the Greatest Korean Actresses of all time which you should check out.\n\nSong Kang-ho\n\nIf Choi Min Sik brings explosive passion to a role, Song Kang-ho is like a professional surgeon. Every mannerism, line delivery, and facial expression feels calculated to the tee. He can express so much while showing very little emotion. Best of all, he seems to be getting better with age. His recent work in Parasite might be his best work to date. Song Kang-ho\u2019s career has spanned three decades.\n\nFor the last decade, there has been a debate in the Korean film industry on who is the best actor, Choi Min Sik or Song Kang-ho. I would argue that Song Kang-ho has passed Choi due to his performance in Parasite. In addition, Song Kang-ho can unexpectedly be funny when a role calls for it and completely transform himself into the characters he plays. Don\u2019t believe me? Watch Memories of Murder and The Host. Choi, on the other hand, tends to play the same character usually.\n\nChoi Min Sik\n\nWhen discussing Choi Min Sik\u2019s career, two words come to mind, explosive and intense. Choi Min Sik is phenomenal. You always feel that this man loves the craft of acting and being able to perform. His performance in Old Boy is all you need to watch to see how great an actor Choi Min Sik is. However, Choi Min Sik seems to play the same intense and worn-down character. Yet, Choi Min Sik has proven he takes a particular character and plays it better than anyone in Korean cinema. He has been at the top of all lists for Korean actors for many decades and is still strong today. Check him out in one of the best Korean horror movies of all time, I Saw the Devil.\n\nMake sure to see the Korean version and not the Korean remake by Spike Lee.\n\nLee Jung-jae\n\nLee Jung-jae is one of the most successful actors in South Korea. Many global audiences first saw him in the Netflix hit Squid Game; however, Lee Jung-jae has been acting since 1994. He has starred in various film genres, from romance to comedies to action. There is no role he can\u2019t play. His role in Squid Game earned him the Gallup Korea\u2019s Film Actor of the Year, and he was nominated for the 2022 Golden Globes for Best Actor in a TV drama.\n\nAhn Sung Ki\n\nIt is difficult summing up how large of an impact Ahn Sung Ki has had on Korean Cinema. His rise to stardom came in the 80s and continues to flourish today. What makes Ahn Sung Ki such a draw is his ability to combine raw intensity that makes his performances feel feal and emotional. His roles in the 80s are perhaps his best work, where he won 5 Baeksang Arts Awards. He has set a gold standard for actors in Korea and is one of the most respected actors working today. He has appeared in over 140 films over 60 years.\n\nLee Byung Hun\n\nWhile many in the United States might know Lee Byung Hun from G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra as Storm Shadow. He is one of the most famous and best looking Korean actors today. In addition, he has gotten critical acclaim for his roles in JSA, The Good, The Bad, the Weird, and Inside Men. He became the first Korean actor to present an Oscar at the Academy Awards and was one of the first Korean actors to imprint his hands and foot at Grauman\u2019s Chinese Theatre. Lee Byung Hun has developed a reputation in Korea as an actor with a fierce dedication to commercial and critical film roles.\n\nSol Kyung-gu\n\nSol Kyung-gu is an actor that is known for playing both comedic roles and dramatic roles very well. Everyone in Korea knew he was a top-quality actor, but it took some time before he got the recognition he deserved. He was great in the romantic comedy I Wish I Had a Wife in 2001. As well as the war drama Silmido. He got a lot of respect from the acting community in Korea for his role in Rikidozan, where he gained over 40 pounds and did most of his lines in Japanese. Sol Kyung-gu continues to give great performances, such as in Man to Men, The Merciless, and Memoir of a Murderer.\n\nHwang Jung-min\n\nHwang Jung-min started acting in 2001 and has made at least two films yearly. One of the best movies by Hwang Jung-min is Ode to My Father, where he brought a lot of heart to the film. Most might know him from his role in The Wailing, one of the scariest Korean films of all time. He played one of the creepiest characters in Korean cinema.\n\nJeong Jae-yeong\n\nJeong Jae-yeong is an old-school Korean actor known for his roles in Silmido, Welcome to Dongmakgol, and On the Beach at Night Alone. He is not active as he used to be, and he will be lucky if he does a film a year. However, when he does, he is constantly recognized for his great work. He has won many awards and is known for his ability to play various roles.\n\nHa Jung-woo\n\nHere is a Korean actor rising the ranks and should be in the top 5 when his career is all said and done. Ha Jung-woo is not only an actor but also a director, screenwriter, and producer. He pretty much does it all. Ha Jung-woo is considered one of the highest-grossing actors in South Korea. He came to fame from his magnificent performance in The Chaser in 2008. You compare that to his performance in the sports film Take Off, and you can see just how good his range is. Check out Ha Jung-woo in one of the top Korean films of all time, The Handmaiden.\n\nKim Yoon-Seok\n\nOne of the most respected Korean actors around, Kim Yoon-Seok has a background in the theater, where he perfected his acting craft on stage.
