PACAUD (Megantic):\n\nMr, Speaker, in rising to take part in this debate, I do so with no intention of discussing at any length the resolutions presented to us for our consideration. I do not pretend to be able to handle this great question, involving as it does so many important features of financial intricacies. But, Sir, the discussion that has been going on, the speeches which have already been delivered during this debate, have cleared the air considerably. They have dissipated many misapprehensions which have been expressed throughout Canada during the last few months concerning the financial standing of the Canadian Northern Eailway system, apparently intended to justify in the eyes of the people of this country the action this Government intended to take in this matter. But the speeches in this debate have been of greater value to the people and have given us a great deal of the inside history of the Canadian Northern railway. The hon. member for Calgary (Mr. Bennett), in his eloquent and most interesting speech, told us that a great deal more could be told to this House and the country if only the proper means could be taken to achieve this end. For my part, I should like to have the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nAt the outset let me say I absolutely agree with the opinion which has been expressed during this debate that a third transcontinental railway was an ultimate\n\nnecessity for this country, if it was not actually a present and immediate necessity. These words to me are words of hope and confidence in the future of this country. It is a policy which has been adopted, it is a hope which I believe is shared by the vast majority of Canadians. But, Sir, this fact alone does not justify us in acting hastily with regard to the resolutions now submitted to us. To-day this Parliament is called upon once more to come to the assistance of the Canadian Northern railway to the extent of $45,000,000. We have been generous to this railway enterprise in the past. We are told that, by this agreement to-day, we are becoming a partner. Then, I say, Sir, it is our first duty as representatives of the people to see what this new partnership means for the people; for we know just what we are going to pay, but we do not know so fully what we are to receive for our money. I go further and say I believe it is our duty, before even discussing the merits of this resolution, to know the men with whom we are called upon to deal. We have been told in this debate that Messrs. Mackenzie and. Mann have given ample evidence of pluck and courage. That is true, and it cannot be denied; and we may say without fear of contradiction that they have shown special zeal in looking after their own interests. For this we cannot blame them-far from it. But their action during the experiences we in this House have had with them should bring us to the view that we also have interests to protect-the interests of the people of Canada. And if we were to go back and review our dealings with these men and the results of those dealings, they could be summarized in one word; that that word would spell 'deception.' Last year we voted millions to the Canadian Northern, but we voted them upon one condition, because we were told that that money would be sufficient to complete the line. To-day these men are again at the door of Parliament seeking new assistance. Last year we were told that if we voted these millions we would have one-tenth of the stock of the Canadian Northern railway. But we have not one-tenth of the stock of the Canadian Northern railway. And' when to-day the Solicitor General comes forward and tells us that by this new arrangement we are to have a two-fifths proprietorship, I ask, what greater guarantee we have this year than we had last year that these terms will eventually materialize? With these fact.? before us, I\n\nclaim that we should pause and we should investigate. Let us know upon what grounds we were deceived last year; we may then be able to prevent a repetition of such actions. Sir, there is no need to hurry this proposal through. Thebe is no financial crisis before us such as has been so vividly portrayed to us by the Tory press of Canada. The Canadian Northern railway can meet their liabilities- Messrs. Mackenzie and Mann tell us so. And these resolutions tell us so, for they stipulate that not a dollar of this $45,000,000 shall go to meet the liabilities of this company. Therefore we can pause and we can investigate, and that is our duty under the present circumstances.\n\nOne word about the security we are to receive for this money. In the first place, we are told that we are to have a mortgage on the stock of the subsidiary companies; but we are told that ten of these companies are already mortgaged for $18,000,000. We are told that we are to get a floating mortgage on the property of the Canadian Northern railway. But we see that that property is also mortgaged to the extent of $312,000,000. Then, we are also to have a mortgage on the property of subsidiary companies, but this is limited and will not cover the whole amount of the $45,000,000 we are asked to vote, but every one of these subsidiary companies will have the right to give a mortgage only for that part of the $45,000,000 which is to be expended in the territory in which it operates. And lastly we are to have forty per cent of the common stock of the Canadian Northern railway. As has been said, though we are giving the bulk of the money, we are getting a junior partnership and will have no control. To me this is not satisfactory. The Solicitor General (Mr. Meighen), tells us this is the best security we could have. The hon. member for St. Antoine (Mr. Ames) tells us that it is a splendid bargain. ,But, immediately after, the hon. member for Calgary (Mr. Bennett), rises, and after a four hour speech giving the history of the Canadian Northern railway, he warns us: Do not act hastily, for the basis of these resolutions is deception, and deception again. I say it is our duty to look into these matters; and these contradictions iwe have heard from the other side of the House afford us much stronger reasons for investigating this matter before proceeding any farther.\n\nWhat has been the result as it has developed from the discussion which we have heard? What will be the position of\n\nCanada? We are told, and it is the only conclusion which we may draw from the arguments which we have heard in this House during this debate, that if we ado.pt these resolutions, if this measure goes through, Canada will be 'fourth mortgage behind an enterprise which is1 already soaked with watered securities and watered stock. For my part I cannot accept these proposals and I intend to vote against them.\n\nThere are many other points upon which I would have liked to have touched, which only go to strengthen my conviction that the Government have not safeguarded sufficiently the interests of the people of Canada. If we give assistance that assistance should be coupled with an assurance that the money which we are voting will be used to pay the debts, to complete the line so that these gentlemen will never have to again return to this House for further assistance. I do not believe that that assurance is guaranteed to us in the resolution. Finally, and this is my last grievance, I fail to see why the Government did not exact from the Canadian Northern railway what the Parliament of 1884 exacted from the Canadian Pacific railway under circumstances similar to those of to-day. These promoters-, if they wish to impress faith and confidence in their enterprise upon us sitting here as representatives of the people, should first pledge their personal wealth to the final success of their own work and undertaking."}, {"url": "https://www.lipad.ca/members/record/68071fca-03f2-4f7c-b33c-2ed63bb08327/4/", "page_content": "Mr. PACAUD:\n\nF. A. Acland, Deputy\n\nMinister of Labour. I have a, letter dated the 30th June and addressed to Mr. Rousseau which is of secondary importance. It informs Mr. Rousseau that:\n\nMr. Narcisse Arcand, one of the officers of this department, has been charged to go to Thetford Mines and to give you all the assistance to settle amicably the differences arising between the employers and the employees.\n\nBefore I go any further I hope the minister will he in a position to tell us exactly what was the work that was performed by Mr. Arcand at Thetford. He was sent there by the department, but I notice in the documents brought down by the minister there is no mention of him at all. I know he was aronnd there for a week or so, and I understand he was dismissed from the service. I do not know if it was in connection with that strike or not. Negotiations ^fent on between the 30th June, the time of the arrival of Mr. Arcand, and the 15t'h July. Then a petition was sent to the department. This petition requested a board of conciliation. I notice that in this petition there are three special points. First, it was declared that the cause of the dispute was that the present wages were not in proportion to the high cost of living. The petition is in French, and it says:-\n\nThe cause and the nature of the difference is that the present wages are not in proportion to the high cost of living.\n\nIn the second place, they note that 90 per cent of the men had voted in favour of a strike, but that the officers had decided to ask for a report. In the third place, it was stated that direct negotiations were impossible in view of the fact that the employers had stated that no concessions would he made. I wish to direct attention to this point in the petition that Mr. Sharpe, manager of the Asbestos Corporation of Canada, had declared to the men that he had absolutely no concessions to make. Therefore, to return to the letter of the 29th June from the department, i't was stated that if negotiations failed the men would only 'have to apply for a board and it would be granted. That letter was in reply to the letter of the 27th, which made reference to the possibility of a strike, and, therefore, the letter of the 29th could only have that one meaning. Therefore, on the 15th July, when the\n\npetition was sent to the department, the minister knew that direct negotiations were at an end, because, in order to have direct negotiations, there must be two parties. One of the parties having said that he was not going to make any concessions whatever, the men had an absolute reply to the letter of the 29th of June, and they sent forward their petition. That was on the 15th July. On the 24th July the department sent the following letter to Mr. Rousseau:-\n\nDepartment of Labour,\n\nCanada.\n\nOttawa, 24th July, 1916.\n\nRe-law of enquiries in matters of industrial disputes of 1907, concerning the differences between the proprietor of the Asbestos Mines at Thetford Mines, Quebec, and their employees, members of the local Union, No. 143 of the Western Federation of Miners.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge reception of a petition signed by Mr. Joseph VallCe, and by yourself, as President and Secretary of the local Union 143 of the Western Federation of Miners, requesting the establishment by the miners of a commission of conciliation and enquiry by virtue of the law of enquiries in matters of industrial disputes, 1907. The petition does not mention clearly that yourself and Mr. Vallfie had informed the employees of the information given out at the time of your conference in the office of the Minister about one or two weeks ago, with the representatives of the principal Asbestos companies.\n\nThe questions which the petition claims are in dispute comprise the recognition of the Union, the check of system, etc. The opinion of the Minister is that these questions cannot be properly submitted to a commission of conciliation to be settled, and that it seems understood that the question of the recognition was not to be regarded as vital and was given up. As for the claim for a raise of wages, the conversation held in the office of the Minister established, you will remember, that a raise of salary having been given during the month of April last, and that the representatives of the company and of the employees at that meeting seemed to have come then at the conclusion that no advantage would probably result from a new agitation of this question at the present time.\n\nThe opinion of the Minister is, in the first place, that the employees of each company should be informed by Mr. VallSe or by yourself of the general nature and of the results of this discussion in question ; and, in the second place, that the pending questions should be discussed with each company separately, through the medium of a committee of employees, and you will remember that the Minister obtained for the Secretary of the Union the privilege of accompanying the committee of employees and to plead their cause. In proceeding along these principles, the employees will act in accordance with the entente which have been arrived at in the office of the Minister.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) F. A. ACLAND, Deputy-Minister of Labour, and Clerk of the Commission of Conciliation and Enquiry. Mr. L. J. L. Rousseau,\n\nThetford Mines, Que.\n\nI think that before going -any further it would be well to summarize the position taken by the minister. On the 27th of June, he received a letter from the men informing him that the situation at Thetford is serious, that on the 1st of July they intended to take a vote as to whether or not they would go on strike. On the 29th, the minister writes acknowledging the receipt of this letter and telling the men: We aTe pleased that you are trying to negotiate; continue your negotiations and if you are not successful ask for a Board of Conciliation. In the petition of the 15th of July it was cleariy established and proved that direct negotiations were impossible, and the petitioners requested, not a favour, but the application of the law. The minister acknowledges the receipt of the petition on the 24th of July and then he says: But there is no more ground for a Board of conciliation; you, Mr. Vallee or Mr. Rousseau, go and see individually every miner, 2,000 of them; and after you have seen them individually and told them what happened in my office in April, that is six months before, go and see every employer and tell him what happened in our office at that time.' All of this was in the letter of the 24th of July, although we do not find it in the letter of the 29th of June. This letter was answered by Mr. Rousseau in the name of the union:\n\nThetford Mines, 28th July, 1916. The Clerk of the Commission of Conciliation and Enquiry,\n\nSir:-\n\nIn answer to your letter dated the 24th of July I wish to tell you that we do not see why our petition requesting a commission of 'conciliation and enquiry should contain clearly that we had previously informed our members of the information gathered at our conference at Ottawa, so that it would be accepted. As a matter of fact, we had informed our members of all the details of our interview with you. We take the permission of calling your attention on the fact that the points in dispute are: raising of salary from $2.00 to $2.50, that is to say approximately 25 per cent on the salaries as they are to-day.\n\nDuring April last, it is true that there was a raise of 25 cents as an average, but taking into consideration the rising cost of living which is constant, our members have decided to claim this new raise of wages of 50 cents per day which is most reasonable and below the salaries paid in other parts of Canada.\n\nWe must consider further that our members do not work when the weather is bad, which is not the exception in our locality. You tell us in. your letter that the opinion of the Minister is that the miners of each company should submit and discuss with each manager separately the questions in dispute. We differ totally with you. His opinion would perhaps be good, if we were not organized as a labour union, but as such is the case, the moment that\n\nour union by a vote taken at a meeting especially called to discuss such a demand, that decision becomes collective and applies to all the companies indiscriminately where our members are employed. If the opinion of the Minister was followed in the present case, we would have to follow it in cases where a trade union is engaged in about 500 different industries, which would be an impossibility and proves that that opinion is not conformable neither to the spirit nor to the letter of the law on industrial disputes. Nevertheless, we have fulfilled his desire through protesting on the interpretation given by the minister, and here is the result of our interviews. Mr. Hammerick, of the Jacob Asbestos, refused to grant the wish of the Minister in allowing me to accompany the delegation of miners from his mines. His answer was that his company could probably pay the salary that was requested but he did not know what to do under the circumstances. Mr. Johnson was amiable enough to meet the desire of the miners and he said in substance: that the raise of wages was favorable and agreeable to him, but that it would be necessary to come to an understanding with the other miners. Hon. J. It. Smith refused to recognize the advice of the Minister. We tried to meet Messrs Sharp & Bennett, but we were unable to do so due to their numerous occupations, v A great many people are enticing our men to strike. The detectives are daily repeating to our men: Hold on, you will win out. We cannot keep our men any longer. We have had to-night a general meeting and it was unanimously resolved that the workmen considered that they should not wait any longer for a Board of Arbitration. If in the 2nd of August it is not granted, we will take a decision. We therefore renew our request for a Board of Arbitration and attract the attention on the fact that it is impossible for us to prevent our members any longer to go on strike if this Board is not nominated in the very near future, and we disclaim any responsibility for the situation which might arise as we have given evidence of patiotism in preventing up to this date a strike at the mine at Thetford Mines and that we have conformed ourselves to the laws which govern this country in making application for a Board of Arbitration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) L. J. L. Rousseau,\n\nSecretary, W.F.M.\n\nThen we have Mr. Rousseau on the 29th of July again sending a telegram to the clerk of the council of conciliation and inquiry:\n\nThetford Mines, 29th July, 1916.\n\nTo the Clerk of the Council of Conciliation and Enquiry, Department of Labor, Ottawa, Ont.,-\n\nOur interview with the miners of the mines has not had the success which was expected. At a meeting held the same night, we have passed a resolution to inform you that if a Board of Arbitration is not granted on the 2nd of August, we shall no longer wait. I am writing you the details.\n\n(Signed) L. J. L. Rousseau.\n\nThe only reply that the men got to that latter was this, on the 31st July, 1916, from the Assistant Deputy Minister of Labour:\n\nOttawa, 31st July, 1916. Deputy Minister of Labour,\n\nCanada.\n\nSir,-I have the honor to acknowledge reception of your telegram concerning the actual differences between the employers and several of their employees at the asbestos mines of the district of Thetford Mines. We are taking measures which we hope will obviate the necessity of establishing a commission of conciliation and enquiry.\n\nAnything but a Board of Conciliation.\n\nIn any case this department will not fail to make the greatest efforts in its power in the interest of peace and to assure the rights of the respective parties. We are. waiting for the reception of the details promised in your telegram.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) Gerald H. Brown, Assistant Deputy Minister of Labor. Mr. L. J. L. Rousseau,\n\nThetford Mines.\n\nNow we come to the culmination. The men had waited in vain. They informed the department officially on the 20th of June of their intention to take action, but the 3rd of August, 1916, arrived and nothing had been done. Then the minister received this telegram:\n\nA general strike has been declared this morning at 7.30. The men are nearly all out of work.\n\nL. J. L. Rousseau.\n\nAnd I see on the 3rd of August a telegram to J. L. Rousseau:\n\nMr. Blanchet will be in Thetford Mines tomorrow to make public investigation. Have men continue work meantime.\n\n(Sgd.) T. W. Crothers.\n\nBut the strike had already been declared. Mr. Blanchet came to Thetford. There was a very large meeting at St. Maurice, one of the sections of the town. The people had been informed that the department would send a man, but it was a great disappointment to them as everybody spoke but Mr. Blanchet, so that we did not know what mission he had. After the strike had been on for one week, on the 10th of August, 1916, the men had a letter from the minister as follows:\n\nOttawa, 10th of August, 1917. Dear Mr. Rousseau,-\n\nI was very much grieved to learn that the miners of Thetford Mines had left their work a few days ago, a fact which I cannot help but think was not at all wise, especially at a time when negotiations were going on in view of a settlement by agreement.\n\nAnd this is after all the correspondence I have placed on Hansard to-night.\n\n\"When the war broke out, I addressed to the employers and to the employees a special de-\n\nmancl to evade everywhere where it would be possible all labour difficulties, and I am happy to know that that line of conduct was generally followed by the two parties.\n\nIt is of the greatest importance for the workmeh that all their efforts which tend to better their condition should be such as to attract the sympathy of the public in general, for if they have not the public opinion behind them, these efforts would not be crowned with any permanent success, and especially during the war, public opinion is decidedly opposed to any cessation of work. The product of the mines at Thetford is of urgent necessity for the pursuance of the war and it is, I believe, the duty of the employees to return immediately to their work, and if it is necessary they could continue negotiations in view of bettering their condition.\n\nI hope that you will be able to use your influence to bring about a just and reasonable settlement of the present difficulty and at all events to persuade the employees to return to work. I understand that the operators are ready to raise the wages by 25 cents per day, and I believe that if this is true it would be to the better interest of the employees to accept this offer. I fervently desire that the employees should everywhere receive fair treatment, but at the same time I am strongly of the opinion that under the circumstances the workmen of the mines at Thetford should accept this offer and return immediately to work.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain,\n\nTours truly\n\nMr. J. 1,. J. Rousseau,\n\nThetford Mines, P.Q.\n\nThe letter was not signed, but I presume it was from the minister. It is addressed to Mr. L. J. L. Rousseau, Thetford Mines, Quebec.\n\nThe most important fact brought out by this letter is that the minister did not consider that the strike was a serious matter. He recognizes the importance of the operation of the mines, in view of the war, but he does nothing to prevent the strike. He goes back on what he said in his previous letter. He is notified on July 30 by telegram and letter that on August 2 there would be a strike unless the law were applied. Although he recognizes it as urgent in view of the war that the strike should be prevented, this is the course he took: he passed an Order in Council dated August 3, sending Mr. Blanchet to Thetford to prevent the strike-after the strike had been declared.\n\nBut the miners of Thetford Mines were not to be denied consideration. They took to heart the little reproach of the minister and they sent him the following reply:\n\nTo the Honourable T. W. Crothers,\n\nMinister of Labour,\n\nParliament Buildings, Ottawa. Mr. the Minister;\n\nWe have at hand your letter of the 10th\n\ninstant. In reply I wish to inform you that\n\nwe have already acted in line with your wishes and that from the 10th of August last, the date on which you wrote us, the labour union of which I am the secretary had already given its assent to a resolution passed by a group of citizens of Thetford Mines, accepted at a meeting in which merchants and business men who are not workmen at the mines, but who have at heart the immediate settlement of these differences. You will see in reading a copy of this resolution, which accompanies my letter, that there is nothing excessively hard nor severe for the employers. It does not seem though that the latter have manifested any desire to accept it. The men belonging to the local catholic union have not as yet replied to the committee of citizens that they were ready to accept. We will add that as you informed us that the product of our men is of urgent necessity for the pursuance of the war, and that it was a patriotic duty for us to make certain sacrifices so as not to diminish this production. The union of which I am the secretary is right to accept an agreement still less severe for the employers and which ia as follows:\n\n1. The salary of all the workmen will be of $0.25 per day higher than it was at the month of July last.\n\n2. This scale of wages would remain in force during one year.\n\nI have here a letter from Mr. Deschamps, attorney-at-law of Thetford Mines, who was secretary of the meeting of citizens at Thetford Mines which had been convened by the mayor. The letter is as follows:\n\nThetford Mines,\n\nAugust 10th, 1916.\n\nMr. Joseph Vallfie,\n\nPresident International Miners, P.Q.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt a meeting at Thetford Mines specially convened by His Honour the Mayor and held at the City Hall this day at 3.30 p.m., it was resolved unanimously to submit to the proprietors of the mines and also to the Labour Union a project of settlement which was submitted by His Honour the Mayor, of which a copy is herewith enclosed.\n\nYou will oblige me by giving me as soon as possible a reply informing me if your union accepts this project, so that I may be able to submit your reply at the next meeting.\n\nI do not feel .that it is necessary to read this agreement. It is in absolute conformity with the terms of the letter written by the minister on August 10. The men had agreed to receive 25 cents a day.\n\nI have given all the facts in this matter. The minister had one of two courses to follow: to respect the law or to evade it. He preferred to follow the latter course and to refuse a board of arbitration requested by the men, the law being very clear on this point. As a result of this refusal on his part for reasons which I do not wish to unveil, this body of men received more unfair treatment-I myself was a witness of what happened-than was ever accorded\n\nto anybody in this country at the hands of a minister of the Crown."}, {"url": "https://everything.explained.today/%5C/Lucien_Turcotte_Pacaud/", "page_content": "Lucien Turcotte Pacaud Explained\n\nLucien Turcotte Pacaud (September 21, 1879 - March 5, 1960) was a Canadian lawyer and political figure.

T. PACAUD (Megantic):\n\nMr. Speaker, the debate, through the speeches which have already been made, has rohbed me of arguments which I intended to offer the House, and I shall therefore willingly curtail my remarks somewhat.\n\nThe question of the food supply which is raised by this motion involves considerations which are of the utmost importance both to our country and to our Allies. No other question, Sir, has stirred and aroused the people of Canada more fervently, moire deeply or more unanimously. This intense feeling which has been growing and spreading steadily since the outbreak of war may easily be explained by an impartial survey of conditions as they have existed and still exist in Canada at this time. On the one hand we have the prohibitive prices, which deny to the masses the very necessaries of life, with the accompanying hardships and misery. On the other hand we have the revolting disclosures that have been made from time to time concerning the hoarding of food, the cold storage opera-1SJ\n\ntions, the nefarious greed of the profiteers. These, Sir, are the outstanding facts which cannot he denied. Mr. O'Connor has exposed them to the public. We had the story of the bacon manipulations; we had the egg disclosures; and more recently, and through another source, we heard of hundreds and hundreds of pounds of chicken left to rot in cold storage at Winnipeg. I hese may serve as illustrations of what i3 going on in Canada on a very large scale. Sir, in the face of such disclosures, nothing effective was done or attempted to be done by the Government to remedy snch an evil. Are we not tempted, Sir, to laud the patience of the Canadian people in the face of euch provocation from the men who daily exploit them', from the Government who refuses to protect them?\n\nWhat has the Government done? A Food Board was created and a Food Controller was put in control. The Order in Council creating this board gave the Controller clearly defined powers. He had the right \" to govern the prices of any article of food and to supervise the storage, .the distribution, the sale and the delivery of these articles.\" Why were not these powers exercised, exercised especially in the cases which have been brought to the attention of the public by the High Cost of Living Commissioner?\n\nInstead of taking immediate steps to curtail this open exploitation of the public, the Government, through its commissioner, preferred to follow the easier course of preaching economy to the people. Under the circumstances which I have related, I say that these mere words, followed by no effective action, may have satisfied the cold storage magnates, but they certainly have not satisfied the people of this country.\n\nWe have in Canada an abundance of food, sufficient not only for our own needs, but the greater bulk of which is exported to allied countries. This brings me to another phase of this same question-the campaign of production which the Government has so fervently prosecuted of late. To this campaign all loyal Canadians will give their hearty support. We all recognize that upon the success of our devotion to food raising depends in a large measure the victory of our hoys at the front. We -know that the world faces to-day a food situation which is nothing short of appalling. We know that the supply is not sufficient to feed the world's armies, let alone the civilian population. But, Sir, this is not all. We have had occasion ^ to hear the representatives of. Britain making to us an appeal,-\n\nan appeal which will surely be heard and responded to, and which has thrilled each one of us in a patriotic determination to strive every nerve to do what is requested of us. Lord Rhondda, the British food controller, for one, has made his plea quite clear. \"We look,\" he says, \"to the resources of Canada and the indomitable energy of Canadians for an answer that will shatter Germany's threat of starvation.\" He tells us, that it is vital for the United Kingdom and the Allies to obtain from Canada foodstuffs in far larger quantities than under peace conditions. His frankness even goes so far as to recall to us that an increased export of food supplies must be forthcoming, even though the achievement of this task entails diversion of,effort from other enterprises. It is Canada's duty to prove her efficiency and her determination. This plea must not be left unanswered. May I be permitted to confess that these words of the British food controller are comforting to those of us who through motives which cannot be challenged, opposed a measure which wre sincerely believed if put into operation would decidedly diminish if not defeat our effectiveness in this war, by laying aside the most formidable weapon which could have been used against the enemy. We faced a storm of abuse and slander, but these attacks did not deter us from what we believed was our plain duty. We have at least the consolation of knowing that our conception of duty was shared, in some measure at least, by the brightest minds of Britain. What we need to-day, is a larger acreage and higher yields for the years to come. We need to increase our productive capacity, the problem is with us, and it must be solved. Upon its solution, to my mind, depends the success of our allies and ourselves in this war. To achieve our purpose, it is obvious that we need farm labour. It is not less obvious that it is a national necessity that we should remove the duties on farming implements. The Government have started in their task by means of the registration of the man power of the Dominion. I believe that, though that is a good step in the right direction, it has come a little late; it should have been done at the very beginning of the war. Nevertheless, I sincerely hope, that in its results it may procure more information and attain better results for Canada and for the Empire than has been achieved by the now famous National Service cards of a year ago.\n\nMr. J. IE. FONTAINE (Hull) (translation) : Mr. Speaker, I am perhaps a little\n\naudacious in rising to take part in this debate, since I have just entered this Parliament, and am in nowise familiar with Parliamentary procedure; nevertheless,\n\nwhen the voters of Hull county, which I have the honour to represent, elected me by acclamation on the 19th of last November,\n\nI gave them my solemn promise that I would seize upon every opportunity offered to protest against the exorbitant cost of living and try to bring it down if it were possible to do so. It was reserved, Mr. Speaker, for the right hon. leader of the Opposition, to afford me this opportunity in bringing about this debate this afternoon; for him who, in contrast to the hon. gentlemen seated on the other side of the House, has always been the protector and the defender of the people against the trusts and the monopolists.\n\nIt is useless, I believe, for me to say that the present cost of living has reached a price so high that the consumer is forced ti deprive himself even of necessaries of life. I could mention things, foods like flour, bacon, eggs, which have surely increased 50 and even 100 per cent. If, at least, Mr. Speaker, salaries had increased in proportion; but I see, by the reports of the Labour Gazette which I have here before me, that salaries have not been increased by more than 15 to 17i per cent. There has been a general protest. I remember, in the city of Hull, where I reside, on the other side of Ottawa, hearing Mr. Watters, the president of the Labour Unions of Canada, denounce the Minister of Labour (Mr.'Crothers) and even denounce the Prime Minister of this country because the workingmen could not procure the necessaries of life with the low salaries they were paid.\n\nIn the face of these protests the Government thought they would calm public opinion by appointing what they called a Food Controller, and it was then that the Government told us of the appointment of Mr. Hanna. Everybody was satisfied, the people believed that the .Government was sincere and that by their appointing a Food Controller we could at least earn enough to enable us to buy the necessaries of life. The irony of it, Mr. Speaker ! The Controller was well and duly appointed; he was given spacious offices, and it is said that his suite was furnished with luxury and that he was given a staff, both very numerous and very expensive-if I believe the gentlemen who have preceded me-and still he was not controlling; the cost of living was soaring all the time.\n\nA moment ago I heard my hon. friend, the Minister of Customs, say that the appoint-\n\nment of the Controller did not aim at control. My iLord! we were well aware of it, he never did control! His duty consisted simply in seeing that no food was wasted. Could he have forgotten what my hon. friend from Meg-antic (Mr. Pacaud) said a while ago? Haven't we learned, in the last few days, through the newspapers, that a large ..quantity of foodstuffs, hoarded in storage warehouses in order to boost prices, had been sent to the incinerator in the city of Winnipeg? Well! if the duty of the Food Controller was to prevent the waste of foodstuffs, why did he allow such .an enormous quantity of food to find its way to the garbage heap? Is it because those implicated are the friends of the Government? I ask you that, Mr. Speaker."}, {"url": "https://wikizero.com/www//Lucien_Turcotte_Pacaud", "page_content": "Canadian politician\n\nLucien Turcotte Pacaud (September 21, 1879 \u2013 March 5, 1960) was a Canadian lawyer and political figure.

I am very much pleased that the minister has mentioned the matter.

Immediately before I attended the meeting, which was the only one I addressed, I went and saw the manager of the mine and asked if the men had been sent at the request of that company, and I asked the department and they said they were short of labour.
