BOTTOM: Henry Bibby, Terry Schofield, Andy Hill.\n\nJohn Vallely Today\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Vallely, age 53, was raised in Orange County and now lives in Newport Beach. During his college days, John was a member of the UCLA Bruins basketball team and participated in two National Championship seasons, 1969 and 1970, under legendary coach John Wooden. John and wife Karen met during college and were married in 1970, the year John graduated with a degree in sociology. The couple had two children: a son, Eric, and a daughter, Erin. When Erin was 9 years old she was diagnosed with cancer, and eventually lost her battle, at the age of 12, in 1991. Since then, John and Karen have been committed to fighting pediatric cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, John is completing treatment for his own illness, lymphoma, and is very optimistic about his recovery. John says he uses Wooden\u2019s Pyramid of Success strategy to deal with his cancer. Wooden\u2019s philosophy, according to Vallely, focuses on success rather than winning. \u201cI have no conflict in my heart about knowing that I am the best I can be and so I have peace of mind,\u201d John says. \u201cSuccess is the absence of conflict. Actually it\u2019s harder to do than winning. It\u2019s possible to win a game without doing your best. But knowing have been the best husband, the best father, the best patient I can, is all I can do.\u201d\n\nSurviving With Strength\n\nA Former UCLA Basketball Star Writes About Dealing with the Loss of a Daughter from Cancer, and Then, Fighting His Own Battle with Lymphoma\n\nBy John Vallely\n\n\n\nA random attack of cancer strikes fear in anyone. Why me? Am I going to die? What did I do wrong? Why did this have to strike my daughter at such a young age? It\u2019s not possible to answer these questions. What matters most, is our response to these life challenges.\n\n\n\nMy experience with cancer began in 1988. My 9- year-old daughter Erin was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. Surgeons removed a cantaloupe- sized tumor from her abdomen, but were unable to get the entire growth. Until her death in 1991, she endured multiple s u r g e r i e s , chemotherapy and radiation that severely burned her already ill body. I learned so much from her. I miss her.\n\n\n\nIn April 2002, at 53 years old, I was diagnosed with lymphoma. I cannot tell you how astonished I was to learn of my condition. How could this be? Haven't we had enough? My wife and I had already experienced our child dying in our arms. What could be next for us? What about our son Eric? Again I was filled with fear, but once we all began to fight back it gradually subsided.\n\n\n\nThe first step of each patient\u2019s process is correct diagnosis. I believe you must have at least two opinions regarding pathology. If a patient is incorrectly diagnosed, the treatment will not attack their disease. I have spoken with patients who were disappointed with treatment outcome. They later learned that the course of medications would have been different had they researched their circumstances more thoroughly. Consensus on diagnosis is good. Differing opinions lead to better decisions, so patient and family must be proactive and explore options. The relationship with the medical system should be considered a partnership.\n\n\n\nThe next step is launching a plan of attack. After all, this is War! Most things, including my cancer, are not simply about winning and losing. My disease is about the process. I believe it is important to have a positive attitude. Mine is: \"I will be the best I can be. I will do all that I can do to get well and to help my loved ones. I will follow all of the doctor\u2019s directions. I will do everything in my power to give myself and loved ones every chance to survive this disease. And then I will pray!\"\n\n\n\nI believe \"hope\" is important. One can benefit from faith in something. The mental, physical and spiritual obstacles related to cancer are severe. A positive outlook may not have the power to heal -\u2014 but, then again, it might. I believe, at the very least, it can make the process more manageable. Hope and faith are very personal. I was broken-hearted and disappointed when God did not heal my daughter. Yet, I believe she is in heaven. When I was diagnosed, I was angry with God. My lonely walks on the beach brought on another series of questions: What kind of God are you? Do you care? What do you want with my family? Even so, I never gave up my trust that God is watching over Erin.\n\n\n\nMy journey forward has been steady but difficult. It requires a willingness to participate on so many levels and I\u2019m always seeking answers. I believe that the process will lead to living my life at the highest level, regardless of the outcome. Prayer and reflection are part of my daily vigilance. I am grateful that doctors, nurses, chemotherapy, and other drugs are available. I consider these to be gifts from God. I also believe this is part of a grand plan that will give me, the cancer patient, an opportunity to fight and a chance to get well.\n\n\n\nWhen our daughter Erin died my wife, Karen, and I made our decision to fight back. We joined with others in an organization called the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation (PCRF) to raise funds for research aimed at curing pediatric cancer. I\u2019m a past president of PCRF, and currently a member of the PCRF board of directors. Karen spends countless hours on the PCRF Holiday Card Program \u2014 their major fund raising activity for the last 20 years. Our family shares the goals of PCRF.\n\n\n\nRaising funds to support research will help fight this terrible disease. Over the last 20 years the survival rate for children with cancer has more than doubled because of research. Regardless of the outcome of my disease, I know that we are making a difference in this big battle, that we are committed until cancer is defeated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Links John Vallely Motivates\n\nLatest News Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.landofbasketball.com/nba_players_stats/john_vallely.htm", "page_content": "403 Error - Forbidden\n\nFor some reason this resource can't be accessed.\n\n(If your browser version is too old it might have been blocked for security reasons.

The list of great players who made their marks in both sports is long: Mike Dodd, Mike Whitmarsh, Greg Lee, and, of course, the legendary Wilt Chamberlain. But John Vallely may be the greatest two-sport athlete of them all.\n\nOn the hardwood, Vallely was an all-CIF performer at Corona Del Mar high school and a two-time NCAA Champion at UCLA, making the all-tournament team both times. He was named an All-American in 1970 and was drafted in the first round of the NBA where he played for the Atlanta Hawks.\n\nAs impressive as Vallely was in hoops, he was equally dominant in the sand game. Introduced to beach volleyball while in high school, when he was only 19 years old the legendary Ron Von Hagen asked Vallely to team up. The two would form one of the game\u2019s most intimidating duos. In 1969, Vallely and Von Hagen put together a perfect season, winning all of the five open tournaments they entered, including the Manhattan Open where they beat Henry Bergman and Larry Rundle in the finals. Vallely would go on to win three more tournaments with Von Hagen as well as the 1970 Santa Cruz Open with Brian Lewis, Sr. the father of Hall of Famer Brian Lewis.\n\nVallely was an explosive player with great hops, but he complemented his athleticism with impeccable ball control. He was one of the best passers and setters of his era, and when combined with Von Hagen\u2019s similar talents, Vallely would wear other teams down by siding out flawlessly time and time again.\n\nHis basketball commitments limited his time on the beach. There is little doubt that if he had been dedicated full-time to the beach the record books would look very different today.\n\nFollowing his basketball career, Vallely built a successful real estate portfolio and a sports apparel business. Since the passing of his daughter from cancer at the age of 12, he has been actively involved in pediatric cancer research, serving on the Board of Director of the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation.\n\nVallely faced his own battle with cancer, being diagnosed with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma in 2002. After a successful stem cell/bone marrow transplant in 2006, Vallely lives and works in Orange County, married to his wife Karen of almost 50 years and close to his son Eric and granddaughter Erin.\n\nJohn Vallely.

But if the Lakers could win \u2014 something they had done 20 consecutive times before \u2014 they\u2019d celebrate on the court with a ceremony and in the locker room with champagne.\n\n1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers team photo at the Forum\n\n(Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nOn Sunday, Dec. 12, 1971, the Lakers won their 21st consecutive game, setting the record for the longest winning streak in NBA history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure glad it\u2019s over,\u201d Wilt Chamberlain said that night.\n\nYet the Lakers\u2019 winning streak wasn\u2019t close to ending. And the record they set \u2014 the longest winning streak in team sports \u2014 is still standing 50 years later.\n\nThe Lakers would win 33 straight games, an unfathomable achievement that spanned the course of 65 days during the team\u2019s magical championship season, the franchise\u2019s first after relocating from Minneapolis in 1960.\n\nLakers guard Jerry West (14) is fouled by Rockets guard John Vallely after driving around a screen by center Wilt Chamberlain on Dec. 27, 1971. (Associated Press)\n\nThe Lakers scored 4,069 points during the streak, beating their opponents by an average of 16 points per game. Only one team, the Phoenix Suns, took them to overtime. And 24 times, opponents couldn\u2019t keep the margin inside 10 points.\n\nChamberlain, Jerry West, Gail Goodrich, Pat Riley and Bill Sharman \u2014 the names on their own are legendary. But as part of the 1971-72 Lakers, they combined to create an accomplishment that\u2019s still standing strong thanks to a combination of excellence, talent, time and place.\n\n\u201cIf that 33-game winning streak at the time happened today with all the social media and coverage,\u201d Riley, a backup guard on the team, told The Times, \u201cit would be probably be almost unbearable to do.\u201d\n\nRiley should know. The Miami Heat team he helped assemble, with LeBron James and Chris Bosh joining Dwyane Wade, ripped off 27 consecutive wins in 2013. The Golden State Warriors pushed up against the fringes of the Lakers\u2019 streak, winning 28 in a row over two regular seasons in 2015.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been close to being threatened since then.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest. I don\u2019t want to see it broken \u2014 at least during my lifetime,\u201d said Jim Cleamons, a rookie on the Lakers\u2019 1971-72 team. \u201cIt\u2019s like Joe DiMaggio. I don\u2019t think anybody is going to beat his 56-game hitting streak, so I don\u2019t want anybody to beat our 33-game winning streak. I\u2019ll be honest about that. I don\u2019t want to see it broken.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just sorry it wasn\u2019t a little bit higher. I would have like to have really put it out there.\u201d\n\nAll winning streaks before it and after it have started the same way \u2014 following a loss. But only the greatest streak in professional team sports could start with a loss like this.\n\nElgin Baylor wasn\u2019t just a Laker at the time \u2014 he was the Lakers. He followed the team to Los Angeles from Minneapolis, bringing with him an electrifying style of play that would be mimicked by the NBA\u2019s most exciting players for generations to come.\n\nLakers coach Bill Sharman yells instruction from the bench during the 1971-72 season. (Art Rogers / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThat version of Baylor was gone, an Achilles injury and achy knees slowing the Lakers\u2019 most dynamic player to a crawl. Sharman, the Lakers\u2019 new coach, wanted to make a change and move the 37-year-old Baylor out of the starting lineup.\n\nBaylor, having played in only nine games before the winning streak began, instead retired. He made the decision after the Lakers lost to the Golden State Warriors by four points on Oct. 31, 1971.\n\n\u201cHe was not getting the kind of results that he expected of himself,\u201d Goodrich said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re that good \u2014 boy, he was that good \u2014 and you start to see your skills diminished a little bit. \u2026 And while you can still make a contribution, I think that, you know, his benchmark was so high for himself.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to fathom, especially for West.\n\n\u201cMy buddy, my friend, my cohort for so many years, I just sat there and said to myself, \u2018How the hell is this going to be without him in the locker room?\u2019 \u201d West remembered wondering. \u201cIt just was a shock for me. I had no clue, absolutely no clue that he was going to retire. None. I said, \u2018What?\u2019 when I heard about it. \u2026 How did this happen? Why?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it was so shocking for him not to be there. But as I say, they don\u2019t cancel school when a teacher leaves. So, they\u2019re certainly not cancelling a basketball season, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\nFor Sharman, it wasn\u2019t the first time the team\u2019s coach was in the midst of a challenge. Before he lost Baylor, he needed to first convince West to shoot less and distribute the ball more. Admittedly, that sell was easier than the other one he needed to make.\n\nHe needed to convince Chamberlain to wake up early.\n\nSharman was the inventor of the \u201cshootaround\u201d \u2014 a morning practice on game days designed to increase players muscle memory and focus before competition. It also meant an extra trip to the arena, with Chamberlain firing back that Sharman would see him at the Forum once per day \u2014 either for practice or the game.\n\nLike the best jokes, it was full of truth.\n\nBut Sharman had Chamberlain\u2019s respect from his time as Bob Cousy\u2019s backcourt partner during the Boston Celtics\u2019 dynasty. Sharman believed in work ethic, a tone he set during the team\u2019s training camp in Hawaii.\n\nAfter a lunch with Chamberlain, he got the Lakers center on board.\n\nLike West, he also convinced Chamberlain \u2014 owner of another iconic record, his 100-point game \u2014 to sacrifice on offense to anchor the Lakers\u2019 defense and rebounding, while playing quarterback for Sharman\u2019s fast-break offense.\n\nAfter Baylor\u2019s retirement, Sharman turned to West and Chamberlain to be the team\u2019s co-captains. West felt he\u2019d play better without the responsibility, so Chamberlain took on the task alone, he wrote in his autobiography, \u201cWilt: Just like any other 7-foot black millionaire who lives next door.\u201d\n\nWith Chamberlain as the captain and young Jim McMillian replacing Baylor in the starting lineup, the Lakers eased into their new reality with a tight win at home against the Baltimore Bullets.\n\n\u201cMcMillian stepped in. He fit right in \u2014 a good quality scorer, a very, very good defensive player,\u201d Goodrich said. \u201cAnd so, at that point, you know, there was there was no drop off. And we were off.\u201d\n\nLakers Complete coverage: The Lakers\u2019 33-game winning streak 50th anniversary For 65 days and 33 games, the Los Angeles Lakers were unbeatable during the 1971-72 season. Here\u2019s a look back at the winning streak 50 years later.\n\nThey wouldn\u2019t lose again for more than two months.\n\nLegendary Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn narrated a record with highlights of the team\u2019s 33 wins, praising the Lakers for catching their rhythm with a 40-point win in Philadelphia for their fifth consecutive victory.\n\n\u201cOne of the best games in the history of the Lakers,\u201d Hearn exclaimed that night.\n\nIf there were questions about Chamberlain\u2019s buy-in to Sharman\u2019s plan, he answered them against the Boston Celtics, managing to dominate despite scoring only three points in two shots and one trip to the free-throw line.\n\nChamberlain finished that win \u2014 the Lakers\u2019 eighth in a row \u2014 with 31 rebounds, 10 assists and, according to Hearn, 13 blocked shots for one of the strangest triple-doubles in NBA history.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty to watch, I\u2019ll say that. It was pretty to watch,\u201d West remembered. \u201cEveryone shared in different ways. And I\u2019ll never forget that before the season started, Bill Sharman asked me, he said, \u2018I want you to lead the league in assists.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019ll try, if I can.\u2019\n\n\u201cAfter my knee injury, I wasn\u2019t the same player at all. I think I averaged almost 26 points a game even that way. But these games were easy because you just didn\u2019t feel the pressure to score all the time and it got easier for us. Everyone had a role and they performed it.\u201d\n\nWest and Chamberlain were the veterans. Goodrich was the scorer. McMillian provided the two-way support. Happy Hairston was a rebounding machine. Flynn Robinson, the team\u2019s sixth man, could really shoot, and Riley was equally fearless and ferocious. John Trapp and Leroy Ellis reveled in the dirty work.\n\nThe Lakers kept piling up wins, even more impressively considering of how differently the NBA was scheduled in 1971-72. The winning streak began with victories on three straight nights. The first five games of the 33 were played in six days. The first eight wins? That happened in 10 days. Add in commercial travel the morning following games, and the physical demands were incredible.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a pretty incredible stat that the a lot of people don\u2019t realize,\u201d Goodrich said.\n\nThey fell into routines, Goodrich leaving the court after the same made shot before every game and West playing in the same sneakers throughout the run.\n\nBy the time the Lakers hosted the Atlanta Hawks on Dec. 12, people certainly realized the stakes. A win would break the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019 record of 20 straight wins during their championship run the season before, immortalizing Sharman\u2019s team. The fans counted down the final seconds before the 21st win in the streak.\n\nLakers guard Gail Goodrich (25) and center Wilt Chamberlain (13) defeated guard Dave Wohl and the 76ers during their 33-game winning streak. (Associated Press)\n\nThe postgame locker room was a wild scene, Hearn and partner Lynn Shackleford interviewing players while they celebrated.\n\n\u201cI believe this is the greatest thrill,\u201d Sharman said.\n\nOwner Jack Kent Cooke told Hearn he nearly suffered a heart attack as the Lakers desperately held on.\n\n\u201cBut it was all worth it, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d he said to Hearn.\n\nTen days later in Baltimore, the Lakers got 37 points and nine assists from West to pass the 1916 New York Giants with 27 straight wins. Those Giants had won 26 without a loss, though there was a non-counting tie during their streak.\n\nAnd in Atlanta on Jan. 7, the Lakers were as dominant as ever, making 58% of their shots while six players scored in double figures in a blowout win against Pete Maravich and the Hawks.\n\nIt was the team\u2019s 33rd win in a row.\n\nTwo days later in Milwaukee against the defending NBA champions, the Lakers would finally lose 120-104.\n\n\u201cWe went into the locker room after the game and it was over with, the 33 wins a row,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe got on a plane.\u201d\n\nThe season would end with another victory that ended another streak: The Lakers finally won an NBA championship after losing seven finals in the first 11 years since moving to L.A. But the memory of the 33-game win streak would always linger.\n\n\u201cSome 2\u00bd months without losing a game,\u201d West said. \u201cPretty remarkable.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/recap/_/gameId/401360570", "page_content": "ATLANTA -- \u2014 Trae Young believes a defensive revival has the Atlanta Hawks back on track. That defense finally showed up in the final quarter against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nYoung had 36 points and 12 assists, and the Hawks earned their seventh straight win by rallying to beat the Lakers 129-121 on Sunday.\n\nThe Hawks outscored Los Angeles 38-20 in the final period, when Young scored 13 points.\n\n\u201cIf our mindset is right we get stops on the defensive end ... I think we have a good chance of winning any night,\u201d Young said.\n\nOnyeka Okongwu scored 12 of his 16 points in the final period, when he helped hold Anthony Davis to five of his 27 points.\n\nMalik Monk led Los Angeles with 33 points in the Lakers\u2019 third consecutive loss, all without LeBron James.\n\nJames was not with the team due to continued swelling in his left knee. He returned to Los Angeles for treatment.\n\nThe Hawks (24-25) matched their longest win streak of the season by charging back after trailing 101-91 entering the fourth quarter. The Lakers scored a season-high 71 points in the first half while making 71.4% of their shots from the field, but they couldn't continue the hot shooting in the final period.\n\nDavis helped power the Lakers' strong start with 18 first-half points in his return after missing one game with a sore right wrist.\n\nMonk's eighth 3-pointer tied it at 121. De'Andre Hunter made one of two free throws for Atlanta before Young rattled in a 3-pointer for a four-point lead.\n\nYoung stretched the lead by making two free throws with 25 seconds remaining.\n\nEntering Sunday's games, the Hawks were 10th in the Eastern Conference. Atlanta, which lost to Milwaukee in last season's Eastern Conference final, was 12th before the winning streak.\n\nThe Lakers (24-27), who were ninth in the Western Conference, fell a season-low three games below .500.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in the position we want to be right now but that\u2019s OK,\u201d said Russell Westbrook, who had 20 points and 12 assists. \u201cWe know what we need to do as a team. Just find a way to get over the hump and close games out.\u201d\n\nMonk was on target in his return after missing one game with soreness in his left groin. Monk went 4 for 5 from 3-point range in the first half and 8 for 14 from deep for the game. His last-second 3 capped a 10-2 run to close the half, sending the Lakers into the break with a 71-62 lead.\n\nMonk set a season high by scoring 29 points in the Lakers' 134-118 home win over the Hawks on Jan. 7. Monk again feasted on Atlanta's defense to set a new high mark for the season.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nLakers: The 71 first-half points set a season high for either half. The Lakers made 30 of 42 shots from the field (71.4%) in the half. They finished at 54% (48 of 87) after making only 7 of 22 shots in the final period.\n\nHawks: John Collins had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and Clint Capela scored 15 points. ... Atlanta also won seven consecutive games from Nov. 14-26.\n\nOKONGWU THE CLOSER\n\nOkongwu continues to emerge as a key backup on Atlanta\u2019s front line. He played the full 12 minutes in the final period, almost doubling his first-half time on the court. Capela, the starting center, did not play the final period.\n\n\u201cHe was doing a good job of keeping his body between (Davis) and the basket,\u201d Hawks coach Nate McMillan said. \u201cI decided to just stay with him and finish the game.\u201d\n\nOkongwu had four dunks in the final period.\n\nNO LEBRON\n\nLakers coach Frank Vogel said before the game that an MRI on James\u2019 knee revealed \u201cgeneral swelling.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the long as the swelling is there he\u2019s going to be out,\u201d Vogel said.\n\nLOSING ROAD TRIP\n\nThe Lakers capped a 2-4 road trip with losses to Philadelphia, Charlotte and Atlanta.\n\n\u201cWe were close but just have fallen short in the last couple,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cWe played well the last two games. We fell short in the end. We\u2019ve just got to get home and put this trip behind us ... and get ready for the next game, whether LeBron is in or out.\u201d\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLakers: Host Portland on Wednesday night.\n\nHawks: Host Toronto on Monday night.\n\n------"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/recap/_/gameId/401071521", "page_content": "ATLANTA -- Trae Young knew he'd have to carry a heavy load, and that was OK with him.\n\nThe rookie was pumped to face LeBron James.\n\nYoung had 22 points and 14 assists, John Collins also scored 22 points despite foul trouble, and the Atlanta Hawks defeated James and the Los Angeles Lakers 117-113 on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Hawks snapped a three-game losing streak despite a triple-double from James, who had 28 points, 16 assists and 11 rebounds.\n\n\"I try to live in big moments,\" Young said. \"I feel like I belong here. He's one of the best players of all time. But when I'm out on the court, I'm trying to compete and get a win.\"\n\nYoung matched his season high by playing 38 minutes, taking on a greater burden after the Hawks bought out the contract of his veteran backup, Jeremy Lin. With Jaylen Adams sidelined by a sprained right ankle, Young was the only true point guard on the roster.\n\n\"It was definitely different,\" Young said. Asked if he was tired, he said with a smile, \"A little bit.\"\n\nDespite chants of \"Kobe's better\" from the sellout crowd of 16,824, James was cheered loudly by a hefty contingent of Lakers fans. He turned in a dazzling effort, equaling his season high by playing 43 minutes, but it wasn't enough to make up for the subpar group around him.\n\nThe Lakers dropped 2 1/2 games behind Sacramento for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.\n\n\"We either make it or we don't make it,\" James said. \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nBut the frustration was apparent on his face when he stormed straight to the locker room as soon as the horn sounded.\n\n\"Some guys have never played a playoff game before,\" James said. \"You can't teach them that. It's very important to understand how important every game is, no matter who you're playing or where you are.\"\n\nBoth teams struggled mightily in the final quarter after an up-and-down track meet over the first three periods. The Hawks made just 5 of 19 shots over the final 12 minutes; the Lakers weren't much better, hitting 6 of 22. The teams combined to go 3 of 18 from 3-point range.\n\nThe Hawks scored just seven points in the final 6:33 but managed to hold on. Taurean Prince delivered a key 3-pointer with 1:48 remaining, and Young darted past James for a lay-in and a foul that thwarted any hope of a Lakers comeback.\n\nIt sure didn't start out that way.\n\nAtlanta tied a franchise record for 3-pointers in a quarter, going 10 of 17 in the opening period for a 38-32 lead. The Lakers fought back to take a 69-65 edge at the half, but Atlanta pulled ahead for good to lead 100-95 going to the fourth.\n\nThe Lakers had a chance after an Atlanta turnover led to a driving basket by James, cutting the Hawks' lead to 116-113. But after desperately trying to come up with a steal, Los Angeles was forced to foul Kevin Huerter with 4.3 seconds left. He made the second of two free throws to seal the victory.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nLakers: James' triple-double was his fifth this season. ... Rajon Rondo was charged with six turnovers. ... Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram scored 19 points apiece.\n\nHawks: After matching its record for 3s in a quarter, set Oct. 21 at Cleveland, Atlanta missed all six of its attempts beyond the arc the next period. ... Forty-two-year-old Vince Carter turned in some crucial minutes, contributing 11 points, five rebounds and three assists after sitting out Sunday's loss to Orlando. ... Collins picked up his fifth foul with 7:19 remaining but managed to make it to the end.\n\nINJURY REPORT\n\nThe Lakers were without center Tyson Chandler, who was sidelined by a toe injury. Mike Muscala dressed despite a sprained right ankle, but didn't play against his former team.\n\nAdams is set to take over as Atlanta's backup point guard as soon as he is recovered from his ankle injury. In his absence, DeAndre' Bembry and Kent Bazemore shared the playmaking duties when Young wasn't on the court.\n\n\"Those guys did a good job of keeping up afloat,\" Carter said.\n\nSTAYING PUT\n\nThe Lakers stuck with the same starting five they used in Sunday's loss at Philadelphia.\n\nNewcomer Reggie Bullock, acquired last week from Detroit, took the court with James, Kuzma, Ingram and JaVale McGee.\n\nCoach Luke Walton said he wanted to give that group another look before deciding if further changes are needed.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLakers: Head into the All-Star break after completing a six-game trip. They don't play again until Feb. 21, when Los Angeles will host James Harden and the Houston Rockets.\n\nHawks: Host the New York Knicks on Thursday in their final game before the break.\n\n---\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

And all six of them came back to Los Angeles. One of them is back for a second time. One took a decade to return. Four of them were champions with the franchise. All of them had unfinished business in L.A. Lakers vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka took the sentiment \"once a Laker, always a Laker\" quite literally this offseason, using primarily Lakers alumni to pad the roster around his revamped Big Three.\n\nWith all six players signed to veteran minimum or non-guaranteed deals, a realistic assessment of the returnees could simply be \"you get what you pay for.\" However, the Lakers' championship chances could hinge on the production of these role players come playoff time nearly as much as it does the guys signed to max contracts.\n\nHere's a roll call of the purple and gold's prodigal sons.\n\nCenter Dwight Howard is back for his third stint with the Los Angeles Lakers. AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill\n\n- Tenure with Lakers: 2012-13, 2019-20\n\n- Averages with Lakers: 12.5 points, 10.0 rebounds and 1.8 blocks in 145 games\n\nWhat happened the first (and second) time around?\n\nAs awkward as Howard's first stint with the team was, his second go-around with the franchise more than made up for it. Back in 2012, the 27-year-old Howard was supposed to be the next great center in the Lakers' long line of legendary big men. But after a season of infighting with Kobe Bryant and then-head coach Mike D'Antoni, combined with physical setbacks stemming from back surgery and a torn labrum in his shoulder, he bolted for Houston despite the Lakers' desperate billboard campaign to keep him. After unremarkable stops in Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte and Washington, he returned in 2019 with a narrower skill set that fit perfectly into Frank Vogel's defense-first approach. Perhaps his greatest feat? Neutralizing Denver's Nikola Jokic with his physical play in the 2020 Western Conference finals, adding to an already Hall of Fame-worthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with his first NBA title.\n\nWhy did Howard leave?\n\nNo one is quite sure. Could be impatience on Howard's part. Could be poor communication on the Lakers' part. Howard came back to the Lakers on a non-guaranteed deal in '19, telling the team that he preferred to earn his way onto the roster. After filling his role with aplomb, both sides had mutual interest in a return. But either the Lakers were slow to make Howard a formal offer or Howard was recruited away by Philadelphia's Joel Embiid -- or both -- and he spent last season with the Sixers.\n\nWhy is Howard back (again)?\n\n\"What brought me back to the Lakers?\" Howard said, repeating the question during his (re)introductory news conference last month. \"Love for the game, love for this city, love for the team and just [the] opportunity to win, you know?\" Simple enough.\n\nWhat the Lakers are expecting of him in 2021-22\n\nHoward will be tasked with being Davis' bodyguard once again and providing a key defensive presence. He was missed along with JaVale McGee last season in the Lakers' big man rotation that featured Marc Gasol and Montrezl Harrell.\n\nRajon Rondo is returning to the Lakers after spending last season with the Atlanta Hawks and the LA Clippers. AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill\n\n- Tenure with Lakers: 2018-20\n\n- Averages with Lakers: 8.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 6.1 assists in 94 games\n\nWhat happened the first time around?\n\nRondo came to Los Angeles with LeBron James in 2018, and after missing the playoffs, they paired together as the Lakers' primary playmakers on their way to the championship in the Orlando bubble. While his first go-round was marred by injuries -- including fracturing his right thumb during practice following the league's restart in the summer of 2020 -- he was a stud on the Lakers' road to the title, averaging 8.9 points and 6.6 assists while shooting 40% from 3.\n\nWhy did Rondo leave?\n\nHe got paid. Coming off the championship, the Atlanta Hawks offered him a two-year, $15 million deal to provide veteran leadership to a team that needed it. Los Angeles, already above the cap, used its mid-level exception to sign Harrell and could offer Rondo only a veteran minimum deal to stay.\n\nWhy is Rondo back?\n\n\"We didn't get our parade,\" Rondo said during his first comments to the media after clearing waivers and rejoining the team. \"I obviously want a parade here in L.A.\" Indeed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 NBA champions didn't get to enjoy the usual pomp and circumstance that accompanies winning the Larry O'Brien Trophy. The Lakers monitored informal workouts with other free-agent point guards this offseason, with Rondo ultimately landing a contract after reaching a buyout with Memphis because of his experience and prior relationships.\n\nWhat the Lakers are expecting of him in 2021-22\n\nRondo will be a coach on the floor -- and on the bench -- shouldering the ballhandling responsibilities with Kendrick Nunn and Talen Horton-Tucker when James and Russell Westbrook aren't on the court.\n\nTrevor Ariza last played for the Lakers in 2009. AP Photo/David J. Phillip\n\n- Tenure with Lakers: 2007-09\n\n- Averages with Lakers: 8.3 points, 4.1 rebounds and 1.5 steals in 106 games\n\nWhat happened the first time around?\n\nAriza was just 22 years old when he first joined the Lakers in 2007, and in his second season played all 82 games, then literally stole away the Denver Nuggets' momentum in the Western Conference finals with two game-sealing swipes. Ariza meshed well alongside Bryant, giving the Lakers two solid defenders on the wings who could turn steals and deflections into fast-break opportunities.\n\nWhy did Ariza leave?\n\nThe Lakers used their cap space in the 2009 offseason to sign Ron Artest, prompting Ariza to sign a five-year, $33 million deal with the Houston Rockets team that Artest had just departed. Los Angeles went on to repeat as champions, while Ariza carved out a solid 3-and-D career with the Rockets, Hornets, Wizards, Suns, Kings, Blazers and Heat.\n\nWhy is Ariza back?\n\n\"Russ got traded, and 20 minutes after he got traded, he was on my phone,\" Ariza said, detailing the recruiting effort by his fellow former UCLA Bruins teammate. There have been several times when Ariza was on the Lakers' radar in recent years. This time the interest was mutual.\n\nWhat the Lakers are expecting of him in 2021-22\n\nShooting and defense -- critical for a team that looks to have little of either -- and providing backup minutes at small forward and shooting guard. At 36, the Lakers will have to manage his workload, but the 17-year-vet is coming off a season with the Heat in which he averaged 9.4 points and 4.8 rebounds per game and shot 35% from 3 in 28 minutes.\n\nKent Bazemore played one season for the Lakers in 2013-14. Gary Dineen/Getty Images\n\n- Tenure with Lakers: 2013-14\n\n- Averages with Lakers: 13.1 points, 3.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 23 games\n\nWhat happened the first time around?\n\nMuch like new teammate Wayne Ellington, Bazemore enjoyed a first stint in L.A. that was good for him personally (he averaged 13.1 points, which remains his career best) but not so good for the team (the Lakers went 27-55) as injuries ravaged the roster.\n\nWhy did Bazemore leave?\n\nAlthough Bazemore performed well in his 23-game debut in Los Angeles, the franchise renounced his rights to clear cap space in its free-agency pursuit of Carmelo Anthony, who ultimately re-signed with the New York Knicks. Bazemore then signed a two-year, $4 million deal with the Atlanta Hawks and turned that into a four-year, $70 million extension in 2016.\n\nESPN Daily podcast Monday through Friday, host Pablo Torre brings you an inside look at the most interesting stories at ESPN, as told by the top reporters and insiders on the planet. Listen\n\nWhy is Bazemore back?\n\n\"The Lakers were very, very persistent,\" Bazemore said. \"I heard from Mr. Pelinka and Coach Vogel a ton over the first couple hours of the evening once free agency started. So they really brought an amazing energy to the table. It really felt like I had a place on that roster to really make a difference.\"\n\nWhat the Lakers are expecting of him in 2021-22\n\nDefense. Even though Bazemore is entering his 10th NBA season, the 32-year-old is among the younger players on the roster. He'll be asked to reciprocate the \"amazing energy\" the Lakers' brass brought to their recruiting effort., making up for the ball-hawking presence on defense that L.A. lost with the departures of Alex Caruso and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.\n\nWayne Ellington averaged 10.0 points for the Lakers in 2014-15. Andrew D. Bernstein/Getty Images\n\n- Tenure with Lakers: 2014-15\n\n- Averages with Lakers: 10.0 points, 3.7 rebounds and 37.0 3P% in 65 games\n\nWhat happened the first time around?\n\nEllington had the unenviable distinction of having a pretty good season for a very bad Lakers team in 2014-15. He averaged 10.0 points and 3.2 rebounds per game, while shooting 37% from 3, but Los Angeles went just 21-61, the team's worst record in history to that point.\n\nWhy did Ellington leave?\n\nHe signed a one-year, $1.5 million deal with the Brooklyn Nets, joining what was his sixth team in his seven years in the league at that point.\n\nWhy is Ellington back?\n\n\"[Pelinka] told me how he thought I could help this team, and told me that he had tried to get me in the past and it didn't work out,\" Ellington said. \"And to be honest, it didn't really take a lot, because I had already looked at the team and I saw and I felt that I could really help in a lot of ways.\"\n\nWhat the Lakers are expecting of him in 2021-22\n\nPotentially to be their starting shooting guard. With a career 38.2% mark from 3, Ellington provides a viable floor spacer to keep defenses honest when James and Westbrook look to attack the paint.\n\nAvery Bradley was a late addition to the Los Angeles Lakers roster after he was waived by Golden State. Richard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports\n\n- Tenure with Lakers: 2019-20\n\n- Averages with Lakers: 8.6 points, 1.3 3FGM and 1.3 assists in 49 games\n\nWhat happened the first time around?\n\nThe Lakers added Bradley with one of their final roster spots in the summer of 2019 as they looked to build their team with defensive-minded players surrounding LeBron James and Anthony Davis. Bradley's worth was proved in his absence during an early-season injury, when coach Frank Vogel created the \"Avery Challenge,\" to test his team to reach certain defensive metrics that Bradley's presence would usually help them meet. While he received a ring for his contributions to the team, he was not with the Lakers when they won the championship in Orlando, Florida. He opted out of the bubble because of family health concerns.\n\nWhy did Bradley leave?\n\nHe originally signed a two-year deal worth $9.7 million to come to the Lakers with a player option and opted out of the $5 million for Year 2 to sign a far more lucrative one-year deal with the Miami Heat for $11.6 million. Bradley, who contracted COVID-19 and never found his footing with the Heat, was dealt from Miami to the Houston Rockets at the trade deadline and finished the season with the Rockets before hitting free agency.\n\nWhy is Bradley back?\n\nBradley competed for a roster spot on the Golden State Warriors at training camp and even declared during his time there, \"I think I might be the best on-ball defender in the NBA.\" They waived the 11-year veteran before the season started. The Lakers, which held their 15th and final roster spot open to give themselves flexibility should an opportunity arise, picked Bradley up off the waiver wire and signed him to a non-guaranteed contract, sources told ESPN.\n\nWhat the Lakers are expecting of him in 2021-22\n\nWith Trevor Ariza and Talen Horton-Tucker sidelined with injuries to start the season, Bradley gives L.A. a trusted wing defender Vogel can go to. Sources said that Bradley's familiarity with Vogel's schemes, having been part of the program so recently, will allow him to assimilate quickly without needing the reps at camp to fit in. Considering the deal is non-guaranteed, Bradley will have a shot to impress in the short term, but should the Lakers' wings get healthy, they can move on from Bradley and reopen the 15th spot."}, {"url": "https://lebronwire.usatoday.com/lists/lakers-player-grades-lebron-monk-atlanta-hawks-trae-young-avery-bradley-tht-melo/", "page_content": "The Los Angeles Lakers made it four wins in a row after defeating the Atlanta Hawks, 134-118.\n\nThis marked the first matchup between the two sides this season, and Trae Young, John Collins and Bogdan Bogdanovic all played after missing recent games.\n\nThat didn\u2019t matter, however, for the Lakers. Los Angeles scored at least 30 points every quarter and manipulated Atlanta\u2019s shaky defense with ease.

It\u2019s the ninth time in the last 10 games James has scored at least 30.\n\n\u201cI think the guys are just getting comfortable with the way we\u2019re playing right now,\u201d coach Frank Vogel said.\n\nThe vibes inside the building were as good as they\u2019ve been all season, the Lakers well on their way to their fourth win in a row, with highlight plays forced by their swarming defense pushing the crowd into a frenzy.\n\nThe building bounced as the Laker Girls danced to Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cLevitating\u201d moments after James floated to catch a lob from Talen Horton-Tucker on a fast break triggered by a perfect Russell Westbrook bounce pass.\n\nHorton-Tucker finished with 21 points, and Westbrook had 13 assists, 11 rebounds and nine rebounds before fouling out.\n\nLakers guard Malik Monk (29 points) dunks during a 134-118 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night. (Ashley Landis / Associated Press)\n\nFittingly, Monk punctuated his best game of the season with a two-handed putback slam. He finished with 29 points.\n\n\u201cSuper momentum,\u201d Monk said. \u201cEveryone loves dunks.\u201d\n\nThe win moved the Lakers (21-19) two games ahead of .500 for the first time since Dec. 15. It\u2019s also the team\u2019s first four-game winning streak of the season.\n\nThe Lakers probably couldn\u2019t even think about .500 basketball without Avery Bradley, whom the team signed this preseason after he was the Golden State Warriors\u2019 final cut.\n\nHis willingness to play pressure defense with sincere effort and consistency was even more obvious considering so many of the team\u2019s best defenders found themselves either traded or left to sign elsewhere during the postseason.\n\nGuaranteeing the rest of his one-year contract, which the Lakers did Friday, was one of the easiest decisions the team has made this season.\n\n\u201cObviously, you start your season out a certain way and you find ways to enhance it throughout the course of the year,\u201d Vogel said before the game. \u201cWe were able to pick up Avery I think right before the beginning of the season without much of a training camp, and he hit the ground running with us, obviously having a little bit of a background in our system, being here a few years ago, played extremely well for us, deserved a starting role.\u201d\n\nWhile Vogel can say, like he did before the game, that the Lakers would\u2019ve found another player to try to harass the opponent\u2019s best scoring guard, only Bradley has shown the ability to go out and do it. And even if some of the advanced metrics have been unkind to him at times this season.\n\n\u201cTenacity is contagious. Intensity and playing hard is contagious,\u201d Vogel said before he had Bradley shadow Hawks star Trae Young. \u201cAnd knowing that you\u2019re OK on certain matchups against elite offensive guards coming in here, it\u2019s almost necessary. ... To win in this league, it\u2019s necessary to have somebody that can hold his own and then some against the elite guards.\u201d\n\nLakers Complete coverage: The Lakers\u2019 33-game winning streak 50th anniversary For 65 days and 33 games, the Los Angeles Lakers were unbeatable during the 1971-72 season.

The Lakers also got Stanley Johnson back in their starting lineup after re-signing him via a 10-day contract to fill the vacant roster spot created by their Rajon Rondo trade.\n\nJohnson\u2019s return to the Lakers\u2019 starting unit signaled further commitment to playing small despite Atlanta\u2019s athletic frontcourt of John Collins and Clint Capela.\n\nThe Lakers countered with quickness, forcing turnovers and getting out into transition. James, left to patrol the paint with Anthony Davis still nursing a knee injury, repeatedly slapped the ball away from the Hawks\u2019 bigs.\n\nWith his fourth steal of the game, James moved into the NBA\u2019s all-time top 10.\n\nThe Lakers were out-rebounded by just two while they forced the Hawks into 15 turnovers. The Lakers converted the mistakes into 28 points.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when this team is going to be at its best,\u201d Vogel said. \u201c\u2026 If we don\u2019t beat ourselves, we can be tough to beat.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/story/2022-01-08/avery-bradley-contract-picked-up-lakers-defeat-hawks-lebron-james", "page_content": "Avery Bradley played well in a win over Atlanta the same day the Lakers picked up his contract for the rest of the season.\n\nFrom the beginning, Avery Bradley was on his game \u2014 offensively and defensively. And then as the action reached tense moments in the fourth quarter, Bradley was on his game again \u2014 offensively and defensively.\n\nBradley completed his night with 21 points and six rebounds. His menacing defense on dangerous point guard Trae Young also was paramount to the Lakers\u2019 134-118 victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Friday night at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nBradley opened the first quarter with 13 points, going five for six from the field and two for three from three-point range.\n\nHe had five points in the fourth quarter, going two for three from the field and one for two from three-point range.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked afterward what activated his offense, Bradley simply said it was his \u201cdefense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets me moving. It gets me thinking,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cI think it just makes the game that much easier for me on the offensive end. But credit to Russell Westbrook and LeBron [James]. They\u2019re making the game a lot easier for me. I\u2019m able to cut. I\u2019m able to shoot open threes. Whatever it is, I\u2019m just trying to play as hard as I can. And whatever shots come to me, make sure I\u2019m able to knock them down.\u201d\n\nBradley\u2019s primary role was to slow down Young, and the Lakers\u2019 guard did his part, helping to hold the Hawks guard to 25 points on eight-for-21 shooting.\n\nBut it also was Bradley\u2019s offense that made his teammates take notice.\n\nWith the Lakers holding a 10-point lead late in the fourth quarter, Bradley cut under the basket and scored on a layup off a pass from Westbrook.\n\nThen with 4 minutes, 7 seconds left, Bradley sealed the game with a three-pointer off a pass from Carmelo Anthony.\n\n\u201cWe want him [Bradley] being aggressive,\u201d Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. \u201cEvery time we shake hands before the game, we know what he\u2019s gonna bring on the defensive side of the ball, but I\u2019m always telling him be aggressive shooting the basketball, looking for your catch-and-shoots.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really helped us out in a lot of situations the last few games with cuts in late possessions where it looks like we\u2019re stuck, and all of a sudden he\u2019ll break free under the basket and that saved a number of key possessions in the last few games. And we want him staying aggressive offensively.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers have won four in a row, and Bradley has been on a mini tear in the three games they have played in January.\n\nHe\u2019s averaging 10.5 points, 3.0 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 2.0 steals. He\u2019s shooting 61.5% from the field and 37.5% from three-point range.\n\n\u201cHe never tries to do too much, never tries to do something he can\u2019t do, and he literally gets the most out of what he does every single night, and for us it\u2019s never about him making shots,\u201d James said. \u201cHe brings a defensive intensity that everybody just feeds off of. Then when you have a game where he has 13 in the first quarter and he\u2019s aggressive offensively, that\u2019s all extra credit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all extra that we love, and we always want him to be more aggressive offensively because he shoots it extremely well, but it\u2019s just, it\u2019s a treat to have him.\u201d\n\nEarlier Friday, the Lakers guaranteed Bradley\u2019s contract for the rest of the season. During the game, Bradley demonstrated why the Lakers made a smart investment on his $2.6-million contract.\n\nThe Lakers acquired Bradley off waivers on Oct. 18, one day before the regular season started. He had spent the 2019-20 season with the Lakers and was already familiar with them.\n\nNow Bradley is starting and producing.\n\n\u201cWe were able to pick up Avery, I think, right before the beginning of the season without much of a training camp and he hit the ground running with us,\u201d Vogel said. \u201cObviously, having a little bit of a background in our system, being here a few years ago, played extremely well for us, deserved a starting role, brings that defensive presence but also playing really well offensively.\n\n\u201cHappy to see him get his deal guaranteed.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/atlanta-hawks-vs-la-lakers-prediction-match-preview-january-7th-2022-nba-season-2021-22", "page_content": "The Atlanta Hawks will continue their road trip as they head to California to face the LA Lakers at Crypto.com Arena on January 7th for Friday night's action.\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks will head into the fifth game of their road trip, coming off a 108-102 victory against the Sacramento Kings.

With two wins and two losses, the Hawks have managed to stay afloat. However, given their 17-20 record, this doesn't improve their situation much.\n\nIn their win against Sacramento, the Atlanta Hawks managed to cut a significant Kings lead and then pull away in the final minutes to earn a victory.\n\nWithout their key players, Trae Young and John Collins, Atlanta relied on the collective efforts and contributions of teammates such as Kevin Huerter, Cam Reddish and Danilo Gallinari, among others.\n\nWith six players recording double-digit scoring, the Atlanta Hawks also saw great minutes from Clint Capela, who finished the game with 11 points and 14 rebounds.\n\nAlthough the Atlanta Hawks will celebrate that win on the road, they may face some roster trouble ahead of their matchup against the LA Lakers. But given the importance of the game, Trae Young and John Collins should be available.\n\nKey Player - John Collins\n\nJohn Collins attempts a jump shot\n\nComing out of health and safety protocols earlier this week, John Collins will be the difference maker for the Atlanta Hawks in this matchup against the LA Lakers.\n\nStepping up as a star for the Hawks, Collins is the perfect pick-and-roll partner for a shifty point guard such as Trae Young.\n\nGifted with athleticism and fundamentally sound rebounding skills, he also wields a smooth jump shot from midrange and from deep, allowing him to stretch the floor.\n\nSportsCenter @SportsCenter ANOTHER JOHN COLLINS POSTER \ud83e\udd2f ANOTHER JOHN COLLINS POSTER \ud83e\udd2f https://t.co/j9rPipmrC2\n\nJohn Collins has missed the Atlanta Hawks' last five games. The big man is undergoing reconditioning and is hoping to make his comeback soon.\n\nAlthough his status for the game is questionable, given the period of time needed to get into shape, Collins should be available to start for Atlanta. However, he may also need to be on minutes restriction.\n\nAtlanta Hawks Predicted Lineup\n\nG - Trae Young | G - Bogdan Bogdanovic | F - Cam Reddish | F - John Collins | C - Clint Capela\n\nLA Lakers Preview\n\nSacramento Kings v Los Angeles Lakers\n\nThe LA Lakers will head into this matchup on the back of a three-game winning streak. Putting an end to a miserable losing slide that saw them fall below .500, the Purple and Gold will enjoy a winning record at the start of 2022.\n\nTheir last three games have seen the positive results of starting their superstar LeBron James at center. In Anthony Davis' absence, the Lakers have had to make significant adjustments to compensate for the loss of their prized big man.\n\nWith LeBron starting at center, the Lakers have a 4-0 record and have witnessed some of the best basketball the superstar has played in recent times. Coming off a 31-point outing, featuring some clutch baskets to seal the game, LeBron James continues to be the driving force for the LA Lakers.\n\nThe team will also be making some moves ahead of Friday night's game. With roster adjustments clearing up space to sign other players, the LA Lakers' current lineup is still subject to change.\n\nStanley Johnson's return, having been signed to another 10-day contract, could very well point to another start at center for LeBron James on Friday.\n\nKey Player - Malik Monk\n\nMalik Monk celebrates a play\n\nThe LA Lakers will need Malik Monk to step up as a key player for the side in Friday night's marquee matchup.\n\nMonk has been a great pickup in the offseason and it shows in his output. As a scorer and three-point shooter, the Lakers guard has been one of the most reliable players on the roster.\n\nStatMuse @statmuse Malik Monk last 6 games:\n\n\n\n20.7 PPG\n\n56.6 FG%\n\n45.5 3P% on 7.3 attempts\n\n\n\nHe leads the Lakers with +125 +/- this season, +30 higher than the next player.

Going toe-to-toe with Buddy Hield in a second-half shootout, Malik Monk held his own and managed to get the Lakers within striking distance to steal the game away.\n\nHeading into the match against the Hawks, the LA Lakers may opt to go with a bigger lineup to counter Atlanta's size. This may result in Monk moving back to the bench.\n\nAlthough this could affect his overall productivity, the Lakers will hope that the 23-year-old can continue his consistent contributions.\n\nLA Lakers Predicted Lineup\n\nG - Russell Westbrook | G - Avery Bradley | F - LeBron James | F - Trevor Ariza | C - Dwight Howard\n\nHawks vs Lakers Match Predictions\n\nFriday night's marquee matchup looks to be an enticing game to say the least. With both teams eager to rise through the ranks of their respective conference standings, there is a lot at stake.\n\nHowever, given the questionable state of Atlanta's roster, the odds do not favor the Hawks. While factoring in the LA Lakers' current form, playing LA at home presents another tall order for Atlanta's shorthanded lineup.\n\nShould Atlanta have their key pieces available, their chances of winning will increase.\n\nWhere to watch Hawks vs Lakers game?\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks vs LA Lakers game will be broadcast nationally on ESPN.
