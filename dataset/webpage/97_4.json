However, his explosive dashes out of the half back line and ball carrying ability did catch the attention of North Melbourne recruiters, and after 43 senior games with the Boroughs between 1990 and 1993, King was taken at number 46 in the 1993 National Draft.\n\nAt North Melbourne, where he fitted seamlessly into an already strong line-up, King enjoyed a very solid first year before going from strength to strength. During the course of an 11-season, 241 game, 145-goal AFL career, he achieved virtually everything the modern game has to offer. A tough, pacy, relentlessly aggressive footballer, he was equally adept in a number of positions, including the wing, a back pocket or half back flank, and ruck-rover. He was a key contributor to the 'Roos 1996 and 1999 premiership victories, and made the AFL All Australian team in 1997 and 1998. He also represented Victoria. David King retired at the end of the 2004 season.\n\nAuthor - John Devaney with additional material from Adam Cardosi"}, {"url": "https://forever.collingwoodfc.com.au/one-hit-wonders-david-king/", "page_content": "One Hit Wonders: David King\n\nBy Glenn McFarlane, of the Herald Sun\n\nCollingwood\u2019s David King had a much shorter league career than his North Melbourne namesake, yet his brief strut on the AFL stage wasn\u2019t without a few attention-grabbing moments.\n\nIn all, he played only nine games, all of them in the 2004 season.\n\nBut the kid with the mop of blond hair and an uncanny knack of kicking a goal at the right time made an impact far exceeding his time in the black and white jumper.\n\nEven before his debut game, this one-time Australian under 16s basketball representative who had once toured Mexico was a surprise draft selection for the Magpies. Then recruiting manager Noel Judkins plucked him out as pick 58 of the 2002 national draft as a 17-year-old, having played for Sacred Heart and in a few games with Glenelg under 17s and under 19s.\n\nHe moved across to Melbourne with two of his mates from Adelaide, who had also been drafted \u2013 Andrew Mackie, who was picked up by Geelong, and Jared Rivers, who was taken by Melbourne.\n\nKing spent the 2003 season playing with Collingwood\u2019s VFL affiliate Williamstown, slotting into a team that at times included a kid called Dane Swan and a young rookie called Nick Maxwell.\n\nHis timing was almost impeccable. Not only was he one of Williamstown\u2019s best players in the VFL Grand Final, playing a big role in the club\u2019s premiership win, but it also put his hand up potentially for an even bigger call-up.\n\nCollingwood coach Mick Malthouse ended King\u2019s relative anonymity in the leading up to the 2003 AFL Grand Final when he suggested the 18-year-old could be a shock inclusion for the clash with Brisbane Lions. Never mind the fact he was still a teenager and that he hadn\u2019t played a senior game, Malthouse suggested he was right in the mix.\n\nDuring Grand Final week, Malthouse said of King: \u201cHis form has warranted being selected, we\u2019ll certainly consider it. He wouldn\u2019t be the first and won\u2019t be the last picked in a Grand Final to play (his first game). I don\u2019t think the birth certificate tells you anything. But you have to weigh up, is the player mature enough to take on the responsibility on that day?\u201d\n\n\u201cPhysically he is equipped, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t be training. He\u2019s a very tough-minded person and, at the worst, he gets an experience of training at a level that\u2019s intense prior to a Grand Final.\u201d\n\nKing would say the experience of training in front of so many Magpie fans at Victoria Park in the lead-up was \u201cpretty exciting \u2026 there were more people at training than at half the games I\u2019ve played in.\u201d\n\nNo player had made his debut in a Grand Final since Collingwood\u2019s Keith Batchelor in 1952.\n\nUltimately, Malthouse ultimately chose not to select King for the big match. He didn\u2019t play, and the Magpies lost.\n\nNo one can definitively say how close King was to being chosen, though the fact he was in the mix showed the sort of impact the 82kg, 183cm utility had made in a relatively short time.\n\nHe spent most of the following preseason training for a defensive role. It was in that role that he made his debut \u2013 along with Luke Mullins \u2013 in the Round 4 clash with Fremantle. He spent most of the game on the bench, but gave a few glimpses in the second half, which saw Malthouse say after the game: \u201c\u201dI think David\u2019s got a chance to play 50-100 (games) and he could play in excess of that if he gets his confidence.\u201d\n\nMost of his four games in a row came off the bench, and he returned to the VFL. He returned to the AFL side in Round 17 against the Western Bulldogs \u2013 as a forward \u2013 and he managed to kick the first of his eight career goals at the elite level. When he kicked his maiden goal, Collingwood players came from all areas of the ground to celebrate with him.\n\nThe high point of King\u2019s career with the Magpies came in his next two games.\n\nThe first came against Richmond in Round 18. He spent most of the game biding his time on the bench, then came out and lived every kid\u2019s dreams by kicking the match-winning goal. It was his second of the game, and it came with less than a minute left in the game to put the Magpies back in front.\n\nKing hadn\u2019t known how long was left on the time He hadn\u2019t known how long was left on the clock, but when Brodie Holland clock when Brodie Holland\u2019s handball found him in the goal square and he nailed a right foot shot from the goal square. His raised his arms in delight in front of the fans.\n\nThe final siren sounded soon after, leaving Collingwood five points in front. Interviewed by Andrew Maher on the field, King said: \u201cIt\u2019s what dreams are made of, really \u2026 Growing up as a kid; you always want to kick the last goal in a winning side. My heart is going; my heart is going really fast.\u201d\n\nThen he spoke to the waiting media in the rooms: \u201cBrodie gave me a good handball. I\u2019d much rather kick them on the run from there than a set shot from 40 metres.\u201d\n\nMalthouse said of King after the game: \u201cWe were bringing him up as a forward because he had a couple of weeks at Williamstown and kicked a couple of bags. He\u2019s come up and kicked a very important goal today, so it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nKing\u2019s parents watched his goal on television. They had travelled across to Melbourne the week before, for the Bulldogs game, but had returned to Adelaide.\n\nThe Herald Sun said of King: \u201cHe became an instant hero in the eyes of the Magpies army when, on the run, and at the end of a succession of handballs, he booted a major from the goal square to put his side five points in front of Richmond with fewer than 20 seconds remaining.\u201d\n\nHe kicked three more goals the following week against Fremantle at Subiaco. It was \u201ca spritely performance\u201d with his best goal coming in the last quarter when he snapped one over his head which halted the Dockers\u2019 run.\n\nHe kicked another goal against Essendon the following week. His ninth \u2013 and final \u2013 game in black and white came against Port Adelaide in Round 21, where he spent only minimal time on the field.\n\nSadly, persistent knee injuries and a lack of opportunities meant he could not break through for another game in 2005. He was delisted at the end of the season, and later played for Box Hill.\n\nIt was a short career highlighted by two magic moments \u2013 his match-winner against the Tigers and his three majors against the Dockers \u2013 in what was a two-week streak that Magpie fans won\u2019t forget in a hurry."}, {"url": "https://www.sen.com.au/news/2022/08/12/david-kings-all-australian-side-for-2022/", "page_content": "David King has named his All-Australian team for the 2022 AFL season.\n\nThe North Melbourne champion has made some brave selections, picking Geelong\u2019s Mark Blicavs and Collingwood\u2019s Josh Daicos on the wings.\n\nIt sparked a conversation with All-Australian selector Kane Cornes on SEN Breakfast.\n\n\u201cMy wings are Mark Blicavs and Josh Daicos,\u201d King said.\n\nCornes reacted: \u201cDoes Blicavs play wing?\u201d\n\nKing replied: \u201cHe does, yes, he has regularly.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll start on the wing and he\u2019ll roam from there, whether he goes forward, takes over a bit of ruck, goes behind the ball for support, or tags the opposition\u2019s best player.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s such a versatile guy, he is the wingman for me.\u201d\n\nCornes: \u201cHe\u2019s been more of an on-baller / back-up ruckman / tagger than a wingman, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nKing: \u201cFrom the wing.

According to the Bible, David grew up in the rugged Judean hills around the Israelite town of Bethlehem, a few miles south of what was then the Canaanite stronghold of Jerusalem. At the time, Israel was threatened by other peoples in the region, especially the Philistines, who occupied the Mediterranean coastal plain to the west. What was David\u2019s early life like? David was the youngest of eight sons of Jesse, a farmer and sheep breeder of the Israelite tribe of Judah. David likely spent much of his boyhood tending his family\u2019s flock. One day he was summoned from the fields by the prophet Samuel, who anointed him king of Israel while Saul was still king. What did David do for a living? As a youth, David distinguished himself as a musician and warrior. This gained him the attention of King Saul, for whom he played the harp and fought the Philistines. David\u2019s popularity aroused the king\u2019s jealousy. After Saul tried to kill him, David fled and became a leader of outlaws. When Saul died, David became king. What did David achieve? As Israel\u2019s second king, David built a small empire. He conquered Jerusalem, which he made Israel\u2019s political and religious centre. He defeated the Philistines so thoroughly that they never seriously threatened the Israelites\u2019 security again, and he annexed the coastal region. He went on to become the overlord of many small kingdoms bordering Israel.\n\nDavid, (flourished c. 1000 bce), second ruler of the united kingdom of ancient Israel and Judah. He founded the Judaean dynasty and united all the tribes of Israel under a single monarch. His son Solomon expanded the empire that David built. David is an important figure in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\n\nEarly life David slaying Goliath According to 1 Samuel, David was the youngest son of Jesse, a man of Bethlehem, and served as a shepherd for his father before beginning his career as an aide at the court of Saul, Israel\u2019s first king. When Israel came into conflict with the Philistines, a people from a neighbouring region, David\u2019s brothers went to fight for King Saul. Young David would travel back and forth to the camp to bring his brothers food and supplies. According to 1 Samuel 17, Goliath, a heavily armed Philistine giant, challenged Saul for 40 days to send out a man to fight him. No one would face this warrior until David, armed only with a sling and stones, volunteered. David hit the giant in the forehead with a stone and killed him. He continued to distinguish himself as a warrior in the ongoing battles against the Philistines, and his resultant popularity aroused Saul\u2019s jealousy. Fearing that the people would make David king, Saul plotted to kill him. With the help of his loyal friend Jonathan, Saul\u2019s eldest son, David fled into southern Judah and Philistia, on the coastal plain of Palestine, where, with great sagacity and foresight, he began to lay the foundations of his career. As an outlaw with a price on his head, David led the life of a Robin Hood on the desert frontier of his tribal domain in Judah (in the south of the Levant). He became the leader and organizer of a group of other outlaws and refugees, who progressively ingratiated themselves with the local population by protecting them from other bandits or, in case they had been raided, by pursuing the raiders and restoring the possessions that had been taken. Although the boy David was anointed by the prophet Samuel as the future king of Israel (1 Samuel 16), his actions in exile helped ensure that he would be \u201cinvited\u201d to become king as the true successor of Saul after Saul and Jonathan were slain in battle against the Philistines on Mount Gilboa."}, {"url": "https://www.nmfc.com.au/news/721286/draft-flashbacks-david-king", "page_content": "Every selection ever by North Melbourne at a National Draft\n\nPick Player Recruited from Games for North 14 Adam Simpson Northern U18, VIC 306 31 Mark Stevens Gippsland U18, VIC 21 46 David King Port Melbourne, VIC 241 60 Troy Polak Perth, WA 0 63 Gareth John Sydney, NSW 1\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus\n\nBefore the current trend of mature aged recruits, David King was 22-years-old when he made his debut for North, plucked from Port Melbourne in the 1993 National Draft.Considering King only played 43 senior games for Port Melbourne in four years, it was quite a gamble taken by the club\u2019s recruiting staff.Damian Drum was coach of Port in King\u2019s last season, but had left to join Sydney as an assistant coach.
