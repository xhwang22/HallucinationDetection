During Fall Out Boy\u2019s hiatus (2009-2012) he and Joe Trohman (lead guitarist of Fall Out Boy) formed the supergroup The Damned Things playing mainly heavy metal music.\n\nAndy was inspired and influenced by his favorite metal bands (Metallica, New Kids on the Block and Slayer).\n\nHe has been vegan and straight-edge since he was 16, and he is currently a CrossFit athlete.

Ever since he was a kid, he followed the belief that humans are supposed to live the way they used to live thousands of years ago, in their primitive state, but as he grew up, most of his beliefs faded.\n\nAndy Hurley was born Andrew John Hurley in Wisconsin on 31st May 1980 and lost his father when he was just 5. His mother took care of him for the rest of his childhood and teenage. Andy had saxophone as his very first musical instrument that he learned playing well and along with that, he also played percussion in his school\u2019s marching band.\n\nRecommended Lists:\n\nCareer\n\nAndy\u2019s introduction to professional music happened back when he was in the high school and was slowly gaining interest in playing drums. The year was 1996 and Andy was searching for opportunities to play with some big bands and in the pursuit of his dreams, he became part of several hardcore punk and heavy metal bands such as Killtheslavemaster, Racetraitor, Project Rocket and The Kill Pill. He was unable to find his true calling and kept trying different bands during this time.\n\nThe hardcore metal was getting popular in the late 90s and Andy\u2019s drumming skills got him gigs here and there but nothing concrete was coming across his way. However, things changed for the best in the year 2003, when one of his best high school friends Pete Wentz invited Andy to be a part of their band which was called the Fall Out Boy as they were in dire need of an additional drummer due to some troubles with their previous one, and it didn\u2019t take Andy much time to become a regular with Fall Out Boy.\n\nHis association with the band was extremely successful and despite the fact that this was the fourth band Andy was in, he got the fame in such a short time which he wasn\u2019t able to achieve through his previous stints in more than 5 years. Andy recorded the album \u2018Take This To Your Grave\u2019 with the band Fall Out Boy in 2003 to a mega universal success which helped Andy to become one of the hottest drummers around.\n\nIt was the first album by the band which was considered to be an actual hit and the band was reported by the media outlets to be the next big thing. The success continued with their next album titled \u2018From Under the Cork Tree\u2019, which climbed at the 9th spot in the Billboard 200 chart and the band spent the year 2005 touring around with their new found success. The album later went on to earn a Grammy nomination for the best New Artist.\n\nThe next two studio albums by the band titled \u2018Infinity on High\u2019 and \u2018Folie a Deux\u2019 also went on to achieve mega success in their concerts and digital downloads. However, Wentz faced severe emotional trouble during that time which also included a failed suicide attempt. It was being said that he is unable to handle the new found success the band was having and that, among several other things, led the band to take a break for some time in 2009.\n\nAndy got himself busy with several other projects and played for different bands such as a heavy metal band The Damned Things. The band was mostly a collaborative effort and featured members from Fall Out Boy, Anthrax and Every Time I Die and released their very first album titled \u2018Ironiclast\u2019. Enabler, another hard core band, hired Andy and in summer 2012, Enabler released their first album with Andy as a drummer titled \u2018All Hail the Void\u2019.\n\nLater in 2012, Andy joined a straight edge hard rock band named FocusedXminds, and during that time, media speculations were ripe about Fall Out Boy making a comeback and it was said that Andy will leave FocusedXminds when that happens. Fall Out Boy made a reappearance onto the musical sky in 2013, but Andy continued his association with FocusedXminds."}, {"url": "https://www.liquisearch.com/andy_hurley/early_life", "page_content": "Early Life\n\nHurley was born in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
