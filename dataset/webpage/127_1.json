During the six years since Dragonette\u2019s last recording, 2016\u2019s \u201cRoyal Blues,\u201d Sorbara experienced the final dissolution of the original creative partnership at the heart of Dragonette, the start of a new romantic relationship and the subsequent birth of her first child followed by the further life-disrupting chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, all the while wrestling with what form her musical career would take in the future.\n\nAll this upheaval audibly informs what might just be Dragonette\u2019s finest album yet, a mature, three-dimensional pop offering that grapples with the simultaneous terror and thrilling potential of Big Change before confidently accepting that sometimes Big Change is the only way forward.\n\n\u201cDragonette was on the gurney,\u201d admitted Sorbara over a post-rehearsal pint at her local microbrewery in the Roncesvalles neighbourhood. \u201cI was just, like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna go make some music and we\u2019ll defibrillate you if we need you. I\u2019m gonna go make this record and we\u2019ll see what it is and then maybe we\u2019ll take you off life support.\u2019 And then I was, like, \u2018No, no. I have to.\u2019 Because now Dragonette feels like mine.\u201d\n\nIt seems odd that Sorbara, 43, would be nervous about carrying Dragonette \u2014 which she formed with her ex-husband, Dan Kurtz, 15 years ago \u2014 ahead as a solo act since she began performing and recording as a solo act when she was just 16.\n\nBut once she and Kurtz decided, after making \u201cRoyal Blues\u201d together six years ago despite their recent separation, to part ways creatively, as well, it took her some time to claim the name and the legacy of Dragonette as her own. And also to realize that she was now in a position to do whatever she wanted with it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to wrap up shop. I was doing well just floating around the world writing with other people, doing collaborations,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d started writing for other artists, and I love collaborating and I love writing and I love releasing music. It was just the idea of having to put something that\u2019s just mine behind my name and being the only person in the picture.\u201d\n\nA series of encounters with potential label suitors didn\u2019t help her disenchantment, as A&R professionals offered Sorbara \u2014 whose done just fine penning top-shelf pop fodder in the past with the likes of Martin Solveig and Kaskade, as well as for other artists such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Keith Urban \u2014 guidance towards the future in the form of radio-ready playlists that really didn\u2019t sit comfortably with her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to diss what\u2019s on the radio but it just was, like, \u2018If I\u2019m supposed to try to get on the radio, I don\u2019t want to make music anymore,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018Music used to be better and now it sucks.\u2019 I just don\u2019t want to make that. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just not for me. Maybe I aged out of it. I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even like it was bad music. It was just, like, \u2018No, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 My soul just reacted in a way where I thought \u2018If that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do, maybe I\u2019m not a band anymore because I don\u2019t want to do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nA fortunate encounter with producer Dan Farber, who\u2019s worked with Lizzo and Dizzee Rascal in the past, during a \u201crandom\u201d writing trip to Los Angeles proved to be the catalyst for \u201cTwennies\u201d \u2014 even if it took Sorbara some time to wake up to that fact.\n\nOne of the first tunes the two wrote together was the sweet, bossa nova-tinged ballad \u201cThis Is All You Get,\u201d yet at the time of its creation Sorbara deemed it a bad fit for Dragonette. Yet as time moved on, it dawned on her that now that Dragonette was just her, Dragonette could sound like whatever the hell she wanted Dragonette to sound like. She could even re-embrace her \u201cinner Ani DiFranco\u201d and take the music in directions that hearken back to her formative years as a folk singer/songwriter. Farber was a willing co-conspirator.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so amazing. I\u2019ve worked with so many people over the last 10 years when I started just walking in with strangers or whatever,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never made a musical connection where all of a sudden you\u2019re speaking a creative language with such easy flow and there\u2019s no weird judginess and I\u2019m not going to censor anything and that was how it was from the very beginning. We wrote that song and I was, like, \u2018Too bad it\u2019s not Dragonette.\u2019 But with time and space and feeling like I could do whatever I want, it went from being \u2018I can do whatever I want. This has to be a Dragonette record and this is how I make this thing mine.\u2019 It was a thing I had to do to own the past 15 years of my life.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cTwennies\u201d thrown out to the world at large on Oct. 28, Dragonette returns to a Toronto stage on Thursday at the Axis Club. It\u2019s one of only a handful of gigs she\u2019s done since the last record, but the first \u2014 a trip to the Planet Pride celebrations in Brooklyn last summer which she almost cancelled at the last minute \u2014 gave her inner confirmation that she was capable of claiming Dragonette as her own.\n\nAfter performing the worldwide smash \u201cHello,\u201d a 2010 collaboration with DJ/producer Solveig that was back on the Billboard charts this year thanks to its inclusion in the TV series \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d before the Planet Pride crowd Sorbara wandered around and heard \u201cHello,\u201d her Kaskade cut \u201cFire In Your New Shoes\u201d and her Galantis co-write \u201cPeanut Butter Jelly\u201d being spun to delirious crowds by other DJs. It was a welcome boost of confidence.\n\n\u201cI wrote all these songs but I\u2019d never in my life allowed myself to feel that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like something happening outside of me and I couldn\u2019t take ownership of it and, for some reason, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because now Dragonette is me and it\u2019s mine I feel myself more holistically in this thing and I\u2019m like \u2018Wow, I did all those things.\u2019 And those songs are living on. \u2018Hello\u2019 was on the top of the f---ing Billboard charts this year. That\u2019s a f---ing classic.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point is not tooting my own horn or saying \u2018Look at all this sh--- I did,\u2019 but for the past 10 years I never took ownership of it. I just flew down there by myself. I had no entourage. I was a floater. And then I got up onstage and I sang for the first performance and something about the aloneness of me there, I think, made me realize all of a sudden \u2018Oh, I had to do this.\u2019 I woke up to my autonomy and my ownership of all this stuff and then I kept hearing my songs and all of a sudden I owned them and I was me.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/life/together/people/2021/01/17/at-home-with-chef-cory-vitiello-dragonette-singer-martina-sorbara-and-their-adorable-toddler-barlow.html", "page_content": "What\u2019s life in lockdown with a two-year-old like? \u201cThe greatest!\u201d says Martina Sorbara. \u201cWe\u2019re really fortunate,\u201d says her partner, chef Cory Vitiello, of life at home with Barlow, who turned two in September. \u201cWe just have so much time during this critical stage to spend with him and watch him grow and enjoy every step.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s busy schedules usually mean that they\u2019re anywhere but at their home, which is between High Park and Roncesvalles Village. All that changed with the lockdown in March 2020, when Dragonette, Sorbara\u2019s indie-pop project, was put on hold, and Vitiello, founder of elevated-takeout-rotisserie-chicken joint Flock Rotisserie + Greens, faced a wave of heartbreaking April cancellations, including Biblio Bash, the Toronto Public Library fundraiser with his catering partner 10Tation, and his annual fundraising dinner for children\u2019s cancer charity Camp Ooch at Cactus Club Caf\u00e9, where he is head of culinary development for Toronto.\n\nBut the silver lining has been the extra time at home with their son. Right now, Barlow is learning to talk (\u201cHe calls me \u2018hon\u2019 and \u2018babe,\u2019\u201d Sorbara says with a laugh), and he graduated early from potty training, which the couple initiated once they realized that their normally packed schedules had dramatically freed up.\n\nIt\u2019s created plenty of time for lazy Sundays. \u201cWe\u2019ve made Sundays about us,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so special. We lock ourselves in, do our crosswords and cook.\u201d On a typical weekend, the family will get up early and go for a stroll through High Park or Roncesvalles Village. They\u2019re regulars at the Roncy caf\u00e9 Reunion Island, sometimes scooping up a legendary breakfast sandwich from the Gold Standard takeout window. \u201cThey treat Barlow like a VIP,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nVitiello, a chef since he was 15, spent most Sundays during the first two decades of his 25-year career working hectic shifts in kitchens. After closing his acclaimed Harbord Room restaurant in 2016, his life changed. Now, in contrast to the harried pace of a restaurant kitchen, Vitiello savours the slower speed of cooking at home. He starts the day by picking up fresh ingredients from local merchants, such as fish market Hooked or Roncesvalles produce stand Ko Fruit Market.\n\nThough veggies and fish are usually the core ingredients of his mains, a high-quality cut of meat constitutes a special Sunday treat. Braised meats, especially short ribs, have been a favourite comfort food over the winter. While Sorbara is a pescatarian, Vitiello says he has \u201cno problem spending the whole Sunday cooking this braise that could feed 15 people, even though there is only one person in the house who eats it.\u201d Thankfully, it\u2019s not hard to find some outside assistance. \u201cI usually take some to the neighbours [as a] surprise,\u201d he says.\n\nSorbara is a whiz in the kitchen, too, whipping up pastries to satisfy Vitiello\u2019s sweet tooth. She\u2019s happiest, however, spending a cosy Sunday working away on a crossword, a pastime Vitiello has picked up as well, along with his Sudoku habit.\n\nSorbara is a veteran puzzle master \u2014 she enjoys making crosswords as birthday gifts for her father, York University chancellor Gregory Sorbara. A highlight of her 2020 was receiving a thoughtful rejection from the New York Times for a crossword she\u2019d submitted that had the theme of shape-shifting. \u201cI\u2019m going to submit another one, and I have high hopes!\u201d she says.\n\nTo carve out time for themselves, they take turns putting Barlow down for his nap and to bed at night. \u201cAnd our glory time is when we finally get him down to bed and we have our evening to ourselves,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nThat\u2019s when the strategy board games come out. Their current favourite is A Few Acres of Snow, an out-of-print two-player game from 2011 based on the struggle between the French and the British to occupy Canada. Sorbara learned the game from her cousin, a board-game collector. \u201cIt\u2019s hilariously nerdy,\u201d she says. Vitiello also juggles three ongoing poker groups on Zoom: a game with friends, a game with fellow chefs and a game with \u201cthe old-timers, Martina\u2019s father and his friends.\u201d\n\nBut the highlight remains watching their baby boy grow. \u201cIn the past year, I think we have seen three different versions of him and had to say goodbye to some really sweet versions only to [witness the] birth [of] the next incarnation of who this child is,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cIt\u2019s been so special to see that growth together.\u201d\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/martina-sorbara/", "page_content": "Martina Sorbara (born November 13, 1978) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and frontwoman of the band Dragonette.
