But even before he took the field for Carlton, Clover had to conquer the odds on the battlefields of France in World War 1. From Maryborough in central Victoria, Horrie enlisted in the 1st AIF in September 1915. After basic training, he embarked for France with reinforcements for the 7th Battalion in January of 1916. Soon pitched into the horrors of trench warfare, he fought and survived until September of that year, when he was transferred to a machine gun company and promoted to the rank of Corporal. On Christmas day, 1916, Horrie was struck down with acute appendicitis. He was evacuated to a field hospital for emergency surgery, where the doctors discovered that his appendix was gangrenous and that his life was in danger. He was immediately transferred to London for specialist treatment, and months of recuperation. Pronounced unfit for further front-line service, he was repatriated back to Australia in August 1917, and honourably discharged in May of the following year \u2013 six months before the Armistice. Having recovered, and keen to have a crack at senior football, Clover trained with Richmond and Melbourne before Carlton gave him an opportunity at VFL level. And how he delivered! In his first match in 1920 \u2013 ironically, against Richmond - he kicked four goals from centre half-forward, and hit the post three times! By the end of his first season at Princes Park, Clover was one of Carlton\u2019s drawcards. Former Australian Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies was just one of the many Carlton fans who were captivated; \u201che was the most artistic of high marks, unforgettable at half-forward,\u201d said Menzies. Horrie could kick a football, too. A balanced, deceptively quick mover, he was a glorious running drop-kick for goal. Playing against Richmond again at Princes Park in July, 1921, he let fly with a monster kick that was later measured at 86.26 metres \u2013 that\u2019s 94 yards, 2 feet in imperial terms! And there are numerous other instances where he roosted the ball more than 70 metres. In round 12 of 1921, he slotted 13 goals in a game against St Kilda; a club record which still stands today. The Blues made the finals in third place in 1921 and battled through to meet Richmond for the Premiership. Then the heavens above the MCG opened up on the day before the decider, turning the ground into a quagmire. In what was to be Clover\u2019s only Grand Final appearance, Richmond won a slogging, mauling contest by four points. While Premiership glory eluded him, Horrie was Carlton\u2019s top goalkicker in three of his first four seasons, including 1922, where his total of 58 was the competition\u2019s best. He was appointed captain of the Blues that same year, and in 1923 took on the dual role of captain-coach. Over 1924 / 1925, he suffered more debilitating illness that prevented him from playing all season. Unable to pull on his football boots, he took on the job of Club Secretary, and continued in that position even after returning to the field in 1926. When he did eventually resume, he formed a new, powerful Carlton forward set-up with a young Harry \u201cSoapy\u201d Vallence at full-forward. Twice more \u2013 in 1926 and 1928, Clover\u2019s brilliance and accuracy in front of goal saw him at the top of Carlton\u2019s goal-kicking, and in 1929 \u2013 aged 34, he was honoured with the captaincy of Victoria against WA in his ninth and final game in the Big Vee. show_image.php?id=205 Horrie Clover retired as a player in 1931 after 147 games. His total of 396 goals is still ranked fifth best in Carlton\u2019s proud history (only displaced for fourth when Brendan Fevola broke through in 2007/2008) \u2013 and it should be remembered that all but a handful of his games were played at centre half-forward, not in the goal square. In 1932 he was elected Vice-President of the Carlton Football Club, but retired after one year. In February 1935 on learning of Terry Ogden's the serious illness, Clover and Newton Chandler offered their services for a blood transfusion for the club's wing man. After a blood test Chandler's blood was accepted. However, Ogden passed away the next month. Clover stood again in 1935, was elected \u2013 and spent twenty unbroken years serving his beloved Blues. He even took on the Presidency in 1956, aged 60, and was as vigorous and determined as ever in his two years in the job. Carlton Football Club mourned deeply when Horrie Clover passed away on the first day of January, 1984. Three years later, he was among the first to be inducted into the Carlton Hall of Fame. Testament to his stature in the game as a whole, he was elected to the AFL Hall of Fame in 1996; and May 2000 saw him named as one of four emergencies in Carlton\u2019s Team of the Century. A champion in every sense of the word, he spent 37 years of his remarkable life at Princes Park. Footnote The Argus published an article on Maryborough, April 12 1930, it said; \"Clover has been the leading half-forward in League ranks for some time. It takes a specialist to fill the position capably, and the Carisbrook man does this admirably. Like good wine he has improved with age, and besides being one of the greatest half forwards that has ever appeared on a football field, he is about the best all round kicker that has ever played the game. He excells in punting, drop, and place kicking. He is a great marksman and a splendid exponent, one of the greatest the district has produced, besides being a fair cricketer also.\" When Clover returned to football in 1926, The Argus mentioned that they thought it was the first time a member of the Permit and Umpire Committee had played in a League game. 13 GOAL AWARD Round 12, 1921 At the Carlton AGM held on Monday 27 February 1922, Horrie Clover \"was presented with ball used on the occasion, the St.Kilda club having generously donated it to the Carlton officials, who had it mounted for the purpose.\" (Age February 22 1922) 1922 The Art Of Forward Play Horrie wrote an article for the Sporting Globe August 30 p7 To read click here> http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article184798404 1928 Idol of Carlton Crowds - Australia's Best Centre Half Forward The Sporting Globe's football writer W.

Although his outstanding on-field career was restricted to only 106 games by war service and a chronic thigh injury, he was a star defender in two Premiership teams, a club Best and Fairest, and the first Blue to win the game\u2019s highest individual honour; the Brownlow Medal.Later, he served as a committeeman, and a hard-working and effective club secretary, before his deeply-mourned passing at the age of just 51. But what made Bertrand John Deacon unique was not just his exploits on the field for his beloved Blues. He was a man of the highest principles; a true gentleman whose moral courage and sense of fair play set him apart.Bert was born into a footballing family at Northcote in 1922 . His father, Jack Deacon, was a prominent player for Preston in the 1920's who spent many years on the committee of the club when his playing days ended. After showing promise at schoolboy and junior level, Bert followed his father into the red and white colours of Preston\u2019s senior side in 1941 , while the devastation of World War II spread across the world. On May 11, 1940, the V.F.A. Recorder noted \"\"Bert Deacon, a l7-year-old lad, will be tried in the centre for Preston today. He has been doing well with the seconds.Deacon was in and out of the side that year and was omitted for Preston's one finals appearance, but played every game in 1941. By the start of the following season, the V.F.A. were in recess and players were free to cross to League clubs without a clearance.In a VFA competition deprived of quality and quantity by the eagerness of Australia\u2019s young men to fight for their country, 19 year-old Deacon played in all of Preston\u2019s home and away matches in that bleak year, only to be left out of the side for the finals. Port Melbourne won the flag, and soon afterwards the VFA announced that it was suspending its competition for the duration of the war.Bert himself enlisted soon after that, but while waiting for his call-up, went looking for a game somewhere else. When he called at Princes Park, recently-appointed Carlton coach Percy Bentley welcomed him in, and the pair began a partnership that would endure throughout Deacon\u2019s entire VFL career.Bert first took the field for Carlton against Footscray at the Yarraville Oval on Saturday, June 20, 1942 . The Western Oval had been appropriated by the government for use as a military transit centre, so the Bulldogs were bunking-in with their VFA neighbours. Bentley named Deacon in the centre, where he played alongside two men with whom he would later share Premiership glory; Vin Brown and Fred Fitzgibbon . On that day however, Footscray adapted to the conditions better than the Blues, and ran out winners by 19 points.Deacon managed just three games in 1942 , two in 1943 and three in 1944 , as his training and postings to Australia\u2019s far north kept him a long way from home. But by early 1945 , with the Axis forces in Europe all but beaten and the Japanese in full retreat in the Pacific, Lance Corporal Bert Deacon was transferred back to Melbourne, where he wasted no time in resuming his football career. In 1945, Deacon was captain-coach of an Army Stores team in Darwin that included several League and Association players, including Footscray legend, Charlie Sutton.He returned to Carlton\u2019s team in July, 1945 , for the match against Essendon at Princes Park. The Blues lost a cliff-hanger by three points, but by siren time that afternoon, coach Bentley knew that he had a potential champion in his team with Deacon at centre half-back. Although he was just 180 cm and 79 kg, Bert settled into defence like he was born to it. He was a strong and clever mark, beautifully balanced, with an uncanny ability to read the flight of the ball. And once he got it, he invariably disposed of it well with a neat drop kick to position.Carlton\u2019s feat of battling through to a finals berth in 1945 , and then going on to beat South Melbourne in the most infamous and controversial Grand Final of all time, has been well documented. What isn\u2019t so well-known is that the Carlton-Collingwood Preliminary Final that preceded it was every bit as violent, and surely was a catalyst for later events.After losing the second Semi Final to minor Premiers South Melbourne, Collingwood went into the Preliminary Final with the intention of knocking some of Carlton\u2019s playmakers off their game. Included among their targets were key defenders Deacon and full-back Vin Brown . The game was an ugly series of melees from early on, as Collingwood went head hunting, and Carlton fought fire with fire. Yet through it all, as fists, elbows and even boots flew around him, it was Deacon who held the line across half-back. Despite being niggled, punched and thrown to the ground late on many occasions, he never once retaliated, nor complained to the umpire. Cool and collected, he just simply kept getting the ball, and sending it into attack.Even so, Collingwood held sway on the scoreboard for three quarters, and seemed to have sealed the match early in the last term, when they kicked their twelfth goal and stretched their lead to 45 points. But when Vin Brown was king-hit by Collingwood\u2019s Len Hustler, and the Blues would take no more. Galvanised by that incident, they came storming back into the match to pile on seven goals in the last 18 minutes, and beat the demoralised Magpies by ten points.The following week, when South Melbourne and Carlton met to decide the 1945 VFL Premiership , the teams ran out onto a Princes Park packed to the rafters with almost 63,000 spectators. The occasion, and simmering tensions on both sides - heightened by the violence of the previous Saturday, produced a powder keg of emotion that inevitably exploded into another vicious clash forever remembered as the \u2018Bloodbath\u2019 Grand Final.Once more, Bert Deacon was one of the few players from either side who was more interested in finding the football than punching on. In the second quarter, as the game degenerated into a series of running brawls, South\u2019s promising youngster Ron Clegg (like Deacon, a future Brownlow Medallist) was about to join in the fighting when Deacon took hold of his shoulder and quietly said; \u2018Don\u2019t go down there, son, there\u2019s nothing for you in that.\u2019 Clegg heeded Deacon\u2019s advice, only to be felled himself later in the match, by Carlton\u2019s fearsome captain, Bob Chitty As a groggy Clegg got to his feet to take his free kick, Deacon realised that Clegg was facing the wrong way, and turned him in the right direction \u2013 an action that infuriated Chitty, who snarled; \u2018I don\u2019t knock them down for you to pick up.\u2019 Carlton eventually won the battle by 28 points. Ten players were reported and suspended, yet one of the enduring stories of that bitter-sweet triumph for Carlton was the unflagging sportsmanship of Bert Deacon.Two years later, Deacon\u2019s career peaked when he won his second VFL Premiership medallion, topped off by the 1947 Brownlow Medal, and a tie for first place in Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest award. The year began with the arrival of brilliant West Australian Ern Henfry , who had stood out of football for a year to win a clearance to Carlton, and was appointed captain of the Blues after just two senior games.A gifted centreman and an inspirational leader, Henfry led a solid Carlton combination to the minor Premiership, on the way, striking up a strong rapport with his vice-captain Deacon. By then, Bert was considered as the outstanding centre half-back of the competition. In the week prior to the first round of the finals, he confirmed his standing in the game by becoming the first Carlton player to win the Brownlow Medal, when he polled 23 votes to beat St Kilda\u2019s Harry Bray by two.It would have been understandable had Deacon been distracted by the celebrations, but as always, he quickly refocused on the job at hand. Carlton met Essendon in the \u201947 Grand Final in front of 85,000 at the MCG, and seemed headed for defeat when they trailed by five points as the time-keeper\u2019s clock clicked into the last minute of time-on. That\u2019s when nuggety rover Fred Stafford (who had been rarely sighted all day) swooped on a spillage 30 metres out from goal and snapped truly, giving Carlton our second flag in three years by the narrowest possible margin.In the following week, amid the euphoria of Premiership celebrations, Deacon rounded off that one special season when he and Henfry were announced as joint winners of Carlton\u2019s Best and Fairest trophy. Earlier, Bert had also worn the Victorian state guernsey at the 1947 National Championships, winning the K.G. Luke Trophy for the best Victorian player in the series, as well as a number of newspaper awards.Deacon\u2019s third Grand Final appearance came in 1949 , and again Carlton\u2019s opponent was Essendon \u2013 who battled their way into the flag decider largely due to the form of their star full-forward, John Coleman. Adding to the interest in a match between the Premiers of the previous two years, Coleman needed six goals to reach the magical 100 for the season, and Essendon were determined to give him every possible chance to get them.After an even, hard-fought first quarter, Essendon proved unstoppable and steadily increased their advantage over the Blues. By the last change, the margin had blown out to 57 points \u2013 but remarkably, Coleman had been held to just two goals by Carlton\u2019s close-checking full-back Ollie Grieve - and Deacon, who ranged across half back and cut off many attacks with strong marks.However, with the game won, Essendon concentrated on getting the ball to Coleman, and with just minutes remaining he ran on to a short pass and lined up for a shot at number 100. It was then that Deacon \u2013 ever the gentleman \u2013 trotted up beside the young star, put a hand on his shoulder and offered a word or two of advice. As he turned and walked away, Coleman sent the ball between the posts.That was to be Bert\u2019s last shot at Premiership glory with the Blues. A persistent muscle tear in one thigh had begun to trouble him, and in 1950 restricted him to just seven games. He saddled up again in 1951 , but by mid-year admitted that he was struggling and decided to call time on a memorable career. He played his last match against the old foe; South Melbourne, at the Lake Oval in round 11, 1951 . The Blueboys did the right thing by their champion, and farewelled him with a tenacious, thrilling 5-point win.In 1952 Bert returned to Preston as captain-coach for two seasons, before hanging up his boots to continue his role off-field. In his three further years, Deacon is reported to have played in every position on the ground except full-back, a position held firm by another Preston legend in Ted Henrys. In 1955, Deacon acted as non-playing coach before finally retiring from an active role. In 1955 , the Bullants made the VFA finals for the first time since Deacon had last played for them in 1941 . While at Preston, he retained his links at Carlton, and by 1958 was back at Princes Park in a variety of administrative roles. Later, he was elected to the committee, and in 1970 became club Secretary under President George Harris . Two more flags followed - in 1970 and 1972 - and no-one at Carlton was prouder than Bert Deacon.On January 3, 1974, Bert and his family were holidaying at Balnarring on the Mornington Peninsula, when he suffered a massive heart attack, and died before reaching hospital. He was just 51 years old. The football world was rocked to its core by the news, and there was widespread grief at the loss of one of football\u2019s favourite sons \u2013 a man whose dignity and integrity transcended club loyalties and brought him genuine admiration. Winning and losing mattered much to Bert Deacon, but so did how the game was played.The Deacon family tradition continued at Preston with his brother Bill acting as President from 1983 to 1987, a period that saw the club become the first in V.F.A. history to take out premierships at the Firsts, Seconds and Thirds levels in 1983 and again the following year.

He is remembered for being Carlton's first ever Brownlow Medal winner.\n\nA centre half back, Deacon began his league career in 1942. He was a premiership player for Carlton in 1945 (after acting as captain-coach of an Army stores team that won all ten games in a services competition in Darwin) and 1947, the latter in a year which he won both a Brownlow Medal and shared Carlton's best and fairest medal with his captain Ern Henfry. The previous season Deacon had finished fourth in the Brownlow Medal count but this time around finished on top, thus becoming Carlton's inaugural winner of the award.\n\nDeacon left Carlton after the 1951 season and became captain-coach for Preston in the Victorian Football Association (VFA), the club where he had played for prior to being recruited by Carlton. He later served as Carlton vice-president and club secretary.\n\nHe is the centre half back in Carlton's official 'Team of the Century'.\n\nOff the field, Deacon worked for many years for long-serving VFL and Carlton president Sir Kenneth Luke. Bertram Deacon died of a heart attack on 3 January 1974 while on holiday at Balnarring. Deacon was just 51 years of age and died despite the desperate efforts of his Preston team-mate, Pat Foley to revive him."}, {"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/712053/moment-24-deacons-brownlow-medal", "page_content": "24. 1947 - Bert Deacon's Brownlow Medal\n\nVIEW THE 25 GREATEST MOMENTS HUB HERE\n\nThe man who would be Carlton\u2019s first Brownlow Medallist deftly adjusted the dial of his trusty bakelite radio. Flicking the knob with those long fingers famously used for plucking the pigskin of a Saturday afternoon, Bert Deacon pierced the crackle when he found station 3DB.It was early on the evening of Wednesday, September 3, 1947, and Bert and his dear wife, Jean, having already kissed goodnight to their baby boy Brian, pulled up a couple of armchairs at their modest home in Preston\u2019s Hawker Avenue. There they lent a collective ear to the station\u2019s broadcast of what would prove an historic medal count.As the votes were being cast, Deacon fully anticipated Richmond\u2019s Bill Morris to emerge with the gong ... not that he and his better half particularly cared. \u201cBert hadn\u2019t thought about the Brownlow Medal and I didn\u2019t even know what a Brownlow Medal was. I was a country bumpkin,\u201d said Jean, in an interview with this reporter a few months prior to her death in August 2009.\u201cWe had some friends, Jack Costello and his girlfriend Carol, who ran the Preston Hotel in High Street, who also came around to listen. When Bert\u2019s name was announced the visitors went out to their car and returned with beer and sandwiches, and by the time reporters turned up there was a beer and sandwich waiting. The other thing I remember that night was that Bert\u2019s brother-in-law (former St Kilda footballer William Maslen), who lived in Coburg at the time, rode his bike across to shake hands with him.\u201dWith votes awarded by field umpires on a basis of three for first preference, two for second and one for third, Deacon accrued four first preferences, three seconds and five thirds to emerge the victor with 23 votes. He overhauled St Kilda\u2019s Harold Bray by two votes.As The Herald\u2019s famed football writer Alf Brown declared. \u201cGreat consistency \u2013 he was awarded votes in 12 out of 18 games \u2013 helped Deacon to win the trophy. He scored four first votes and was equal first with Bill Morris (Richmond) after the first votes had been counted. With three seconds he crept to second place after the second votes had been counted \u2013 Bray led 21 to 18 \u2013 and with five third votes he won the medal from Bray, who did not score a point when the third votes were counted,\u201d Brown wrote.The record books show that Deacon represented Carlton in 106 senior matches from 1942 through to 1949, including the famous \u201cBloodbath\u201d Grand Final against South Melbourne in 1945 and the last gasp Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947. He also represented the Big V in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949 and was barely 50 matches into his senior career when he won the coveted Brownlow.The late Jim Clark, one of the last surviving members of the premiership teams of which Deacon was such an integral part, was recently asked to declare the best Carlton footballer he ever played alongside. \u201cOh easy,\u201d came the reply. \u201cBerty Deacon ... class .... one of the greatest ever. He was a Preston boy, married a girl from Kerang, and Bert and I were great cobbers. I got my first break with the seniors in 1943 and had the privilege of playing alongside him. He was not only a great footballer, but a bonza feller and a real gentleman. There will never be a better footballer, in my opinion, than Berty Deacon.\u201cBerty was around six foot and a half (184cm) but he had such long fingers he rarely dropped a mark, and he was a pro runner too \u2013 nearly every footy club had two or three pro-runners. He won the Brownlow Medal in \u201947 \u2013 a premiership year \u2013 and to win the Brownlow in a premiership year would have to be a prestigious Brownlow because a premiership team would have a lot of other chappies taking votes. But Berty had such superiority and he was as fair as fair as fair.\u201dIt says something of the character of the man that barely 24 hours after his famous Brownlow win, Deacon and Ken Luke paid an impromptu visit to Deacon\u2019s teammate Ron Hines, who was convalescing in Heidelberg hospital. A photograph which later appeared in The Herald shows Hines congratulating Deacon on his win with a handshake, as Ken Luke proudly watches on.The great Horrie Clover echoed the sentiments of all at Princes Park, who saw Deacon as a worthy recipient of the precious medal. \u201cI am very delighted that a Carlton player should at long last win the medal,\u201d Clover told a reporter from The Sun. \u201cWithout fear of contradiction I can say Bert Deacon is a great player and a great chap.\u201dObjective observers such as Alf Brown also concurred. \u201cFootball followers will applaud the selection of Bert Deacon as the winner of this year\u2019s award. He is one of the most brilliant players in the game \u2013 a sure, spectacular mark, a fast and clever ground player, and a defender whose courageous clearing dashes often put his side into attack,\u201d Brown wrote. \u201cDeacon, who is vice-captain of Carlton, is the best mark of a wet ball I have seen. He has remarkably big hands and this, undoubtedly, accounts for his ability to take spectacular finger-tip marks with either a greasy or dry ball.\u201cThe field umpires\u2019 votes for the Medal show that they have placed great emphasis on fairness as well as on ability. Deacon is scrupulously fair . . . \u201dBert Deacon was tragically lost to the football world when, on January 3, 1974, he suffered a fatal heart attack. Though only 51, the boy from the northern suburbs had dedicated 34 years to his beloved Blues.On New Year\u2019s Eve, 1991, Deacon\u2019s famous medal was stolen from his widow\u2019s purse during a house break-in. Thankfully, Jean received a replacement medal, struck when then-chief executive commissioner of the AFL the late Alan Schwab heard of her plight."}, {"url": "https://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/1018168/images-emerge-of-blues-first-brownlow-medallist", "page_content": "A SEQUENCE of four photographs of Carlton\u2019s inaugural Brownlow Medallist Bert Deacon in full flight have surfaced almost three quarters of a century after the much-admired centre half-back earned the game\u2019s most coveted award.\n\nCaptured in an unknown suburban parkland, the photos show Deacon in his long-sleeved Dark Navy guernsey (possibly carrying the original No.14 on the back) and highcuts, magnificently executing the game\u2019s basics \u2013the high mark, the field kick and the art of \u201cselling the candy\u201d.\n\nThe images, which do not carry a photographer\u2019s name, were stored in a box of miscellaneous football images in the keep of Peter Valentino, a former volunteer at the State Library of Victoria, who graciously availed copies to the Club.\n\nPeter believed the photographs were captured for the national magazine Sporting Life (published from 1947 to 1957) and the Australian pictorial magazine Pix (published from 1938 to 1972).\n\nThey are thought to have been taken in 1948 - the year after Deacon, with 23 votes, earned the Brownlow by two from St Kilda centreman Harold Bray.\n\nTo complete his stellar year, Deacon also featured in Carlton\u2019s famed one-point Grand Final victory over Essendon in \u201947 and tied with the then Carlton captain Ern Henfry for the club\u2019s Best & Fairest award.\n\nHenfry also featured on the front cover of the May 1951 edition of Sporting Life, a copy of which Peter also supplied.\n\nBoth Henfry and Deacon featured in Sporting Life\u2019s Teams of The Year (a forerunner to All-Australian teams) \u2013 Henfry in 1947 and \u201949; Deacon in 1947, \u201948 and \u201949."}]}
