She took silver in her first race of the Games, and then missed out on medaling in the 200 meter freestyle.\n\nAfter the race, she talked about the immense pressure she feels to meet the sky-high expectations on her \u2014 and the pressure she places on herself. Other stars such as Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka are opening up about the difficulties of being in the spotlight.\n\n\"I am always striving to be my best and to be better than I've ever been, and it's not easy when your times are world records in some events,\" Ledecky told reporters after her race.

Ledecky did not make it to the podium in that race, placing fifth. For the first time in her Olympic career, she did not win a medal.\n\n\"I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me, or feel like silver or any other medal besides gold is a disappointment or anything.

She crushed the mark of 3:58.37 that she set nearly two years ago on the Gold Coast of Australia, and had been chasing ever since.\n\n\"I was pumped,\" Ledecky said. \"That's what I wanted and I had been so close to breaking that all year, the past two years. I knew I was due for a breakthrough.\"\n\nIt was a night of world records at the Olympic Aquatics Center.

It never really gets old,\" Ledecky said of her run of records. \"I have some long-term goals. We're not quite there yet, but we'll get there.\"\n\nIt was her fourth gold medal of the meet, following her titles in the 200, 800 and the 4x200-meter relay.\n\nPersistent rain has overshadowed the meet since the opening day but it wasn't raining Saturday night during the 400 -- not that it would have bothered Ledecky.\n\n\"It was beautiful out there tonight. I'm not really affected by the rain or anything,\" she said. \"There's no rain under water, so it doesn't really bother me.\"\n\nLedecky won the 800 meters at the London Olympics and added gold medals in the 400, 800 and 1,500 at last year's world championships, where she also lowered the world records over the two longer distance events.\n\nHer swim on Saturday gave her another first -- for a world record in the new pool that will be used for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"Oh yeah, I didn't even think about that. I guess that is pretty neat,\" she said. \"It's a nice pool. I'm loving it here in Australia -- it's been a fun week.\""}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/olympics/swimming/story/_/id/11332987/", "page_content": "IRVINE, Calif. -- Katie Ledecky broke the world record in the 400-meter freestyle at the U.S. national championships Saturday night, impressing a downtrodden Michael Phelps, who lost for the third time this week.\n\nLedecky, a 17-year-old from Bethesda, Maryland, won in 3 minutes, 58.86 seconds, becoming the first woman since Janet Evans to hold world marks in the 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyles at the same time.\n\n\"That is some serious speed,\" marveled Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history.\n\nKatie Ledecky, 17, is the first woman since Janet Evans to own world marks in the 400, 800 and 1,500 freestyles at the same time.

Terrill\n\nLedecky bettered the old mark of 3:59.15 set by Italy's Federica Pellegrini at the 2009 world championships in Rome, when a raft of records were broken during the apex of the high-tech suit era. Those suits were banned the following year, making world records harder to achieve.\n\nPhelps had another bummer of a night, finishing sixth in the 100 backstroke behind Olympic champion Matt Grevers, who won in 52.75 seconds.\n\nPhelps was seventh at the turn and touched in 53.95.\n\n\"I hate this,\" he groused. \"Anything to be able to change this.\"\n\nPhelps' only good bit of news was that he officially qualified to swim in the Pan Pacific Championships this month in Australia by virtue of his earlier second-place finish in the 100 butterfly. He was seventh in the 100 free, having launched his comeback four months ago.\n\n\"I'm not going to use the excuse of taking off a year and a half to two years,\" he said. \"When there are workouts I need to be at every one and that's the bottom line.\"\n\nLedecky's hard work was evident.\n\nShe went under world-record pace the entire race, dropping a whopping 1.71 seconds under at 250 meters. With one lap to go, she was still 1.53 seconds under.\n\n\"Just tried to make sure I didn't rush the first 100,\" she said. \"It was probably pretty close to perfect.\"\n\nAfter hitting the wall, the normally reserved Ledecky pounded the water and smiled broadly as the crowd cheered.\n\nLedecky swam the third-fastest time ever in the morning preliminaries, clocking 3:59.82.\n\n\"I thought it was going to be really tough to get under four minutes twice,\" Phelps said. \"It's good seeing somebody who's hungry and somebody who wants it like her. She puts it all out there and she does the work.\"\n\nAs he walked off, the 29-year-old Phelps joked, \"Old man gets more tired easily.\"\n\nBruce Gemmell, Ledecky's coach, said, \"He probably forgot that when he was 17 years old he could do the same thing.\"\n\nLedecky joined Pellegrini as the only women to break 4 minutes in the event, with the American dipping under that barrier three times now.\n\n\"It was on my mind, but I didn't let it overtake me today and I think that's something that definitely helped,\" Ledecky said. \"I was very relaxed.\"\n\nEvans owned all three women's distance freestyle world records from 1988 to 2006.\n\n\"It means a lot. It's an honor to be mentioned in the same sentence as Janet,\" Ledecky said. \"She's a great person and a really great role model for all U.S. distance swimmers.\"\n\nLedecky lowered her own world marks in the 800 and 1,500 freestyles three days apart in June at a meet in Texas. The Olympic 800 free champion has amazing versatility, with the ability to swim distances ranging from 200 to 1,500 meters.\n\nIt was Ledecky's third win of the meet, having earlier claimed the 200 and 800 freestyles. She earned the chance to swim all three events at Pan Pacs. She will be a high school senior this fall, and later plans to attend Stanford.\n\nCierra Runge finished second in 4:04.67, and Leah Smith was third at 4:06.28.\n\nMichael McBroom won the men's 400 free in 3:47.19. He was in the ready room awaiting his final when Ledecky electrified the crowd.\n\n\"We were talking in there, `Oh man, she might beat some of us,\" he said.\n\nMissy Franklin powered through the final lap to win the 100 backstroke in 59.38, the world's third-fastest time. She was the only woman to break 1 minute in the race and added her third title of the meet.\n\n\"I knew the rest of the field was going to be out really fast, so I knew I had to bring it home strong,\" she said.\n\nRachel Bootsma was second at 1:00.71 and Elizabeth Pelton took third in 1:00.76, giving California swimmers a sweep of the top three spots.\n\nOlympians Jessica Hardy and Micah Lawrence tied for first in the 100 breaststroke at 1:06.51, sixth-quickest in the world this year. Hardy earlier won the non-Olympic 50 breast event, in which Lawrence was third, and Lawrence took the 200 breast title.\n\nCody Miller earned a trip Down Under by winning the men's 100 breast in 59.91, the only man to break 1 minute in the final. His time tied for ninth-quickest in the world."}]}
