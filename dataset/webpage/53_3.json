He opened his first shop in 1969, joining forces with the master cutter Edward Sexton, and backed by Cilla Black and the Beatles executive Peter Brown.\n\nThe shop attracted rock stars and aristocrats who wanted the mix of innovative styling and traditional made-to-measure tailoring. Huge lapels, velvet jackets with nipped-in waists, Oxford bags and mixed-up tweeds fast became his design signatures.\n\nHighlights from the exhibition, Tommy Nutter: Rebel on the Row, include four of Mick Jagger's suits \u2013 boyish-sized save for the shoulders \u2013 in shades of green and lemon. Elton John's stadium-ready two-tone dinner jackets are striking and tasteless in equal measure.\n\n\"Tommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible,\" said Elton John, who often visited the shop to be measured up while drinking a glass of sherry.\n\nIn the early 70s Nutter created suits for Bianca Jagger. \"Bianca really wanted a man's suit and not a suit cut for a woman,\" Everest said. \"She asked for the darts to be taken out of her first pistachio green suit to make it sexier.\"\n\nThe exhibition has recreated Nutter's shop, along with its innovative window displays featuring patchouli-soaked stuffed rats wearing diamond chokers, to demonstrate how pioneering his approach to brand image was at the time.\n\nThe tailor stopped working with Sexton at 35a Savile Row in 1976 but returned to the street some years later to set up business again, at No 19. He died aged 49 in 1992."}, {"url": "https://www.douban.com/note/742710585/", "page_content": "WICKS ORDER|\u88c1\u7f1d\u754c\u6700\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u5c1a\u6559\u7236TOMMY NUTTER\n\n\u88c1\u7f1d\u754c\u6700\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u5c1a\u6559\u7236Tommy Nutter\n\n\u5728Tommy Nutter\uff081970\uff09\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5f7b\u5e95\u4ee3\u66ff\u4e86\u88c1\u7f1d\u65f6\u5c1a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8428\u7ef4\u5c14\u8857\u6700\u9876\u5c16\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u3002\n\nTommy Nutter was a British tailor.\n\nTommy Nutter was born in 1943.\n\nIn his youth Nutter studied at the Tailor and Cutter Academy and worked for traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward.

essentially conservative proposition, a suit of armor and the bedrock of a gentleman\u2019s wardrobe, but distinctly not a fashionable item. A Savile Row suit \u201crarely looks new in the conventional sense,\u201d the Australian journalist Lance Richardson writes in his new history of Tommy Nutter (and his brother, David), \u201cHouse of Nutter.\u201d Its magic, he goes on, \u201cis that it enhances your real self into heightened fantasy, then presents this fantasy as your real self.\u201d\n\nNutter brought a substantial dose of fantasy to the fantasy. He began on Savile Row at the lowest levels, picking up pins at G. Ward & Company, where he eventually joined forces with a talented young cutter named Edward Sexton and, with him, opened Nutters in 1969 \u2014 the first new tailor on Savile Row in more than a century. His investors included Peter Brown, a manager of the Beatles (he stepped in when his friend and former boss Brian Epstein died), and the pop star Cilla Black.\n\nImage\n\nNutter was already a fixture on the London scene, well connected via Brown, his boyfriend for a time. The Nutters suit, unlike others on the Row, was cut for flash: tight-waisted and small-chested to emphasize the body, with a long jacket and mega lapels. Fabrics and colors were chosen to stand out rather than stand back. Men and women both flocked in: Bianca as well as Mick, Diana Ross, Eric Clapton, Twiggy, Peter Sellers. Elton John, who first came to Nutters in 1971, ordered in bulk.\n\n\u201cHouse of Nutter\u201d traces the ascent and untimely end of Tommy Nutter, and the parallel history of his brother, David: also gay, also embedded in the world of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, though as a photographer and confidant. Tommy bloomed out of London\u2019s Swinging Sixties and became an internationally recognized designer, a celebrity in his own right.

He soon became inspired by changes in popular culture of the 1960s. In 1969 he opened his own shop, House of Nutter, in Savile Row, London. He worked with Edward Sexton, and was backed financially by Cilla Black and Peter Brown of the Beatles' company Apple He even created clothes for another fashion designer, Hardy Amies.\n\nIn the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan.\n\nNutter's suits are worn by three of the members of the Beatles on the famous cover of the Abbey Road album. He also created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.\n\nNutter died in 1992 of complications from AIDS."}, {"url": "https://savilerow-style.com/news/tommy-nutter-rebel-cause/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter, the tailor who ripped up the rules of Savile Row, is remembered in a new biography. Tom Corby reports\n\nJust over a quarter of a century after his untimely death from Aids, the avant-garde Tommy Nutter, like so many creatives of his generation, is still regarded as a legend, remembered as the tailor who single-handedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row with the male peacock revolution of 1960s swinging London. His contribution to some of the most iconic styles and pop imagery of the 20th century has become part of the history of his trade as he wore down the division between tailoring and fashion. Friends say that a statue ought to be put up of him, like that of Beau Brummel, the archetypal dandy who, in the 18th century, set the bespoke style for generations.\n\nTommy spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father owned a caf\u00e9, catering, in the main, to customers like truck drivers, gas fitters and builders. He was destined to be a plumber but, over the years, emerged as a blue collar boy made good in the class crucible of the 60s; a time when the alchemy of taste, cool, and sheer force of personality could transform lives in ways that would have seemed impossible in years gone by. Tommy, a 6ft 2 inches tall young man with matinee idol looks, arrived right on cue. It all started when, aged 19, he broke free from plumbing to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. He then landed an apprenticeship with Donaldson, Williamson and Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors, with premises in Burlington Arcade. There, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentlemen\u2019s classic wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thorough knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its hierarchy.\n\nIn 1969, Tommy founded his own business, joining up with Edward Sexton, a young cutter with brilliant technical skills. They were financially backed by Tommy\u2019s close friend, the singer Cilla Black, her husband Bobby Willis and others prepared to take a risk. The venture was an immediate success although a writer in the Daily Mirror snarked: \u201cThomas Nutter is opening what he calls a \u2018thoroughly square\u2019 tailoring shop \u2026 in Savile Row next week. Well that will make a change. I mean there can\u2019t be more than a dozen there now. Mr Nutter, who is 26, is weary of \u2018all those Carnaby Street gimmicks\u2019, and thinks that clothes, like hair, are settling down to something more sober \u2026 What, then, of rumours that Ringo Starr has ordered a pair of scarlet PVC trousers from Nutters?\u201d Tommy replied curtly: \u201cThey\u2019ll be very square scarlet PVC trousers.\u201d\n\nSavile Row, with its collection of Royal Warrants, had never seen anything like it when Nutters opened at No. 35a, the story of which has been brought back to life by Lance Richardson in his biography House of Nutter \u2013 The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row. A year on, the Daily Mail was declaring it \u201ca whizz bang success \u2013 the place for men\u2019s clothes\u201d, putting the charismatic Tommy in the class of actor Terence Stamp, photographer Brian Duffy, and hair dresser Vidal Sassoon, all the stylish young Londoners who had shot themselves into the new aristocracy. Clients came in from the hipper haunts of those named in Debrett\u2019s, from the media, pop stars and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End, whose ambition was to own a Nutter suit, drawn to Tommy not only because of his matchless sense of style, but also because of his personality. He welcomed them all.\n\nLike Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy who dressed The Queen, Tommy produced lively, contemporary tailoring, but with roots deeply embedded in the craftsmanship of Savile Row. Amies named Tommy as \u201cthe most exciting tailor on Savile Row in decades.\u201d For three decades, Tommy kitted out the biggest stars on both sides of the Atlantic. He was proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album, three of them wore Tommy Nutter bespoke. George Harrison chose\n\ndenim. Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong, then director of the National Portrait Gallery, Mick Jagger and Elton John. Andrew Lloyd Webber was also a client as well as a friend. He has recalled: \u201cThere was a wonderful maroon coat I wore for Ascot \u2013 he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on \u2013 Tommy made clothes for Tim Rice too \u2013 we were all great mates.\u201d\n\nMick Jagger sported an eau-de-nil three-piece for his wedding to Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971. He was in another Nutter creation days later on his honeymoon in Venice, fitted so snugly that it left no doubt as to which side he dressed. Celebrity nuptials became something of a thing for Tommy. John Lennon wore cream corduroy for his wedding to Yoko Ono on Gibraltar. For Elton John\u2019s marriage in 1984 Tommy made 20 suits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of mishap\u201d, as he later recalled, \u201cin a wide range of primary colours, including orange and very bright yellow. With each outfit went the appropriate straw boater.\u201d\n\nJohn Reid, Elton John\u2019s manager, has said: \u201cIt was quite an event going to Nutters. You\u2019d write the whole day off. Maybe you\u2019d have lunch and a couple of bottles of champagne.\u201d Tommy has said that when things became \u201cedgy\u201d with Elton he would send out for a bottle of sherry \u201cto smooth things along\u201d. For Elton\u2019s 36th birthday, Tommy made a suit overlaid with 1,009,444 bugle beads, each one painstakingly attached by hand. Tommy also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London, like the red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early 70s.\n\nPeople were attracted to Tommy not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but because of his ironic personality. He was a humorist with a wide and interesting circle of friends who were attracted by his enthusiasm, his gentle self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression, \u201cBut who am I to talk?\u201d He was a witty correspondent and his letters to his friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in London\u2019s Green Park.\n\nTommy died of Aids in August 1992, aged 49. \u201cThe saddest thing of all,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cis an in-between look.\u201d No-one could ever have accused him of that. At his memorial service in St George\u2019s, Hanover Square, just up the road from Savile Row, Cilla Black read an abridged excerpt from Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, relating the story of \u201cA true, a perfect gentle Knight \u2026 In dying in his excellence and flower, when he is certain of his high good name; for then he gives to friend, and self, no shame.\u201d\n\nThe final words should go to Nutters loyalist Elton John who said: \u201cTommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that\u2026\n\nHouse of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row by Lance Richardson, published by Chatto & Windus. \u00a325"}, {"url": "https://edinburghtailoringcompany.com/2023/05/29/who-are-tommy-nutter-and-edward-sexton-and-why-are-they-important/", "page_content": "Edward Sexton and Tommy Nutter are two of the most iconic names in Savile Row tailoring.

He has also been featured on television shows such as BBC\u2019s The Clothes Show and Channel 4\u2019s How to Look Good Naked.\n\nSexton\u2019s work is truly remarkable, and he is considered to be one of the best tailors in the world. If you are looking for a tailor who can help you to create a truly individual look, then Edward Sexton is the man for you.\n\nTommy Nutter \u2013 The Rockstar Tailor\n\nTommy Nutter was nothing short of a rockstar tailor. He was the son of a Chinese laundryman who arrived in London in the 1950s and found work as a tailor\u2019s apprentice. Nutter quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the most sought-after bespoke tailors in London. His clients included everyone from the Rolling Stones and the Beatles to the royal family.\n\nNutter was known for his flamboyant style and his willingness to take risks. He was the first tailor to put his name on the label of his suits, and he was also the first to use unusual materials like leather and denim. His bold style helped to redefine menswear in the 1960s and 1970s, and his influence can still be seen today.\n\nHe was the youngest of three brothers and began his career working in his father\u2019s tailor shop. In 1966, Nutter moved to New York City and began working as a personal assistant to the Hollywood film producer David O. Selznick. After a few years in New York, Nutter returned to London and opened his own tailor shop on Savile Row. He quickly gained a reputation for his unique style and became known as the \u201cRockstar tailor.\u201d Nutter\u2019s clients included some of the biggest names in the music and fashion industries, such as The Beatles, Mick Jagger, and Twiggy.\n\nNutter\u2019s career came to an abrupt end in 1992 when he died of a heart attack at the age of 49. However, his legacy lives on through his masterpieces.\n\nHow these two came together\n\nWhen two of the most renowned tailors in the world come together, the result is bound to be special. In 1969, two young tailors from Savile Row, Tommy Nutter, and Edward Sexton, joined forces to open a bespoke tailoring business on London\u2019s iconic Bruton Street. Their goal was to create the best tailor-made suits in the world, and they quickly became known for their exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail.\n\nNutter, who was previously employed by the world-famous Savile Row tailor house Hardy Amies, brought his expert eye for detail and an appreciation for traditional craftsmanship to the partnership. Sexton, on the other hand, was known for his more modern approach to tailoring, which included shorter jacket lengths and bolder colour choices. The combination of Nutter and Sexton\u2019s talents resulted in some of the most iconic looks of the late 20th century. They were responsible for dressing some of the most famous names in the world, including the Beatles.\n\nNutter and Sexton\u2019s designs were sharp and modern, yet still classic and timeless. They were the perfect combination of form and function, and they quickly became the go-to tailors for some of the most famous names in the world. From the Rolling Stones to the Beatles, everyone who was anyone wanted a Nutter or Sexton suit.\n\nNutter and Sexton worked together for over a decade, creating some of the most iconic suits of the 1970s. Sadly, their partnership came to an end in 1980, when Nutter passed away. However, their legacy lives on, and their work continues to inspire fellow tailors and fashion lovers alike, including yours truly here at Edinburgh Tailoring Company.\n\nTheir Legacy and Influence on Fashion\n\nTommy Nutter and Edward Sexton were two of the most influential figures in the world of fashion in the 20th century. As Savile Row tailors, they revolutionized the way men dressed, and their influence can still be seen today. Tommy Nutter was known for his sharp, clean-cut suits, while Edward Sexton was known for his more reckless and experimental style. They were responsible for modernizing the look of Savile Row and helping to make it the world-renowned destination for bespoke menswear that it is today. While their style was very different from one another, both Nutter and Sexton had a profound impact on fashion. Their work helped to make Savile Row the go-to place for stylish and well-made clothing.\n\nBoth men left a lasting legacy in the world of fashion, and their influence can still be seen today. If you\u2019re a fan of Savile Row tailoring, then you owe a debt of gratitude to Tommy Nutter and Edward Sexton.\n\nHow do I get the look?\n\nSavile Row tailors Tommy Nutter and Edward Sexton revolutionized menswear in the 1960s and 1970s. By breaking away from the stuffy constrictions of traditional British tailoring, they created a new look that was fresh, modern, and stylish. Today, their legacy continues to inspire new generations of designers. Here at Edinburgh Tailoring Company, we often receive commissions from clients for tailoring with a difference.

The enterprise was funded by the singer Cilla Black and Peter Brown of Apple, the Beatles's record company. Describing his first look Nutter said: 'Everybody was wearing a narrow suit at the end of the 1960s ... so I just went wild with the lapels and cut them as wide as you possibly could - enormous - and it was terribly flared at the jacket. So that was my first look and it was different from anybody else.' Tommy Nutter\u2019s celebrity clientele included Mick Jagger. Eric Clapton and the Beatles, who are pictured wearing his suits on the front cover of 'Abbey Road'. Such connections enabled Nutter to introduce high fashion to Savile Row and thus effect enormous influence on British menswear.\n\n\n\nThis suit was given by Sir Roy Strong, author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974 to1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Dating to around 1980, this suit was worn by Sir Roy for public and formal occasions in his capacity as Museum Director. Sir Roy became known for his vigorous support of modern design and was also recognised for his own sartorial flair."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/02/house-of-nutter-by-lance-richardson-review", "page_content": "When 25-year-old Tommy Nutter launched his self-named shop at 35a Savile Row in February 1969 he was the first new tailor to set up there in more than a century. \u201cThe Row\u201d had never seen the like before, whether in the dramatic cut of the clothes (\u201cNeo-Edwardian dandyism\u201d), the bold style of the shopfront (huge plate-glass windows) or the louche clientele of pop stars, models, West End impresarios and East End gangsters who flocked to the showroom. Cilla Black was one of his friends and early backers. The Beatles, his neighbours at Apple Records a few doors along, would soon put the Nutter brand on the map by wearing his clobber on the cover of Abbey Road: only George, in gravedigger denim, failed to follow suit.\n\nLance Richardson\u2019s lively, affectionate, occasionally breathless book is a double narrative, the story of two brothers who rose from modest north London origins to the fringes of international stardom. David (b1939) and Tommy (b1943) grew up above a cafe in the pinched black-and-white dreariness of Edgware with parents neither of them much liked. Both brothers were gay, restless, in love with glamour, bunking off school to watch West Side Story at Her Majesty\u2019s theatre \u201cover and over\u201d. At 20, Tommy had matinee idol looks that he parlayed into a brief career modelling for John Stephen\u2019s boutiques in the early 1960s. He gradually got a foothold in fashionable Mayfair via Brian Epstein\u2019s best friend Peter Brown, while peacock couturier Michael (\u201cMr\u201d) Fish encouraged him to open a place of his own.\n\nWith the help of a brilliant young cutter, Edward Sexton, the distinctive Nutter silhouette was born \u2013 tight waist and chest, flared trousers and jacket lapels as wide as bowling alleys. It was modern, subversive, defiantly camp and oddly beautiful. When John Lennon married Yoko Ono in Gibraltar the House of Nutter played a significant part; Lennon\u2019s cream cord suit was made by Tommy, while David took their wedding photographs. Mick and Bianca Jagger were another celebrity couple who fell for the Nutters.\n\nThe Beatles wear Nutter\u2019s clobber on the cover of Abbey Road \u2013 only George, in denim, failed to follow suit. Photograph: PA\n\nBoth brothers, as Richardson makes clear, were more fragile personalities than their public front suggested. Tommy, the more flamboyant of the two, ran the shop more like a private club than a business, and would disappear for days on end to his bolthole in Brighton. Once, on being refused admittance to a Tate gallery party, he crossed the road and threw himself in the Thames \u2013 \u201can almost Shakespearean overreaction\u201d, his brother recalled. David, gregarious but needy, decamped to New York at the beginning of the 1970s and became court photographer to Lennon and later to Elton John. His love of partying until the sun came up earned him the nickname (and the book\u2019s dedication) \u201cDawn Black\u201d, which also alluded to his long-term struggle with drugs and depression.\n\nIt\u2019s rather touching to read the brothers\u2019 correspondence (they remained close despite living on different continents), though of the pair it\u2019s Tommy\u2019s rise and fall that is the more compelling. His bust-up with Sexton in 1976 left him out in the cold, and he bristled at the sight of his name over a shop he no longer ran. I wonder if Richardson is joking when he likens Tommy\u2019s subsequent collaboration with Kilgour in Dover Street to \u201cPicasso\u2019s Blue Period\u201d? I hope he is. Tommy\u2019s ready-to-wear collection for an old-school tailor may have been groundbreaking at the time, but art it ain\u2019t. His opportunism \u2013 in his own words, \u201chaving a bit of fun\u201d \u2013 was never more evident than in 1982 when, as Thatcher\u2019s war armada set sail for the Falklands, he showcased his own \u201cNautical Look\u201d, marine blue with jaunty peaked caps. It seems to have sunk without trace.\n\nA fog of financial mismanagement settles over the last third of the book as Tommy comes to realise that his name will not achieve the international reach of, say, Paul Smith. His dreaminess had always outpaced his business sense. He was perhaps too closely identified with the late 60s/early 70s scene he helped to create: caught between being a star and a Savile Row eminence, he didn\u2019t quite fulfil himself as either. He always seemed to be making a comeback, until something more tragic ensured there would not be another. David, haunted early by the spectre of HIV among his friends in New York, decisively reined in his sybaritic lifestyle. For Tommy the warnings came too late. When he told a friend he had Aids she said: \u201cTommy, you\u2019ve got to be positive.\u201d \u201cI just said that,\u201d he snapped. \u201cI am \u2018positive\u2019\u201d.\n\nDistressed by his appearance he withdrew to his tiny flat in Conduit Street, Mayfair, and awaited the end. In a late interview he was asked what made him happy, and replied that his two favourite things were Coronation Street and Sondheim musicals. He died in August 1992, aged 49. David, whose reminiscences are central to the book and gratefully acknowledged by the author, still lives in New York. When asked what he\u2019s most proud of he replies: \u201cProbably surviving, because nobody else did.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://airmail.news/issues/2022-7-2/when-savile-row-met-carnaby-street", "page_content": "On May 12, 1971, Mick Jagger married Bianca P\u00e9rez-Mora Mac\u00edas in St. Tropez. You\u2019ve probably seen the photos: Mick and Bianca kneeling before a robed officiant, getting mobbed in the street, exuding joy in the back seat of a car.\n\nThis was a union not destined for the long haul, and the wedding itself proved to Bianca that she\u2019d made a mistake. Her new husband was reportedly more interested in partying with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr that night than in spending time with her. But what an impression Mick and Bianca made, she in Yves Saint Laurent and he in Tommy Nutter.\n\nI\u2019ve long marveled at the creamy, amply lapeled 1930s-inspired three-piece that Mick wore that day in 1971. The suit was the work of Edward Sexton, who cut it in his role as shears-wielder-in-chief at the House of Nutter, 35a Savile Row, London.\n\nMick Jagger wore a Nutter suit to marry Bianca in St. Tropez in 1971.\n\nThe atelier was founded by Tommy Nutter himself, the tailor of choice for rock stars, Swinging London notables, and anyone who wanted to look like one. Several years ago, I caught wind of the fact that Sexton was making the Jagger suit again. In fact, he\u2019d never really stopped making it, depending on the whims of his clientele. And so, during one of the periodic stopovers that Sexton and his emissaries make in New York, I decided to go pay a visit.\n\nI had little more than fandom to propel me, along with the business card of a men\u2019s magazine, as I made my way to an uptown hotel suite. I had to see the suit in person.\n\nThe tailor of choice for rock stars, Swinging London notables, and anyone who wanted to look like one.\n\nIt was Nutter\u2014flamboyant, pop-star handsome, and self-described \u201cepitome of the old-fashioned English boy\u201d\u2014who had turned the Row upside down, bringing bespoke to the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll set while bringing a big dose of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll to bespoke.\n\nIngrid Boulting, Nutter, and Bianca Jagger, at a party in the mid-1970s.\n\nNutter tailoring was about sartorial pyrotechnics that would have made Beau Brummell blush: soaring lapels, roped shoulders, crotch-accentuating trousers that flared with exuberant splendor, an expansive approach to pattern and texture. The Nutter look was a throwback to the glory days of Dick Diver and the Duke of Windsor and yet utterly futuristic: glam before glam. Unusually for the Row, it dared to have overt sex appeal: Nutter suits were wearable aphrodisiacs.\n\nFittingly, Nutter opened his shop on Valentine\u2019s Day 1969; he was all of 25. Thanks to him, the Peacock Revolution had breached the stately redoubt of Huntsman, Gieves & Hawkes, Poole, Kilgour. Sexton was his trusted lieutenant and the talented young cutters Joseph Morgan and Roy Chittleborough filled out the Nutter team. That March, John Lennon, affectionately known around the shop as \u201cSusan,\u201d wore a white Nutter suit when he married Yoko Ono in \u201cGibraltar near Spain.\u201d In August, three Beatles put on Nutter suits, which Sexton had cut, for the Abbey Road cover shoot. (George Harrison opted for Woodstock-inspired denims.) Soon enough, David Hockney, Twiggy, Elton John, Bill Blass, assorted aristos and Hollywood stars\u2014everybody, it seemed, was getting \u201cNuttered up.\u201d\n\nIt was allegedly the Beatles, then headquartered at 3 Savile Row, who introduced Jagger to Nutter. The Stones front man sized up the tailor and said, \u201cI\u2019ll have a suit like the one you\u2019re wearing.\u201d (When Mae West met Nutter, she had a similar reaction: \u201cCome up and do a suit for me sometime.\u201d) Jagger said that \u201cTommy brought Savile Row up to date without losing its tradition.\u201d Nutter\u2019s own take was nonchalant: \u201cI don\u2019t really care what\u2019s going on. I just do what I like.\u201d\n\nJohn Lennon wore a white Nutter suit to his wedding to Yoko Ono in Gibraltar, 1969.\n\nFive years after Mick and Bianca\u2019s wedding, Nutter decided to leave his own shop. Sexton, Chittleborough, and Morgan kept it going until it shuttered in the early 1980s. It was the Thatcher-Reagan era, which meant that Establishment sobriety was in style. Still, it had been an incredible, improbable run; as Sexton put it, \u201cThe bitchy old queens said we wouldn\u2019t last six months.\u201d Nutter\u2019s last huzzah was designing the Joker costumes for Jack Nicholson in Batman in 1989. He died of an AIDS-related illness on August 17, 1992, at the age of 49.\n\nBut the Nutter legacy lives on. His ace cutters are still around\u2014and mostly still working. Sexton, who has been based in Knightsbridge since 1990, mentored Stella McCartney and continues to service high-level clients around the world.\n\nA few years ago, I had a companionable visit with the wonderful Joe Morgan at Chittleborough & Morgan (who happened to have made suits for the late Charlie Watts). Chittleborough retired in 2011, but Morgan still has the old patterns, and the old crazy stories to go with them: sometimes anecdotes are the best accessories of all. Along with Sexton, he keeps working the classic Nutter elements: romance, spice, a touch of grandeur, and a playfulness built upon the tectonics of expert tailoring. He also mentored the incredible contemporary tailor Michael Browne. Next time you\u2019re in London, go visit Morgan and Sexton both.\n\nTwiggy wore a velvet three-piece suit with satin trim by Tommy Nutter for a Vogue shoot at the Russian Tea Room, 1970.\n\nWhen I arrived at the hotel suite for my own Sexton appointment in New York, the master himself wasn\u2019t present. But an able representative chatted me up, put me at quiescent ease, and then approached with the Jagger wedding jacket (or \u201ccoat,\u201d in Savile Row parlance). I hesitated to put it on. It really did feel presumptuous.\n\nHe eased it over my shoulders (a tad thicker, perhaps, than the original client\u2019s) and it was like slipping into a second skin, the skin I was meant to have. I could feel my comfort, confidence, and attractiveness levels rocketing upwards. I dreaded going to the mirror, expecting to find a middle-aged dad wearing a rock-star jacket. But no: It looked great. Beyond great. Sexton once said that when clients put on his clothes, they sometimes became aroused. I wouldn\u2019t go quite that far, but even if marital bliss proved to be fleeting for Mick and Bianca, they must have had one hell of a honeymoon.\n\nPhotos: Iain MacMillan/Capital/EMI/Photofest; Lichfield Archive/Getty Images; TopFoto; Agent/Mirrorpix/Newscom; Justin de Villeneuve/Cond\u00e9 Nast/Shutterstock"}]}
