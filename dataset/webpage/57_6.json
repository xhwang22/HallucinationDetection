McCabe was second in 2:24.81, which was also good enough to qualify for London.\n\nThose times are currently the second- and third-fastest in the world this year, according to Swimming Canada, behind the 2:22.73 of reigning Olympic champion Rebecca Soni of the U.S.\n\nWith one day of trials remaining Sunday, 30 athletes have earned the right to represent Canada in the pool in London.\n\nA maximum of two swimmers per event can qualify with the exception freestyle because four swimmers have to be chosen for the relay.\n\nJulia Wilkinson of Stratford, Ont., picked up her third victory by winning the 100-metre freestyle. Runner-up Victoria Poon of Hong Kong also qualified.\n\nToronto's Heather MacLean and Samantha Cheverton of Pointe-Claire, Que., round out the women's freestyle relay team.\n\nJoe Bartoch of London, Ont., will race the men's Olympic 100-metre butterfly for the second time in his career. Toronto's Tobias Oriwol qualified in the men's 200-metre backstroke.\n\nVancouver's Savannah King and Toronto's Alexa Komarnycky finished first and second respectively in the women's 800-metre freestyle to book their tickets to London. King also qualified in the 400-metres earlier this week.\n\nVan Beilen burst into tears when she finished second in the 100 breaststroke Tuesday and qualified for London for the first time.\n\nThe pressure to make the Olympic team off her shoulders, the first-year University of British Columbia student was more in control of her emotions Saturday.\n\n\"I said to myself this morning if I do end up making the team, the tears are going to stay inside of me this time,\" she said. \"A lot of people came up to me two days ago saying I got them to tears, so I didn't want to do that again.\n\n\"I wanted to race and have fun and be more happy when I came out.\"\n\nPierse, who still holds the long-course record of 2:20.12 set in 2009, was fifth in 2:27.14.\n\n\"It's actually really hard to see because I know how much Annamay has put into the sport and she's a really hard worker,\" McCabe said. \"We really wouldn't be where we are today in breaststroke if it wasn't for Annamay.\n\n\"She still has the world record, so she knows something we don't know still. You can't take away from her.\"\n\nPierce is the second swim star to fall short of the Olympic team at these trials. Mike Brown, fourth in the 100-metre breaststroke at the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing, also did not qualify.\n\nAfter setting the world record in 2009, Pierse had a difficult season. She suffered through a debilitating bout of dengue fever contracted at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.\n\n\"It really has been the hardest two or three years of my life,\" Pierse said through her tears. \"This is sport. It's what I love about it. It's what I hate about it, the ups and the downs.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I've had more downs than ups in the last little while.\"\n\nWilkinson was also first in the 100-metre backstroke and the 200-metre individual medley at trials. She'll try for a fourth win in the 200-metre backstroke Sunday.\n\n\"My dad, when I was little, used to bribe me to do well at meets, so he said on the subway today 'you know, if you go four-for-four I'll buy you an iPad,'\" Wilkinson said. \"The 200-back is going to be hard, but iPad right?\"\n\nBartoch says Canada needs more depth in men's butterfly.\n\n\"A couple of years ago, I put it out (there) if somebody beats me, I'll retire,\" the 29-year-old said. \"No one's really come up to the challenge yet. When Mike Minentko retired, there was a big void there. I had to catch up where he was.\n\n\"I wish somebody was coming up. No one is coming to London and saying 'I want to train with Joe Bartoch and do what he's doing' so they're kind of paying for it It's always good to train with someone faster than you. I've been around for awhile so I have a lot of advice I could give.\"\n\nOriwol finished 15th in backstroke in the event in Beijing.\n\n\"My hopes are to be deep in the final,\" Oriwol said. \"As you can see already at the Olympic trials, if you're in the final anything can happen. Upsets happen and people don't swim like they're supposed to. Once I'm in the final, I just want to have a lane.\"\n\nMcCabe was cheered on a large contingent in green T-shirts that said \"Team Fleabag.\"\n\n\"My dad used to call me the flea growing up,\" she explained. \"I didn't know they were going to do that.\"\n\nMcCabe cautioned than even though she and Van Beilen posted eye-catching times, there are other countries who have yet to hold their Olympic trials and everyone will be quicker come London.\n\n\"Those times might get bumped down,\" McCabe said. \"Whether they do or not, by the time we get there, we're going to have to be faster.\"\n\nThe Paralympic trials are running in conjunction with trials. Montreal's Benoit Huot won his fourth race in as many nights with a victory in the 100-metre butterfly.\n\nValeria Grand-Maison, a triple gold medallist at the 2008 Paralympics, was fastest in the 100-metre butterfly.\n\nSummer Mortimer of Burlington, Ont., took the women's 100-metre freestyle. Kyle McMahon of Prince George, B.C., was the men's 50-metre butterfly victor."}, {"url": "https://www.ubyssey.ca/sports/tera-van-beilen-swim-queen/", "page_content": "A young girl walks across the deck of a pool in Oakville, Ontario. She\u2019s eight years old, in that chubby phase every kid goes through, swimming her first novice swim practice ever without any goggles. When she finishes, the first thing she says to her mum, after asking to get some goggles, is when the next swim practice is. All it took was one swim practice to get her hooked, and she hasn\u2019t looked back since.\n\nTera Van Beilen is an unbreakable force in the pool. In a solid 15-year career, she\u2019s made waves in the world of competitive swimming. She has been a part of four CIS championship teams with the UBC Thunderbirds, participated in the inaugural Youth Olympic Games in 2010 and won a pair of silvers at the 2011 and 2013 Universiades. Most notably, she qualified for her first Olympic Games in 2012 in the 100m and 200m breaststroke events.\n\nBut after 15 years of furious training and competing, Van Beilen has decided to hang up her suit and goggles, and retire from competitive swimming after missing the qualifying standard for the Rio 2016 Olympic games. This can be a heavy hit for most athletes, but Tera was smiling and positive when she spoke to us.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little shocked to be going through as much joy as I am now. I love the sport so much, and I will miss it \u2026 Swimming teaches you how to deal with these situations and making the best of what comes about and I think that's been really important in this transition phase,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nThis was not an easy decision either. After devoting years of her life to this sport, she reflects on her career and has no regrets.\n\n\u201cI didn't want to go into Olympic Trials thinking \u2018If I don't make the Olympics, life is over\u2019. I wanted to go in with confidence that I could potentially make it, and at the end of the day I actually swam the fastest that I ever had in four years and I have no regrets about the way I swam and the training and the last year. It's just the other girls were faster.\u201d\n\nVan Beilen isn\u2019t unfamiliar with this change in dynamics and \"passing the torch\". When she qualified for the Olympics back in 2012, she beat out reigning Canadian champion and record holder Annamay Pierse for the gold medal and the elusive spot on the Canadian team.\n\n\u201cMaking the Olympics was something that I actually didn't think I would realistically do in 2012, I thought it would be more of a 2016 goal and ended up doing it. In the moment after touching the wall, it was still something that was so surreal. Now, looking back on it, I will forever be an Olympian.\u201d\n\nYou could argue that she owes a bit of her success to the time that she\u2019s spent in Vancouver, especially at UBC. Despite receiving offers for full-ride scholarships from many American colleges, Van Beilen made the \u201chardest choice of her life.\u201d She decided to attend UBC to pursue her Olympic dreams.\n\n\u201cThe head coach of the Vancouver (High Performance) Centre flew to my house for dinner, and told me everything about UBC, and I was like it's a no-brainer. I need to come to this school. I would be training with Joseph Nagy, who's one of the best breaststroke coaches in the world, and putting myself in a tough environment where most of the members of the team had qualified for international competitions, all while earning a degree. Really, there\u2019s no other choice that seemed as perfect as UBC,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nAfter five years of gruelling high-performance training \u2014 including 10 two-hour swim practices a week alongside five hours of dryland training and balancing full-time schooling \u2014 Van Beilen feels blessed to have had this opportunity.\n\n\u201cI came [to UBC] because I wanted to make the Olympic team, that was my dream since I was a little kid. So I said whatever is going to get me there, I'm going to do. To get a degree at the same time too? It was tough, but I'm glad it did it,\u201d Van Beilen said.\n\nAs she heads into her final months at UBC, Van Beilen is finishing up her kinesiology degree and hopes to hit the pool again sometime soon. More importantly, she\u2019s looking towards the future with bright eyes, a positive attitude and some valuable life lessons under her wings.\n\n\u201cThere are flips and flops in swimming, and that's what is so exciting. You win and you lose. Here I am now, happy and excited,\u201d said Van Beilen.\n\nWho knows what\u2019s next for this Olympian, but we\u2019re sure it won\u2019t be the last we see of Tera Van Beilen."}, {"url": "https://www.biographies.net/biography/tera-van-beilen/m/0k8kvd7", "page_content": "Who is Tera Van Beilen?\n\nTera van Beilen is a Canadian swimmer and Olympian.\n\nIn the 2010 Summer Youth Olympic Games in Singapore, Van Beilen won a gold medal in Women's 100m Breaststroke and a silver in Women's 200m Breaststroke.\n\nIn 2012, While competing in the Canadian Olympic trials in Montreal, Van Beilen had successfully qualified for her Olympic dream. She placed first with a time of 2:24.03, ahead of Canadian swimmer Martha McCabe with a time of 2:24.81. Van Beilen's timing placed her second in the world for 2012, behind 2:22.73 of reigning American Olympic champion Rebecca Soni.\n\nDuring the 2012 Summer Olympics, Van Beilen received much attention as a Canadian Olympian. She participated in the women's 100m and 200m Breaststroke categories, as well as the women's 4x100m Medley Relay. While competing in the Women's 100m breaststroke, she proceeded to the semi-finals, only to be eliminated in a swim-off with Alia Atkinson of Jamaica.\n\nOutside of the 2012 Olympic Games, Van Beilen competes regularly at the local, provincial, and international level swimming competitions.

That was days after her 19th birthday. \u201cPeople even ask me for autographs,\u201d says Van Beilen, one of UBC\u2019s student-athletes going to London this summer. \u201cIt\u2019s all so crazy and surreal, I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s actually my life.\u201d\n\nVan Beilen came to UBC last year to study kinesiology and to swim. Even though she now considers herself a UBC athlete, she will always be a representative of her hometown of Oakville, Ontario. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird, they kind of just want to own me everywhere,\u201d she says.\n\nHer swim for an Olympic medal wasn\u2019t supposed to happen this year and for that, she credits UBC.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really all thanks to training with my coach Jozsef Nagy and being in the Aquatic Centre here in Vancouver,\u201d says Van Beilen, who notes that UBC\u2019s reputation as a swimming powerhouse is living up to her expectations.\n\nThe life of a world-class swimmer has its ups and downs, as Van Beilen describes her daily routine just weeks before the big event. Four times a week she has practices early in the morning, around lunchtime and in the evening; in between, she naps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of hours a week. I don\u2019t bother to count because it makes me feel like I\u2019m crazy.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, her love for swimming, and seeing how far she has come, helps her drag her feet out of bed every morning. \u201cI have a bigger goal in mind,\u201d she says.\n\nCompeting at the Olympic level has given Van Beilen experiences that most people will never have. \u201cSometimes when I\u2019m on the blocks in Australia, Europe or China, I think to myself: \u2018am I actually in this country swimming? I have such a crazy life,\u2019 and then the beeper goes and it is time to focus.\u201d\n\nNow the big event is just around the corner for Van Beilen, who is still unsure whether both her parents will get to watch her living her dream. She has only received one guest ticket to her events thus far.\n\n\u201cWhen I think about both my swim events being sold out, it makes me a little freaked out,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen Van Beilen steps into the spotlight in London, it won\u2019t just be the 17,000 spectators watching, it will be the whole world. That\u2019s a lot of pressure for a newcomer.\n\n\u201cI always swim well under pressure. I like the adrenaline. Nobody knows who I am so I can use that to my advantage; I can surprise them all.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.swimontario.com/news/canada-games-legacy-series-tera-van-beilen/", "page_content": "April 12, 2022\n\nTera Van Beilen\n\nOver the next few weeks, Swim Ontario is presenting the Canada Games Legacy Series, where we take a look back at swimmers who represented Team Ontario at past Canada Summer Games.\n\nThere is something to be said about inspiring girls to become confident in sport, and believe that greatness is possible.\n\nTera (Van Beilen) Maloney knows that feeling because she has experienced it. Now, in many ways, she\u2019s an icon of success for others.\n\nIt may have been back when she was five years old, benefitting from a pool in her home backyard, that a light started to trickle. One of a youngster\u2019s desire to be competitive, noticed, and having that desire to win.\n\nVan Beilen, now married and whose maiden name we will use in this feature, has many stories about her younger years in the world of arts and sports. There were those ballet lessons, playing piano and the introduction to soccer.\n\nBut it was always swimming that superseded everything else.\n\nShe eloquently described it as \u201cthat urge to stay in the pool, never get out and even, at times, want to eat dinner while in the water\u201d.\n\nThat may have been an early taste of what would lie ahead for this water baby.\n\nThere\u2019s a New York city pop band, called American Authors, known for the song \u201cThe Best Days of My Life\u201d. Listen to it. Tap your foot to the music, even sing along if you know the lyrics when you read more about Van Beilen.\n\n\u201cI had a dream so big and loud\n\nI jumped so high I touched the clouds\n\nWo-o-o-o-o-oh, wo-o-o-o-o-oh\n\nI stretched my hands out to the sky.\u201d\n\nBest Days of My Life, American Authors\n\nIt might be a tune that she may consider attaching to her prosperous swim career.\n\nWhen mentioning the real inauguration to competitive swimming, this might surprise many. It wasn\u2019t any of the events she competed in - the Commonwealth Games, FINA World championships or even the Summer Olympics.\n\nIt all started in 2009, in Charlottetown, P.E.I., at the Canada Summer Games.\n\nCanada\u2019s national spotlight on amateur sport was where Van Beilen would begin to relish fame with a remarkable performance and go on to win six gold medals.\n\n\u201cI remember it very well and asking myself \u2013 how did I do this,\u201d she said in a recent telephone conversation. \u201cAlso, medalling at the Canadian Nationals and realizing that I was able to do more than just the breaststroke, but also compete in the relays and help my team. That was the year that started my competitive swim career.\u201d\n\nWith the beautiful Niagara Region of Ontario hosting the 2022 Canada Summer Games in August, an event that brings together some 5,000 promising athletes, a mere mention of those days brings back fond memories for Van Beilen, who has a Maple Leaf tattoo on one of her toes.\n\n\u201cThe Canada Summer Games were an incredible experience, a special time in my life and a glimpse at top level athletes in many sports,\u201d she said, while also confirming a rumour that she liked to eat yoghurt-covered raisins before competing.\n\n\u201cThings were different in my day, as you could be a National calibre athlete in those Games. But now, it\u2019s really focussed for younger kids with potential \u2013 more of a stepping stone for success, to experience and cherish the moment. It could very well be the start of something big for many.\u201d\n\nWhile she graduated from King\u2019s Christian Collegiate in Oakville, a school that now has the \u201cVan Beilen Endeavour Award\u201d given to a student who excels in arts, music, or sports outside of school, her swim keys to success started with the Oakville Aquatic Club.\n\nChoosing post-secondary education in Canada, over numerous athletic scholarship offers from schools throughout the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Van Beilen picked the University of British Columbia.\n\nNot only did she continue her academic honors success, and left UBC with a Degree in Kinesiology, but she was on the Thunderbirds incredible swim team that won four consecutive Canadian Interuniversity Sports (now re-branded to USports) championships.\n\nThere was also the Swim Youth Olympics in Singapore, where she won three medals, that would come a year after the Canada Summer Games. One who excelled in the breaststroke, Van Beilen would add one major event after another. Then came the electrifying and emotional time in her life that she will never forget.\n\n\u201cThe Canadian Olympic Trials in Montreal, I knew when I had touched the wall that made the qualifying time needed to make Canada\u2019s team for the 2012 Games in London (England),\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the feeling of representing your country at the Olympics.\u201d\n\nThat was the same Van Beilen, who didn\u2019t like wearing swim goggles or a bathing cap as a youngster, and preferred to sleep in on mornings devoted to swim practices. That is, until her parents asked her to make a choice between sticking with swimming and its challenges, or packing it in. Judgment time, and she picked swimming and has never looked back.\n\nBoth her parents had been athletes, an uncle played in the National Hockey League and a cousin in the Canadian and National Football Leagues, the genes were in the family.\n\nWith her competitive days eventually now having come to a close, she really hasn\u2019t bid adieu to the sport. She\u2019s now Marketing Manager for Speedo Canada, a company that inspires swimmers by offering up a brand of stylish merchandise.\n\n\u201cSwimming helped me in life and brought me so much joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were many times when I could laugh, cry through my goggles, release so much energy, and allow me to make friends for life.\u201d\n\n\n\nDavid Grossman is a veteran multi award-winning Journalist and Broadcaster with some of Canada\u2019s major media, including the Toronto Star and SPORTSNET 590 THE FAN, and a Public Relations professional for 45+ years in Canadian sports and Government relations."}]}
