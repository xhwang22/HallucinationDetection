You\u2019ll join thousands of Japanese fans as they support their team \u2014 and in Japan, that doesn\u2019t mean throwing on a cap, grabbing a hot dog, and ignoring the game for the first seven innings. While the people of Tokyo are often quiet and reserved in public spaces, that changes in the frenetic atmosphere of the ballpark.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering attending a Tokyo baseball game, here\u2019s everything you need to know to make the most of the experience.\n\nWhat Baseball Teams Play In Tokyo?\n\nThe highest level of Japanese baseball is Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), which consists of two leagues, the Pacific League and the Central League. It\u2019s comparable to Major League Baseball (MLB) in the United States, and many of the teams have several former MLB players on their rosters.\n\nEach NPB league has six teams, and two of those teams are based in Tokyo: the Tokyo Yakult Swallows and the Yomiuri Giants. Three other teams are close enough to Tokyo for a day trip: the Chiba Lotte Marines, the Yokohama DeNA BayStars, and the Saitama Seibu Lions.\n\nOf these teams, the Yomiuri Giants are the most popular. They\u2019re sometimes referred to as the New York Yankees of the NPB due to their winning history and large fan base. They play home games in the Tokyo Dome, which makes them a safe ticket for Western tourists (since rain won\u2019t cause a cancellation or delay).\n\nYomiuri Giants tickets can be expensive, and if you\u2019re on a budget, Tokyo Swallows tickets might be a better option. The Swallows play their games at Meiji Jingu Stadium, which is within walking distance of the Tokyo Dome. It\u2019s an open-air stadium, so you\u2019ll want to check the weather when purchasing tickets.\n\nWhen To See A Baseball Game In Tokyo\n\nThe NPB baseball season typically starts in late March or early April and concludes with playoffs in October (as with the MLB, exact opening dates and playoff dates change from one season to the next). Games occur almost every day, but most teams take Mondays off. There are a total of 146 games per year.\n\nAs with American baseball games, the most exciting contests typically occur at the beginning and end of the season, but Japanese crowds make the game fun even in the dog days of summer. You can grab a ticket any time and enjoy the experience. However, if you\u2019re buying tickets to a big game \u2014 such as opening day, or any playoff game \u2014 you\u2019ll want to buy as early as possible. Fortunately, that\u2019s a fairly easy process.\n\nHow To Get Tickets For A Baseball Game In Tokyo\n\nWhile you can buy your tickets at the stadium, sellouts aren\u2019t unheard of. All NPB teams have English websites, although some have significant translation issues. We purchased tickets on the Tokyo Yakult Swallows website, which wasn\u2019t exactly a straightforward process; however, if you\u2019re patient enough to read carefully, you won\u2019t have a problem.\n\nPer an email we received after making the purchase, we\u2019d have received a full refund if our game had been rained out. We picked up our tickets from will call without issue; the ticket attendants asked for our names, and we were on our way into the stadium.\n\nIf you have trouble with team websites, you can use a third-party site that caters to Westerners. Sites like Voyagin feature a more streamlined ordering process, but if you use them, be prepared to pay more for your tickets.\n\nIf you\u2019d prefer to wait, you can usually buy tickets at the gate, particularly if you\u2019re seeing the Swallows (we\u2019re told the Yomiuri Giants sell out more frequently). As a last resort, you can always get tickets from scalpers (yes, scalpers exist in Japan), but of course, you\u2019ll pay for the privilege.\n\nA word of warning: NPB stadiums have dedicated sections for visiting fans. If you\u2019re planning on rooting for a particular team, make sure you\u2019re sitting in the right section. Otherwise, you might find yourself decked out in Yomiuri Giants gear while sitting next to dozens of unimpressed BayStars fans.\n\nWhat To Expect From A Baseball Game In Tokyo\n\nThe experience of watching a baseball game in Japan is substantially different from the experience of watching an American game. Generally speaking, Japanese baseball games move faster; tie games can occur, except under special circumstances in the playoffs, and game lengths are usually limited to 12 innings. That being said, it\u2019s still baseball, and baseball is a fairly slow game, so expect to spend 3 or 4 hours at the ballpark.\n\nIn general, we found Japanese fans to be more attentive than their American counterparts; we didn\u2019t see a single person gazing at a phone when teams had scoring opportunities, and all of the fans in our section seemed invested in every at-bat. By the end of the game, we were cheering loudly for our team \u2014 and we still look for Swallows highlights on YouTube on occasion.\n\nIn Japan, there\u2019s an emphasis on fan safety that might seem unusual to Westerners. Large nettings cover most areas where fans sit, protecting against hard-hit foul balls. When a pop-up heads toward the stands, you might hear a loud whistle, which warns you to watch out.\n\nJohn Krane\n\nFood And Beverage Options At Tokyo Baseball Stadiums\n\nJust as you\u2019d find a variety of food options in a modern MLB stadium, you\u2019ll have no shortage of options at an NPB game. American classics like hot dogs and burgers are available, along with bento boxes filled with sushi and other traditional Japanese fare. The food attendants are polite, and they deal with foreigners regularly; if you don\u2019t know the Japanese word for an item, you can simply point at a picture on the menu.\n\nAs in the United States, food and drinks are significantly more expensive once you\u2019re inside the ballpark. However, many stadiums will allow you to bring food and drinks \u2014 including alcoholic beverages \u2014 into the park. You\u2019ll have to transfer alcoholic drinks into paper cups at the gate (the park staff will give you some direction here).\n\nMost stadiums will also allow visitors to bring one or two snacks, so if you\u2019re hoping to save money, stock up on your way in. If you don\u2019t bring your own stuff, don\u2019t worry. Concession attendants (typically young women) walk the park, offering beer, soda, and other treats. When paying, don\u2019t tip them, since it isn\u2019t customary in Japan.\n\nIf you have dietary restrictions, we recommend carrying a card that explains your needs. JustHungry offers a variety of free printable cards here.\n\nTraditions At Tokyo Baseball Games\n\nAll NPB teams have special team songs, and in some cases, several songs. The fans around you will start singing occasionally. Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t know Japanese \u2014 you won\u2019t feel out of place if you simply clap along and cheer at the end of the tune.\n\nOther celebrations help to enhance the experience. Tokyo Swallows fans are famous for their umbrella dance, performed after their team scores a run. It\u2019s something to behold, particularly for Western baseball fans who aren\u2019t used to large choreographed celebrations (other than the Wave).\n\nSome teams also release balloons called jet fusen during the seventh-inning stretch. This tradition makes for a colorful display \u2014 imagine 40,000 balloons drifting into the open air all at once \u2014 but it\u2019s gradually falling out of fashion in Japan due to health concerns. Nevertheless, if you see the people in your section pulling out balloons, get your camera ready.\n\nBecause Japanese fans are typically very invested in their teams, it\u2019s a good idea to pick up some team gear on your way into the ballpark. You\u2019ll find stores selling merchandise outside every stadium, and you can pick up a cap for $20.\n\nWhether you\u2019re traveling alone or with family, a Tokyo baseball game makes for a memorable excursion. Go with an open mind and allow yourself to let loose; you\u2019ll learn a bit about modern Japanese culture, enjoy some great comfort food, and maybe even learn a song or two (if you can track down the English lyrics). You\u2019ll certainly leave with a new appreciation for one of Japan\u2019s most popular sports.\n\nPhoto Credit: Cao Luning / Shutterstock"}, {"url": "https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/11/3b0e7bf3c2a8-baseball-yakult-swallows-star-murakami-reveals-mlb-ambitions.html", "page_content": "KYODO NEWS - Nov 14, 2022 - 18:04 | Sports, All\n\nThe Yakult Swallows' record-breaking slugger Munetaka Murakami revealed Monday he has his sights set on a move to the majors as soon as possible.\n\nOne of Japanese baseball's brightest talents, the 22-year-old third baseman was unequivocal about wanting to join the likes of countryman Shohei Ohtani in MLB when quizzed by reporters during a media conference at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo.\n\n\"Of course I want to try.
