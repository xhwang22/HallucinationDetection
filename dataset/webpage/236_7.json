{"Ted Childs worked at Microsoft, Oracle, Sun Microsystems, Apple, and currently at Google.": [{"url": "https://thenewstack.io/sun-microsystems-a-look-back-at-a-tech-company-ahead-of-its-time/", "page_content": "Sun Microsystems is a Silicon Valley legend. Ten years after it was acquired by Oracle, the company\u2019s past employees still have fond feelings for their former home \u2014 and a historic reunion happened two weeks ago at the Hyatt Regency by the San Francisco airport. Over 1,000 former Sun employees reunited for an evening to re-connect and to reminisce.\n\n\u201cIt was really fun,\u201d former Sun CEO and co-founder Scott McNealy told us with a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know, there\u2019s something crazy about the team we put together and the culture. Everybody had a fun attitude, and when people got together\u2026\u201d\n\nThe days that followed found Sun employees sharing nostalgic memories online and expressing their feelings of geek camaraderie, both past and present. But the reunion also offered a chance for Scott McNealy, along with everybody else, to reflect on what it all had meant. And how do you measure the legacy that a technology company \u2014 and its workers \u2014 are leaving behind?\n\n\u2018A Bigger Impact Than We Realized\u2019\n\nSo how was the reunion? \u201cIt was actually kind of weird,\u201d McNealy told us. \u201cI felt like it was some sort of rock concert where everybody was a celebrity to everybody else. People were just laughing, having a great time catching up, reminiscing, remembering. It\u2019s sort of like you\u2019d expect a reunion to be, only better.\u201d\n\nThe event\u2019s official website notes that over 150 senior executives attended, and \u201cThe attendee list included people from all years of Sun\u2019s existence, from employee #1 to some of the last pre-Oracle hires.\u201d\n\nMcNealy jokes that when he got married there were only 400 people at the wedding, and even then he\u2019d worried about meeting everybody. But after taking lots of selfies, \u201cFortunately they gave me the microphone and I got a chance to talk a bit about what we did and what it meant to me and the industry\u2026\u201d\n\nBut before the formal event, there was also a kind of \u201csummit\u201d where the four original co-founders met with the press, according to InfoWorld. Bill Joy, Andreas Bechtolsheim, and Vinod Khosla sat with Scott McNealy for what he describes as one of the memorable moments of the night \u2014 \u201cto hear everybody\u2019s perspectives\u2026 Sometimes you need to get a little distance to really understand what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking back now you can see who really did have an impact and change things,\u201d McNealy told us. He cites the example of Adam Osborne. While Osborne\u2019s company sold the first commercially successful portable computers back in 1981, it went bankrupt within 29 months. \u201cAdam Osborne was very famous back then, but he didn\u2019t impact the industry. There are many others that are just footnotes in the industry.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody thinks SPARC, Solaris, Java, the network as virtual computer, virtualization, all of the kind of things we did at Sun \u2014 are footnotes. They\u2019re bedrocks. So I think it was fun to actually get together and look back and say \u2018Yeah, we probably had a bigger impact than we realized at the time.'\u201d\n\nHanging out with the founders of Sun Microsystems, an amazing company that gave a lot to tech. pic.twitter.com/0g1umEdYYb \u2014 Joseph Menn (@josephmenn) September 29, 2019\n\nMcNealy remains proud of everything Sun accomplished, and later in the evening shared some of his feelings with his former employees. \u201cI remember standing up and saying, \u2018You know, they\u2019re all doing this diversity and inclusion thing. We did it 30 years ago without even thinking about it. That wasn\u2019t the goal, we just were inclusive and diverse\u2026\n\n\u201cAnd then I said, the other thing is we did all of this crazy innovation. We were light years ahead of our time. Sun was always way too early, whether it was doing cloud computing or open source or whatever. We were way ahead of our time, too far ahead of our time, because of the brilliant people we had that could look over the horizon\u2026\u201d\n\nInfoWorld reported that before the formal event, Bill Joy said mobile data networks had now transformed society, which got him remembering specific times when Sun had made early attempts at technologies that others later perfected. The site credited Sun with \u201ca range of open source software technologies still popular today,\u201d including the Java programming language and the Jenkins CI/CD platform. Sun had tried both natural language processing and, with Java ME, even programmable smartphones. \u201cBut the hardware was just really nascent at the time,\u201d Joy said.\n\nAnd McNealy remembered how Sun had shared the Network File System (NFS) protocol for storing and retrieving files over a network, back in 1984. InfoWorld quotes him as saying \u201cWe didn\u2019t invent open source but we [made it] happen. We were the leader of that parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cAsked if Sun should have moved from Sparc RISC processors and Solaris Unix to Intel processors and Linux, McNealy said he did not want to talk about mistakes he had made as Sun CEO but such a switch was not what Sun should have done.\u201d\n\nPay It Forward\n\nThe event also featured a thoughtful attempt to pass on some of that expertise, according to the reunion\u2019s official site. \u201cWe used this rare opportunity to pay it forward by sharing the expertise of some of our most knowledgeable alumni with the next generation of entrepreneurs.\u201d The Sun Reunion committee invited 100 MBA candidates from five local universities to hear a series of 20-minute \u201cSunTalks\u201d covering the future of education, work, technology, money, innovation, and thought. (\u201cSpecial guest\u201d speaker James Gosling, identified as \u201cthe father of Java,\u201d handled \u201cthe future of innovation.\u201d) The talks were followed by a 20-minute Q&A session.\n\nAnd the reunion also featured another panel titled \u201cCelebrating Success: Outstanding Women@Sun,\u201d featuring \u201cwomen who built on their experience at Sun to go on and have great accomplishments in the industry.\u201d Panelists included:\n\nLinda Popky (moderator) \u2014 Founder and President, Leverage2Market Associates\n\nEva Sage Gavin \u2014 Senior Managing Director, Accenture\u2019s Talent & Organization Consulting Practice\n\nNeha Sampat \u2014 CEO, Contentstack\n\nDenise Peck \u2014 Executive Advisor, Ascend\n\nNancy Hauge \u2014 CHRO, Automation Anywhere\n\nAnd all of the reunion\u2019s events were organized on Facebook, with a team of nearly two dozen former employees volunteering to help make it happen.\n\nWhat You Always Remember\n\nMcNealy still remembers the heartfelt memo he\u2019d sent on the eve of Sun\u2019s acquisition by Oracle. The memo\u2019s subject line was \u201cThanks for a great 28 years.\u201d In the emotional good-bye, McNealy had remembered how they\u2019d made it into the Fortune 200 while generating over $200 billion in revenue over the years, writing that Sun \u201cinnovated like crazy\u2026 And though we did not monetize our inventions as well as we could have, few companies have the track record in R&D that we had over the last 28 years.\u201d\n\nAnd nine years later, he paraphrases what he\u2019d written in that memo. \u201cOne of the biggest thrills was to be able to accomplish all that we accomplished without worrying about being embarrassed when my son read the newspaper the next morning. We broke the rules of business without breaking the law. We changed business in a big-time way, and we did it ethically, honestly, in an open and diverse and inclusive way.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s the feeling now? \u201cI think a lot of us are very \u2014 not remorseful or sad, but just \u2014 I think we all feel very blessed to have been at a magical moment with the company\u2026\u201d\n\nSteve Evans, a Sun engineer who was there for the company\u2019s first 13 years, from 1982 until 1995, created a poignant exhibit for the reunion. He took a low-resolution LED panel from his recent Burning Man art project, then used it to commemorate some iconic images from Sun\u2019s first 10 years.\n\nAs to the feeling at the reunion, Evans seems to have found a sense of continuity. \u201cMost of the folks I talked to were old co-workers and most were still working at Oracle in the Java group. Gosling had worked as part of my team for much of the time before the development of Java. I believe that those that stayed and continued after the Oracle deal enjoy being part of this successful and historically significant technology, and enjoy working with James, even if indirectly.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also something about a reunion that raises the question: whatever happened to those people who moved on to other companies? A page on the Sun Reunion site features the logos of companies where former Sun employees ended up. It includes major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, as well as enterprise heavyweights like IBM and Hewlett Packard, and big-name internet companies like Yahoo, eBay, Twitter, and Slack. There are cloud companies like Docker, Joyent, and Cloudera, disruptive transportation companies like Uber, Lyft, and Tesla, major consumer technology companies like Dell, Lenovo, Ericsson, and several Linux vendors (including Red Hat and Canonical). And of course, Oracle.\n\nAnd there\u2019s also a second page for new companies founded by Sun alumni. Mixed in with cloud companies like Cloudera and CloudBees, there\u2019s a logo for Nvidia \u2014 whose 1993 co-founders included two former Sun engineers.\n\nIn 1992 Sun even gave future Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella one of his jobs in the world of tech \u2014 and that\u2019s just one example of what McNealy described as \u201ca stunning genealogy\u201d of Sun employees moving on to other parts of the technology world. \u201cWe added it up at one point many years ago and found that there were a couple hundred minimum of former Sun employees who became CEOs. There\u2019s just been unbelievable numbers and companies that have gotten started as a result of Sun. \u201d\n\nMcNealy also shared one of the most underappreciated secrets of Sun\u2019s success. \u201cI probably used HR more heavily, and I\u2019m guessing more effectively than most companies, which is why you saw what you see at that reunion \u2014 the culture and the way people felt treated\u2026 I think sometimes people forget that a major asset in a tech company is the people. It\u2019s not the brands. Brands have the shelf life of a banana\u2026\u201d\n\nHere in 2019, \u201cI didn\u2019t see anybody who wasn\u2019t thrilled,\u201d McNealy said of the event. \u201cThe only sad part was the little poster board where they had all the people who are no longer with us.\u201d The Sun Reunion site has reproduced that poster board on a special \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d page \u2014 and after its 300 names, a footnote remembers former vice president Phil Rosenzweig, who\u2019d been a passenger on one of the airplanes which hit the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. The list stretches back into the 1980s, \u201cAll the way back to our first CFO Bob Smith, who died at his desk when we were a really young company,\u201d McNealy says. \u201cAnd a lot of others. That\u2019s tough.\n\n\u201cYou sit there and you look and understand that good things do come to an end.\u201d\n\nBut maybe that was one more reason to gather together and celebrate the vibrant community of former Sun Microsystems employees. \u201cIt was a big love-in. It was Woodstock\u2026\u201d McNealy says. \u201cI guess it went on until 4:30 in the morning. That\u2019s not unusual\u2026.\u201d\n\nAnd what\u2019s McNealy up to these days? \u201cI\u2019m living the dream. I still am and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d he told us this week.\n\nAnd then he added, \u201cWell, I would\u2019ve changed a couple decisions I made, but I don\u2019t fault myself\u2026 I think we made more good decisions than most companies did,\u201d he said."}, {"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/21/microsoft-senior-leadership-team-under-satya-nadella.html", "page_content": "Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith, CEO Satya Nadella, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood and Chairman John Thompson pictured at the Microsoft annual meeting of shareholders in Bellevue, Washington, on November 30, 2016. Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty Images)\n\nSatya Nadella has almost completely changed the group of top Microsoft executives who make key decisions and iron out issues since taking the company's CEO title from Steve Ballmer in 2014. Today's senior leadership team includes the leader of LinkedIn, Microsoft's biggest acquisition yet, but has no single person who's responsible for all of Windows. From the Ballmer years, only finance chief Amy Hood and legal head Brad Smith have stuck around with Nadella. In 2014, Nadella asked each person on the senior leadership team to make an \"'all in' commitment as we embark on the next chapter for the company,\" he wrote in a memo to employees. He announced at the same time that Skype executive Tony Bates, who had been a candidate for Microsoft CEO, was leaving. In the years since, a handful of other leaders have left, including Windows chief Terry Myerson, Nokia leader Stephen Elop (also once a CEO candidate) and business solutions executive Kirill Tatarinov. Most recently, artificial intelligence and research head Harry Shum left the leadership team recently after 23 years at the company, a spokesperson confirmed. But the departures haven't resulted in deep institutional knowledge going away. Eight of the 14 people on the current SLT, as the executive group is known at Microsoft, have been at the company for at least two decades. The group gathers each Friday, and meetings can span as long as seven hours, as Fast Company reported in 2017. Here are the current members of Microsoft's SLT:\n\nSatya Nadella: The boss\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella Sean Gallup | Getty Images\n\nNadella grew up in Hyderabad, India, and joined Microsoft from Sun Microsystems in 1992 as a program manager in the company's Windows developer relations group. In the years to come he worked on advertising, search, commerce and public cloud, among other areas. At one point in the early 2000s, Jeff Bezos tried to recruit him to Amazon, but then-executive Doug Burgum (now the governor of North Dakota) convinced him to stay, Burgum told Fast Company in 2017. It turned out to be a good career move. After Steve Ballmer announced plans to step down as CEO in 2013, Nadella became Microsoft's third CEO on February 4, 2014, and immediately set out transforming the company. He emphasized areas like cloud where Microsoft was a challenger rather than a leader, and formed partnerships with rivals like Red Hat and SAP. Nadella has insisted that Microsoft loves open-source software despite Microsoft's past attacks on Linux, and he has made it clear that the Windows operating system, the historical core of Microsoft, was no longer the top priority. Nadella also set about changing Microsoft's cutthroat and bureaucratic culture. He encouraged employees to have a so-called \"growth mindset\" \u2014 the belief that people can develop new skills and knowledge with enough effort \u2014 after his wife, Anu, introduced him to the book \"Mindset\" by Carol Dweck years ago. Soon after becoming CEO, he asked top Microsoft executives to read \"Nonviolent Communication\" by Marshall Rosenberg. It \"was the first clear indication that Satya was going to focus on transforming not just the business strategy but the culture as well,\" legal chief Brad Smith has said. Nadella received $42.9 million in total compensation in the 2019 fiscal year. Microsoft's independent board members recognized Nadella's efforts to improve the company's culture in the most recent fiscal year, and they felt that his engagement with customers, partners and investors was \"exceptional.\" They credited him for leading the company to record financial results. Many people have observed that Nadella is especially present when he meets with people in person. \"He has a hugely proactive and incredibly connected listening [style]. So he's with you,\" executive vice president Jean-Philippe Courtois has said. \"You can feel it. You can see the body language. And it doesn't matter if you're a top executive or a first-line seller, he has exactly the same quality of listening.\"\n\nJudson Althoff: The salesman\n\nJudson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president for worldwide commercial business, at Microsoft's 2017 Inspire conference in Washington. Microsoft\n\nAs executive vice president of Microsoft's Worldwide Commercial Business, Althoff is in charge of commercial business strategy for enterprise, public sector, small and medium-sized businesses and other areas. He joined Microsoft in 2013 from Oracle to become president of Microsoft's North American business, reporting to Microsoft's then-operating chief, Kevin Turner. Turner left in 2016, opening the way for Althoff, among others, to take more responsibility. Prior to joining Microsoft, Althoff had spent 11 years at Oracle , most recently as senior vice president for worldwide alliances and channels and embedded sales. He had worked at EMC prior to that. Althoff led the development of a major sales reorganization in 2017 that saw Microsoft go deeper in key industries like retail and health care.\n\nChris Capossela: The marketer\n\nChris Capossela, chief marketing officer of Microsoft, poses for a photograph following an early access event at the new Microsoft flagship store in London on July 9, 2019. Chris J. Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nCapossela, Microsoft's chief marketing officer and executive vice president for marketing and consumer business, wears several hats. He's in charge of Microsoft's marketing and communications, the consumer and device sales teams, along with advertising, sales and physical stores. In 1991 Capossela, known inside Microsoft as ChrisCap, graduated with a bachelor's degree from Harvard University, which Bill Gates had dropped out of in 1975, and went to work at Microsoft as a marketing manager. In the late 1990s he spent two and a half years as Bill Gates' speech assistant, and was corporate vice president for Office marketing for more than seven years, according to his LinkedIn profile. A 2011 Microsoft statement described Capossela as being \"instrumental in ushering Office into the cloud with Office Web Apps and Office 365.\" Nadella made him marketing chief in 2014. He delegated everything, one former Microsoft marketing executive told AdAge in 2014. \"Marketing at Microsoft includes building a profitable business, so understanding the flow of money is crucial,\" Capossela said in a 2014 interview.\n\nJean-Philippe Courtois: The international businessman\n\nMassimo Lapucci, right, and Jean-Philippe Courtois, left, attend a meeting between OGR and Microsoft to support startups at OGR Officine Grandi Riparazioni on Dec. 9, 2019, in Turin, Italy. Giorgio Perottino | Getty Images | OGR\n\nCourtois, known by his initials JPC, is an executive vice president and president of Microsoft global sales, marketing and operations. He heads up Microsoft's commercial business across Microsoft's many subsidiaries. He joined Microsoft as a channel sales representative in 1984, before the company's 1986 initial public offering, and in 1994 he became general manager of Microsoft France. In the early 2000s he was CEO of Microsoft's Europe, Middle East and Africa branch, then became president of Microsoft's international business until July 2016, when Kevin Turner left. Then he became executive vice president and president for global sales, marketing and operations. Courtois received $15.1 million in total compensation in the 2019 fiscal year. Microsoft board members gave him kudos for having a \"customer-obsessed\" approach and pushing for more conversations about diversity and inclusion in the most recent fiscal year.\n\nKurt DelBene: The strategist\n\nRep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, left, conducts a ceremonial swearing-in with Rep.-Elect Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., as her husband Kurt looks on in the Capitol on Nov. 13, 2012. Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call\n\nDelBene is Microsoft's chief digital officer and executive vice president of corporate strategy and the Core Services Engineering and Operations group. He looks after Microsoft's internal technology and its strategy, keeps track of competitive issues and explores potential business opportunities. He joined Microsoft in 1992 from McKinsey, where he had been a management consultant, and eventually rose to be president of Microsoft's Office division. DelBene is considered a founder of Office 365, a core part of Microsoft's modern cloud push. He was previously general manager for Outlook and group program manager for Exchange. The BBC once described DelBene as \"the man behind the PowerPoint presentations.\" In 2013 he retired from Microsoft as part of a Microsoft reorganization. Months later President Obama asked him to help fix Healthcare.gov. In 2015 DelBene returned to Microsoft on Nadella's request. He led Office when Microsoft was building the software to make Office apps work on Apple's iPad -- an initiative that Ballmer was lukewarm about, but that Nadella brought to fruition when he took over. \"It came to a point where I had discussions with Steve [Ballmer], and Steve was really kind of conflicted about it,\" DelBene said at a company event in 2015. \"He thought of us as the Windows company first and foremost, and would Office be strong if Windows wasn't strong? And my perspective was both need to be strong and Office will not be able to fundamentally be the thing that changes that equation one way or the other. But what it could do, if we didn't have cross-platform, is it could reduce the value of Office and the value proposition for Office very substantially. And so we went back and forth a couple of times. He finally said, 'Nope, I don't want to ship it.' And one of the very first things that Satya did when he became CEO is he shipped the iPad version of Office.\" In 2012 his wife, Suzan DelBene, a former Microsoft executive herself, became a U.S. representative for Washington's 1st Congressional district.\n\nScott Guthrie: The cloud chief\n\nScott Guthrie, executive vice president for Microsoft's Cloud and AI group, speaks at the company's Build conference in Seattle in May 2019. Microsoft\n\nGuthrie, known by his email handle ScottGu, is executive vice president in charge of the company's Cloud and AI group. In 2018 Guthrie gained more power when Microsoft divvied up the Windows and Devices Group and moved a good chunk of it \u2014 the Windows platform team \u2014 into his organization. He joined Microsoft immediately after taking his bachelor's degree from Duke University in 1997. He was a founding member of the team that developed Microsoft's .NET, a set of technologies for software developers to write applications. He's also the father of ASP.NET, for building web applications. For many years he has shown up at events in solid red polo shirts, the closest Microsoft comes to having a person with a regular uniform like former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who often wore black turtlenecks. In 2011 he took control of the application platform team for Azure, Microsoft's cloud infrastructure offering that competes with Amazon Web Services, to get developers building on Azure. Back then Azure was not the company's biggest priority, and it wasn't the easiest thing to use. Even some Microsoft executives had trouble with it, Business Insider reported. The day before Nadella became CEO, he asked Guthrie to take over for him as head of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise business that includes Azure. \"We've worked so closely together, so it was a pretty quick conversation,\" Guthrie said in a 2019 interview.\n\nKathleen Hogan: HR\n\nKathleen Hogan speaks at the @Work event in New York City on April 2, 2019. Cindy Ord | CNBC\n\nHogan is Microsoft's executive vice president of human resources and chief people officer. She led the charge on an overhaul of the employee performance review process. She worked on the company's paid-leave policy, and under her Microsoft has made inclusion a higher priority. She's also addressed questions about harassment complaints within the company. She earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard in 1988, according to her LinkedIn profile, then joined Microsoft from McKinsey in 2003 as vice president of customer and partner experience and worldwide field operations. She later took responsibility for technical support as well. She became chief people officer in 2014 after Nadella called her while she was on a road trip during a sabbatical and asked her to take the job. \"I think Satya really had a vision for making this a purpose-driven place and also an exceptional place for people to work, and so I thought, 'What a great chance to go do that,'\" she said in a conversation with Capossela. Hogan is Nadella's \"partner in transforming our culture,\" he wrote in his 2017 book \"Hit Refresh.\" She became a bigger supporter of Nadella after seeing how he handled criticism for saying in 2014 that women shouldn't ask for raises but instead have faith in the system. \"He didn't blame anybody,\" she said. \"He owned it. He came out to the entire company, and he said, 'We're going to learn, and we're going to get a lot smarter.'\"\n\nAmy Hood: The money master\n\nAmy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Microsoft, speaks at a climate initiative event at the company's campus in Redmond, Wash., on Jan. 16, 2020. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAs Microsoft's chief financial officer, Hood runs the finance group, giving her responsibility for acquisitions, tax planning, treasury activities, accounting, internal audits and investor relations. Hood graduated from Harvard Business School in 1999 and worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs. She joined Microsoft in 2002, initially working in the company's investor relations team. Later she was chief of staff of Microsoft's Server and Tools group, and in 2010 she became finance chief of the Microsoft Business Division. She helped lead the transition to Office 365, and oversaw the acquisitions of Skype and Yammer. When Hood stepped up to replace Peter Klein as finance chief in 2013, becoming the first woman to hold that role in company history, the strategy seemed to be less about growing revenue than cutting costs. \"Peter has built a world-class finance team, and I am set up well to continue the company's strong discipline around costs and focus on driving shareholder value,\" she said. By 2015, as executives were planning the company's briefing for financial analysts, Hood felt that the company should show investors how Microsoft could become more relevant, according to a 2017 Harvard Business School case study. At that meeting, Nadella introduced an ambitious new goal focused on growth rather than costs: The company aimed to achieve a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate from commercial cloud services including Azure, Office 365, Dynamics and enterprise mobility services in the 2018 fiscal year. Microsoft achievedthat goal. She received $20.2 million in total compensation in the 2019 fiscal year. Board members gave Hood credit for \"record year financial performance and management\" and cost cutting across multiple departments in the most recent fiscal year.\n\nRajesh Jha: The Office guru\n\nRajesh Jha, executive vice president for experiences and devices at Microsoft, speaks at the company's Build conference in Seattle in May 2019. Microsoft\n\nAs Microsoft's executive vice president of experiences and devices, Jha leads one of the major groups of engineers in the company. Most of his time at Microsoft he's worked on software for business use, and he's worked on the Office suite for many years. A 2018 reorganization gave him purview over more products, including devices and the Windows client. Jha has a say in the planning process for where Microsoft's data centers should be, alongside Scott Guthrie. Jha joined Microsoft in 1990 as a software design engineer immediately after receiving a master's degree from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. He contributed to five releases of the Microsoft Works suite and later developed multimedia technologies. \"I said, 'Wow, I can't believe they're actually trusting me to ship stuff,'\" he recalled in a 2018 conversation with Dharmesh Thakker of Battery Ventures. \"And sure enough, you know, I had some hideous bugs that went out in the first release, and I was incredibly down on myself.\" He remembered being conflicted about whether he wanted to be a developer or a manager, and he flip-flopped between the roles before his ascent to the top tiers of management at the company. \"Outside of work, you will often find me playing sports with my two sons. I am an avid sports fan and love to watch and play football, soccer, golf \u2014 sometimes more than my wife appreciates. ;),\" he wrote in a 2008 blog post. Jha speaks in bullet points, his former administrative assistant, Genise Dawson, has said.\n\nPeggy Johnson: The dealmaker\n\nPeggy Johnson, executive vice president of business development at Microsoft, speaks during the Wall Street Journal D.Live global technology conference in Laguna Beach, Calif., on Oct. 17, 2017. Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nAs executive vice president of business development, Johnson oversees Microsoft's business partnerships and corporate venture capital program, M12. She also has considerable influence on the company's M&A strategy. She was Nadella's first big hire as CEO, joining from Qualcomm. Her first assignment was to improve Microsoft's relationship with Samsung, which was upset that Microsoft had entered the smartphone space by buying Nokia in 2013. At Qualcomm she had leadership roles in engineering, sales and marketing, as well as business development. Prior to that, she had worked on anti-submarine warfare as an engineer at GE. She was one of 15 kids. Her total compensation for the 2019 fiscal year exceeded $10.4 million. Microsoft board members credited her for efforts to promote diversity and inclusion in the most recent fiscal year, noting that she helped to launch the inaugural Female Founders Competition alongside partners EQT Ventures and SVB Financial Group. \"Over the course of my career, I've spent thousands of hours in pitch meetings, often as the only woman in the room. I still can't hold back a smile when a woman founder walks through the door, because I know the obstacles she's overcome just to get there,\" she wrote in a blog post announcing the contest.\n\nKevin Scott: Technical mind\n\nKevin Scott, executive vice president and chief technology officer of Microsoft, speaks during the GeekWire Cloud Summit in Bellevue, Wash., on June 5, 2019.

He's a remote executive, and lives in Los Gatos, California, in Silicon Valley. He's typically spent a few days a week at headquarters in Redmond, Washington. \"I will in all honesty say it's not my favorite thing in the world,\" he said on a podcast in 2018. \"I've sort of been shocked that I've been able to do as much of this job as I have been able to do remotely.\" He arrived at Microsoft through the acquisition of LinkedIn, where he had been a senior vice president, and was named Microsoft's technology chief in 2017, less than two months after the acquisition closed. He reports to Nadella. Scott initially wanted to be a computer-science professor. He spent time as a summer intern at Microsoft in 2001 while working on his Ph.D. at the University of Virginia, which he did not end up completing. His Ph.D. advisor, professor Jack Davidson, spent a sabbatical at Microsoft Research at corporate headquarters and got Scott a spot as an intern on the team where he worked, the programming language systems group. He also spent time at Google and AdMob, which Google later acquired. In 2018 he said the work he was proudest of was writing \"a bunch of software that people still use, you know, to this day, to do research in this very arcane, dark alley of computer science.\"\n\nBrad Smith: The lawyer\n\nBrad Smith, president of Microsoft, right, speaks as Christopher Eisgruber, president of Princeton University, left, and Princeton Graduate Maria De La Cruz Perales Sanchez listen during a news conference outside the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. on Nov. 12, 2019. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nSmith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, regularly speaks about Microsoft's positions on government policy, immigration, intellectual property, privacy, security and sustainability. He led Microsoft's negotiations with governments and companies, including antitrust agreements, and helped Microsoft build up a large collection of patents. Smith directed Microsoft lawyers to figure out the degree to which open-source software infringed on Microsoft's patents. And he saw Microsoft's U.S. antitrust trial play out in person. He joined Microsoft in 1993 from the law firm Covington & Burling to head up European corporate and legal affairs, and he became the company's general counsel in 2002. In 2015 he was named president. He arrives at work at 6:30 a.m. and leaves at 6:45 p.m., and at 9:30 p.m. he logs on to handle work email, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. Mark Zuckerberg once tried to recruit him, but he told the young CEO that he was not interested in leaving Microsoft, the Information reported in 2018. He received $17.4 million in total compensation in the 2019 fiscal year. Board members recognized Smith's policy efforts related to the General Data Protection Regulation and the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in the most recent fiscal year. Smith has been on the Netflix board since 2015.\n\nPhil Spencer: The gamer\n\nPhil Spencer, executive vice president at Microsoft, speaks at the company's Xbox One X reveal event ahead of the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles on June 11, 2017. Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nSpencer is executive vice president for gaming, where he's in charge of gaming devices like the upcoming Xbox Series X console, as well as services like the xCloud streaming service. Spencer interned at Microsoft in 1988, two years after the company's initial public offering. After graduating from the University of Washington in 1990 he returned to Microsoft for a spot in the company's multimedia group. He led Microsoft's game studios and, later, all of Xbox. Spencer had presented Microsoft with a chance to buy Mojang, the developer of the game Minecraft, before Nadella's 2014 CEO appointment, Nadella wrote in his 2017 book \"Hit Refresh.\" Spencer's boss chose not to move forward with a deal, Nadella wrote. Spencer kept in touch with Mojang and one day received a text saying the company was again for sale. This time Spencer brought the opportunity to Nadella who by then was CEO, and Microsoft bought Mojang for $2.5 billion. He's well liked by the gaming public. He shares his online ID, P3, making it possible for people to play games like racing title Forza with him over the Xbox Live service. tweet In 2017 Spencer, Microsoft's executive vice president of gaming, joined the SLT, a sign of the company's commitment to gaming. Microsoft has bought several game-development studios under Spencer's supervision, including Compulsion Games, Double Fine Productions, InXile, Ninja Theory, Obsidian, Playground Games and Undead Labs. In November Spencer made it clear that Microsoft's buying spree is not over. \"We're running a good business today, so we've earned the right to continue to look,\" he said in an interview with Eurogamer.\n\nJeff Weiner: Socialite\n\nJeff Weiner, chief executive officer of LinkedIn Corp., speaks during a Studio 1.0 interview in San Francisco, California, U.S. Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nWeiner is CEO of LinkedIn, a social network for professionals, with more than 675 million members. But in June he'll be replaced by Ryan Roslansky, currently senior vice president of product. Weiner has more than 10 million followers on LinkedIn, and he regularly likes and comments on users' posts. And from time to time he does post, generating hundreds of comments. \"Very late to the Peloton craze (have a number of colleagues who have sworn by it for years) but have quickly become a huge fan,\" he wrote last fall. \"Absolutely nailed the value proposition.\" Before joining LinkedIn in 2008 he had held several leadership positions at Yahoo, and before that he had spent five years at Warner Bros., according to his LinkedIn profile. He was 24 when he got to Warner Bros., and he carried with him a report showing how the company could move forward in digital. \"I was just this little pisher, a nobody. But they liked the report,\" he told Forbes in 2012.

Oracle seems bent on continuing this trend with the growing Hudson open source project.\n\nOracle controls the Hudson project trademark\n\nThe Hudson open source project delivers a leading continuous integration server along with more than 300 plug-ins to support the building and testing of a wide variety of software projects.\n\n[ Keep up with the latest open source trends and news in InfoWorld's Technology: Open Source newsletter. ]\n\nThen-Sun employee Kohsuke Kawaguchi and now a key member of CloudBees, which aims to bring Hudson to the cloud, founded the Hudson project. Kawaguchi worked on Hudson as part of his Sun duties. As such, Sun, and now Oracle, retained ownership of the Hudson trademark and intellectual property.\n\nKawaguchi remains co-owner of the project, along with Winston Prakash, an Oracle engineer assigned to replace Kawaguchi after his departure from Oracle.\n\nThe tension between community and company over project decision making\n\nThe Hudson project hosted its developer and user mailing lists and source code on Java.net. However, downtime and reliability issues at Java.net encouraged the Hudson developer community to propose moving the mailing lists to Google Groups. In parallel, Oracle, also unhappy with reliability issues with Java.net, decided to upgrade the Java.net infrastructure and migrate the Hudson project to the new Java.net infrastructure.\n\nUnfortunately, an Oracle email notifying Hudson users and developers of this migration was not received as the sender was not subscribed to the mailing lists in question. As a result, Hudson developers have been locked out of the mailing lists and unable to access or update the source code for more than a week.\n\nFrustrated by the inability to access the Hudson source code, Kawaguchi proposed moving the source code to GitHub. Others supported the proposal on the developer mailing list, with no major objections raised for nearly a week. Then, Oracle's senior VP of tools and middleware, Ted Farrell, wrote the Hudson mailing list to express Oracle's concerns:"}, {"url": "https://tedium.co/2018/04/12/larry-ellison-network-computer-history/", "page_content": "Today in Tedium: Oracle has a few reasons to hate Google. The search company built a significant chunk of its empire, the Android operating system, based on Java, a programming language created by one of Oracle\u2019s largest acquisitions, Sun Microsystems. As a result, the two companies have been going at it in court for years now. Google won a few rounds, but Oracle, more importantly, won the latest, likely ensuring a Supreme Court showdown. But I wonder if this battle is a proxy war of sorts\u2014reflecting the fact that Google pulled off the big dream that Oracle once wanted for itself. Today\u2019s Tedium highlights the tale of the Network Computer, the big idea that fell out of Larry Ellison\u2019s fingers. \u2014 Ernie @ Tedium Today\u2019s GIF is Ellison from \u201cTriumph of the Nerds,\u201d talking about how much he hates Microsoft.\n\n\u201cThe NC is clearly part of our strategy to dethrone Microsoft.\u201d \u2014 Larry Ellison, speaking about the Network Computer in a 1997 interview with The Independent. Ellison was a prominent, wealthy man at the time, a guy who held a lot of power in the software industry due to Oracle\u2019s focus on relational databases\u2014products that make the business world go round, but don\u2019t necessarily make one a household name. Ellison also harbored what the article called a \u201cmonomania\u201d about Bill Gates, who always seemed to get more attention for Microsoft than Ellison did for Oracle. The Network Computer, essentially a \u201890s take on the dumb terminal, was directly inspired by his battle with Microsoft.\n\n(Oracle PR/Flickr) The Network Computer\u2019s biggest success may be in making Larry Ellison a household name When it comes down to it, Larry Ellison\u2019s big idea was one that failed to change the world until someone else tried the idea. It was a far-reaching vision that reflected the thinking of someone who knew how effective databases had gotten and how sophisticated computer networks really were, but the timing of his concept was a bit off. You could argue that there were more successful historic attempts to do what Oracle was doing elsewhere; France\u2019s Minitel comes to mind, as does the University of Illinois\u2019 PLATO system. But as a promotion strategy for Larry Ellison and Oracle, it was downright brilliant. This is not a knock on Ellison so much as simply stating fact\u2014he simply did not have much of a profile outside of the world of technology before he started making the case for the Network Computer. That idea came to prominence in direct response to the success of Microsoft, a company whose fortunes had always shone brighter in comparison to Oracle\u2019s. There was a clear reason for this, of course: Oracle worked higher up in the corporate food chain. Relational databases weren\u2019t exactly something consumers directly dealt with on a regular basis, at least with their knowledge, and Oracle couldn\u2019t exactly pull an \u201cIntel Inside\u201d with their product. Oracle was a vendor; by 1995, Microsoft was effectively a consumer business. No vendor would put a Weezer video on their installation CD. Microsoft Bob has a better ring to it than Oracle Bob. The seeds of the Network Computer started in a somewhat altruistic place. Per the 2003 book Everyone Else Must Fail: The Unvarnished Truth About Oracle and Larry Ellison, an unauthorized biography about the Oracle CEO by author Karen Southwick, Ellison had the idea in 1994 while meeting with President Bill Clinton and a number of Silicon Valley CEOs, including the heads of Sun Microsystems and Apple. He made the case that Clinton should push the computer industry to make a machine for less than $500, much as John Kennedy pushed America to go to the moon. That idea didn\u2019t win over a lot of fans, but the cheap computer idea gained momentum within Oracle after the company wed the idea to the internet, specifically the then-new World Wide Web. And it gained momentum outside of Oracle thanks to a well-timed media appearance on the part of Ellison. In September 1995, at the International Data Corp.\u2019s European IT Forum in Paris, Ellison made the case for the Network Computer concept\u2014and against the PC model, which he derided as not being a good choice for most consumers. \u201cA PC is a ridiculous device; the idea is so complicated and expensive,\u201d Ellison was quoted as saying in a ComputerWorld article. \u201cWhat the world really wants is to plug into a wall to get electronic power and plug in to get data.\u201d This was the introduction of a new vision\u2014and Bill Gates was there to defend the old one. \u201cYou\u2019ll still need a way of storing the applications that you download from the network and your personal data,\u201d Gates said at the time. Microsoft, which had just released Windows 95, had appeared to vanquish most of its enemies by this point. Apple, still without Steve Jobs, was in dire straits; IBM\u2019s PC business was a shrinking violet in the era of clones. In Paris that week, a new challenger appeared. Ellison\u2019s comments pinpointed a problem with computers\u2014they cost too much for the average person\u2014and he had a solution. He wanted to create machines that leverage the computing resources accessible through the network, rather than requiring the user to pay up front for those resources. By treating the computer as an appliance rather than a beefy machine in its own right, Ellison introduced a different image of the computer industry\u2014one that gave large players on the sidelines in the Windows era, like Oracle and Sun, a way to stand out. It was the perfect way for a guy like Larry Ellison to boost his company\u2019s name recognition.\n\n46M The number of Network Computers that Oracle Senior Director Jim Lynch suggested in 1996 that there could be on the market by the year 2000, according to an estimate by CNET. (And that was the low end of his estimate\u2014he suggested it could go as high as 100 million.) There was a lot of momentum behind the concept for a time, with Ellison\u2019s pitch winning over firms like IBM and Netscape\u2014firms that admittedly felt a little isolated by Microsoft\u2019s dominance.\n\n\u201cWe believe there will be a category of networked computers in many different forms, in portable versions and desktop versions. They will exist and they will be very successful, and not just from Sun and Oracle. The price points are going to be pretty low, and they\u2019ll look more like consumer electronics.\u201d \u2014 Eric Schmidt, then the chief scientist at Sun Microsystems and later Google\u2019s CEO and Executive Chairman, discussing the value that Sun saw in the Network Computer concept in a 1995 New York Times article that questioned whether the concept would actually work. Schmidt, as Google\u2019s chairman and CEO, would oversee a company behind the Chromebook, the closest thing we have to the Network Computer concept today."}, {"url": "http://tedchilds.com/", "page_content": "-- Keith H.

{"url": "https://www.yourtechstory.com/2021/08/03/sun-microsystems-a-famous-american-it-company-currently-operating-under-oracle-corporation/", "page_content": "Sun Microsystems is an American IT company that was established in 1982 and is based in California, US. The company became very famous over a short time because it created Java (programming language) whose applications are very wide in today\u2019s IT sector. The company mainly sold computer components, IT services, software but set itself apart by rolling out products like Java, ZFS, SPARC microprocessors, VirtualBox, etc. Sun Microsystems offers a wide range of software products like the Java platform, operating system, Office Suite, database management system, etc. It also offers storage as one of its primary products as well.\n\nAbout Sun Microsystems\n\nThe founders of Sun Microsystems are Scott McNealy, Vinod Khosla, Andy Bechtolsheim, and Bill Joy. Sun Microsystems is a company that has always supported open systems like Unix and contributed to open-source software. In 2008, the company acquired MySQL for $1 billion. After a year, Oracle Corporation announced that it would acquire Sun Microsystems for $7.4 billion. The company made plenty of acquisitions and expanded to Newark, Oregon, Scotland, Hillsboro, and many other places before it became a part of Oracle Corporation.\n\nImage source: zimbio.com\n\nHistory Of The Company And The Dot-Com Bubble\n\nThe first Unix workstation of Sun Microsystem, Sun1 is the original idea of Andy Bechtolsheim. When he was a graduate student at Stanford University, he started working on the designs of the workstation for his communications project. He designed it using the Motorola 68000 processors and an advanced memory management unit. His first design was completely built out of what he got from his college\u2019s computer science department and Silicon Valley supply houses. As the design of the workstation became a success, two other graduate students, Scott McNealy and Vinod Khosla from the same university joined in and founded Sun Microsystems. Bill Joy worked at Berkeley Software Division and joined the company soon.\n\nIn the first year of its establishment, Sun Microsystems turned out to be profitable. After four years, the company filed its first IPO under the stock symbol SUNW. This symbol was changed to JAVA in 2007 as the company became more famous as the creator of the Java platform. Soon, the situation of the dot-com bubble made an impact on every Silicon Valley business. Sun Microsystem\u2019s business rose dramatically and the share prices as well. The company started hiring more employees and building the company until the bubble burst in 2000. None of the companies were prepared for this and thus it was followed by layoffs and cost-cutting. Sun tried its best to get to the pre-cash scenario as early as possible but had to shut down their Newark, California facility.\n\nPost-Crash Scenario\n\nAfter the bubble burst, there were changes in the strategies of Sun Microsystems. The company started focusing more on processor optimization for multi-threading and multiprocessing. In 2004, the company collaborated with Fujitsu, a Japanese business, to use their processor chips and Sun servers. Eventually, Sun Microsystems stabilized itself and in 2005 gained a net profit of $19 million. The year before it was acquired by Oracle, the value of Sun Microsystems fell from 2007 to 2008 and its valuation came down to $3 billion.\n\nAcquisitions\n\nSun Microsystems has a big list of acquisitions from the year 1987 to 2009, just before Oracle acquired it. In the 1980s it acquired Transept Systems, Sitka Corp, Centrum System West, and Folio Inc. The company acquired a lot of businesses in the late 1990s. Some of them are Lighthouse Design, Encore Computer, LongView Technologies, etc. Out of all the companies it acquired, MySQL was the biggest acquisition in the company\u2019s history. Q-Layer was the last company that it acquired before Oracle bought it off.\n\nAbout The Founders\n\nScott McNealy is an alumni of Harvard and Stanford University. Mostly famous as co-founding Sun Microsystems, he also founded Curriki which is a free e-learning service. He founded Wayin in 2011 and served as its CEO for quite some time. In 2018, he joined the Advisory Board of Redis Labs.\n\nVinod Khosla is an Indian American businessman who graduated from IIT Delhi. He also went to Carnegie Mellon University followed by Stanford. Apart from Sun Microsystems, he founded Khosla Ventures. Last year, he was featured on the Forbes 400 list.\n\nApart from being an investor and an entrepreneur, Andy\u2019s career started as an electrical engineer. He was very talented as a student as he graduated from Carnegie Mellon University with the help of the Fulbright Scholarship. Later, he went to Stanford to complete his Ph.D. He is also a Google investor. Before co-founding Sun Microsystems, Bill Joy worked at Fabry\u2019s Computer Systems Research Group. He is an electrical engineer and also acquired a degree in computer science."}, {"url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/sun-microsoft-settle-java-suit/", "page_content": "Under the settlement, Microsoft will pay Sun $20 million and is permanently prohibited from using \"Java compatible\" trademarks on its products, according to Sun. Sun also gets to terminate the licensing agreement it signed with Microsoft.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft is permitted to use a version of Java in Microsoft products that already contain it, or that already are in the testing phase, for the next seven years, according to the company.\n\nJava is a software technology that allows a program to run on a multitude of computers without having to be rewritten for each one. Sun sued Microsoft for $35 million in 1997, saying Microsoft breached its contract by trying to extend Java so it would work differently, and presumably better, on Windows computers. Consequently, one of Sun's main arguments in the case was that Microsoft wrongfully advertised that its products were Java-compatible because, in Sun's eyes, they were not. Those changes broke the universality of Java, Sun argued.\n\n\"It's pretty simple: This is a victory for our licensees and consumers,\" Sun CEO Scott McNealy said in a statement. \"The community wants one Java technology: one brand, one process and one great platform. We've accomplished that, and this agreement further protects the authenticity and value of Sun's Java technology.\"\n\nMicrosoft was equally upbeat.\n\n\"This settlement is great news for the industry and Microsoft, as it means we can focus all our resources to help enable the next generation of software with Web services,\" said Sanjay Parthasarathy, vice president of platform strategy at Microsoft.\n\nShares in both companies were up in after-hours trading on the Island electronic communications network, with Sun rising from $31.56 to $32.37 and Microsoft going from $60.56 to $61.94.\n\nJava emerged in the mid-1990s and was immediately hailed as a technology that could greatly affect Microsoft's future, as it allowed developers to create desktop applications that could run on any operating system. As a result, developers ideally would not have to dedicate themselves to writing Windows programs to survive.\n\nAlthough hype outpaced actual Java implementation, the technology has steadily caught on.\n\nThe germ of the suit began when Microsoft took out a Java license in 1996. Sun contended that Microsoft quickly began to run afoul of the licensing terms and filed the initial lawsuit in October 1997.\n\n\"Microsoft has proven time and again that it is unwilling to abide by the common rules of the Internet,\" Patricia Sueltz, Sun's executive vice president for the software systems group, said in a statement. \"Its behavior with regard to the Java technology was just one instance. And when presented with the choice of compatibility or termination, Microsoft chose termination.\"\n\nIn a news conference, Sun executives said they were able to use Microsoft as a distribution tool to get Java into the hands of users when the software was in its infancy. Then Sun's lawsuit froze Microsoft's plans to modify Java for its own benefit, and Java became established in the meantime.\n\n\"I don't think we gave away anything. They're writing a check for $20 million. They're continuing to distribute an outdated version of the technology, but they can't use it for .Net,\" Sueltz said. \"All in all, it's a very good day for Sun.\"\n\nMicrosoft.Net is the company's software plan in which programs run on a multitude of servers instead of a central machine or a desktop computer. Microsoft is advocating its own Java-like language, C# (pronounced \"C-sharp\"), for the task.\n\nAnalysts say C# offers many features similar to Java. With C#, Microsoft aims to make it easier and faster for software developers to build Web-based software and services, as envisioned in the Microsoft.Net strategy.\n\nAnalysts say C# gives programmers using Microsoft's C++ and Visual Basic languages an alternative to Java. Microsoft's new language includes a universal engine that will allow software developers to use many types of programming languages to write Windows applications, analysts said.\n\nThough Microsoft may clone Java, it won't be allowed to say its products are Java-compatible.\n\n\n\nGartner analysts David Smith, Daryl Plummer and Mark Driver say enterprises should not view the recent legal settlement as an official declaration of peace between Microsoft and Sun but rather as a cease-fire on the Java legal front. see commentary\n\nMicrosoft still has power, however. Sun's Rich Green, general manager of Java Software at Sun, said the company could have prohibited Microsoft from distributing even an older version of Java. But the company chose not to because that would hurt Java programmers. In other words, they wouldn't be able to assume Windows machines had Java capability.\n\nAllowing Microsoft to ship the older version is just a crutch until the widespread distribution for the latest version is a reality. Having version 1.1.4 shipping on new Windows computers \"allows (the transition) to proceed gracefully,\" Green said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sun and IBM will continue to release the newest versions of Java for Microsoft operating systems, Sun executives said. Moving Java features to the servers instead of Web browsers has allowed Sun to advance Java despite the problems with Microsoft, they said.\n\nIronically, the Java battleground has shifted away from the desktop, where Sun and Microsoft are most fiercely pitted against each other. In the years since the lawsuit was filed, Sun has succeeded in spreading Java to servers and has begun adding it to gadgets such as Palm handheld computers and cell phones.\n\nA Microsoft representative said the dispute lingered for too long. \"We don't think anyone wins, but considering the lawsuit has been ongoing for three years, this is a good conclusion to this controversy,\" said Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan.\n\nWith the deal struck, Cullinan said Microsoft will be allowed to continue to offer its existing Java products, including its popular J++ development tool, for the next seven years. Microsoft product manager Tony Goodhew said the company will include J++ as a separate CD with the next version of Visual Studio.\n\nCullinan, however, blamed Sun for the lawsuit and maintained Microsoft's stance that Sun was trying to stop Microsoft's innovative work with Java.\n\n\"They have harmed consumers and developers by trying to reduce choice and the availability of technology,\" he said. \"They decided to go to court and try to compete on the issue.\"\n\n\"There isn't really a clear winner or loser in this settlement,\" said Gartner Group analyst David Smith, \"but when one company pays the other money, the payee has more of a legitimate claim to victory.\"\n\nSmith noted that in the long term, developers will be the ultimate winner. \"This is a cease-fire, but not peace,\" he said. \"Microsoft has been feeling increasingly strong pain for not having a Java plan.\"\n\nSmith said he believes it is unlikely that Microsoft will strike a new agreement with Sun for the latest version of Java, called J2EE. But Gartner believes that Microsoft will come around to support some of the new technologies that are part of J2EE, such as JSP (Java Server Pages) servlets, said Smith.

In the early 1990s, Ted Childs, vice-president of Workforce Diversity, proposed to CEO Lou Gerstner the creation of eight diversity task forces. Delves into the organizational and cultural impediments to starting a diversity task force initiative and how IBM overcame these obstacles to implement an effective diversity strategy. After the task forces were established, they underwent tremendous growth and became global in scope. Childs also faces the challenge of taking a U.S.-based diversity strategy and applying it to IBM's global organization.

Movies like Blank Panther and Crazy Rich Asians garnered acclaim for showing non-white stories to be complex and marketable in a historically racist industry.\n\nLike the entertainment field, the book industry has been dominated by white stories. The majority of novels read in school were written by white people about white people. In \u201cThe Windows and Mirrors of Your Child\u2019s Bookshelf,\u201d Grace Lin says that people of color lack novels that reflect themselves, or mirrors. Mirrors teach children that they are important. And without these mirrors, people of color are left feeling unvalued. Lost. But books, Lin argues, aren\u2019t only mirrors. They are also windows. Books, like windows, provide views into new, unknown worlds. They teach us not only how to respect but how to appreciate the incredible diversity that exists between us.\n\nI will admit that Lin sounds a bit patronizing at the beginning of her Ted Talk, and I chalk that down to her job as a children\u2019s book writer. But she quickly rebounded, finding herself on stage, and delivered an eloquent, meaningful talk, one that not only calls out a problem but provides an easy, immediate solution.\n\nThroughout the talk, Lin tells the story about grappling with her Taiwanese identity, unable to recognize herself in the books she read nor the mirrors she looked in. And when she mentioned auditioning for Dorothy to her friend for the school play, she was told she couldn\u2019t, because she was Asian. But eventually, when she wrote her own book, Where the Mountain Meets the Moon, children across the country wanted to be the Asian protagonist. Though what sticks with me most from the Ted Talk is words she chooses to use, specifically those used to end her talk: \u201cWhen you go home, please, look at your child\u2019s bookshelf. Are all the books mirrors, or are all of them windows? Make sure that you have both, because if you do, you\u2019re setting the path for self-worth and empathy, and that is a brick road worth following.\u201d\n\nFrom the Ted Talk, my main takeaways are the following:"}]}
