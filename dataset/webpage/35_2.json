Flanagan, Jr. is a member of the Democratic Party.": [{"url": "https://www.ualberta.ca/president/bill-flanagan-biography.html", "page_content": "Bill Flanagan became the 14th president and vice-chancellor of the University of Alberta in July 2020. Born and raised in Alberta, he has been recognized for his transformative and entrepreneurial leadership.\n\nAs soon as he was appointed, President Flanagan launched the largest and most ambitious program of academic and administrative restructuring ever undertaken by a Canadian university. With a vision for the University of Alberta for Tomorrow (UAT), he set the goal of turning the university\u2019s acute financial pressures into a strategic transformation, repositioning the U of A for long-term success.\n\nWith the creation of an entirely new and university-wide operating model, UAT dramatically enhanced the efficiency of administrative services through the establishment of shared service centres and the introduction of new technologies. By 2023, the U of A will have permanently reduced its administrative costs by $127 million annually.\n\nWith the establishment of three new colleges \u2014 the College of Social Sciences and Humanities, the College of Natural and Applied Science, and the College of Health Sciences \u2014 the university grouped 13 existing faculties into three discipline-aligned colleges, with the goal of elevating interdisciplinary teaching and research with global impacts. With a more dynamic, nimble and aligned academic structure, the university is now positioned to be an even stronger driver of economic growth, innovation and creativity in Alberta, Canada and the world.\n\nWith UAT, a significantly higher proportion of funding and resources now goes directly into classrooms and research, generating greater impact while enabling the university to more quickly and collaboratively drive international research opportunities that address the world\u2019s greatest challenges.\n\nThe transformation and associated savings achieved under UAT since 2020 are unprecedented in Canadian post-secondary history. The University of Alberta is now more sustainable, poised for ambitious enrolment growth and prepared to lead globally with purpose. Amid these profound changes, the university has continued to advance in international rankings, recently placing fifth in Canada and 92nd in the world \u2014 its best showing ever. The University of Alberta also ranked 11th globally in the 2022 Times Higher Education Impact Ranking, which assesses universities\u2019 impact in relation to the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nPrior to his appointment at the U of A, President Flanagan served as dean of law from 2005 to 2019 at Queen\u2019s University in Kingston, Ont. Through his transformative vision during his tenure, he led major initiatives elevating the delivery of education in law: the establishment of the faculty\u2019s PhD program; the founding of the Centre for Law in the Contemporary Workplace; a major expansion of the business law program; an online undergraduate Certificate in Law Program; an online Graduate Diploma in Legal Services Management, and a new online Graduate Diploma in Immigration and Citizenship Law.\n\nIn addition to his academic leadership roles, President Flanagan has an extensive record of service and engagement in the broader community. His dedicated work in support of HIV/AIDS research and initiatives has made him a well-recognized and respected public figure. He is the former chair and a current director of the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research\u2019s National Working Group and served as board chair of the AIDS Committee of Toronto \u2014 Canada\u2019s largest community-based HIV service organization \u2014 as well as on the Ontario HIV Treatment Network and Canada AIDS Russia Project. In recognition of his community service, he was named to the Honour Roll of the Ontario AIDS Network in 2011.\n\nCurrently, President Flanagan is a member of the Universities Canada Research Committee. From 2011 to 2014, he was president of the Council of Canadian Law Deans and served on the National Action Committee on Access to Justice in Civil and Family Matters.\n\nPresident Flanagan holds a BA (English and Philosophy) from Carleton University, a JD from the University of Toronto, a DEA in International Economic Law from Universit\u00e9 Paris I-Sorbonne, and an LLM from Columbia University. He joined the Faculty of Law at Queen\u2019s University in 1991, where he founded the faculty\u2019s International Law Program at the Queen\u2019s University Bader International Study Centre at Herstmonceux Castle in the U.K. His scholarly work spans property law, corporate law and international trade law.\n\nBill Flanagan is married to his husband Saffron Sri, a registered dietitian who works in the healthcare sector.\n\nBiographie de Bill Flanagan\n\nBill Flanagan est devenu le 14\u00e8me pr\u00e9sident et vice-chancelier de l'Universit\u00e9 de l'Alberta en juillet 2020. N\u00e9 et ayant grandi en Alberta, il est reconnu pour son leadership transformateur et entrepreneurial.\n\nD\u00e8s sa nomination, le pr\u00e9sident Flanagan a lanc\u00e9 le programme de restructuration acad\u00e9mique et administrative le plus important et le plus ambitieux jamais entrepris par une universit\u00e9 canadienne. Avec une vision pour l'Universit\u00e9 de l'Alberta de demain (UAD), il a fix\u00e9 l'objectif d\u2019utiliser les pressions financi\u00e8res aigu\u00ebs de l'universit\u00e9 pour effectuer une transformation strat\u00e9gique, repositionnant l'Universit\u00e9 de l\u2019Alberta pour un succ\u00e8s \u00e0 long terme.\n\nAvec la cr\u00e9ation d'un nouveau mod\u00e8le op\u00e9rationnel enti\u00e8rement nouveau et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle de l\u2019universit\u00e9, l\u2019UAD a consid\u00e9rablement am\u00e9lior\u00e9 l'efficacit\u00e9 des services administratifs en \u00e9tablissant des centres de services partag\u00e9s et en introduisant de nouvelles technologies. D'ici 2023, l'Universit\u00e9 de l\u2019Alberta aura r\u00e9duit de mani\u00e8re permanente ses co\u00fbts administratifs de 127 millions de dollars par an.\n\nAvec l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de trois nouveaux coll\u00e8ges - le Coll\u00e8ge des sciences sociales et humaines, le Coll\u00e8ge des sciences naturelles et appliqu\u00e9es et le Coll\u00e8ge des sciences de la sant\u00e9 - l'universit\u00e9 a regroup\u00e9 13 facult\u00e9s existantes en trois coll\u00e8ges align\u00e9s sur le plan disciplinaire, dans le but d'\u00e9lever l'enseignement et la recherche interdisciplinaires aux impacts mondiaux. Avec une structure acad\u00e9mique plus dynamique, agile et align\u00e9e, l'universit\u00e9 est maintenant positionn\u00e9e pour \u00eatre un moteur encore plus fort de croissance \u00e9conomique, d'innovation et de cr\u00e9ativit\u00e9 en Alberta, au Canada et dans le monde.\n\nAvec l\u2019UAD, une proportion significativement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e du financement et des ressources est d\u00e9sormais directement attribu\u00e9e aux salles de classe et \u00e0 la recherche, g\u00e9n\u00e9rant un impact plus important tout en permettant \u00e0 l'universit\u00e9 de conduire plus rapidement et de mani\u00e8re plus collaborative des opportunit\u00e9s de recherche internationales qui r\u00e9pondent aux grands d\u00e9fis du monde.\n\nLa transformation et les \u00e9conomies associ\u00e9es r\u00e9alis\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019UAD depuis 2020 sont sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dans l'histoire de l'enseignement postsecondaire canadien. L'Universit\u00e9 de l'Alberta est maintenant plus durable, pr\u00eate pour une croissance ambitieuse des inscriptions et pr\u00e9par\u00e9e \u00e0 mener avec intention au niveau mondial. Durant ces changements profonds, l'universit\u00e9 a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 progresser dans les classements internationaux, se pla\u00e7ant r\u00e9cemment au cinqui\u00e8me rang au Canada et au 92\u00e8me dans le monde - son meilleur classement jamais atteint. L'Universit\u00e9 de l'Alberta s'est \u00e9galement plac\u00e9e au 11\u00e8me rang mondial dans le classement de l'impact de l\u2019\u00e9ducation sup\u00e9rieure du Times de 2022, qui \u00e9value l'impact des universit\u00e9s par rapport aux objectifs de d\u00e9veloppement durable des Nations Unies.\n\nAvant sa nomination \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de l\u2019Alberta, le pr\u00e9sident Flanagan a \u00e9t\u00e9 doyen de la Facult\u00e9 de droit de l'Universit\u00e9 Queen's \u00e0 Kingston, en Ontario, de 2005 \u00e0 2019. Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 sa vision transformative pendant son mandat, il a dirig\u00e9 des initiatives majeures visant \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer l'enseignement du droit : la cr\u00e9ation du programme de doctorat de la facult\u00e9; la fondation du Centre pour le droit dans le milieu du travail contemporain; une importante expansion du programme de droit des affaires; un programme virtuel de certificat de premier cycle en droit; un dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures en ligne en gestion des services juridiques; et un nouveau dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures en ligne en droit de l'immigration et de la citoyennet\u00e9.\n\nEn plus de ses fonctions de leadership universitaire, le pr\u00e9sident Flanagan poss\u00e8de un vaste palmar\u00e8s de service et d'engagement dans la communaut\u00e9 plus large. Son travail d\u00e9vou\u00e9 en soutien \u00e0 la recherche sur le VIH/sida et \u00e0 des initiatives connexes l'a rendu c\u00e9l\u00e8bre et respect\u00e9 dans le domaine public. Il est l'ancien pr\u00e9sident et le directeur actuel du Groupe de travail national de la Fondation canadienne de recherche sur le sida et a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sident du conseil d'administration du Comit\u00e9 sur le sida de Toronto, la plus grande organisation de services communautaires pour le VIH du Canada. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 membre du r\u00e9seau de traitement du VIH en Ontario et du projet Sida-Canada-Russie. En reconnaissance de son service communautaire, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 au tableau d'honneur du R\u00e9seau ontarien de lutte contre le sida en 2011.\n\nPr\u00e9sentement, le pr\u00e9sident Flanagan est membre du Comit\u00e9 de recherche d'Universit\u00e9s Canada. De 2011 \u00e0 2014, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sident du Conseil des doyens de droit du Canada et a si\u00e9g\u00e9 au Comit\u00e9 d'action national sur l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice en mati\u00e8re civile et familiale.\n\nLe pr\u00e9sident Flanagan est titulaire d'un baccalaur\u00e9at en anglais et philosophie de l'Universit\u00e9 Carleton, d'un baccalaur\u00e9at en droit de l'Universit\u00e9 de Toronto, d'un DEA en droit \u00e9conomique international de l'Universit\u00e9 Paris I-Sorbonne et d'une ma\u00eetrise en droit de l'Universit\u00e9 Columbia. Il a rejoint la Facult\u00e9 de droit de l'Universit\u00e9 Queen's en 1991, o\u00f9 il a fond\u00e9 le programme de droit international au Centre d'\u00e9tudes internationales Bader de l'Universit\u00e9 Queen's, au ch\u00e2teau d'Herstmonceux, au Royaume-Uni. Ses travaux scientifiques couvrent le droit de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, le droit des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et le droit commercial international.\n\nBill Flanagan est mari\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9poux Saffron Sri, un di\u00e9t\u00e9ticien autoris\u00e9 qui travaille dans le secteur de la sant\u00e9."}, {"url": "https://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-xpm-19960513-1996-05-13-9605130049-story.html", "page_content": "Bud Flanagan isn\u2019t all business. He just sounds that way.\n\nAs he should. Adm. William J. Flanagan Jr. is commander-in-chief of Atlantic Fleet, one of the Navy\u2019s two largest commands. From his headquarters at the sprawling Norfolk Naval Base, he controls the destiny of 17 naval bases, 208 ships, 1,300 aircraft, 131,000 officers and sailors, and a $10 billion annual budget. His corporate equivalent would be the chief executive officer of the 130th-ranked Fortune 500 company.\n\nThe parallels don\u2019t stop with the figures; Flanagan brings a distinctly businesslike approach to the command. At times, he sounds more like a CEO than a senior naval officer.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to give the American public a better product for less money in the future,\u201d Flanagan says. \u201cI want us to become as efficient as we can. I want us to protect the investment that the generous American taxpayers have put in our hands.\u201d\n\nFlanagan has plenty of commander in him, too \u2013 as well as a strict sense of right and wrong that grew naturally from his father, a lifelong policeman, and strong Roman Catholic roots. When he learned in October 1995 that the Navy had kept a 95-year-old York County woman from selling a parcel of property crossed by ancient, unused Navy railroad tracks, Flanagan wasted no words.\n\nHis response: \u201cFix it today.\u201d It was.\n\nFlanagan, 53, looks both parts. Silver-haired, barrel-chested and sharp-eyed, he displays, despite a slight uneasiness at the interview process, a confident, commanding presence. Although he enjoys the trappings of his four-star position, friends say he\u2019s no martinet. In fact, they say, he is a gregarious and highly social man.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s much easier going and more down-to-earth than most flag officers,\u201d said retired Rear Adm. Maurice Bresnahan, an old school chum.\n\nThose qualities are reflected in his leadership style. Whether commanding a fleet, a ship, or overseeing the Navy\u2019s dealings with Congress, Flanagan \u201cbelieves in the family concept,\u201d said Capt. Don Nash, twice a Flanagan associate and now top assistant to the deputy commander of U.S. Atlantic Command. Flanagan, Nash said, empowers people to do their jobs while encouraging them to work as a team. \u201cHe inspires people to do more than they think they can do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNobody doubts who the boss is, but nobody feels that they are subservient to him,\u201d Nash said.\n\nWhile Flanagan may look the part, his \u201ccompany\u201d most assuredly does not. Unlike some CEOs, Flanagan doesn\u2019t produce a tangible product for market. He turns out combat-ready aircraft carrier battle groups.\n\nFlanagan has six of these. Although the ships and crews already exist, they must be maintained, trained and ready to deploy every six months on a rotating basis.\n\nAmerican taxpayers incur an enormous expense for the services provided by Flanagan\u2019s organization. Each carrier group\u2019s 18-month cycle of preparation and deployment costs $500 million.\n\nIn addition to this huge expense, Flanagan must do as much as his predecessors with less; post-Cold War reductions have shrunk his fleet, but the Navy\u2019s deployment schedule hasn\u2019t changed. Those realities make Flanagan look hard at shaving costs and making his vast operation more efficient.\n\nFlanagan, a Harvard Business School graduate, has a strong affinity for concepts such as efficiency. \u201cMy view is that there\u2019s a lot of principles involved in the business world that we need to employ,\u201d he says.\n\nEfficiency is spelled two ways for Flanagan. One is at it is applied to the art of warfighting, practiced at its highest level.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to bring this force somewhere to employ it in anger, it\u2019s got to be able to do so at a very, very high rate of efficiency, and bring all our people home,\u201d Flanagan said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the goal.\u201d\n\nThe other efficiency is strictly monetary. The fleet\u2019s $10 billion budget and increasing pressure to reduce federal spending demand that money be saved wherever possible.\n\nBut while fiscal thriftiness has a strong appeal for Flanagan, he says it also produces benefits for the operational commanders who receive his forces.\n\n\u201cThe efficiencies that we\u2019re able to realize will be passed on to these operational commanders in terms of force availability,\u201d Flanagan says. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s critical.\u201d\n\nTo realize the savings, Flanagan said, the fleet is taking a fresh look at its accounting practices \u2013 the means it uses to calculate the \u201ccost of goods sold.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe know now what those are,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of building a management accounting system to better account for what it is we spend and how it is we spend it.\n\n\u201cI think those are two very key things.\u201d\n\nFlanagan is also saving money through more efficient management of his floating assets. His ships, unless laid up for extended maintenance, must spend six months of each 18-month cycle on overseas deployments to the Mediterranean. But Atlantic Fleet ships also patrol the Caribbean Sea and points further south, and conduct joint operations with allies in that region.\n\nFlanagan, who was 2nd Fleet commander prior to assuming the top job at Atlantic Fleet, realized that about 25 percent of his available forces were at any given time required to be at sea for Caribbean duty. So, he reasoned, \u201cwhy don\u2019t we build a force that operates exclusively in this region?\u201d\n\nBy doing so, Flanagan said, the operators of those ships would become experts on the regional mission instead of spending additional time being trained for every possible contingency the Atlantic Fleet could face, the standard for ships preparing for Med cruises.\n\nThe result of that sort of thinking was the formation of the Western Hemisphere Group, a group of selected ships based in Mayport, Fla., that operates solely in Caribbean and South Atlantic waters.\n\n\u201cI think that we improved the product, and I think that we did it at less cost,\u201d Flanagan said.\n\nIn addition, Flanagan, along with his Pacific Fleet counterpart, Adm. Ronald J. Zlatoper, has created a fleetwide, money-saving training schedule for ships preparing to go overseas. By keeping his ships near the U.S. coast instead of sailing to the Caribbean for the third and final phase of their training, Flanagan shaves 3,000 miles off each ship\u2019s round trip and cuts the time spent doing such training in half.\n\nFlanagan and Zlatoper have also combined efforts to streamline the two organizations\u2019 training and operational procedures. Over the years, the two fleets, one based in Norfolk, the other in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, had developed into distinct and separate cultures \u2013 so much so that, according to Zlatoper aide Capt. Steve Clawson, ships from the two fleets meeting at sea could not, as recently as 15 years ago, effectively communicate or work together.\n\nNow, that\u2019s changing. \u201cWe decided that we would work together,\u201d Zlatoper said recently. \u201cOur predecessors started working to coordinate the two fleets, and we\u2019ve continued that.\u201d\n\nZlatoper gives Flanagan much of the credit for making the project a success. \u201cFrom my estimation, he has really brought the flag officers of the surface fleet together better than anyone in my memory,\u201d Zlatoper said.\n\nFlanagan could also gain future savings for his fleet by way of a previously proposed project that, although it remains in the planning stages, could have significant impact on Hampton Roads.\n\nFlanagan wants to combine public and private transportation assets to make the region a highly effective launching pad for massive numbers of troops en route to an overseas crisis. This \u201cintermodal transportation system\u201d would combine highway, rail, and port operations in a manner that would serve both military and commercial needs more efficiently.\n\nIn one example of cost-sharing, Flanagan would provide easements to Norfolk Naval Base property to allow the adjacent Norfolk International Terminal to expand its commercial operations. At the same time, NIT would take on the Navy\u2019s cargo-handling operation, saving tax dollars.\n\n\u201cThe way I\u2019m looking at it is, how can we do something that\u2019ll benefit the military, and as a result benefit the United States, in terms of being able to mobilize if we have to with the greatest efficiency \u2026 at the same time, how can all of this benefit the community?\u201d Flanagan said.\n\nThis sort of thinking is what has attracted the attention of the region\u2019s business, civic and government leaders, who have included Flanagan on the organizing committee for the Hampton Roads Public/Private Partnership, a new group being organized in hopes of improving regional cooperation on economic issues. Flanagan says that given the Navy\u2019s size here, that\u2019s as it should be.\n\n\u201cThe Navy puts about $11 billion a year in this economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a significant contribution, and it makes us the largest contributor of anyone in this region.\u201d\n\nDespite his drive to maximize potential and efficiency, Flanagan takes the time to listen.\n\nHe says he believes in a workplace where honest dissent from the party line can be expressed without fear of retribution. His leadership style is deliberate, and stems from a sense of purpose that others say Flanagan possessed even as a young man.\n\n\u201cHe was always focused,\u201d said Neil Nightingale, chief of police in the Cape Cod town of Barnstable, where Flanagan grew up. \u201cHe always knew where he wanted to go.\u201d Nightingale worked for Flanagan\u2019s father, the former deputy chief, from whom the son inherited the nickname \u201cBud.\u201d\n\nNightingale remembers the younger Flanagan as \u201calways well-behaved and polite. He was not a rowdy \u2026 he was always a straight arrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew he was destined for big things,\u201d said George Gillis, a friend and classmate of Flanagan\u2019s at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy in nearby Buzzard\u2019s Bay. \u201cHe was so personable, so disciplined, so dedicated. When he wanted something, he got it.\u201d\n\nFlanagan spent some of his youthful summers caddying at a golf club frequented by the Kennedy clan. But in addition to walking the greens, he, like many other Cape Cod youths, worked on lobster and fishing boats. Both of his grandfathers were sea captains. Life at sea intrigued him.\n\nAt the maritime academy, Flanagan lived on a ship; dormitories weren\u2019t then an option. \u201cWe did every single job a sailor does on a ship,\u201d said Bresnahan, now the assistant to the academy president. \u201cThat stood me in good stead, and I\u2019m sure it did Bud Flanagan.\u201d\n\nThe course work didn\u2019t come easy. \u201cWe had a tough regimen here, and he struggled like the rest of us,\u201d Bresnahan said. \u201cAcademically. It\u2019s a tough school. It didn\u2019t come easy.\u201d\n\nIn 1964, Flanagan graduated and set forth, armed with a degree in marine transportation and a 3rd Class Coast Guard license. While some of his classmates began their Navy careers, Flanagan chose to follow in the footsteps of his grandfathers and join the U.S. Merchant Marine. He served three years, sailing with American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines out of New York.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. involvement in Vietnam had grown from an advisory role to full-blown war. In 1967, Flanagan accepted a full Naval commission and sailed west. He served on two ships during that war, and hasn\u2019t looked back to civilian life.\n\nFlanagan was selected to be the 1973-74 Chief of Naval Operations Fellow, serving under Admirals Elmo R. Zumwalt and James L. Holloway III. In 1975, he commanded his first ship, USS Bronstein. In 1979, at age 35, he was named one of the U.S. Jaycees\u2019 Ten Outstanding Young Americans \u2013 along with Vietnam War hero and Pittsburgh Steelers running back \u201cRocky\u201d Bleier, and Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton.\n\nThe following year, he began a three-year hitch as the first commander of the USS Kidd, a new class of guided missile destroyer. In 1988 \u2013 his 19th year of service \u2013 Flanagan was selected for promotion to rear admiral. He subsequently served as commander of Destroyer Squadron Five in San Diego and of the Norfolk-based Second Fleet. In October 1994, he assumed his present command, and donned his fourth star.\n\nFlanagan\u2019s meteoric rise through the ranks makes some think he\u2019s a logical candidate to rise even higher in the U.S. military hierarchy. But Flanagan downplays such possibilities, refuses to speculate on the future, and says he\u2019s focused on his present work.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to use this as a springboard to some other opportunity,\u201d Flanagan says he has repeatedly told his staff, \u201cbut rather, just to make sure that we got this done as well as we could.\u201d\n\nTHE FLANAGAN LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY\n\n1. Add wisdom from the top down. \u201cIn other words, if you know something, and obviously you do, because you\u2019re in a senior position, then you\u2019ve got to share that with your subordinates. When it comes time for them to take your position, they\u2019ll do it not as well, but better than you.\u201d\n\n2. Take fear out of the workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sin to make a mistake. We learn from them. It\u2019s an attitude that if we approach this with openness, and goodwill, and moral purpose, we\u2019ll get improvement.\u201d\n\n3. You\u2019ve got to have optimism. \u201cThe fleet\u2019s as big as the fleet is right now. It\u2019s the best fleet we\u2019ve got. I\u2019ve never heard a man win a fight that went into it thinking he was going to lose. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to lose anything, and we all need to think that way. We have a new Navy that\u2019s restructured, and that\u2019s important to have confidence in, and to build on.\u201d\n\nADM. WILLIAM J.
