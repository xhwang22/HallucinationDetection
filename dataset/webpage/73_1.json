{"John Loder was one of the pioneers of the British recording industry, and was responsible for the production of some of the earliest British recordings.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/19/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries", "page_content": "I first met the sound engineer and record producer John Loder in about 1968. He was on an acid trip and seemed to be talking out of the top of his head. The next time I met him he was straight and made a lot more sense. We soon found that we shared. a common interest in Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, John Coltrane, and KarlHeinz Stockhausen. When we got bored with them, we would play birdsong forwards and Bach backwards.\n\nBy 1970 John, who has died aged 59, and I were working together in Exit, an avant-garde outfit. I was the percussionist, playing an amplified bicycle wheel, and he was using an ancient one-track tape-recorder discovered in a friend's attic; primitive, but it was the beginning of what was to become John's lifework.\n\nFinanced by a brief spell as a mini-cab driver, by 1972 John had cobbled together an innovatory multi-track sound system, first used as a part of the wildly ambitious avant-garde International Carnival of Experimental Sound (ICES 72). By the time Exit disbanded in 1974, John had accumulated enough equipment to build a recording studio in the small garage of his north London home.\n\nDuring the next three years we lost touch, but by 1977 he was recording advertising jingles - which he didn't enjoy - and I had cofounded the band Crass, which I enjoyed thoroughly. From then on the ball started to rock and roll. As \"the ninth member of the band\", John became our recording engineer and financial manager: the music was bad and so was the money, but it was fun.\n\nWithin a couple of years Crass albums were dominating the alternative charts, and John's garage had become Southern Studios. In 1979 we created Crass Records and, despite marketing our first single for 45p against John's warning that every copy would lose us 3p, we made money.\n\nWe were in business, and from the outset it was clear that the music industry was not well pleased; John was a maverick, a DIY champion who didn't play the game. In his philosophy, beautiful came before big: to the last he drove a wreck of an old van, and never considered moving his garage studio to a more \"desirable\" location.\n\nLikewise, attempts to buy him out failed, just as media attempts to denigrate Crass had no effect on its growing popularity. Crass Records became the label that every aspiring punk band looked to, Southern Studios their destination, and John their engineer of choice.\n\nThroughout that time, with scores of bands being released on the label, no contract was ever signed and no paperwork ever thrust in faces. It was all done on trust, a principle that John held dear throughout his life. And it was John's managerial, production and engineering skills which were to assist the likes of Crass, Bjork, Chumbawamba, Fugazi, Shellac, The Jesus And Mary Chain, Slint and Babes In Toyland into the public domain,\n\nBorn near Plymouth, educated at a boarding school that he didn't like, John studied electrical engineering at London's City University. Details of his early history are brief because he didn't like talking about himself. John was one of those people who appears to have been born on their 20th birthday.\n\nFor every band that made it on to Crass Records, 10 were turned away. Crass's ideology was uncompromising and, as John felt, many good bands were losing the chance of public exposure. As a response, in partnership with his artist wife Sue, he created several labels and Southern Distribution, to ensure that they found a market. Aided by a small team to whom John was devoted, Southern grew into the international force that it is today.\n\nJohn resisted many attempts over the years to rein him in; as other independents collapsed, Southern survived, as majors conglomerated and became increasingly bland, Southern remained a vibrant voice in the wilderness. When bands got too big for their boots or managers began to burn his ears, John would suggest they go elsewhere. In the truest sense, Southern was a cottage industry, it placed people before profit.\n\nMedia requests for interviews with John always drew a blank, he displayed a reticence which extended even to his closest friends. For that reason very few people were aware that during the last 18 months he had been battling with a brain tumour which finally killed him.\n\nBut just as John's studio has become legendary, so has his insistence that quality of product should come before quantity: his angle, small is beautiful, was the big idea.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sue, and daughter, Natasha.\n\n\u00b7 John Loder, record producer, born April 7 1946; died August 12 2005."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-loder-mn0000238526/biography", "page_content": "Producer and engineer John Loder founded the landmark Southern Studios and its accompanying record label and distribution network, all potent forces in the emergence and continued longevity of post-punk. Born April 7, 1946, outside of Plymouth, England, Loder briefly studied electrical engineering at London's City University, but music was his obsession -- in particular experimental and avant-garde recordings -- and in 1970 he began collaborating with the avant outfit Exit. With earnings saved from a short tenure driving a taxi, by 1972 Loder had assembled his own multi-track sound system, and two years later opened a recording studio in the garage of his North London home.\n\nHe spent the mid-'70s writing and recording advertising jingles, but in 1977 crossed paths with fellow Exit alum Penny Rimbaud, who in the interim co-founded the punk group Crass. Soon Loder was installed as the band's recording engineer and financial adviser, and with a few additional improvements his garage was officially opened as Southern Studios. With Rimbaud, he also founded Crass Records, and the staunch D.I.Y. ethics of studio and label alike -- no contracts or paperwork, just handshake deals and mutual trust -- earned enormous respect from punk artists and fans.\n\nOver the years to follow, Loder created several additional labels and also Southern Distribution to ensure a home and retail channels for worthy bands that might otherwise go unnoticed. His production and managerial portfolio ultimately swelled to include a who's who of underground acts including Bj\u00f6rk, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Fugazi, Shellac, and Slint, and despite the music industry's trend towards consolidation, the Southern empire remained as fiercely independent as its owner. After battling a brain tumor, Loder died August 12, 2005, at the age of 59."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/musicians-of-bath-and-beyond-edward-loder-18091865-and-his-family/master-violinist-and-teacher-john-david-loder-17881846/8D37CD74370D3DC2B5492EBF8EE53931", "page_content": "These are merely the chest of tools \u2013 it is the master who must direct the employment of them.\n\nTHE biography of J. D. Loder (1788\u20131846) is already relatively familiar or readily available to those interested in nineteenth-century British music, and other contributors to this volume have provided valuable further details and insights. Therefore it should be sufficient merely to remind ourselves briefly of the orphaned child prodigy, son of a Bath-based violinist, who became hugely celebrated as a violinist and leader in his home city; became the first Englishman to lead the orchestra of the Philharmonic Society of London; established himself as a music publisher in Bath; became a professor of violin at the RAM; succeeded Franz Cramer as leader of the Ancient Concerts; played viola in Dando's Quartet Concerts; wrote important pedagogical texts for the violin published into the twentieth century; and was the father of the twins John Fawcett Loder, who also became prominent in Bath and London as a violinist, teacher and concert manager, and the composer Edward James Loder.\n\nJohn David Loder was engaged in activities at the highest professional level and represents a very rare breed: a native instrumentalist with a superb pedigree as both a performer and pedagogue. Reaching this level as a violinist is even more noteworthy. He managed to achieve a status and legacy beyond his own lifetime, an achievement reserved in Britain, as a rule, for prominent foreign figures. The circumstances of his success and rise to prominence provide a unique case study within the complex fabric of British music and instrumental performance and pedagogy in the nineteenth century.\n\n\u2767 An English Musician of Eminence\n\nThe brief synopsis of John David's life given above would certainly support the assertion that Loder achieved a position of eminence during his lifetime. Taking a broad perspective, British violinists, like most of their instrumentalist colleagues, had long struggled to compete with the more exotic and often more competent foreign masters. Even relatively prominent players were not qualified to stand alongside and compete, as leaders and soloists, with the likes of Giardini, W. Cramer, Barth\u00e9lemon and Salomon. Happily, the nineteenth century brought some improvement in the achievements and fortunes of native violinists, following the emergence of more enlightened attitudes and greater opportunities."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/john.loder/2225712", "page_content": "John Loder\n\nengineer audio engineer\n\nApril 7, 1946 (age 59) Plymouth, Montserrat\n\nHe was also the studio engineer of choice for Crass Records, and was often considered to be the band\"s \"ninth member\".

He showed me the potential for getting the most out of the equipment without making the equipment the focus of attention.

He was at the head of his profession in Bath for many years, leading the band of the theatre, and giving concerts in association with Sir George Smart from 1823, and others. After 1826, when Loder was soloist at the Gloucester musical festival, he was leader at the Three Choirs festivals until 1845. He subsequently resided in London, became professor of the Royal Academy of Music, and a principal violin, 1840, succeeding Cramer as leader, 1845, at the Ancient Concerts. Loder also led at the Philharmonic and other concerts. His thorough knowledge of orchestral and chamber music caused his services to be especially sought in the performance of new and intricate works. He was a successful teacher of the violin and viola, and the author of a standard work of instruction for the violin, 1814, one more elementary than the foreign class-books hitherto employed, and more methodical than the compilations of Geminiani and Barth\u00e9l\u00e9mon. The 'Instruction Book' passed through many editions, one of the most recent being edited by Carrodus in 1884.\n\nLoder died at Albany Street, Regent's Park, on 13 Feb. 1846, in his fifty-eighth year. He left a widow, five sons\u2014of whom three, Edward James [q. v.], John Fawcett, and William, were established musicians\u2014 and two daughters.\n\nLoder supplemented his (1) 'General and Comprehensive Instruction Book for the Violin,' 1814, by (2) 'A First Set of Three Duets for two Violins,' 1837, and (3) 'The whole Modern Art of Bowing,' 1842.\n\nLoder's second son, John Fawcett Loder (1812-1853), violinist, born in 1812, played in London orchestras.
