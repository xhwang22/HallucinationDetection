At that point the likes of Blackpool, Motherwell, Partick Thistle and St Mirren were vying for his signature, but the 19-year-old's mother was so impressed by the honest approach of the Aberdeen manager David Halliday that the boy heeded her advice to head north-east from his Lanarkshire home to enlist with the Dons.\n\nBaird, who had starred for Strathclyde Juniors alongside the future Rangers luminary Willie Waddell, was an intelligent fellow who nursed ambitions to be an architect, but his football skills had proved impossible to ignore and now he planned to train in the mornings and study for his future career in the afternoons. However, he made a slow start at Pittodrie, struggling for an impact in this new competitive environment, and he was still featuring for the reserves when war broke out in 1939.\n\nNow, all too soon, the youngster who had viewed joining the Dons as a great adventure was to find himself caught up in an expedition of an altogether more daunting nature, one on which failure surely must have carried fatal consequences.\n\nWhile serving in the medical corps for the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, he missed the evacuation at Dunkirk but managed to board the last ship out of St Nazaire when France fell in summer 1940. Awaiting his return to the war, Baird was stationed at Headingley, Yorkshire's cricket headquarters, and while he was there he guested for Leeds United, facing top performers of the day such as the Everton trio Tommy Lawton, Joe Mercer and Cliff Britton.\n\nThe respite was brief, though, and he was dispatched to North Africa, where he was part of the force which confronted Rommel in the Western Desert. When Tobruk was taken in the summer of 1942, his field ambulance was surrounded by German tanks and he was captured and handed over to the Italians, who placed him in a prisoner-of-war camp near Rimini on the Adriatic coast.\n\nMany of his fellow detainees died in what he described later as \"a filthy hell-hole\" but Baird, who whiled away some of his time by day-dreaming about his life as a footballer, remained resilient and in 1943, after 18 months of incarceration, he and a comrade, Harold Smith, managed to escape. Knowing that the Allies had landed in Italy, and aiming to join them, the pair headed south into the lower reaches of the Appenines. They lived off the land, helped on their way by sympathetic Italian farmers, and when severe winter weather set in Baird was sheltered for some months by a compassionate family, the Pilottis, who found other safe billetts for Smith and another fugitive who had joined the pair on their trek towards freedom.\n\nWith his sharp and lively mind, Baird picked up Italian quickly, enabling him to pose convincingly as the son of his courageous benefactors, to whom he became devoted and with whom he embarked on a lifelong friendship. \"They were real heroes,\" he said years later. \"They looked after me despite knowing the Germans would have shot them if they had found out.\"\n\nEventually, as Hitler's forces pulled out of Italy, Baird rejoined the Allied ranks and returned to Britain, guesting as a footballer for Aldershot and non-League Falmouth before returning to Aberdeen following his demob in September 1945. Vastly matured by his recent experiences, he was now a far more confident character than the tentative youth he had been during his initial Pittodrie sojourn, and he became established rapidly in the Dons' first team.\n\nOperating as an incisive prompter alongside his close pal and fellow inside-forward George Hamilton and the diminutive spearhead Stan Williams, Baird proved hugely influential as Aberdeen won the Southern League Cup, an emergency wartime competition and the precursor to the soon-to-be-launched Scottish League Cup. They beat Rangers 3-2 in a see-sawing final in front of 135,000 fans at Hampden Park in May 1946 to claim the first big prize since the club's formation in 1903.\n\nThere was reward on a wider front, too, with an appearance for Scotland in the Victory international against Belgium that January, the game finishing 2-2. Because it was classed as an unofficial wartime encounter, no cap was awarded, and that proved to be his sole outing for his country. He was immensely unfortunate because he had excelled against the Belgians, keeping his feet deftly in thick snow on a foggy Hampden afternoon, and had been selected for the next fixture, against England, only to be forced out through injury.\n\nA season later Baird was prominent again as the Dons beat highly-fancied Hibernian 2-1 to win the Scottish Cup, thus securing their first senior trophy and emphasising the progress they had made in finishing third in that term's title race behind Rangers and Hibs. They reached the inaugural League Cup final, too, losing 4-0 to Rangers, and faced the future on a tide of optimism.\n\nBaird, with his clever passing, neat ball skill and happy knack of contributing important goals, was seen as a major plank of Halliday's entertaining side, but he was hampered cruelly by knee problems which demanded three operations, and also he suffered a fractured leg. His best extended run was in 1950-51, when he scored 10 times in 40 league and cup appearances, but after barely figuring in 1952-53, the 34-year-old \u2013 whose overall record of 37 goals in 144 games for Aberdeen would have been far more extensive had he been blessed with fitness on a consistent basis \u2013 accepted a transfer to second-tier St Johnstone.\n\nAt McDiarmid Park Baird enjoyed a fruitful Indian summer, moving back to wing-half and missing only a handful of matches as the Saints twice finished in upper mid-table, then narrowly missed promotion to the top flight in 1955-56, his last campaign.\n\nAfter leaving the game, Baird \u2013 who until his death was believed to be Aberdeen's oldest surviving player \u2013 embarked on a fulfilling and packed life as a sports writer for the Scottish Sunday Express and a PE teacher who rose to become assistant head of Hilton Academy in Aberdeen by the time he retired in 1979. Somehow he even chiselled out the necessary time from his crowded schedule to qualify as a glider pilot.\n\nBaird believed passionately in education, achieving degrees in English and Italian through the University of London by correspondence course in the 1960s then teaching his second language at evening class. A warm, gregarious and charming man who had come to love all things Italian, he moved to Italy for a year from 1980, along with his wife Nancy, to teach English there.\n\nHis attachment to journalism was equally deep \u2013 many of his family members were practitioners, including his brother-in-law Magnus Magnusson and Magnusson's daughter Sally \u2013 and he became a popular columnist on the Aberdeen-based monthly magazine Leopard.\n\nArchie Baird was an author, too, penning a moving autobiography, Family Of Four (1989). It was a book in which his love of football was abundantly evident, but which illustrated eloquently his appreciation of its rightful place when he came to consider the more profound values of life.\n\nIvan Ponting\n\nArchibald MacKechnie Baird, footballer, journalist and teacher; born Rutherglen, Lanarkshire 8 May 1919; played for Aberdeen 1938-53, St Johnstone 1953-56; marriedn (one son, one daughter); died Cove, Aberdeen 3 November 2009."}, {"url": "https://www.afcheritage.org/Team/CurrentSquad/player_show.cfm?player_id=66&Season=1952-53", "page_content": "Inside forward Baird joined the Dons in 1938 but had a long wait to make his Aberdeen debut due to the war. Scored in the Dons first national triumph in the 3-2 Southern League Cup win against Rangers in 1946. Was also a vital part of the Dons successful Scottish Cup side a year later. Represented Scotland in wartime internationals, Archie Baird joined St Johnstone at the end of the 1952-53 season.\n\nAnother link with this football club's past was lost forever on the 4th November 2009, with the sad news that former player and Aberdeen legend, Archie Baird, has passed away. However his memory will always live on at Aberdeen Football Club. Whenever the Scottish Cup comes around, talk will be of the side that carried off the crown in 1947, for the very first time, and Archie Baird's role in it. That will never die.\n\nArchie Baird Interview taken from Red Matchday earlier this year\n\nBeing the oldest known living former Don was not a burden that would have worried Archie Baird; after all he has been through some incredible experiences in what has been a memorable playing career and personal life. Archie had celebrated his 90th birthday on the 8th May and was the only surviving Don from the team that won the Dons first Scottish Cup in 1947.\n\nBorn in Rutherglen, Archie joined Aberdeen as a youngster of great promise in the summer of 1938. Aberdeen offered Archie a two-year contract which was unusual back then for any young player to be rewarded with more than a year's contract. \"I had offers from Blackpool, Motherwell, St Mirren, Partick and others but my mother influenced my final decision due to the fact that Aberdeen manager Dave Halliday had good, honest eyes that were what clinched my move to Aberdeen. I had always admired the Dons and their style and moving to Aberdeen was a clean break. It all happened so quickly; six months after starting as a Junior I was away to Aberdeen and earning \u00a34 per week with a \u00a320 signing on fee. I set out on my great adventure in July 1938 leaving Buchanan Street station in Glasgow in the company of someone called Willie Waddell but not my right wing buddie from Strathclyde. By a strange coincidence there was another young player of that name with Renfrew and he too had just signed for Aberdeen. Willie was a fine player and we grew to become close friends for many years.\"\n\nArchie soon began to realise what being at a football club like Aberdeen was all about as he started out in the reserves. \"We got a taste of full-time training the month before the start of the season. Donald Colman was the trainer at that time; a quiet-spoken intelligent man. He made an immediate impression on me. When he entered the dressing room you could sense he had the respect of the hard-bitten pros. Donald was detailed in everything he did and that rubbed off on the players. He would advise players on their fitness and diet and the importance of living healthy. He was ahead of his time. He also got the best out of players and that was his real strength. Matt Armstrong was struggling to make it at Celtic but Colman transformed him at Pittodrie and he went on to become one of the best forwards ever to play for the Dons. I soon began to realise that I would turn to Donald for guidance as my form began to suffer and I lost confidence. I saw my friend Willie Waddell promoted to the first team and I was delighted for him but things were not going well for me and I was struggling to make an impact.\"\n\nIt was at that point that events in Europe were soon to have an impact on the whole country as Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939. All football was immediately stopped as every attention turned to the war effort. Events during those difficult times would have a huge bearing on Archie. \"It all happened so quickly. Here I was in Aberdeen and trying to make my way as a professional player and also training to be an architect. A couple of months later I was conscripted and was very soon in France as a member of a medical corps unit with the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force. I missed the evacuation of Dunkirk, and only managed to leave France on the last ship out of St Nazaire. That was in the summer of 1940. By Christmas I was in the Western Desert, and by May 1942 had been captured by the Germans near Tobruk and handed over to the Italians. It was at El Adem when our field ambulance attached to the infantry unit had been surrounded by a squadron of German tanks. We ended up in a camp near Tripoli, called Suani Ben Adem. It was a filthy hell-hole, a huge rectangular strip of oasis surrounded by a wire fence and sentry towers. Prisoners were unable to do anything and many died there. What an eternity those four years seemed and how different from my teenage dreams; my twenty-first birthday spent in a tent 'somewhere in France'; my football confined to games for the unit team, a kick about with the lads and the occasional improvised training session. Since the war broke out I had played only two first class games, both with Leeds United as a guest player while I was stationed at Headingly Cricket Ground awaiting transfer to Egypt. Lying there under the clear Italian sky, I relived the excitement of playing against the pre-war Everton stars; Jones, Britton, Mercer and the great Tommy Lawton. But not even the good memory of scoring a goal for Leeds that day could make me forget the seriousness of my situation.\"\n\nArchie spent much of his time during the hostilities as a POW in Italy but it was his story of what happened after his escape that was truly a tale of human courage and compassion. After eighteen months as a captive, Archie and his close friend Harold 'Smudger' Smith escaped to the foothills of the Appenines, free, but still in enemy-occupied territory. They headed south after news of an Allied landing on the Italian coast suggested that would have been their best route. However the journey was an arduous one with German patrols prominent. Their route to safety was achieved by living off the land and the generosity of sympathetic Italian farmers and peasants they met along the way.\n\n\"We had encountered many dangers along the way but the local Italian people were humble, generous people.\"\n\nIt was on that long trek to freedom that Archie came across an Italian family that would go to 'adopt' him as one of their own for several months as the harsh winter set in. The Pilotti family were Italian farmers who looked after Archie as his good friend Harold and Tom who had joined them along the way, found similar families nearby to home the escapees. Archie made life-long friendships during those days and daily news of Allied advances helped raise spirits. Archie also by his association with his new friends managed to speak the language in time. As the German occupation waned by the day and news of the Allied efforts in Italy were successful.\n\n\"As we made our way to eventual freedom we could hear gunfire in the distance. The Germans were retreating north and their convoy was an easy target for our fighters and bombers. The activity in the air was increasing as we made our way north. We eventually arrived in a village called Sarnano where it was soon to become Allied occupied territory, my feelings were mixed as the Italian people did not really understand what was happening as the Union flag was raised in their town.\n\n\"I came back a completely different person. I went away as a raw young laddie and came back after experiencing a lot, I had more confidence in myself and as far as football was concerned I was thrust straight into the Aberdeen first team so it just developed from there. On my return to Falmouth I had started playing for my unit team and for Aldershot. By early 1945 I was stationed at Edinburgh Castle and playing for Aberdeen when I could get leave arranged. The Scottish Command then selected me for a tour of Orkney Islands and I met up with some players I would face in the coming months. However the most important day for me was stepping out at Pittodrie to face Hearts for the first time in seven years and I was at last, making my first team debut. The war ended in May 1945 and I was demobbed in September.\"\n\nIt was in January 1946 that Archie gained his one Scotland cap when he played against Belgium at Hampden. \"That game should never have been played as the ground was covered in snow. The game ended in a 2-2 draw but the thick fog made conditions all the more difficult. Jimmy Delaney and Gordon Smith were alongside me in that side. It was not an ideal international to play in but the Victory International against England was something else. It was the last wartime international and was seen as a celebration of the end of hostilities. I was delighted to be selected for the Scotland team. I would be facing some famous names like Frank Swift, Len Shackleton and Billy Wright. The Saturday before the international we were playing Partick at Firhill. I went down in a tackle with Jacky husband and I knew at once that I was seriously injured. On the Monday I had to call off from the Scotland team as the injury worsened. It was a sad day for me although my team mate George Hamilton took my place.\"\n\nThe highlights of Archie's Pittodrie career came in the Dons Southern League Cup win in May 1946 and the Scottish Cup a year later.\n\n\"I had a month to recover from that injury to make it for the final against Rangers. We prepared in Largs for three days before the game and we also had to contend with the butt of all jokes as Aberdeen had never won a national trophy at that time. The game was a real highlight for me personally as I scored a goal in the opening minute. Andy Cowie sent in a long throw and George (Hamilton) flicked the ball on with his head. I managed to leap past George Young to score. When Stan Williams scored just before half time, the big Aberdeen contingent was convinced we had done enough. Rangers back though and the game was tied at 2-2 as we moved into the final minutes. In the last seconds George Taylor popped up with a sensational winner and the cup was ours.\n\n\"A year later we took the Scottish Cup as well after beating Hibernian. There was a huge Aberdeen following that day as supporters came from all over, as far away as Orkney and Shetland; a true north east invasion. It was an amazing experience and after we lost a goal in the opening minute we came back to win with Stan Williams scoring the winner. I took up a position at the near post as Stan cut in from the bye-line. I was shouting at Stan to cut the ball back, but he flicked the ball in at the near post for a great goal. Stan later admitted to me that he heard my shout but he noticed Hibernian keeper Kerr move off his line in anticipation.\"\n\nLooking back at his playing career, one player stood out from the rest as far as Archie was concerned;\n\n\"George Hamilton was the best player to play for the club. George was the complete player and it was a privilege to play alongside him. It was all so different in those days, there wasn't a great deal of influence from the manager regarding tactics or coaching. Any success we had was usually down to us playing off the cuff as it were.\"\n\nAfter finishing his career in 1956 after three seasons with St Johnstone, Archie immediately began working for the Scottish Daily Express as a north east beat reporter. Despite offers to go full time as a journalist, Archie continued with his career as a PE teacher, a profession he had taken up during his time at Pittodrie.\n\n\"You have got to look at the whole picture and I count myself lucky to have survived the war. That was the big thing. To have been able to come back and play football again was a great thrill. To be honest I have never looked upon myself as being unlucky during the war and I don't have any regrets.\"\n\nArchie Baird - Aberdeen Record"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/archie.baird/2596340", "page_content": "Archie Baird\n\nassociation football player\n\nMarch 8, 1919 (age 90) Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire, United Kingdom\n\nHe was also capped once by the Scotland national football team Baird signed for Aberdeen before the Second World War, but the war started before he had made the first team He joined the British Army, but was captured and held as a prisoner of war.

Battles came to the club from the heart of Midlothian, but his connection with the Parkhead club ceased for a while after the famous strike after he and two other players refused to play on account of what they considered unfair comment in a Glasgow evening newspaper. Returning to the ranks of the Celtic he blossomed out as one of the finest full backs in the country and figured in several international contests and in a match v England at the Crystal Palace in 1901 he played the greatest match of his career. Although playing for Kilmarnock this season, Battles continued to take an interest in the Celts, and was a great favourite with that clubs supporters. During his brief illness he was attended by Dr. Scanlan and received the consolations of the church from the clergy. The funeral which took place to Dalbeth cemetery on Sunday was was witnessed by 40,000 spectators who lined the route along London road to the cemetery gate. Two thousand walked in the funeral procession which included representatives from Queens Park, Rangers ,Celtic, Kilmarnock, Partick Thistle, Third Lanark, Clyde and other clubs. The coffin was borne from the chapel gate by his former clubmates D.Doyle, John Campbell, Alex McMahon and W. Orr.

After grabbing the title in a final-day shootout with Aberdeen in May 1991 \u2013 less than four weeks after the dramatic departure of Graeme Souness to Liverpool \u2013 Smith had to rebuild quickly. With five players in and five out, it was the busiest summer of the club\u2019s nine successive titles in that era. Because of Uefa\u2019s imposed maximum of four foreign players, Smith had very little choice.\n\nThe most significant change was in goal, where he replaced the much-loved Chris Woods with Andy Goram. By October, it looked like a bad joke and one made on national television, no less. \u201cWhich Scottish football internationalist,\u201d asked A Question of Sport host David Coleman, \u201ctook two wickets in the NatWest Trophy?\u201d\n\n\u201cAndy Goram took the two wickets,\u201d Gordon Strachan replied. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t make any catches.\u201d Mocked by his international skipper on BBC 1, pressure on Goram meant pressure on Smith.\n\nAt the other end of the pitch, however, he had discovered alchemy. With Maurice Johnston\u2019s departure in November, Smith underlined his belief in the partnership of Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist and they repaid that faith with 115 goals between them in the next 17 months. With Goram finally finding his feet, Rangers drew in league leaders Hearts over the winter and powered towards a fourth championship on the spin, despite the odd moment of complacency such as an awful show at home to Celtic in March.\n\nThe Scottish Cup had been a problem, however, with no win in over a decade and some embarrassments under Souness. Rangers reached the semi-finals the hard way, winning at Pittodrie and Perth as well as coming from behind at home to holders Motherwell. Celtic, under Liam Brady, had hit form and their players had talked freely about how easy they had found the 2-0 win at Ibrox 10 days before. When Hateley injured his back against St Johnstone on the Saturday before the game, Rangers fans felt that the hoodoo was destined to continue when the two sides met at a rain-soaked Hampden Park on 31 March 1992.\n\nStuart McCall discovered the reality of life as a Rangers player when he took his family out for a Chinese meal after they had lost at home to Celtic on 21 March 1992 \u2013 10 days before the teams would meet again in the semi-final. \u201cEveryone was down after the match, but the table was there for 8.30pm so we still went out,\u201d he recalled in his autobiography. \u201cTo my amazement as we were strolling in this little Chinese guy came up to us and started shouting about how bloody useless Rangers were. He took our coats into the cloakroom, but came back with a Rangers scarf and proceeded to stamp on it in disgust, saying Rangers were bloody rubbish today!\n\n\u201cIt was the first time I had been to the restaurant and felt quite embarrassed for my family who thought it was extremely funny. The night went on and so did his verbal tirade and I finally snapped, promising him that in 10 days\u2019 time we would win and be celebrating. He was carried away too and said that we could bring all the players and their wives next time and get a free meal if we did win the semi. The strangest thing about the way he was ranting and raving was that it was meant, none of it was put on. We had to win that semi or else.\u201d\n\nGerry Creaney scores as Celtic beat Rangers 2-0 at Ibrox in the league in March 1992. Photograph: Jeff Holmes/Empics Sport\n\nCeltic were now 14 games undefeated, leading to large parts of the media proclaiming them as the \u201cbest footballing side\u201d in Scotland, even though they were trailing Rangers both on points and goals scored. All of a sudden style was the real measurement of success. The evening of Tuesday 31 March, however, was not a night for style. The weather was horrendous, with David Livingstone reporting trackside for Sky looking like one of those poor reporters that television news channels send out into the wildest of conditions so that those at home who don\u2019t understand isobars on a map can get the picture. Sky Sports, who did not yet have the English Premier League but did show a lot of Serie A, moved their broadcast of Milan v Juventus to 10pm in order to show this. As Glasgow was caught in a tempest, it was never going to be a night for the faint-hearted.\n\n\u201cJoe Miller and I were mates at Aberdeen,\u201d recalled David Robertson when I spoke to him about the match. \u201cWe were very close and I didn\u2019t want a friend to get the better of me in a game. Walter [Smith] and Archie [Knox] were winding me up before the game, saying: \u2018You need to sort him out early and do whatever you have to do to stop him.\u2019 The ball was thrown out to Joe and I was going full steam ahead. He took a little touch past me and I thought \u2018here\u2019s my chance\u2019 so I took him out. A little more than I planned to! In those days it was an unfortunate red card.\u201d\n\nBy the standards of the time, it was, especially so early in such an important game. Interestingly, those commentating in real time \u2013 Martin Tyler and Terry Butcher for Sky and Jock Brown for the BBC \u2013 felt that it was harsh while those with time and warmth on their side disagreed. Richard Keys, Ray Wilkins and Paul Elliott all made a case for the referee during the interval chat, as did Dougie Donnelly when he presented the highlights later that evening.\n\nNevertheless, with only six minutes gone, Rangers were down to 10 men and their curse in the Scottish Cup showed no signs of lifting. As furious as he looked on the touchline, Smith made the simple changes that gave his team some ballast against the onslaught as Nigel Spackman slotted in at centre-back while John Brown moved over to fill in at left-back. Celtic had much of the ball but opted for crosses too often against a tall and imposing defence. And then, right on the stroke of half-time, came the kind of goal that was becoming typical of these encounters.\n\nBrian O\u2019Neil was robbed in the middle of the park by the tenacity of the Rangers press, this time by McCall and McCoist. The two combined again to finish another devastating counterattack when McCoist found the only gap he could possibly see without even breaking stride. \u201cScenes of extravagant celebration,\u201d shouted Tyler on commentary. \u201cMcCoist is almost in tears of joy and disbelief.\u201d Only months after coming through the other side of his own emotional and professional tempest \u2013 coming close to an Ibrox exit after some often humiliating treatment by Souness and playing second fiddle to Hateley and Johnston \u2013 here he was in a quite literal one, doing what he did best.\n\nAlly McCoist gives Rangers the lead. Photograph: Jeff Holmes/Empics Sport\n\nWith a precious lead at the break, Archie Knox did all he could to ensure it stayed that way. \u201cI knew Celtic would throw everything at us in the second half,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. \u201cI went out before the second half kicked off and grabbed one of the ball boys at Hampden. I asked if he was a Rangers fan and he said \u2018yes\u2019. So I gave him a fiver and told him to get the message round his pals. If the ball went out for a Celtic throw-in, just leave it until the Celtic fans throw it back. If the ball goes out for a Rangers throw-in, just leave it full stop. I watched him go round all four sides of the Hampden pitch telling his pals not to go for the ball. We needed every advantage we could get and we managed to hang on for the win.\u201d\n\nKnox wasn\u2019t wrong and Rangers decided to sit in and defend what they had as Celtic, with the wind now behind them, sought to rescue their season in the remaining 45 minutes. They caused problems but rarely from direct range, with Miller failing to properly connect with the only chance he had in behind Brown. O\u2019Neil hit the post from distance with an effort that deflected off Spackman\u2019s hand. Mike Galloway, his replacement later in the half, stung Goram\u2019s palms from outside the area.\n\nGoram\u2019s goal frame was struck twice in quick succession, the first from a Paul McStay shot that left him rooted to the mud bath that constituted a six-yard area, and then he tipped a Gerry Creaney header from the resulting corner on to the same crossbar. Almost like a game of rugby, Rangers were conceding both possession and territory as Celtic began to create chances inside the box and the game\u2019s second flashpoint was a case in point.\n\nAlly McCoist and Nigel Spackman, and Andy Goram celebrate after Rangers win the semi-final.

Photographs: Jeff Holmes/Empics Sport.\n\nWith less than 10 minutes remaining, a tiring Rangers defence failed to clear a Celtic move and John Collins appeared to be fouled in the area by Brown. The replay showed that it was a fatigued and clumsy tackle, and Brown\u2019s left foot definitely made contact with the right foot of Collins. However, the Celtic midfielder was already on the way down when the contact took place, his body shape was that of the traditional simulation, and perhaps that created enough doubt in referee Andrew Waddell\u2019s mind.\n\nIf Collins had waited he would have been taken out and Celtic would surely have been presented with an opportunity to force a replay. As it happened, the Edinburgh official spent the final 10 minutes much in the same way he did the first, by ensuring that all of Glasgow had something to be incensed about. Galloway had another pot shot from 30 yards, but Goram got behind it and Rangers saw the remaining time out.\n\n\u201cIn the second half I was up in the stand,\u201d said Robertson. \u201cI was kicking every ball but it shows the fighting spirit that squad had. Even in later years, if you were 2-0 down to Falkirk, you still knew that you were going to come back and win.\u201d\n\nWinning in adversity was nothing new to Rangers. Only 15 months previously they had won an Old Firm cup final at the end of a horrid week, but this was something extra. At the end of a season of such transition and challenge, against a Celtic side in genuine form and in such match conditions, this demonstration of unity and spirit arguably surpassed anything that Souness was able to create.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when this Rangers squad had shown exactly what they are made of,\u201d wrote McCoist. \u201cWe reorganised superbly and played as well and as bravely as I can remember any Rangers team in my spell at Ibrox.\u201d The celebrations at the end said it all. The footage of Smith in his suit being held up by the man in whom he had placed so much trust, McCoist, punching and kicking the air with delight, tells a deeper story. Something was born that night that didn\u2019t just lead to success in the final two months later, it laid the foundations for the greatest season of all.\n\nRangers celebrate after beating Airdrie in the Scottish Cup final. Photograph: PA/Alamy\n\nRangers went on to win the league by nine points and beat Airdrie 2-1 in the Scottish Cup final. But by the summer of 1992, the Rangers Revolution was over. So far ahead of the rest, they were the undisputed kings of Scotland for as long as anyone could see. Bigger changes outside of Ibrox \u2013 one of them, the creation of the Champions League, driven by Rangers themselves \u2013 ensured this domination was contained at Berwick. No one was to know that at the time, however, and especially not one year later when Rangers were a goal in France away from their place in the inaugural Champions League final, their place taken instead by Marseille, weeks before their disgrace.\n\nThe 1992-93 season was arguably as good as it got for Rangers. A domestic treble, a 44-match unbeaten run in all competitions, the defeat of the English champions Leeds and another European golden boot for McCoist, the horizons seemed limitless before reality dawned and a more insular obsession \u2013 the pursuit of nine and 10 championships in a row \u2013 took hold.\n\nSmith\u2019s golden 1990s \u2013 the 13 trophies in six years, the treble, the two years of hobbling on with broken players and the tough structure that could unleash the genius of Paul Gascoigne and Brian Laudrup and in so doing, blunt the counter of Tommy Burns\u2019 Celtic \u2013 was born at Hampden that night in the rain. Souness\u2019s exciting, flash arrogance had been replaced with a band of brothers who would take Smith further than this predecessor was ever likely to go.\n\nThe eventual win in the final against Airdrie ensured that the season\u2019s hero completed the full set of Scottish medals. McCoist took a moment on that Hampden field and looked for the spot on the terracing where he had stood at the 1981 replay win over Dundee United. \u201cI remembered the hopes and dreams of the teenager who stood there.\u201d Even for an optimist like McCoist, dreams were now being surpassed by the magic of reality.\n\nThis is an edited extract from the book Revolution by Martyn Ramsay, published by JMD Media."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/62712695", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Scottish League Cup\n\nRobbie Ure made the dream start to his Rangers debut, with an early goal\n\nManager Giovanni van Bronckhorst watched Rangers secure a comfortable League Cup last-16 win over Queen of the South then said he fully expects Alfredo Morelos to remain at Ibrox beyond Thursday's transfer deadline.\n\nA debut goal from 18-year-old striker Robbie Ure gave Rangers the lead before Lee Connelly levelled for the visitors with a sublime curling shot.\n\nScott Arfield restored Rangers' advantage and the midfielder finished a slick passing move late in the game to ensure progress to the quarter-finals.\n\nMorelos' future has been in doubt with the striker, into the final year of his contract, dropped from the squad for last week's Champions League play-off win over PSV Eindhoven amid concerns over his fitness and attitude.\n\nVan Bronckhorst held talks with on Sunday with the the 26-year-old, who completed a two-match ban against Queens following his red card against Hibernian.\n\nThe Rangers boss aid: \"Yes, fully [expect him to stay].
