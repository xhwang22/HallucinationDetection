{"Jean Hugo also produced paintings, lithographs, sculptures, tapestries, and ceramics.": [{"url": "https://prabook.com/web/jean.hugo/3743152", "page_content": "Jean Hugo\n\nartist designer illustrator writer\n\nNovember 19, 1894 (age 89) Paris, France\n\nJean Hugo is mainly known as the author of a great number of sketches and oil or gouache paintings, which are often small sized. He also created illustrations for books, designed theatre sets, and costumes as well as produced ceramics, murals, textile designs and stained glass windows. Hugo's first published illustration appeared in 1918. It was a monogram for La Sir\u00e8ne publishing house. Then he also illustrated Les Joues en Feu by Raymond Radiguet, Bernouard, in 1920; Pommes d'Anis by Francis Jammes, Emile-Paul, 1923; Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel by Jean Cocteau, NRF, and Les Amis Nouvel by Paul Morand, Au Sans Pareil, both in 1924; Rom\u00e9o et Juliette by Shakespeare, Au Sans Pareil, in 1926, among others. Jean Hugo\u2019s paintings were unique in the artistic world of the 20th century. They maintained an authentic originality while recalling certain avant-garde themes of metaphysical painting or magical realism. At the start of the 1930s, in between various theatrical projects, including Jean Cocteau\u2019s Les mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel, he produced a series of masterful artworks, such as Solitude (1933). He was interested in forest scenes (L'Ermite de Meudon, 1933) and religious themes (La C\u00e8ne, 1933). L'Imposteur (1931) and La Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s (1932) were produced in the same period. Many of his paintings were based on the sketches that he created all the time. He used to say that \"inspiration comes naturally but one has to arrange regular meetings with it.\" L'Imposteur (1931) was a conclusion of Jean Hugo's first artistic period. Around this time he moved from Paris to the family property at the Mas de Fourques, Lunel, France, after the death of his grandmother. His painting of that period was a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired so far. The lessons of the Italian primitives, of Poussin, of Henri Rousseau, and Picasso, were among the sources of inspiration on which he was constantly drawing. In the middle of the 1930s, Jean Hugo started to use oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. The artist's work witnessed his intention to work outside of present-day currents and fashionable theories. He never took part in the artistic debates and paid the price for it by never achieving wide recognition of his work by the general public. The artist illustrated many limited edition books published between 1948 and 1984 by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Benoit (PAB), collaborating with such writers as Ren\u00e9 Char, Marcel Jouhandeau, Tristan Tzara and Ren\u00e9 Crevel. Jean Hugo's artworks were widely exhibited, with solo retrospectives taking place in France, England, Japan, Canada and the United States. Among the most prominent of them were: Jean Hugo and Max Jacob at the Claridge Gallery, London, 1929; Jean Hugo '77 at the Ueno Royal Museum, Tokyo, 1977; Paintings and Drawings by Jean Hugo and Jean Cocteau at Sotheby's, London, 1981; Jean Hugo: 1894-1984 at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts, B\u00e9ziers, 1985; Jean Hugo: a Retrospective at the Julian Barran Gallery, London, 1996; Jean Hugo et la Sc\u00e8ne at the Biblioth\u00e8que-mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra, Paris, 2001; Jean Hugo: l'Enlumineur du Quotidien at the Mus\u00e9e Pierre Andr\u00e9 Benoit, Al\u00e8s, 2014, etc."}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/461679", "page_content": "Resources for Research\n\nThe Met's Libraries and Research Centers provide unparalleled resources for research and welcome an international community of students and scholars.\n\nThe Met Collection API is where all makers, creators, researchers, and dreamers can connect to the most up-to-date data and public domain images for The Met collection.

He was self-taught, and studied literature before devoting himself to painting. He related his experiences in World War I in The Perspective of Memory ( Le Regard de la m\u00e9moire). After the war he associated himself with Cocteau, Radiguet, the composers known as Group of Six ( Groupe des Six), as well as Satie, Max Jacob, Picasso, Diaghilev and Stravinsky. He was married to Valentine Gross. From the 1920s he turned towards religion, and in 1929 he retreated to Mas de Fourques, near Lunel. He became particularly known for his stagings of Victor Hugo\u2019s dramas. He had a romantic temperament, and was most at home with gouache, quicker to dry than oil, and thus more apt for capturing fleeting inspiration, and a more substantial medium than watercolour. He was able to adapt medieval and romantic sources to a more contemporary treatment. It was by means of this somewhat Baroque side of his imagination that he often brushed with Surrealism, as is evidenced in his humorous, strange costume and set designs which he conceived in 1921 for Wedding on the Eiffel Tower ( Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel) by Jean Cocteau. The latter was a production of the Swedish Ballet, for which he developed a whole comical series of \u20181900\u2019 characters, such as cyclists and bathers. He also designed for the ballet-pantomime Romeo and Juliet, mounted in 1924, by the company, Paris Evenings ( Soir\u00e9es de Paris). Both productions were conceived by Jean Cocteau. Hugo then withdrew to the Midi region, where he painted still-lifes, and gouache landscapes in lively tones of the Languedoc, England, Paris and Russia. He was also an imaginative illustrator, some of his compositions including Cheeks on Fire ( Les Joues en feu) by Raymond Radiguet; Wedding on the Eiffel Tower ( Les Mari\u00e9s de la Tour Eiffel) by Jean Cocteau and Climates ( Climats) by Andr\u00e9 Maurois, one of his strangest illustrative works. He also illustrated many other works, such as those of Max Jacob, P\u00e9guy, Ren\u00e9 Char and Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Beno\u00eet.\n\nIn 1994, a collection of his works was shown at the Mus\u00e9e-biblioth\u00e8que Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Beno\u00eet in Al\u00e8s. In 1995, the Mus\u00e9e National de la Coop\u00e9ration Franco-Am\u00e9ricaine organised an exhibition at the Ch\u00e2teau de Bl\u00e9rancourt in Chauny of drawings executed at the front during World War I.

This imposing painting is a masterful assembly of the most important insights he had acquired thus far: the lessons of the Italian primitives, of Henri Rousseau, of Poussin and Picasso, sources of inspiration on which he is constantly drawing. The subject of the painting evokes the discomfort of the catechumen in the midst of the faithful, prevented from taking communion during Christmas mass at the Church of Saint-Francois in Montpellier. The painting is set in the countryside around Lunel, with its vineyards and low scrubland (garrigue). The tense and complex composition of the work is extremely well executed. No element, line, motif, nuance of colour or object is secondary. Each element contributes to the pictorial vision. The delicate volumes are bathed in an intense luminosity and stand out from the background. The figures are fixed in the space by superimposed connections, in the Florentine manner.\n\nIn the middle of the 1930s, he began using oil paints to create his larger compositions while continuing to paint with tempera. Le Mangeur au chandail ray\u00e9 (autoportrait) (1940) shows the artist in his home at the Mas de Fourques. The motif of the stripes contrasts with the neat contours of the table, the chimney and the wall. In this homely setting, the figure seems surrounded by mystery and casualness. Although Hugo does not draw greatly on De Chirico, this work evokes the feeling of isolation and mystery that characterises the production of the latter.\n\nJean Hugo\u2019s work bears witness to his intention to work outside of current trends and fashionable theories.

Nevertheless, EU countries may pass laws that allow a professional other than the seller to be the sole person responsible for paying the resale right or to share this responsibility with the seller.\n\nEU countries may also determine that the resale right does not apply: where the seller has acquired the work directly from the author less than 3 years before the resale; and where the resale price does not exceed \u20ac10,000.\n\n\n\nTerm of protection of the resale right\n\nThe term of protection is laid down by Directive 2006/116/EC which harmonises the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights and lasts for a period of 70 years after the death of the author.\n\nCalculation of the resale right\n\nEU countries are obliged to set a minimum sale price for sales subject to the resale right. This minimum sale price may not exceed \u20ac3,000.\n\nArtists receive royalties calculated as a percentage of the sale price of their works. The sale price is divided into five portions, and the rate of the royalty ranges from 4% to 0.25%, depending on the portion.\n\nHowever, the total amount of the royalty may not exceed \u20ac12,500.\n\nBeneficiaries\n\nThe resale right benefits the author of the work and, after his or her death, those entitled under him or her.\n\nAuthors who are nationals of non-EU countries may benefit from the resale right if the legislation in their country permits resale right protection in that country for authors from EU countries.\n\nHowever, EU countries may decide to apply this directive to authors who are nationals of non-EU countries but whose habitual residence is in the EU country concerned.\n\nRight to obtain information\n\nFor a period of 3 years after the resale, the persons entitled to receive royalties have the right to demand of any art market professional any information that may be necessary to secure payment of royalties from the resale.\n\nReport on implementation of the directive and key principles and recommendations\n\nIn 2011, the European Commission adopted a report on the directive\u2019s implementation. This proposed establishing a stakeholder dialogue (including rights collection management organisations, authors and art market professionals such as art dealers, galleries, auctioneers) tasked to recommend how to improve the system of resale right collection and distribution in the EU. In 2014, the representatives of these organisations signed up to \u2018Key Principles and Recommendations on the management of the Author Resale Right\u2019.\n\nFROM WHEN DOES THE DIRECTIVE APPLY?\n\nThis directive applies to all original works of art which, on 1 January 2006: were protected by EU countries\u2019 copyright laws; or met the criteria for protection under this directive.\n\nIt has applied since 13 October 2001 and had to become law in the EU countries by 1 January 2006.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAlthough the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works gives the author of an original work of art the resale right, this is not binding, which means that certain EU countries do not apply it. As a result of this, there are barriers to the internal market and distortions of competition within it, as well as a lack of protection for the authors of original artistic works.\n\nKEY TERMS\n\nResale right: the right, for the benefit of the author of an original work of art, to receive a percentage of the price obtained for any resale, made by professionals from the art market, of this work (auction houses, galleries or any other art market).\n\nMAIN DOCUMENT\n\nDirective 2001/84/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the resale right for the benefit of the author of an original work of art (OJ L 272, 13.10.2001, pp. 32-36)\n\nRELATED DOCUMENTS\n\nReport from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee: Report on the Implementation and Effect of the Resale Right Directive (2001/84/EC) (COM(2011) 878 final, 14.12.2011)\n\nDirective 2006/116/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the term of protection of copyright and certain related rights (codified version) (OJ L 372, 27.12.2006, pp. 12-18)\n\nSubsequent amendments to Directive 2006/116/EC have been incorporated in the basic text.
