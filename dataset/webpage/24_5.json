After Rudolf\u2019s death (1291), the electors, determined to prevent the German crown from becoming a hereditary possession of the Habsburgs, checked Albert\u2019s aspirations by choosing Adolf of Nassau as German king. Albert, however, drew the electors into an alliance and engineered the deposition (June 23, 1298) of Adolf, who was defeated in battle and slain on July 2, 1298, at G\u00f6llheim.\n\nMore From Britannica Germany: Albert I of Habsburg\n\nAlbert\u2019s election, proclaimed at Mainz before the battle, was repeated at Frankfurt on July 27; he was crowned at Aachen on August 24.\n\nAlbert formed an alliance in 1299 with Philip IV of France against Pope Boniface VIII, who had refused to recognize him as king. He tried to increase the power of his house by claiming (unsuccessfully) possession of Holland, Zealand, and Frisia as vacant fiefs. His pro-French policy and his effort to control the mouths of the Rhine were opposed by the four Rhenish electors, who tried to depose him. Albert, aided by the cities of the Rhineland, crushed the coalition in a series of campaigns between 1300 and 1302. He obtained confirmation of his election from Pope Boniface VIII on April 30, 1303, swore an oath of obedience to the pope, and promised that none of his sons should be elected German king without papal consent. His attempt to place his son Rudolf on the vacant throne of Bohemia in 1306 was only momentarily successful, and his claim to Thuringia and Meissen, inherited from Adolf of Nassau, was checked by a defeat near Lucka in 1307. Albert was assassinated by his nephew John of Swabia, later called the \u201cParricide,\u201d from whom the King had unjustly withheld his inheritance."}, {"url": "https://infogalactic.com/info/Albert_I,_Margrave_of_Meissen", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nAlbert I, the Proud (de: Albrecht I der Stolze) (1158 \u2013 24 June 1195), was the Margrave of Meissen from 1190 until his death in 1195. His father was Otto II, his mother Hedwig of Brandenburg. He was a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nHis father did not intend to let Albert succeed him, preferring his younger brother Dietrich. Albert did not accept this and started a war against his father and brother. In 1188, he even took his father prisoner. Under the orders of Frederick I, he had to set him free but he was able to obtain the title. Nevertheless, the conflict with his brother continued as he tried to regain the margraviate.[1][2]\n\nFile:Dresden F\u00fcrstenzug 081.JPG Otto II, Margrave of Meissen (1156\u20131190) and Albert, Margrave of Meissen (1190\u20131195); F\u00fcrstenzug, Dresden, Germany\n\nAfter Albert died in 1195 with no children to succeed him.

In 1221 he succeeded his father as Margrave of Meissen and Lusatia, at first under guardianship of his maternal uncle, Landgrave Louis IV of Thuringia, and after his death in 1227, under that of Duke Albert I of Saxony. In 1230 he was legally proclaimed an adult.\n\nHenry had his first combat experience in sometime around 1234, while on crusade in Prussia, fighting against the Pomesanians. His pilgrimage and company is well-documented by Peter of Dusburg, and it resulted in the construction of Balga castle, an important administrative centre for the Teutonic http://Knights.In 1245 after many years of conflict with the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg, he was forced to cede the fortresses of K\u00f6penick, Teltow and Mittenwalde north of Lower Lusatia. In 1249 however, the Silesian duke Boles\u0142aw II the Bald granted him the eastern area around Schiedlo Castle at the Oder river, where Henry founded the town of F\u00fcrstenberg.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the struggle between the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX, Henry took the side of the Emperor. In consideration, Frederick II in 1242 promised him the heritage of Henry Raspe as Landgrave of Thuringia and Count palatine of Saxony. In 1243 the Emperor also betrothed his daughter Margaret of Sicily to Henry's son Albert II.\n\n\n\n\n\nHenry remained a loyal supporter of the Hohenstaufens and not before the departure of Frederick's son Conrad IV from Germany did he recognise the antiking William of Holland. After the death of Henry Raspe in 1247, he enforced his rights in Thuringia by military means in the War of the Thuringian Succession against the claims raised by Sophie of Thuringia, daughter of late Landgrave Louis IV, and her husband Duke Henry II of Brabant, as well as by Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt-Zerbst. After a long drawn-out war he detached the Landgraviate of Hesse in the west and gave it to Sophie's younger son Henry, but kept Thuringia, which he granted to his son Albert II together with the Palatinate of Saxony. The Thuringian acquisition significantly increased the Wettin territorial possessions, which now reached from the Silesian border at the B\u00f3br river in the east up to the Werra in the west, and from the border with Bohemia along the Erzgebirge in the south to the Harz range in the north.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1273 Henry was an important support to the newly elected Rex Romanorum Rudolph of Habsburg in his struggle against rivaling King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Against Bohemia he won, among other places, Sayda and Purschenstein Castle near Neuhausen,\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was known throughout the whole empire as a glittering prince, famous as a patron of the arts and a model knight, and as a significant minnesinger (not to be confused with Heinrich Frauenlob), poet and composer. Henry was patron of many tournaments and singing competitions, in which he also took part himself, and commissioned the famous Christherre-Chronik. He set to music hymns to be sung in the churches, by express permission of the pope.\n\nFamily\n\nIn 1234 Henry married Constance of Babenberg, the daughter of Duke Leopold VI of Austria. Together they had two sons:\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbert II, Margrave of Meissen (1240\u20131314)\n\nTheodoric of Landsberg (1242\u20131285)\n\nAs early as 1265 he attached the Imperial Pleissnerland around Altenburg, the dowry of his daughter-in-law Margaret, to the Landgraviate of Thuringia and gave both to his elder son Albert II, otherwise Albert the Degenerate. For his younger son Theodoric, Henry had created \u2013 though without imperial consent \u2013 the smaller Margraviate of Landsberg in the western part of the Lusatian lands around Leipzig. Henry kept for himself only the Margraviate of Meissen, the remaining Lower Lusatian lands, and a formal power of oversight. Only domestic disorders, caused by the unworthiness of his son Albert, clouded the later years of his reign and indeed, long after his death in 1288, led to the loss of Lusatia and Thuringia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the death of Constance in 1243 Henry took as his second wife Agnes (d. 1268), a daughter of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, and in his third marriage the daughter of a ministerialis, or serving knight, Elisabeth von Maltitz, who bore him Friedrich Clem (whose only daughter Elisabeth married Otto II, Prince of Anhalt-Aschersleben) and Hermann the Long.\n\n\u4ea8\u5229\u4e09\u4e16\n\n\u8fc8\u68ee\u85e9\u4faf\n\n1221-1288\u5e74\n\n\u524d\u4efb \u897f\u5965\u591a\u91cc\u514b\u4e00\u4e16\n\n\u7ee7\u4efb\u8005

{"url": "http://dictionary.sensagent.com/battle%20of%20lucka/en-en/", "page_content": "The Battle of Lucka occurred on 31 May 1307 near the village of Lucka. The settlement was first mentioned in 1320, but had already existed for around 700 years before that. Lucka is located in the Altenburger Land district of Thuringia.\n\nThe battle was fought between the German king Albert I of the Habsburg dynasty and the Margrave Friedrich I of Meissen from the House of Wettin over the disputed ownership of the decedent estates left by Henry III the Illustrious, margrave of Meissen and Lusatia and Landgrave of Thuringia.\n\nWithin the disorder of the Great Interregnum after the end of the Hohenstaufen rule, Henry in 1261 had established the Margraviate of Landsberg in western Lusatia for his younger son Dietrich, however without any royal authorization. Dietrich of Landsberg himself left one son, Frederick Tuta, who also inherited the Lusatian march upon Henry's death in 1288, while his uncle Albert II the Degenerate at first retained Meissen and Thuringia. Shortly afterwards he sold Meissen to his nephew Frederick Tuta, who then had united most of the Wettin lands under his rule, but died without heirs in 1291.\n\nFrederick I of Meissen, eldest son of Albert II, and his younger brother Dietrich IV claimed Frederick Tuta's territories, which met with opposition not only from their father Albert II but also from King Adolf of Germany, who regarded them as reverted fiefs. In 1294 Albert II sold Thuringia to King Adolf, again facing fierce protest of his sons who felt deprived of their heritage. After a feud with their father they were able to take Wettin lands including Thuringia upon King Adolf's deposition in 1298.\n\nThe long-term dispute continued under Adolf's successor King Albert I of Habsburg, who tried to get the possession of the \"reverted\" Wettin lands and in 1307 started a campaign against Frederick I. Their troops met at Lucka, where the royal army fought under the command of Burgrave Frederick IV of Hohenzollern, but was finally defeated. This victory guaranteed the continuation of the House of Wettin. Today, the citizens of Lucka believe that their city received its town charter as a result of this victory.\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Albrecht-I-der-Stolze-Markgraf-von-Mei%C3%9Fen/6000000007462278739", "page_content": "About Albrecht I 'der Stolze' Markgraf von Mei\u00dfen\n\nhttp://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Albrecht_I._der_Stolze\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAlbrecht Markgraf von Mei\u00dfen (1)\n\nM, #113945, b. 1158, d. 25 June 1195\n\nLast Edited=22 Jun 2003\n\nAlbrecht Markgraf von Mei\u00dfen was born in 1158.

He was the younger son of Prince Friedrich Christian of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen and Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn und Taxis, and had four siblings:\n\nPrince Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen (1926) \u2013 married Princess Anastasia of Anhalt, no issue\n\nPrincess Maria Josepha (1928) \u2013 unmarried\n\nPrincess Anna (1929) \u2013 married Roberto de Afif, had issue\n\nPrincess Mathilde (1936) \u2013 married Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, had issue\n\nAfter finishing secondary school in Bregenz, Austria, the family moved to Munich where Albert studied history and ethnography at the Ludwig Maximilian University, receiving his Ph.D. in 1961. He worked as a historian, particularly studying the history of the Duchy and then the Kingdom of Saxony and their relationship to Bavaria.\n\nIn a civil ceremony on April 10, 1980 and a religious ceremony two days later at the Theatinerkirche in Munich, Albert married Elmira Henke. She had been his assistant for many years. They had no children.\n\nUpon the death of his elder brother, Maria Emanuel, in July 2012, Albert assumed the Headship of the House of Saxony. This was disputed as Maria Emanuel had named, and adopted, his nephew, Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe as his rightful heir. (More on the succession dispute below). However, Albert\u2019s role in the dispute was short-lived, as he passed away in Munich just three months later, on October 6, 2012. He is buried in the Old Catholic Cemetery in Dresden along with his wife.\n\nSUCCESSION DISPUTE\n\nHaving no children, in May 1977 Maria Emanuel named his nephew, Prince Alexander of Saxe-Gessaphe, as his heir. Alexander was the son of the Margrave\u2019s eldest sister Anna. A document was drafted and agreed to, and signed by, all the other members of the former royal house. And two years later, in September 1999, Maria Emanuel legally adopted Alexander. However, in 2002, three of the family members retracted their agreement. One of them was Maria Emanuel\u2019s younger brother, Albert, who stated that the headship of the family should eventually pass to Prince R\u00fcdiger \u2013 the son of their late cousin, Prince Timo of Saxony. Despite this disagreement, Maria Emanuel continued to assert that Prince Alexander was his rightful heir. Following his death in July 2012, both Albert and Alexander claimed the headship of the family. When Albert died just three months later, the dispute intensified. Prince R\u00fcdiger claimed that he was the rightful heir, and assumed the title Margrave of Meissen, just as Prince Alexander had done upon Maria Emanuel\u2019s death.\n\nIn 2015, the heads of three Ernestine branches of the House of Wettin \u2013 Michael, Prince of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Andreas, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and Konrad, Prince of Saxe-Meiningen \u2013 issued a statement stating that they did not recognize Prince Alexander as Head of the House of Saxony, nor as Margrave of Meissen. It is notable that their statement did not specifically recognize Prince R\u00fcdiger either.\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nSaxony Resources at Unofficial Royalty\n\n* * * * * * * * * *\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The fourth child and youngest son of Friedrich Christian, Margrave of Meissen and his wife Princess Elisabeth Helene of Thurn and Taxis, he was the younger brother of Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, who was his predecessor as head of the Royal House of Saxony.\n\nLife\n\nAlbert received his secondary education at the Federal Gymnasium in Bregenz, Austria. He passed his matura in 1954. His parents and their children then moved to Munich, with support from his mother's relatives from the Thurn und Taxis dynasty. In Munich, Albert studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University. He initially studied macroeconomics, and later switched to history and ethnography. On 13 February 1961, he received his PhD for a thesis on his great-great-grandfather, King John of Saxony, and his reform of Saxon commercial law.\n\nOn 30 January 1960 the Studiengruppe f\u00fcr S\u00e4chsische Geschichte und Kultur e.V. (\"Study group for Saxon history and culture\") was founded by Albert together with his parents, his elder brother Maria Emanuel, some other Saxon nobles, the Chapter of the Military Order of St. Henry, the chapter of the association of people from Dresden, and the association of Heimatvertriebene in the history department of the University of Munich. This study group became one of the largest historical societies in West Germany. After completing his studies, Albert worked as a historian and referent. He studied the history of the Duchy of Saxony and the Kingdom of Saxony, in particular the relationship of Saxony to Bavaria.\n\nAt times, he was vice president of the Bund der Mitteldeutschen (\"Association of Central Germans\"). In 1972, he joined the Mitteldeutschen Kulturrat e.V. (\"Central German Culture Council\"), where he represented the interests of the Free State of Saxony.\n\nIn the summer of 1982, he was allowed to visit Saxony for the first time since his youth. He visited again in 1983 and 1985. He was then not allowed to enter the German Democratic Republic again, for unknown reasons, until 1989/1990. On 22 January 1990, he participated in a Monday demonstration in Dresden and was unexpectedly asked to address the crowd. He told his audience about their task to rebuild Saxony and ended with the words \"Long live Saxony, Germany, Europe and the western-Christian culture.\"\n\nIn the subsequent elections for the Saxon parliament, he ran as a DSU candidate; he was not elected, nor did the newly elected government of Saxony employ him as an advisor. After the German reunification, he has tried to reclaim some of his family's former possessions.\n\nMarriage\n\nThe Margrave and Margravine of Meissen The Margrave and Margravine of Meissen\n\nAlbert morganatically wed Elmira Henke in a civil ceremony on 10 April 1980 in Munich, and in a religious ceremony on 12 April 1980, in the Theatine Church, also in Munich. Elmira assisted Albert with his scientific and historical studies; she specialized in ethnographic topics. Albert and Elmira had no children.\n\nSuccession\n\nThe headship of the Royal House of Saxony is a matter of dispute in the Saxon Royal Family. The conflict stems from the fact that the last undisputed head of the house Maria Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen, and the other princes of his generation either had no children or, in the case of Prince Timo, had children (including Prince R\u00fcdiger of Saxony) who were deemed not to be members of the Royal House of Saxony.\n\nThe first designated dynastic heir of Maria Emanuel was his and Albert's nephew Prince Johannes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, only son of their youngest sister Princess Mathilde of Saxony by her marriage to Prince Johannes Heinrich of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, dynast of a ducal branch of the House of Wettin senior patrilineally to the royal branch. After the early death of Prince Johannes, the heirless Maria Emanuel then considered as potential heir another nephew, Alexander Afif, the eldest son of Princess Anna of Saxony and her husband Roberto Afif, despite the Afif-Saxony marriage being contrary to the traditional laws of the House of Saxony which required equal marriages for descendants to inherit dynastic rights. On 14 May 1997 the Margrave of Meissen proposed his nephew Alexander Afif as heir and drew up a document that was signed by the other male and female members of the Royal House (including previously non-dynastic spouses of princes) setting out that Alexander would succeed on his death. The document was signed by: Anastasia, Margravine of Meissen, Prince Albert and his wife, n\u00e9e Elmira Henke, Prince Dedo (for himself, his brother Prince Gero and for their stepmother n\u00e9e Virginia Dulon - his brother Prince Timo had died in 1982), the Princesses Maria Josepha, Anna and Mathilde, and Prince Timo's third wife, n\u00e9e Erina Eilts). Two years later on 1 July 1999 the Margrave adopted his nephew Alexander Afif, who had used the title Alexander, Prince of Saxe-Gessaphe since 1972, based on his patrlineal descent from the once-sovereign Lebanese \"Afif\" (or Gessaphe) dynasty.\n\nThe 1997 agreement proved to be controversial and in the summer of 2002 three of the signatories, Princes Albert, Dedo and Gero (the latter consented via proxy but had not personally signed the document) retracted their support for the agreement. The following year Prince Albert wrote that it is through Prince R\u00fcdiger and his sons that the direct line of the Albertine branch of the House of Wettin will continue, and thus avoid becoming extinct. Until his death, however, the Margrave, as head of the former dynasty, continued to regard his nephew and adopted son, Prince Alexander, as the contractual heir entitled to succeed.\n\nImmediately following the death of Maria Emanuel in July 2012, Prince Albert assumed the position of head of the Royal House of Saxony. According to the Eurohistory Journal prior to the Margrave's funeral Albert met with his nephew, Alexander and recognised him as Margrave of Meissen. However this claim is contradicted by Albert himself in his final interview, given after the funeral, where he states that he needs recognition as Margrave of Meissen. Prince Alexander, citing the 1997 agreement has also assumed the headship. Albert, Margrave of Meissen died at a hospital in Munich on 6 October 2012 at the age of 77.\n\nPrior to the requiem for Margrave Maria Emanuel, R\u00fcdiger, who had sought to be recognised by his uncle as a dynastic member of the House of Saxony but was refused, conducted a demonstration outside the cathedral with Saxon royalists in protest against the late Margrave Maria Emanuel's decision to appoint Alexander as heir.\n\nThe family website of Prince R\u00fcdiger states prior to his death Albert determined R\u00fcdiger to be his successor and instituted a clear succession plan. On this basis following Albert's death Prince R\u00fcdiger assumed the headship of the house.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n30 November 1934 \u2013 23 July 2012: His Royal Highness Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Saxony\n\nPrince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Saxony 23 July 2012 \u2013 6 October 2012: His Royal Highness The Margrave of Meissen\n\nIn Germany\n\n30 November 1934 - 23 July 2012: Albert Prinz von Sachsen Herzog zu Sachsen\n\n23 July - 6 October 2012: Albert Markgraf von Mei\u00dfen\n\nAncestry\n\nAncestors of Albert, Margrave of Meissen (1934\u20132012) 16.
