He was the second son of eastern wei's paramount general Gao Huan, and the death of his brother and Gao Huan's designated successor Gao Cheng in 549 became the regent of eastern wei. In 550, he forced Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi.\n\nEarly in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for attentiveness to military matters, and the strength of the northern qi military was at its prime. He also tried to equalize the tax burden and reduce corruption by offering officials sufficient salary. He entrusted most governmental matters to the capable Yang Yin, and for a while, the government was effective, and the military was strong. However, Emperor Wenxuan eventually turned cruel, and his erratic behavior, fueled by alcoholism, plunged his administration into chaos.\n\n\n\nEarly life Gao Yang was born in 529, while his father Gao Huan was a Han chinese general under northern wei's paramount general Erzhu Rong. His mother Lou Zhaojun was Gao Huan's wife, on whose financial support Gao's early career had relied on. Lou Zhaojun was an ethnic Xianbei. He was their second son, after his older brother Gao Cheng. After Erzhu Rong's death in 530, Gao Huan overthrew Erzhu's family and became northern wei's paramount general, and after northern wei divided into eastern wei and western wei in 534 became the actual power controlling eastern wei. Gao Yang thus grew up in a household of power. In 535, he was created the Duke of Taiyuan.\n\nGao Yang was not well regarded as a child, as he was awkward in interpersonal skills and at times considered developmentally disabled, being unable to carry out many tasks common for children. However, it appeared that he was actually of fairly high capability in many areas, and once, when Gao Huan tried to test his children's intelligence by giving them tangled balls of yarn to untangle, Gao Yang took out his sword and sliced the ball open, stating that that was the only solution. As Gao Huan's sons grew older, on one occasion, Gao Huan wanted to test their military abilities by having his general Peng Le (\u5f6d\u6a02) launch a mock attack on them. All of Gao Huan's sons, including the older Gao Cheng, were fearful, but Gao Yang reacted calmly and actually captured Peng. As he grew, he continued to be awkward and appearing to be unintelligent, and Gao Cheng, in particular, often looked down on him.\n\nGao Huan died in 547, and thereafter, Gao Cheng, who had already controlled many aspects of eastern wei imperial government's operations, took over as regent. He moved to consolidate his power further, and when Emperor Xiaojing of eastern wei tried to form a plot to kill him, he discovered the plot and put Emperor Xiaojing under effective house arrest. He then planned taking the throne himself, but at a meeting in 549 at the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), with his officials Chen Yuankang (\u9673\u5143\u5eb7), Cui Jishu (\u5d14\u5b63\u8212), and Yang Yin, to discuss the procedure for doing so, he was assassinated by his servant Lan Jing (\u862d\u4eac), who was angry at his wrongful treatment. At that time, Gao Yang happened to be in Yecheng, and he quickly gathered the guards and killed Lan and his co-conspirators. He chose not to announce Gao Cheng's death immediately, while moving to consolidate power.\n\n\n\nAs Eastern Wei regent Initially, Emperor Xiaojing, who had received rumors that Gao Cheng had died, thought he might have a chance to regain power. However, upon meeting Gao Yang, who made a display of force by having more than 200 guards accompany him, Emperor Xiaojing saw that Gao Yang could not be easily dealt with. Meanwhile, Gao Yang headed for the Gaos' stronghold of Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi ), and consolidated his military command there, quickly impressing the generals who had previously looked down on him with quick and careful decisions.\n\nIn fall and winter 549, with rival liang dynasty under internal turmoil after the rebellion of Hou Jing (a former eastern wei general who had defected to Liang in 547), Gao Yang sent Peng Le to attack the Liang border provinces, taking over the region between the Huai River and Yangtze River with ease.\n\nIn spring 550, Gao Yang had Emperor Xiaojing convey on him the greater title of Prince of Qi Commandery. Two months later, his title was made the even greater title of Prince of Qi.\n\nIn summer 550, under advice from the officials Gao Dezheng (\u9ad8\u5fb7\u653f), Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), and Song Jingye (\u5b8b\u666f\u696d), Gao Yang decided to take the throne, despite reservations from Gao Yang's mother Princess Dowager Lou. He therefore headed from Jinyang to Yecheng, but even as he was on the way and had reached the halfway city of Pingdu (\u5e73\u90fd, in modern Jinzhong, Shanxi ), the officials largely pretended to ignore his overtures at taking the throne, so he returned to Jinyang. Soon thereafter, he had Emperor Xiaojing issue an edict conferring the nine bestowments on him, further displaying his posture of taking the throne. He then proceeded to Yecheng again, and Emperor Xiaojing yielded the throne to him, ending eastern wei and establishing northern qi, with Gao Yang as its Emperor Wenxuan. He created the former Emperor Xiaojing the Prince of Zhongshan. He posthumously honored Gao Huan and Gao Cheng as emperors, while honoring his mother as empress dowager.\n\n\n\nEarly reign Early in Emperor Wenxuan's reign, he was known for being attentive to important matters of state, particularly military matters. He revised eastern wei laws, and he selected elite soldiers from both Xianbei and Han ethnicities to form the border defense corps. To equalize the tax and labor burden, he divided the households under his rule into nine classes based on their wealth, requiring the wealthy to pay more taxes and the poor to contribute more labor. Continuing a trend set by both his father Gao Huan and his brother Gao Cheng, he divided his time between Yecheng and Jinyang, effectively making Jinyang a second capital.\n\nWhile Emperor Wenxuan was ethnically Han, like his father Gao Huan, he viewed himself as Xianbei rather than Han. Further, more than his father did, he looked down on Han traditions, not willing to follow them. Because of this, Gao Dezheng and another official, Gao Longzhi (\u9ad8\u9686\u4e4b), who wanted to ingratiate themselves with Emperor Wenxuan's cousin and powerful general Duan Shao (\u6bb5\u97f6), suggested he make Duan Shao's sister Lady Duan, a concubine of his, empress. Emperor Wenxuan did not follow their advice and, pursuant to expected norm, created his wife Princess Li Zu'e empress and created her son Gao Yin crown prince.\n\nIn response to the establishment of northern qi, Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of rival western wei, launched a major attack on northern qi. Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops to defend against Yuwen's attack. When Yuwen saw that Emperor Wenxuan's troops were well-organized, he sighed and stated, \"Gao Huan is not yet dead. \" He was unable to overcome Emperor Wenxuan's defense and so was forced to withdraw, and in fact lost some border commanderies to northern qi in the campaign.\n\nAround the new year 552, Emperor Wenxuan wanted to put the former emperor, the Prince of Zhongshan, to death. He first invited his sister and the prince's wife, the Princess Taiyuan, to a feast. As soon as she left the prince's household, he sent assassins to force the prince to drink poison, and also killed his three sons. He buried the former emperor with imperial honors, but at a later point, for reasons unknown, he dug out the former emperor's casket and threw it into the Zhang River (\u6f33\u6c34, flowing near Yecheng).\n\nIn spring 552, Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops against the Kumo Xi tribe (in the upper Liao River drainage area) and achieved a great victory. Around the same time, he also sent generals to seize certain border cities with Liang, as Liang troops continued to battle Hou Jing, who declared himself the Emperor of Han in 551 but was subsequently defeated by Emperor Yuan of Liang in 552. The campaigns of seizing Liang cities continued even after Hou's defeat, although he did not at this point launch a single major attack on Liang. The campaigns appeared to end in winter 552, and Emperor Wenxuan in fact promised the Liang generals Wang Sengbian and Chen Baxian, whom Emperor Yuan put in charge of the eastern half of Liang territory, to return the cities of Guangling (\u5ee3\u9675, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu ) and Liyang (\u6b77\u967d, in modern Chaohu, Anhui ).\n\nAlso in winter 552, Emperor Wenxuan personally led troops from Jinyang to Lishi (\u96e2\u77f3, in modern L\u00fcliang, Shanxi ), and he ordered the construction of a Great Wall from Huanglu Mountain (\u9ec3\u6ae8\u5dba, also in modern L\u00fcliang) to Sheping Fortress (\u793e\u5e73\u620d, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi ), apparently to defend against western wei and Tujue.\n\nIn winter 553, Khitan tribes were attacking northern qi's northern borders, and Emperor Wenxuan himself led troops to attack Khitan\u2014and on this campaign, he was described as personally exposing himself to the dangers and contributing much personally to defeating the Khitan.\n\nAlso in winter 553, Emperor Wenxuan, wanting to put northern qi-friendly emperor on the Liang throne, commissioned an army commanded by Guo yuanjian (\u90ed\u5143\u5efa) to escort Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Tui (\u856d\u9000), who had surrendered to eastern wei in 548, back to Liang territory. However, northern qi forces were defeated by the Liang general Hou Tian (\u4faf\u7471), and Xiao Tui returned to Yecheng.\n\nAround the new year 554, the remnants of Rouran, which by that point was near its end, surrendered to northern qi to seek protection from Tujue attacks. Emperor Wenxuan personally attacked the Tujue, fighting its army off, and then created Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen as the new khan of Rouran, settling the Rouran people within northern qi territory, at Mayi (\u99ac\u9091, in modern Shuozhou, Shanxi ).\n\nIn spring 554, Emperor Wenxuan, assisted by the senior general Hul\u00fc Jin (\u659b\u5f8b\u91d1) and his brother Gao Yan the Prince of Changshan, launched a major attack on the Shanhu (\u5c71\u80e1) tribe (in modern L\u00fcliang). After victory, he ordered that all 11-year-old and older males of the Shanhu be slaughtered, and that the females and the young males be awarded as spoils of war to the soldiers. When one of his commanders died because that commander's lieutenant, Lu Huili (\u8def\u6689\u79ae), was unable to save him, Emperor Wenxuan ordered that Lu's internal organs be cut out of his body and that the soldiers consume them. Many traditional historians, including Li Yanshou (\u674e\u5ef6\u58fd), the author of the History of Northern Dynasties, and Sima Guang, the author of the Zizhi Tongjian, saw this battle as the turning point of Emperor Wenxuan's rule\u2014that thereafter, he began to act violently and capriciously. For example, in spring 554, when Rouran rebelled and he personally led troops to defeat Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, he felt that warhorses offered by the general Heba Ren (\u8cc0\u62d4\u4ec1) the Prince of Anding were not of sufficient quality\u2014and he punished Heba by plucking out Heba's hair and demoting to commoner status, and further ordering Heba to serve as a worker in a coal processing facility. In another example, in fall 554, after he had put the official Yuan Xu (\u5143\u65ed), a former northern wei prince, to death, he remembered the snubs that Gao Longzhi, who was a friend of Yuan Xu's, had shown him before he became eastern wei's regent, and he had Gao Longzhi battered so severely that Gao Longzhi died several days later\u2014and at a later point, still angry at Gao Longzhi, arrested Gao Longzhi's 20 sons and, with 20 executioners lined up, had the sons beheaded simultaneously, and then threw their bodies and Gao Longzhi's body thrown into the Zhang River.\n\nStarting in 551, Emperor Wenxuan had ordered his official Wei Shou to compile a history of northern wei. Wei Shou completed the work in 554, but his work (Book of Wei) was criticized by many to be defamatory to ancestors of many political enemies (so much so that they referred to the work as Huishu (\u7a62\u66f8\u2014the Book of Filth)), and several officials filed reports condemning Wei Shou. Wei Shou submitted a petition to Emperor Wenxuan defending himself, and Emperor Wenxuan, in an act that he believed to be protecting the integrity of history, jailed the officials who condemned Wei Shou.\n\nIn late 554, western wei launched a major attack on Jiangling (\u6c5f\u9675, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei ), then the capital of Liang. Emperor Wenxuan commissioned an army commanded by Gao Huan's cousin Gao Yue (\u9ad8\u5cb3) the Prince of Qinghe to attack western wei's An Province (\u5b89\u5dde, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei ) to try to relieve pressure from Jiangling, but by the time that Gao Yue arrived, Jiangling had already fallen, and western wei captured and then executed Emperor Yuan.\n\n\n\nLate reign western wei declared Emperor Yuan's nephew Xiao Cha the Emperor of Liang, but the declaration was not recognized by most Liang generals, and the chief of those generals, Wang Sengbian, welcomed Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an to the old Liang capital Jiankang, declaring him the Prince of Liang in spring 555 and preparing to make him emperor. Emperor Wenxuan had other ideas, however, and he created Emperor Yuan's cousin Xiao Yuanming the Marquess of Zhenyang, whom eastern wei captured in 547 during Liang's attempt to aid Hou Jing's rebellion against eastern wei, emperor, commissioning his brother Gao Hu\u00e0n (\u9ad8\u6e19, note tone difference with his father) the Prince of Shangdang to command an army to escort Xiao Yuanming back to Liang territory. Emperor Wenxuan wrote letters to Wang recommending Xiao Yuanming as emperor, arguing that Xiao Fangzhi (who was 12 years old) was too young. Wang initially rejected Xiao Yuanming, but after Gao Huan won a few battles over Wang's generals, Wang decided to submit and, after northern qi escorting troops agreed to limit their presence to 1,000 men, and Xiao Yuanming agreed to make Xiao Fangzhi crown prince, accepted Xiao Yuanming as emperor. To show his good faith, Wang sent his son Wang Xian (\u738b\u986f) and nephew Wang Shizhen (\u738b\u4e16\u73cd), as well as Wang Xian's mother Lady Liu, to Yecheng as hostages. Xiao Yuanming became Liang's emperor, and there was peace between northern qi and Liang, with Liang now a vassal.\n\nJust four months later, however, the situation changed. Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian, displeased over Xiao Yuanming's ascension (as he saw Xiao Yuanming's claim as being too attenuated), make a surprise attack on Jiankang from his headquarters of Jingkou (\u4eac\u53e3, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu ), killing Wang Sengbian and forcing Xiao Yuanming to yield the throne to Xiao Fangzhi (who took the throne as Emperor Jing). Initially, Chen claimed that Liang would still agree to be a vassal, and Emperor Wenxuan sent the official Sima Gong (\u53f8\u99ac\u606d) to swear an oath with Liang officials. However, with several generals loyal to Wang Sengbian rising against Chen following Wang's death, Emperor Wenxuan's mind changed, particularly after two, Xu Sihui (\u5f90\u55e3\u5fbd) and Ren Yue (\u4efb\u7d04) submitted to him, making a surprise attack on the near-Jiankang fortress Shitou and capturing it. Emperor Wenxuan sent the general Xiao Gui (\u856d\u8ecc) to reinforce Xu and Ren. Chen defeated northern qi troops and Xu and Ren, however, and Xiao Gui's assistant Liu Damo (\u67f3\u9054\u6469), sieged by Chen in Shitou, sought peace. Chen agreed, and sent his nephew Chen Tanlang (\u9673\u66c7\u6717), Emperor Jing's nephew Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia, and Wang Min (\u738b\u73c9), the son of the key official Wang Chong (\u738b\u6c96), to serve as hostages to northern qi, allowing Liu to withdraw. (Upon Liu's return to northern qi, however, Emperor Wenxuan had him executed. )\n\nDuring the campaign against Liang, Emperor Wenxuan made another display of his increasing instability, as he, jealous over the fact that his concubine Consort Xue had previously had a sexual relationship with Gao Yue, ordered Gao Yue to commit suicide. Thereafter, he beheaded Consort Xue and hid her head in his sleeves. At a banquet later that day, he tossed her head onto a platter and cut her body into pieces, beginning to play with her leg, surprising all of the banquet attendants. At the end of the banquet, he packed her body parts and began crying, following the cart carrying her body on foot.\n\nIn fall 555, Emperor Wenxuan became convinced that Buddhism and Taoism should be but one religion, and that one of them should be merged into the other. He had the leading Buddhist and Taoist monks debate before him, and he declared the Buddhists the victors, ordering Taoism merged into Buddhism and Taoist monks to become Buddhist monks. Some Taoist monks initially rejected this edict, but after he executed four monks, the others submitted, and Taoism became banned within northern qi.\n\nIn spring 556, border battles between northern qi and Liang resumed, and northern qi prepared another campaign against Liang. In summer 556, northern qi forces were again south of the Yangtze, operating in Jiankang's vicinity, but they were stalemated against Liang troops, eventually defeated by Chen and his generals after they ran out of food. A number of northern wei generals were captured and executed by Liang, and in response, Emperor Wenxuan put Chen Tanlang to death.\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's erratic behavior became even greater in scope, fueled by his alcoholism. As described by Sima Guang in his Zizhi Tongjian: . . . [Emperor Wenxuan] drank heavily and lived immorality, carrying out cruel and barbarous act at his on whim. Sometimes he sang and danced day and night. Sometimes he spread his hair and wore barbarian clothing with colorful sashes. Sometimes he bared his body and put on makeup. Sometimes he rode donkeys, cows, camels, or elephants without using saddles. Sometimes he ordered Cui Jishu or Liu Taozhi (\u5289\u6843\u679d) to carry him and a large drum to allow him to beat the drums. He was accustomed to making surprise charges into the nobles' and imperial officials' private residences. He often crossed streets, sometimes sitting in the streets and sometimes even sleeping on them. Sometimes when it is warm, he would be naked to bask in the sun, but even in the coldest winter, he would strip naked as well and run around. His attendants could not stand his behavior, but he himself did not care. . . . Once, he asked a woman on the street, \"How is the Son of Heaven like?\" The woman responded, \"He is so crazy that he really cannot be considered a Son of Heaven. \" He beheaded her.\n\nOnce, when he was drunk and acting irrationally, Empress Dowager Lou rebuked him, and he threatened to marry her to an old barbarian. When she became angry, he became fearful, and he wanted to induce her to smile again, so he crawled on the ground under her seat, but in doing so, he flipped the seat over, and she was injured. After he sobered up, he realized how he had been injured, and he set a large fire, intending to jump in to die, causing her to have to grab him to save him. He thereafter pledged not to drink any more, but was only able to do so for 10 days before he began drinking again. He also once shot an arrow at Empress Li's mother Lady Cui and whipped her. Further, it was described that most women of the imperial Gao clan were forced to have sexual relations with him at one point or another. When Gao Huan's concubine Erzhu Ying'e, the Princess Dowager of Pengcheng, refused, he killed her with his own hands. Emperor Wenxuan also became homicidal when he drank, and he always wanted to kill people when he was drunk. Yang Yin, who was prime minister at this point, therefore set up a group of condemned prisoners to be available to the palace guards\u2014if Emperor Wenxuan wanted to kill someone, a condemned prisoner would be brought out for him to kill, and if a prisoner was able to survive for three months without being killed, he would be set free.\n\nHowever, even in his erratic behavior, Emperor Wenxuan was still attentive to many important matters, and because of his harshness, his officials did not dare to be corrupt. Further, Yang was a capable prime minister, and Emperor Wenxuan gave him full authorization to carry out laws properly. Therefore, it was said at the time that while the emperor was violent and insane, the government was nevertheless efficient.\n\nIn winter 557, believing prophecies that Gao Hu\u00e0n would be emperor, he ordered Gao Hu\u00e0n arrested. Gao Hu\u00e0n tried to resist, but was nevertheless captured and delivered to Yecheng. When another brother, Gao Jun (\u9ad8\u6d5a) the prince of Yong'an, sent petitions urging him to change his behavior, he had Gao Jun arrested as well, and the two princes were imprisoned in a dungeon.\n\nAlso in winter 557, Chen Baxian had Liang's Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing chen dynasty, and subsequently had Emperor Jing killed in 558. The general Wang Lin, then in control of modern Hunan and eastern Hubei , refused to submit to Chen and sought to continue Liang's lineage. He therefore requested northern qi to return Xiao Zhuang the Prince of Yongjia to be emperor. In spring 558, northern qi troops escorted Xiao Zhuang to Wang's territory, and Wang declared Xiao Zhuang emperor, as a northern qi vassal, with his capital at Jiangxia (\u6c5f\u590f, in modern Wuhan, Hubei ).\n\nBy this point, Emperor Wenxuan's military campaigns and other wasteful behavior had caused the imperial treasury to be drained. He had also become unhappy with his son Gao Yin, believing that Gao Yin was too Han-like in behavior, and he considered deposing Gao Yin. Once, he ordered Gao Yin to personally execute a prisoner, but Gao Yin could not bring himself to do so, and Emperor Wenxuan battered him with a whip handle, causing Gao Yin to thereafter have a panic disorder and at times unable to speak. When Emperor Wenxuan became drunk, he would often state that he might eventually pass the throne to his brother Gao Yan, and he stopped stating as such only after urging by Yang and Wei Shou, who believed that his words were causing an unstabling effect in causing a doubt as to who would succeed him.\n\nAround the new year 559, Emperor Wenxuan visited the imprisoned Gao Jun and Gao Hu\u00e0n. He initially took pity on them and considered releasing them, but, at the urging of another brother, Gao Dan the Prince of Changguang, did not do so, and further started to pierce them with spears. He also ordered that torches be thrown at them, burning them to death. He rewarded the princes' wives to the soldiers who delivered the death blows.\n\nIn summer 559, Emperor Wenxuan, suspecting that the members of the northern wei imperial Yuan clan would eventually try to return to power, ordered the Yuans to be slaughtered, regardless of age or gender, and had the bodies thrown into the Zhang River. Only several households who were particularly close to the Gaos were spared.\n\nIn fall 559, Emperor Wenxuan suffered a major illness that historians believed to be alcoholism-driven. He stated to Empress Li, \"A person will live and die, and there is nothing to regret, other than that our son Gao Yin is still young, and someone else will take his throne. \" He stated to Gao Yan, \"Go ahead and take the throne, but do not kill him!\" However, he did not change the succession order, and after his death, Gao Yin took the throne as Emperor Fei. The officials tried to mourn at his death, but no one was actually able to shed a tear other than Yang Yin.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Emperor_Wenxuan_of_Northern_Qi/", "page_content": "Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi\n\nEmperor Wenxuan of (Northern) Qi ((\u5317)\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d) (526\u2013559), personal name Gao Yang (\u9ad8\u6d0b, Wade\u2013Giles: Kao Yang), courtesy name Zijin (\u5b50\u9032), Xianbei name Hounigan (\u4faf\u5c3c\u5e72), was the founding emperor of the Northern Qi dynasty of China.

It belongs to the so-called Northern Dynasties \u5317\u671d (386~581) and was founded by Gao Yang \u9ad8\u6d0b, son of the powerful general Gao Huan \u9ad8\u6b61, who dominated the court of the Eastern Wei dynasty \u6771\u9b4f (534-550). The Northern Qi empire covered the lower region of the Yellow River, modern Shanxi, the Shandong Peninsula, and the northern parts of modern Jiangsu and Anhui. The continuing military campaigns of Gao Yang expanded the territory of the Northern Qi empire towards the north and the south. The capital was Ye \u9134 (near modern Anyang \u5b89\u967d, Hebei). Compared with the Northern Zhou empire \u5317\u5468 (557-581) in the west and the Chen empire \u9673 (557-589) in the south, Gao Yang ruled over a relatively wealthy country, disposing of an impressive cultivated area, salt and iron industry and a ceramical industry.\n\nDuring the political disturbances of the 530es, general Gao Huan (posthumous title Emperor Shenwu \u5317\u9f4a\u795e\u6b66\u5e1d) controlled the political center of the Northern Wei dynasty. He installed Yuan Xiu \u5143\u4fee, and later Yuan Shanjian \u5143\u5584\u898b as the puppet emperors of the Eastern Wei empire. After his death in 547 his son Gao Yang (posthumous title Emperor Wenxuan \u5317\u9f4a\u6587\u5ba3\u5e1d, r. 550-559) took over the regency for the puppet emperors and proclaimed himself emperor of Qi in 550. His dynasty is by historians called the \"Northern Qi\", in order to avoid confusion with the Soutern Qi \u5357\u9f4a (479-502) that had been founded by the house of Xiao \u856d.\n\nGao Yang continued the conquest politics of his father and was able to defeat northern nomad tribes of the Kumoxi \u5eab\u83ab\u595a, Khitan \u5951\u4e39, and Rouran \u67d4\u7136, and also conquered parts of the Huai River \u6dee\u6c34 region.\n\nGao Yang perpetuated the equal-field system (juntianfa \u5747\u7530\u6cd5) invented by the Northern Wei administrators. All land within 30 li (ca. 15 kms) around the capital was state-owned common field (gongtian \u516c\u7530) and was distributed among the state officials and officers of the palace guard (yulin huben \u7fbd\u6797\u864e\u8cc1, both from the various Ta\u0263ba\u010d tribes) that had been resettled from around the old capital Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan). All land closer to the capital than 100 li was allotted to Chinese officials and officers. While these fields were distributed according to the official ranks, the fields in the rest of the country were distributed equally among the population. Yet there were some differences in the concretisation of field allotment, at least nominally, because the term beitian \u500d\u7530 \"double field\" was not any more used, as it had been under the Northern Wei. Slaves (nubi \u5974\u5a62) were also included in the calculation of the amount of field given to one household. The taxes, delivered in cloth and grain, were assessed according to \"one bed\" (i.e. one couple). Unmarried women only had to deliver half of the amount of cloth, so that a lot of persons declared themselves as not yet married.\n\nAfter the death of Gao Yang, his son Gao Yin \u9ad8\u6bb7 (known as the Deposed Emperor \u5317\u9f4a\u5ee2\u5e1d, r. 559-560) and Yang's brothers Gao Yan \u9ad8\u6f14 (Emperor Xiaozhao \u5317\u9f4a\u5b5d\u662d\u5e1d, r. 560) and Gao Zhan \u9ad8\u6e5b (Emperor Wucheng \u5317\u9f4a\u6b66\u6210\u5e1d, r. 561-564), as well as the latter's son Gao Wei \u9ad8\u7def (known as the Last Ruler \u5317\u9f4a\u5f8c\u4e3b, r. 564-576) neglected the business of active politics. Historiographers describe them as decadent and corrupt, as subject to pleasures that required a higher and higher tax income to be posed on the shoulders of the peasant population. High posts in the central government were only given to favourites, and local offices were only even sold to those offering sufficient money. The neighbouring state of the Northern Zhou grew stronger and was able to conquer the territory of the Northern Qi between 574 and 577. The Last Ruler abdicated after the capital had been conquered, and installed his son Gao Heng \u9ad8\u6046 as the new ruler (known as the Infant Ruler \u5317\u9f4a\u5e7c\u4e3b, r. 576-577). Gao Wei himself tried to escape to the court of the Chen dynasty in the south, but he was taken prisoner before he could flee.\n\nThe official dynastic history of the Northern Qi is the Beiqishu \u5317\u9f4a\u66f8 compiled by Li Baiyao \u674e\u767e\u85e5. Its history is also included in the official dynastic history Beishi \u5317\u53f2 written by Li Yanshou \u674e\u5ef6\u58fd.\n\nTable 1.

She was not Gao Dan's first wife, as Gao Dan, then the Duke of Changguang under eastern wei , married a daughter of Rouran's Khan Yujiul\u00fc Anluochen, titled the Princess Linhe, in 544 as his wife. (It is not known whether he later divorced the Princess Linhe or if she died. ) During the reign of Gao Dan's brother Emperor Wenxuan, the first emperor of northern qi , Gao Dan, then the Prince of Changguang, married Lady Hu as his wife. She bore him two sons, Gao Wei and Gao Yan.\n\nIn spring 568, Emperor Wucheng became ill, but after treatment by the medically-talented official Xu Zhicai (\u5f90\u4e4b\u624d), recovered. In winter 568, however, the illness retired, and he quickly tried to summon Xu, who was then the governor of Yan Province (\u5157\u5dde, roughly modern Jining, Shandong ), to the capital Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei ), but died before Xu could arrive. Thereafter, Empress Hu assumed the title of empress dowager.\n\nIn 565, Emperor Wucheng, believing in astrological signs that the imperial reign would be changed, passed the throne to Gao Wei. He took the title of Taishang Huang (retired emperor), while creating Empress Hu the title of Taishang Huanghou (\"retired empress\"). However, the matters of state were still decided by him, rather than the nine-year-old Gao Wei. During this period, Gao Yan was initially created the Prince of Dongping and then the Prince of Langye. Because of the retired emperor's and empress' great favor toward Gao Yan, he became exceedingly honored, and at times he would question his parents as to why his brother, who was weaker in personality than he was, was emperor. Emperor Wucheng and Empress Hu at times considered deposing Gao Wei and making Gao Yan emperor, but ultimately did not do so.\n\nEmpress Hu was alleged to be promiscuous, even during Emperor Wucheng's reign. She was said to have initially engaged in sexual relations with her eunuchs -- although, in light of their being previously castrated, the traditional historians used the term xiexia (\u893b\u72ce, \"immoral games\") rather than \"adultery\" to describe her acts with them. Later, with one of his officials, He Shikai, gaining great favors with him and allowed to enter the palace at all times, she engaged in a sexual relationship with He Shikai.\n\nGao Dan took the throne (as Emperor Wucheng) in 561 upon the death of another brother, Emperor Xiaozhao. He created her empress, and created her son Gao Wei crown prince. However, both Emperor Wucheng and she favored their other son, Gao Yan, more, believing him to be more intelligent and resolute.\n\nEmperor Wucheng entrusted the affairs of state to He Shikai, and he remained powerful after Emperor Wucheng's death. In spring 569, other officials, including Emperor Wucheng's cousin Gao Rui (\u9ad8\u53e1) the Prince of Zhao Commandery, Emperor Wucheng's brother Gao Run (\u9ad8\u6f64) the Prince of Fengyi, Emperor Wucheng's nephew Gao Yanzong (\u9ad8\u5ef6\u5b97) the Prince of Ande, Lou Dingyuan (\u5a41\u5b9a\u9060), and Gao Wenyao (\u9ad8\u6587\u9059), all suggested that He Shikai be sent out of the capital to become a provincial governor. Initially, Empress Dowager Hu felt compelled to agree, but after further consultation with He Shikai, she instead killed Gao Rui and exiled Lou, while keeping He Shikai in power. Meanwhile, her lady in waiting, Gao Wei's wet nurse Lu Lingxuan, was also becoming powerful, as she gained Empress Dowager Hu's favor by flattering Empress Dowager Hu.\n\nIn 571, Gao Yan, offended by He Shikai, who feared his power and wanted to demote him to a provincial governorship, arrested He Shikai and executed him. However, when his associates, including Empress Dowager Hu's brother-in-law Feng Zicong (\u99ae\u5b50\u742e), encouraged him to further seize the reins of imperial government, he hesitated -- and his troops dissipated when the powerful general Hul\u00fc Guang, the father of Gao Wei's wife Empress Hul\u00fc, refused to side with him. Empress Dowager Hu had Feng executed, but tried to preserve Gao Yan's life by keeping him with her at all times. However, at Lu's instigation, Gao Wei decided to kill Gao Yan, and did so in winter 571 by tricking Empress Dowager Hu into believing that he was only inviting Gao Yan on a hunt. Subsequently, to placate Empress Dowager Hu, Gao Wei posthumously honored Gao Yan as \"Emperor Gong'ai of Chu\" and honored Gao Yan's wife Princess Li as the Empress of Chu.\n\nAfter He Shikai's death, Empress Dowager Hu engaged in an affair with the Buddhist monk Tanxian (\u66c7\u737b), who served as the director of Buddhist affairs in the imperial government -- and the affair became so well-known among monks that some monks joking referred to Tanxian as Taishang Huang. The rumors reached Gao Wei, but he initially did not believe them. Once, when he was visiting Empress Dowager Hu, however, he saw two \"nuns\" attending her and was aroused by them, so he ordered them to have sexual relations with him -- and only upon ordering so did he discover that they were, in fact, men. He thereafter investigated and discovered Empress Dowager Hu's affair with Tanxian, and he put Tanxian and three female close associates of Empress Dowager Hu to death. Also in winter 571, he put her under house arrest and refused to allow her to meet with the nobles. (The official Zu Ting subsequently suggested deposing Empress Dowager Hu and making Lu empress dowager instead, but Gao Wei never actually followed that suggestion. )\n\nEmpress Dowager Hu, embarrassed at her disgrace, tried to placate Gao Wei. She invited the daughter of her brother Hu Changren (\u80e1\u9577\u4ec1) to the palace to live with her, and she beautified Lady Hu greatly and intentionally showcased her to Gao Wei. Gao Wei was pleased with Lady Hu and took her as a favored concubine. After Gao Wei, fearing that Hul\u00fc Guang was about to rebel, killed him in 572, he deposed Empress Hul\u00fc. Empress Hu wanted to make Consort Hu empress, but as she did not have sufficient persuasive power over Gao Wei, had to in turn flatter Lu to try to get her to help. Lu wanted her adoptive daughter Consort Mu Sheli, who already bore Gao Wei one son, Gao Heng, to be empress, but as she saw that Gao Wei favored Consort Hu, she went along with Empress Dowager Hu's desire and recommended Consort Hu. In fall 572, Gao Wei created Consort Hu empress. However, Lu still planned to make Consort Mu empress, and in winter 572, after further persuasion by Lu, Gao Wei initially made Consort Mu empress as well -- as \"right empress\" while Empress Hu became \"left empress. \"\n\nHowever, Lu was not satisfied, and this time she would trick Empress Dowager Hu. Around the new year 573, she falsely stated to Empress Dowager Hu that Empress Hu had told Gao Wei, \"The empress dowager's behavior is immoral and should not be followed. \" Empress Dowager Hu was incensed, and without verifying the information, she ordered Empress Hu be expelled from the palace, and then had Gao Wei depose her. From that point on, Lu and her son Mu Tipo dominated the palace, and it was said that even Empress Dowager Hu was under their control. Little is known about Empress Dowager Hu's activities for the next several years.\n\nIn 576, Emperor Wu of northern zhou launched a major attack on northern qi, and by spring 577 reached Yecheng's vicinity. In order to try to change his fortunes, Gao Wei passed the throne to his young son Gao Heng and took the title of Taishang Huang. Empress Dowager Hu thereafter became grand empress dowager. Soon, however, with northern zhou forces arriving, Gao Wei took his household and tried to flee east to either gather troops or flee to chen dynasty. They were captured and subsequently taken to northern zhou's capital Chang'an. northern qi's territory was entirely taken by northern zhou."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wenwang", "page_content": "son Zhougong son Wuwang ...(Show more)\n\nWenwang, Wade-Giles romanization Wen-wang, also called Xi Bo, (flourished 11th century bc, China), father of Ji Fa (the Wuwang emperor), the founder of the Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 bc) and one of the sage rulers regarded by Confucian historians as a model king.\n\nWen was the ruler of Zhou, one of the semibarbaric states on the western frontier of China, long a battleground between the civilized Chinese and nomadic invaders.

Her husband was Emperor Xiaozhao (Gao Yan).\n\nHer father, Yuan Man (\u5143\u883b), was an official during the preceding Eastern Wei as a member of its imperial clan and continued to serve in the Northern Qi government as a midlevel official. One of her uncles, Yuan Cha, was a regent of Northern Wei prior to its division into Eastern Wei and Western Wei. She married Gao Yan while or before he was the Prince of Changshan under the reign of his brother, Emperor Wenxuan, the first emperor of Northern Qi, and she carried the title of Princess of Changshan. They had one son, Gao Bainian. In 559, when Emperor Wenxuan ordered a general execution of members of the Northern Wei imperial Yuan clan, Yuan Man and his household were one of the few households spared, on account of Gao Yan's intercession. Emperor Wenxuan granted Yuan Man's household a new surname, Buliugu (\u6b65\u516d\u5b64), but Yuan Man and Empress Yuan appeared to abandon the name once Emperor Wenxuan died later in the year.\n\nEmperor Wenxuan was succeeded by his son, Emperor Wenxuan. In 560, the prime minister, Yang Yin, suspicious of the authority that Gao Yan and his brother Gao Zhan, the Prince of Changguang, wielded as the emperor's uncles, tried to strip them of power. Instead, Gao Yan and Gao Zhan set an ambush for Yang and his associates, capturing and then executing them. Gao Yan took over control of the imperial government and, later in the year, his mother, Grand Empress Dowager Lou Zhaojun, issued an edict deposing Emperor Fei and making Gao Yan emperor (as Emperor Xiaozhao).\n\nEmperor Xiaozhao made Princess Yuan empress and made her son, Gao Bainian, crown prince. In fall 561, while on a hunt near the secondary capital Jinyang (\u6649\u967d, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), Emperor Xiaozhao fell off his horse and suffered severe injuries. Believing that he was near death but believing that Gao Bainian to be too young to take the throne, at age five, he issued an edict giving the throne to Gao Zhan. He died the same day, and Gao Zhan took the throne as Emperor Wucheng.\n\nEmpress Yu accompanied Emperor Xiaozhao's funeral train to the capital, Yecheng (\u9134\u57ce, in modern Handan, Hebei). Emperor Wucheng heard rumors that the empress possessed medicines of great value, and he sent eunuchs to demand those medicines from her. She either could not or did not turn them over, and Emperor Wucheng had the eunuchs humiliate her. As she was his sister-in-law, not mother, he did not honor her as empress dowager, but only referred to her as Empress Xiaozhao and had her housed at a subsidiary palace, Shuncheng Palace (\u9806\u6210\u5bae). He made her son, Gao Bainian, the former crown prince, the Prince of Leling.\n\nIn 564, with astrological signs showing ill fortune to the emperor, Emperor Wucheng wanted to deflect the ill fortune onto Gao Bainian, and he had Gao Bainian battered and then beheaded. After Gao Bainian's death, Emperor Wucheng kept Empress Yuan under close guard, and she was not even able to communicate with her father. After one incident, when she was found to possess letters from her father and brother somehow despite her guarded status, her father, Yuan Man, was removed from his office but was not killed.\n\nIn 577, Northern Qi fell to rival Northern Zhou. She, along with other members of the Gao clan, were moved to the Northern Zhou capital of Chang'an, and she took up residence in the Northern Zhou palace following the subsequent slaughter of members of the Gao clan by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou. After Yang Jian became the regent of Northern Zhou in 580, he allowed her to return to Northern Qi's former territory.

In 534, Yuan Baoju, then the Prince of Nanyang, followed his cousin Emperor Xiaowu in fleeing from the capital Luoyang to Chang'an, after a fallout between Emperor Xiaowu and the paramount general Gao Huan. However, Emperor Xiaowu's relationship to the general that he then depended on, Yuwen Tai, soon deteriorated as well, and around the new year 535, Yuwen Tai poisoned Emperor Xiaowu to death, making Yuan Baoju emperor (as Emperor Wen). As Gao Huan had, late in 534, made Yuan Shanjian the son of Emperor Wen's cousin Yuan Dan (\u5143\u4eb6) the Prince of Qinghe emperor (as Emperor Xiaojing), thus establishing eastern wei, Emperor Wen was known as western wei's first emperor, formalizing the division. Emperor Wen's relationship with Yuwen appeared cordial, but he was unable to exercise much real power.\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground Yuan Baoju was born in 507. His father Yuan Yu (\u5143\u6109), the Prince of Jingzhao, was the son of Emperor Xiaowen and a younger brother of the reigning Emperor Xuanwu. His mother was recorded as Yuan Yu's concubine Lady Yang. (Some historical records indicate that Lady Li was initially surnamed Yang, and only became known as Lady Li after Yuan Yu, wanting her to be part of a prominent family, had the aristocratic family Li adopt her. ) He had three other brothers, at least one of whom, Yuan Baoyue (\u5143\u5bf6\u6708), was older, and born of Lady Li.\n\nYuan Yu favored Lady Li but not his wife, Princess Yu, a sister to Emperor Xuanwu's wife Empress Yu. Consequently, Empress Yu once summoned Lady Li to the palace, beat her severely, and then forced her to become a Buddhist nun. Only after the intercession of Empress Yu's father Yu Jing (\u4e8e\u52c1) was Lady Li returned to Yuan Yu. Meanwhile, in 508, Yuan Yu himself was punished by Emperor Xuanwu for corruption. He was caned 50 times and demoted to the governorship of Ji Province (\u5180\u5dde, modern central Hebei ). In anger, he rebelled at the capital of Ji Province, Xindu (\u4fe1\u90fd, in modern Hengshui, Hebei ), alleging falsely that Emperor Xuanwu's uncle Gao Zhao had murdered the emperor and declaring himself emperor. Yuan Yu's rebellion was soon defeated by the general Li Ping (\u674e\u5e73), and during his being delivered to the capital Luoyang, Gao had him killed. At that time, Lady Li was pregnant, and she was permitted to give birth and then was executed. Emperor Xuanwu did not execute any of Yuan Yu's sons, but had them, including Yuan Baoju, put under arrest at Zongzheng Temple (\u5b97\u6b63\u5bfa). Assuming that Lady Li and Lady Yang were in fact the same person, this also meant that Yuan Baoju grew up without either parent. He and his brothers remained at Zongzheng Temple and were released only after Emperor Xuanwu's death in 515. During the reign of Emperor Xuanwu's son Emperor Xiaoming, Emperor Xiaoming's mother Empress Dowager Hu posthumously recreated Yuan Yu the Prince of Lintao, and Yuan Baoju and his brothers then observed a mourning period for their parents. Yuan Baoyue inherited the title, but Yuan Baoju did not possess any titles at the moment, although he was made a general. Despite Empress Dowager Hu's rehabiilitation of Yuan Yu, however, Yuan Baoju was not impressed at her toleration of corruption, particularly by her lovers, and he secretly plotted with Emperor Xiaoming to have her lovers killed. When this plot was discovered, he was stripped of the office he held. In 525, he married his wife Lady Yifu, the daughter of a moderately prominent aristocratic family. (In his youth, Yuan Baoju was described by the Book of Wei as frivolous, alcoholic, and sexually immoral, but this description is highly suspect in that the Book of Wei was written by Wei Shou, an official of eastern wei, the rival of western wei, for which Yuan Baoju would eventually become emperor. ) In 528, Emperor Xiaoming created him the Marquess of Shao County, and in 530, Emperor Xiaozhuang created him the Prince of Nanyang.\n\nIn 532, after several years of civil war, the victorious general Gao Huan made Yuan Baoju's cousin Yuan Xiu the Prince of Pingyang emperor (as Emperor Xiaowu). Emperor Xiaowu was not happy about Gao's hold on the military, and he entered into alliances with the independent generals Yuwen Tai and Heba Sheng (\u8cc0\u62d4\u52dd), seeking to resist Gao's control. Yuan Baoju served in Emperor Xiaowu's administration as a general. In 534, Emperor Xiaowu planned to act against Gao, but Gao discovered his plan and instead marched on Luoyang. Emperor Xiaowu decided to flee to Yuwen's territory, and Yuan Baoju accompanied Emperor Xiaowu in doing so, arriving at Chang'an in late 534. Also accompanying Emperor Xiaowu was Yuan Baoju's sister Yuan Mingyue (\u5143\u660e\u6708) -- who was in an incestuous relationship with Emperor Xiaowu. Yuwen did not tolerate Emperor Xiaowu's incestuous relationships with Yuan Mingyue and two other cousins, and eventually he had Yuan Mingyue killed. Emperor Xiaowu became angry, and his relationship with Yuwen deteriorated. Around the new year 535, Yuwen poisoned him to death.\n\nInitially, Yuwen was poised to make Emperor Xiaowu's nephew Yuan Zan (\u5143\u8d0a) the Prince of Guangping the new emperor. However, under suggestion of Yuan Shun (\u5143\u9806) the Prince of Puyang, who argued that Yuan Zan was too young, Yuwen changed his mind and made Yuan Baoju, then 27, emperor instead (as Emperor Wen). As Gao had earlier declared Yuan Shanjian, the son of Yuan Baoju's cousin Yuan Dan (\u5143\u4eb6) the Prince of Qinghe, emperor, Gao's territory became known as eastern wei, with Yuan Shanjian (Emperor Xiaojing) as emperor, and Yuwen's territory became known as western wei, with Emperor Wen as emperor.\n\n\n\nReign Yuwen Tai publicly deferred to Emperor Wen on most matters, but Yuwen held actual power, with Emperor Wen not being able to exercise much independent authority. Throughout the early years of his reign, there were serious doubts as to whether western wei would survive, as eastern wei was then the much stronger state, and Gao Huan made repeated attempts to conquer western wei. However, with Yuwen and other generals capably defending the territory, western wei was able to withstand Gao's assaults.\n\nIn 535, Emperor Wen posthumously honored his father Yuan Yu as Emperor Wenjing, and he posthumously honored his mother Lady Yang as empress. He created his wife Princess Yifu empress, and her son Yuan Qin crown prince. His marriage with Empress Yifu was said to be a happy one, as she was virtuous and beautiful, and Emperor Wen respected her greatly. She bore him 12 children, although only Yuan Qin and Yuan Wu (\u5143\u620a) the Prince of Wudu survived infancy.\n\nIn 538, with western wei under the threat of attack by Rouran, Yuwen first tried to alleviate the situation by marrying a daughter of a member of the imperial clan to Yujiul\u00fc Tahan (\u90c1\u4e45\u95ad\u5854\u5bd2), the brother of Rouran's Chiliantoubingdoufa Khan Yujiul\u00fc Anagui, but then, believing that to be insufficient, he asked Emperor Wen to divorce Empress Yifu and marry Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter. Emperor Wen agreed, and divorced Empress Yifu, making her a Buddhist nun. He then married Yujiul\u00fc Anagui's daughter and created her empress. For a while, this brought peace with Rouran.\n\nLater in 538, with western wei then (temporariily) controlling the old northern wei capital Luoyang, but with Luoyang under attack, Emperor Wen (who had wanted to visit the imperial ancestral tombs in Luoyang) and Yuwen led troops to reinforce Luoyang's defenses, leaving the official Zhou Huida (\u5468\u60e0\u9054) and Crown Prince Qin in Chang'an. However, with the forces engaged in battle, Emperor Wen eventually became stuck at Hengnong (\u6046\u8fb2, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan ), when Chang'an was taken by rebelling former eastern wei troops who had been taken captive previously by western wei, forcing Zhou and Crown Prince Qin to flee as well. Yuwen was eventually able to disengage after abandoning Luoyang, and he put down the rebellion, allowing Emperor Wen to return to Chang'an.\n\nAlthough the former Empress Yifu had been deposed and made a Buddhist nun, Empress Yujiul\u00fc was still not happy about her presence in the capital. in 540, Emperor Wen therefore made Yuan Wu the governor of Qin Province (\u79e6\u5dde, roughly modern Tianshui, Gansu ), and had Empress Yifu accompany Yuan Wu to Qin Province. However, because he still hoped to welcome her back to the palace one day, he secretly told her to keep her hair uncut, rather than shaved like a Buddhist nun. At this time, however, Rouran made a major attack on western wei, and many officials thought that the attack was on behalf of Empress Yujiul\u00fc. Emperor Wen felt compelled to order Empress Yifu to commit suicide, and he did. Soon thereafter, Empress Yujiul\u00fc, who was pregnant, died during childbirth.\n\nIn 548, Yuwen and Yuan Qin were on a grand tour of the provinces when Emperor Wen grew ill, and when they heard the news, Yuwen returned to Chang'an quickly, although by the time they returned, Emperor Wen had recovered.\n\nIn 549, Emperor Wen issued an edict\u2014probably as Yuwen requested\u2014ordering that the names of the ethnic Xianbei, changed to Han names during the reign of Emperor Xiaowen, be changed back to the original Xianbei names.\n\nIn 550, Gao Huan's son Gao Yang forced eastern wei's Emperor Xiaojing to yield the throne to him, ending eastern wei and starting northern qi (as its Emperor Wenxuan). Emperor Wen therefore became the only claimant to the northern wei throne. Yuwen, declaring northern qi a rebel state, launched a major attack, but Gao Yang himself commanded a large army to defend against the attack, and western wei not only did not make gains, but lost a number of provinces to northern qi.\n\nIn 551, Emperor Wen died and was buried with honors due an emperor, with Empress Yujiul\u00fc, although eventually Empress Yifu was buried with him. (It is not clear whether she displaced Empress Yujiul\u00fc or not. ) Yuan Qin succeeded him (as Emperor Fei).\n\n\n\nEra names Datong (\u5927\u7d71 d\u00e0 t\u01d2ng) 535-551\n\n"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/chen.yueyi/2503023", "page_content": "Chen Yueyi\n\nGeneral emperor\n\n565 (age 85)\n\nChen Shanti was initially a servant of the Northern Wei general Erzhu Zhao, and after Erzhu\"s defeat by Gao Huan became a servant to Gao. After Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou destroyed Northern Qi in 577, Chen Shanti became a Northern Zhou general and carried the title of Duke of Xiyang. In 579, Chen Yueyi was selected to be an imperial consort for Emperor Xuan, with the title of Defei (\u5fb7\u5983). Subsequently, as he wanted to create one more empress, he changed her title to Tianzhong Da Huanghou (\u5929\u4e2d\u5927\u7687\u540e) so that her Tianzuo Da Huanghou title could be given to Empress Yuchi Chifan. Among the empresses, she was said to be closest to Empress Yuan Leshang, as they entered the palace at the same time and were the same age, and they were also both favored by Emperor Xuan. Emperor Xuan died in summer 580, and Empress Yang\"s father Yang Jian became regent. According to both the Book of Zhou and History of Northern Dynasties, she was still alive as of the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang (626-649), but nothing further was recorded in either of those two official histories about her."}]}
