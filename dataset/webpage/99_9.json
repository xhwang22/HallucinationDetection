How did the transition of Sikkim from a protectorate of India to an integral part of the Indian Union take place? The answers have to be viewed in the context of this small and exotic north-eastern border state's relations over nearly a 100 years, first with the British and later with the Indian governments. Following is a concise political history of Sikkim:\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnglo-Chinese Convention of 1890: According to this convention arranged mutually between the representatives of the British Crown and the Emperor of China, Sikkim was allegedly recognized as a protectorate of the British Government. Neither Sikkim nor Tibet were consulted and were not party to the agreement.\n\nThe Chamber of Princes, 1922: The fact that Sikkim was a member of Indian Chamber of Princes is a legal issue that was resurrected at the time of Sikkim's annexation. When, under Section 7 of the Indian Independence Act of 1947, the suzerainty of the British Crown over the Indian states lapsed, all members of the Princes' Chamber technically became independent states. The Indian princely states then merged with the Dominion of India by signing instruments of accession and merger agreements. The Indian Governments claim was that Sikkim, since it was a member of the Chamber of Princes, was in fact another princely state of India. The Chogyal's legal adviser claimed that Sikkim was only formally a member of the Chamber, a body which possessed no executive powers, and that Sikkim in fact observed special treaty relations with the British Crown.\n\nIndo-Sikkim Treaty, 1950: This treaty signed between the Maharaja of Sikkim, Sir Tashi Namgyal, and a representative of the Indian Government, recognized Sikkim as a protectorate of India. Sikkim's defence, external affairs and communication requirements were to be looked after by India but the kingdom was to \"enjoy autonomy in regard to its internal affairs\".\n\nIn 1952 the Sikkim Legislative Assembly was to consist of 17 members, five of whom were nominated by the Maharaja. An Indian political representative was appointed in Gangtok in place of the British political officer. A memorandum of the Government of India's views on a constitutional scheme for Sikkim later proclaimed that \"it was now necessary or desirable that there should be a written constitution....\"\n\nMay 8 Agreement of 1973: This was an agreement entered into by the Chogyal, the Government of India and leaders of the political parties of Sikkim following complete breakdown of the law and order situation. There had been serious outbursts of violence in Gangtok following agitations for \"a more democratic constitution\" and \"greater legislative and executive powers for the elected representatives of the people\". Both were provided in the Agreement. In addition, the Indian Government was \"requested\" to take \"responsibility\" for law and order and appoint a chief executive or head of administration in Sikkim. Elections on the basis of one-man one-vote were introduced. The Indian chief executive held complete administrative authority. If any difference of opinion rose between him and the Chogyal, it was to be \"referred to the political officer in Sikkim, who shall obtain the advise of the Government of India, which shall be binding\".\n\nadvertisement\n\nDraft Constitution: Following the May 8 Agreement, the Indian Government sent a constitutional adviser to draft a constitution of Sikkim which, the Chogyal's legal adviser claims, was a revved up version of the May 8 Agreement. This draft of the constitution was christened the Government of Sikkim Bill of 1974 and, despite the Chogyal's serious objections to the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, was presented to the Assembly and passed on June 28, 1974. The Chogyal alleges that whenever he protested to Mrs Gandhi, she replied: \"Why don't you give it a try.\"\n\nIn the context, his objections were over ruled, he was not given time to consider the matter and the Indian chief executive pushed through the Bill with eight amendments. One of these amendments gave the right to the Assembly to participate in \"the political institutions of India\" which were never defined.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOpposition leaders today claim that they were veritably coerced into signing the bill which became the Government of Sikkim Act of 1974. This was following the Assembly elections in which the Kazi's party won an overwhelming majority.\n\nControversy: The introduction of the 36th Amendment Bill in the Indian Parliament, which sought the merger of Sikkim with India, aroused a deep controversy in the national press. The Hindustan Times of September 4, 1974 lamented its lack of justification and \"the extraordinary haste with which this far-reaching measure is being hustled through Parliament\". At the end of the same month, B. G. Verghese, the editor of the paper, wrote his famous editorial on the subject called \"Kanchen junga, Here We Come\".\n\n\"Elsewhere,\" he wrote, \"protectorates are graduating to independence and colonies are marching to freedom. In Sikkim, a protectorate is moving to freedom within India' by annexation through Constitutional legerdemain. The worst suspicions about the manner in which the protector has seduced its helpless and inoffensive ward, with some genuine and much synthetic drama, will now find confirmation ... the Indian government is not going to be able to persuade the world that Sikkim's annexation to India represents the will of the Sikkimese people.\" The move met with the censure of almost all other major Indian papers. China protested loudly, possibly for other reasons, and the Chogyal's legal adviser stated that it was not Sikkim which was becoming the 22nd state of India, but that India was becoming the first state of Sikkim. In the light of the Emergency that followed, her warning held an element of prophecy.\n\nadvertisement\n\nClashes: Early in 1975, the auditor general of Sikkim, M. M. Rasailly filed a civil suit challenging the constitutional validity of the Government of Sikkim Act. Clashes between the Chogyal's sympathizers and Kazi's followers became intense. For obscure reasons, a military operation was launched on the Chogyal's palace on April 9, 1975. Two soldiers, one of the Indian army and another of the Sikkim Guards-a force of about 300 men controlled by the Chogyal -were killed. The force was disbanded and the Chogyal was placed under house arrest. Earlier, his sister was placed under house arrest in New Delhi and her houses in Calcutta and Gangtok raided.\n\nThe chief executive then wrote to the Chogyal requesting him to summon a meeting of the Assembly to discuss the Central court's injunction to the civil suit which forbade the election of Sikkimese members to the Indian Parliament and to discuss matters relating to the Chogyal and his family. The Chogyal refused on the ground that the matter was sub judice. Consequently, the Assembly met on April 10, 1975 and abolished the institution of the Chogyal. It declared Sikkim \"a constituent unit of India, enjoying a democratic and fully responsible government\". A referendum was sought five days later for the approval of the people. This special poll, which the Chogyal terms \"illegal\", was endorsed by over 60,000 votes with 1,496 against. The poll was conducted by the executive fiat of the chief executive.\n\nOn April 22, 1975, the Government of India introduced the 36th Amendment to the Constitution making Sikkim the 22nd state of India with effect from April 26."}, {"url": "https://eurasiantimes.com/sikkim-history-india-annexed/", "page_content": "Who Planned the Sikkim Annexation by India? Sikkim, as we know today, is a beautiful part of the Northeastern region of India. But the history of Sikkim goes back to 1642 when Sikkim was not a part of India and was then an independent Kingdom, ruled by the monarchs. On 16th May 1975, Sikkim became a part of India followed by revisions to the Indian constitution to accommodate the earlier international treaties between India and Sikkim.\n\nBest Friends India-Israel Relations in Trouble Over Iranian Nuclear Deal?\n\nThe annexation of Sikkim by India is noted as a historical event, that changed both forever. The process of annexing the two had started much earlier but it was on 16th May 1975 that the official annexation was documented.\n\nBefore the annexation of Sikkim by India and much before the disputes between India-China and the Tibet region, the Himalayan Kingdom, already enjoyed a rich past and a dynamic culture. The monarchy and its first mentions date back to the Indian mythological stories and versions.\n\nIndo-China Border to be Upgraded, post Doklam\n\nThe History of Sikkim\n\nOne of the very first mentions of the kingdom is in Hindu mythology, with Lord Shiva appearing as a hunter at the Kirateshwar temple in Western Sikkim region. Following the dispute between the Yellow and Red Hats in Tibet, back in the 17th century, the Bhutias Tibetan community was forced to Sikkim for refuge.\n\nIn 1642, the kingdom got it\u2019s very first Chogyal, the King, consecrated by the three great lamas of the South, West and North region to Western Sikkim. The king and the three lamas proceeded to annex the Chumbi Valley, what we call Darjeeling today and also parts of the East of Nepal. The Chogyal then appointed 12 ministers and divided the kingdom into 12 different administrations. Although the disputes between the Tibetan communities- Bhutia, Lepchas, Limbus and Magars continued for a long time, the Magars soon left the kingdom after being defeated in a battle.\n\nUnderstanding the Burning Rohingya Issue and the Impact on India and China\n\nThe Kingdom existed in peace for a long time, before the invasion of Nepal and Bhutan disrupted the peace. However, when the British rule came to India, Sikkim allied with India against the common enemy- Nepal. This was followed by an attack by Nepal on Sikkim and then the retaliatory Anglo-Nepalese war beginning in 1814\n\nAnnexation of Sikkim by British India\n\nAfter the signing of the treaties between Nepal and the British, the British looked forward to a trade route with links in Tibet. This new trade route was to be an offshoot to the Silk Road that ran through the kingdom. The need for this new trade route was also expected to curb the growing influence of Russia in Tibet. The Sikkim-India ties weakened after the British levied new taxation norms in the Morang region. This was followed by more weakening of ties after the British secured the cessation of Darjeeling in 1835 to British Sikkim. However, independent kingdom of Sikkim continued to exist alongside the British Sikkim.\n\nIn 1918, the kingdom restored its independent status with a guarantee from the British rule, which was then transferred to the Indian government after Indian independence in 1947.\n\nWhy is Japan Unhappy with Bullet Train Project in India?\n\nWhile India was under the British rule, Sikkim was an independent kingdom with a sovereign status. Before the India-China war of 1962, India and the kingdom had an agreement where the kingdom was an \u2018Indian Protectorate\u2019 and Delhi managed the international affairs, defence and communication for the kingdom, while it continued to be an independent kingdom. This agreement was signed by the then ruler of Sikkim, Chogyal Tashi, and former PM Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nPost the India-China war, the scenario changed, as the Nathula pass that joined the kingdom and Tibet was under a continuous state of war. The kingdom then became a security hazard for the Indian government. It was in 1972 that the modification of the kingdom\u2019s status was suggested as \u2018permanent association\u2019. This was the turning point and, and the beginning of India\u2019s efforts to annex the kingdom of Sikkim. The decision was met with public unrest and a lot of disputes and cry for peace, before the final annexation of Sikkim by India.\n\nOn 14 April 1975, a referendum was held, in which Sikkim voted to merge with India. Sikkim became the 22nd Indian State and on 16 May 1975, and Sikkim officially became an Indian state.\n\nOther News:"}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/16/archives/sikkim-becomes-an-indian-state-monarchy-ended.html", "page_content": "NEW DELHI, Friday, May 16 (AP)\u2014India formally annexed Sikkim today, making the Himalayan kingdom the country's 22d state.\n\nPresident Fakhruddin All Ahmed completed the absorption of the 2,745\u2010square\u2010mile territory bordering Tibet by ratifying a constitutional amendment that makes Sikkim's 200,000 inhabitants Indian citizens and its once\u2010absolute ruler a commoner.\n\nThe Indian Parliament approved the amendment last month by overwhelming majorities, with opposition coming only from militant Communists who wanted the monarchy abolished but favored Sikkim's retaining internal autonomy without becoming a full state.\n\nThe demand for statehood originated among antiroyalists in Sikkim, who gained power after an uprising two years ago against the Chogyal, Palden Thondup Namgyal, the last hereditary monarch in a dynasty that goes back 300 years."}, {"url": "https://www.peepultree.world/livehistoryindia/story/eras/annexation-of-sikkim", "page_content": "Bergdorf Goodman on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue is one of the most exclusive luxury goods stores in the world. On 11th November 1971, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of fashionable New York society trooped in, to attend a very special fashion show and dinner in honour of \u2018Their Majesties, the King and Queen of Sikkim\u2019. Outside, the Sikkimese flag flew on both sides of Fifth Avenue. The New York Times reported:\n\n\u201cAs the formally clad guests arrived, they were handed white chiffon scarves to unfold, place over their own two outstretched hands and then hand over (while bowing, of course) to the monarchs who then handed them back again. The king explained the ceremony. \u2018The white scarf signifies purity,\u2019 he said, \u2018so when you give the scarves, you come with a pure heart\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe guests sipped champagne while Sikkimese music played in the background. Over the next two days, similar galas were held at the Colony Club and Waldorf Astoria in New York. The NYT gushed: \u201c She's [The Queen] using fashion to bring her country attention.\u201d\n\nIronically, King Palden Thondup Namgyal (1923-1982) and his American Queen, Hope Cooke, did not need fashion to draw attention to their kingdom, for, as Sikkimese gowns glided through New York ballrooms, Sikkim was at the epicentre of what many believed would be the start of a \u201cThird World War\u201d.\n\nGeneral Yahya Khan of Pakistan had launched a genocide in East Pakistan and millions of East Bengali refugees had flooded India. Both China and the United States, allies of Pakistan, made threatening moves, with China even moving some troops to the Chumbi Valley, just north of Sikkim. less than a month later, in December 1971, the Bangladesh Liberation War would begin.\n\n\u2018Himalayan Marie Antoinette\u2019 , the headlines of the news journal Himalayan Observer screamed, referring to Sikkim\u2019s Queen. The comparison with the deposed French monarch on the eve of the French Revolution was perhaps apt, for within four years, the monarchy would be abolished in Sikkim and the kingdom would merge with India.\n\nThe backstory of Sikkim\u2019s accession to India on 16th May 1975, involving ancient curses, tribal rivalries, foreign consorts, spy agencies and Indian backroom politics, makes it as riveting as a fictional novel. Strangely, few in India are aware of it.\n\nThe Curse of the Namgyals\n\nSikkim\u2019s last ruler, Palden Thondup Namgyal, would not have become King had it not been for an accident at the western end of the Himalayan range. On 20th December 1941, his elder brother, Crown Prince Paljor, a Royal Air Force pilot, was killed in a plane crash in Peshawar. Many in Sikkim believed it was the result of an ancient \u2018curse\u2019 on the Namgyal family, according to which the firstborn rarely succeeded to the throne.\n\nThe \u2018curse\u2019 as well as the events leading to Sikkim\u2019s merger with India, trace their origins to the bitter rivalry between Sikkim\u2019s three main communities \u2013 the Lepchas, the Bhutias and the ethnic Nepalis.\n\nFar back in antiquity, the mountainous region of Sikkim was inhabited by the Lepcha tribe. Then, in the 17th century CE, immigrants from Tibet known as the \u2018Bhutias\u2019 settled in the region. The Buddhist lamas wanted to convert the region into a Buddhist kingdom, and as a result in 1642 CE, Phutsong Namgyal was appointed as the first King or \u2018Chogyal\u2019 of Sikkim. A few years later, the Lepchas and Bhutias sealed a pact at a place called \u2018Krabi Lungstock\u2019, where they agreed to coexist in peace. The Lepchas claimed that the Namgyals had promised in the agreement that they would renounce Buddhism and worship the Animist Lepcha gods. Their failure to do so had cursed the family.\n\nFor centuries, the Buddhist Namgyal kingdom accepted the religious jurisdiction of Tibet, very similar to the authority of the Vatican over Roman Catholic churches in different countries. The Sikkimese court also had very close matrimonial and cultural ties with Tibetan aristocrats. These medieval links were the genesis of China\u2019s claim over Sikkim as an extension of Tibet.\n\nThe traditional Tibetan name for the region was \u2018Denjong\u2019 or the \u2018Valley of Rice\u2019. The name \u2018Sikkim\u2019 is derived from \u2018Su Khyim\u2019 or the \u2018New Palace\u2019 of the Namgyals in the language of the Limbu tribe. Over time, the entire kingdom became known as Sikkim. The Sikkimese had two very powerful and expansionist neighbour\u2019s \u2013 Bhutan to the east and Nepal to its west. This explains the peculiar, elongated shape of the kingdom\u2019s territories.\n\nIn the 19th century, Sikkim had to deal with a new power, the British East India Company, which had established its rule in India. The British were interested in Sikkim because of its strategic importance, because through the region lay the easiest route to the heart of Tibet. An opportunity arose during the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16, when the Sikkimese approached the British for help against the Nepalese. In exchange, the British and the Sikkimese signed the Treaty of Titalia in 1817, which made the transit of British goods duty-free in Sikkim.\n\nIn 1835, the British secured the cession of Darjeeling from Sikkim as a \u2018sanitorium\u2019 for British officers. Following further disturbances in 1861, the British seized southern Sikkim, comprising the Morung and Terai regions, and made Sikkim a \u2018British Protectorate\u2019. It is this Treaty of Tumlong (1861) that would govern relations between Sikkim and India till 1975.\n\nDisturbance in the Himalayas\n\nIn 1947, when India\u2019s Princely States were asked to merge with either India or Pakistan, the two Himalayan kingdoms of Sikkim and Bhutan remained exceptions. Although they were slightly different from the others, Sikkim was considered an Indian Princely State with membership of the \u2018Chamber of Princes\u2019. Bhutan, on the other hand, was a \u2018Protectorate\u2019. But unlike other rulers, Sir Tashi Namgyal , Thondup\u2019s father, was never asked to sign the merger agreement.\n\n\u2013 In early 1947, Nehru pushed through a resolution in the Indian Constituent Assembly, agreeing that Sikkim and Bhutan were \u201cnot Indian States\u201d and acknowledging that, since they constituted a \u201cspecial problem\u201d, their future should be negotiated separately.\n\nIronically, the Namgyals\u2019 bid for separation suffered from the same obstacle as the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Maharaja of Kashmir \u2013 the support of the majority of the population. According to the 1941 Census, Sikkim\u2019s population comprised 15,000 Lepchas, 17,000 Bhutias and 1,05,000 ethnic Nepalese. While the Bhutia-Lepcha aristocracy dominated the administration and land ownership, the ethnic Nepalese, who were almost 75-77 per cent of the population, had little or no rights.\n\nThese ethnic Nepalese (not just Gorkhas and belonging to different tribes from Nepal) had been settled here as a part of a British policy from the 1860s onwards, to protect and ring-fence Sikkim against a potential Tibetan invasion. Over time, mass migration and settlement turned them into a majority.\n\nThe majority of the ethnic Nepalese were poor peasants and labourers toiling under the Lepcha-Bhutia zamindars. Sikkim was ruled by the Chogyal with the help of his councillors. In December 1947, Tashi Tshering, a former clerk in the Political Office, launched an agitation for democratic rule. The main demands of this movement were the abolition of the Zamindari, establishment of democratic rule and the merger with India.\n\nFor the next two years, the agitation continued and the situation began to deteriorate in Sikkim. Finally, buckling under pressure, a democratic government was set up on 9th May 1948, with Tashi Tshering being appointed Chief Minister. But after just 28 days, the government was dismissed by the Chogyal with the support of the Indian government. The Sikkimese people felt betrayed by the Indian government, which they felt had used them as pawns in its power game with the Chogyal.\n\nWhat had happened was that the Indian government had become uncomfortable with the empowering of the ethnic Nepalese. Just south of Sikkim, around Darjeeling, there was a demand for \u2018Gorkhaland\u2019 among the ethnic Nepalese settled there. India feared that this could lead to a demand for a \u2018Greater Nepal\u2019. For the next two decades, the official Indian policy was to support and empower the Chogyal at the cost of democratic parties.\n\n\u2013 By 1950, momentous changes were taking place around Sikkim. The Chinese had taken over Tibet and Sikkim\u2019s northern border was threatened. The Chogyal signed the Indo-Sikkimese treaty of 1950, which underlined its status as an \u2018Indian Protectorate\u2019.\n\nIn 1959, the Dalai Lama and lakhs of Tibetans left communist-occupied Tibet and arrived in India as refugees. Among them were Crown Prince Thondup\u2019s two sisters, who were married to Tibetan aristocrats. Thondup\u2019s first wife, Crown Princess Sangey Deki, too was Tibetan.\n\nDuring the Indo-China War of 1962, while Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh saw fierce fighting, the Sikkim border was relatively calm. The Chinese had always claimed Sikkim as a part of Tibet and any cross-border action would have called them into question. But tensions with China also meant that Sikkim was strategically important to India like never before.\n\nAn American \u2018Gyalmo\u2019 and a British \u2018Kazini\u2019\n\nIn the 17th century CE, when the first Chogyal had established his kingdom, he had divided Sikkim into 12 units called \u2018Dzongs\u2019, each headed by a \u2018Kazi\u2019, the Sikkimese equivalent of \u2018Jagirs\u2019 and \u2018Jagirdars\u2019. Among the most prominent among them was the old Lepcha family of Khangsarpas, who were the Kazis of Chukang in South Sikkim.\n\nIn 1933, when Crown Prince Thondup had come of age, he was made the head of the prestigious Rumtek monastery. The existing head, who had been set aside for the Prince, was a 29-year-old scion of the Khangsarpa family \u2013 Kazi Lendup Dorjee (1904-2007), who would be famous in history as \u2018LD Kazi\u2019. Kazi would resent this for the rest of his life. The rivalry between Kazi and Thondup was to shape the destiny of Sikkim.\n\nUnlike the Namgyals, the Kazis of Chukang had encouraged Nepali settlers on their estates. As a result, LD Kazi was not just popular among the Lepchas, but even the ethnic Nepalese. Active in state politics, Kazi had established the Sikkim Praja Mandal in 1945, Sikkim State Congress in 1953 and Sikkim National Congress Party in 1962.\n\nWith the support of the ethnic Nepalese, who made up 75 per cent of the population, he was the tallest and most powerful among Sikkim leaders. But Crown Prince Thondup had a visceral hatred for Kazi (which was reciprocated) and made every attempt to keep him out of power.\n\nKazi\u2019s chief ally was his British wife Elisa Marie, the \u2018Kazini of Chukang\u2019. Smart, intelligent and extremely ambitious, she dreamt of a day when she would be the First Lady of Sikkim. Living in Kalimpong, just beyond Sikkim\u2019s borders, she wrote scathing articles against the Chogyal, the Crown Prince, and the Sikkim Durbar. It was her articles that shaped public opinion in India against the Sikkim Durbar.\n\nKazini\u2019s favourite target was the 22-year-old American Hope Cooke, whom Crown Prince Thondup had married in 1963. Thondup\u2019s first wife had died in 1957. Two years later, while staying at the Himalayan Hotel in Darjeeling, Thondup met a 19-year-old American student, Hope Cooke, the scion of a wealthy New York family, who was travelling through the Himalayas on a study trip. Thondup and Hope fell in love, and with Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s approval, got married.\n\nShortly after this marriage, Thondup\u2019s father Sir Tashi Namgyal died and Thondup succeeded to the throne as the \u2018Chogyal of Sikkim\u2019 and Hope became the Gyalmo (Queen). The American Queen brought with her international media attention, because the press was fascinated by her.\n\nMeanwhile, the American Gyalmo soon raised eyebrows in India. A large section of Indians believed that she was a CIA spy or an American \u2018agent\u2019, although this was not true. A number of senior Indian officials such as former Indian intelligence officer GBS Sidhu and Indira Gandhi\u2019s secretary P N Dhar wrote in their books that the Indian government found no links between Hope and the CIA.\n\nBut this was the height of the cold war, when the paranoia over \u2018Videshi Taakat\u2019 (Foreign Power) and \u2018Videshi Haath\u2019 (Foreign Hand) seeking to destabilize India, was being fuelled by Indian politicians and the Indian press. Sadly, the presence of a young American girl served as a lightning rod for these theories.\n\n\u2013 The ambitious new Chogyal Thondup wanted to turn Sikkim into an independent state like Bhutan and he began to press the Indian government for Sikkim\u2019s membership into the United Nations.\n\nChogyal Thondup and Hope Cook also went on an international public relations campaign - of which the fashion show in New York was a part. They hoped that with this, the world would recognize Sikkim as an independent nation.\n\nStrangely, while the Chogyal wined and dined with the Who\u2019s Who on the international stage, he made no attempt to reach out to the majority of Sikkim\u2019s population \u2013 the ethnic Nepalese. Most of them favoured equal rights and a merger with India.\n\nIn 1966, Hope Cook wrote an article in the Bulletin of Tibetology demanding that India give Darjeeling back to Sikkim, and creating an uproar in the Indian Parliament. The following year, the Chogyal set up a committee of Sikkimese Intellectuals called the \u2018Study Forum\u2019, who worked towards creating an independent Sikkim.\n\nMatters finally came to an head on 15th August 1968, India\u2019s Independence Day, when a group of schoolchildren walked through the streets of Gangtok carrying banners - \u2018Indians Get Out Of Sikkim\u2019 read one; \u2018We are a buffer, not a duffer\u2019 read another; \u2018We want Independence\u2019 proclaimed a third. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who had been preoccupied with other matters, finally had to take notice of the matter and the Indian government informed Chogyal in no uncertain terms that a demand for independence would not be tolerated.\n\n\u2018Can you do something about Sikkim?\u2019\n\nSince the merger of Sikkim with India in 1975, there has been a lot of discussion about the alleged involvement of the Indian intelligence agency, the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW), in the events. In 2018, the former head of RAW operations in Sikkim, G B S Sidhu wrote a book titled Sikkim - Dawn of Democracy: The Truth Behind The Merger With India (2018), in which he revealed in great detail the extent of the RAW operations. Sidhu only confirmed what had been suspected for a while.\n\nThe genesis of this operation was a meeting between Indira Gandhi and legendary Indian spymaster and RAW founder, Rameshwar Nath Kao, in September 1972. \u201cCan you do something about Sikkim?\u201d Sidhu reveals, was the question Indira Gandhi had put before Kao. And the spymaster got to work.\n\nCorroborating Sidhu\u2019s account is that of P N Dhar, Indira Gandhi\u2019s Principal Secretary, who in his memoirs Indira Gandhi, The Emergency and Indian Democracy (2000) reveals:\n\n\u201c Under Kao\u2019s overall guidance, the RAW team helped the pro-democracy leaders build up their organisation and make their weight felt in the politics of Sikkim. This process had started several months before the storm broke in April 1973 .\u201d\n\nAnd what a storm it was! The day was meticulously chosen \u2013 4th April 1973, the date of His Majesty Chogyal Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim\u2019s 50th birthday celebrations, as a day of protest by the democratic forces. A year earlier, the Chogyal had appointed himself Prime Minister of Sikkim and concentrated all power in his own hands. The people\u2019s representatives demanded that democratic rule be established in Sikkim.\n\nAs the Sikkim Durbar prepared for grand celebrations, under Kazi\u2019s leadership, thousands of ethnic Nepali men, women and children from across Sikkim poured into Gangtok.\n\nOn the morning of 4th April, Hope Cooke woke up to the sound of gunshots coming from the bazaars. Sikkimese Intelligence Chief Karma Thopden burst breathlessly into the palace to inform the King that a huge crowd of 5,000-6,000 protestors had gathered in the bazaar and the situation in Gangtok was spinning out of control.\n\nStrangely, the Chogyal decided that the Birthday Durbar should go on as planned. As the sound of demonstrators rose from below, the Chogyal sat in his gold robes for the traditional receiving of silk scarves. While the afternoon\u2019s sporting events were cancelled, the birthday dinner was to go ahead as planned. It was truly like Versailles on the eve of the French Revolution.\n\nThings would have subsided the next day, but Crown Prince Tenzing (Thondup\u2019s eldest son) went out for a drive the next day in their Jonga jeep and got into a skirmish with the crowd, firing a few rounds. The panicked Kazi and the democratic leaders sent a desperate message to Indira Gandhi: \u201c Intervene quickly and fully before we are massacred.\u201d\n\nThe Chogyal waited four days before he realized that the situation had spun out of his control. On 8th April 1973, he formally asked the Indian government to take charge. Indian bureaucrat B S Das was sent as the \u2018Chief Administrator\u2019. On 8th May 1973, a tripartite agreement was signed between the Chogyal, Kazi and the Indian government, in which Chogyal continued to be the Head of State, while Kazi became the Prime Minister.\n\nBut even with this agreement, the situation did not improve and skirmishes continued between loyalists of Kazi and the Chogyal. There was even an attempt on Kazi\u2019s life. In the following year, elections took place in Sikkim, and Kazi\u2019s faction won 31 of the 32 seats. Kazini was finally the First Lady of Sikkim. Amid huge protests from the Chogyal\u2019s loyalists, the elected Sikkim government passed the Government of Sikkim Bill (1974), which made Sikkim a part of India.\n\nIn September 1974, the Indian Parliament passed the Thirty-Sixth Amendment, making Sikkim a part of India. The Lok Sabha adopted the bill by 310 votes to seven, and the Rajya Sabha on 7th September by 175 to eight. The Jana Sangh was the only major party to support the move, while the communists and socialists opposed it.\n\nBut problems did not end there. Sikkim had still not \u2018merged\u2019 with India, and the Chogyal was still officially the ruler. Finally, on 14th April 1975, a referendum was held in Sikkim, which voted with 97 per cent of the vote, to abolish the monarchy and merge with India. On 16th May 1975, Sikkim became a part of India.\n\nOn the morning of 11th March 1978, just outside Gangtok, a Mercedes car swerved to avoid an approaching truck and plunged 300 feet down a cliff, into the valley. Its sole occupant, the 26-year-old, Cambridge-educated Crown Prince Tenzing, the eldest son of Chongyal Thondup, was killed instantly. The dynasty, which began with the Curse of the Namgyals, ended with this. The heartbroken Chogyal died in 1982. Hope had already moved to New York with her children, where they live to this day.\n\nLD Kazi went on to become the \u2018Grand Old Man of Sikkim\u2019 and passed away in 2007 at the age of 102. He was awarded the \u2018Sikkim Ratna\u2019 in 2004.\n\nWith Sikkim becoming a part of India, came new opportunities for the Sikkimese people. Today, Sikkim is an inseparable part of India even if the road to getting here was twisted.\n\nThis article is part of our special series the \u2018Making of Modern India\u2019 through which we are focussing on the period between 1900-2000.

It has the smallest number of people and second smallest land size (7,110 square kilometres or 2,750 square miles) of any major divisions in the Republic of India. The third highest mountain in the world, Mt. Kanchenjunga (8,597 metres or 28,205 feet above sea level), is in Sikkim. Its neighbours are Bhutan to the east, Nepal to the west, the Tibet Autonomous Region of P.R.C. to the north and the Indian province of West Bengal to its south. The state capital is Gangtok and other big towns are Gayzing, Pelling, Yuksam and Jorethang. The languages spoken here are Sikkimese, Lepcha, Tibetan, Nepali, Hindi and English. Tourism makes a lot of the money in this small organised state of India, because it is not close to the sea.\n\nSikkim has been cut off from the outside world for a long time. It was settled by Tibetans in the 16th century. It became a British Protectorate in 1890. Sikkim was transferred to India in 1949 by the British. It was annexed in 1975.\n\nThe majority is formed of Bhutias (Tibetan and Bhutnese in origin) and aboriginal Lepchas, who are mainly pastoral nomads. The Sikkimese predominantly practice Hinduism, but the former Chogyal House (\u201cKing under the religious laws\u201d) and the official class are Buddhist. Sikkim is known for its Buddhist monasteries. Tibeto-Burmese languages and dialects are commonly spoken. Sikkim is bordered by the Tibet autonomous region of China to north\n\nPhysical features [ change | change source ]\n\nSikkim is the second smallest state after Goa, but it has many physical features like forests, rivers and mountains around its edges. Most of the mountains are above 6100 metres (20000ft) are near the west of the occupied territory, like Mt Kanchendzonga. Other mountains that are over 6100 meters (20000ft)tall are Kabru (the second tallest), Sinilchu, Pandim, Rothong, Kokthang, Talung, Kanglakhang, Simvo & Jonsang. On the east side the tallest peak is Paunhri, which is about 6700 meters(22000ft) tall. The other mountains that are a little bit shorter than 6100 meters (20000ft) are Masthonangye, Yabukjakchen, Narsing and Lamaonden. Most of the mountains in Sikkim have never been climbed, because the Sikkimese consider them sacred. They feel that when the mountains are climbed, they will not be holy anymore.\n\nSikkim has many hot springs which are known to be good for health. The most important hot-springs are at Phurchachu (Reshi), Yumthang, Borang, Ralang, Taram-chu and Yumey Samdong. All these hotsprings have a lot of sulfur and are near the river banks. The average temperature of the water in these hot springs is 50 \u00b0C.\n\nOn the way between Gangtok to Nathula, 35 kilometres from Gangtok is Lake Changu (Tsomgo), about 3693 meters (12310 ftp) above Sea level.\n\nTwo other lakes nearby are the Bidangcho and the Mememcho. Lake Kechopari is another well-known lake. It is between Gyalshing and Yoksum.\n\nMany of the lakes in Sikkim are on the western border, north of Chiwabhanjang towards the Base Camp. Laxmipokhari, Lampokhari, Majurpokhari, Dud Phokhari, Samiti Lake, and the twin lakes of Ram-Laxman are a few of the lakes in this area.\n\nGurudogmar, which is the largest lake, is in North Sikkim.\n\nSikkimese people usually eat rice, green vegetables, potatoes, dal, and sinky, Kenama and Gundruk.\n\nMomo is a very popular Tibetan treat in Sikkim. It is prepared by stuffing meat and vegetable ingredients in flour dough then making them into dumplings. Momos are eaten with soup and chilli sauce. This dish can be found in almost every local restaurant and fast food shop.\n\nThukpa is a noodle soup with vegetables and beef which is also very popular.\n\nSeal Roti is made by grinding rice and water into a paste, then deep fried. It is normally eaten with potato curry. It is prepared during Dasai and Tihar (local festivals).\n\nGundruk is the leaves of the mustard oil plant that are dried in the sun, then boiled with ingredients.\n\nArea : 7110 km 2\n\nCapital : Gangtok\n\nHeight: 1,780 m (5,840 ft) above sea level\n\nPopulation: 6.10 Lakhs (= 610,000)\n\nLand type: Hilly from 180 m (~600 ft.) to over 8.690 m (28,509 ft) above sea level\n\nClimate: Summer\n\n\n\nMax- 21 \u00b0C ; Min - 13 \u00b0C\n\nWinter\n\n\n\nMax -13 \u00b0C ; Min - 0.48 \u00b0C Rainfall : 325 cm every year\n\nLanguages spoken: Nepali, Bhutia, Lepcha, Tibetan, English, Hindi"}, {"url": "https://www.sikkim.ch/english/history.php", "page_content": "History of Sikkim\n\nSikkim was a Buddhist kingdom under the Namgyal-Chogyal dynasty from 1642 to 1975.\n\nTime and again the little kingdom had to defend itself against attacks from Nepal. 1835 the area of Darjeeling - that had been part of Sikkim until then - was annexed by British India. Sikkim was a protectorate first of British India and after its independence in 1947 of India. With foreign policy and national defense in the hands of India the political influence of Sikkim became more severely restricted when the new Constitution came into force in 1955. Bureaucrats planned to bring the monarchy to an end in 1973 and India in turn, increased its influence. The Chogyal (king who governs with righteousness) Palden Namgyal Thodup was crashed in 1975 and Sikkim merged with India as its 22nd state.\n\nPre-History\n\nThe first known people to occupy Sikkim are the Lepcha. Their cultural traits such as dress and family norms show close affinity with the Khasi of Meghalaya, and linguistically, they have a lot in common with the Tangkul Naga of Northern Manipur. Earliest historical records mention the passage of the Buddhist saint Padmasambhava through Sikkim in the 8th century A.D. Guru Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rimpoche introduced Buddhism and predicted that a century later the era of monarchy would arrive.\n\nAD 1200\u2019s\n\nGuru Tashi, a prince of the Kham district in eastern Tibet had a divine vision to go south and seek his fortune in \u2018Denzong, the valley of rice\u2019. As directed, he heads in the southern direction with is family that includes five sons. During their wanderings, they enter a Sakya kingdom where the construction of a monastery is being held back with the workers\u2019 inability to erect the pillars. The eldest son of Guru Tashi helps in raising the pillars single-handedly and thereon comes to be known as Khye Bumsa, meaning, \u2018the superior of ten thousand\u2019. The Sakya king offers his daughters hand in marriage to Khye Bumsa, and the couple settle in the Chumbi Valley.\n\nAD 1300\u2019s\n\nKhye Bumsa\u2019s wife is barren and the couple are advised to seek help from the Lepcha priest king, Thekong Tek who rules (Sikkim) the area south of the Chumbi. Having received the blessings of Thekong Tek, Bumsa\u2019s wife is able to bear three sons, and out of gratitude he visits the grand old sage several times more nurturing an amicable relationship between them. Ironically, Thekong Tek himself is without an offspring to inherit his kingdom. It is said that he allowed Khye Bumsa to rule after his death following a covenant of blood brotherhood between them at Kabi Lungchok, on a solemn oath that he would not discriminate his newly acquired Lepcha subjects. It is a fact that most among Khye Bumsa\u2019s nobility each took a Lepcha spouse to attest the pledge.\n\nFoundation of the Monarchy\n\nAD 1600\u2019s\n\nEvents of the persecution of the Nyingmapa sect in Tibet lead to their fleeing the country and taking refuge in places like Sikkim and Bhutan. In 1642 Phuntsog Namgyal, a fifth-generation descendant of Khye Bumsa is consecrated as the first Chogyal in Yuksam by Rimpoche Lhatsun Chempo, the founder of the Nyingmapa order in Sikkim and two venerated lamas. Sikkim\u2019s territory then included the Chumbi Valley in the north, up to Ha Dzong in Bhutan, as far as the Arun River in Nepal, and much of the Jalpaiguri District of West Bengal.\n\nPhuntsog Namgyal, a fifth-generation descendant of Khye Bumsa, was consecrated as the first Chogyal (king who governs with righteousness) at Yoksum in 1642 by three venerated lamas. Phuntsog Namgyal was succeeded in 1670 by his son, who moved the capital from Yuksom to Rabdentse.\n\nAD 1700\u2019s\n\nWith the help of the Chogyal\u2019s half-sister who had been denied the throne, Sikkim was invaded by the Bhutanese in 1700. With help from Tibet the Bhutanese were driven back and the throne to the Chogyal was restored ten years later. Sikkim loses Kalimpong and all territories east of it to Bhutan.\n\nBetween 1717 and 1733, the kingdom of Sikkim faced many raids by the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east, culminating with the destruction of the capital Rabdentse by the Nepalese. To support Sikkim and defend Tibet against the Gorkha Kingdom of present day Nepal, China sent troops to support Sikkim. With the subsequent defeat over the Gorkha it was the Chinese Qing Dinasty that established control over Sikkim.\n\nSikkim during the rule of the British in India\n\nAD 1800\u2019s\n\nDuring British rule in neighboring India, Sikkim allied with Britain against their common adversary, Nepal. Reacting to a Nepalese attack that affected much of Sikkim including the plains of the Terai the British East India Company was prompted to attack Nepal, resulting in the Gurkah war of 1814.\n\nTreaties signed between British India and Sikkim resulted in the return of some, but not all occupied territory to Sikkim.\n\nAD 1817\n\nThe intervention by British India following their war with Nepal, and the signing of the Treaty of Titaliya between British India and Sikkim restores some of the Nepalese occupied territory though not all.\n\nAD 1828\n\nBritish Commercial Resident of Malda, J. W. Grant, and Captain Lloyd visit the Darjeeling area in a matter concerning a dispute between Nepal and Sikkim. Quick to notice the position of Darjeeling as a prospective hill resort and an outpost for trade with Tibet, they forward the proposal to their government.\n\nAD 1835\n\nDarjeeling is leased from the Sikkim Raja for a fee of Rs. 3,000 per annum.\n\nTies between Sikkim and the British weakened when the latter began taxation of the Morang region.\n\nAD 1849 \u2013 1865\n\nDarjeeling becomes famous in the Raj as a hill station and a sanatorium. Trade with Tibet develops and tea estates flourish all around its hilly slopes. In Darjeeling the British planted with the help of Nepalese workers the first tea gardens. Equipped with more pleasant climate than Kolkota, the British make Darjeeling a hill station for their administrators.\n\nTwo British physicians, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Dr. Archibald Campbell, the latter being in charge of relations between the British and Sikkimese governments, ventured into the mountains of Sikkim unannounced and unauthorized. The doctors were detained by the Sikkimese government, leading to a punitive British expedition against the kingdom, after which the Darjeeling district and Morang were annexed to British India in 1853. The invasion led to the Chogyal of Sikkim becoming a titular ruler under the directive of the British governor.\n\nIn 1865 Kalimpong is ceded by the British Indian Empire from Bhutan and vies with Sikkim and Darjeeling as a Tibetan trading post.\n\nAD 1889\n\nClaude White becomes the Political Officer in Sikkim with a task to keep a tight rein on the activities of the Sikkim Raja and his ministers. Soon after, a number of intriguing incidents occur. Two heirs apparent to the throne of Sikkim die in mysterious circumstances, leaving the throne in the hands of second-in-line princes, who by royal decree had actually been groomed for monkhood.\n\nAD 1890\n\nSikkim became a British protectorate, and was gradually granted more sovereignty over the next three decades.\n\nAD 1914\n\nOxford educated Sidkeong Tulku, the 10th Chogyal ascends to the throne introducing administrative and political reforms but his rule is short-lived. He dies within a year of enthronement. He is succeeded by his brother, Tashi Namgyal.\n\nAD 1930 - 1949\n\nPilot Officer Crown Prince Paljor Namgyal takes up bomber duty in the Royal Indian Air Force and is killed in action during World War II, while on the home front some disgruntled Sikkimese start a peoples movement to do away with the feudal system and are successful. The king takes refuge in the Political Officer\u2019s residency and asks to be reinstated to his throne. Conceding to certain demands of the P.O., Sir Tashi Namgyal\u2019s throne is restored and the 30-day republic annulled. In 1949, the Indian government installs a Dewan from its side to serve as the state\u2019s chief administrative officer.\n\nPost Indian independence\n\nAD 1947\n\nWhen India became independent in 1947, a popular vote rejected Sikkim's joining the Indian Union, and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, which controlled its external affairs, defense, diplomacy and communications, but Sikkim otherwise retained administrative autonomy.\n\nAD 1953\n\nA state council was established in 1953 to allow for constitutional government under the Chogyal. Meanwhile, the Sikkim National Congress demanded fresh elections and greater representation for Nepalis in Sikkim.\n\nAD 1962\n\nChina attacks India. There is a massive build-up of Indian troops inside Sikkim.\n\nAD 1963\n\nCrown Prince Palden Thondup Namgyal marries American debutante Hope Cooke in a spectacular fairytale-like ceremony covered by Time/Life and National Geographic capturing world attention for a moment.\n\nAD 1973\n\nLhendup Dorji Kazi, a former Sikkim Council member leads a peoples-agitation against the monarchy making demands for a one-man one-vote system. To maintain parity between the Bhutia-Lepcha minority (25%) and the Nepalese majority (75%), a single Bhutia-Lepcha vote was equivalent to six Nepali votes. In 1973, riots in front of the Chogyal\u2019s palace led to a formal request by the Chogyal for protection from India.\n\nMerger with India\n\nAD 1975\n\nIn 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India. In April of that year, the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal's palace guards. Thereafter, a referendum was held in which supposedly a majority of voters supported abolishing the monarchy, effectively approving union with India. However, the legitimacy of this referendum-vote has been widely criticized. Although the union with India was presented as the will of the people by the India authority, the merger was widely criticized as an annexation and India was accused of exploiting the ethnic divide and rigging the referendum. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and the monarchy was abolished. To enable the incorporation of the new state, the Indian Parliament amended the Indian Constitution. First, the 35th Amendment laid down a set of conditions that made Sikkim an \"Associate State,\" a special designation not used by any other state. Later, the 36th Amendment repealed the 35th Amendment, and made Sikkim a full state, adding its name to the First Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nAD 1965\n\nDeath of Sir Tashi Namgyal. Palden and Hope succeed to the throne as Chogyal and Gyalmo.\n\nRecent history\n\nAD 2000\n\nIn 2000, the seventeenth Karmapa, Urgyen Trinley Dorje, who had been confirmed by the Dalai Lama and accepted as a tulku by the Chinese government, escaped from Tibet, seeking to return to the Rumtek Monastery in Sikkim. Chinese officials were in a quandary on this issue, as any protests to India would mean an explicit endorsement of India's governance of Sikkim, which China still recognized as an independent state occupied by India.\n\nAD 2003\n\nThe Chinese government eventually recognized Sikkim as an Indian state in 2003, on the condition that India officially recognize Tibet as a part of China; New Delhi had originally accepted Tibet as a part of China in 1953 during the government of Jawaharlal Nehru. The 2003 agreement led to a thaw in Sino-Indian relations.\n\nAD 2006\n\nOn 6 July 2006, the Sikkimese Himalayan pass of Nathu La was opened to cross-border trade, becoming the first open border between India and China. The pass, which had previously been closed since the 1962 Sino-Indian War, was an offshoot of the ancient Silk Road."}, {"url": "https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/here-s-how-sikkim-became-an-integral-part-of-india-on-this-day-in-1975_-345517.html", "page_content": "One of the most beautiful places across the length and breadth of the country, Sikkim, became a part of India on this day in 1975.\n\nSikkim did not become a part of India when it became an independent Union in 1947.

However, it remained under the protection of India and until 1975 it remained an Indian protectorate but an independent state.\n\neSikkimTourism\n\nHere is the timeline of Sikkim as the state until it officially included in Union of India.\n\n1. Sikkim as a state came into being in 1642 when the rule of Chogyal dynasty and 1890 it came under British rule and became of protectorate state of British. It meant that it came under the jurisdiction of the British and acted as buffer state between China and British India which also included Nepal and Bhutan.\n\n2.

In 1975, the people of Sikkim rebelled against the monarch.

Seeing the law and order cripple, India intervened militarily and restoring the order. The 1967 batch IPS officer Ajit Doval, who is currently National Security Adviser went from Mizoram to Sikkim and handled the entire operation.

This year too, political leaders such as Congress party chief Mallikarjun Kharge, party leader Rahul Gandhi and Home Minister Amit Shah conveyed their messages, marking the day India\u2019s the 22nd state joined the union.\n\nHow did the state join India, around two decades after Sardar Vallabbhai Patel led the task of integration of princely states into India? We explain.\n\nThe kingdom of Sikkim was established in 1642, when, according to one account, three Tibetan lamas consecrated Phuntsong Namgyal as the first ruler or Chogyal of Sikkim. The monarchy of the Namgyal dynasty was maintained for the next 333 years, until its integration with India in 1975.\n\nSikkim\u2019s Chogyal dynasty was of Tibetan origin. Sandwiched between India and China, and often party to conflicts over land with Bhutan and Nepal, the British colonisation of India first led to a kind of formal relationship developing between the two states.\n\nThe British saw Sikkim as a buffer state against China and against Nepal, with whom they fought in the Anglo-Gorkha war of 1814-16, helping Sikkim secure a number of territories that Nepal had previously captured.\n\nA formal protectorate was established over Sikkim through the Treaty of Tumlong in 1861, meaning the British had control over it but it was not officially under their rule and the Chogyals could continue holding onto power.\n\nOther official treaties followed: The treaty of Titaliya in 1817 gave the British authorities a number of commercial and political advantages in Sikkim. The Calcutta Convention of 1890 demarcated the border between Sikkim and Tibet, and was signed by Viceroy Lord Lansdowne and Qing China\u2019s Imperial Associate Resident in Tibet. The Lhasa Convention of 1904 affirmed the Calcutta Convention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndependent India and Sikkim\n\nAfter India\u2019s independence, princely states had the option to accede to India or Pakistan, and certain cases \u2013 like of Hyderabad, Junagadh and Kashmir \u2013 where a decision was not immediate, led to greater confusion. Such was the case with Sikkim, thanks to a unique relationship with British rule.\n\nVenkataraghavan Subha Srinivasan writes in his book, \u2018The Origin of India\u2019s States\u2019, that Sardar Vallabbhai Patel and the constitutional adviser to the constituent assembly, BN Rau, wanted to integrate the state with India by having the then Chogyal Tashi Namgyal sign the Instrument of Accession.\n\nSikkim King Tashi Namgyal. (Express archive photo) Sikkim King Tashi Namgyal. (Express archive photo)\n\nIndia\u2019s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, noted the unique situation in Sikkim. India was, during meetings with representatives between the two, of the view that it should take control of defence, external affairs and communication subjects for Sikkim. Until this was finalised, it was to sign a Standstill Agreement, keeping things as they were for the time being.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, there was at least some demand within Sikkim to develop closer ties with India. Srinivasan\u2019s book says that ethnically, Sikkim consisted of three communities, the Bhutias, Lepchas and Nepalis, of which the Nepalis formed the largest group. Three political parties, the Sikkim State Congress (SSC) led by a Bhutia man, the Praja Mandal (PM) that had Lepcha leadership and Praja Sudharak Samaj (PSS) was led by a Nepali, passed a resolution in December 1947 demanding a popular government, abolition of landlordism and accession to India.\n\nIn Books | A comprehensive account of the history of Sikkim since 1947, that lays to rest any suggestion of the forcible annexation of the state\n\nA delegation of SSC and PM leaders also met Jawaharlal Nehru, who was of the view that India could not intervene at this moment, and that Sikkim should \u201cgrow according to its own genius.\u201d Years later, PN Dhar, who was the Principal Secretary to PM Indira Gandhi, recalled that she said \u201cin very clear terms\u201d that her father had made a mistake in not heeding the wishes of the people of Sikkim to merge with India.\n\nAfter protests in Sikkim, the king appointed an Indian officer as the diwan or chief minister, along with an advisory committee with SSC representatives.\n\nIn 1950, the Indo-Sikkim Treaty was signed, making Sikkim an Indian protectorate. It would not be sovereign, as India controlled its defence, external affairs and strategic communications. It also secured exclusive rights to build infrastructure there and Sikkimese people would travel abroad with Indian passports. \u201cInternal autonomy\u201d was to be available to Sikkim. Additionally, a clause gave India overriding powers in cases of security threats.\n\nHow Sikkim joined India\n\nSikkim\u2019s state council or assembly had some elected members and others nominated by the king. In the early years, it saw some political tussle over the representation for various communities, and the Chogyal\u2019s reluctance to let go of his control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s would see several events change the course of Sikkim\u2019s status.\n\nFirst, a split in the SSC led to the formation of the Sikkim National Congress (SNC) in 1960. The party would go on to play a crucial role in accession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was also change in political leadership on both sides in this decade, with the death of Nehru in 1964 and of his successor, PM Lal Bahadur Shastri, in 1966. Then Chogyal Tashi Namgyal died in 1963, and Maharaj Kumar Thondup succeeded him, planning to leverage this period of changes to seek an independent status for Sikkim.\n\nFor new Indian PM Indira Gandhi, her position weakened after the 1967 general elections that saw her return to power with a reduced majority in the Lok Sabha. This was following the India-China war of 1962, where India lost. It made it all the more important to contain skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops on the Sikkim border. The two states decided to alter existing wording to indicate a \u201cpermanent relationship\u201d between them, but the Chogyal wanted further clarity on Sikkim\u2019s independence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was slowly becoming unacceptable to the Indian leadership, which by the early 1970s, decided to back pro-democracy forces in Sikkim \u2013 such as Kazi Dorji of the SNC.\n\nSikkim Chief Minister Kazi Lhendup Dorji with Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi in 1974. (Express archive photo) Sikkim Chief Minister Kazi Lhendup Dorji with Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi in 1974. (Express archive photo)\n\nFormer R&AW officer Sidhu noted in his book \u2018Sikkim: Dawn of Democracy\u2019 that an Indian delegation went to Gangtok in 1973 as head of a small R&AW team, to inform the Chogyal of Chinese activities. But his real charter was to liaise with the Sikkim Congress, provide them with assistance and advice in the final, by then, aim of Sikkim\u2019s merger with India.\n\nFormer Indian Ambassador to Nepal, Deb Mukharji, notes that Sidhu recounted \u201cin detail his efforts to unify the pro-democracy and pro-merger political forces in Sikkim, which also happened to represent the majority.\u201d\n\nAnti-monarchy protests grew in Sikkim in 1973, following which the royal palace was surrounded by thousands of protesters. Indian troops arrived after the monarch was left with no choice but to ask New Delhi to send assistance. Finally, a tripartite agreement was signed in the same year between the chogyal, the Indian government, and three major political parties, so that major political reforms could be introduced.\n\nA year later, in 1974, elections were held, where the Sikkim Congress led by Kazi Dorji won. That year, a new constitution was adopted, which restricted the role of the monarch to a titular post. A referendum was held in Sikkim in 1975, where two-thirds of eligible voters took part. Here, 59,637 votes were cast in favour of abolishing the monarchy and joining India, with 1,496 voting against.\n\nWithin a week, India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs introduced the Constitution (Thirty-Sixth Amendment) Bill in the Lok Sabha to recognise Sikkim as a state in the Union of India. This was passed in the Parliament and assented to by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, coming into effect on May 16, 1975.\n\nSikkim\u2019s new parliament, led by Dorji, proposed a bill for Sikkim to become an Indian state, which was accepted by the Indian government."}, {"url": "https://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/india/sikkim.html", "page_content": "This page is part of World History at KMLA\n\nFirst posted on May 24th 2002, last revised on September 15th 2008\n\n\n\nClick here to go Home\n\nClick here to go to Information about KMLA, WHKMLA, the author and webmaster\n\nClick here to go to Statistics\n\n"}], "The monarchy in Sikkim was abolished.": [{"url": "https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/13/09/very-short-history-sikkim", "page_content": "Nestled in the mountains between India and Tibet, Sikkim's culture has long been a mixture of traditional animist beliefs, Buddhism \u2014 which became the dominant religion in the eighth century \u2014 and Hindu influences from neighboring Bengal and Nepal.\n\nLong an independent monarchy, in the 19th century Sikkim ceded present-day Darjeeling to the British.

Refugees poured into Sikkim after China's 1959 crackdown in Tibet, and India established an increased military presence along the border near Lhasa.

On 11th November 1971, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of fashionable New York society trooped in, to attend a very special fashion show and dinner in honour of \u2018Their Majesties, the King and Queen of Sikkim\u2019. Outside, the Sikkimese flag flew on both sides of Fifth Avenue. The New York Times reported:\n\n\u201cAs the formally clad guests arrived, they were handed white chiffon scarves to unfold, place over their own two outstretched hands and then hand over (while bowing, of course) to the monarchs who then handed them back again. The king explained the ceremony. \u2018The white scarf signifies purity,\u2019 he said, \u2018so when you give the scarves, you come with a pure heart\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe guests sipped champagne while Sikkimese music played in the background. Over the next two days, similar galas were held at the Colony Club and Waldorf Astoria in New York. The NYT gushed: \u201c She's [The Queen] using fashion to bring her country attention.\u201d\n\nIronically, King Palden Thondup Namgyal (1923-1982) and his American Queen, Hope Cooke, did not need fashion to draw attention to their kingdom, for, as Sikkimese gowns glided through New York ballrooms, Sikkim was at the epicentre of what many believed would be the start of a \u201cThird World War\u201d.\n\nGeneral Yahya Khan of Pakistan had launched a genocide in East Pakistan and millions of East Bengali refugees had flooded India. Both China and the United States, allies of Pakistan, made threatening moves, with China even moving some troops to the Chumbi Valley, just north of Sikkim. less than a month later, in December 1971, the Bangladesh Liberation War would begin.\n\n\u2018Himalayan Marie Antoinette\u2019 , the headlines of the news journal Himalayan Observer screamed, referring to Sikkim\u2019s Queen. The comparison with the deposed French monarch on the eve of the French Revolution was perhaps apt, for within four years, the monarchy would be abolished in Sikkim and the kingdom would merge with India.\n\nThe backstory of Sikkim\u2019s accession to India on 16th May 1975, involving ancient curses, tribal rivalries, foreign consorts, spy agencies and Indian backroom politics, makes it as riveting as a fictional novel. Strangely, few in India are aware of it.\n\nThe Curse of the Namgyals\n\nSikkim\u2019s last ruler, Palden Thondup Namgyal, would not have become King had it not been for an accident at the western end of the Himalayan range. On 20th December 1941, his elder brother, Crown Prince Paljor, a Royal Air Force pilot, was killed in a plane crash in Peshawar. Many in Sikkim believed it was the result of an ancient \u2018curse\u2019 on the Namgyal family, according to which the firstborn rarely succeeded to the throne.\n\nThe \u2018curse\u2019 as well as the events leading to Sikkim\u2019s merger with India, trace their origins to the bitter rivalry between Sikkim\u2019s three main communities \u2013 the Lepchas, the Bhutias and the ethnic Nepalis.\n\nFar back in antiquity, the mountainous region of Sikkim was inhabited by the Lepcha tribe. Then, in the 17th century CE, immigrants from Tibet known as the \u2018Bhutias\u2019 settled in the region. The Buddhist lamas wanted to convert the region into a Buddhist kingdom, and as a result in 1642 CE, Phutsong Namgyal was appointed as the first King or \u2018Chogyal\u2019 of Sikkim. A few years later, the Lepchas and Bhutias sealed a pact at a place called \u2018Krabi Lungstock\u2019, where they agreed to coexist in peace. The Lepchas claimed that the Namgyals had promised in the agreement that they would renounce Buddhism and worship the Animist Lepcha gods. Their failure to do so had cursed the family.\n\nFor centuries, the Buddhist Namgyal kingdom accepted the religious jurisdiction of Tibet, very similar to the authority of the Vatican over Roman Catholic churches in different countries. The Sikkimese court also had very close matrimonial and cultural ties with Tibetan aristocrats. These medieval links were the genesis of China\u2019s claim over Sikkim as an extension of Tibet.\n\nThe traditional Tibetan name for the region was \u2018Denjong\u2019 or the \u2018Valley of Rice\u2019. The name \u2018Sikkim\u2019 is derived from \u2018Su Khyim\u2019 or the \u2018New Palace\u2019 of the Namgyals in the language of the Limbu tribe. Over time, the entire kingdom became known as Sikkim. The Sikkimese had two very powerful and expansionist neighbour\u2019s \u2013 Bhutan to the east and Nepal to its west. This explains the peculiar, elongated shape of the kingdom\u2019s territories.\n\nIn the 19th century, Sikkim had to deal with a new power, the British East India Company, which had established its rule in India. The British were interested in Sikkim because of its strategic importance, because through the region lay the easiest route to the heart of Tibet. An opportunity arose during the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16, when the Sikkimese approached the British for help against the Nepalese. In exchange, the British and the Sikkimese signed the Treaty of Titalia in 1817, which made the transit of British goods duty-free in Sikkim.\n\nIn 1835, the British secured the cession of Darjeeling from Sikkim as a \u2018sanitorium\u2019 for British officers. Following further disturbances in 1861, the British seized southern Sikkim, comprising the Morung and Terai regions, and made Sikkim a \u2018British Protectorate\u2019. It is this Treaty of Tumlong (1861) that would govern relations between Sikkim and India till 1975.\n\nDisturbance in the Himalayas\n\nIn 1947, when India\u2019s Princely States were asked to merge with either India or Pakistan, the two Himalayan kingdoms of Sikkim and Bhutan remained exceptions. Although they were slightly different from the others, Sikkim was considered an Indian Princely State with membership of the \u2018Chamber of Princes\u2019. Bhutan, on the other hand, was a \u2018Protectorate\u2019. But unlike other rulers, Sir Tashi Namgyal , Thondup\u2019s father, was never asked to sign the merger agreement.\n\n\u2013 In early 1947, Nehru pushed through a resolution in the Indian Constituent Assembly, agreeing that Sikkim and Bhutan were \u201cnot Indian States\u201d and acknowledging that, since they constituted a \u201cspecial problem\u201d, their future should be negotiated separately.\n\nIronically, the Namgyals\u2019 bid for separation suffered from the same obstacle as the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Maharaja of Kashmir \u2013 the support of the majority of the population. According to the 1941 Census, Sikkim\u2019s population comprised 15,000 Lepchas, 17,000 Bhutias and 1,05,000 ethnic Nepalese. While the Bhutia-Lepcha aristocracy dominated the administration and land ownership, the ethnic Nepalese, who were almost 75-77 per cent of the population, had little or no rights.\n\nThese ethnic Nepalese (not just Gorkhas and belonging to different tribes from Nepal) had been settled here as a part of a British policy from the 1860s onwards, to protect and ring-fence Sikkim against a potential Tibetan invasion. Over time, mass migration and settlement turned them into a majority.\n\nThe majority of the ethnic Nepalese were poor peasants and labourers toiling under the Lepcha-Bhutia zamindars. Sikkim was ruled by the Chogyal with the help of his councillors. In December 1947, Tashi Tshering, a former clerk in the Political Office, launched an agitation for democratic rule. The main demands of this movement were the abolition of the Zamindari, establishment of democratic rule and the merger with India.\n\nFor the next two years, the agitation continued and the situation began to deteriorate in Sikkim. Finally, buckling under pressure, a democratic government was set up on 9th May 1948, with Tashi Tshering being appointed Chief Minister. But after just 28 days, the government was dismissed by the Chogyal with the support of the Indian government. The Sikkimese people felt betrayed by the Indian government, which they felt had used them as pawns in its power game with the Chogyal.\n\nWhat had happened was that the Indian government had become uncomfortable with the empowering of the ethnic Nepalese. Just south of Sikkim, around Darjeeling, there was a demand for \u2018Gorkhaland\u2019 among the ethnic Nepalese settled there. India feared that this could lead to a demand for a \u2018Greater Nepal\u2019. For the next two decades, the official Indian policy was to support and empower the Chogyal at the cost of democratic parties.\n\n\u2013 By 1950, momentous changes were taking place around Sikkim. The Chinese had taken over Tibet and Sikkim\u2019s northern border was threatened. The Chogyal signed the Indo-Sikkimese treaty of 1950, which underlined its status as an \u2018Indian Protectorate\u2019.\n\nIn 1959, the Dalai Lama and lakhs of Tibetans left communist-occupied Tibet and arrived in India as refugees. Among them were Crown Prince Thondup\u2019s two sisters, who were married to Tibetan aristocrats. Thondup\u2019s first wife, Crown Princess Sangey Deki, too was Tibetan.\n\nDuring the Indo-China War of 1962, while Arunachal Pradesh and Ladakh saw fierce fighting, the Sikkim border was relatively calm. The Chinese had always claimed Sikkim as a part of Tibet and any cross-border action would have called them into question. But tensions with China also meant that Sikkim was strategically important to India like never before.\n\nAn American \u2018Gyalmo\u2019 and a British \u2018Kazini\u2019\n\nIn the 17th century CE, when the first Chogyal had established his kingdom, he had divided Sikkim into 12 units called \u2018Dzongs\u2019, each headed by a \u2018Kazi\u2019, the Sikkimese equivalent of \u2018Jagirs\u2019 and \u2018Jagirdars\u2019. Among the most prominent among them was the old Lepcha family of Khangsarpas, who were the Kazis of Chukang in South Sikkim.\n\nIn 1933, when Crown Prince Thondup had come of age, he was made the head of the prestigious Rumtek monastery. The existing head, who had been set aside for the Prince, was a 29-year-old scion of the Khangsarpa family \u2013 Kazi Lendup Dorjee (1904-2007), who would be famous in history as \u2018LD Kazi\u2019. Kazi would resent this for the rest of his life. The rivalry between Kazi and Thondup was to shape the destiny of Sikkim.\n\nUnlike the Namgyals, the Kazis of Chukang had encouraged Nepali settlers on their estates. As a result, LD Kazi was not just popular among the Lepchas, but even the ethnic Nepalese. Active in state politics, Kazi had established the Sikkim Praja Mandal in 1945, Sikkim State Congress in 1953 and Sikkim National Congress Party in 1962.\n\nWith the support of the ethnic Nepalese, who made up 75 per cent of the population, he was the tallest and most powerful among Sikkim leaders. But Crown Prince Thondup had a visceral hatred for Kazi (which was reciprocated) and made every attempt to keep him out of power.\n\nKazi\u2019s chief ally was his British wife Elisa Marie, the \u2018Kazini of Chukang\u2019. Smart, intelligent and extremely ambitious, she dreamt of a day when she would be the First Lady of Sikkim. Living in Kalimpong, just beyond Sikkim\u2019s borders, she wrote scathing articles against the Chogyal, the Crown Prince, and the Sikkim Durbar. It was her articles that shaped public opinion in India against the Sikkim Durbar.\n\nKazini\u2019s favourite target was the 22-year-old American Hope Cooke, whom Crown Prince Thondup had married in 1963. Thondup\u2019s first wife had died in 1957. Two years later, while staying at the Himalayan Hotel in Darjeeling, Thondup met a 19-year-old American student, Hope Cooke, the scion of a wealthy New York family, who was travelling through the Himalayas on a study trip. Thondup and Hope fell in love, and with Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s approval, got married.\n\nShortly after this marriage, Thondup\u2019s father Sir Tashi Namgyal died and Thondup succeeded to the throne as the \u2018Chogyal of Sikkim\u2019 and Hope became the Gyalmo (Queen). The American Queen brought with her international media attention, because the press was fascinated by her.\n\nMeanwhile, the American Gyalmo soon raised eyebrows in India. A large section of Indians believed that she was a CIA spy or an American \u2018agent\u2019, although this was not true. A number of senior Indian officials such as former Indian intelligence officer GBS Sidhu and Indira Gandhi\u2019s secretary P N Dhar wrote in their books that the Indian government found no links between Hope and the CIA.\n\nBut this was the height of the cold war, when the paranoia over \u2018Videshi Taakat\u2019 (Foreign Power) and \u2018Videshi Haath\u2019 (Foreign Hand) seeking to destabilize India, was being fuelled by Indian politicians and the Indian press. Sadly, the presence of a young American girl served as a lightning rod for these theories.\n\n\u2013 The ambitious new Chogyal Thondup wanted to turn Sikkim into an independent state like Bhutan and he began to press the Indian government for Sikkim\u2019s membership into the United Nations.\n\nChogyal Thondup and Hope Cook also went on an international public relations campaign - of which the fashion show in New York was a part. They hoped that with this, the world would recognize Sikkim as an independent nation.\n\nStrangely, while the Chogyal wined and dined with the Who\u2019s Who on the international stage, he made no attempt to reach out to the majority of Sikkim\u2019s population \u2013 the ethnic Nepalese. Most of them favoured equal rights and a merger with India.\n\nIn 1966, Hope Cook wrote an article in the Bulletin of Tibetology demanding that India give Darjeeling back to Sikkim, and creating an uproar in the Indian Parliament. The following year, the Chogyal set up a committee of Sikkimese Intellectuals called the \u2018Study Forum\u2019, who worked towards creating an independent Sikkim.\n\nMatters finally came to an head on 15th August 1968, India\u2019s Independence Day, when a group of schoolchildren walked through the streets of Gangtok carrying banners - \u2018Indians Get Out Of Sikkim\u2019 read one; \u2018We are a buffer, not a duffer\u2019 read another; \u2018We want Independence\u2019 proclaimed a third. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who had been preoccupied with other matters, finally had to take notice of the matter and the Indian government informed Chogyal in no uncertain terms that a demand for independence would not be tolerated.\n\n\u2018Can you do something about Sikkim?\u2019\n\nSince the merger of Sikkim with India in 1975, there has been a lot of discussion about the alleged involvement of the Indian intelligence agency, the Research & Analysis Wing (RAW), in the events. In 2018, the former head of RAW operations in Sikkim, G B S Sidhu wrote a book titled Sikkim - Dawn of Democracy: The Truth Behind The Merger With India (2018), in which he revealed in great detail the extent of the RAW operations. Sidhu only confirmed what had been suspected for a while.\n\nThe genesis of this operation was a meeting between Indira Gandhi and legendary Indian spymaster and RAW founder, Rameshwar Nath Kao, in September 1972. \u201cCan you do something about Sikkim?\u201d Sidhu reveals, was the question Indira Gandhi had put before Kao. And the spymaster got to work.\n\nCorroborating Sidhu\u2019s account is that of P N Dhar, Indira Gandhi\u2019s Principal Secretary, who in his memoirs Indira Gandhi, The Emergency and Indian Democracy (2000) reveals:\n\n\u201c Under Kao\u2019s overall guidance, the RAW team helped the pro-democracy leaders build up their organisation and make their weight felt in the politics of Sikkim. This process had started several months before the storm broke in April 1973 .\u201d\n\nAnd what a storm it was! The day was meticulously chosen \u2013 4th April 1973, the date of His Majesty Chogyal Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim\u2019s 50th birthday celebrations, as a day of protest by the democratic forces. A year earlier, the Chogyal had appointed himself Prime Minister of Sikkim and concentrated all power in his own hands. The people\u2019s representatives demanded that democratic rule be established in Sikkim.\n\nAs the Sikkim Durbar prepared for grand celebrations, under Kazi\u2019s leadership, thousands of ethnic Nepali men, women and children from across Sikkim poured into Gangtok.\n\nOn the morning of 4th April, Hope Cooke woke up to the sound of gunshots coming from the bazaars. Sikkimese Intelligence Chief Karma Thopden burst breathlessly into the palace to inform the King that a huge crowd of 5,000-6,000 protestors had gathered in the bazaar and the situation in Gangtok was spinning out of control.\n\nStrangely, the Chogyal decided that the Birthday Durbar should go on as planned. As the sound of demonstrators rose from below, the Chogyal sat in his gold robes for the traditional receiving of silk scarves. While the afternoon\u2019s sporting events were cancelled, the birthday dinner was to go ahead as planned. It was truly like Versailles on the eve of the French Revolution.\n\nThings would have subsided the next day, but Crown Prince Tenzing (Thondup\u2019s eldest son) went out for a drive the next day in their Jonga jeep and got into a skirmish with the crowd, firing a few rounds. The panicked Kazi and the democratic leaders sent a desperate message to Indira Gandhi: \u201c Intervene quickly and fully before we are massacred.\u201d\n\nThe Chogyal waited four days before he realized that the situation had spun out of his control. On 8th April 1973, he formally asked the Indian government to take charge. Indian bureaucrat B S Das was sent as the \u2018Chief Administrator\u2019. On 8th May 1973, a tripartite agreement was signed between the Chogyal, Kazi and the Indian government, in which Chogyal continued to be the Head of State, while Kazi became the Prime Minister.\n\nBut even with this agreement, the situation did not improve and skirmishes continued between loyalists of Kazi and the Chogyal. There was even an attempt on Kazi\u2019s life. In the following year, elections took place in Sikkim, and Kazi\u2019s faction won 31 of the 32 seats. Kazini was finally the First Lady of Sikkim. Amid huge protests from the Chogyal\u2019s loyalists, the elected Sikkim government passed the Government of Sikkim Bill (1974), which made Sikkim a part of India.\n\nIn September 1974, the Indian Parliament passed the Thirty-Sixth Amendment, making Sikkim a part of India. The Lok Sabha adopted the bill by 310 votes to seven, and the Rajya Sabha on 7th September by 175 to eight. The Jana Sangh was the only major party to support the move, while the communists and socialists opposed it.\n\nBut problems did not end there. Sikkim had still not \u2018merged\u2019 with India, and the Chogyal was still officially the ruler. Finally, on 14th April 1975, a referendum was held in Sikkim, which voted with 97 per cent of the vote, to abolish the monarchy and merge with India. On 16th May 1975, Sikkim became a part of India.\n\nOn the morning of 11th March 1978, just outside Gangtok, a Mercedes car swerved to avoid an approaching truck and plunged 300 feet down a cliff, into the valley. Its sole occupant, the 26-year-old, Cambridge-educated Crown Prince Tenzing, the eldest son of Chongyal Thondup, was killed instantly. The dynasty, which began with the Curse of the Namgyals, ended with this. The heartbroken Chogyal died in 1982. Hope had already moved to New York with her children, where they live to this day.\n\nLD Kazi went on to become the \u2018Grand Old Man of Sikkim\u2019 and passed away in 2007 at the age of 102. He was awarded the \u2018Sikkim Ratna\u2019 in 2004.\n\nWith Sikkim becoming a part of India, came new opportunities for the Sikkimese people. Today, Sikkim is an inseparable part of India even if the road to getting here was twisted.\n\nThis article is part of our special series the \u2018Making of Modern India\u2019 through which we are focussing on the period between 1900-2000.

Sikkim was a protectorate first of British India and after its independence in 1947 of India. With foreign policy and national defense in the hands of India the political influence of Sikkim became more severely restricted when the new Constitution came into force in 1955. Bureaucrats planned to bring the monarchy to an end in 1973 and India in turn, increased its influence. The Chogyal (king who governs with righteousness) Palden Namgyal Thodup was crashed in 1975 and Sikkim merged with India as its 22nd state.\n\nPre-History\n\nThe first known people to occupy Sikkim are the Lepcha. Their cultural traits such as dress and family norms show close affinity with the Khasi of Meghalaya, and linguistically, they have a lot in common with the Tangkul Naga of Northern Manipur. Earliest historical records mention the passage of the Buddhist saint Padmasambhava through Sikkim in the 8th century A.D. Guru Padmasambhava, also known as Guru Rimpoche introduced Buddhism and predicted that a century later the era of monarchy would arrive.\n\nAD 1200\u2019s\n\nGuru Tashi, a prince of the Kham district in eastern Tibet had a divine vision to go south and seek his fortune in \u2018Denzong, the valley of rice\u2019. As directed, he heads in the southern direction with is family that includes five sons. During their wanderings, they enter a Sakya kingdom where the construction of a monastery is being held back with the workers\u2019 inability to erect the pillars. The eldest son of Guru Tashi helps in raising the pillars single-handedly and thereon comes to be known as Khye Bumsa, meaning, \u2018the superior of ten thousand\u2019. The Sakya king offers his daughters hand in marriage to Khye Bumsa, and the couple settle in the Chumbi Valley.\n\nAD 1300\u2019s\n\nKhye Bumsa\u2019s wife is barren and the couple are advised to seek help from the Lepcha priest king, Thekong Tek who rules (Sikkim) the area south of the Chumbi. Having received the blessings of Thekong Tek, Bumsa\u2019s wife is able to bear three sons, and out of gratitude he visits the grand old sage several times more nurturing an amicable relationship between them. Ironically, Thekong Tek himself is without an offspring to inherit his kingdom. It is said that he allowed Khye Bumsa to rule after his death following a covenant of blood brotherhood between them at Kabi Lungchok, on a solemn oath that he would not discriminate his newly acquired Lepcha subjects. It is a fact that most among Khye Bumsa\u2019s nobility each took a Lepcha spouse to attest the pledge.\n\nFoundation of the Monarchy\n\nAD 1600\u2019s\n\nEvents of the persecution of the Nyingmapa sect in Tibet lead to their fleeing the country and taking refuge in places like Sikkim and Bhutan. In 1642 Phuntsog Namgyal, a fifth-generation descendant of Khye Bumsa is consecrated as the first Chogyal in Yuksam by Rimpoche Lhatsun Chempo, the founder of the Nyingmapa order in Sikkim and two venerated lamas. Sikkim\u2019s territory then included the Chumbi Valley in the north, up to Ha Dzong in Bhutan, as far as the Arun River in Nepal, and much of the Jalpaiguri District of West Bengal.\n\nPhuntsog Namgyal, a fifth-generation descendant of Khye Bumsa, was consecrated as the first Chogyal (king who governs with righteousness) at Yoksum in 1642 by three venerated lamas. Phuntsog Namgyal was succeeded in 1670 by his son, who moved the capital from Yuksom to Rabdentse.\n\nAD 1700\u2019s\n\nWith the help of the Chogyal\u2019s half-sister who had been denied the throne, Sikkim was invaded by the Bhutanese in 1700. With help from Tibet the Bhutanese were driven back and the throne to the Chogyal was restored ten years later. Sikkim loses Kalimpong and all territories east of it to Bhutan.\n\nBetween 1717 and 1733, the kingdom of Sikkim faced many raids by the Nepalese in the west and Bhutanese in the east, culminating with the destruction of the capital Rabdentse by the Nepalese. To support Sikkim and defend Tibet against the Gorkha Kingdom of present day Nepal, China sent troops to support Sikkim. With the subsequent defeat over the Gorkha it was the Chinese Qing Dinasty that established control over Sikkim.\n\nSikkim during the rule of the British in India\n\nAD 1800\u2019s\n\nDuring British rule in neighboring India, Sikkim allied with Britain against their common adversary, Nepal. Reacting to a Nepalese attack that affected much of Sikkim including the plains of the Terai the British East India Company was prompted to attack Nepal, resulting in the Gurkah war of 1814.\n\nTreaties signed between British India and Sikkim resulted in the return of some, but not all occupied territory to Sikkim.\n\nAD 1817\n\nThe intervention by British India following their war with Nepal, and the signing of the Treaty of Titaliya between British India and Sikkim restores some of the Nepalese occupied territory though not all.\n\nAD 1828\n\nBritish Commercial Resident of Malda, J. W. Grant, and Captain Lloyd visit the Darjeeling area in a matter concerning a dispute between Nepal and Sikkim. Quick to notice the position of Darjeeling as a prospective hill resort and an outpost for trade with Tibet, they forward the proposal to their government.\n\nAD 1835\n\nDarjeeling is leased from the Sikkim Raja for a fee of Rs. 3,000 per annum.\n\nTies between Sikkim and the British weakened when the latter began taxation of the Morang region.\n\nAD 1849 \u2013 1865\n\nDarjeeling becomes famous in the Raj as a hill station and a sanatorium. Trade with Tibet develops and tea estates flourish all around its hilly slopes. In Darjeeling the British planted with the help of Nepalese workers the first tea gardens. Equipped with more pleasant climate than Kolkota, the British make Darjeeling a hill station for their administrators.\n\nTwo British physicians, Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Dr. Archibald Campbell, the latter being in charge of relations between the British and Sikkimese governments, ventured into the mountains of Sikkim unannounced and unauthorized. The doctors were detained by the Sikkimese government, leading to a punitive British expedition against the kingdom, after which the Darjeeling district and Morang were annexed to British India in 1853. The invasion led to the Chogyal of Sikkim becoming a titular ruler under the directive of the British governor.\n\nIn 1865 Kalimpong is ceded by the British Indian Empire from Bhutan and vies with Sikkim and Darjeeling as a Tibetan trading post.\n\nAD 1889\n\nClaude White becomes the Political Officer in Sikkim with a task to keep a tight rein on the activities of the Sikkim Raja and his ministers. Soon after, a number of intriguing incidents occur.

Conceding to certain demands of the P.O., Sir Tashi Namgyal\u2019s throne is restored and the 30-day republic annulled. In 1949, the Indian government installs a Dewan from its side to serve as the state\u2019s chief administrative officer.\n\nPost Indian independence\n\nAD 1947\n\nWhen India became independent in 1947, a popular vote rejected Sikkim's joining the Indian Union, and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim came under the suzerainty of India, which controlled its external affairs, defense, diplomacy and communications, but Sikkim otherwise retained administrative autonomy.\n\nAD 1953\n\nA state council was established in 1953 to allow for constitutional government under the Chogyal. Meanwhile, the Sikkim National Congress demanded fresh elections and greater representation for Nepalis in Sikkim.\n\nAD 1962\n\nChina attacks India.

In 1973, riots in front of the Chogyal\u2019s palace led to a formal request by the Chogyal for protection from India.\n\nMerger with India\n\nAD 1975\n\nIn 1975, the Prime Minister of Sikkim appealed to the Indian Parliament for Sikkim to become a state of India. In April of that year, the Indian Army took over the city of Gangtok and disarmed the Chogyal's palace guards. Thereafter, a referendum was held in which supposedly a majority of voters supported abolishing the monarchy, effectively approving union with India. However, the legitimacy of this referendum-vote has been widely criticized. Although the union with India was presented as the will of the people by the India authority, the merger was widely criticized as an annexation and India was accused of exploiting the ethnic divide and rigging the referendum. On 16 May 1975, Sikkim became the 22nd state of the Indian Union, and the monarchy was abolished. To enable the incorporation of the new state, the Indian Parliament amended the Indian Constitution. First, the 35th Amendment laid down a set of conditions that made Sikkim an \"Associate State,\" a special designation not used by any other state. Later, the 36th Amendment repealed the 35th Amendment, and made Sikkim a full state, adding its name to the First Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nAD 1965\n\nDeath of Sir Tashi Namgyal.

Chinese officials were in a quandary on this issue, as any protests to India would mean an explicit endorsement of India's governance of Sikkim, which China still recognized as an independent state occupied by India.\n\nAD 2003\n\nThe Chinese government eventually recognized Sikkim as an Indian state in 2003, on the condition that India officially recognize Tibet as a part of China; New Delhi had originally accepted Tibet as a part of China in 1953 during the government of Jawaharlal Nehru. The 2003 agreement led to a thaw in Sino-Indian relations.\n\nAD 2006\n\nOn 6 July 2006, the Sikkimese Himalayan pass of Nathu La was opened to cross-border trade, becoming the first open border between India and China. The pass, which had previously been closed since the 1962 Sino-Indian War, was an offshoot of the ancient Silk Road."}, {"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/monarchy-to-long-term-cm-to-instability-how-did-sikkim-get-here-pawan-chamling-5915722/", "page_content": "Last week, Sikkim\u2019s longest serving Chief Minister, Pawan Chamling, became the sole elected Opposition representative in the Assembly after the remaining 12 Sikkim Democratic Front (SDF) MLAs defected, with 10 joining the BJP and another two joining the ruling Sikkim Krantikari Morcha (SKM). Political instability is new to this relatively young state, where Chamling served as Chief Minister for 25 years starting 1994. It began when the SKM voted out the SDF with a slim margin time in April this year.\n\nWhat happened in the Assembly elections?\n\nIt was actually the 2014 elections that had heralded the arrival of the SKM, formed the previous year by Chamling\u2019s former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 P S Tamang, also known as P S Golay. The SKM won 10 of the 32 Assembly seats with 40.8 per cent of the vote, while the SDF held on with 22 seats and 55 per cent.\n\nThis year, the SKM edged out the SDF by 17 seats to 15 but was marginally behind in vote shares, at 47.03 per cent to the SDF\u2019s 47.63 per cent. In terms of actual members, the SDF had 13 because two of them had won from two seats each.\n\nIt was the first time in the state that a government has been voted out. Sikkim has had a change in government twice earlier, but the incumbent government had already fallen before the new one was voted in. Some analysts look at the current situation as the birth of Sikkim as a true democracy. A kingdom until recently, Sikkim was seen as continuing with a \u201cmonarchic psychology\u201d as long as Chamling was in the chair.\n\nWhy has there been political instability after the elections?\n\nBehind in vote shares, the SKM won narrowly in most seats, while the SDF\u2019s margins were generally much wider. As such, the SKM government has looked tentative. The SKM will look to consolidate in upcoming byelections to three seats, two of these held by the SDF and one by the SKM itself.\n\nGolay himself is in a precarious position. He did not contest the elections, having been convicted of corruption by a Sikkim court based on charges brought by the previous SDF government. He has approached the Supreme Court to overturn the conviction, as well as the Election Commission to allow him to contest the bypolls. He served a year in jail and was released in August 2018.\n\nHow is the BJP placed?\n\nOn the face of it, the BJP\u2019s gains do not directly strengthen the SKM but appear to have weakened the SDF\u2019s hopes of toppling the government. The 10 defections, however, signal the BJP\u2019s arrival in the state where it had won only 0.7 per cent of the vote share in 2014 and 1.6 per cent in 2019, after having contested 13 seats on both occasions. Both the SDF and the SKM are part of the NEDA nationally but contest separately from the BJP in the state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a state dominated by regional parties, the defection of 10 SDF MLAs has suddenly made BJP the main opposition. SDF leaders claim that the MLAs have switched parties for fear of persecution from the SKM. Sources said SDF leaders maintain cordial relations with the BJP, despite the defections.\n\nHow did the SKM gain ground?\n\nDuring the SDF regime, Sikkim had done well on many social and economic indicators. According to state government data, its per capita income is Rs 2,33,311 as opposed to the national average of Rs 86,660; its life expectancy is 73.15 compared to the national average of 68.6; and its literacy rate for both men and women is above 90 per cent as compared to the national average of 74 per cent and 65 per cent respectively. According to NITI Aayog data, Sikkim\u2019s infant mortality rate is 16 per 1,000 live births (2016) compared to the national IMR of 34. Sikkim was also the first state to be declared open-defecation free.\n\nThe SKM campaigned by questioning these achievements and highlighting reports of corruption within the SDF government. Unemployment is seen as a major driver for change, especially with 60 per cent of voters being under the age of 40, and 16 per cent being first-time voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat was Sikkim\u2019s history before this new phase of political instability?\n\nAccording to the Anglo-Chinese Convention of 1890, representatives of the British Crown and the Emperor of China mutually agreed that Sikkim would remain a protectorate of the British Government. Sikkim itself was not consulted for the agreement.\n\nUnder the Indo-Sikkim Treaty of 1950, Sikkim was to become a protectorate of the Indian Government while maintaining its autonomy. In 1952, the Sikkim Legislative Assembly was to consist of 17 members, five of whom were to be nominated by the Maharaja.\n\nViolent protests in the early 1970s when agitators demanded a more democratic constitution for Sikkim, as well as more powers for the elected representatives, led to a breakdown of law and order in the princely state. A May 8, 1973 agreement among the Indian government, the Chogyal (Maharaja) and representatives of political parties in Sikkim signalled the princely state\u2019s first brush with democracy. In April 1975, the Sikkim Assembly abolished the institution of the Chogyal and declared Sikkim a constituent of India. The same month, the Indian government introduced the 36th Amendment to the Constitution making Sikkim a state of the country."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1975/05/16/archives/sikkim-becomes-an-indian-state-monarchy-ended.html", "page_content": "NEW DELHI, Friday, May 16 (AP)\u2014India formally annexed Sikkim today, making the Himalayan kingdom the country's 22d state.\n\nPresident Fakhruddin All Ahmed completed the absorption of the 2,745\u2010square\u2010mile territory bordering Tibet by ratifying a constitutional amendment that makes Sikkim's 200,000 inhabitants Indian citizens and its once\u2010absolute ruler a commoner.\n\nThe Indian Parliament approved the amendment last month by overwhelming majorities, with opposition coming only from militant Communists who wanted the monarchy abolished but favored Sikkim's retaining internal autonomy without becoming a full state.\n\nThe demand for statehood originated among antiroyalists in Sikkim, who gained power after an uprising two years ago against the Chogyal, Palden Thondup Namgyal, the last hereditary monarch in a dynasty that goes back 300 years."}, {"url": "https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/this-day-in-history-may16/", "page_content": "This Day In History May - 16\n\nSikkim Becomes India's 22nd State - [May 16, 1975] This Day in History\n\nOn 16 May 1975, the Himalayan Kingdom of Sikkim became the 22nd state of India, ending the monarchy ruling there from the 17th century. This article will give details on how Sikkim became the 22nd state of India within the context of the IAS Exam.\n\nEvents that led to the Inclusion of Sikkim\n\n\n\nThe present erstwhile monarchy in Sikkim started in the year 1642 with the coronation of Phuntsog Namgyal as the Chogyal or king. The king was also a consecrated Buddhist priest.\n\nThe country was frequently attacked by the Gorkha army of Nepal. Initially, the British establishment in India had good relations with Sikkim. Relations with the British deteriorated and finally in 1861, the British acquired the regions of Darjeeling and the Terai.\n\nThe Treaty of Tumlong in 1861 made Sikkim a protectorate of the British.\n\nAfter India\u2019s independence in 1947, the guarantees of independence that Sikkim had acquired from the British were transferred to the new Indian government.\n\nThe then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru gave special protectorate status for Sikkim, which was to be a \u2018tributary\u2019 of India. This meant that India had control over Sikkim\u2019s external defence, communications and diplomacy.\n\nA semblance of a constitutional government was established under the ruling Chogyal in Sikkim, who was otherwise an absolute monarch.\n\nDuring the Sino-Indian war of 1962, Sikkim was seen as a problematic area for India as skirmishes occurred in the Nathu La pass which connects Sikkim with Tibet.\n\nTrouble started brewing in the Himalayan kingdom in 1970 when there were anti-monarchy demonstrations led by the Sikkim National Congress Party.\n\nIndia was worried that China would use this situation and claim the tiny country as part of Tibet.\n\nIndia appointed a Chief Administrator for Sikkim to oversee the political instability there. Indian troops were also placed.\n\nThe Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal himself requested military help from India to quell the uprising against the royalists.\n\nThe elected Prime Minister of Sikkim Lhendup Dorji was himself an anti-monarchist. He had been elected by the Council of Ministers which was opposed to the continuance of the monarchy in Sikkim.\n\nDorji asked the Indian Parliament to change the status of Sikkim to that of statehood. A referendum was conducted on 14 th April 1975 in which about 97% of the population voted for merger with India.\n\nApril 1975 in which about 97% of the population voted for merger with India.

A popular vote for Sikkim to join the Indian Union failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim was to be a tributary of India, in which India controlled its external defence, diplomacy and communication. A state council was established in 1953 to allow for constitutional government for the Chogyal, which was sustained until 1973.\n\nIn 1962, India and the People's Republic of China went to war. Although Sikkim was an independent country, skirmishes occurred at the Nathula Pass between Indian border guards and the Chinese soldiers. After the war, the ancient pass was shut down (it reopened July 6, 2006).\n\nThe old ruler Tashi Namgyal died in 1963 after suffering from cancer. The last hereditary ruler, the Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal, ascended to the throne in 1965. Trouble began to brew for the crown even before the Chogyal assumed the throne, as Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who had carefully preserved Sikkim's status as an independent protectorate, died in 1964. His daughter Indira Gandhi, who became Prime Minister in 1966, would have little patience for maintaining an independent Sikkim or its monarchy. The chogyal, who responded to the increased pressure by drinking, was viewed by India as politically dangerous, especially after his wife, the American socialite Hope Cooke, published a journal article advocating a return of certain former Sikkimese properties.\n\nIn early 1970 the anti-monarchy Sikkim National Congress Party demanded fresh elections and greater representation for the Nepalese.\n\nIn 1973, anti-royalty riots in front of the palace led to a formal request for protection from India. India worried that an unstable Sikkim would invite China to act on its claims that Sikkim was part of Tibet, and therefore part of China. The Indian government appointed a Chief administrator, Mr. B. S. Das, who effectively wrested control of the country away from the Chogyal.\n\nFrosty relations between the Chogyal and the elected Kazi (Prime Minister) Lhendup Dorji resulted in an attempt to block the meeting of the legislature. The Kazi was elected by the Council of Ministers which was unanimous in its opposition to the retention of the Monarchy.\n\nIndian reserve police were moved in and took control of the streets of Gangtok, the borders were closed and little was known until American climber Caril Ridley happened into the capital and was able to smuggle photos and legal documentation out. When confirmed by China, India\u2019s actions were brought into the spotlight of world awareness, However history had already been written and matters came to a head in 1975, when the Kazi (Prime Minister) appealed to the Indian Parliament for representation and change of status to statehood. On April 14, 1975, a referendum was held, in which Sikkim voted to merge with the union of India. Sikkim became the 22nd Indian State on April 26, 1975. On May 16, 1975, Sikkim officially became a state of the Indian Union and Lhendup Dorji became head of State (chief minister). This was promptly recognised by the United Nations and all countries except China.\n\nThe position of Chogyal was thus abolished, ending the monarchy. In 1982, Palden Thondup succumbed to cancer in the United States."}, {"url": "https://www.thesikkimchronicle.com/tripartite-agreement-sikkims-merger-how-sikkim-became-the-22nd-state-of-india/", "page_content": "Sikkim is a tiny Himalayan state which became part of India inthe year 1976. The State before 1976 was an independent country with a political system based on the monarchy. The history of Sikkim goes back to 1642 when three lamas crowned Phunstong Namgyal as the first Chogyal (spiritual king) of Sikkim.\n\nSikkim remained as an independent state for almost 500 years, when Britishers came to India as an East India company it becomes close friends with the independent Sikkim based on one rationale \u2018Nepal\u2019 , both Britishers and Sikkim disliked Nepal\n\nThe Nepalis or Gorkhas were known as warriors and during the 18th century Nepal continuously used to attack their neighboring states to expand their kingdom which also included Sikkim, due to which the then Chogyal also had to flee to Tibet seeking asylum.\n\nThe Anglo-Nepalese war 1814-1816 was fought between Nepal and Britishers where Nepal lost badly leading to the signing of Treaty of Sugauli 1816 in which Nepal had to give away parts of Sikkim, Kumaon and Garwal which was previously captured by Nepal, then in 1817 Sikkim and Britain also signed a treaty known as the treaty of Titalia according to which Sikkim was subjugated to British jurisdiction but with some independence in addition Britishers gained control over Darjeeling that had been part of Sikkim was now under Britishers.\n\nTill India got Independence the relationship between Sikkim and Britishers was untouched and unchanged however when India got independence in the year 1946 and the Britishers left it wasn\u2019t clear that what would be the relationship between India and Sikkim two major questions was raised. Will Sikkim remain as an external protectorate or would Sikkim become an Indian state?\n\nIn 1950 the Indo-Sikkimese Treaty made Sikkim a Indian protectorate, with India assuming responsibility for the external relations, defense, and strategic communications of Sikkim. Further India also held a right to station its armed forces in Sikkim. The move of signing the treaty was opposed by Sardar Patel and B.N Rao who were the constitutional advisor to the consistent assembly wherein they believed that Sikkim should be treated like other princely states and shouldn\u2019t be given independence meanwhile Jawaharlal Nehru had his reasons which defended the treaty, the first reason was that he was an idealist, he also beloved that force shouldn\u2019t be used against Sikkim, in contrast to it he said: \u201c if we bring a small country like Sikkim within our fold by using force, it would be like killing a fly with a bullet\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, he also believed that if force will be used to capture Sikkim it might invigorate china and encourage it to invade Tibet. However, china in the year 1958 invaded china ending a long period of Tibetan self-rule.\n\nThen after the 1962 India-china war, Sikkim\u2019s monarchy demanded greater external and internal autonomy since after the 1962 war and 1965 war against Pakistan the Indian military presence in Sikkim had been increased which on the other hand the tensions and nervousness was increased of the monarchy in Sikkim.\n\nAfter 1966, the monarchy demanded autonomy in the economy and trade too, the demand originated first when the crown prince Palden Thendup Namgyal became the new Chogyal. Following the timeline on April 4, 1973 protesters gathered outside the Chogyal\u2019s palace demanding end of the monarchy, likewise in the same year. Agreement was signed between Indian government, Chogyal and political parties of Sikkim known as the Tripartite agreement, soon after the agreement elections were announced in which after the elections Kazi Lendup Dorjee who was leading the opposition party against Sogyal became the first chief minister of Sikkim, however, the Tripartite agreement didn\u2019t end the monarchy but on April 7 1975, the Indian government organized a coup against Chogyal and put him under house arrest, after the incident many letters were exchanged between Chogyal and Indira Gandhi.\n\nOn April 26, 1975 the thirty-sixth Amendment Act was introduced by Indian government to make Sikkim part of India. In addition India also organized a referendum in which majority of the people demanded democratic system and on May 16, 1975 Sikkim formally became the 22nd tate India and position of Chogyal was abolished."}, {"url": "https://www.insider.com/countries-used-to-be-monarchies-abolished-history", "page_content": "The Greek monarchy existed from 1832 to 1924, and again from 1935 to 1974.\n\nMembers of the Greek royal family, including King Constantine I (second right).
