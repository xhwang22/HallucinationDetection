He left his homeland in 1919 and began a period of restless wandering in Europe during the 1920s and 1930s, including Hamburg, where he had his first exhibition in 1921 at the Maria Kunde Gallery; Cuba in 1926; and shortly after that, Mexico, where he met Diego Rivera. From 1933 he was based in Sweden and during the Second World War published the Swedish surrealist journal Cr\u00e9ation and the Ars magazine; he also began to produce albums of original prints called the Ars-portfolios, which included his own colour woodcuts, a technique he had first taken up in 1939. After the war he decided to emigrate to America where his work drew a favourable response but just before his departure from Stockholm a fire in his studio destroyed thirty years of work. Yunkers arrived in New York in 1947 and produced six woodcuts in his first year. He sometimes combined different blocks from earlier prints to make new compositions. He taught intermittently at the New School for Social Research in New York from 1947 to 1956, and during the summers from 1948 to 1952 at the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque. Inspired by the New Mexico landscape, the forms and the intensity of colour in his woodcuts changed. He also started to experiment with monotypes, often using textures to manipulate the inking. In 1952 he produced a set of five colour woodcuts under the imprint of the Rio Grande Graphics Workshop which he had helped to establish. But after a desert flash flood destroyed his adobe studio with the loss of much of his work, Yunkers left New Mexico and returned to New York in 1952. He then embarked on the most ambitious print project of his career, the woodcut Polyptych, a summation of fifty years of his life and work. It consisted of five large woodcut panels, which were completed in 1953, after the disastrous collapse of his studio ceiling. The central panel alone was printed in fifty-six colours by hand. In 1955, while in Rome, he produced a series of twelve woodcuts and monotypes entitled Ostia Antica. Thereafter he abandoned the colour woodcut and concentrated on large-scale pastels until 1962, and then on painting with torn-paper collage. In 1960 he produced at the Tamarind Workshop, Los Angeles a suite of nine gestural abstract lithographs entitled Skies of Venice, one of his most important series of prints. The British Museum owns fifteen prints by Yunkers, including the Rio Grande Portfolio, two monotypes and seven colour woodcuts. The largest public holdings are to be found in the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art."}, {"url": "https://www.moma.org/artists/6526", "page_content": "If you would like to reproduce an image of a work of art in MoMA\u2019s collection, or an image of a MoMA publication or archival material (including installation views, checklists, and press releases), please contact Art Resource (publication in North America) or Scala Archives (publication in all other geographic locations).\n\nMoMA licenses archival audio and select out of copyright film clips from our film collection.

He left home at age 14 to pursue a career in visual art, enrolling in what he later identified as the Imperial Academy of Arts in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg), but what may have been the Drawing School of the Society for the Enrichment of the Arts. The Drawing School kept no records, and later Yunkers would fabricate his credentials when he emigrated to the United States. In1919 he moved to Germany, where he had his first solo exhibition in 1921 at the Maria Kunde Galerie in Hamburg; with his earnings from the show he rented a studio. He became familiar with members of the Sturmgruppe, including Nolde, Schmidt, and Rottluff. He later participated in a large Russian avant-garde exhibition with Kandinksy, Archipenko, and Chagall.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe began to travel in 1923, going to Spain, the Canary Islands, Paris, and eventually Cuba in 1926, where he changed his name from \u201cJunkers\u201d to \u201cYunkers\u201d. He lived there until 1927, when, with the rise in political upheaval and the persecution of Leftists, he fled Cuba for Mexico, where he met Diego Rivera. By the end of 1927 he had returned to Europe. He went briefly to Berlin, but the gaining power of the Nazi party spurred his move to Paris. He continued to work on various larger projects, murals for the City Hall in Ivry, and his woodcut series \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d. In 1934 he immigrated to Sweden, where his reputation as a political artist and printmaker preceded him, and he was received with much enthusiasm. He remained in Sweden, while focusing primarily on printmaking, for the next 16 years. While living in Sweden he began to exhibit widely, quickly becoming recognized for his graphic work. His extensive collaborative work for various art publications kept him at the forefront of the European art world, and, despite a 1947 Stockholm studio fire that destroyed nearly ten years of work, he was able to continue to show that year. That summer, he moved to New York and began teaching at the New School for Social Research. His notoriety grew steadily, and his work was quickly acquired by several museums and private collections.

Yunkers soon left Russia for Europe and traveled extensively for the next two decades, settling for long periods in Cuba, France, and Germany.

At times his political investments even outweighed his commitment to his art, and in 1936 he moved to Spain to fight in its civil war. When the war ended in 1939, he moved to Stockholm and began to focus on art making again. He became associated with the Swedish Surrealists and published three journals devoted to art and politics. These handcrafted publications signaled a strong interest in printmaking, and in the 1940s he made many woodblock prints depicting distorted objects and figural compositions that demonstrate the influence of German Expressionism on his work. In 1947, Yunkers moved to New York and began to teach at the New School for Social Research. After four tumultuous marriages, he married one of his former students from the New School, Dore Ashton, in 1952. Ashton became an art critic for the New York Times in 1955, and through her, Yunkers was introduced to the artists who would become known as the Abstract Expressionists. He began drawing with pastel directly on canvas, resulting in large-scale works that recall Color Field painting in their emphasis on the materiality of color. Expanding on this impulse, Yunkers's later work made extensive use of negative space, collage, and monochrome. The influence of Minimalism in this more reduced aesthetic is clear, and his canvases became more object-like. Both printmaking and bookmaking were central to Yunkers's oeuvre. He founded the Rio Grande Workshop in New Mexico (where he also taught) in 1949, publishing an entirely handmade art magazine called Prints in the Desert. In 1969 he illustrated a limited-edition book by the poet Octavio Paz, a collaboration that sparked both a friendship and a number of additional illustrated books in the years to come. Yunkers also produced two large public works on commission: A Human Condition (1966), a mural for Syracuse University, and a tapestry produced for Stony Brook University (1968), both in New York. Yunkers had his first solo exhibition in 1921 at the Maria Kunde Galerie, Hamburg, Germany.

At the end of the decade, the artist worked on two commissioned projects, a mural for Syracuse University called a \u2018Human Condition\u2019 (1966) and a tapestry for Stony Brook University (1968). The same time, he collaborated with the poet Octavio Paz illustrating his book. Octavio became Yunkers\u2019s and the following years, the artist illustrated many of his other writings. Adja Yunkers exhibited a lot in the United States and in Europe, having the retrospectives at the Baltimore Museum of Art (1960), at the Brooklyn Museum (1967), at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, Salt Lake City (1968), at the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City, Mexico (1975) and at the Fine Arts Museum of Long Island in Hempstead, New York (1983). In addition to the above-mentioned teaching posts, Yunkers also worked as a visiting lecturer at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, and Columbia University."}, {"url": "https://fineartlimited.com/about-adja-yunkers/", "page_content": "United States 1900 -1983\n\nPhoto not available at this time.\n\nAdja Yunkers (1900\u20131983) was an American abstract painter and printmaker.

He studied art in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), but from 1917 to 1919 his schooling was interrupted by military service in the Russian army. Yunkers soon left Russia for Europe and traveled extensively for the next two decades, settling for long periods in Cuba, France, and Germany. During much of his early career, Yunkers was active in political as well as artistic movements. At times his political investments even outweighed his commitment to his art, and in 1936 he moved to Spain to fight in its civil war. When the war ended in 1939, he moved to Stockholm and began to focus on art making again. He became associated with the Swedish Surrealists and published three journals devoted to art and politics. These handcrafted publications signaled a strong interest in printmaking, and in the 1940s he made many woodblock prints depicting distorted objects and figural compositions that demonstrate the influence of German Expressionism on his work. In 1947, Yunkers moved to New York and began to teach at the New School for Social Research. After four tumultuous marriages, he married one of his former students from the New School, Dore Ashton, in 1952. Ashton became an art critic for the New York Times in 1955, and through her, Yunkers was introduced to the artists who would become known as the Abstract Expressionists. He began drawing with pastel directly on canvas, resulting in large-scale works that recall Color Field painting in their emphasis on the materiality of color. Expanding on this impulse, Yunkers's later work made extensive use of negative space, collage, and monochrome. The influence of Minimalism in this more reduced aesthetic is clear, and his canvases became more object-like. Both printmaking and bookmaking were central to Yunkers's oeuvre. He founded the Rio Grande Workshop in New Mexico (where he also taught) in 1949, publishing an entirely handmade art magazine called Prints in the Desert. In 1969 he illustrated a limited-edition book by the poet Octavio Paz, a collaboration that sparked both a friendship and a number of additional illustrated books in the years to come. Yunkers also produced two large public works on commission: A Human Condition (1966), a mural for Syracuse University, and a tapestry produced for Stony Brook University (1968), both in New York. Yunkers had his first solo exhibition in 1921 at the Maria Kunde Galerie, Hamburg, Germany. Later that same year, he was part of a group show featuring Eastern European and Russian artists, including Alexander Archipenko, Marc Chagall, and Vasily Kandinsky, held in Hannover, Germany. He was included in an exhibition organized by the Print Council of America entitled American Prints Today. A snapshot of the state of American printmaking at the time of the exhibition. Among the many featured artists were Josef Albers, Leonard Baskin, Ralston Crawford, Adolf Dehn, Fritz Glarner, Grace Hartigan, Jasper Johns, Ynez Johnston, John Paul Jones, Misch Kohn ..."}, {"url": "https://www.indexgalleries.com/Adja-Yunkers-biography/179", "page_content": "Adja Yunkers\n\nView Adja Yunkers Gallery of Works\n\nAdja Yunkers (Russian / American, 1900\u20131983) was born in Riga, Russia and spent his childhood in Petrograd.
