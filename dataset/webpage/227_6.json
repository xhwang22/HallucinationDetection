Other daily editions include The Asian Wall Street Journal, edited in Hong Kong, and The Wall Street Journal Europe, edited in Brussels.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal was founded by Charles H. Dow, of Dow Jones & Company, primarily to cover business and financial news. The first issue was published on July 8, 1889. The newspaper\u2019s accuracy and the breadth and detail of its coverage won it respect and success from the start. From its founding until early in the Great Depression, the Journal rarely ventured beyond business and economic news. Then, however, it began to carry occasional feature articles on other subjects. After World War II this trend increased, and by the 1960s the Journal regularly carried two feature articles on page one that only occasionally addressed business subjects, and then in a whimsical or amusing way.\n\nAlthough perceived as favouring the interests of businesses, the Journal\u2019s opinion and editorial pages reflect a wide range of highly informed business, political, and economic opinions; readers\u2019 letters; and reviews of and comments on the arts. The long-established structure of the Journal includes complete tables reporting all financial and stock market activity for the preceding day as well as thorough reports and analyses of current business topics. Published Monday through Friday, the U.S., Asian, and European editions of the Journal had a combined circulation of more than two million at the turn of the 21st century. The U.S. Journal added a weekend edition in 2005. The Journal\u2019s sister publications have included the financial magazine Barron\u2019s, the Far Eastern Economic Review, and SmartMoney.\n\nIn 2007 media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation acquired Dow Jones & Company, publisher of the Journal. The Journal subsequently launched a series of initiatives including the Wall Street Journal Europe Future Leadership Institute (2007), a joint venture with business schools and universities across Europe, designed to enhance readership and cultivate future business leaders; WSJ. (2008), an international lifestyle magazine; and an expansion of both its national and international coverage beyond the business and financial realm (2008). In 2013 News Corporation divided its print and its television and film holdings into separate conglomerates, and ownership of the paper was transferred to the reconstituted News Corporation.\n\nThe Journal has received more than 35 Pulitzer Prizes for its coverage of such events as the September 11 attacks (2001) and American corporate scandals (2003)."}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/a-design-lesson-from-the-wall-street-journal/374059/", "page_content": "A lesson in how tech, workflow, and design come together to make something look just so\n\nOn the morning of Sept. 12, 2001, The Wall Street Journal was missing what most other papers on the planet considered a critical element: Photography of what had happened the day before.\n\nThe only image on the front page was a simple gray map of the East Coast, with black dots showing key places related to the terrorist attacks.\n\n\"We didn't run a photo, where I think every other paper in the world, including the international edition of the Journal, ran a photo,\" said senior visual editor Jessica Yu.\n\nWall Street Journal\n\nThe Journal, which turns 125 today, long resisted photography. It was a numbers paper, the thinking went, devoted to covering the financial markets and forces that shape the economy. It was text heavy and serious and there was no room\u2014nor any real need\u2014for images.\n\nHere's the first ever issue of the paper on July 8, 1889.\n\nWall Street Journal\n\nAll that text and the Journal was still less dizzying than its old rival, The New York Times, on that day. (The Times was, for those who are counting, 38 years old when the Journal was founded.)\n\nNew York Times\n\nBut compare the Journal's first-ever paper with this vision of how it might have covered the news from that day with 2014 sensibilities\u2014and note that the paper keeps its two-cent price tag but acquires the mark of its modern owner, News Corp, in this alternate reality.\n\nWall Street Journal\n\n\"I think the two most significant changes that the Journal has gone through have been the introduction of color and the introduction of photography,\" Yu said.\n\n\"Needless to say, we were not first when it came to photos and color but we've definitely adopted them in a big way,\" she continued. \"We have humongous photos on our front page.\"\n\nIt took some major technological changes for that to happen. In fact, the same workflow that prevented photography for so long was also directly tied to all kinds of design decisions, including the use of the Journal's famous stipple drawings\u2014those dotted portraits of columnists and newsmakers\u2014and the typeface used in the paper.\n\n\"When I first joined the paper, they were still pencil editing, which really blew my mind,\" said Jim Pensiero, who is deputy managing editor at the Journal and has been on staff at the paper since 1984. \"There was no technology in the newsroom at that time.\"\n\nSo the process of turning pencil-edited stories in the afternoon into newspapers that landed on subscribers' doorsteps the next morning was, by today's standards, almost unbelievably complex. The newsroom would fax its stories to composing rooms in places like Chicopee, Massachusetts and Naperville, Illinois, where the stories would be typed into a computer.\n\n\"From the computer, they then make cold type, strips of paper which you would then paste on a board,\" Pensiero said. \"Once you made up the pages, the pages would then be photographed, and you'd make this huge negative. And from the huge negative, we would scan it\u2014we were really quite visionary in digital scanning\u2014then put them up on the satellite and they would end up at satellite printing plants.\"\n\n\"When I first joined the paper, they were still pencil editing, which really blew my mind.\"\n\nFrom there, at 19 printing plants across the country, the Journal would be printed. And so, with each step that got the paper closer to being complete\u2014to the point when it was transmitted to one of those 19 plants\u2014the look of the thing warped. The contours of ink letters swelled along the way, which meant every decision about how the paper ought to look was tethered to this multistep process. It's why the Journal used a proprietary typeface called Dow Text, because for Dow Text to appear on the page the way the paper's leaders wanted it to, it had to bleed just enough but not too much.\n\n\"It's almost like taking a picture of a picture of a picture,\" Pensiero told me. \"You imaged the words on this piece of paper. You put the piece of paper down on the board. You took a photograph of the piece of paper, You made a negative. You transmitted it. You reimaged it. You made a plate... Each time you did that, it kind of bled a little. Dow Text was meant to bleed through all of those reimagings and then, when you actually printed it, it looked fine.\"\n\nUntil, that is, the printing process simplified. When there were fewer steps, Dow Text bled less, and suddenly it looked \"kind of thin and washed out.\" In 2005, the Journal began using a new typeface\u2014this one called Exchange\u2014in overseas papers. The paper rolled out Exchange domestically in 2007. \"It's a little crisper for the electronic methods that we use for creating the paper,\" said Bob Rosenthal, a technology consultant at the Journal. \"We have to look pretty close to really see the difference but it is a new typeface that has historical connections.\"\n\nAnother subtle change that happened around the time of the typeface switch: The iconic period at the end of \"The Wall Street Journal\" flag\u2014the banner across the top of the front page that says the paper's name\u2014was plumped up. \"That round period became oval over the years,\" Rosenthal said. \"It was somewhere around 2008 or 2009 when the design director redrew that banner completely and the period became circular again.\"\n\nToday, photographs are a mainstay on the front page. (Online, the Journal has done much experimentation with visuals, with a major focus on video in recent years.) Getting to this point was gradual, just like the eventual oblongification of the period on the front page.\n\n\"We affectionately call the standalone photo on our front page the lion door,\" said visual editor Yu. That's because, as deputy editor in chief Matt Murray explained it to me, the first photos ever to appear on the front page were tiny rectangles pushed so far down on the page that, \"somebody said, 'that looks like a cat door.'\"\n\nSo, in classic Journal fashion, a more grandiose term\u2014for larger and more centrally placed photos\u2014was coined. Yes, the language of the Wall Street Journal's design is impossibly Wall Street-esque, steeped in the words of finance. There's talk of \"diamonds,\" the dingbats used as bullet points on the front page, and \"champagne,\" the shaded color of the paper beneath the front-page \"what's news\" column. It is these simple details, long-time Journal staffers say, that characterize the paper's aesthetic to its most devoted readers.\n\n\"What you have to remember about the Journal is that a lot of times the form follows the function,\" Pensiero said. \"It wasn't designed to be Life magazine. It wasn't meant to be pretty... Sometimes human institutions become inertia-bound. We had a look and we kept it and we kept it and we kept it. Did we keep it too long? Maybe.\"\n\nAnd yet, some traditions are worth keeping. Those famous stipples\u2014hedcuts, as they're called in-house\u2014can be done by computers these days. \"But you do need a human eye to kind of distinguish hair and face and eyes,\" said Yu. \"You can really tell [if a computer is behind a hedcut] when someone is cross-eyed.\" Her colleagues agree there's something special about the original method, which requires huge hand-drawn portraits that are covered in vellum, scanned, and then shrunk.\n\n\"I just don't think the ones I've seen done programmatically are as beautiful,\" Pensiero said."}, {"url": "https://www.cognitomedia.com/our-thinking/financial-times-vs-wall-street-journal-round-2", "page_content": "The FT and the WSJ matter more to financial services audiences than any other outlets (let\u2019s talk Bloomberg another day). A piece I wrote comparing the two two years ago has proved popular, so here\u2019s a check-in on our two favorite papers.\n\nI\u2019ve clustered my thoughts into five themes: commercial, products, news approach, journalists and leadership.\n\nCommercial\n\nRelative to many other media owners, Nikkei and Murdoch can be reasonably satisfied. The FT has now hit 1 million paying readers, a year ahead of its target. Digital subscribers, three quarters of the total, are up 11% year-on-year. Digital growth at the WSJ has been faster at 23%, with around 1.7 million digital subscribers and close to 3 million subscribers overall.\n\nThe FT has a slight premium \u2013 it\u2019s roughly 20% more expensive than the Journal \u2013 though the multitude of packages makes it hard to calculate. The WSJ discounts new subscriptions more aggressively, while the FT undertakes \u201creach and return\u201d paid-for trials to lure new readers into its hard paywall (highly successful after 17 years).\n\nCommercially the two papers only somewhat compete. The great bulk of WSJ readers are in the US, most FT readers are outside it. FT digital subscriptions in the US are however up 38%, and it\u2019s pushing hard. Its internationalist, somewhat independent, positioning is apparently helping it in the current climate, not least as a complementary second paper. A new syndication deal with the LA Times also helps.\n\nThe Journal \u2013 unlike the FT or the NY Times \u2013 agreed to participate in Apple News Plus despite the swingeing 50% revenue cut taken by Apple. Subscribers will get a range of Journal news for $10 a month in your Apple News sub. The Journal says this is \u201cmore snackable\u201d (awful expression) and doesn\u2019t envisage cannibalization of its subscriber base.\n\nProducts\n\nBoth papers are now complex universes with a multitude of additional products for different professional audiences. \u201cCommunity building\u201d is part of that, and the FT\u2019s Due Diligence M&A service is now developing a members-only forum. The WSJ, beyond its established CFO and CIO titles, now offers premium news for bankruptcies, VC, Private Equity, M&A and cyber through WSJ Pro. Neither title is good at telling us how well all these services are doing (indeed they are rather discreet about what they cost).\n\nBoth are trying to build mass affluent reader communities. This may be easier in the compact UK, where the FT Weekend Festival has taken off, but it\u2019s a formula that is hard to scale.\n\nThe FT keeps promoting a wide range of initiatives, including school subscriptions, the Long Story Short email, and its Tech Scroll Asia newsletter cooperation with Nikkei. Perhaps most significant is the FT\u2019s Sifted, a new media site for tech entrepreneurs in Europe which is live and well-staffed from the core FT and beyond.\n\nNews approach and style\n\nWhile the FT is different to many papers, its style is unmistakably British. This is news that can unapologetically carry a viewpoint.\n\nThe Journal has a style guide (available to buy) and a somewhat more formal way of writing news. Its op-ed pages have a more separate editorial board, as is common in the US. The FT\u2019s writing often has more flair, though sometimes this can result in a news piece diving into analysis but forgetting to tell the reader a needed fact or two.\n\nIn terms of news selection, the Journal today has perhaps more comprehensive coverage of company results than the FT, especially in print, though neither paper now gives a lot of space to small cap stocks.\n\nJournalists\n\nBoth papers give out rough journalist numbers, but an accurate count, whether via LinkedIn or media databases, is hard due to factors like double counting, how to classify freelancers, video roles etc and so on.\n\nThe WSJ has roughly 900 editorial staff worldwide compared with around 680 at the Financial Times. On my calculation, about 66% of FT journalists are based in UK, compared with about 61% of WSJ reporters in the US. Despite those numbers, the WSJ is more of an American paper than the FT is a British paper. That\u2019s both because the US is a continent, and because of the FT sees itself as an international elite paper that happens to be based in London. A poll of EU Brussels decision-makers found 62% rank the FT as a top influencer, way ahead of the WSJ at 38%.\n\nThe Journal has multiple journalists based in US cities beyond NY and Washington (16 in LA, 4 in Pittsburgh for example). The precipitous decline of traditional city daily papers across the US is creating opportunities for the WSJ (and the NY Times). The FT, in contrast, has just a couple of reporters in the UK based outside London, with light coverage of UK regional stories.\n\nIn many areas, the staffing levels at the FT and the Journal look evenly matched, such as financial services, technology, and markets. Both have invested in bigger investigative teams, as epitomized in the Journal\u2019s John Carreyou winning the FT Business Book award for his Theranos book, and the FT\u2019s writing on the Presidents Club and on Wirecard.\n\nThe WSJ brings strength to parts of the US markets that the FT cannot match, such as 14 people on the real estate beat, and sizable bankruptcy and legal teams. It also, surprisingly, has bigger teams than the FT in Paris and Berlin.\n\nAlphaville \u2013 the FT\u2019s markets insiders\u2019 site \u2013 has been a jewel for the paper. The WSJ askews this level of informality.\n\nThe FT is undoubtedly stronger in highbrow arts journalism and in its coverage of the business of arts and the fashion business. Combined with the ad money machine \u201cHow to Spend It,\u201d this gives the FT exceptional reach with international ultra-high net worth audiences. The Journal\u2019s strength with US wealth audiences seems based more on its core business reporting (and its sister outlet Barron\u2019s), though its magazine punches well in the crowded US wealth lifestyle media market.\n\nPersonal finance coverage is more domestically oriented for both papers, though FTfm covers institutional asset management Europe-wide in a way the WSJ does not match.\n\nLeadership\n\nHere the difference between the two papers is starkest.\n\nThe latter days of former WSJ editor Gerard Baker were controversial in his newsroom and beyond. Rightly or wrongly, he was seen as soft on Trump, and the paper saw a fair number of departures. His departure last summer into a senior writing role seemed sudden, with his low profile deputy Matt Murray taking over (to be fair, a published author and WSJ veteran).\n\nThis is a big contrast with the FT, where Lionel Barber has been a high profile editor since 2005, giving punchy views on Brexit, Trump and cricket. Now that there are credible stories that he is preparing to step down, his City University speech in November looks like a swan song. He cited threats to financial journalism\u2019s future, including \u201cblack PR\u201d, legal gagging, new concepts of confidentiality, and the loss of transparency with the rise of private markets.\n\nBarber has 68k Twitter followers and dives into issues most days, while so far the Journal\u2019s Murray, with 14k followers, is much more reticent. The putative in-house successors to Barber are all less extrovert (and pugnacious) than him, and it will be interesting to see how the succession goes.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nOverall the mood music seems much more positive at the FT, now just back in its historic City of London home at Bracken House, after a gap of several decades. Critically the FT seems better at telling its own story in the media and online than the Journal \u2013 perhaps because being owned by Nikkei is very different from being part of a quarterly-reporting News Corp.\n\nBoth papers put out hundreds of pages a day with multiple sub brands and products. Everyone has differing perceptions of the two papers. The FT often seems more nimble, but needs to keep scaling up from a small home base. The Journal has a very substantial international newsgathering operation that could do with more profile and more commercial and product maximization.\n\nAndrew Marshall is based in Cognito's London office"}, {"url": "https://www.mistercartoon.com/about/", "page_content": "Born and raised in Los Angeles, Mister Cartoon was immersed in art from an early age.
