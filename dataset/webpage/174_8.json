During the apparent ambush, Chio revealed, one of the bullets travelled across the highway and struck a vehicle parked outside a nearby church.\n\nAfter the shooting, according to Chio, the Hells Angels bikers headed toward a Harley-Davidson dealer, where they attempted to hide their bikes before fleeing the area.\n\nThose new details emerged Thursday during an arraignment hearing in Henderson Justice Court for 66-year-old Richard Devries, president of the Hells Angels Las Vegas chapter, and recruits Russell Smith, 46, and Stephen Alo, 26.\n\nThe trio have been in police custody since their arrests Sunday evening, each held on $380,000 bail.\n\nBail arguments\n\nDuring Thursday's hearing, Chio asked Justice of the Peace David Gibson to raise bail to $1 million, while defense lawyers Richard Schonfeld and Tom Pitaro argued for lower bail, calling the $380,000 collateral \"excessive.\"\n\nThe judge ultimately denied both requests, keeping bail at $380,000 \u2014 which Gibson described as a \"big enough number\" that would \"make somebody think again\" before committing a crime.\n\n\"I believe that there is clear and convincing evidence that all of these defendants are a danger to the community,\" Gibson said.\n\nAccording to the defense attorneys, none of the defendants have a serious criminal record, and, therefore, do not pose a risk to the community. In addition, the lawyers said, their clients have deep ties to the community.\n\nDevries, a military veteran who, according to Schonfeld, was honorably discharged, has lived in Nevada for close to two decades.\n\nAlo, meanwhile, is employed and married with one daughter. He has been a Nevada resident nearly his entire life, Pitaro said. Similarly, Smith is married, employed and owns his Southern Nevada home.\n\n\"When we look at the stability factors,\" said Pitaro, who is representing both Alo and Smith, \"how do we predict the future based upon the past? All three of these men, quite truthfully, your honor, have nothing in their past that would give the court a concern for the future.\"\n\nGibson responded: \"I can't predict the future, but I can kind of control it.\"\n\nThe rivalry\n\nDevries, Alo and Smith are scheduled to return to court on June 14.\n\nBoth Vagos and the Hells Angels, which was founded in Fontana, California, in the late 1940s, are classified as outlaw motorcycle gangs by the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nTheir violent rivalry can be traced back to the Vagos gang's attempts to expand its territory, authorities have said, including a push about a decade ago into the Hells Angels' long-claimed territory of Santa Cruz.\n\nBy late 2011, the turf war would spill into Nevada, where a shootout between the clubs broke out inside a Sparks casino that ended with the death of Hells Angels leader Jeffrey Pettigrew.\n\nRio Lacanlale is the Las Vegas correspondent for the Reno Gazette Journal and the USA Today Network.

USA are in the middle of the Vietnam War, Martin Luther King has recently marched from Selma to Montgomery and Roger Miller\u2019s \u2018King of the Road\u2019 is number one. Thirteen bikers meet on the corner of Eighth and Davidson in San Bernardino, California to form the Vagos Motorcycle Club, beginning a history that would involve drug trafficking, clashes with the police and a violent rivalry with the Hells Angels.\n\nThe elected president was Rudy Esparza, nicknamed Puro, who led the new club in selecting their name. Other names considered included Coffin Dogers MC and Satan\u2019s Saints MC, but Vagos MC, Spanish for vagabond, was chosen. Their new patch, a red devil on a green background, was inspired by an image of a devil in LIFE magazine entitled \u2018Return from hell.\u2019\n\nMore Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs (OMGs) were established in the 1960s than in any other decade. The outlaw status is given to groups who are not sanctioned by the American Motorcyclists Association (AMA). They are also known as 1%ers, a term which originated after the Hollister biker riot in 1947 when the AMA allegedly claimed the 99% of bikers were law abiding citizens, although the AMA have no record of issuing this as an official or public statement.\n\nBikers would often move between clubs or find their club being absorbed into a larger club. Puro had previously been with the Psychos MC and others joined from clubs including El Diablo MC. The question of whether the Vagos would absorb or be absorbed was very quickly answered as more Chapters sprang up across California. In 2014 the FBI listed the Vagos as one of the largest Outlaw Motorcycle Groups in Western America with 600 members in 24 Chapters throughout America, as well as Chapters in Canada, Mexico and Europe.\n\nThe Mafia on wheels?\n\nDescribed by Vagos infiltrator Charles Falco as \u201cthe mafia on wheels\u201d the Vagos have more than earned their 1%er patch. Drug related arrests have been made throughout their colourful history. In 1987 the head of the South Bay Chapter and President of the Desert Hot Springs Chapter along with three others all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute methamphetamines. Over 40 pounds of cocaine and eight pounds of methamphetamines (and a rocket launcher!) were seized in a 2011 raid. And in 2014 four Vagos members were arrested by the FBI for selling methamphetamines.\n\nAlongside money laundering and weapons trafficking, the Vagos are also known for their general violence, especially with rival OMGs. As the Vagos attempted to expand their territory tension erupted between them and other OMGs most notably the Hells Angels. In 2001 a bloody melee broke out between the Vagos and the Angels in the Californian city of Costa Mesa. And in 2010 an argument over which gang got to hang out in the Starbucks in Santa Cruz escalated. A brawl outside the coffee shop led to a gunfight in Chino Valley, several drive by shootings and a bitter feud.\n\nThe authorities have successfully infiltrated the Vagos a number of times. George Rowe, a street criminal whose friend had disappeared after an incident with the Vagos, volunteered to go undercover as part of Operation 22 in 2003. His evidence gathered over 3 years resulted in 42 arrests and convictions for crimes as serious as murder. Whilst Charles Falco worked his way up to number two of the Victorville Chapter and provided the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) gathering enough information to make 62 arrests for crimes including assault and murder. Fun fact, both Rowe and Falco have written books about their experiences and actually appear as characters in each other\u2019s books.\n\nHowever the Vagos have their own weapon in their ongoing battle with the police- the lawsuit. In 1990 the Vagos sued the police and received a $2 million settlement claiming they were targets of massive police abuse in the early eighties. And in 2010 when the Vagos were blamed for a spree of homemade booby traps that targeted the police, they once again sued and received a settlement that included a public statement and the return of property seized the previous year.\n\n1%ers\n\nAs with all criminal groups the Vagos don\u2019t advertise their more notorious crimes. Their PR website vagosmcworld.com, presents them as a club rather than a gang. Their consistent response to arrests is that it is not all of their members committing crimes, but a few bad apples. So, organised crime syndicate or a club where just 1% of the 1%ers are giving them a bad name\u2026?"}, {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hells-angels-and-vagos-motorcycle-gangs-in-arizona-shootout-say-cops/", "page_content": "CHINO VALLEY, Ariz. (CBS/AP) It sounds like a scene out of a movie, but for one Arizona neighborhood it was a frightening and violent reality when two rival motorcycle gangs exchanged gunfire in the middle of the street, according to police and witnesses.\n\nWitnesses say that trouble started Saturday afternoon when a group of bikers, who reportedly belong to the Vagos motorcycle gang, rode past a house where another group of bikers, reported to be Hells Angels, were having a party.\n\n\n\nThe Hells Angels allegedly opened fire on the Vagos riders who then returned fire, CBS affiliate KPHO reported.\n\nDozens of Arizona law enforcement officers descended on the area after dispatchers started receiving calls about gunshots, including members of the Arizona State Gang Task Force, Yavapai Sheriff's spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said.\n\nWhen the dust settled, 27 people were booked on charges ranging from attempted murder and aggravated assault to participation in a criminal street gang. At least five people were shot, but none of the injuries were life threatening, according to D'Evelyn.\n\nDetectives estimate at least 50 rounds were fired during the shootings.\n\nThe Hells Angels have owned the two-story gray house where the shootout occurred for a few years, and apparently used it as a sort of clubhouse. But when the Vagos reportedly moved into a house just up the street, neighbors say they knew a turf war was brewing, according to KPHO.\n\nStill, the violence was not what most would expect in the rural area just north of Prescott, Ariz.\n\n\"Yesterday, I got caught in gunfire by two biker gangs,\" Jon Humen told the station. \"I moved here from Phoenix to get away from this.\"\n\nInvestigators remained in Chino Valley on Sunday, examining and recovering evidence. Several motorcycles were impounded and detectives were trying to locate one injured gang member who was helped away from the scene in an unknown vehicle, D'Evelyn said.\n\nIn December, an Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman said an ongoing power struggle in northwestern Arizona between the Vagos and the Hells Angels had led to a series of violent assaults."}, {"url":

Motorcycle Club who were accused of being involved in a 2010 shootout with Vagos, a rival gang.\n\n\n\nThe two clubs shot it off in Chino Valley, north of Prescott, in August 2010, as at least 50 shots were fired, although no one was seriously injured.\n\n\n\nRichard Gaxiola, an attorney for one of the alleged Angels, tells New Times that the only direct witness to the confrontation between the gangs immediately before the shooting happened to be a paid confidential informant -- a fact that wasn't presented to him or the other attorneys for quite some time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The only witness to the incident was a confidential police informant at the time who tried to infiltrate the Hells Angels, was rebuked, and had substantial biases against the Angels to begin with,\" Gaxiola says.\n\n\n\nThe informant, Alfred Acevedo, had become a \"hanger on\" with Vagos, while working as an informant for an Arizona Department of Public Safety detective named John Morris.\n\n\n\nThe night of the shooting, Acevedo and another man were at a Circle K store picking some things up for the \"Tri-State President\" of Vagos, Ruben Lopez.\n\n\n\nWhile Acevedo was at the store, some Hells Angels -- identified by their getup -- walked into the store, and one of the men asked Acevedo about his Vagos t-shirt.\n\n\n\nAcevedo then called back the Vagos house in town, telling them about a \"confrontation\" with the Angels, and he was told to wait there while some Vagos came by to help.\n\n\n\nAcevedo said he watched the Hells Angels from across the street, and followed the group of Vagos members when they rolled up.\n\n\n\nBut Acevedo claimed he got \"lost,\" and by the time he got back to the Vagos house, the shootings had already happened.\n\n\n\nTwenty-seven people were arrested after that shooting, while five were indicted by a grand jury.\n\n\n\nThe case was remanded to a second grand jury, in which seven were indicted: John Bernard, Kevin Christiansen, Kiley Hill, Robert Kittredge, Michael Koepke, Larry Scott Jr., and Bruce Schweigert.\n\n\n\nThrough both of those grand juries, Yavapai County Sheriff's Office Detective David Zavos failed to mention that Acevedo was an informant, despite Zavos stating that he was aware of this during both.\n\n\n\nDeputy County Attorney Dana Owens, who was prosecuting the case, didn't find out that Acevedo was an informant until February 2011, when someone decided to fill her in.\n\n\n\nHowever, according to Yavapai County Superior Court Judge Cel\u00e9 Hancock's ruling, it appears that Owens still didn't disclose this information to defense attorneys during an evidentiary hearing later that month, although Hancock didn't find her responsible for purposely withholding anything.\n\n\n\nHancock ruled to dismiss the case against the five men, but did so without prejudice, which allows the state to file the charges again and start the process over.\n\n\n\n\"Acevedo's status as a paid informant and as the only direct witness to a confrontation that led to the shootings in this case is material and clearly exculpatory,\" Hancock writes.\n\n\n\nChief Deputy County Attorney Dennis McGrane confirmed to New Times that his office will submit the charges again, but declined to comment on the strength of the prosecution's case in an attempt to \"avoid the appearance of trying a case in the media.\"\n\n\n\nGaxiola, who filed the motion to dismiss the case -- which the rest of the Angels joined in on -- wanted the charges dismissed for good, claiming that everyone's failure to identify Acevedo as an informant was intentional.\n\n\n\nHancock did write at one point that Acevedo's failed attempt to join the Hells Angels \"gives rise to possible issues of bias and veracity.\"\n\n\n\nAcevedo has also worked as an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as well as the Gang and Immigration Intelligence Team Enforcement Mission task force in other parts of the state.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hells-angels-gang-fight-w_n_1062730", "page_content": "Two people died, eight suffered gun shot wounds and dozens

Security is tight for Tausan's funeral, reports SF Gate, and police hope to stem the tide of growing biker violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMounting tensions between the Hells Angels and Vagos motorcycle clubs erupted in January 2010, when members of each club fought each other over territory at a Starbucks cafe in Santa Cruz, Calif. Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark analyzed the situation for Reuters, saying, \"It was all about who would be allowed to hang out at the Starbucks downtown... Only in Santa Cruz would you have biker wars over who's going to control pumpkin spice lattes.\" In this case, it was the Vagos who were encroaching on turf that had been considered part of Hells Angels territory.\n\nThe fight spread to other states and continued to escalate. In August 2010, 27 members of the Vagos and the Hells Angels were arrested in Arizona for taking part in a shoot out that resulted in at least five wounded victims. According to CBS News, the violent confrontation took place shortly after the Vagos moved in nearby to a house owned by the Hells Angels. At least 50 rounds of ammunition were exchanged between the two gangs during a house party, reports CBS affiliate KPHO.\n\nThe violence crossed state lines again and turned deadly in September 2011. A Hells Angels leader named Jeffrey \"Jethro\" Pettigrew, chapter president of the San Jose California Hell's Angels, was shot to death on the floor of a Nevada casino, reports the San Jose Mercury News. He and thousands of other bikers were in Sparks, Nevada for the annual \"Street Vibrations\" biker festival when a skirmish between the Hells Angels and the Vagos erupted on the floor of the John Ascuaga's Nugget Casino Resort in Sparks. In addition to Pettigrew, two Vagos members were wounded but taken to the hospital in stable condition, according to the Mercury News.\n\nThe next day, another motorcyclist was shot in the stomach by someone driving a car, reports ABC News.

Each has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Each could face up to 40 years in prison if convicted of attempted murder with a weapon.\n\nThe judge instructed prosecutors to revise the indictment. A hearing in the case remained scheduled Wednesday.\n\nPolice said seven people were treated at hospitals for wounds or injuries following the gunfire that erupted among motorcycle riders on Interstate 11 in Henderson after a Memorial Day weekend ceremony at a veterans cemetery in Boulder City.\n\nSchonfeld argued March 31 that Mollasgo, a Hells Angels associate but not a full member, was treated for a gunshot wound, and that police at the scene examined handguns that some of the alleged Vagos had with them, but returned them.\n\n\u201cThe grand jury doesn\u2019t know that a Hells Angels-affiliated individual (was) shot and that four Vagos members had firearms concealed on their person,\u201d Schonfeld said.

How could they not be? For many years, it was a well-trafficked Hells Angels hangout. Members of the colorfully named Skull Valley chapter, which was the Angels\u2019 main garrison in north-central Arizona until disbanding in 2006, used it as their clubhouse. A biker still lived there, but he was ailing and infirm, tethered to oxygen tanks and a motorized scooter. The house \u2013 which once roared with all-night bacchanals and fleets of hard-revving Harleys \u2013 had been silent for years.\n\nLess well known to the good people of Yuma Drive were the occupants of a house about 300 yards down the road. Michael Diecks and his wife, Leslie, had recently moved into the single-family home with their three children \u2013 an unremarkable arrangement if not for the fact that Diecks, also known as \u201cMad Dog Mike,\u201d was a full-patch member of the Vagos motorcycle club.\n\nThe Hells Angels and Vagos \u2013 also known as \u201cGreen Nation\u201d in the outlaw-biker world for their signature color \u2013 have a chippy history, to put it mildly. As so-called \u201cone-percenter\u201d MCs, they emerged from the same amniotic Southern California/Inland Empire biker culture to become bitter rivals, with the Angels playing the proud, powerful incumbents to the Vagos\u2019 motivated upstarts.

Over whatever.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been going at it since the late \u201960s,\u201d according to Steve Trethewy, a former Arizona Department of Public Safety (DPS) officer who served 25 years on the department\u2019s anti-gang unit. \u201cThey\u2019ll fight, then go dormant, then fight again, then patch things up. It\u2019s all about power and territory.\u201d\n\nHad they been privy to this information, the citizens of Chino Valley might have been less startled by the pop-pop sound of gunfire that raked across Yuma Drive on Saturday, August 21, 2010, shortly after noon. In an instant, their grassy, wide-open neighborhood took on the guise of a Waziristan warzone. The Schafmans \u2013 who declined comment for this article \u2013 told investigators they heard \u201capproximately 100 shots fired\u201d during the 10-minute gunfight, but official estimates put the number closer to 50. The battle left five bikers wounded, netted 27 arrests and resulted in nine indictments. One year after the melee, virtually everything else about the case, which has yet to go to trial, is still in dispute. The Yavapai County Attorney accepts the Vagos\u2019 account of the incident \u2013 in essence, that the Hells Angels fired on them unprovoked as they rode past the two-story stucco house, triggering the fusillade \u2013 while the Hells Angels and their attorneys broadly maintain that it was an ambush on the part of the Vagos.\n\nFor the actors involved, the who-shot-first question is paramount. For the rest of us, not so much. In fact, in a case that stokes age-old questions about Arizona\u2019s most powerful bike club, hints at a potentially violent restructuring of the outlaw-biker pecking order and \u2013 pursuant to court documents obtained by PHOENIX magazine \u2013 reveals provocative details about the crime-fighting methodology of Arizona\u2019s anti-gang units, the question of which band of well-armed hombres shot first seems mostly academic.\n\nBy most accounts, outlaw-biker affiliation is on the rise in Phoenix and elsewhere. So the more pressing question is: Will it happen again? And where?\n\nAs dozens of Yavapai Sheriff\u2019s Office and DPS vehicles swarmed the neighborhood of Yuma Drive shortly after the shooting, a Vagos biker on the scene described the aftermath in no uncertain terms:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a war.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a gang,\u201d Michael Koepke, seated in his lawyer\u2019s office, says evenly. \u201cPeople always slap that thing on us. We\u2019re about brotherhood and riding bikes. And that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nWell-groomed, fit and articulate, Koepke is part of the Hells Angels\u2019 new guard. Even with his wrist-to-wrist tattoos, the 28-year-old ex-Army infantryman and aspiring Muay Thai prize-fighter seems more Team America than America\u2019s Most Wanted. If he traded in the leather cuts for a pair of pleated wool slacks, Koepke could pass for a lawyer himself.\n\nHe\u2019s also one of the six men \u2013 all associated with the Hells Angels\u2019 Arizona Nomads chapter \u2013 facing prison time for the Chino Valley shootout, on a menagerie of charges ranging from aggravated assault to disorderly conduct with a weapon.\n\nKoepke\u2019s objection to the \u201cgang\u201d label isn\u2019t just a matter of semantics; in fact, it carries very tangible legal consequences for the 2,500-member-strong worldwide organization. Arizona\u2019s law enforcement entities \u2013 including its anti-gang task force, the multi-agency Gang & Immigration Intelligence Team Enforcement Mission (GIITEM) \u2013 classify the Hells Angels as a criminal street gang, which means courts can apply enhanced sentencing to lawbreakers. Simple assault becomes a multi-year stretch in prison. A bar fight becomes \u201cfelony riot.\u201d\n\nThe Angels dispute the criteria. They claim to be mischaracterized and misunderstood, victims of a zealous law enforcement camp bent on crushing their authority-averse lifestyle.\n\nOf course, the gang stigma is nothing new for the Hells Angels; it has faithfully accompanied them since the club\u2019s earliest days in the Southern California steel town of Fontana, circa 1948, even as they grew into the world\u2019s biggest and most recognized biker entity. Certainly, they can seem like a gang, with their iconic death-head patches and hard-as-nails mystique, but members readily tick off reason after reason why the \u201cgang\u201d descriptor doesn\u2019t fit. Disavowing the stigma has itself become something of an institutional passion for the bikers; a sort of sacred incantation, like stone-writ Druidic verse. Certainly, the Angels\u2019 larger-than-life reputation can salt the impressions of law enforcement personnel. Last November, Yavapai County Sheriff\u2019s Office Detective David Zavos \u2013 the lead investigator in the Chino Valley case \u2013 offered a grand jury the following impressionistic analysis of the combatants: \u201cThe Vagos, for the most part, are not a real aggressive gang. They are somewhat family oriented, opposed to the Hells Angels, who are more into criminal enterprise.\u201d\n\nThat makes Koepke shake his head. \u201cFamily oriented. I\u2019m not sure what that means. I have a 1-year-old son and a wife, and I\u2019m totally devoted to them. Doesn\u2019t that make me family oriented? I\u2019m not sure what it has to do with anything.\u201d\n\nYavapai County Superior Court Judge William T. Kiger had similar reservations, kicking the original indictments back to a grand jury after weighing Zavos\u2019 testimony \u2013 a short-lived but significant legal victory for the Hells Angels. A defense counsel noted that the Vagos and Hells Angels have near-identical law enforcement profiles; both appear on a Department of Justice list of MCs with suspected involvement in serious crimes such as drug distribution and witness intimidation.\n\nA Vagos member involved in the shootout did not respond to an interview request through an attorney.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Chino Valley case seemed freighted with special small-town tensions. Ironically, one of the accused Angels \u2013 Larry \u201cScotty\u201d Scott, a former college football player and on-again, off-again thoroughbred racehorse owner \u2013 previously coached Zavos\u2019 teenage son in his capacity as the defensive coordinator for a local high school team. \u201c[The detective] told me my days as a coach were done,\u201d Scott, who has since left the team, alleges.\n\nPrivately, the Angels acknowledge that some of their members break the law, perhaps even at a statistical pace higher than non-bikers. But they deny that criminal activity is an institutional part of the Hells Angels culture, or that the club maintains a criminal hierarchy within its ranks, \u00e0 la the Mafia and other corporatized criminal rackets. Richard Gaxiola, a Phoenix-based attorney who represents Koepke and has defended Hells Angels in previous cases, insists that the seven-point Arizona statute for defining a criminal street gang is \u201coverly broad\u201d and a \u201ccrass gambit for GIITEM to justify government funding\u201d by turning the Hells Angels into perennial hobgoblins.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the street-gang criteria \u2013 self-proclamation, official clothing or colors, written correspondence and so on \u2013 then the Blue Knights, which are a national law-enforcement motorcycle club, they\u2019d have to be classified a criminal street gang, too,\u201d Gaxiola says. \u201cAt the end of the day, the Hells Angels is nothing more than a group of guys who love to ride motorcycles and hang out with like-minded individuals. Sure, some of them are knuckleheads, but most have jobs and wives and kids. Most of them are veterans. They\u2019re stand up guys.\u201d\n\nThough some law enforcement figures acknowledge the Angels\u2019 improved public image over the years \u2013 \u201cI call it their spit-and-polish,\u201d one DPS officer says \u2013 others point to ugly incidents, such as the murder of 44-year-old party guest Cynthia Yvonne Garcia by three members of the Mesa chapter in 2001. The Angels disavow the crime. They insist that each of their chapters are semi-autonomous entities with their own bylaws and values, and that applying the crimes of one member to the whole club makes as much sense as, say, penalizing the Phoenix PD for a corruption scandal in the LAPD.\n\n\u201cEverybody is his own man in the Hells Angels,\u201d one longtime member says. \u201cEach chapter governs itself. That\u2019s what the authorities never understand. I mean, there\u2019s a chapter back east that doesn\u2019t even let its members smoke pot. That\u2019s why those conspiracy charges never stick. There\u2019s no conspiracy.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the authorities tend to disagree. \u201cThey\u2019re very well structured,\u201d says Trethewy, now a spokesman for the law-enforcement think tank Rocky Mountain Information Network. \u201cThey have bylaws, they go to meetings and pay dues, they use trademarks and copyrights, and they commit crime. I\u2019d say that makes them a criminal organization.\u201d\n\nTrethewy dismisses the \u201cfew bad apples\u201d notion, citing a recent internal DPS report that suggests the majority of the Arizona Hells Angels \u2013 who number somewhere around 110 \u2013 have rap sheets that include felony arrests: \u201cThat\u2019s not a cross-section of society. I don\u2019t care what you say.\u201d\n\nStill, federal and local authorities have had mixed success making racketeering and conspiracy charges \u2013 the Kanye and Jay Z of anti-organized crime legislation \u2013 stick to the Hells Angels over the years. The ATF\u2019s much-trumpeted, multi-million-dollar Operation Black Biscuit \u2013 touted as \u201cthe most successful undercover operation ever pulled against an outlaw motorcycle club\u201d when it culminated in 2003 \u2013 failed to yield any convictions for the 16 Arizona-based bikers charged with racketeering or running a criminal enterprise.\n\nBlack Biscuit initiated the demise of the Skull Valley chapter and temporarily hobbled the statewide club by jailing several of its top personnel, but in its aftermath, the Arizona Hells Angels were indistinguishable from their old selves: They were still the unquestioned lords of Arizona\u2019s outlaw bikerdom.\n\nIt was hardly routine for the Hells Angels and the Vagos to have more than two dozen combined bikers in Chino Valley on the same weekend. The town was no longer an HA chapter seat, and only one of the Angels charged in the shootout was a Chino Valley resident. Meanwhile, the Vagos were believed to have only a scattered presence in Yavapai County; most of the suspects detained after the shooting were visiting from cities such as Kingman, Phoenix and Bullhead City.\n\nSo what brought them to Chino Valley if not to fight? Both clubs have credible alibis. For the Vagos, it was a bring-your-kids weekend barbecue at the Diecks\u2019 place \u2013 a common enough pastime in the biker world. Meanwhile, the Angels were in town to visit Teddy Toth, the ailing ex-president of the Skull Valley Chapter. Sent to prison following the ATF\u2019s Black Biscuit operation several years prior, Toth had gotten \u201coff paper,\u201d or released from parole, just that weekend. After years of state-mandated biker solitude, he was finally allowed to openly fraternize with his HA confreres.\n\nIt was undoubtedly a case of wrong-place, wrong-time, but to understand the tensions that led to the shootout, one must first examine the unique history of the Arizona Hells Angels and the band of Harley-riding, hirsute rogues that preceded them \u2013 a club called the Dirty Dozen, which ruled the state\u2019s biker community from its inception in the late \u201960s to its merger with the Hells Angels in 1997.\n\nNamed after the iconic World War II action movie starring Lee Marvin and Jim Brown, the Dirty Dozen \u2013 who numbered about 120 during their peak \u2013 offer a useful compare-and-contrast study with the current Hells Angels. The Cliff Notes version: The Dirty Dozen were several degrees more ruthless and aggressive, according to longtime member Robert \u201cChico\u201d Mora, who \u201cpatched-over\u201d to the Hells Angels during the aforementioned merger.\n\n\u201cOh, we were obnoxious assholes,\u201d Mora cheerfully confides when quizzed about the Dirty Dozen. \u201cWe did terrible, depraved stuff all the time. Don\u2019t get me wrong: The Hells Angels are every bit as tough. But it was a different culture back then. Much wilder.\u201d\n\nA massive, wise-cracking hulk of a man with the letters\n\nA-R-I-Z-O-N-A tattooed across his belly and a scraggly mane of gray-streaked hair, Mora exudes Falstaffian delight as he recounts his days as a hell-raising, debauchery-crazed Dozen regular. There were orgies, brawls, all-night block parties and balls-out Harley sprints across greater Phoenix.\n\nIt was a fast, dangerous life. He points to the extensive scarring on his lower legs where surgeons stitched together the two limbs, including the blood vessels underneath, in a successful gambit to save a foot severed in a bike wreck. He was hospitalized for several weeks until the foot healed and doctors de-conjoined him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhotos \u2013 From left: Also known as Green Nation, the Vagos motorcycle club was founded in Corona, California, in 1965. According to the DOJ, the club boasts approximately 600 members spanning 24 chapters in the U.S., and 10 more chapters in Mexico. In Arizona, they are concentrated in Mohave County. \u2022 Founded in Montebello, California in 1969 by Hispanic Vietnam War veterans, the Mongols M.C. memorably brawled with the Hells Angels in the deadly Laughlin, Nevada, riot of 2002. The Latino-majority club is believed to have a tertiary presence in Arizona, including a Mesa chapter that hosts its own Facebook page.\n\n\n\nDirty Dozen lore is full of wild tales. Old timers recall a weekend evening \u2013 sometime in the mid-\u201980s \u2013 when a pair of Dozen bikers cut the fuel lines on a row of rival motorcycles outside a bar in Mesa, creating a sort of daisy chain of flammable spillage. They then lit a makeshift fuse, inducing a spectacular inferno that they admired while munching on Jumbo Jacks down the street.\n\nSo the Dozen were hard-core. They were also intensely territorial, boldly confronting and intimidating any rival club that failed to recognize their primacy in Arizona. In the early 1980s, Mora himself served just more than three years in Florence State Prison for the shooting deaths of two members of Bad Company \u2013 an outlaw bike gang based in New Mexico that was attempting to set up a chapter in the old mining town of Globe. Mora \u2013 who was president of the Dirty Dozen\u2019s Globe chapter at the time \u2013 claims that the Bad Company bikers were harassing members of the community and \u201cacting like jerks.\u201d\n\nMora summoned the two bikers to a popular roadhouse in Globe, where he laid out his ultimatum. \u201cI told them to behave themselves,\u201d Mora recalls. \u201cAnd respect my authority. Then one of them pulled a gun on me. So I defended myself.\u201d\n\nThe Vagos were another out-of-state club that attempted to plant a flag in Arizona during the Dirty Dozen reign, according to Trethewy. In 1990, the Vagos even managed to start a Phoenix chapter in the heart of Dirty Dozen territory, led by a biker named Don \u201cArizona Don\u201d Halterman.\n\nThe honeymoon period was brief.\n\n\u201cFrom what we know, that was the first time [the Dirty Dozen] and the Vagos squared off,\u201d Trethewy says. \u201cThere was some shooting and pipe-bombs. Somebody put a pipe-bomb on Arizona Don\u2019s front door. That was it. There was too much heat on them. The Vagos left Phoenix.\u201d\n\nFor the next seven or eight years, the Dozen ran a tight ship in Arizona. They also won the respect of seminal Hells Angels organizer Sonny Barger, who served out a four-year federal conspiracy conviction in Arizona from 1988 to 1992. By all accounts, Barger \u2013 who later moved to Cave Creek \u2013 took a serious shine to Arizona during his incarceration, which could only have facilitated matters when the Dirty Dozen weighed the Angels\u2019 offer of a friendly merger. In effect, the Dirty Dozen would be trading in their double-six dice emblem for the Angels\u2019 trademarked death-head skull patch.\n\nIn 1997, members of the two clubs convened in the HA clubhouse in Oakland \u2013 a converted Arthur Murray dance studio, of all things \u2013 and the patch-over was consecrated. The benefits for both clubs were manifest. On one hand, the Hells Angels acquired a big, geographically critical state with lots of wide-open roads and no serious rivals, thanks to the Dozen\u2019s cleansing efforts. Conversely, the former Dirty Dozen bikers scored instant prestige as members of the most powerful and recognizable brand in the biker world \u2013 the death-head patch promised them \u201ca bigger playground,\u201d in the words of Mora.\n\nIt also meant embracing the Hells Angels\u2019 more image-savvy and disciplined ethos. According to Mora, the stereotype of the meth-slinging, brawl-seeking, recklessly hostile Hells Angel is a vestige of wilder times \u2013 something that continues to exist on the pages of Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s Hell\u2019s Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs, but not in real life. \u201cI have a three-part gospel for staying the fuck out of prison,\u201d Mora explains. \u201cOne: Don\u2019t commit senseless, needless violence against the citizenry. Two: Don\u2019t sling dope. And three: Don\u2019t print the government\u2019s money. Follow those rules, and the cops will more or less leave you alone.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s an adage in the biker world that the safest neighborhood in any city is the one with a Hells Angels clubhouse. After all, the Angels don\u2019t tolerate any petty crime in their immediate sphere and generally endeavor to avoid scrutiny by the authorities.\n\nThe Hells Angels-as-neighborhood-watchdog theory may very well have stock \u2013 unless they happen to be having a shootout with the Vagos.\n\nThe Chino Valley shootout was not the first time the Hells Angels and Vagos warred on Arizona soil. On June 11, 2009, five members of the Arizona Nomads \u2013 a roving Hells Angels chapter with no official clubhouse \u2013 allegedly mixed it up with a pair of Vagos at Lazy Harry\u2019s Sunshine Saloon in Bullhead City near the Colorado River. Two members of a Hells Angels affiliate club, the Desert Road Riders, were also implicated. It was described by DPS as the biggest \u201cin a series of violent assaults inside several bars\u201d in Bullhead City. Five months later, all seven HA-affiliated combatants were arrested for felony rioting.\n\nThe spike in biker hostilities in Bullhead City initially puzzled authorities, because members of the Vagos\u2019 Tri-State chapter \u2013 based in the string of river towns where Arizona, California and Nevada meet \u2013 had been operating in northwest Arizona since at least 2000 with relatively little incident, according to Sgt. Ernie Severson of GIITEM. \u201cI ran the unit for Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City, and the two gangs mostly kept to themselves,\u201d Severson says. \u201cThe Angels let the Vagos have Havasu. They didn\u2019t really contest it.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the uneasy peace collapsed. And the reason? Severson believes it was a matter of patches.\n\nA quick primer on outlaw biker attire: The vests, or \u201ccuts,\u201d favored by most rank-and-file bikers reveal a deep cache of information about the wearer, via the patches affixed to the front and back of the garment. The front patches denote personal details like rank, exploits and chapter affiliation. The back patches, or \u201crockers,\u201d cover the more organizational stuff. The top rocker indicates the name of the club. The middle patch is the club\u2019s emblem: In the case of the Hells Angels, the famed, winged death-head; in the case of the Vagos, a muscle-bound caricature of the Norse god of mischief, Loki, set against a green field.\n\nThe bottom rocker is particularly critical for American outlaw bikers, and the key to the Bullhead City incidents, in Severson\u2019s opinion: It identifies the wearer\u2019s state of residence. But the \u201cArizona\u201d rockers on the bottom of the cuts worn by the Arizona Hells Angels are more than simple identifiers \u2013 they\u2019re also an expression of status; they confer power and authority, and wearing them is historically a privilege that the most dominant outlaw motorcycle clubs reserve for themselves.\n\nMora, the one-time Dirty Dozen capo and current Arizona Hells Angel, says that he and his Dirty Dozen comrades would scour the streets and bars of Tucson in the early 1990s, looking for rival bike clubs sporting the \u201cArizona\u201d rocker. Once they made contact, Mora would issue an ultimatum: \u201cI told them to lose the rocker. If they refused, we\u2019d cut it off their backs. If they obeyed, no problem. Let\u2019s have a beer.\u201d\n\nFor years, the Vagos in Bullhead City and other parts of Mohave County wore \u201cCalifornia\u201d rockers. That changed about two years ago, Severson says. \u201cThen they started sporting Arizona rockers, and that\u2019s when the problems started. That\u2019s more than likely what precipitated the fight in Bullhead City.\u201d Concurrently, the number of Vagos operating in Arizona climbed sharply. Not just in Bullhead City and Mohave County, where Severson currently counts \u201c15 or more.\u201d Also in Yavapai County. And in Phoenix.\n\nIt was clear to law enforcement that the Vagos \u2013 a rising MC with designs on Mexico and the Southwest \u2013 were making a push into Arizona. It seems likely that the Hells Angels noticed, too.\n\nPage Break\n\nThe issue of Arizona rockers was potentially a contributing factor in the Chino Valley gun battle. So was the curious proximity of the Vagos house to Toth\u2019s two-story stucco dwelling. Outlaw bikers are sensitive to affronts. The Hells Angels could not have been pleased by the symbolic violation of their turf. Asked to estimate the odds that a full-patch Vagos biker would move within three doorsteps of the old Skull Valley clubhouse and not know it, one Hells Angels says, \u201cNo chance at all.\u201d\n\nThe upshot: Neither side came to Chino Valley on August 21 to brawl, necessarily. But a brawl \u2013 somewhere, sometime \u2013 was all but inevitable.\n\nAccording to documents released by the Yavapai County Attorney\u2019s Office in September 2010, Vagos Tri-State vice president Aurelio Figueroa \u2013 who witnessed the shootout \u2013 had at least some inkling of the trouble to come. After the battle, he told a Sheriff\u2019s Office detective that he asked a group of Vagos from the Phoenix area not to attend the Chino Valley get-together, presumably to avoid a run-in with the Hells Angels, but that five of them came anyway.\n\nOn Friday night, the Vagos posted security details at the Diecks\u2019 house. After the shootout, authorities would confiscate a tidy arsenal of weaponry at the residence, including 10 handguns, one Norinco SKS rifle, two fighting knives and numerous boxes of ammunition.\n\nMoreover, Diecks told authorities that for several months leading up to the shooting, a Hells Angels prospect would ride past his house and \u201c[point] his fingers at him simulating a weapon,\u201d according to a news story that ran in the Chino Valley Review on September 15, 2010.\n\nThe volatile air-mixture of suspicion and tension almost certainly informed an incident Saturday morning when a group of three Hells Angels prospects \u2013 later identified as Scott, Bruce Schweigert and Robert Kittredge \u2013 crossed paths at a nearby Circle K with a pair of Vagos associates named Alfred Azevedo and Clay Messina. Yavapai County Superior Court documents show that Azevedo lived in Kingman at the time and was a \u201chang-around\u201d \u2013 that is, a Vagos gadfly with aspirations of becoming a prospect.\n\nAzevedo \u2013 whose version of the events figured prominently in a Sheriff\u2019s report \u2013 told investigators that one of the Hells Angels \u201capproached him and asked if he was a Vagos.\u201d That was the extent of the encounter \u2013 a surveillance video provided to authorities confirms that no physical confrontation occurred \u2013 but it evidently rattled Azevedo and Messina to the extent that a phone call was made to the Diecks residence alerting the Vagos to the effect that \u201cthe Hells Angels were trying to get them,\u201d according to the report.\n\nEvidently, the summons was taken to heart. Shortly after the phone call, a convoy of Vagos bikers left the Diecks residence and scrambled eastbound down Road 3 in Chino Valley toward the Circle K. Finding no Hells Angels, they continued westbound up Road 4, making a wide loop that would take them past the Hells Angels residence on their way back to the Vagos house.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when MC mayhem broke loose. According to a report filed by Detective Zavos, a Vagos biker named Bob Blankenship \u2013 who held the rank of Sergeant-of-Arms for the Tri-State Vagos \u2013 was shot as he executed a U-turn in front of the old Hells Angels clubhouse. The Vagos returned fire, wounding Hells Angel biker Kevin Christensen in the abdomen. (None of the five injuries from the battle was life-threatening.) The outnumbered Angels retreated into the house, where the firefight continued for approximately 10 minutes.\n\nThe Yavapai County Attorney\u2019s case against the Hell Angels chugged along in appeals court until May, when a sensational bit of information emerged about one of the key witnesses in the shootout. Alfred Azevedo, the Vagos hang-around who summoned the cavalry after the Circle K incident, was at the time also a confidential informant for GIITEM. And a scorned wannabe Hells Angel to boot.\n\nAccording to documents filed in Yavapai County Superior Court, Kingman-based GIITEM Detective John Morris started using Azevedo to spy on the Vagos in May 2010. As a \u201cpaid reliable informant,\u201d Azevedo had previously worked for law enforcement entities and was known to provide sound information about underworld dealings.\n\nPage Break\n\n\u201c[Azevedo] was hanging out at Bike Night quite a bit, which was a Wednesday night event in Kingman,\u201d Morris told defense attorneys in an hour-long interview. \u201cAnd he ended up running into one of the Vagos members that lived in Kingman, went to the guy\u2019s shop the next day, and within, I don\u2019t know, an hour\u2026 was invited to the international Vagos run in Parker. So that was pretty much how easy it was.\u201d As Azevedo\u2019s control officer, Morris was responsible for monitoring his activity and debriefing him. Consequently, the lawman was alarmed when word trickled up to Kingman about the gun battle in Chino Valley.\n\n\u201cI was worried about [Azevedo] being involved in the shooting,\u201d Morris recalls. Upon hearing the news, he jumped in his car and high-tailed it to the scene of the crime, alerting the lead detective, Zavos, that he had an informant embedded in the Vagos.\n\nPresumably to protect Azevedo\u2019s confidential status, Zavos never disclosed the nature of the hang-around\u2019s involvement with GIITEM during the initial grand jury evidentiary hearing in November. The facts only came to light in May after a court-ordered sheriff\u2019s office report. By that time, Azevedo was no longer useful as an informant, having helped Morris execute a Vagos-related fraud case in Kingman. In other words, his cover was blown. \u201c[The fraud case] pretty much let the cat out of the bag,\u201d Morris says.\n\nCiting ethical rules, both Yavapai County Attorney Dana Owens and defense counsel Gaxiola declined to comment on the Azevedo matter, but the presence of a GIITEM asset in the case does invite some second-guessing. In the wake of the shooting, law enforcement obviously sought to preserve their Vagos informant. Might that have skewed the case against the Hells Angels? And what about Azevedo\u2019s motives? According to Morris, Azevedo tried to \u201chang out with the Hells Angels\u201d in Kingman before courting the Vagos, but they \u201ckept kind of just shunning him.\u201d Was he bitter over the slight? Could he have lit the powder keg on Yuma Drive by misrepresenting the Circle K encounter?\n\nAs reflected in their police interviews, the Vagos maintain that the shootout was a premeditated event on the part of the Hells Angels. Justin Kaufman, a Vagos hang-around from Mesa who was driving his black Range Rover near the crime scene, told Sheriff\u2019s Office investigators that the Angels had been planning the attack \u201cfor a while.\u201d\n\nAll factors for a jury to weigh in trial, if a trial ever happens. As this issue went to press, the case was still mired in appeal and pre-trial litigation. A joint-motion to dismiss the charges against the Hells Angels was pending.\n\nWhatever the outcome in the Chino Valley case, Arizona will be left with the same uncertain outlaw-biker predicament: One large, entrenched biker brand, very well known to the public, and a smaller but fast-growing challenger, significantly less well known. And neither looks to back down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a definite upswing in biker numbers for all clubs,\u201d Sgt. Robbie Milam of GIITEM\u2019s Phoenix office says, citing the popularity of the biker-themed cable show The Sons of Anarchy as one explanation. \u201cThe Vagos got a foothold in Mohave County and now they\u2019re in Phoenix, and that indicates they\u2019re trying to make inroads.\u201d\n\nHow will the Hells Angels respond? What will happen the next time a group of guys wearing the death-head patch catches sight of a sea of muscular-Loki-green, or vice versa? With Valley-area chapters and clubhouses in Phoenix, Mesa and Cave Creek, the Angels maintain they\u2019re not the belligerent party. Officially, they say the Arizona rocker is a moot issue. \u201cWe don\u2019t enforce anything like that,\u201d Koepke says. \u201cThat\u2019s the old mentality. People are free to wear whatever patch they like.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement confirms that the Hells Angels appear to have loosened up their bottom rocker policy. Milam reports that members of the Mongols Motorcycle Club \u2013 another traditional Hells Angels enemy \u2013 have been sighted wearing the Arizona rocker in Mesa, and that two Hells Angels-affiliated clubs, the Hooligans and the Sons of Hell, recently began wearing the Arizona rocker with the Hells Angels\u2019 blessing.\n\n\u201cThat occurred in April, so we\u2019ll see if that\u2019s a change in philosophy on the Angels\u2019 part.\u201d Milam says.\n\nStill, Milam \u2013 whose declined to estimate the number of Vagos operating in greater Phoenix, other than to say \u201csignificant\u201d \u2013 predicts that Chino Valley is just the tip of the iceberg: \u201cThere\u2019s still gonna be a turf battle regardless of who wears what.\u201d\n\nFor the Arizona Hells Angels, the changing outlaw-biker landscape presents an age-old dilemma for powerful men and alpha-dominant organizations, of dynasties stretching from ancient Rome to Michael Jordan\u2019s Chicago Bulls \u2013 i.e., the challenge of holding the center. Of staying on top.\n\nHow the Hells Angels choose to handle the dilemma may well determine how close the turf battle comes to the Valley\u2019s doorstep. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough predicament,\u201d one longtime member concedes. \u201cWe\u2019re the only ones with anything to lose in this whole shebang.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://themobmuseum.org/blog/three-charged-in-hells-angels-shooting-of-rival-vagos-riders-during-memorial-day-weekend/", "page_content": "Richard Devries, Russell Smith and Stephen Alo were arrested in the shooting of six members of the Vagos motorcycle gang in Henderson, Nevada. Devries is president of the Las Vegas chapter of the Hells Angels.\n\nIt was supposed to be a peaceful motorcycle ride near Hoover Dam in honor of America\u2019s war dead, followed by a trip to a veterans cemetery in Boulder City, Nevada.\n\nMembers of the Vagos, an outlaw motorcycle gang with a history of violence, were clustered together driving on U.S. 95 in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson on Sunday, May 29, when three men affiliated with the rival, equally violent Hells Angels gang followed them on their bikes and then fired shots, injuring six Vagos.\n\nThe attack happened after three men, a mix of current and prospective Hells Angels, trailed the Vagos who were riding as part of the Flags Over Dam motorcycle event that morning outside Hoover Dam and on to the Veterans Memorial Cemetery, where people gathered in tribute to fallen members of the U.S. military during the Memorial Day weekend.\n\nAuthorities have not yet released, or determined, what triggered the one-sided shooting. The Vagos apparently did not fire any shots before or during the assault.\n\nThree suspects, Richard Devries, 66, Stephen Alo, 46, and Russell Smith, 26, were arrested and charged with attempted murder, murder conspiracy, battery with a deadly weapon and discharging a firearm into a vehicle.\n\nDevries is president of the Las Vegas chapter of the Hells Angels.\n\nThe exterior of the Hells Angels clubhouse in Las Vegas, near Bonanza Road and 15th Street. Courtesy of Flickr.\n\nHELLS ANGELS MAY HAVE TAKEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE\n\nSteve Cook, a motorcycle gang expert and executive director of the Midwest Outlaw Motorcycle Gang Investigators Association, based in Kansas City, Missouri, said the Hells Angels and Vagos have had a longstanding violent feud and the Angels in this case may have decided, \u201cwe have an opportunity here, let\u2019s take it.\u201d\n\nSteve Cook, an expert on outlaw motorcycle gangs, suspects the Vagos will retaliate for the shooting of six of its members outside Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cThe Angels are the Rolls-Royce of outlaw motorcycle gangs,\u201d Cook said. \u201cEveryone wants to be them, but everyone hates them. They\u2019re wealthy, they have legend status with the public.\u201d\n\nLately, Cook said, the well-known biker gang has had to battle not only the Vagos, but other top motorcycle gangs such as the Mongols and Pagans \u201con both coasts\u201d and the Outlaws, who \u201care a big problem for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Angels are getting pushed around a lot, especially out in Nevada,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are basically fighting on a number of fronts. They are fighting a majority of the biker gangs in the country. The other gangs look at them, and say, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s go after them.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn this case, Cook said the group of Angels may have not expected to see the Vagos on Memorial Day weekend, but \u201cthey operate in [a] thought process that can be violent. \u2026You\u2019ve also got to be in an offensive position, especially in a competitive place like Las Vegas.\u201d\n\nThe casual use of methamphetamine, a common drug among biker gangs, may also have affected their judgment, Cook said.\n\nA possible rationalization in their minds to go through with the violent altercation is the belief that witnesses might be too squeamish to testify and \u201cthe prosecution\u2019s case will collapse anyway,\u201d he said.\n\nPROSPECTIVE MEMBERS RODE WITH HELLS ANGELS\n\nAccording to Henderson Police, the morning of the shooting, five prospects seeking admission as members to the Hells Angels pursued the group of Vagos to the veterans cemetery in Boulder City. The gang candidates began to cause problems, unspecified by police, for the Vagos inside the confines of the cemetery.\n\nThe prospects then motored out of the cemetery 15 to 20 minutes before the Vagos left to drive toward Henderson. The Vagos cruised side by side northbound in the first lane of U.S. 95 near Wagon Wheel Drive. After the Vagos passed Wagon Wheel, a number of Hells Angels members and prospects were seen approaching in lanes three and two as the Vagos riders remained in lane one.\n\nThe Hells Angels members and prospects drove up to the Vagos and started to kick them, attempting to knock them down onto the freeway. Then one of the Hells Angels allegedly stood up on his cycle, pulled a gun and opened fire on one of the Vagos riders, later identified as Alejandro Castillo. After firing, the Hells Angels gunman drove off northbound on U.S. 95. Nevada State Police received a call about the shooting at 11:50 a.m.\n\nOther Vagos injured in the gunplay included Ricardo Velasquez, Carie Chapin, Michael Stasiewicz, Michael Lempart and Chad Merrill. All were transported to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas. In their condition, the victims were only able to provide limited information to detectives.\n\nPolice officers picked up a number of empty shell casings from the northbound roadway, between the College Drive and Horizon Drive exit ramps.\n\nJust before the gunfire, an anonymous witness heading north on U.S. 95 phoned 911 to report seeing a number of Hells Angels parked on the side of the freeway looking as if they were waiting.\n\nThe witness took a video showing a fully patched Hells Angels member and three gang prospects riding alongside the Vagos members. One of the prospects, on a black motorcycle, wore only the bottom half of a gang logo patch, with red lining at the bottom of the vest, and tan pants and red shoes. The rider\u2019s arms were covered in tattoos and he was holding his left arm down with an \u201citem\u201d in his hand, police reported. The rider passed the witness, rode toward an additional motorcyclist and then the witness heard the gunshots.\n\nBoulder City Police soon learned that several Hells Angels had been inside the Coffee Cup caf\u00e9 in Boulder City before the shooting. A Las Vegas Metropolitan Police intelligence detective and a sergeant arrived at the caf\u00e9 and viewed surveillance footage showing four Hells Angels associates there about 9 a.m.\n\nMetro intelligence officers recognized one of them as Richard \u201cRizzo\u201d Devries, Las Vegas chapter president. With Devries was Stephen Alo, a prospective member who was wearing a black vest with a red lining on the bottom and no sleeves, plus tan pants and red shoes and his arms fully tattooed. Also present were two other prospects, Aaron Chun, wearing a black vest and dark pants, and Russell Smith, who had on a black vest with black sleeves, black pants and white Nike shoes.\n\nFrom the surveillance video at the caf\u00e9 and the witness\u2019s video from the freeway, police identified Smith as the male with the tattoos on both arms, wearing a black vest, tan pants, red shoes and a white helmet who held something in his left arm. Metro intelligence detectives recognized the Hells Angels man with the fully patched vest, riding a black motorcycle, as Devries.\n\nThe detectives viewing Boulder City Police dashboard video saw some suspected Hells Angels riding westbound on U.S. 93 leaving Boulder City before the call about the shooting. A detective identified Devries, Alo and Smith on the video. Devries rode first, followed by Smith and Alo riding together.\n\nLater that evening, Metro detectives wrote search warrants for Devries, Alo and Smith and confirmed their home addresses. Henderson and Las Vegas police watched Alo leave his home.\n\nLas Vegas intelligence detectives traced Alo\u2019s mobile phone to a cell signal site in the area of U.S. 95 and College Drive near the time of the gunshots. Cell sites also placed Smith\u2019s mobile phone in the area of U.S. 95 and the I-215 freeway north of the shooting location, just after the shots were fired, and earlier at the Coffee Cup caf\u00e9.\n\nHenderson Police arrested and booked the three men early Monday on six counts each of alleged attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, battery with a deadly weapon and discharge of a firearm into a vehicle. On Tuesday, they were formally charged. Police added gang enhancements against Devries, which could mean more years in prison if he is found guilty.\n\nThe prospects riding with Devries likely were those asked to join the Angels gang and served a preliminary \u201chang around\u201d designation \u2013 fulfilling mundane chores such as guarding bikes outside a bar \u2013 for about six months, and then might receive a rectangular bottom partial \u201crocker\u201d Angels patch to wear on their riding vest, Cook said.\n\nAfter the prospect serves about a year with the gang, the Angels chapter decides if the person has the qualities to become a member, and takes a vote on him joining. If the person wins, the gang awards him the top rocket vest patch, reading \u201cHells Angels,\u201d the gang\u2019s signature death\u2019s head symbol in the center and the name of their state on the bottom, and perhaps a rocket patch of the side naming their city of membership.\n\nCook said he believes \u201cthere will be retaliation by the Vagos\u201d against the Hells Angels over the Henderson shooting.\n\nHUNDREDS OF OUTLAW MOTORCYCLE GANGS\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department as of 2021 logged more than 300 outlaw motorcycle gangs (OMG) across the county, \u201cranging in size from single chapters with five or six members to hundreds of chapters with thousands of members worldwide,\u201d according to the agency\u2019s website.\n\nThe leading gangs mentioned by the department include the Hells Angels, Vagos, Mongols, Bandidos, Outlaws, Sons of Silence, Black Pistons and Pagans.\n\nMost of the criminal acts committed by OMGs include drug smuggling, in particular across the U.S.-Mexico border, in conspiracies with major international drug trafficking organizations.\n\nThe Hells Angels, formed in San Bernardino California, in 1948, have at least 800 members in 92 chapters in 27 states, according to the Justice Department. The gang\u2019s illegal activities include trafficking marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine, hashish, heroin, LSD and ecstasy, and committing assaults, extortion, murders, money laundering and motorcycle theft.\n\nJustice did not mention Hells Angels chapters located outside the United States. The gang\u2019s own website claims to have 467 chapters in 59 countries on five continents.\n\nThe Vagos outlaw motorcycle gang was founded in San Bernardino, California, in 1965.\n\nThe Vagos, started in 1965 in San Bernardino, maintains about 300 members in California, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon and Mexico, the Justice Department estimated. The gang is known to produce and distribute methamphetamine, sell illegal marijuana and engage in assaults, extortion, insurance fraud, money laundering, vehicle theft, witness intimidation and weapons violations.\n\nSeveral decades ago, the American Motorcyclist Association asserted that less than one percent of motorcyclists belong to outlaw motorcycle gangs. The outlaw clubs subsequently embraced this phrase, describing themselves as \u201cone percenters.\u201d\n\nThe Hells Angels and Vagos have participated in many shootings with opposing gangs over the years.\n\nIn September 2011, Vagos member Ernesto Gonzalez shot Jeffrey Pettigrew, president of the Hells Angels chapter in San Jose, California, four times in the back during a brawl on a dance floor at John Ascuaga\u2019s Nugget hotel-casino in Sparks, Nevada. The next day in Sparks, two Vagos members were shot and wounded.\n\nIn a major legal case against the Vagos, including the 2011 Nugget casino killing, federal prosecutors in Las Vegas charged eight members with violations under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, including murder, drug dealing, robbery, extortion and kidnapping. The crimes were allegedly committed in California, Nevada and four other states going back to 2005. However, the case foundered and a judge dismissed the charges in 2020.\n\nIn 2002, Laughlin, Nevada, was the setting for a biker gang shootout involving the Hells Angels and Mongols. Two Hells Angels were shot to death, and one Mongol was stabbed to death. Six Hells Angels and six Mongols went to prison stemming from the confrontation."}]}
