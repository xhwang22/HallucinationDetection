He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.

He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/5105150/ex-celtic-duncan-mackay-died-82/", "page_content": "FORMER Celtic player Duncan MacKay has passed away aged 82.\n\nThe former right-back made 236 appearances in green and white after making his Hoops first-team debut in 1958.\n\n1 Celtic have confirmed former player Duncan MacKay has died Credit: PA:Press Association\n\nMacKay, who had came through the ranks, went on to establish himself as a first-team player.\n\nHe was made club captain in 1961 before handing over the armband to Celts legend Billy McNeill in 1963.\n\nCeltic confirmed the news in a statement, writing: \"Everyone at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\n\"Dunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.\n\n\"His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\n\"A highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\n\"He would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\n\"In November 1964, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland.

And while a member of those bands, at the same time he remained one of the most in-demand session musicians, participating in recordings by The Alan Parsons Project, Kate Bush, Camel, Budgie , and others. As unbelievable as it is, all three of these musicians are one and the same.\n\nThe man in question? The understated legend Duncan Mackay .\n\nNot only does Mackay\u2019s story incorporate that of the \u201cthree musicians,\u201d but he also moved to become an accomplished composer, delving into library music and soundtracking. And after focusing on composing for several years, Mackay decided to harken back to his progressive roots through a liaison with the Japanese label, Belle Antique.\n\nThat particular rabbit hole led Mackay to the most recent and exciting footnote in his celebrated career, Fluance , a band that\u2019s pitched a fresh take on a familiar sound, and one which both challenges and comforts the listener in one fell swoop.\n\nFluance is set to release their second album shortly, but in the meantime, you can get your fix listening to their first release, Lunacy.\n\nOne fine afternoon, from his home studio in South Africa, Mackay took the time to sit down with me via Zoom for an exclusive, career-spanning chat.\n\nJoe:\n\nFrom what I understand you initially studied violin in school. What drew you to focus more on the organ, keyboards, and other key-based instruments?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWell, I was very fortunate that my late father was a fabulous musician. He was a great violinist which is why the violin was the instrument that I went and did my music degree for. When I was at university, it was obligatory that your second instrument was keyboard based. I chose to do church organ as my second instrument. It was absolutely great. That\u2019s where I really honed my bass pedal playing. It was quite good at one time in my life. When I got my degree, I taught music for six months and realized that that was not what I wanted to do in my life. I just started playing around with keyboards, and I managed to get my first Hammond organ.\n\nThe way I was playing at that time was more from the jazz side. Jimmy Smith type Jazz, rather than traditional Jazz. I started getting noticed playing organ in that nontraditional Jazz style. In fact, that\u2019s how I ended up in Brazil at the age of 20. That all started when I met a fabulous guitarist by the name of Rosinha de Valen\u00e7a. She was in town playing with her band, but she also played with Sergio Mendes. She and I got on, and to cut the story short, their keyboard player had other things to do with his life. So, she said, \u201cWould you like to come to Rio de Janeiro and play with the rest of the chaps?\u201d I quickly resigned from my teaching job, and I was on the next plane to Brazil.\n\nJoe:\n\nSpeaking of your experience in Brazil, what effect did playing in the Sergio Mendes Band have on you as a young musician?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI think the experiences, as can happen when you\u2019re younger, are a natural chain of events that come about through a combination of chance and skill. I took it on board, and I got on with it. When I got a little older and was able to look back, I realized that was actually very important. At the time, it was just an adventure. Going to Rio. Holy shit, what a great place. Musically, I really learned rhythms from those guys. They were fantastic with rhythm. Rhythm is so important in music from Brazil.\n\nJoe:\n\nHow did the experience come to an end?\n\nDuncan:\n\nA chain of events led to the end of that experience. I can tell you I was lock-stock-and-barrel when I went over there. I shipped my prized possession, my Hammond organ, over to Rio. Unfortunately, some corruption in customs gave me trouble. Someone decided they liked my Hammond, and they didn\u2019t want to let it out of customs. I said, \u201cWell, send it back.\u201d They said, \u201cNo, no, no. You can\u2019t send it back unless you leave with it.\u201d So, wrongly, or rightly, I left with my Hammond, which was my most important possession at that age. I think I was over there for six months. It was a great time in my life.\n\nJoe:\n\nHow did you get into the prog rock scene?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI came back to South Africa by which time I\u2019d become aware of Keith Emerson. I think he was playing with The Nice in those days. What he was doing fit in with everything that I was writing. Keith was a big inspiration for the way I played in my early days. I love what he got up to. He was the first keyboard showman. There were plenty of guitarists chucking their guitars around, standing on monitors, a smashing up Marshall speakers. Normally, the keyboard player was somewhere in the background. Emerson stepped out and said, \u201cI\u2019m not doing that.\u201d I loved him for it, and of course, he was an extraordinary player.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nWhat sort of influence did Keith Emerson have on your playing and musical direction of your first solo album, Chimera?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI have always strived to be original in my career. Of course, you can\u2019t help but be influenced by outside things. Emerson was a big influence, and I enjoyed what he got up to for a lot of reasons. Back then \u2013 we\u2019re talking early 70s \u2013 there was one great thing about the music world. If your technique, playing, and imagination were bigger than the next guy, you were more likely to get the job. If you were also a good player and you practiced hard, then you could start going towards the virtuosity that Emerson had.\n\nJoe:\n\nThe attributes you mentioned: imagination, technique, and originality, were on full display on Chimera. Tell us about how the album came together.\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt was a massive stepping-stone. At that time, I was playing a multitude of keyboards, which included playing bass pedals with my feet. I was working with a fabulous drummer called Mike Gray. We were playing in a club several nights a week. Then we were offered an album deal. All of that meant that we were packing up all the gear every morning, at the club, and putting it in my van. Then we would drive into the recording studio, unload it, and record all day. Afterward, we would pack it up and put it back in the van. Then drive back to the club, set up all the gear, and play all night. Recording-wise, that was almost live. The whole album, the basic tracks anyway, were done in three days. That is unheard of nowadays. There were a couple of overdubs over a couple of days. We went in to sing a bit and do a few other things as well. But that was pretty much it. I look back at it now and wonder how the bloody hell that happened. [Laughs]. At the time, my knowledge of what was meant to happen in the studio was zero. It wasn\u2019t extraordinary, it was simply what we did. The whole process was part of what made the Chimera album special. Recording those songs all day and playing them every night.\n\nJoe:\n\nWhat part, if any, did Chimera have on enabling you to garner the amount of work you would come into shortly following its release?\n\nDuncan:\n\nSo, the club where we played was called The Branch Office. It instantly became a hub for other musicians. It was the only club around that didn\u2019t have a dance floor. People just came and sat and listened. When all the other musicians playing in other clubs finished playing at midnight, they would come over. It always turned into a jam session. It was very good times. One of the chaps who was visiting at the time was Peter Knight Jr. He was the head of Phonogram International. I felt I was coming to the end of the club thing. We hit the highs there. My plan was always to return to England. A couple of weeks later, I got a call from Peter, and said, \u201cGinger Baker and Adrian Gurvitz are starting a new band. They\u2019ve heard Chimera. I\u2019ve told them how you play. Would you like to join?\u201d I was a fan of Cream, and Ginger Baker was a hero of mine. Ginger was right up there, blimey. I got the call on a Saturday morning, and that same night I got on a plane to England. I showed up there and I started with Ginger Baker and Adrian Gurvitz. I believe the group was to be called The Baker-Gurvitz Army. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work out. I\u2019ve met a lot of people in the music business. All types and levels of importance. Ginger Baker is right up there with one of the most unpleasant people I\u2019ve ever met. [Laughs].\n\nJoe:\n\nAt that point, you stayed in England to look for a gig that was a better fit, right? What led you to join Cockney Rebel?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI went to Peter Knight Jr., with who I\u2019d become friends, and was now back in London. I went to him, and I said, \u201cLook, I appreciate everything, but I can\u2019t do this.\u201d It was a difficult decision, but Peter was very helpful. I looked around and ended up meeting two great chaps. Jon Hiseman, from Colosseum , and Gary Moore, the guitarist. They were starting a band called Colosseum II. After I met them, I started rehearsing with them. It was fantastic. Nice people. Unbelievable players. But they were broke and didn\u2019t have any record company support. I was broke too, like most musicians, and needed a paying gig. Suddenly, the Cockney Rebel gig was offered to me. Initially, I auditioned with Steve Harley, and I didn\u2019t get the gig. Then, for some reason, I got called back for a second audition. By this time Jim Cregan was the guitarist in the band, and Jim said to Harley, \u201cYou got to get this guy,\u201d and I joined Cockney Rebel.\n\nJoe:\n\nCockney Rebel had some decent success and exposure in the U.K., including a number one hit. Why do you feel the band wasn\u2019t able to duplicate that same feat in The States?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI don\u2019t know. We did a tour of the states, which I enjoyed immensely. During the tour, we were supported by The Kinks. It all seemed to go down well. I wish I had a more definitive answer. Back then the business side of music wasn\u2019t at the forefront of my mind. I was playing music with a bunch of great guys and having fun. The politics and that side of music hadn\u2019t gotten their hooks into me yet. I look back on those times, by the way, Joe, with happiness. The business side of music isn\u2019t always something to be proud of. I understand it\u2019s got to be there, but it\u2019s got very little to do with actual music.\n\nAt that time, at least, the record companies were more apt to recognize a band for what it was and where it can progress to. It was not uncommon for a band to sign a three or four-album deal. The idea was the power of the record company would help the artist financially to make those three or four albums. Help them grow. That doesn\u2019t happen anymore.\n\nHowever, going back to your question, I don\u2019t think Steve [Harley] helped himself with his attitude. He was very arrogant and abrasive, which he got away with in the U.K. In hindsight, I think that had something to do with it. When he decided that he didn\u2019t need Cockney Rebel anymore, which was an enormous mistake, I stayed on as his right-hand man. He [Steve Harley] never did crack America, as you know.\n\nImage credit: Dick Barnatt/Redferns\n\nJoe:\n\nIt seemed like Cockney Rebel was getting stronger with each album. Can you provide any insight into the sequence of events that led to the eventual disbanding?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWhen we made that first album with \u201cMake Me Smile (Come Up and See Me),\u201d there was no doubt that Jim Cregan and I were very much part of the writing team. It became very apparent that Steve wasn\u2019t at all prepared to acknowledge that in terms of songwriting credits. Any future would have just been, \u201cHere\u2019s some money come and play,\u201d or \u201cCan I use your knowledge and expertise to make my next song?\u201d We all got a bit fed up with it. Jim left first and went off to join Rod Stewart.\n\nJoe:\n\nThat\u2019s kind of similar to what happened with the first iteration of the band.\n\nDuncan:\n\nThat\u2019s right. Steve Harley has done it all his life. The proof of what we\u2019re talking about is in the result. Since the Cockney Rebel that I was in, since we all stopped working together, there hasn\u2019t been a hit. It\u2019s really silly. I\u2019d personally rather have 50% of something than 100% of nothing.\n\nJoe:\n\nA handful of years ago you took part in a Cockney Rebel anniversary tour with most of the classic lineup intact. What was the impetus for that tour?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWell, that was Steve\u2019s [Harley] idea. I have been in some contact with Jim [Cregan] and Stuart Elliot, the original drummer, over the years. Stuart and I are good friends. When we talked about putting together a reunion to celebrate The Best Years of Our Lives, I thought, \u201cThat will be great fun to relive the camaraderie that we had in those beginning years.\u201d The band was all good mates. It was fabulous. So, I agreed to do it. I went back over to the U.K. for the tour. I enjoyed working with Jim, Stuart, and Steve\u2019s bass player at the time was a guy called Marty Prior. He toured with us and is also the bass player in Fluance. I ended up meeting all the other people from Fluance through Marty.\n\nJoe:\n\nWhat was the experience like of working with that group of guys again after all those years?\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt was terrific to play those old songs, but the tour ended up being all about Steve. Steve was still the prima donna that he always was, but now to an even greater extent. That\u2019s me being very polite. Despite all that, we had a great time. We did 23 dates, or something like that, and played to 3000 people a night. It was fabulous and very humbling to see people of our age coming to revisit their youth. It was amazing to see how important Rebel and those songs had been in their lives. I\u2019ve got goosebumps just thinking about it. I enjoyed that part of it a lot.\n\nJoe:\n\nYour second solo album, Score had some notable differences from Chimera. The psychedelic nature and frenetic pace of Chimera were replaced with jazzier sounds and a more melodic tempo. How did working with Steve Harley, and John Wetton\u2019s production inform your approach?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI think you hit the nail on the head with everything you said. I was now living in the U.K. and had different influences. And that\u2019s the way the record went. EMI was a big company and there were elements added to try to make it more accessible than Chimera. But there never has been a set plan going into an album. It\u2019s gonna go the way it goes naturally as I start writing. I mean, there\u2019s a fake plan, of course. [Laughs]. That\u2019s the lovely thing about going into the studio, you can go in the morning thinking, \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d and then you start fiddling around with this sound and that sound. You don\u2019t go in a completely different direction, but certainly with a different flavor. I love that, especially when mistakes in the studio stay on the record. Sometimes those mistakes are bloody brilliant. I find getting it clinically correct, which an awful lot of music is today, somehow sucks the soul out of it.\n\nJoe:\n\nOne of the most exciting opportunities you had was working with The Alan Parsons Project on three of their albums towards the beginning of their career. You first met Alan as a producer for Cockyney Rebel, right? What was that experience like and what did you take away from it?\n\nDuncan:\n\nThat\u2019s correct. So, there was Alan and Andrew Powell, who was Alan Parsons\u2019s orchestrator. He was a great classical orchestrator. I first met them while recording with Rebel. I got on really well with Alan Parsons. I learned so much from that man through his approach in the studio. He invited me and Stuart Elliott, the drummer from Cockney Rebel, as well as Ian Bairnson and David Paton from Pilot to record on several projects. The four of us became the nucleus for an awful lot of other people\u2019s records. If the four of us had been in a band together, it would have worked because we played well together. It wasn\u2019t the same as getting your average four-session guys to come and play drums, bass, guitar, and keyboards. Events unfolded and we just ended up doing the Parsons album. Then Andrew Powell got the job producing the first Kate Bush album and the same four chaps got pulled in to do that album. We became a team. When we weren\u2019t working with either rebel or pilot, and we had time down, then people would normally knock on the door. They would say, \u201cCan you guys come be the band for our album?\u201d It was all great fun, especially the Parsons Project. It [The Alan Parsons Project] was always innovative and adventurous.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nYou started to mention Kate Bush. What was it like to work with her at the beginning of her career?\n\nDuncan:\n\nKate was fantastic and delightful. She was unbelievably humble and sweet. She was extremely talented. I loved her songs, writing, and piano playing. She played a great piano. When we went to record Kate\u2019s first album, we all turned up, the four of us [Duncan Mackay, Stuart Elliott, Ian Bairnson, and David Paton]. We hadn\u2019t seen each other for a little while and we had gotten there early. So, we were chatting and catching up. That\u2019s when a funny little incident happened that describes Kate to a tee. This young lady comes into where we are sitting and says, \u201cWould anybody like a cup of tea?\u201d We all said, \u201cYes, thank you very much. That\u2019d be lovely.\u201d Off she went to get us our tea, and then Andrew Powell turned up. He was a bit late. When he came in, what we thought was the tea girl was beside him. He said, \u201cHave you met Kate yet?\u201d [Laughs]. Then we got to work.\n\nJoe:\n\nBy Kate\u2019s third album, Never For Ever, the studio nucleus surrounding the first two albums was mostly not involved. However, you stayed on to work with her on the album for a few tracks. What led to the change in personnel?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI may be wrong, but I think Stuart Elliott was also there. There were other people around that I didn\u2019t know so well. But Joe, that wasn\u2019t such a big deal, I thought \u201cOkay, there are other people around and that was fine.\u201d Around that time, she started to play live, and different people were part of her live outfit. It made sense to include those people in the studio. It was just a chain of events.\n\nJoe:\n\nDavid Gilmore had a role as an executive producer on Kate Bush\u2019s first album, The Kick Inside. Did you ever work with him in any capacity in the studio during the album?\n\nDuncan:\n\nNot so much, Joe. As far as I remember, heads would pop in, and people would talk, etc., but I don\u2019t remember specifically dealing with him. I know the story about how Kate got the EMI deal in the first place, which was through him. He\u2019d heard her somewhere and knew she was one to watch. And boy, was he right. But his involvement in the album, if my memory serves me right, wasn\u2019t enormous. Maybe behind the scenes, it was enormous.\n\nJoe:\n\nAnother band that, like Cockney Rebel, was going through a transitionary period when you joined was 10cc. How did it compare to when you joined Cockney Rebel?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI\u2019ve been very fortunate in both bands I\u2019ve been a member of. Fortunate because the chaps in the band we\u2019re good guys, which is unbelievably vital to any band. It is certainly vital to any band I want to be with. When I was with Rebel, we worked very hard, and we played hard. It was a very good time to be in the game. I had much the same experience with 10cc. 10cc had a different approach in that it was run like the military without the strict bit and certainly not the haircuts. [Laughs]. When we said 9 am in the studio to record, that meant 9 am. Musically, it was fantastic because everybody was always experimenting with different approaches and styles. The live shows were always fantastic with that band, and we were renowned for always having a very good sound. That\u2019s because of the time, the effort, and the thought that went into getting that level of sound. Our sound engineer, who mixed the live sound, was treated almost like a member of the band. That\u2019s how important he was to us. It all just worked well. Great players, great music. I was so fortunate that both bands I joined, Cockney Rebel and 10cc, had hits that went to number one with \u201cCome Up and See Me,\u201d and \u201cDreadlock Holiday.\u201d\n\nJoe:\n\nWas there anything in particular that pulled 10cc towards the ska and reggae sounds that were incorporated on both \u201cDreadlock Holiday\u201d and other songs on Bloody Tourists?\n\nDuncan:\n\nThe reason that I enjoyed 10cc from day one was the way the music would evolve and transpire. We never sat down and said, \u201cHey, let\u2019s do a reggae song, or let\u2019s specifically take the direction we did end up taking on \u2018Dreadlock Holiday.\u2019\u201d As far as I remember, it was just, we\u2019re going to do a song, and this is how it\u2019s progressing. It wasn\u2019t a whole preconceived idea. I don\u2019t think Eric [Stewart] and Graham [Gouldman] expected it to ever become the monster hit it turned into. I think the enormous success of that track took us all by surprise, at least a little bit.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nLet\u2019s backtrack for a minute and discuss how you ended up becoming a member of 10cc in the first place.\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt was New Year\u2019s Eve, and a mate of mine was throwing a party. This mate was a rather famous photographer. He used to throw a party every year to thank all the models, agencies, and other people he worked with. He asked, \u201cDo you want to put together a little scratch band and come play the New Year party?\u201d I went, \u201cYeah, why not?\u201d I remember lugging my Hammond up the stairs and helping set everything up. We started playing and one of the chaps who turned up was Rick Fenn, the guitarist from 10cc. We had a spare amp and Rick plugged in and jammed with us. We had great fun and eventually said our goodbyes. Later on, the next week, he phoned up and said, \u201cDo you want to come meet the band? I\u2019m in 10cc. We\u2019re looking for a keyboard player.\u201d I hit it off with the guys in the band. They had just started recording the Bloody Tourist album. I was able to slot in rather nicely, right at the beginning of that album. That\u2019s how that happened. It was a shame it didn\u2019t carry on longer.\n\nJoe:\n\nWhat were the circumstances that led to you parting ways with 10cc sometime after Look Here?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWe were in the middle of a world tour. We had just come back from America, and we had Christmas off. We had two weeks and then we were on our way to Australia and Japan. In that interim Eric [Stewart] had a terrible car crash on black ice. The car crash turned into a disaster for the band as Eric was injured quite badly. Some decisions were made by management that were silly. Then we did the Look Here? album, which was a very different experience from making Bloody Tourists. Things seemed to diminish from there to a point where I had to make the hard decision to move on.\n\nJoe:\n\nI wanted to touch on Budgie. I\u2019d say that Budgie was very different from many other artists you had worked with to that point. While Budgie had begun to experiment with various sounds, Deliver Us From Evil was certainly a divergence for the band. Where was the band both creatively and musically at the time, and what were the circumstances that led to you being involved in the album?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI don\u2019t know definitively, but I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019d heard some of my other work. Based on what they heard, they thought that I could help in with the direction they were looking to go in. My knowledge of them as a band, before I turned up in the studio, was limited. I knew of them, but I hadn\u2019t heard lots of their music. I had no idea what I was turning up for. In many ways, that aspect was no different from many of the other experiences I have had. People wanted me to play with them because of my style, which was a lot different than many of my contemporaries. Whatever I brought to the party, it was what they were looking for.\n\nJoe:\n\nWere you given full creative control over the keyboard parts, or were you considered more of a hired gun?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI have never been the hired gun, ever. It\u2019s not me being arrogant but simply the way my career has gone. People would ask me to play on an album because they liked how I played. I can only say this in hindsight but there really were no expectations. I was booked to do an album in this residential studio with Budgie. I turned up and it was great. I got to meet some nice guys and play some music. That\u2019s kind of how I went into it.\n\nJoe:\n\nGiven this was Budgie\u2019s first album to significantly feature the keyboards, what were the expectations set forth going into the studio?\n\nDuncan:\n\nYou should also understand that there are things I turned down. I remember one band, who I won\u2019t mention, had their management phone me up. They said, \u201cWe\u2019re looking for someone who plays piano like Jerry Lee Lewis.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, don\u2019t speak to me because I don\u2019t play anything like that. It\u2019s not how I play. So, thank you, but no thank you.\u201d I play how I play, and it seems to have worked rather well.\n\nJoe:\n\nIn the 70s through the early 80s, you were on a torrid recording pace. How did you find the time to record your solo music while also being a member of Cockney Rebel, as well as 10cc, and work as a session musician?\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt was my extreme, complete, and dedicated focus on playing and making music. I loved every second of it. None of it seemed like work. It was all, \u201cYeah, brilliant. Fancy that. Let\u2019s have a go.\u201d The timing of it all played into it as well. It was a different era in rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, progressive music, or whatever you want to call it. It was more adventurous, and people were taking a lot more risks than they do now. That all benefited me as a musician. I\u2019m delighted that I was able to work so extensively during that era and for it to have brought forth so many highlights from my career. It was an era where the music business seemed to be run more by music than business. I\u2019m sure that may not fully be an accurate statement, but those are my feelings regarding the music business. I\u2019m not moaning. It\u2019s changed. The world changed. Life changed. It is what it is.\n\nJoe:\n\nIt\u2019s certainly important to touch on Visa. I see it as a nod to much of your later work in library music and soundtracks. You mentioned that much of your music tends to develop organically in the studio, however, what inspired you to take the direction you developed on Visa?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI know what I said earlier about how I record but, Visa was the exception. I\u2019ve always been a tunesmith. Tunes have always just come to me. I love a good tune and that is probably based on my classical training. Mozart and Beethoven wrote great tunes and that\u2019s why we still know them hundreds of years later. In the Chimera days and subsequent albums, virtuosity was part of the writing thing there. When I did Visa, I thought, \u201cLet\u2019s explore this being a tunesmith idea, but keep some technique and a put bit of flash in it.\u201d Plus, I had just recently acquired some sequencers and other new equipment. It was an experiment and probably a bit more contrived than some of my other works. It was a different direction for sure. I had built my first ever studio and that was my first attempt at recording there. That was the path that Visa went down. It was an experiment, and it was exciting.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nWith Greg McEwan Kocovaos, you recorded The First Time. The two of you were seamlessly able to blend new wave/art rock sounds with more modern electronic and world music flavors. I was able to listen to the album on SoundCloud, but not much else is out there about the album.\n\nDuncan:\n\nTo tell you the truth, I had no idea it was available anywhere. [Laughs]. It was a great plan, but it didn\u2019t work out. If you want to work with me, committing to something is a prerequisite lesson. If I\u2019m going to put all my energy into something, I expect it from the other people I\u2019m working with as well. In my book, it\u2019s not too much to expect. It\u2019s a prerequisite for making good music and getting it somewhere. It didn\u2019t work out and it was a shame. The way it was going, it became obvious to me towards the end of making the album that it wasn\u2019t going to work out. So, I made the album and moved on. This has happened to me a few times. I\u2019ve gone down a path with someone who has said all the right words at the beginning about commitment and didn\u2019t follow through.\n\nYou know, people say musicians just go on stage and they work for two hours a day, \u201cLucky them.\u201d All the good musicians do much more. They just live it. You need to say, \u201cLook, I have no idea if this is gonna be successful. I have no idea if it\u2019s gonna make a dollar or a million dollars. But I\u2019m going into it with 100%.\u201d Otherwise, why bother? That\u2019s been my attitude to this game all my life. That happened with Greg, and it unfortunately also happened with the Bletchley Park Project. The projects that didn\u2019t work out always cause me to look back on my time with both Rebel and 10 CC with gratitude. Gratitude because all the people in those bands were so like-minded about what we were up to, and generally good chaps. That is vital for me. I can\u2019t work with someone who I haven\u2019t got any respect. I don\u2019t care how talented they are. Is the plan to be heart-and-soul 100%? Then off we go. That\u2019s the truth. Thank you for even knowing about it.\n\nJoe:\n\nYou mentioned the Bletchley Park Project. I wanted to discuss both that album and Kintsugi. What made you return to your 70s prog rock-styled musical approach, and how did you end up on the Japanese label, Belle Antique?\n\nDuncan:\n\nHow that came about was out of the blue. I got a request from a Japanese prog magazine to do an interview. My interview was featured in this magazine, and soon after I got a call from Belle Antique Records. They said, \u201cWould you be interested in doing a prog album.\u201d I\u2019ve done a lot of commercial things, as we\u2019ve talked about, but there is nothing like being inventive. Progressive music allows you to do that. \u201cProgressive\u201d means you experiment, and you go into places you wouldn\u2019t otherwise. So, I told them I would be glad to work on something with them. At the time, I already working on something with a drummer and that evolved into the Bletchley Park Project album.\n\nJoe:\n\nI know you also write and record library music. For those ignorant of the process, what is your approach to writing library music?\n\nDuncan:\n\nWell, library music started for me back in when I was still in the U.K. I became friends with people at KPM records, which was an affiliate of EMI. I started doing library music for them and it worked well for me, because, as I said, I\u2019m a bit of a tunesmith. With library music, they give you a kind of theme. They say, \u201cThis is going to be about industry,\u201d so you know it\u2019s gonna have to be powerful. Or they say, \u201cThis is going to be pastoral,\u201d so you think countryside and your tunes to go off in different directions from there. Once you have enough tunes, you end up with a library album that is suitable for your theme. I found that I was alright at that, and they liked what I was doing.\n\nJoe:\n\nHow did you get into soundtracking documentaries and TV shows? How is the approach taken for a soundtrack different?\n\nDuncan:\n\nConsequently, from the success with library music, came the commissions for film. The difference with writing for films and the like is that instead of an overall theme, you\u2019ve got a rough cut of the visuals or a storyboard. It enables you to fine-tune your work. The music is there to enhance the story not to take over. A perfect example is Jaws. Without the Jaws music, it\u2019s just somebody going for a swim on a beach. Pretty boring [imitates person snoring]. Because you hear that music [starts humming Jaws theme] you anticipate something exciting and awful is gonna happen. It\u2019s fabulous when music can do that. That\u2019s how I see music, whether it\u2019s rock \u2018n\u2019 roll or music for films. Is it making you feel something? What\u2019s it meant to do? If you can achieve a little bit of that you\u2019re winning.\n\nAll images courtesy of Duncan Mackay/Getty Images\n\nJoe:\n\nTell me a little about your studio.\n\nDuncan:\n\nThe studio has grown in importance for me as my life has changed from touring and all that to what I do now. My wife and I designed and built the studio in our house. I spent a lot of time in the studio, It\u2019s heaven.\n\nJoe:\n\nDo you only record your work, or others as well? If you do record others, are you involved as a producer, engineer, etc.?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI made a point to get into recording others in the studio because the opportunity is there. In this era, everybody I meet is a record producer or an engineer. I feel like it used to be quite an exclusive club, and I respect that. So, in 1,000 years I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m an engineer or a producer if I\u2019m being truthful. Yes, I am both, but that\u2019s not where I hang my hat. However, over the years, I\u2019ve learned some things. I\u2019m pretty good at pressing the buttons, I suppose. The whole point since I had my first eight-track studio \u2018til now, is that it enables me to create the music that\u2019s in my head or somebody else\u2019s head. It\u2019s a tool to create, hopefully, what everybody wants to hear. That\u2019s how I see my studio.\n\nJoe:\n\nAll of that aside, Duncan, what have you been up to in the past couple of years considering the current state of the world? Is Fluance a major point of focus?\n\nDuncan:\n\nYes. I\u2019ve been concentrating a lot on Fluance, which is the band that did Lunacy. When we brought out the Lunacy album, we dealt with Belle Antique because I\u2019ve got a deal with them. And they liked what I did in Japan. So, we were already getting ready for me to travel from Cape Town and Marty [Prior], the bass player, to travel from Spain to rehearse. Then hopefully go out and promote the album. Then, of course, the pandemic hits. So that all went out the window. It is a difficult time for everybody in any profession in the world, especially musicians. COVID and Brexit have completely screwed how musicians make money. It put a stop to things, with Fluance, for some time. There was nowhere to play because it was all closed down. The timing of the first album from Fluance was unfortunate. I said to the chaps, \u201cAll we can do in this time is use the time to create the best album we possibly can.\u201d So, we\u2019re getting to the end of completing the recording of it. That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019ve been doing in these strange times.\n\nJoe:\n\nSounds like you have been keeping yourself busy working on this new Fluance album. What can you tell us about it?\n\nDuncan:\n\nIt is 90% recorded. We have just in recent months found a new permanent guitarist. A guy called Mauritz Lotz. He lives in Johannesburg. It\u2019s funny, I\u2019ve been living in Cape Town for a long time now and I just discovered him. He is fitting in with the band rather well. He is in the process of putting some guitar on the tracks that we\u2019ve done. Then we sit down and decide where we go from there.\n\nJoe:\n\nAny other projects coming out in the future we should be aware of?\n\nDuncan:\n\nI\u2019m in the process of writing music for a movie that is coming out. It\u2019s from a South African film director and producer. He\u2019s planning to start shooting later this year. It has a wondrous title, Drunks Have Whiter Teeth. I\u2019ve been writing music for that when I\u2019m not working with Fluance.\n\n\u2013 Joe O\u2019Brien (@ JoeOB1005 ) is the Senior Columnist for www.vwmusicrocks.com and may be reached at joe@vinylwriter.com"}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/duncan-mackay-mike-reid-synths-80s-tv-show", "page_content": "Back in the \u201870s and \u201880s, British TV made plenty of attempts to introduce synthesizers to a mainstream audience, but perhaps none stranger than the one that featured former 10cc keyboard player Duncan Mackay explaining his impressive rig to comedian Mike Reid and a robot called Metal Mickey in an episode of children\u2019s game show Runaround.\n\nIn the clip, which was recently unearthed by Are Sounds Electrik? and was previously posted by Littlepixel (see above), the surreal scenes kick off around the six-minute mark, when a be-tracksuited Reid approaches Mackay and asks him to explain \"In layman's terms - because it gets a bit confusing - what's this all about?\"\n\nMackay is happy to indulge the ebullient East End entertainer, first by starting up his Roland CR-78 rhythm box and then turning to his impressive collection of synths. These include a Yamaha CS-80, a Roland RS-505 string machine and a pedal-powered Moog Taurus. You\u2019ll spot a Roland Space Echo there, too.\n\nAnd then the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. After battling to hold a conversation with Mackay while the synths do their thing, Reid reaches down out of shot and picks up a keytar. \u201cWhat sir, is that?\u201d he enquires, with Mackay explaining that it\u2019s a keyboard that can be played like a guitar.\n\nMetal Mickey\u2019s bemused expression probably reflects how most of the audience was feeling while all of this was going on - the whole thing is made weirder by the fact that, for reasons that remain unclear, the names Rick Wakeman, Oscar Peterson and Ernest Hemingway are written on the set wall. Once he\u2019s had enough, Reid ends up asking Mackay to turn everything off so that he can quiz him on his departure from 10cc and his future plans.\n\nHaving joined in 1978, Mackay left 10cc in 1981, which suggests that this is when the clip dates from. His illustrious career also saw him playing keyboards on Kate Bush\u2019s first three albums, and it\u2019s said that he was once considered for the position of keyboard player in Yes.\n\nReid, meanwhile, went on to enjoy considerable success playing the roguish Frank Butcher in BBC soap opera EastEnders. He died in 2007.\n\nAs for Metal Mickey, he had his own show at the time, which ran until 1983. His current whereabouts are unknown, but given the current obsession with all things AI, now could be the perfect time for a comeback."}, {"url":

"Personal\n\nFullname: Duncan MacKay\n\naka: Dunky MacKay\n\nBorn: 14 July 1937\n\nDied: 23 December 2019\n\nBirthplace: Springburn\n\nSigned: 11 April 1955\n\nLeft: 6 November 1964 (Third Lanark)\n\nPosition: Right-back\n\nDebut: Clyde 1-4 Celtic, League Cup, 9 Aug 1958\n\nInternationals: Scotland\n\nInternational Caps: 14\n\nInternational Goals: 0\n\nBiog\n\nThe classy Duncan MacKay signed for Celtic from Maryhill Harp in April 1955.\n\nOn his signing, he was proclaimed as the find of the season, and for the next season was \u201cthe best defensive prospect in the country\u201c.\n\nThe stylish right-back made his debut in a 4-1 League Cup win at Clyde in August 1958 and would spend the next six years as one of the top performers in disappointing & underachieving Celtic sides.\n\nDuncan MacKay had fantastic pace and stamina and he was a wonderful attacking full-back who was one of the first players in that position to use the over-lap as a regular feature of his game.\n\nWith fine control and a pin-point accurate pass, Duncan MacKay would always attempt to play the ball out of defence rather than just rely on the long clearance up the park. He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great. His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\nA highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\nHe would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\nIn November 1984, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland. He also gained 14 caps for Scotland during his playing career.\n\nThe thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic are with Duncan\u2019s family and friends at this very sad time.\n\nThe Celtic players will wear black armbands at today\u2019s game against St Mirren as a mark of respect.\n\nObituary: Duncan Mackay, highly esteemed Celtic full-back who won honours in Australia\n\nBy Matt Vallance\n\n(2)\n\nSource: https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18141730.obituary-duncan-mackay-highly-esteemed-celtic-full-back-won-honours-australia/Former Celtic captain and Scotland full-back\n\nBorn:July 14, 1937;\n\nDied: December 23, 2019.\n\nIT IS a long way from Maryhill to Melbourne, but in his 82 years that was the journey made by the esteemed former Celtic and Scotland full-back Dunky Mackay.\n\nLike many before him, Duncan\u2019s father, also Duncan, had left the West Highlands for the city, where he worked at several jobs to keep a roof over his family\u2019s head. He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/duncan.mackay/2398366", "page_content": "Duncan MacKay\n\nassociation football player\n\nJuly 14, 1937 Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Mackay turned professional when he joined Celtic from Maryhill Harp aged 17 in 1955.

Matches at Wembley Empire, where the swimming pool was frozen over in the winter so it could host matches, attracted crowds of 10,000, the leading players were earning more than the top footballers of the time and the magazine Ice Hockey World had 50,000 readers.\n\nThe money in the sport in Britain and the buzz surrounding the sport inevitably begun to attract players and coaches from overseas, particularly Canada, where the sport had developed and become immensely popular.\n\nAmong those was Foster, who had been born in Glasgow in Scotland, but who had emigrated with his parents to Canada at the age of six, settling in Winnipeg, an ice hockey hotbed, where his father worked as a blacksmith.\n\nIn 1932, Foster led Moncton Hawks of the Maritime Senior Hockey League to the finals of the Allan Cup. Canada\u2019s senior amateur men's ice hockey championship, and at one stage that season went an astonishing 417 minutes without conceding a goal.\n\nIn 1935, along with the coach of the Moncton Hawks and Foster's long-time mentor, Percy Nicklin, the fair-haired, five-foot, five-inch Foster moved to London to play for the Richmond Hawks. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) suspended Foster and team-mate Alexander Archer for \"leaving the dominion without permission\" to play in England.\n\nJimmy Foster managed four shutouts during the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen \u00a9IOC\n\nThe year Foster moved to England, Britain came third at the World Championships in Davos, and in the first stage led the eventual winners, Canada, before losing 4-2.\n\nUntil then, Britain\u2019s team had been made up mostly of army officers and students living in the UK, but the evolution of the sport meant it was growing in quality, thanks to the influx of overseas players into the game.\n\nAhearne, the BIHA secretary, appointed Nicklin as manager and instituted a rule that each domestic team was to field at least four British-born players, then put out a message across Canada: \"Were you born back home?\"\n\nTo quell growing anger across the Atlantic about this controversial recruitment policy, Ahearne and Erhardt sailed to Toronto to broker an agreement with the CAHA.\n\nA deal was sealed that meant the BIHA would forbid the use of players who had not obtained permission to move from Canada, and the CAHA would not deny that permission to anyone who followed the correct procedures.\n\nEmboldened, Ahearne and Erhardt spent the rest of the trip in Canada travelling the country to scout more potential new recruits.\n\nOf the British squad that travelled to Bavaria for the 1936 Winter Olympics, nine of the 13 had grown up in Canada with 11 having played most of their ice hockey there.\n\nBefore the matches started, the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace, as the IIHF was then known, held a meeting, where the CAHA complained about players leaving to play in the UK without permission. Britain strongly protested its innocence, but when a vote was taken, they lost. It meant Foster and Archer were suspended.\n\nA total of nine of the 13 players who represented Britain at Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 grew up in Canada \u00a9Getty Images\n\nThe British continued to insist they had not broken any rules, and three days into the tournament, the CAHA backed down and agreed that they would compete against Foster and Archer - a decision they would come to regret.\n\nBritain beat Sweden 1-0 in their opening group match, and then Japan 3-0 to qualify for the second stage.\n\nIn the first match of the second stage, Britain defeated Canada 2-1 at the Olympia-Kunsteisstadion, built in only 106 days to stage ice hockey and figure skating during the Games. Victory was clinched 80 seconds from the end when Edgar \"Chirp\" Brenchley, born in Sittingbourne but bought up in Niagara Falls, scored the winner.\n\nEven then, Foster was called upon several times more in the time that remained, standing firm against the late Canadian onslaught. There was no mass hysteria among the British team at the end on inflicting a first Olympic defeat on a team most believed to be invincible. They celebrated with handshakes and three cheers for their opponents.\n\nThe following night, Britain took on Germany, with an extra fourth period unable to separate the teams as both teams settled on a 1-1 draw. Just a few hours later, Britain were back in action at 9am but comfortably beat Hungary 5-1 in a match watched by German Chancellor Adolf Hitler and the Nazi\u2019s chief propagandist Joseph Goebbels and military leader Hermann G\u00f6ring.\n\nBoth Foster and team-mate Don Dailley passed their Olympic accreditations up to the VIP box - located above the dug out - for autographing. When World War Two broke out three years later Foster burned his. Dailley, though, did not, and when, in 1983, The Sunday Times published the \"Hitler Diaries\", he produced it to help prove that they were fake.\n\nThe British players pose in the dug out as Adolf Hitler watches their Olympic match against Hungary \u00a9IOC\n\nAt this point of the competition, Canada grew even angrier when a new format was introduced which meant each of the four teams would play twice, against those it had not met during the previous stage, carrying over the result gained against its remaining opponent.\n\nCanada had won every gold medal in Olympic ice hockey since it had made its debut at the Summer Games in Antwerp 1920 before becoming part of the winter edition when that was held for the first time at Chamonix 1924. They then retained the title at St. Moritz 1928 and Lake Placid 1932.\n\nBut under this new system, they realised that if Britain beat the US and Czechoslovakia then the gold medal would certainly be theirs. The Canadians claimed it was \"one of the worst manipulations in sporting history\" and asked that all four teams play another, a suggestion overwhelmingly rejected.\n\nThe US beat Czechoslovakia and so did Britain, 5-0. Foster now had four shutouts in seven games and knew that if they beat the US, they were champions.\n\nThe teams shared six scoreless periods before deciding enough was enough, and at the end, the stadium announcer informed the crowd that Britain had won the gold medal, though this was inaccurate.\n\nThe US could still pip Britain if they beat Canada without conceding a goal, or by 5-1 in their final match. But Canada beat them 1-0, ensuring gold went to the side they had come to resent.\n\nIn Glasgow, Foster\u2019s heroics were front page news alongside mass anti-fascist and anti-royalist demonstrations in Paris which took 50,000 armed police to quell.\n\nFoster, known as \u201cThe Parson\u201d because he aimed to become a minister, never did preach, and never returned to Scotland.\n\nResentment in Canada about how Great Britain ended their Olympic ice hockey monopoly at Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936 ran deep \u00a9Puckstruck\n\nAfter Garmisch-Partenkirchen 1936, Foster and Nicklin moved to play for the Harringay Greyhounds at an impressive new 8,200-seat arena. They stayed for four seasons, twice capturing the English National League title in 1938-1939 and 1939-1940.\n\nFor Great Britain, Foster continued to be Nicklin\u2019s rock. When the European Championships came to London in 1937, he was a brick wall, earning shutouts in eight of the nine games, helping to make Britain's retention of their title, which came as part of their Olympic victory, look easy.\n\nIn 1938 in Prague in Czechoslovakia, he kept out Germany and Norway on the first two days. His third clean sheet came in the vital contest against the host nation to determine the destiny of the European title.\n\nAgainst the odds, and with a hostile home crowd of 14,000 spectators against them, Foster again produced a shutout as Britain beat Czechoslovakia 1-0.\n\nThe event was held alongside the World Championships, where Britain won the silver medal as Canada gained some more consolation for their Olympic upset as they won 3-1. It was the second consecutive year they had pipped Britain to the gold medal, having done the same in London 12 months earlier.\n\nOverall, Foster played in 31 World Championship matches, 16 of which were shutouts.\n\nHe went back to Canada to work in the aircraft industry on the outbreak of World War Two, and subsequently was a salesman. He died on January 4 1969."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/24/athletics.duncanmackay", "page_content": "Carl Lewis has broken his silence on allegations that he was the beneficiary of a drugs cover-up, admitting he had tested positive for banned substances but claiming he was just one of \"hundreds\" of American athletes who were allowed to escape bans.\n\n\"There were hundreds of people getting off,\" he said. \"Everyone was treated the same.\"\n\nLewis has now acknowledged that he failed three tests during the 1988 US Olympic trials, which under international rules at the time should have prevented him from competing in the Seoul games two months later.\n\nThe admission is a further embarrassment for the United States Olympic Committee, which had initially denied claims that 114 positive tests between 1988 and 2000 were covered up. It will add weight to calls by leading anti-doping officials and top athletes for an independent inquiry into the US's record on drug issues.\n\nLast week Dr Wade Exum alleged that a ban imposed on Lewis after positive tests for three stimulants had been overturned by the USOC when the athlete said he had ingested them mistakenly in a herbal supplement.\n\nLewis received only a warning after officials ruled that his positive tests were due to \"inadvertent\" use. Some scientists believe the substances could have been a masking agent for more serious drugs, such as anabolic steroids.\n\n\"The climate was different then,\" said Lewis. \"Over the years a lot of people will sit around and debate that [the drug] does something. There really is no pure evidence to show that it does something. It does nothing.\"\n\nLewis, who was arrested in Los Angeles on Monday for suspected drink-driving which friends say was the result of depression over Exum's revelations, won the 100 metres gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics after Canada's Ben Johnson was stripped of the title when he tested positive for a steroid.\n\nLewis also won the long jump and finished second in the 200m behind his training partner Joe DeLoach, also named by Exum as having escaped a ban.\n\nJohnson has now demanded that Lewis be stripped of his medals from Seoul, although the International Olympic Committee has no plans to review the situation because it has a statute of limitation set at three years.\n\n\"Do you expect him to say anything different?\" said Lewis. \"I mean we're talking about Ben Johnson. Come on. Let's be realistic.\"\n\nLewis, 41, said he was not concerned about the uproar around the world caused by the revelations. \"It's ridiculous. Who cares?\" he said. \"I did 18 years of track and field and I've been retired five years, and they're still talking about me, so I guess I still have it.\"\n\nMoscow is to launch its bid for the 2012 Olympic Games by staging the richest meeting in athletics history, offering a $1m (\u00a3630,000) purse to anyone who breaks the 100m world record.\n\nBritain's Dwain Chambers will join the United States' world record holder Tim Montgomery and the Olympic and world champion Maurice Greene in an event in which the winner is guaranteed $500,000, nearly 10 times what the gold medallist in the world championships in Paris will earn.

But, like everyone else, so upset are the IOC that they were taken for a ride - literally - by the American that they seem prepared to try to find a way to circumnavigate their own rules to take it away from him.John Coates, the Australian lawyer who is a member of the IOC Executive Board, claims that the statute \"simply doesn't apply if you have broken the law\". That seems a fair enough argument but, while Armstrong may have been tried and found guilty in the court of public opinion, he hasn't actually been convicted of anything criminal (although he may still face perjury charges at some point in the distant future).Thomas Bach, meanwhile, another lawyer, who is in pole position to replace Jacques Rogge as President of the IOC, claims that they must strip Armstrong of the medal because they have a \"zero-tolerance policy on doping\".Well, if that's the case, and they are going to be consistent, then the IOC had better book a meeting room in the Palace Hotel in Lausanne on a long-term basis, get their most recent copy of The Complete Book of the Olympics by David Wallechinsky off the shelf, take the tops off their red pens and start revising because this could take some time...Where shall we start?I know, how about the time trial from the Sydney Olympics in 2000? Yes, the very same race that Armstrong finished third in and which the IOC are so keen to revise the result for. Because there, in second place, just one spot ahead of Lance was Jan Ullrich, his old German rival, who claimed the silver medal to add to the gold he had won earlier in the Games in the road race.Like Armstrong, right to the time he got off his bike and hung up his helmet, he denied doping, although there was plenty of circumstantial evidence for which you hardly needed to be Hercule Poirot to have your suspicions aroused even before he was found guilty of a historic doping offence earlier this year, despite having retired in 2007.That was even before Ullrich's old boss at Telekom, Rudy Pevenage, admitted in the wake of the Armstrong scandal that they had doped. The IOC has already investigated Ullrich once but decided that there was nothing they could do because the statute of limitations had expired (even though they are prepared to overlook that in the case of Armstrong).Okay, there is a grey area here because Pevenage has claimed that Ullrich was \"clean\" between 1998 - when the Festina scandal erupted - and 2001 when they realised their US rival \"had become superhuman...and we tried to find the recipe, the same recipe as Armstrong\". But is there anyone out there who truly believes that Ullrich is more deserving of being allowed to keep his medals from Sydney than Armstrong? I think not.How about another case, that of the British runner Mike McLeod. He crossed the line third in the 10,000 metres at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles but was promoted after Finnish rival Matti Vainio, who finished second, was disqualified for failing a drugs test for anabolic steroids, the first track and field medal winner to be disqualified at an Olympic Games.Then, several years later, the Italian gold medallist Alberto Cova, confessed to blood doping, a process where blood is taken from the athlete, stored while the body replenishes itself, then given back prior to competition. The procedure was sanctioned by the Italian athletics federation at the time but was not technically illegal because of a loophole in the rules, so another grey area the IOC will argue.But, let's call a spade a spade here, it was cheating and if the IOC are to embrace this new policy of \"zero tolerance\" however much time has elapsed, then surely there is a 60-year-old grandfather in Newcastle who deserves to be given the gold medal he was cheated out nearly 30 years ago?Okay, I can see that this isn't as easy as it looks. So how about a case where there is no doubt, where the athlete themselves have admitted that they were doped when they won their gold medal and have even asked the authorities to strip them of their performances? We can't get any more clear-cut than that, can we? They have even looked their beaten opponent in the eye and admitted that they cheated.Step forward Petra Schneider, the East German swimmer who won the 400m medley at Moscow in 1980. She has subsequently acknowledged that she was fuelled throughout her career by anabolic steroids prescribed to her by the East German authorities. So honest was she that when she met Sharron Davies, the Briton she beat in the Soviet capital, for a television programme she admitted it on camera.After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, hundreds of thousands of pages of documentary evidence was uncovered of a state-administered drugs programme involving leading athletes, like Schneider, who could be identified by codes or in some cases letters kept in Stasi files. They are the \"War and Peace\" of doping history and make the 1,000 page document prepared by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) on the Armstrong case look like an Enid Blyton paperback.Besides Schneider, those named in public include track and field Olympic champions Marita Koch, Barbel Wockel, Heike Drechsler, J\u00fcrgen Schult and Thomas Munkelt.Yet, look at the results from when GDR made their Olympic debut at Mexico City in 1968 until Seoul 1988, which marked their final appearance, their names are all still there, including Schneider.The United States Olympic Committee asked for the redistribution of gold medals won at Montreal in 1976 after Andrea Pollack, a swimmer who won two gold medals there, admitted she had been doped at the time. But, despite court rulings in Germany that substantiate claims of systematic doping, the IOC Executive Board has always resisted revising the results.In turning down the American petition on behalf of its women's medley relay team in Montreal and a similar petition from the British Olympic Association on behalf of Davies, the IOC has always made it clear that it wanted to discourage any such appeals in the future.Even if Armstrong is stripped of his medal tomorrow the IOC apparently plan to leave the third place position vacant rather than redistributing it to the fourth-placed Abraham Olano Manzano from Spain. That is following the lead of the International Cycling Union (UCI), who have declined to reallocate any of Arrmsong's seven Tour de France victories between 1999 and 2005, perhaps mindful that in three of those years Ullrich had finished second to him.There is a precedent for an Olympic \"ghost\" race, of course. Three years ago, at the corresponding IOC Executive Board meeting, they took away the five medals, four of them gold, American Marion Jones had won at Sydney, the end of a long running saga that had started when she was still covered by the IOC's statute of limitations following her admission that she had been using drugs at the time.The medals they took away included the gold in the 100m, which they declined to re-award to the runner-up Ekaterina Thanou, the Greek who herself has been banned for being linked to drugs. That decision by the IOC was perhaps perfectly understandable given the circumstances.But, if they decide to take action against Armstrong tomorrow even though it would clearly be illegal under the rules of the Olympic Charter and strip him of his medal (good luck getting him to package it up and post it back to Lausanne, by the way), they could stand accused of victimisation. I, though prefer to think that Armstrong is more suffering from his cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre (although I have no sympathy for him).It is unlikely that the IOC would have been as tough on, say for example, an Eastern European weightlifter from Sydney who had been exposed as a drugs cheat a dozen years later because such a case would have warranted just a few lines in the media. Then they would have hid behind the Olympic Charter and the \"statute of limitations\".Armstrong doesn't deserve to keep his bronze medal but nor do the likes of Davies deserve the injustice of seeing the IOC ignore the statute of limitations that were used to deny them the justice they craved just because they need to be seen to be tough now."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/23/athletics.duncanmackay", "page_content": "Athletics\n\nCarl Lewis has been arrested for alleged drink-driving after crashing his sports car, the result, friends claim, of last week's allegations when he was named as one of more than 100 US athletes who had positive drug tests covered up.\n\nThe nine-times Olympic gold medallist was arrested by the Californian highway patrol and charged after tests revealed he had a blood alcohol level of 0.08 - the state's legal limit - after a crash in which he wrecked his Maserati in the early hours of Monday morning in Los Angeles.\n\nFriends say Lewis was depressed after the release of documents by Dr Wade Exum, the former anti-doping officer of the US Olympic Committee, saying he had tested positive three times at the 1988 Olympic trials in Indianapolis for small traces of stimulants.\n\nIt should have resulted in a ban preventing him from competing in the Seoul games, where he won two gold medals, including the 100 metres, but the USOC failed to follow international rules in operation at the time and allowed him to compete. Lewis has denied the allegations.\n\nSince retiring from athletics in 1997 he has virtually cut himself off from the sport, turning down lucrative offers to work as a television commentator and labelling the sport \"boring\". It is a decision friends say he now regrets and one made worse by the fact that the latest revelations mean it is unlikely anyone will want to employ him.\n\nHe has instead concentrated on trying to build an acting career in Hollywood but he has failed to make much impression. Lewis, who has taken acting lessons, said on his retirement that he was determined to avoid being typecast in the role of a sportsman and said he would like the opportunity to star in films where he acts the hardman.\n\n\"I'd love to do a role which is different to my public persona,\" he said at the time. \"I've been pretty calm and low-key and focused, and I'd like to do something that shows the other side of my character - excitable, angry, tough.\"\n\nHis most recent role was in a science fiction film entitled Alien Hunter, in which he played a communications officer. It has been panned by critics, as was his previous film Atomic Twister, in which he played a security guard.\n\nLewis has instead found himself in the news for reasons he would rather have avoided as athletes and administrators have called for an inquiry into Exum's allegations.\n\nAustralia's David Culbert, who competed against Lewis in the long jump in 1988 and is now a senior official with his national federation, said that it was the apparent hypocrisy of the American which was the most surprising aspect of the whole affair. \"Given that he's been so strident in his comments about other athletes who have taken performance-enhancing drugs, if [the allegations] are true then he's lived a pretty strong lie,\" Culbert said.\n\nIt is that kind of criticism which has left Lewis feeling so depressed, friends claim.\n\nHe was tried and acquitted on a drink-driving charge in 1991.

Built in 1894, the landmark Blackpool Tower houses a circus, a glass viewing platform and the Tower Ballroom, where dancers twirl to the music of a Wurlitzer organ. Blackpool Illuminations is an annual light show along the Promenade that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.\n\nIt is also home to Blackpool Football Club, who have played their home matches at Bloomfield Road since 1901 in a stadium where three of the four stands are named after legendary players, including Jimmy Armfield, a member of England's 1966 World Cup-winning squad. Others are named after Stan Mortensen and Sir Stanley Matthews, who, in 1953, combined to give the club its finest moment when they lifted the FA Cup.\n\nThe final at Wembley Stadium against Bolton Wanderers was known as the \"Matthews Final\" due to the outstanding contribution of the 38-year-old Sir Stanley, the most popular player of his day. In the first major sports event to be broadcast live on British television, he helped inspire a famous comeback as a Mortensen hat-trick saw Blackpool recover from 3-1 down to win 4-3 after losing in the 1948 and 1951 finals.\n\nA blue plaque at the entrance of Blackpool Town Hall marks the achievement of Lucy Morton, the first British female swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal in an individual event, the 200m breaststroke at Paris 1924 \u00a9ITG\n\nWhile wandering around the town, I came across an equally outstanding sporting achievement that I knew less about. At the entrance to Blackpool Town Hall, there is a blue plaque celebrating Lucy Morton, winner of an Olympic gold medal at Paris 1924 in the 200 metres breaststroke, making her Britain's first women's individual swimming champion.\n\nMorton's family had moved to Blackpool when her father secured a job as the Mayoral attendant with accommodation provided at the Town Hall. Her entry into the world of swimming came in an unusual way when her school headmistress Mrs Phillips sent a note to her father warning that she was \"the biggest dunce in the school and swimming might brighten her ideas up a bit\".\n\nSo, aged 10, Morton became a member of the Blackpool Amateur Swimming Club, where a hidden talent was unleashed. She was so successful that she competed in the Northern Counties Championships in 1913 and won the 100 yards breaststroke event. In 1916 she won the 150y backstroke in a then world record time. She also came second in the 200y breaststroke event, a feat she repeated in the 1919 Championships.\n\nThe cancellation of the 1916 Olympic Games in Berlin due to World War One deprived Morton of any opportunities in that direction. Similarly in 1920, after she had completed successful trials for the Olympic team, she was unable to compete in the Games in Antwerp because her breaststroke and backstroke events were not competed for by women, who were only allowed to take part in freestyle races.\n\nLucy Morton came from behind at Paris 1924 to clinch the Olympic gold medal \u00a9Blackpool Council\n\nMorton refused to give up, though, and in February 1924 was invited for trials for the Olympic squad. It was out of season and the Cocker Street Baths where she trained were closed until Easter. However, the pool superintendent, George Swarbrick, also her coach, was permitted to open them for her to train before and after her work at St Annes Post Office.\n\nThe hard work paid off and Morton was one of 13 swimmers selected for Paris 1924 who would contest the five female swimming events. Even before the events began Morton had an eventful time, as on one of her journeys to training, her taxi was involved in an accident, and she lost five front teeth.\n\nThe Piscine des Tourelles in Paris hosted the swimming events during the Olympics, and it was here, on July 18, 1924, that Morton made history by becoming the first woman to win a gold medal in a breaststroke event. The United States\u2019 Agnes Geraghty was the favourite and led for the first three-quarters of the race before Morton put on a late burst to touch the wall first in 3min 33.2sec. She won by less than a second with British team-mate Gladys Carson taking the bronze medal.\n\nMorton was so modest, that when she wrote home after her victory, she covered several other topics in her letter before mentioning her Olympic success.\n\nWhen she did, she wrote: \"I finally finished and asked who won - all the bath seemed to be teeming with British swimmers trying to pull me out of the water. 'You've won,' they cried. We asked for the flag to be hoisted but nothing happened. The reason for the delay was that all week the Americans had swept the board and both the American anthem, and the flag Stars and Stripes was pure routine.\n\n\"I upset the apple cart for first, USA second and Britain third. Consternation! They couldn't find a British flag so had to run up a small one in the centre with a large USA one in second position and a small British one on the other side.\"\n\nLucy Morton was met by 10,000 people upon her return from Paris 1924 and a civic reception at Blackpool Town Hall was held for her \u00a9Blackpool Council\n\nUpon returning to Blackpool, Morton was welcomed by 10,000 people at the train station and a civic reception held in her honour.\n\nWell-wishers also showered her with gifts, one of which was a piano.\n\nMorton retired from competition shortly after the 1924 Olympics, marrying local man Harry Heaton, but continued performing in demonstrations, including a summer season at the Blackpool Tower Circus, appearing alongside acts such as Doodles, the Blackpool clown, and Olga's Troupe of Geese.\n\nMorton went on to become a professional swimming teacher and coached future international swimmers, including 1956 Olympian Anne Morton (no relation), at Blackpool Swimming Club, as well as officiating at various championships in Britain.\n\nMorton died in August 1980 but was recognised in 1988 when she was inducted into the International Hall of Fame and later into the Swim England Hall of Fame.\n\nLucy Morton's Olympic gold medal was auctioned in 2019 with Blackpool Council paying more than \u00a312,000 to ensure that it stayed in the town \u00a9Hansons Auctioneers And Valuers Ltd\n\nIn 2019, Blackpool Council bought Morton's Paris 1924 gold medal and other memorabilia from her career for \u00a312,225 ($15,150/\u20ac14,340) at an auction after the swimmer's granddaughter Julia Routledge sold it.\n\nShe claimed passing on the items was \"emotional,\" but she was pleased they were going to a good home. The collection is now on display at the town's library. Joan Humble, then chair of Blackpool Civic Trust, described Morton as a \"truly remarkable woman\". It helped ensure the Council's efforts to protect the legacy of a true pioneer having unveiled the blue plaque in 2012.\n\nTo most people, Sir Stanley will always be the first name when they think about Blackpool's sporting heritage, but Lucy Morton deserves to be up there with the great footballer."}, {"url": "https://paw.princeton.edu/memorial/duncan-ad-mackay-%E2%80%9942", "page_content": "Duncan Mackay died Jan. 15, 2013, in Washington, D.C.

What has only now emerged is that, when the gold medal went to the second-place finisher Lewis, the American should not have been there because he had tested positive for banned stimulants at the US Olympic trials two months earlier. It means that the rightful winner should have been Britain's Linford Christie, a man who himself had a narrow escape in Seoul and has a colourful doping history.\n\nThey were not the only runners in that race with drug-tainted histories. Dennis Mitchell, who would also have benefited if Lewis had not been there, by finishing third instead of fourth, had problems with the dope-busters. He was later banned for testosterone, despite infamously claiming the test result was from drinking beer and having sex the night before submitting his urine sample. Desai Williams, a Canadian training partner of Johnson's who finished sixth, was later implicated in the government-sponsored Dubin Inquiry as having used drugs during his career.\n\nThe disclosure emerged after Dr Wade Exum, the former United States Olympic Committee director for drug control from 1991 to 2000, released more than 30,000 pages of documents relating to cases detailing cover-ups involving some of the biggest American names in Olympic sport. Lewis was just one of three future gold medallists, along with the 200m winner Joe DeLoach and the 400m hurdle champion Andre Phillips, who tested positive at the Olympic trials in Indianapolis. Lewis, in fact, tested positive three times for small amounts of banned stimulants: pseudoephedrine, ephedrine and phenylpropanolamine. Under international rules at the time all three athletes should have been suspended for three months.\n\nAfter first disqualifying Lewis the USOC accepted his appeal on the basis of inadvertent use due to an over-the-counter health tonic, although he had appeared in a USOC video two years earlier warning of the dangers of supplements. Lewis went on to win gold at Seoul not only in the 100m but also the long jump and finish second to DeLoach in the 200m.\n\nExum's papers reveal more than 100 positive drug tests involving US athletes from 1988 to 2000. In many cases, he alleged, the athletes were not prevented from competing. Included in the documents are details implicating athletes who won 19 Olympic medals from 1984 to 2000.\n\nThe documents prove what the sporting community has long suspected: the US did not take drug testing seriously while accusing the rest of the world, particularly the Soviet Union and East Germany. \"The reputation is out there, internationally, that the Americans haven't been clean,\" said Norway's Johann Olav Kloss, a four-time speed-skating gold medallist, now a member of the IOC.\n\nDick Pound, the head of the recently set-up World Anti-Doping Agency, claimed letters purportedly written by the then USOC executive director Baaron Pittenger, advising Lewis, DeLoach and Phillips they had tested positive but were being cleared to compete in Seoul, was proof of a cover-up.\n\n\"It sounds like they determined they were going to be accidental even before they notify the guy,\" he said. \"It looks like there was an almost automatic forgiveness for some of these athletes.\"\n\nIt was not just athletes who escaped punishment. Others included the tennis player Mary Joe Fernandez, winner of a gold and a silver medal in Barcelona 1992; the footballer Alexei Lalas and Dave Schultz, a wrestler who won a gold medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. All tested positive for stimulants.\n\nIt is the fact, however, that Lewis - winner of a record nine Olympic gold medals and the man voted the greatest athlete of the 20th century by the International Association of Athletics Federations - is entangled in a scandal that will send the biggest shockwaves across the sport. He joins Johnson and Christie in a sprinting hall of shame.\n\nChristie narrowly avoided his own three-month doping ban in Seoul after testing positive for pseudoephedrine he claimed to have ingested in ginseng tea following his fourth place in the 200m. Two members of the IOC disciplinary committee that heard his case were asleep when they voted on the matter and he scraped through by one vote.\n\nChristie was later banned for two years after testing positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone. Technically, though, he could claim he would have won a silver medal in the 200m in Seoul if the winner, DeLoach, and the runner-up, Lewis, had been banned as they should have been. Robson Da Silva, the Brazilian who took the bronze medal, would have an even stronger case if the IOC's rules allowed them to act.\n\n\"The rules of the IOC stipulate that no decision taken in the context of the Olympics can be challenged after a period of three years from the day of the closing ceremony,\" said Giselle Davies, the IOC spokeswoman.\n\nLewis, throughout his career, presented himself as the moral guardian of the sport. At the US Olympic trials in Sacramento in 2000 he refused to attend a champions dinner in an anti-drugs protest. He used as proof the fact Exum had recently launched a lawsuit against the USOC which alleged officials undermined anti-doping programmes so effectively that half of the American athletes who had tested positive between 1988 and 2000 had not been punished. Yet at no point, especially not in his much-hyped 1990 autobiography Inside Track, has Lewis ever revealed he was part of the cover-up.\n\nExum had planned to use the documents in his racial discrimination and wrongful termination suit against the USOC but the case was dismissed in court last week due to lack of evidence. \"I never wanted to out athletes,\" said Exum. \"I never wanted to name names. Can these names help settle the issue and change the system? We'll see.\""}]}
