{"Fall Out Boy has since recorded six studio albums, including the multi-platinum selling albums From Under the Cork Tree (2005) and Infinity on High (2007).": [{"url": "https://variety.com/2023/music/news/fall-out-boy-new-album-elektra-records-so-much-for-stardust-1235234976/", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy has signed with Fueled by Ramen/ Elektra Records and announced its first studio album in four years, titled \u201cSo Much (for) Stardust,\u201d coming March 24.\n\nThe announcement comes with the release of single \u201cLove From the Other Side,\u201d which Fall Out Boy will perform on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d Wednesday night. The band also released a music video for the song, directed by David Braun and Open the Portal.\n\nThe video is a characteristically humorous clip that is an elaborate sort of fairy tale that a grandfather (played by the band\u2019s Pete Wentz) reads to his granddaughter in an opening scene that evokes \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d film \u2014 when he pulls the book off of the shelf, other titles are seen that hilariously combine emo band names with classic children\u2019s and young people\u2019s books: \u201cGood Charlotte\u2019s Web,\u201d \u201cThe Weezer of Oz,\u201d \u201cThe Giving Plain White Tee,\u201d \u201cCatch-182,\u201d etc.\n\nThe bandmembers then take off on a comical nautical adventure that is also filled with self-referential jokes: there\u2019s an \u201cEmo Island\u201d and a \u201cWinnetkaland,\u201d (Winnetka is a suburb of the band\u2019s hometown of Chicago).\n\nIn the press release announcing the album, the bandmembers said, \u201cTechnology has made it really easy to make records much more quickly these days. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, and that spontaneity can be exciting,\u201d vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump said in a statement. \u201cBut we wanted to get back to the way we used to work. We wanted to make a record that was really lovingly crafted and deliberate and patiently guided \u2013 like someone cooked you a delicate meal. I\u2019m not a very proud guy, but I\u2019m pretty proud of this record.\u201d\n\nThe announcement marks a homecoming of sorts for the band, who released their debut album in 2003 via Fueled by Ramen, which has been distributed by Elektra since 2018.\n\nElektra Records\n\n\u201cSo Much (for) Stardust\u201d also sees the band reuniting with producer Neal Avron, who they collaborated with on albums \u201cFrom Under the Cork Tree,\u201d \u201cInfinity on High\u201d and \u201cFolie \u00e0 Deux.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur band has been an ongoing art project for 20 years and we know there have been many inception points along that journey,\u201d bassist Pete Wentz said. \u201cWe wanted to create an album that merged those points together \u2013 something new, but carved from our foundation. Fueled By Ramen and Elektra seemed like the perfect home for this.\u201d\n\nJohnny Minardi, VP of A&R for Fueled by Ramen/ Elektra, added: \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited to welcome back Fall Out Boy to the Fueled By Ramen family. It\u2019s been twenty years since the release of their debut album on Fueled By Ramen, and it\u2019s a true pleasure to be working together again. Growing up in Chicago, I had the privilege of watching Fall Out Boy play DIY venues around the city, eventually growing into the global superstars we know them as today. They are a truly special band that has altered the landscape of rock music and who continually evolve with each new release. They have made an incredible album and we can\u2019t wait for the world to hear it.\u201d\n\nThe veteran pop-punk band has been teasing a new era as of late, first placing a cryptic ad in the Chicago Tribune in November and setting up multiple teaser web sites for fans before officially announcing \u201cLove From the Other Side\u201d last week. During a performance at iHeartRadio\u2019s Alter Ego Fest on Saturday night, Wentz also hinted at a possible tour, telling the crowd that he \u201ccan\u2019t wait to spend the next year with you.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy had been signed to Island Records for most of its career, releasing music through imprint DCD2, which was founded by members Wentz and Stump in 2005. After the band\u2019s hiatus from 2009 to 2013, they signed a new three album deal with Island, which was completed in 2018 with the band\u2019s most recent studio album, \u201cMania.\u201d\n\nConsisting of vocalist Stump, bassist Wentz, guitarist Joe Trohman and drummer Andy Hurley, Fall Out Boy formed in 2001 and made their debut with 2003\u2019s \u201cTake This to Your Grave.\u201d The band has made an indelible impact on rock music in the 21st century, becoming one of the most popular pop-punk bands of all time and helping to take the genre into the mainstream. Fall Out Boy has thus far released seven studio albums, with their most recent effort, \u201cMania,\u201d receiving a Grammy nomination for best rock album in 2019. In 2006, the band was also nominated for a Grammy in the best new artist category. Most recently, Fall Out Boy joined fellow rock legends Weezer and Green Day on the Hella Mega tour in 2021."}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/infinity-on-high-fall-out-boy-album/", "page_content": "Cover: Courtesy of Island Def Jam Music Group\n\nFall Out Boy made a rapid transition to the mainstream when their second album, From Under The Cork Tree, debuted at No.9 on the Billboard 200 in May 2005. Yet the band held their heads and while \u2026 Cork Tree won them Grammy nominations and an MTV Music Video Award, creating their third album, Infinity On High, remained their primary focus during 2006.\n\nListen to Infinity On High on Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nDespite their relentless touring schedule, the young Chicagoan alt.rockers constantly worked up fresh material and their graft bore fruit. Indeed, they assembled an impressive stack of new tracks which they arranged with \u2026 Cork Tree producer Neal Avron during six weeks of intensive rehearsals prior to album sessions in LA during the summer of 2006.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely writing all the time,\u201d the band\u2019s bassist and primary lyricist, Pete Wentz, confirmed for VH1 during this period. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what\u2019s been wrong with the rock industry \u2013 bands go away and disappear off the face of the planet. That\u2019s not going to be for Fall Out Boy!\u201d\n\nA confident band\n\nGuitarist/vocalist Patrick Stump also revealed the band could handle the pressure of following up the double-platinum-selling From Under The Cork Tree in a Gibson Guitars interview. \u201cThe second you worry about other peoples\u2019 expectations, you can expect failure,\u201d he said. \u201cNot that we don\u2019t have big hopes for this album \u2013 we want our fans to love it more than anything. But you can\u2019t sit around second-guessing everything \u2013 you make sterile music that way.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Fall Out Boy were brimming with confidence when they entered the studio. Three months later, when they emerged with Infinity On High, they were clutching an impressively diverse record which also harbored several high-profile collaborations. The adrenalized opening cut, \u201cThriller,\u201d included a spoken-word introduction from iconic rapper Jay Z, while the lush, cinematic pop of \u201cThnks Fr Th Mmrs\u201d was overseen by Grammy-winning producer Babyface, and Panic! At The Disco\u2019s Ryan Ross added an expressive guitar solo to the strutting, \u201cRebel Rebel\u201d-esque \u201cThe Take Over, The Breaks Over.\u201d\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nInfinity On High was trailed by the crunching punk-pop nugget \u201cThe Carpal Tunnel Of Love,\u201d but its second single represented another significant stylistic departure. \u201cThis Ain\u2019t A Scene, It\u2019s An Arms Race\u201d reflected the band\u2019s collective love of 70s funk and disco, though the song\u2019s quintessentially anthemic chorus further supplemented its radio-friendly appeal and it shot to No.2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 2007. Boosted by a promotional video starring Kim Kardashian, the swift follow-up, \u201cThnks Fr Th Mmrs,\u201d also charted highly in the US, where it peaked at No.11 in March 2007.\n\nA shamelessly melodic record\n\nSandwiched between the two single releases, Infinity On High was released on February 6, 2007, shot to No.1 on the Billboard chart, and continued to bolster the band\u2019s international reputation. Indeed, the Illinois boys\u2019 steadily rising profile also guided the album to the top of the UK Top 40 and into the Top 5 in Australia, where Infinity On High eventually went double-platinum. For the most part, the critics were bowled over, too, with Billboard dubbing it \u201ca shamelessly melodic, wild and powerful pop record\u201d and Entertainment Weekly commending Fall Out Boy for \u201ctheir sense of swing\u201d in incorporating R&B influences into their pop-punk sound.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAs for the band, they were especially gratified that fans and press alike had picked up on Infinity On High\u2019s eclectic spread of material.\n\n\u201cBending genres is very exciting to me,\u201d Patrick Stump revealed. \u201cI think we\u2019re at a time like the [late] 70s, where New Wave bands like Blondie incorporated disco into their music, messing up peoples\u2019 minds\u2026 If Fall Out Boy can be a genre-defying band, then so be it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for!\u201d\n\nInfinity On High can be bought here."}, {"url": "https://www.thepostathens.com/article/2023/01/fall-out-boy-returns-new-single-album-announcement", "page_content": "It\u2019s been five years since Fall Out Boy released their seventh studio album, \u201cMANIA\u201d (2018), and almost four years since they have released any new music at all (i.e. their three-track EP, \u201cLake Effect Kid\u201d (2018) and 2019 greatest hits compilation, \u201cBelievers Never Die Vol. 2\u201d). Although the band had been touring in those past few years (post-quarantine in 2021), namely on their area tour with Green Day and Weezer on The Hella Mega Tour, the fans were desperately pleading for new music.\n\nOn January 18th, their pleas were heard and Fall Out Boy released their first single, \u201cLove From The Other Side.\u201d The band had been inadvertently teasing the release of new music in early December with cryptic websites and oddly inviting postcards sent to fans. On Christmas, fans received a strange email containing a weird video of a claymation dog traveling through \u201cthe other side of the apocalypse.\u201d Fans were unsure what to make of it, but one thing was for sure: the boys were back. Almost three weeks later, Fall Out Boy officially announced the release of their new track and declared its release on January 18th.\n\n\u201cLove From The Other Side\u201d opens with a beautiful, starry-sounding piano accompanied by bright, almost melancholy strings. It quickly crescendos into hard-hitting drums and rapturing electric guitars, which captures the listener\u2019s attention quickly. The drums and guitar added together with the violins make for a lovely cacophony of sound and really draws the listener into the rest of the song.\n\nThe song draws back on Fall Out Boy\u2019s older albums, namely their 2008 Grammy-nominated album \u201cFolie \u00e1 Deux,\u201d with their heavy rock front and additional string accompaniment. Some fans might also feel a sense of nostalgia from the return of their rock-heavy roots as producer Neal Avron came back to produce the track. Avron produced three Fall Out Boy records, \u201cFrom Under The Cork Tree\u201d (2005), \u201cInfinity On High\u201d (2007) and the aforementioned \u201cFolie \u00e1 Deux.\u201d The return of Avron\u2019s signature producing style is quite evident on the track, and fans are overjoyed to see his return as he has produced some of Fall Out Boy\u2019s most fan-favorite albums.\n\nThe lyrics are exquisite, as always, thanks to lyricist and bassist Pete Wentz. They reflect a sort of melancholy, as Fall Out Boy lyrics typically do, and reflection on the band\u2019s past as well as looking at where they are now. The music video reflects this mentality, although masked in a fairy-tale allegory of wicked wolves and magical amulets. Moreover, the track is a beautifully crafted story of the band\u2019s history while also showcasing where they\u2019re at now as a band.\n\n\u201cLove From The Other Side\u201d is the opening track of their new record, \u201cSo Much (For) Stardust,\u201d which is set to be released on March 24th. As of now, there has been no announcement of a new single releasing in the time before the album\u2019s release, but the band teased that there\u2019s \u201clots more to come soon.\u201d Whether it be tour dates or more singles, Fall Out Boy fans are eagerly awaiting more content from the band. In the meantime, stream \u201cLove From The Other Side\u201d wherever you stream your music because it is an absolute banger!\n\n@brookekillslive\n\nbp655221@ohio.edu"}, {"url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/fall-out-boy-albums-ranked-7776947/", "page_content": "When Fall Out Boy initially announced their seventh LP, M A N I A, last April, fans were thrown for a bit of a loop upon hearing the rackety, EDM-influenced initial single \u201cYoung And Menace.\u201d With a then-oddly spaced album title (first styled M A N I A) and bright neon-colored cover, FOB seemed to be going in a new direction for their next project \u2014 that is, until they scrapped almost the entire thing.\n\nExplore Explore Fall Out Boy See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news\n\nM A N I A was initially set for a Sept. 15 release, with a fall tour to coincide. While the tour still happened, the album was pushed back to 2018, mainly because the guys simply weren\u2019t happy with what they\u2019d created. \u201cThe album just isn\u2019t ready, and it felt very rushed,\u201d frontman Patrick Stump tweeted upon announcing the new Jan. 19 release date. \u201cI\u2019m never going to put a record out I genuinely don\u2019t believe is as strong or valid as the one that came before it and in order to do that we need a little bit more time to properly and carefully record solid performances.\u201d\n\n[readmore:7775665]\n\nThe wait may have felt like an especially long one due to the circumstances, but Fall Out Boy fans have finally received their latest piece of FOB work. Although \u201cYoung And Menace\u201d hinted that the next Fall Out Boy album may be quite a bit different than the six lovable albums they\u2019ve put out over the years, from their 2003 debut Take This To Your Grave to 2015\u2019s American Beauty/American Psycho, the guys clearly did some w orthwhile re-working, as Stump insinuated.\n\nBut where does M A N I A fall amongst the rest of the Fall Out Boy discography? Check out Billboard\u2018s ranking and see if you agree.\n\n7. American Beauty/American Psycho (2015)\n\nHonestly, it almost pains us to call this the \u201cworst\u201d Fall Out Boy album. Because, in reality, that doesn\u2019t really exist. Although the last-place ranking may insinuate that it\u2019s bad, that is not the way to describe the band\u2019s most recent LP. It\u2019s ambitious, as shown by the sampling on \u201cUma Thurman\u201d and \u201cCenturies,\u201d while staying true to the carefree rock that Fall Out Boy has always been about. Other than the unnecessarily intense title track, it\u2019s a quality album. But when pitted against FOB\u2019s other releases, the lyrics of the verses/choruses and more mainstream rock sound just don\u2019t measure up to what they put out in the beginning.\n\nFall Out Boy, 'American Beauty/American Psycho' Courtesy Photo\n\n6. M A N I A (2018)\n\nAfter kicking off their seventh album cycle with perhaps their most off-the-wall track to date, the almost headache-inducing calamity \u201cYoung and Menace,\u201d the Fall Out Boy guys realized that the project they had crafted maybe wasn\u2019t quite what they were hoping for their 2017 effort. So FOB decided to scrap the majority of the album and start over \u2014 and the results were so much more authentically Fall Out Boy than the initial go. More rock-focused tracks such as \u201cThe Last of the Real Ones\u201d and \u201cHOLD ME TIGHT OR DON\u2019T\u201d are reminiscent of the rough-around-the-edges guys FOB fans have grown to know and love, but with a more current twist that doesn\u2019t sound quite as confused as the initial single. The group incorporates production more than they seemingly ever have \u2014 especially on tracks like \u201cChampion\u201d and \u201cChurch\u201d \u2014 while still staying true to the cheeky rockers they\u2019ve always been with lines like \u201cI\u2019ll stop wearing black when they make a darker color\u201d (in \u201cWilson (Expensive Mistakes)\u201d) and some totally random song titles (\u201cStay Frosty Royal Milk Tea\u201d and \u201cBishops Knife Trick\u201d). It\u2019s not quite classic Fall Out Boy, but a pretty solid way to prove that they can still rock in 2018.\n\nFall Out Boy, 'M A N I A' Courtesy Photo\n\n5. Folie a Deux (2008)\n\nLike many FOB records, Folie a Deux begins in rather epic fashion with the oddly named track \u201cDisloyal Order of Water Buffaloes.\u201d After igniting the fire with the first song, they keep up that kind of gusto throughout the entire 13-song track list, with the heavily drum-based, anthemic \u201cCoffee for Closers\u201d and lively Brendon Urie-assisted \u201c20 Dollar Nose Bleed\u201d serving as monumental moments. This album seemed to incorporate more pop influence than the group\u2019s three preceding albums, which didn\u2019t necessarily serve them wrong \u2014 it just made longtime fans a little more weary of Folie a Deux, which in turn made the album (barely) not quite as likable as the ones that came before it.\n\nFall Out Boy, 'Folie a Deux' Courtesy Photo\n\n4. Save Rock And Roll (2013)\n\nIf there is one way to tell the world \u201cwe\u2019re back,\u201d Fall Out Boy found the most bone-chilling way to do so with \u201cMy Songs Know What You Did In the Dark (Light \u2018Em Up).\u201d They hadn\u2019t released any new music for nearly five years when they dropped the single, but the adrenaline-pumping song was just about the most epic way to welcome themselves back into the rock world. But that\u2019s just one of the many tracks that proved that Fall Out Boy\u2019s five-year hiatus didn\u2019t have a negative impact on the kind of music they can create \u2014 in fact, it basically had the opposite affect. Plus, the album includes perhaps the most iconic collaboration in their discography, teaming up with Elton John for the title track. When it comes down to it, the only thing really missing from Save Rock And Roll is the lengthy nonsense titles, which is perhaps the album\u2019s only true downfall.\n\nFall Out Boy, 'Save Rock And Roll' Courtesy Photo\n\n3. Infinity on High (2007)\n\nWith a debut and sophomore album that struck a chord the way that Take This To Your Grave and From Under the Cork Tree did, Fall Out Boy put themselves in quite the tough position when it came to putting out a quality third album. But rather than proving that they couldn\u2019t measure up to their initial releases, the FOB guys established that they were here to stay in the rock realm, putting out a third record that utilized their masterful songwriting and rock influences while also incorporating the poppier sounds of the time. And if (for some reason) you don\u2019t like the album as a whole, \u201cThnks fr th Mrmrs,\u201d \u201cThis Ain\u2019t A Scene, It\u2019s An Arms Race\u201d and \u201cThriller\u201d should be enough to convince you that it\u2019s a pretty damn great third effort.\n\nFall Out Boy, 'Infinity on High' Courtesy Photo\n\n2. Take This To Your Grave (2003)\n\nNewer Fall Out Boy fans may not prefer the grungier, more garage band-like sound that the band had in their early days. To those fans who have been around since 2003, though, Take This To Your Grave is probably the FOB album held closest to their hearts. Not only is it home to classics \u201cGrand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy\u201d and \u201cSaturday,\u201d but it introduced Fall Out Boy as a band who did what they wanted and said what they wanted with their music (for instance, the verse, \u201cLet\u2019s play this game called when you catch fire I wouldn\u2019t piss to put you out\u201d). Take This To Your Grave is one of those records that, even if the original fans aren\u2019t into how FOB\u2019s sound has evolved since, giving it a spin in 2017 brings them right back to \u201903.\n\nFall Out Boy, 'Take This To Your Grave' Courtesy Photo\n\n1. From Under the Cork Tree (2005)\n\nFall Out Boy\u2019s IDGAF mentality was perhaps most prevalent on this record, with lyrics like \u201cI\u2019ll keep singing this lie if you\u2019ll keep believing it\u201d and ridiculously long song titles that really don\u2019t make any sense at all (ahem, \u201cI\u2019ve Got A Dark Alley and a Bad Idea That Says You Should Shut Your Mouth\u201d). It\u2019s that kind of defiance that makes From Under the Cork Tree so memorable, along with the fact that every song is about as quintessential Fall Out Boy as you can get. The heavy guitar, occasional Pete Wentz screams, almost poetically written verses\u2026 every element makes it by far the most classic Fall Out Boy album to date. It was iconic from the second it was released in 2005, but 12 years later, the album is now one of the best servings of pop-punk nostalgia a fan of the genre will ever have."}, {"url":

He never stops his virtuoso thumb-typing, even when he\u2019s rehearsing for a Letterman appearance: As the rest of the band \u2013 singer Patrick Stump, lead guitarist Joe Trohman and drummer Andy Hurley \u2013 fools around with a tricky riff from Steely Dan\u2019s \u201cReeling in the Years\u201d on the Ed Sullivan Theater\u2019s fabled stage, Wentz ignores the black-and-red bass guitar hanging at his tiny waist and texts away instead.\n\nBut at the moment, as our cab cruises past Manhattan\u2019s Union Square around midnight on an arctic Sunday in early February, Wentz is simply using the Sidekick as a phone. And he is pissed. \u201cNo, this is Pete,\u201d he yells into it. \u201cYou called me. And before you said you were going back to your apartment! Where are you? Who the fuck are you with?\u201d With his cushioned lips curling in anger over gleaming teeth, and his glossy black hair rising from his head in exclamation-point spikes, he looks like an anime version of Elvis Presley.\n\nTwenty-four hours from now, Fall Out Boy will release their second major-label album, Infinity on High, the follow-up to one of the decade\u2019s biggest rock hits. With its two impeccable pop-punk singles, \u201cSugar, We\u2019re Goin Down\u201d and \u201cDance, Dance,\u201d 2005\u2019s From Under the Cork Tree pushed the geeky, suburban foursome from Warped Tour stages to what\u2019s left of the MTV mainstream, selling more than 2.5 million copies to kids unaccustomed to paying for music. And with Infinity \u2013 which moves into one glossy anthem after another \u2013 the band is targeting superstardom. \u201cI want to be the biggest band on the planet,\u201d says Wentz, whose overstuffed lyrics pair a maturing verbal gift with an adolescent penchant for self-mythologizing \u2013 he hails his \u201ccar-crash heart\u201d on Infinity\u2019s opening track.\n\nVideo: Fall Out Boy at the VMAs\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nStump, whose voice is as pretty as Pete\u2019s bone structure, writes the high-glucose melodies. But Wentz is the de facto frontman, a MySpace hero to a legion of eyeliner-hoarding emo kids. Wentz, who has a Michael Jackson-like penchant for comparing himself to Peter Pan, is a new, more accessible breed of rock star, keeping in close contact with an Internet tribe of lost boys. (And girls. Lots of girls.) On his band\u2019s Web site, he regularly answers their questions: \u201cPete! My dog died yesterday of cancer. Has this ever happened to you?\u201d\n\nWentz is twenty-seven years old, but until last year he lived in his parents\u2019 house in the upscale Chicago suburb of Wilmette. When not touring, he slept in his childhood bedroom, surrounded by his old Transformers and He-Man toys. While the rest of the band maintains homes in and around Chicago \u2013 where they all have roots in the local hardcore scene \u2013 Wentz finally moved out six months ago, heading to Los Angeles. Stump has a place out there, too, but it\u2019s Wentz who hangs with Teen Vogue cover-girl types: Lindsay Lohan, Ashlee Simpson, Michelle Trachtenberg. \u201cI\u2019m attracted to creative people and train wrecks, and there\u2019s no shortage of that in Los Angeles,\u201d Wentz says. He hints at some sort of fling with Trachtenberg, but insists the other two relationships are platonic. \u201cMaybe in a different universe, we\u2019d be some hot couple, but not in this one,\u201d he says of Simpson. (Wentz may have his universes confused: At a Grammy party, he was filmed walking hand in hand with Simpson.)\n\nBack in the cab, Wentz ends his call and retreats into the hood of his sweat shirt. Before the phone buzzed, he had been in an ebullient mood, recounting an encounter at an ultra-exclusive karaoke night at Cipriani\u2019s in SoHo, which we had just left, and which was packed with models at the start of New York\u2019s Fashion Week. \u201cThis weird blond chick rolls up on me and goes, \u2018Great to see you again,\u2019 \u201d Wentz recalls, laughing. \u201cI was like, \u201cWho are you?\u2019 That\u2019s all I need in my life, some model.\u201d\n\nFall Out Boy Uncensored: The Exclusive Video\n\nWentz has an excuse for hanging out with fashionistas: Biting hip-hop\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit, he has two profitable side hustles. His clothing line, Clandestine Industries, has just signed a production and distribution deal with DKNY. His record label, Decaydance, has FOB-influenced teen faves Panic! at the Disco on its roster. So even as that band threatens to match FOB\u2019s popularity, it\u2019s also making Wentz richer: It\u2019s as if Pearl Jam had owned stock in Stone Temple Pilots.\n\nSee Also\n\nAs the taxi speeds uptown, Wentz is silent, lost in bleak thoughts. When he unleashes one of his broad, dimpled smiles, the force of his alpha-male charisma is almost blinding \u2013 but his sudden shifts into black moods are just as intense. \u201cI fully admit that I have a manic personality. I\u2019m either on or I\u2019m off,\u201d says Wentz, who has spoken at length about a 2005 near-suicide attempt. \u201cI have the ability to make a room go cold.\u201d\n\nDirector Alan Ferguson \u2013 who worked on Fall Out Boy\u2019s last few videos, including the self-mocking clip for Infinity\u2019s first single, \u201cThis Ain\u2019t a Scene, It\u2019s an Arms Race\u201d \u2013 has seen Wentz\u2019s volatility up close. \u201cPete is the nicest, most loyal, most giving dude in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also got a dark side that really makes him charismatic.\u201d For the final Cork Tree video, the mini-horror movie \u201cA Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More \u2018Touch Me,\u2019 \u201d Ferguson created a vampire character for Wentz based on his black moods. In the opening scene, Vampire Wentz jumps off a cliff to get away from the rest of the band.\n\nAs the cookie monster-barking vocalist of the metalcore band Arma Angelus, Wentz was already a Chicago hardcore-scene celebrity in 2001, when Fall Out Boy began to take shape. \u201cWe\u2019re all kind of extreme versions of what we were,\u201d says drummer Andy Hurley, an introverted comic-book fan who played with Wentz in both Arma and a band called Racetraitor (the name was intended as an anti-racist statement, for the record). \u201cPete may go to hot-spot clubs now, but he was hanging out with A-list hardcore dudes back then. He was obviously the dude you want to know, such a magnetic personality.\u201d\n\nFuture FOB guitarist Joe Trohman toured on bass with Arma one summer when he was just sixteen, after Wentz used his considerable powers of persuasion on Trohman\u2019s mom and cardiologist dad. \u201cI definitely got initiated on that tour \u2013 they would rip my underwear off me every day,\u201d Trohman says. \u201cI hated it, dude. I should have stopped wearing underwear.\u201d\n\nAfter that tour, just as Trohman started talking with Wentz about forming a new, poppier, more Green Day-like band, he met a long-sideburned kid his age at a Borders bookstore: Patrick Stump, who was then drumming in a proggy band that sounded like Rush playing emo. Stump wanted to sing and write songs, and Trohman introduced him to Wentz. \u201cI had heard all these legends about Pete Wentz,\u201d says Stump. \u201cThat he was in six bands at once, that he was the world\u2019s greatest Casanova. But when we met, Pete and I looked at each other and went, Who the fuck is this guy? We sucked at first. We were horrible.\u201d They got their name \u2013 a reference to a comic book that Bart reads in The Simpsons \u2013 at random: They asked the crowd at an early gig for suggestions and someone shouted it out. They recorded an entire indie album before they finally got Hurley \u2013 a precision-tooled drummer influenced by Slayer\u2018s Dave Lombardo \u2013 to join the band. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it Fall Out Boy until Andy joined,\u201d says Stump.\n\nOn the first track of the band\u2019s now-disavowed, pre-Hurley debut, 2003\u2019s mostly dreadful Fall Out Boy\u2019s Evening Out With Your Girlfriend, Stump sings, \u201cI got an honorable mention in the movie of my life \u2013 starring you, instead of me.\u201d The singer, who\u2019s sitting at a glass desk in his room in Times Square\u2019s W Hotel, his friendly features cast in shadow by his ever-present baseball cap, nods and half-smiles when I bring up those lines. He wrote them himself, before Wentz took over lyric duty. \u201cI know exactly where you\u2019re going with this \u2013 the whole Pete thing,\u201d he says, glancing out the forty-eighth-floor window. \u201cBut those lines were about how I felt in high school. It didn\u2019t actually refer to Pete, as ironic as it is now.\u201d\n\nFerguson sees the bespectacled Stump as a skilled character actor to Wentz\u2019s leading man. \u201cHe\u2019s my Philip Seymour Hoffman,\u201d he says. Adds Kenneth \u201cBabyface\u201d Edmonds, the unlikely guest producer whom the band recruited to work on two Infinity tracks: \u201cPatrick is one of the baddest dudes I\u2019ve seen in a long time . . . He has a great voice \u2013 very soulful.\u201d But Stump is self-deprecating to the point where you find yourself reassuring him of his charm. \u201cI hear all sorts of things slung at us,\u201d he says, \u201cone of my favorites being the boy-band accusation. I\u2019m like, \u2018Boy band? I\u2019m fat! If we were a boy band, I\u2019d look good, I\u2019d dance and I\u2019d be charming \u2013 so what the fuck are you talking about?\u2019 I write songs, that\u2019s all I do.\u201d\n\nUntil recently, Stump \u2013 who rarely speaks onstage during Fall Out Boy\u2019s infamously sloppy live shows and hardly moves from his microphone stand as Wentz and Trohman bounce around him \u2013 was lost in Wentz\u2019s shadow. But lately, he\u2019s been coming into his own, even producing songs for the Decay-dance alt-hip-hop act Gym Class Heroes \u2013 he sings the Supertramp-derived hook on that act\u2019s \u201cCupid\u2019s Chokehold,\u201d which sits alongside \u201cArms Race\u201d in iTunes\u2019 Top Ten.\n\nOn the hotel-room desk in front of him is a silver laptop armed with Apple\u2019s Garage-Band software, which he uses to record Fall Out Boy demos, hip-hop beats and random experiments. He plays a bunch for me; many of them are startlingly close to the finished songs, and some of the beats sound Hot 97-ready. Two of the funkiest songs on Infinity on High \u2013 \u201cArms Race\u201d and the album closer, \u201cI\u2019ve Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers\u201d \u2013 were originally intended to be hip-hop tracks.\n\nThe day before, Stump met with Jay-Z to play him beats and discuss production projects \u2013 and last year, Jay invited Stump into the studio to write a hook for a Kingdom Come track. \u201cAll of hip-hop showed up \u2013 Jay walks in with Timbaland, then Swizz Beatz walks in. Beyonc\u00e9 was there, doing that dance you see on TV,\u201d says Stump, who was intimidated \u2013 the scene from the \u201cArms Race\u201d video where all the hip-hop dudes laugh at him is inspired by the incident. In real life, Stump never even got behind the microphone. \u201cI had the worst writer\u2019s block,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018I fucked up the Jay-Z thing, so I better write the best fucking Fall Out Boy record ever now.\u201d\u2018\n\nArguably, he did: On Infinity, Fall Out Boy morph beyond the boundaries of their genre to embrace rhythms and vocal inflections that show Stump\u2019s affection for Prince, Zapp and Earth, Wind & Fire. \u201cI was like, \u2018This dude\u2019s got something to prove,\u201d\u2018 says Wentz, whose working relationship with Stump has its tense moments \u2013 the otherwise mild-mannered singer punched him in the face once during an argument over lyrics. \u201cI think he was holding back before, so I just let him put the music where his mouth is \u2013 or the music where my mouth is, maybe.\u201d\n\nEdmonds \u2013 no stranger to love songs \u2013 was struck by Wentz\u2019s achingly personal lyrics, which the bassist said were written about one particular girl. Last year when we first met, Wentz told me the same thing: that many of the new songs he was writing were inspired by a doomed relationship, that the girl in question had driven him so crazy that he\u2019d put his hand through a car window, that he was done with her forever.\n\nIt looks just like a scene from a Fall Out Boy video: Pete Wentz and a striking young woman with a septum piercing and an aloof air stare soulfully at each other as they sit side by side. They look alike, their eyes enshrouded in the same amount of makeup. Wentz occasionally takes her hand, but says nothing. They\u2019re at a Fall Out Boy photo shoot, and the girl looks camera-ready too: Her hair is a punky shade of red, arranged in spikes. She\u2019s wearing knee-high leather boots over strategically torn stockings. Her name is Jeanae. She\u2019s just shy of twenty, a hair-dresser from Chicago. \u201cThis is way more boring than I expected,\u201d she says as flash-bulbs go off. Wentz keeps sending wounded little looks her way \u2013 and seems unnerved when he sees me talking to her.\n\nWentz appears distracted as the shoot continues at a warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, hardly speaking to his bandmates. He does brighten when Stump mentions an obscure Star Wars spinoff: two live-action Ewok TV movies from the mid-Eighties. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to see the second one \u2013 it\u2019s awesome,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, Hurley pauses from a vegan lunch and logs on to MTV\u2019s Web site to see the TRL position of the \u201cArms Race\u201d video. The site promptly crashes his browser, and he goes back to his food.\n\nEventually, everyone piles into a van, headed back into Manhattan. Wentz and Jeanae sit in the last row. The conversation turns to Morrissey, Prince and then Young Jeezy\u2019s new album: Stump hates the rapper\u2019s trademark \u201cha-ha!\u201d laugh, while Trohman \u2013 the only member of the band who drinks and smokes pot \u2013 is a fan. \u201cWe should bring him on tour,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s my dream to smoke weed with that guy.\u201d\n\nWentz and Jeanae seem to be ignoring this discussion. Wentz has the hood of his sweat shirt up, and they\u2019re whispering. Two days later, Wentz will tell me about her, how he can\u2019t let her go, how she\u2019s crazy, how she\u2019s the only girl he really wants. But I\u2019m already starting to get the idea.\n\nPhotos: Fall Out Boy\n\n\n\nTrohman and Hurley get less attention than their bandmates, which can be a source of frustration. \u201cWe mean a lot to each other as musicians and as people,\u201d says Trohman. \u201cBut sometimes we start believing what people write about us: That the band is just one guy or two guys. That can be harsh for the soul.\u201d Trohman\u2019s playing combines heavy-metal riffage with Johnny Marr-inspired atmospherics \u2013 along with high-jumping, headbanging onstage showmanship so intense that he\u2019s given himself shinsplints. \u201cJoe wants to put on a good show,\u201d says Stump. \u201cThere\u2019s a dichotomy there: He wants to be the guitar player where people stand back and say, \u2018Wow, he\u2019s good,\u2019 but at the same time, he can\u2019t help but go ape shit onstage.\u201d Trohman also has a segment of the Fall Out Boy fan base all to himself. \u201cMiddle-aged women love me \u2013 they say I look like Dr. McSexy or whatever his name is,\u201d says the guitarist.\n\nWe\u2019re cabbing over to Rudy\u2019s Music Stop on Forty-eighth Street, where Trohman spots a Fifties Les Paul Junior and inquires about the cost. \u201cEighteen-five \u2013 it\u2019s a good price,\u201d drawls a salesperson.\n\n\u201cDude,\u201d Trohman whispers, \u201cdoes that mean $18,000? That\u2019s a lot of money. Even for me.\u201d We walk out, but then Trohman heads back in to play a gorgeous 1972 black Telecaster. A different salesperson takes him into a back room. \u201cWhat guitar are you playing at home now?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019ve got a whole bunch,\u201d Trohman replies, cranking Metallica riffs through an amplifier. The clerk takes a blind stab: \u201cYou guys in a band or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is,\u201d I say, pointing to Trohman, who\u2019s wearing a Dior hooded sweater over an old Pantera T-shirt.\n\n\u201cOh, yeah? Which band?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called Fall Out Boy,\u201d Trohman says and kicks into the chords of \u201cBack in Black.\u201d The salesman\u2019s eyes light up with dollar signs, and Trohman walks out five minutes later, lugging his new $4,495 impulse purchase in its battered original case. \u2018I\u2019m gonna feel guilty about this for a while,\u2019 he says, looking not at all guilty. \u201cIt\u2019s the Jew in me \u2013 like, \u2018Oh, no, you spent money!\u201d\u2018\n\nAndy Hurley is eating macaroni with vegan cheese and talking about the end of the world. We\u2019re in a cozy East Village vegetarian restaurant, fresh from shopping for comic books at Forbidden Planet. More than anyone in the band, Hurley has stayed closest to his left-wing hardcore roots: Besides his vegan diet, he\u2019s so serious about being straight-edge that he pulls his shirt collar up over his mouth and nose when Trohman smokes pot.\n\nHurley\u2019s father died when he was just five, and he was raised by his mom, a nurse. He was inspired to start drumming by Metallica\u2019s Lars Ulrich: The first albums he bought were Ride the Lightning and Van Halen. \u201cAndy is a musician, he\u2019s the instrumentalist of the band,\u201d says Stump, who as a drummer himself is a tough critic.\n\nHurley \u2013 who lives in Germantown, Wisconsin, about an hour and a half from Chicago \u2013 has some radical political views, part anarchist, part environmentalist. \u201cMy whole thing is I\u2019m not into civilization as a whole,\u201d says Hurley, who\u2019s wearing a Starter-style jacket with the Public Enemy logo on the back. \u201cThe only actual solution is the eventual collapse and demise of civilization . . . I think it needs to happen, but no one, not even me, really wants it to happen.\u201d It\u2019s not that hard for him to reconcile all this with his band\u2019s success. \u201cUltimately I am an employee of a corporation, and that\u2019s weird, and does contradict some of the things I believe in,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the same time, I have to make a living.\u201d\n\nSo will there be rock bands after the collapse of civilization? \u201cProbably not. Music would probably go. A lot of art would,\u201d he says, looking sad for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying \u2013 I\u2019m really into comics and movies and video games, and I don\u2019t want to give that stuff up. At the same time I think it\u2019s filling the void for stuff that we\u2019re missing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Saturday night in Atlantic City, where civilization\u2019s long collapse is clearly under way: Beefed-up dudes in starched, untucked Oxfords are cheering unironically for \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d at a basement club in the Borgata hotel and casino, where Pete Wentz has a DJ gig. Spinning records (or, rather, CDs or MP3s) is a sometime hobby for Wentz, who has previously DJ\u2019d at events such as the New York hipster party MisShapes \u2013 and tonight\u2019s set is a chance to pick up some easy cash and get a comped trip for a posse of friends. Afterward, Wentz wanders through the mazelike casino. \u201cI don\u2019t gamble,\u201d he says, glancing at aisles of frantically buzzing slot machines. \u201cI mean, not with money \u2013 I gamble with my band.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s 3:30 in the morning, and we head up to his hotel room to start an interview. Wentz turns on the TV, which happens to be tuned to a series of alarmist Fox News reports on teens gone wild. He takes off his graffiti-covered white Converse sneakers and sprawls out on one of the beds. I kick off my shoes and hop onto the other one. Wentz \u2013 a chronic insomniac since age ten \u2013 talks with dazed, sleepy honesty.\n\nFirst, he discusses how it felt to have his unit go, um, viral. Last March, some nude self-portraits Wentz had taken spread across the Web. He\u2019s pained by accusations that he deliberately leaked the pics \u2013 and is pretty sure that someone hacked into the backup Web site for his Sidekick. He was driving in Chicago when he heard the news, and he became so distracted that he ran into the car ahead of him. \u201cI thought it was the end of the world,\u201d he says. But he now laughs off the incident. Mostly. \u201cI had dreams that it didn\u2019t happen, that it was all a joke, and then you wake up and have that sick feeling in your stomach, because it did.\u201d\n\nWentz, the child of a law-school professor dad and a private-school admissions-dean mom, had always presented his childhood as idyllic and uneventful. When pressed, he touches on a couple of traumatic events. The first is relatively trivial: \u201cMy parents separated on my birthday when I was, like, six, and got back together about six or eight months later. That made me hate my birthday. I mean, Patrick\u2019s parents are divorced, and Andy\u2019s dad has passed away, so I don\u2019t really think of myself in terms of really having a fucked-up childhood \u2013 everyone I know had a more fucked-up one.\u201d\n\nWentz, who\u2019s wearing a brown-and-black vintage hoodie and untapered, regular-guy Diesel jeans, nervously slides the battery cover of the TV remote control and moves on to a later trauma: \u201cWhen I was fourteen, I got sent to boot camp,\u201d he says, gazing at the ceiling. He had been skipping school regularly in his freshman year, and a guidance counselor persuaded his parents to send him to a tough-love, scared-straight sleep-away program. For eight long weeks. \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Wentz says softly. \u201cEvery kid there was so much more fucked up than me \u2013 demented, satanic kids. I got beat up a couple of times. I\u2019d call my parents every day, crying and saying I wanted to come home. I would beg. I felt isolated. It created these dependency and attachment issues.\u201d\n\nAnd then you ended up living at home . . . Wentz nods. \u201cUntil age twenty-seven. Yeah. Even now I need maternal people in my life more than anything,\u201d he says. He traces many of his emotional problems \u2013 and his artistic drive \u2013 back to the boot-camp experience. \u201cThat was the point I stopped talking to anybody. I really haven\u2019t since then. I don\u2019t talk to people about my emotions \u2013 it\u2019s not pleasant to be in a relationship with someone who\u2019s robotic like that. And if I don\u2019t get the emotions out somehow, whether it\u2019s punching things or writing, I would probably explode.\u201d\n\nThe reason Wentz finally moved out of his parents\u2019 house was to get away from Jeanae, his sulky teenage muse. \u201cThere was bad stuff between us, bad blood,\u201d he says. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the few people who can actually get to me. One day I was just like. \u2018I\u2019m leaving,\u2019 and I took a plane.\u201d But now you\u2019re back together? \u201cShe\u2019s irresistible, I guess. The best ones are crazy, for sure . . . There are parts of me that are like, \u2018Yeah, we could get married,\u2019 but there are parts of me that couldn\u2019t spend tonight with her.\u201d\n\nWentz, who has never had trouble attracting female attention, seems enthralled by Jeanae\u2019s relative indifference \u2013 she\u2019s even unimpressed by the songs he writes about her. \u201cI don\u2019t know that she cares about the songs as much as everybody else who listens to them does,\u201d he says. He seems half-asleep, his eyelids drifting down. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I could write them if she cared that much. If you could ever explain yourself to somebody, why would you keep explaining again and again?\u201d He shows me half-moon scars on the knuckles of both hands \u2013 he\u2019s put each of them through windows during fights with her. \u201cYou watch Walk the Line and you don\u2019t feel so bad. Everyone\u2019s got a bit of a crazy spirit in them. I\u2019m not interested in other people. There could be a million girls and it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\n\nI look at the clock: It\u2019s six in the morning. I head to my own room and pass out. Wentz stays up watching TV, and gets two hours of sleep. It\u2019s not unusual for him.\n\nWe continue talking two nights later back in his Ritz-Carlton hotel room on Central Park South \u2013 which is a mess, with sweat shirts exploding all over the floor from his leather Louis Vuitton suitcase. Amid the clothes is a copy of Kafka\u2019s The Metamorphosis and Other Stories. He loves the hotel, especially since room service has been willing to bring him peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches each night.\n\nIn recent months, Wentz has dropped some of the signature looks that have become emo clich\u00e9s: He doesn\u2019t put on eye-liner much anymore, and he\u2019s moved away from tight girls\u2019 jeans. \u201cAll of a sudden you see the laughability of swished-over hair and eye makeup,\u201d he says, perched on the hotel bed. \u201cNew metal had its look, and Seattle had flannel shirts. It\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\nWentz was a soccer jock when he started playing music. \u201cI used to get made fun of for being, like, your typical dude,\u201d he says. \u201cSo sometimes I tried to look strange. I wanted to look androgynous, weird.\u201d Wentz\u2019s five-foot-seven physique is boyish enough to fit comfortably in the girls\u2019 jeans that he\u2019s helped popularize for guys \u2013 a style choice that was also big in early-Nineties hardcore. But the look has become so popular that the emo masses are all but starving themselves to squeeze in \u2013 prompting this magazine to coin the term \u201cemorexia.\u201d And Wentz is sick of it. \u201cIt definitely got ridiculous, where we were painting on our pants, pretty much,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m over that thing.\u201d\n\nInstead, Wentz has been engaging in the least emo of all activities lately: He\u2019s been lifting weights. \u201cI\u2019ve been working out. Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m going to get buff. I want to be, like, a man now.\u201d Pete Wentz, king of the lost boys, flashes one of his killer smiles and repeats himself: \u201cI want to be a man.\u201d\n\nThis story is from the March 8th, 2007 issue of Rolling Stone."}, {"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/infinity-on-high-fall-out-boy-album/", "page_content": "Cover: Courtesy of Island Def Jam Music Group\n\nFall Out Boy made a rapid transition to the mainstream when their second album, From Under The Cork Tree, debuted at No.9 on the Billboard 200 in May 2005. Yet the band held their heads and while \u2026 Cork Tree won them Grammy nominations and an MTV Music Video Award, creating their third album, Infinity On High, remained their primary focus during 2006.\n\nListen to Infinity On High on Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nDespite their relentless touring schedule, the young Chicagoan alt.rockers constantly worked up fresh material and their graft bore fruit. Indeed, they assembled an impressive stack of new tracks which they arranged with \u2026 Cork Tree producer Neal Avron during six weeks of intensive rehearsals prior to album sessions in LA during the summer of 2006.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely writing all the time,\u201d the band\u2019s bassist and primary lyricist, Pete Wentz, confirmed for VH1 during this period. \u201cThat\u2019s part of what\u2019s been wrong with the rock industry \u2013 bands go away and disappear off the face of the planet. That\u2019s not going to be for Fall Out Boy!\u201d\n\nA confident band\n\nGuitarist/vocalist Patrick Stump also revealed the band could handle the pressure of following up the double-platinum-selling From Under The Cork Tree in a Gibson Guitars interview. \u201cThe second you worry about other peoples\u2019 expectations, you can expect failure,\u201d he said. \u201cNot that we don\u2019t have big hopes for this album \u2013 we want our fans to love it more than anything. But you can\u2019t sit around second-guessing everything \u2013 you make sterile music that way.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Fall Out Boy were brimming with confidence when they entered the studio. Three months later, when they emerged with Infinity On High, they were clutching an impressively diverse record which also harbored several high-profile collaborations. The adrenalized opening cut, \u201cThriller,\u201d included a spoken-word introduction from iconic rapper Jay Z, while the lush, cinematic pop of \u201cThnks Fr Th Mmrs\u201d was overseen by Grammy-winning producer Babyface, and Panic! At The Disco\u2019s Ryan Ross added an expressive guitar solo to the strutting, \u201cRebel Rebel\u201d-esque \u201cThe Take Over, The Breaks Over.\u201d\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nInfinity On High was trailed by the crunching punk-pop nugget \u201cThe Carpal Tunnel Of Love,\u201d but its second single represented another significant stylistic departure. \u201cThis Ain\u2019t A Scene, It\u2019s An Arms Race\u201d reflected the band\u2019s collective love of 70s funk and disco, though the song\u2019s quintessentially anthemic chorus further supplemented its radio-friendly appeal and it shot to No.2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 2007. Boosted by a promotional video starring Kim Kardashian, the swift follow-up, \u201cThnks Fr Th Mmrs,\u201d also charted highly in the US, where it peaked at No.11 in March 2007.\n\nA shamelessly melodic record\n\nSandwiched between the two single releases, Infinity On High was released on February 6, 2007, shot to No.1 on the Billboard chart, and continued to bolster the band\u2019s international reputation. Indeed, the Illinois boys\u2019 steadily rising profile also guided the album to the top of the UK Top 40 and into the Top 5 in Australia, where Infinity On High eventually went double-platinum. For the most part, the critics were bowled over, too, with Billboard dubbing it \u201ca shamelessly melodic, wild and powerful pop record\u201d and Entertainment Weekly commending Fall Out Boy for \u201ctheir sense of swing\u201d in incorporating R&B influences into their pop-punk sound.\n\n\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAs for the band, they were especially gratified that fans and press alike had picked up on Infinity On High\u2019s eclectic spread of material.\n\n\u201cBending genres is very exciting to me,\u201d Patrick Stump revealed. \u201cI think we\u2019re at a time like the [late] 70s, where New Wave bands like Blondie incorporated disco into their music, messing up peoples\u2019 minds\u2026 If Fall Out Boy can be a genre-defying band, then so be it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re aiming for!\u201d\n\nInfinity On High can be bought here."}, {"url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/fall-out-boy-to-save-rock-and-roll-in-may-1537641/", "page_content": "Fall Out Boy is a band on a mission\u2026 to \u201cSave Rock and Roll,\u201d the title of the pop-punk group\u2019s first album in over four years, it was announced Monday morning in Chicago.\n\n\u201cSave Rock and Roll\u201d will be released May 7, but the album\u2019s first single, \u201cMy Songs Know What You Did in the Dark,\u201d hits iTunes today.
