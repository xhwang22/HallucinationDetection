They started life in the late 1990s at Bartholomew School in Eynsham, with Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (then on guitar) writing songs then recruiting a drummer and bass player through an ad. They played their first gig in early 1999 and fired the bass player a few months later, with Ben Thomas switching from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, Perrier and Thomas' dissatisfaction with their drummer led to his departure, with Thomas switching from bass to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece. Winnebago Deal now consists of two Bens, Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums).\n\nWinnebago Deal generated strong support from many appearances at Oxford's Zodiac club, eventually supporting Fugazi at London's Forum; this led to their first record, the Plata O Plomo EP in 2003. They were nominated for the Kerrang Award's 'Best British Newcomer' that year. Soon after, the band signed a recording contract with Double Dragon Music, and produced their debut album Dead Gone with Jack Endino, producer of the first Nirvana album Bleach. Dead Gone was released in September 2004. Plata O Plomo was reissued in Australia later that year, with an expanded track listing.\n\nThe \"two Bens\" then went on to play as Mondo Generator with Nick Oliveri, former Queens of the Stone Age bassist\u2013vocalist. As well as playing Mondo Generator gigs, they still toured as Winnebago Deal and even supported Mondo Generator, earning them the moniker \"Winnebago Generator\" from fans. After recording tracks at Dave Grohl's Studio 606 for the next Mondo Generator album with producer Nick Raskulinecz, it was announced in July 2006 that they had left the band for \"undisclosed reasons\".\n\nIn that same month they released their second full-length album Flight Of The Raven, with the band again choosing to record with producer Jack Endino. The album features guest appearances from other artists including band partner Nick Oliveri, Endino, Paul Morrill and Edward \"Raven\" Heaton from the band Sicarios, and Rusty Needles of Oxford band Deguello, and was cited as the sixth best album in 2006 by Kerrang! writer Raziq Rauf.\n\nWinnebago Deal's third full-length album, \"Career Suicide\", was recorded in November 2009 and released a year later."}, {"url": "https://winnebago.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/winnebago-industries-announces-strong-fourth-quarter-and-full", "page_content": "-- RV Market Share Gains Continue --\n\n-- Quarterly Revenues Up 39.1% Year-Over-Year, Driven by Strong End Consumer Demand --\n\n-- Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Expansion of 90 Basis Points --\n\n-- Reported Quarterly Diluted EPS of $1.25 ; Adjusted EPS of $1.45 Up 45.0% Over Prior Year --\n\n-- Cash Flow From Operations of $270.4 million for the Fiscal Year Up 102.2% Over Prior Year --\n\nFOREST CITY, Iowa , Oct. 21, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Winnebago Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WGO), a leading outdoor lifestyle product manufacturer, today reported financial results for the Company's fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2020.\n\nFourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Results\n\nRevenues for the Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter ended August 29, 2020 , were $737.8 million , an increase of 39.1% compared to $530.4 million for the Fiscal 2019 period. Revenues for Newmar , which was acquired in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, were $126.3 million . Revenues excluding Newmar were $611.5 million , reflecting an organic increase of 15.3% compared to the Fiscal 2019 period primarily driven by growth in the Towable segment. Gross profit was $122.5 million compared to $83.2 million for the Fiscal 2019 period. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points in the quarter, driven by Motorhome segment lower input costs and Towable segment fixed cost leverage, partially offset by segment mix. Operating income was $68.4 million for the quarter, an increase of 52.8% compared to $44.8 million for the fourth quarter last year, driven by Towable segment revenue growth and the addition of Newmar . Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter net income was $42.5 million , an increase of 33.2% compared to $31.9 million in the fourth quarter of last year, driven by the growth in operating income partially offset by increased interest expense. The increase in interest expense is related to the convertible bond issued to finance the acquisition of Newmar , and separately, the write-off of certain debt issuance costs associated with the termination of the company's Term Loan B which was refinanced by a bond issuance during the quarter. Earnings per diluted share was $1.25 , an increase of 23.8% compared to $1.01 in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.45 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 45.0% compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.00 in the same period last year. Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share excludes costs totaling $6.6 million , or $0.20 per diluted share, after tax, driven by debt issuance costs written off due to the termination of the Term Loan B, and the non-cash portion of interest expense related to the convertible bond. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $76.5 million for the quarter, compared to $50.8 million last year, representing an increase of 50.5%.\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Michael Happe commented, \u201cIn the face of the unprecedented impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our strong fourth quarter finish to the year was a testament to the incredible resolve of our world-class team, the strength of our portfolio of leading outdoor lifestyle brands, and our efficiency in quickly and safely resuming operations to meet tremendous consumer demand. We added motorized scale through the acquisition of Newmar and continued to grow our RV market share throughout the year by leveraging strong dealer relationships, exciting new products and record consumer interest. Winnebago Industries also generated expanded margins and stronger cash flows, while delivering a quality product and customer experience in collaboration with our channel partners. Looking ahead, we enter our 2021 fiscal year with four premier brand platforms, strong operational momentum, a record backlog, and the financial flexibility to manage through the ongoing uncertainty in the environment. Our efforts continue to rally around building an extraordinary outdoor lifestyle company, and creating value for our end customers, dealers, employees and shareholders. I want to thank all of our Winnebago Industries employees for their resilience and commitment during these unique times and focusing on giving our customers a safe and memorable experience with our products in the outdoors.\"\n\nFull Year Fiscal 2020 Results\n\nFiscal 2020 revenues of $2.4 billion increased 18.6% from $2.0 billion in Fiscal 2019. Revenues for Newmar , which was acquired in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, were $388.4 million . Revenues excluding Newmar were $2.0 billion , roughly flat with Fiscal 2019 as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related suspension of manufacturing operations during the Fiscal 2020 third quarter and disruptions across the dealer network, supply chain, and end consumers. Gross profit margin decreased 220 basis points, primarily due to the mix impact of adding Newmar as well as the related purchase accounting impacts, and the impact of COVID-19 during the fiscal third quarter. Operating income was $113.8 million for Fiscal 2020, compared to $155.3 million in Fiscal 2019. Net income for Fiscal 2020 was $61.4 million , a decrease of 45.0% compared to $111.8 million in Fiscal 2019 due to the impact of COVID-19 and increased interest expense. The increase in interest expense is related to the convertible bond issued to finance the acquisition of Newmar , and separately, the write-off of certain debt issuance costs associated with the termination of the company's Term Loan B which was refinanced by a bond issuance during the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2020 earnings per diluted share was $1.84 , a decrease of 47.7% compared to earnings per diluted share of $3.52 in Fiscal 2019. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was $2.58 for Fiscal 2020, compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of $3.45 in the same period last year. Fiscal 2020 consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share excludes costs totaling $25.0 million , or $0.75 per diluted share, after tax, related to the non-cash portion of interest expense associated with the convertible bond, Newmar acquisition-related costs, debt issuance costs written off due to the termination of the Term Loan B and restructuring costs. Adjusted earnings per diluted share was also impacted by the share consideration issued in the Newmar acquisition. Fiscal 2020 consolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $168.1 million , a decrease of 6.4% from $179.7 million in Fiscal 2019.\n\nTowable Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2020 Results\n\nRevenues for the Towable segment were $414.0 million for the fourth quarter, up 34.8% over the prior year, primarily driven by strong consumer demand for outdoor experiences, particularly in Grand Design products. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $61.3 million , up 45.8% over the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.8% increased 110 basis points, primarily due to leverage, but also benefiting from profitability initiatives. Backlog increased to a record $747.9 million , up 219.2% over the prior year, as dealers have experienced sizable reductions to their inventory as they have encountered extremely high levels of consumer demand in the fourth quarter.\n\nFor the full year Fiscal 2020, revenues for the Towable segment were $1.23 billion , up 2.5% from Fiscal 2019. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $148.3 million , down 9.4% from Fiscal 2019 driven by the impact of COVID-19 during the Fiscal 2020 third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.1% decreased 160 basis points for the full year.\n\nMotorhome Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2020 Results\n\nIn the fourth quarter, revenues for the Motorhome segment were $301.8 million , up 50.4% from the prior year, driven by the addition of Newmar . Revenues excluding Newmar were $175.5 million , down 12.6%, as strong class B sales were more than offset by sales declines in class A and class C. Segment Adjusted EBITDA was $19.5 million , up 81.2% from the prior year due to improved profitability in the Winnebago branded business and the addition of Newmar , partially offset by the organic revenue decline and class mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 6.4% increased 100 basis points. Backlog increased to a record $1.1 billion , up 535.8% over the prior year, reflecting extremely high levels of consumer demand.\n\nFor the full year Fiscal 2020, revenues for the Motorhome segment were $1.1 billion , up 49.5% from Fiscal 2019. Revenues excluding Newmar were $668.4 million , down 5.4% from Fiscal 2019, as a result of manufacturing and distribution disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $32.9 million , up 20.0% from Fiscal 2019 driven by the addition of Newmar partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 during the Fiscal 2020 third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 3.1% was down 80 basis points for the full year due to the impact of COVID-19 during the Fiscal 2020 third quarter partially offset by the addition of Newmar .\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\n\nAs of August 29, 2020 , the Company had total outstanding debt of $512.6 million ( $600.0 million of debt, net of convertible note discount of $74.3 million , and net of debt issuance costs of $13.1 million ) and working capital of $413.2 million . Cash flow from operations was $270.4 million for the full year Fiscal 2020, resulting in an increase of $136.7 million , or 102.2%, from the $133.8 million generated in Fiscal 2019.\n\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\n\nOn August 19, 2020 , the Company\u2019s board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share payable on September 30, 2020 , to common stockholders of record at the close of business on September 16, 2020 . This represents a 9% increase from the prior dividend of $0.11 per share.\n\nMr. Happe continued, \u201cAs we look ahead to Fiscal 2021, we are encouraged by the ongoing outdoor recreation demand trends we are experiencing. We have built a strong and growing position in the RV market, and our customers continue to view all our brands as a trusted and safe way to have extraordinary experiences as they travel, live, work, and play in the outdoors. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the progress we have made over the last several years expanding Winnebago Industries' portfolio while simultaneously enhancing the quality of our product lineup and service levels and the profitability we are able to achieve. During fiscal year 2020, we continued to expand our family of outstanding brands with the acquisition of Newmar , and when combined with our Winnebago , Grand Design RV, and Chris-Craft brands, we believe we have four of the most respected brands in the outdoors industry. We have expanded our leadership team capabilities as well in the past year, through the acquisition of Newmar and also through adding new talent to the team in Huw Bower to lead our Winnebago Outdoors business, as announced at the end of September. Going forward, we are committed to managing our Company in a highly disciplined fashion so that we are best positioned to build on our momentum in the marketplace, capture the numerous opportunities we believe lie ahead and deliver further value to the customers and communities we serve. Finally, Fiscal 2020 also marks an inflection point in our efforts to improve on our corporate responsibility obligations. It is our strong intention that through these initiatives, our Winnebago Industries team will emerge as an even stronger leader in our communities, and in so doing, will make a meaningful contribution to an improvement in the many dimensions of social justice.\u201d\n\nConference Call\n\nWinnebago Industries, Inc. will discuss fourth quarter and full year Fiscal 2020 earnings results during a conference call scheduled for 9:00 a.m. Central Time today.

Adjusted diluted income per share is defined as income per share adjusted for items that impact the comparability of our results from period to period. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other adjustments made in order to present comparable results from period to period. We believe Adjusted diluted income per share and Adjusted EBITDA provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance because these measures exclude amounts that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. Examples of items excluded from Adjusted income per share include acquisition-related costs, acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up, non-cash interest expense, and the tax impact of the adjustments. Examples of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA include acquisition-related fair-value inventory step-up, acquisition-related costs, restructuring expenses, and non-operating income.\n\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and trends as well as our performance relative to competitors and peers; (b) to measure operational profitability on a consistent basis; (c) in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board of directors to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management in its assessments of performance and in forecasting and budgeting for our company; (d) to evaluate potential acquisitions; and (e) to ensure compliance with restricted activities under the terms of our ABL credit facility and outstanding notes.

Hailing from Oxford, the group began as a quartet however, during 1999. With a sound comparable to classic Sub Pop bands and Queens of the Stone Age (when Nick Oliveri mans the mic), two of the original members exited shortly thereafter, leaving Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums) to fend for themselves. Making a name for themselves the old-fashioned way (touring incessantly via van -- for very little pay -- and handing out demos), the duo eventually began building a loyal following, which led to a gig supporting Fugazi at London's Forum, which in turn got the attention of the head of indie label Fierce Panda Records. This led to the release of the duo's debut EP, Plata O Plomo, in March of 2003, and as a result, racked up accolades (including being nominated 'Best British Newcomer' at that years' Kerrang Awards). 2003 was a busy one for the Ben's, as they played well over a hundred gigs (including a spot at the Reading/Leeds festivals, and playing alongside the likes of Burning Brides and Nebula). Several singles and EP's found their way into the shops during late 2003 and early 2004 -- Manhunt, a split 7\" with tour mates Nebula, and the George Dickel EP, while Winnebago Deal was invited to take part in one XFM and two Radio One sessions. A new recording contract with Double Dragon Music soon followed, as the duo hooked up with renowned Sub Pop producer Jack Endino (best known for working with both Nirvana and Soundgarden early on). The resulting debut full-length, Dead Gone, appeared in September 2004, which was prefaced by a few gigs supporting Mondo Generator. A month after their debut's release, Plata O Plomo was reissued in Australia, with an expanded track listing.\n\n\u00a9 Greg Prato /TiVo\n\nRead more"}, {"url": "https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/winnebago-deal-flight-of-the-raven", "page_content": "Album Reviews\n\nWinnebago Deal \u2013 Flight Of The Raven (Fierce Panda) UK release date: 10 July 2006\n\nWhen a band describes themselves as AC/DC meets Black Flag you know they are either ridiculously deluded or, as is the case with Oxford duo Winnebago Deal, that they have spent their entire youths holed up in dank rehearsal rooms, consuming, digesting and emulating their rock god heroes; earning their right to spew forth their very own brand of pedal-to-the-metal, punk-infused rock and roll.\n\nConsisting of two men named, uh Ben, Winnebago Deal have been touring constantly for the past six years; building a fan base where none existed often through sheer repetitive effort; playing venues that most bands would turn down; and touring in a van packed so tightly that mere accessories like bass players and their equipment have had to be dismissed along the way. Although, as two pieces go, these boys make The White Stripes look like purveyors of stagnant nursery rhymes.\n\nFlight Of The Raven is their second full-length album, released on renowned indie label Fierce Panda. Opener With Friends Like These sets the tone for an album of stoner-influenced, punk-paced drinking tunes that will never make it to radio but, thanks to the boys\u2019 commitment to relentless touring, should still be coming to a town near you.\n\nFuture single Spider Bite starts with a muted, rolling riff that is unleashed into a thrashing tub-thumping rock number, complete with Hellacopters piano lick in the mid-section and the gruffest vocals you will hear on a song about spiders, ever. Reeper, meanwhile, is a slice of Fu Manchu in their early days with Cathedral\u2018s Lee Dorrian on vocal duties, tearing through their balls-out rock and roll by-numbers tune with style.\n\nVenomised sees the velocity slowed way down for a crushing horror groove that grinds its way through three minutes of feedback-laced lead lines and whispered female backing vocals. A Dose Of Something is just what the doctor ordered, back firmly in late \u201990s stoner territory, and makes it clear to see why this band have supported Nebula on numerous occasions. The title track features some of the rawest vocals you will ever hear, and follower You Let Me Down will have you scratching your head as to just how two instruments can make this much noise.\n\nWhile some rock bands seek to take their influences and set about trying to forge an as yet undiscovered musical mastery, there are others who simply reproduce their heroes\u2019 chords in a different order and make a packet on the back of someone else\u2019s creativity. Thankfully Winnebago Deal turn the latter position on its head, where they are only too happy to pay constant homage to their inspiration. You can barely find an interview where the lads aren\u2019t shouting about Melvins or Black Flag; and it\u2019s because of this that the blistering live duo will gain respect enough to negate what they\u2019re lacking in originality and hopefully win some fans en route."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/winnebago-deal-mn0000904976", "page_content": "Winnebago Deal Follow Artist +\n\nThe early 21st century may be remembered as the rock era when bands began 'downsizing' the amount of bandmembers, A plethora of duos appeared during this time (who handled all the chores themselves),\u2026\n\nRead Full Biography"}, {"url": "https://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Winnebago-Deal/5225/", "page_content": "Winnebago Deal Rock (1 votes) Alternative Rock Ambient Americana Art Pop Atmospheric Black Metal Black Metal Bluegrass Blues Bossa Nova Breaks Britpop Classical Country Death Metal Deathcore Disco Djent Doom Metal Downtempo Dream Pop Drone Drum and Bass Dubstep Electronic Emo Experimental Folk Folk Punk Funeral Doom Funk Garage Glam Rock Gothic Grime Grind Groove Metal Grunge Hard Rock Hardcore Heavy Metal Hip-Hop House IDM Indie Folk Indie Pop Indie Rock Industrial Instrumental Hip-Hop Jam Rock Jazz Jazz Fusion Lo-fi Math Rock Mathcore Melodic Black Metal Melodic Death Metal Metal Metalcore Minimal New Age New Wave Noise Noise Rock Nu Jazz Nu-metal Pop Pop Punk Pop Rock Post Hardcore Post Metal Post Punk Post Rock Power Electronics Power Metal Progressive Metal Progressive Rock Psychedelic Punk R&B Reggae Rock Shoegaze Ska Sludge Metal Soul Soundtrack Stoner Rock Synthpop Techno Thrash Metal Trance Trip Hop\n\nWinnebago Deal started life as a four piece band in 1999 at Bartholomew School, in Eynsham (Oxford), though two of the original members left shortly after.
