{"David Collings was born in London.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/26/david-collings-obituary", "page_content": "After a spectacular start to his television career in the 1960s, when he played leading roles in two classics by Dostoevsky, the actor David Collings, who has died aged 79, became a cult favourite of sci-fi fans with weird appearances in UFO (produced by the Thunderbirds team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson), three Doctor Who sagas and the 1979 supernatural detective series Sapphire and Steel, co-starring Joanna Lumley and David McCallum.\n\nAlthough he started out on the stage, Collings did not consolidate his reputation there until completing more than a decade of television stardom, after which he was in a string of important roles for the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nAt the Open Air theatre in Regent\u2019s Park he was a genuinely funny Polonius opposite newcomer Damian Lewis\u2019s firebrand Hamlet in 1994, directed by Tim Pigott-Smith; he had first played a tetchy but benignly well-meaning Polonius for an RSC touring production with Philip Franks in 1987.\n\nCollings was a fine featured, red-haired actor with sensitive blue eyes who was equally good at playing neurotic and sweet-natured characters. On television he also ran a good line in eminent characters from history: Percy Grainger in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (1968), Sir Anthony Babington in Elizabeth R (1971), John Ruskin in The Love School (1975), William Wilberforce in The Fight Against Slavery (1975) and William Pitt in Prince Regent (1979).\n\nHe was born in Brighton, East Sussex, to George Collings, a greengrocer, and his wife, Lillian (nee Parsons). At Varndean grammar school he enjoyed acting but had no thoughts of setting out to be a professional actor and, on leaving, started work as a designer in lettering, inheriting that interest from his father, a keen artist. From 1960 he was happily involved in amateur dramatics for the Withdean Players and the Lewes Little theatre, but then was recommended by the actor Freda Dowie to the director David Scase, who had been appointed to run the Liverpool Rep.\n\nAfter six months in rep, Collings found himself pitched into television through another unsolicited recommendation, this time from the actor John Slater, who thought he might be suitable casting in a 1964 Play of the Week presentation of Crime and Punishment. Thus he found himself playing the impoverished tragic hero, Raskolnikov, murderer of an old pawnbroker, in a three-and-a-half hour existential epic alongside Steven Berkoff, Peter Bowles, Julia Foster and Sylvia Coleridge.\n\nFive years later, in 1969, he was in another mighty Dostoevsky production, a BBC version in six episodes of The Possessed, as the charismatic rabble-rouser Pyotr Verkhovensky, alongside Rosalie Crutchley, Joan Hickson and Angela Pleasence. In the same year he was the Clerk in a BBC adaptation in seven long episodes of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, with Barbara Jefford as the Wife of Bath and Barry Linehan as the Miller.\n\nHe made a rare feature movie appearance as a lovable Bob Cratchit in the musical Scrooge (1970), with Albert Finney, in the same year as he was captured by aliens and imbued with superhuman powers in UFO. In Doctor Who he was an alien himself, in a rubber mask, with ideas of blowing up the Cybermen with a home-made rocket in 1975; a robot-phobic, Poul, in a 1977 narrative that found him crawling round the floor and sobbing; and in 1983, Peter Davison having succeeded Tom Baker in the title role, he was mistaken for the good doctor before mutating into a mutant with a wild spaghetti hairstyle.\n\nCollings as Bob Cratchit in the 1970 film Scrooge, with Frances Cuka as his wife. Photograph: Allstar/Waterbury\n\nPausing only to play Legolas in Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio 4 in 1981, and a guest appearance in the final wipe-out episode of Blake\u2019s 7, Collings joined the RSC for the first time as Newman Noggs in the 1985 revival of David Edgar\u2019s Nicholas Nickleby on tour and on Broadway. He also appeared in a star-studded chorus in the fine Don Taylor television script of Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus (1986), with Michael Pennington, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud.\n\nFor the RSC subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, he played Thomas Cranmer in Henry VIII, Baron de Charlus in Tennessee Williams\u2019s Camino Real, Count Lerma in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Sir Politic Would-Be in Ben Jonson\u2019s Volpone, Cardinal Pandulph in King John and Sancho in Lope de Vega\u2019s Madness in Valencia. You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\n\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\n\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola. He was predeceased by Deirdre and two of their children, Matthew and Bethian."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/David_Collings", "page_content": "What we do.

His soulful eyes could ignite vividly on his striking, yet sometimes doleful, countenance - under a lustrous mane of red hair - giving him an enigmatic, otherworldly quality that made him especially useful to science-fiction productions.\n\nAs Silver in the beguiling series Sapphire and Steel (1981-82) he was an eccentric, mercurial foil to David McCallum and Joanna Lumley. A popular contributor to Doctor Who \u2013 memorably guest-starring in three stories between 1975-83 \u2013 his powerful yet nuanced performances helped to ground the fantastical with requisite realism. Actor Mark Gatiss has described him as \u201cthe greatest Doctor Who we never had\u201d; Collings finally got to play his own incarnation of the Time Lord in an audio adventure for Big Finish (2003), capitalising on his vast experience in radio.\n\nIn BBC Radio 4\u2019s epic and strongly cast version of The Lord of the Rings (1981) he played Legolas, and latterly he was the perfect audiobook reader for the haunting stories of MR James.\n\nHis dusky yet melodic voice, perfectly modulated, also adopted an amusingly boorish bravado for the the title character in Monkey (1979-80),the dubbed English language version of the cult Japanese TV series.\n\nDavid Cressy Collings was born in Brighton, the son of a greengrocer. Upon leaving Varndean Grammar School he worked in retail before becoming an apprentice draughtsman at a design practice.\n\nHe joined the amateur company Lewes Little Theatre, partly to help with a speech impediment, and was spotted by actress Freda Dowie, who recommended him to the Liverpool Repertory Theatre. Whilst there the actor John Slater suggested him for a three-hour, live TV production of Crime and Punishment (1964) - and so, at 24 and with no formal training, he played his first leading television role.\n\nMore notable parts followed, in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (as an unforgettable Percy Grainger, 1968), Elizabeth R (1971, with Glenda Jackson), the BBC Shakespeare Julius Caesar (an intense Cassius, 1979), The Prince Regent (as William Pitt, 1979), A Tale of Two Cities (1980), Dark Towers (terrifying a generation of children as Lord Dark, 1981), and Press Gang (1989-93).\n\nHe also guest-starred in most popular series from Z-Cars (1965) to Holby City (2015) via UFO (1970), The Professionals (1978) and Blake\u2019s 7 (1981). On film he was an excellent Bob Cratchit to Albert Finney\u2019s eponymous miser in Scrooge (1970).\n\nHe was a gifted classical stage actor - his Mercutio at St George\u2019s Theatre, Tufnell Park (1976) was, according to Kenneth Branagh, who watched it as a schoolboy, \u201cthrilling\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d.\n\nHe spent several seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company, where his insightful character work benefited several good parts over the decades - a favourite engagement was touring with them from Stratford to Broadway in the 1985 revival of Nicholas Nickleby with his wife, Karen Archer, also in the cast, and their infant twins Samuel and Eliza (both destined to be actors themselves) in tow. He and Samuel also shared the stage in the Manchester Royal Exchange\u2019s 2011 production of Edward II.\n\nHe is survived by Karen, Samuel and Eliza, his sister Nola and step-daughter Juliet and daughter Kate from his earlier marriage, to Deirdre Bromfield.

From 1960 he was happily involved in amateur dramatics for the Withdean Players and the Lewes Little theatre, but then was recommended by the actor Freda Dowie to the director David Scase, who had been appointed to run the Liverpool Rep.\n\nAfter six months in rep, Collings found himself pitched into television through another unsolicited recommendation, this time from the actor John Slater, who thought he might be suitable casting in a 1964 Play of the Week presentation of Crime and Punishment. Thus he found himself playing the impoverished tragic hero, Raskolnikov, murderer of an old pawnbroker, in a three-and-a-half hour existential epic alongside Steven Berkoff, Peter Bowles, Julia Foster and Sylvia Coleridge.\n\nFive years later, in 1969, he was in another mighty Dostoevsky production, a BBC version in six episodes of The Possessed, as the charismatic rabble-rouser Pyotr Verkhovensky, alongside Rosalie Crutchley, Joan Hickson and Angela Pleasence. In the same year he was the Clerk in a BBC adaptation in seven long episodes of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, with Barbara Jefford as the Wife of Bath and Barry Linehan as the Miller.\n\nHe made a rare feature movie appearance as a lovable Bob Cratchit in the musical Scrooge (1970), with Albert Finney, in the same year as he was captured by aliens and imbued with superhuman powers in UFO. In Doctor Who he was an alien himself, in a rubber mask, with ideas of blowing up the Cybermen with a home-made rocket in 1975; a robot-phobic, Poul, in a 1977 narrative that found him crawling round the floor and sobbing; and in 1983, Peter Davison having succeeded Tom Baker in the title role, he was mistaken for the good doctor before mutating into a mutant with a wild spaghetti hairstyle.\n\nCollings as Bob Cratchit in the 1970 film Scrooge, with Frances Cuka as his wife. Photograph: Allstar/Waterbury\n\nPausing only to play Legolas in Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio 4 in 1981, and a guest appearance in the final wipe-out episode of Blake\u2019s 7, Collings joined the RSC for the first time as Newman Noggs in the 1985 revival of David Edgar\u2019s Nicholas Nickleby on tour and on Broadway. He also appeared in a star-studded chorus in the fine Don Taylor television script of Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus (1986), with Michael Pennington, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud.\n\nFor the RSC subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, he played Thomas Cranmer in Henry VIII, Baron de Charlus in Tennessee Williams\u2019s Camino Real, Count Lerma in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Sir Politic Would-Be in Ben Jonson\u2019s Volpone, Cardinal Pandulph in King John and Sancho in Lope de Vega\u2019s Madness in Valencia. You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\n\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\n\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola. He was predeceased by Deirdre and two of their children, Matthew and Bethian."}, {"url": "https://www.rada.ac.uk/", "page_content": "Please help us secure RADA\u2019s future and keep the door open to the next generation of talent.\n\nThe pandemic has had a devastating impact on RADA\u2019s finances and our ability to deliver world-class training.

She joined Emmerdale as the aspiring vet Zoe Tate, whose family moved into Home Farm, in the fictional Yorkshire Dales village of Beckindale, in 1989.\n\nZoe was the daughter of a millionaire haulage firm boss, Frank Tate (Norman Bowler), and stepdaughter of his second wife, Kim (Claire King). Bracknell quickly outgrew life as a satellite character. Zoe took a job at a veterinary practice in the nearby village of Hotton, then left for New Zealand to become a flying vet \u2013 giving Bracknell the first of two maternity-leave breaks from the serial.\n\nOn her return, Zoe eventually set up her own practice. By then, the village had changed its name to Emmerdale and the character had realised that she was not attracted to men. Weathering a string of soap-opera dramas, Bracknell steered Zoe through many relationships, schizophrenia, drink problems, the birth of a daughter after a brief encounter with Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman) and, six years apart, acquittals on charges of murder and attempted murder.\n\nIn 2005, after 16 years in Emmerdale, Bracknell announced she was taking a nine-month break to spend more time with her family and qualify as a teacher of yoga \u2013 which she found helped her to relax and stay calm during her busy schedule. In the event, she never returned to the soap. \u201cI loved playing Zoe but by the time I left she was an emotional wreck,\u201d Bracknell explained later. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure where else I could take her.\u201d\n\nZoe\u2019s final scene \u2013 in which she blew up her family\u2019s former home after being blackmailed into selling it \u2013 was named best exit in the 2006 British Soap awards. More significantly, Bracknell was widely praised for her screen portrayal of an LGBT character \u2013 not \u201chaving to wear a sign around her neck that constantly reinforced her sexuality,\u201d wrote one observer \u2013 although she herself was most proud of the sensitive way in which she tackled Zoe\u2019s mental illness.\n\nIn October 2016, a huge outpouring of generosity followed the actor\u2019s announcement that she had terminal lung cancer. Bracknell launched an appeal to raise \u00a350,000 for treatment in Germany that was not available on the NHS in Britain, and it hit its target within three days. She wrote about her experiences of cancer in a blog, Something Beginning With C.\n\nShe was born in London as Alison Bracknell, the daughter of Li-Er Hwang, a Chinese-Malayan actor, and David Bracknell, an assistant director of feature films. Her father met her mother when he was working on the film The World of Suzie Wong (1960), in which Li-Er appeared as Wednesday Lu. Later, Bracknell adopted the name Leah as an anglicisation of her mother\u2019s name.\n\nShe was brought up in London and Oxford and made her screen debut as a child in four episodes of the Children\u2019s Film Foundation serial The Chiffy Kids (1976-78), directed by her father and screened in cinemas during Saturday matinees.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be an actress from the age of five,\u201d Bracknell told me at the height of her fame in Emmerdale. \u201cI used to hang out with the technicians when my father was making films and inevitably you pick up the whole atmosphere. I spent years bullying him into giving me things to do until he finally let me appear in The Chiffy Kids.\u201d\n\nOn leaving school, Bracknell spent a year in New Zealand during which she visited her father on the set of the 1983 film Savage Islands in Fiji and persuaded him to let her help in the wardrobe department.\n\nBack in Britain, she did modelling and TV commercials, formed a cabaret act with a friend, and trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art in London (1984-87). Stage roles followed with the Oxford Players, Klaxon and Pandemonium theatre companies, and Eastern Actors\u2019 Studio, and there were small parts on television in Cannon & Ball, The Bill and the 1989 TV movie Dealers.\n\nAfter leaving Emmerdale, Bracknell returned to stage work and had TV guest roles in Judge John Deed (2007), Casualty 1907 (2008), A Touch of Frost (2010), Doctors (three characters, 2007-11) and DCI Banks (2011). She was also a regular in the 2008 daytime hospital soap The Royal Today as Jenny Carrington, the no-nonsense matron who ruled the wards with a rod of iron at the fictional St Aidan\u2019s Royal Free hospital, which was also the setting for the peak-time drama The Royal, set in the 1960s.\n\nAlongside teaching yoga and practising shamanic healing, Bracknell established a jewellery collection of her own designs using materials such as glass beads, coral and lacquer, and named after female Shakespeare characters. She donated a percentage of the profits to Wheatfields hospice, Leeds, and the mental health charity Rethink.\n\nBracknell is survived by her husband, Jez Hughes, whom she married in 2017, and by Lily and Maya, the children from her earlier relationship with the director-turned-writer Lyall Watson.\n\nLeah (Alison Rosalind) Bracknell, actor, born 12 July 1964; died 15 September 2019"}]}
