A pitcher for the perennial-contending Fresno State Bulldogs, Southern was a four-time All-American including three first-team honors. She won the WAC Pitcher of the Year award in all four years of her career and was later named to the ESPN All-Decade Softball Team for the 2000s.\n\nBeginning during her career at Fresno State and continuing after it, Southern was part of Team USA. She helped lead the team to a gold medal at the 2006 World Championships and was a #1-overall draft selection to the professional softball league at that time. She was inducted into the Fresno State Hall of Fame in 2012.\n\nTo make the understatement of the year, you could say she was \u201cpretty good\u201d.\n\nSome years after her playing career ended, Southern jumped into the collegiate coaching fray. After spending a stint as volunteer assistant at Abilene Christian, Southern joined the Idaho State staff as an assistant coach this summer. Following her arrival in Pocatello, she talked about her lauded playing career; rejoining the college softball world as a coach; and her style and philosophies between the white lines.\n\n*****\n\nExtra Inning Softball: When did you know that you wanted to pursue a career in college coaching?\n\nJamie Southern: About a year and a half ago, the thought came about, but it wasn\u2019t a good time with my husband\u2019s job as well as COVID shutting down the softball world. This past June, I ran into an old teammate and she put the idea back into my head, so I started to look at which jobs were available.\n\nEIS: Describe your coaching style. What do you feel are your biggest attributes as a coach?\n\nSouthern: My coaching style is based on loving these young ladies first and coaching them second. I have to look at my role as teaching spins and mechanics, preparing them for success on the field and allowing them to continue to grow during their years with me in college. They shouldn\u2019t peak when we recruit them\u2026my job is to get them better! I have three young daughters myself and if/when they go play in college, I would want this for my daughters!\n\nEIS: What is your favorite moment or memory from your softball career to this point?\n\nSouthern: There are so many favorite moments in my career and most are based off of the connections and memories with my teammates. Fighting for wins is such a great feeling and to do it with teammates that I respect and love is even better! But now being in a place where I\u2019m starting the journey with my own children, I find that the best moments are the ones that I got to spend with my dad on the bucket and in the coaching box. My dad and I are already close and to have him be apart of my journey side by side is something that I will cherish forever!\n\nEIS: What were the biggest pieces of knowledge that you gained during your playing career that have benefitted you as a coach?\n\nSouthern: Knowing how to find a way to win! This fall at Idaho State, I have been working with my pitchers on finding ways to win the battle with the batter. Using their individual strengths to be able to beat them. I have been coached by the best coaches of this game and the one thing that they all have in common is the desire to win!\n\nEIS: Tell me about your experience with Team USA and what it was like to wear the red, white, and blue.\n\nSouthern: Representing the USA was one of the biggest highlights of my career. At the start of my softball journey, I had goals of playing at the top levels. It wasn\u2019t until after my freshman year in college that I got my first invitation for the USA tryout and achieved one of my goals. To play on a team with the best in the world and travel the world was such an experience.\n\nEIS: Your trophy case is quite full; two-part question here: Part A, do you have a favorite award that you won? And Part B, how does such a decorated playing career help you guide your student-athletes as a coach?\n\nSouthern: One of the awards that mean something special to me are the two years in college that I had the lowest ERA in the country. Guiding the Idaho State pitchers to come up with their own game plan and strategic workouts will be able to help them in their goals to lower their ERA.\n\nEIS: If we\u2019re having this conversation a year from now, with your first season at ISU under your belt, what needs to have happened for you to be able to say \u2018this has been a successful year\u2019?\n\nSouthern: As the fall is coming to an end, I\u2019m already so proud of the pitching staff as they have more confidence and are excited for this season. But at the end of the year, I would find success in my first year if their strikeouts and ERA have improved from last year. With these improvements, they will have given their team a better chance to win every game."}, {"url": "https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/susan-pedersen", "page_content": "Books\n\nSettler Colonialism in the Twentieth Century: Projects, Practices, Legacies\n\nEleanor Rathbone and the Politics of Conscience\n\nAfter the Victorians: Private Conscience and Public Duty in Modern Britain\n\nFamily, Dependence, and the Origins of the Welfare State: Britain and France, 1914-1945\n\nRecent Scholarly Articles\n\n\u201cGetting out of Iraq \u2013 in 1932: The League of Nations and the Road to Normative Statehood,\u201d American Historical Review, 115: 4 (Oct. 2010), 975-1000.\n\n\u201cThe Impact of League Oversight on British Policy in Palestine,\u201d in Rory Miller, ed., Palestine, Britain and Empire: The Mandate Years (London: Ashgate, 2010), 39-65.\n\n\"Metaphors of the Schoolroom: Women Working the Mandates System of the League of Nations,\" History Workshop Journal 66 (2008), 188-207.\n\n\"Back to the League of Nations: Review Essay,\" American Historical Review, 112: 4 (Oct. 2007), pp. 1091-1117.\n\n\"The Meaning of the Mandates System: An Argument,\" Geschichte und Gesellschaft, 32: 4 (Oct-Dec. 2006), 560-82."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/soccer-womens-world-cup-1999", "page_content": "Soccer: Women's World Cup, 1999\n\nU.S. Women's National Soccer Team (1982\u20132001).

What was expected to be a nice little soccer tournament turned into The Associated Press Story of the Year, a success beyond even what its participants imagined possible.\" How had women's soccer in America emerged from obscurity into a national sensation? The success of the sport in the States had a great deal to do with an exceptional team, the members of which captured the public's imagination with their competitive spirit, celebrity potential, and undisputed ability to deliver the goods on the field.\n\nThe history of the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team began in 1972\u2014ten years before the team was actually established\u2014with the passage of Title IX, the government mandate requiring school sports programs to treat male and female athletes equally. The resulting expansion of women's athletic programs in high schools and colleges fortuitously coincided with an interest in soccer, a sport already well established in European countries but slow to gain a foothold in the United States. Over the next decade, the schools, as well as numerous suburban youth soccer leagues across the country, produced a bumper crop of outstanding young women players, many of whom went on to play on college teams. By 1982, interest was such that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) began a collegiate national championship women's soccer tournament, and that same year the first U.S. women's team was selected to compete in the international arena. Under head coach Anson Dorrance (also the women's soccer coach at the University of North Carolina), and captained by April Heinrichs , the initial team included such players as Michelle Akers, Mia Hamm, Carin Jennings Gabarra , Kristine Lilly, Julie Foudy, and Joy Fawcett, names known only to soccer insiders at the time. The Americans played their first match, a 1\u20130 loss to Italy, in August 1985, with little fanfare. \"We all had a vision for the future,\" says Heinrichs, who went on to become the women's coach at the University of Virginia and with the U.S. U-16 team. \"I didn't think it would become this great, this dominant, this wonderful, but, boy, looking back, it was wonderful.\"\n\nThe national team played its first World Cup match on November 17, 1991, and subsequently won the tournament in the finals against China. \"When we started the team, we never thought there would be a World Cup,\" remarked midfielder Julie Foudy. \"It was always a mystical thing. And now we're holding it.\" Lauren Gregg , the assistant coach of the national team, regarded the '91 tournament as a showcase of the team's uniquely American style of play: \"risk oriented, attacking, playing in a way to make a difference. We were a country that in the eyes of the world shouldn't be winning a World Cup. We upped the ante for the rest of the countries.\"\n\nBut the World Cup victory went virtually unheralded in the United States; some newspapers didn't even note the win. The national team continued to practice and play with little press or recognition until 1994, when the hype surrounding that year's men's World Cup, coupled with the recognition of women's soccer as a medal event in the Olympics, brought the team some well-deserved attention. Magazines began to carry features on some of the players and, lured by the status of the team as an Olympic medal favorite, corporate sponsors began pop-ping up. For the first time, the women were put on salary (hardly comparable to their male counterparts, but a start), and a new training facility in Orlando, Florida, became a priority. With heightened visibility, however, came new challenges. The Olympic decision impacted other countries as well, and they too were giving women's soccer more attention. There were new professional leagues in Sweden, Norway, and Germany, and the competition for the upcoming World Cup promised to be fierce.\n\nSome problems arose within the team's ranks when Coach Dorrance surprised everyone with the announcement that he was stepping down, and team stalwart Michelle Akers, battling Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS), was often unable to play.\n\nUnder new head coach Tony DiCicco, however, the year leading up to the World Cup was a surprisingly good one for the team, and they looked strong going into the 1995 tournament. The players progressed to the semifinal match-up against Norway, their arch rivals since the 1991 Cup finals. The Norwegians played a rough physical game, putting the United States on the defensive at the onset. Ten minutes into the competition, Norway made the first goal, then kept the U.S. at bay for the rest of the game. Michelle Akers, who was playing hurt and managed to get off only one shot, remarked of the devastating defeat: \"It's like having your guts kicked out of you.\"\n\nTo prepare for the upcoming summer Olympics, the team regrouped in Orlando during January 1996 and dedicated themselves to the goal of winning a gold medal. They bonded as a team like never before\u2014living, practicing, and even socializing together. The first match of the Olympics (held in Orlando not far from the training center on July 21, 1996) was attended by an unprecedented 25,000 fans who watched the Americans beat Denmark 3\u20130, despite a temperature on the field of 100 degrees. The team continued to battle its way to the finals, winning over Sweden 2\u20131, and then advancing over Norway in a breathtaking 2\u20131 victory in overtime. Another record crowd turned out to watch them triumph 2\u20131 over a superb Chinese team, although as Time magazine's Bill Saporito pointed out, few television viewers saw them win the gold medal because NBC scuttled the game in favor of the diving competition.\n\nThe Olympic victory turned the national spotlight on the team, bringing lucrative endorsement deals to several players as well as requests for interviews and personal appearances. Posters of superstar Mia Hamm and her selection as one of People magazine's Most Beautiful People of the Year gave rise to what was termed, in '90s parlance, the \"babe\" factor, a distraction that was further fueled by Julie Foudy's photograph in a swimsuit issue of Sports Illustrated and Brandi Chastain's appearance in Gear magazine clad only in cleats and a strategically placed soccer ball. The latter raised some eyebrows, but the team's predominant image was a wholesome, positive one, especially for young female soccer hopefuls, many of whom had never before had strong role models in the sports world. Noted Akers in reference to the team's high profile:\n\nNow little girls all over the U.S. and the world put on their uniforms and lace up their cleats with the example and opportunity of the U.S. National Team to inspire and encourage them to chase their dreams on the soccer filed\u2014and beyond. This realization alone is an incredible and wonderful achievement for all of us who have battled and won the right to pursue our potential as soccer players and people.\n\nWhen it came time to plan for the 1999 Women's World Cup, Marla Messing, CEO of the Women's World Cup Organizing Committee, convinced the male-dominated International Federation of Football Associations (FIFA) that the women's team was equal in drawing power to the men's. Thus, the 32 matches of the tournament were staged in large stadiums in major cities across the country and were also televised on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN2. Even the advertising had a gender-equity theme, like the Nike spot featuring Mia Hamm and Michael Jordan in an \"anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better\" face-off. \"We have established a worldclass, world-caliber, stand alone event for women like none other,\" Messing boasted. Indeed, the tournament proved to be all that and more, generating the sale of some 650,000 tickets\u201475,000 for the opening game alone, the largest number ever for a women's sporting event. And the women's team didn't disappoint the promoters or the fans. From their first win over Denmark (3\u20130) to their quarterfinal squeak by Germany (3\u20132), the excitement generated by the U.S. team eventually drew over 90,000 fans, including President Bill Clinton, to Pasadena's Rose Bowl on July 10, 1999, to witness the final play-off game against a formidable Chinese team.\n\nThe event was as taut a defensive battle as anyone could imagine, resulting in 120 minutes of scoreless play, including two overtime periods. During the last breathless minutes of overtime, the Chinese almost stole the match, but Fan Yunjie 's header off a corner kick was mercifully cleared off the line by Kristine Lilly. The game then went to a penalty-kick shoot-off\u2014much dreaded by players and determined as much by luck as by skill. Americans Carla Overbeck and Joy Fawcett made their first two penalty shots, as did Xie Huilin and Qui Haiyan of China. Liu Ying , however, was stopped by a tremendous save by American goalkeeper Briana Scurry, which cleared the way for Kristine Lilly to land her shot and tip the score to 3\u20132. Zhang Ouying then made the fourth penalty kick, as did Mia Hamm. Sue Wen also connected, tying up the score. Then Brandi Chastain slammed the ball into the left corner of the goal to win the match 5\u20134 and clinch America's place in soccer history. While Chastain joyfully fell to her knees, pumped her fists in the air, and stripped off her jersey to reveal her black sports bra, her teammates flooded the field to hoist the World Cup and receive their gold medals. \"The last five games have been for all of America to jump on our backs,\" said Tiffeny Milbrett . \"This was for us. That's why we wanted it so bad. We had come from so far and done so much. We want to be able to go out right.\" Commenting on a win that was watched with awe around the world, Kristine Lilly noted: \"This moment is more than a game. It's about female athletes. It's about sport. It's about everything. I don't think we can sustain this level of attention. But I think people caught on to us. They attached themselves to us and I don't think they're going to let go.\" Lilly's remark would prove to be prophetic.\n\nThe response to the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team proved just how far the world had come since the days of Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympics, who wrote in 1937, \"Let women do all the sports they wish\u2014but not in public.\" Yet members of the team were not content to rest on their World Cup and Olympic successes. To advance their sport, they supported the founding of a professional American women's soccer league, an enterprise that would cost millions of dollars. By the crowds drawn to their matches around the world, as well as the newly proven television appeal of women's soccer, the team demonstrated that women's professional soccer in America had the potential to draw the kind of support required to sustain a new league. In April 2001, hailed as the premiere international professional women's league, the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) made its debut appearance in a match between the Washington Freedom, Mia Hamm's team, and the Bay Area CyberRays, Brandi Chastain's team, at RKF Stadium in Washington, D.C. In an indication that the future of American women's professional soccer looks bright, start-up costs for the league ran to $64 million dollars. Two years before the league's first game, Mia Hamm was already looking ahead of its inception: \"I hope it can succeed on its own\u2026. What we don't want is just for it to be around for a couple of years. We want it to endure the test of time and be around for my kids to play in.\"\n\nAmong the standouts of the history-making 1999 World Cup victory were names that would not be soon forgotten: Michelle Akers, Brandi Chastain, Joy Fawcett, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly, Carla Overbeck, and Briana Scurry.\n\nMichelle Akers\n\nAn original member of the U.S. national team, midfielder Michelle Akers scored the first goal in the squad's history in 1985. In career scoring, she was just five goals behind Mia Hamm in the spring of 1999, even though she had played 32 fewer matches. Hamm called her the best goal scorer ever to play the game: \"Not only does she have a shot that is probably measurably harder than anyone else's in the world \u2026 but her sophistication in finishing is remarkable. Michelle scores goals through power and finesse and from all different angles.\"\n\nA four-time All-American at the University of Southern Florida, in 1988 Akers received the first Hermann Trophy, given to the nation's top college player. She almost took the 1991 World Cup single-handedly, scoring ten goals in six matches, including the winner in the final with Norway. In 1995, she went down with head and knee injuries in the opener, and the team subsequently lost the cup.\n\nDistinguished by her thick mane of curly blonde hair and knees that bear the scars of at least 12 operations, Akers became a symbol of triumph over adversity as the nation watched her play the highest caliber of soccer while battling Chronic Fatigue and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS). \"It's just a pain in the butt to live with, there's no other way to put it,\" said a 33-year-old Akers who was diagnosed with CFIDS in 1993 and had to alter her game to conserve energy. \"You get these migraines that are unbearable, you can't sleep, you're dizzy all the time and your short-term memory is shot.\" For her to keep playing, Akers' will often had to override warning symptoms from her body. At the 1996 Olympic semifinals against Norway, with every muscle in her body on fire, she saved the day by landing a penalty kick that tied the score 1\u20131 just 14 minutes before the end of the match. (Shannon MacMillan went on to score the game-winning point in overtime.) After the penalty kick, Akers was ousted off the field by the U.S. trainers, who immediately hooked her up to an IV. The effort cost her a year (1997) on the sidelines.\n\nAlthough up and running for World Cup '99, Akers was never sure if she'd be able to play until just before a game, and once in the game she never knew how long she would hold out: \"I have to make sure I stay strong enough to make it to the next game. I always have to worry if I'm going to run out of gas. And it can happen without any warning.\" She played the full opener against Denmark (and scored a goal), but only made it through the first half in the game against Nigeria before coach DiCicco took her out. In the final play-off game against China, Akers made the most of what would be her last World Cup, spearheading a China-breaking defense with a recklessness that forced her out of the game near the end of regulation play and would cost her the post-game celebrations and appearances. She once remarked: \"I need to play with wild abandon every once in a while or it wouldn't be me.\"\n\nA shoulder injury combined with the CFIDS kept Akers from joining her team for their silvermedal-winning run at the Olympics in 2000. That year, her autobiography, written with Gregg Lewis, appeared as The Game and the Glory: An Autobiography. To build back her strength with hopes of playing in the Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA) during 2002, Akers took a year off in 2001, spending time in physical therapy and running her non-profit organization for kids, Soccer Outreach International. Akers helped to increase awareness about CFIDS by testifying before Congress in May 1996. \"If you saw me today,\" she said, \"you would see a healthy, physically fit, elite athlete. But I'm not. I am sick. Some days it is all I can do to get through the day\u2026. I have learned to accept CFIDS as an opportunity to make a difference. I have turned this weakness into a strength \u2026 and even though it is still raging inside me, I refuse to be beaten by it. I will overcome. And I will show others how to overcome.\"\n\nBrandi Chastain\n\nNoted for her diligence, versatility, and phenomenal kick, Brandi Chastain emerged as the hero of the 1999 World Cup tournament. After committing a huge gaffe in the game against Germany, when she scored in her own net, Chastain set things right by slamming in the fifth and decisive penalty kick in the spectacular play-off game against China. The winning goal prompted her to tear off her jersey (revealing a black Nike sports bra) in a gesture that, despite some controversy, would live on in the national consciousness as symbolic of the historic victory. Remarked Skip Wollenberg in July 1999: \"Brandi Chastain may have created the best-known new undie since the Wonderbra when she doffed her jersey after delivering the winning kick at the Women's World Cup. Nike, which makes the soccer team's sports bras, is now trying to figure out how to convert that moment of marketing magic into new sales.\" For her part, Chastain later chalked the moment up to temporary insanity: \"I thought, My God, this is the greatest moment of my life on the soccer field! I just lost my head.\" Her stunning pose\u2014sans uniform\u2014in Gear magazine also captured more than a little attention. \"Hey, I ran my ass off for this body,\" she noted. \"I'm proud of it.\"\n\nChastain played forward on the 1991 World championship team, then was not called up again until the 1996 Olympics, at which time she switched to the backfield. When the team shifted formations in 1998, she moved to midfield, displaying again her ability to play a variety of positions. Her strong kicking skills prompted coach Tony DiCicco to remark: \"You can't tell if she's right- or left-footed, which is very rare.\" Chastain practices with a vengeance and is also a consummate student of the game. \"If there's a game on TV, she's in front of it,\" said DiCicco.\n\nA native Californian, Chastain is married to Jerry Smith, head coach at Santa Clara University. During her down time, she serves as an assistant women's soccer coach at Santa Clara. Chastain's off-field activities, which have included several appearances on late-night television, have not interfered with her seriousness about soccer and the reputation of the women's national team. \"People will keep this in their memory a long time,\" she noted, referring to America's recapturing of the World Cup. \"The lasting impression will be that 20 people on the field gave their all. Not only for themselves but for their country.\"\n\nJoy Fawcett\n\nJoy Fawcett, along with teammate Carla Overbeck, redefined the term \"soccer mom.\" Within three months of giving birth to each of her daughters, Fawcett returned to the field, keeping her girls with her on the road and while training in Florida. A veteran of the women's national team since 1987, she started and played every minute of every match of World Cup '95 and the '96 Olympics. At the Olympics, Fawcett assisted on Tiffeny Milbrett's gold medal-clinching goal against China. A three-time All-American at the University of California, Berkeley, Fawcett also holds the school's all-time scoring record with 55 goals and 23 assists. In 1993, she was hired as UCLA's first women's soccer coach, a position she held until 1998.\n\nHer husband Walter, a software engineer in Orange County, California, visits the family at least once a month. \"It's crazy,\" remarked teammate Kristine Lilly who watches Fawcett's balancing act with something like awe. \"After practice, we get to kick back and relax a little, but Joy is off running around with the kids. I don't know where she gets the energy from.\" Fawcett, though, thinks nothing of combining soccer with raising a family: \"I have eight brothers and sisters, so seeing my mom raise all of us and run a day-care center at the same time, well, I've got some catching up to do.\" Since 1998, both Fawcett and Overbeck, the only other mother on the team, have received a little help from the U.S. Soccer Federation which agreed to pay $750 a week for a nanny; still, the commitments of a soccer career and family life call for a good balancing act. Coach Tony DiCicco was initially worried that the arrangement might affect Fawcett's stamina, but she remained a stalwart of the team. A founding player of the WUSA, Fawcett began her play for the league on the San Diego Spirit. At age five, her daughter Katey was ready to start playing in a kiddies soccer league and was already bragging about her kick.\n\nJulie Foudy\n\nBy all accounts, U.S. team midfielder and co-captain Julie Foudy (\"Loudy\") is the team loudmouth. \"She's very vocal and directive on the field,\" noted teammate Carla Overbeck. \"Her competitive spirit is unbelievable, and she makes sure we keep our heads in the game.\" Just 17 when she joined the national team in 1988, Foudy made her presence felt immediately. \"Oh, she was little Miss Prom Queen right from the start,\" remarked Akers. \"She didn't miss a step, and nothing intimidates her. She has the most exuberant personality of anyone I've ever met, and she's dynamic on and off the field.\"\n\nA California native, Foudy was a two-time all American at Mission Viejo High School in California and a four-time All-American at Stanford University. Graduating with a degree in biology in 1993, where she was accepted into medical school but delayed enrollment for the 1996 Olympics, Foudy started and played every match at the 1991 Women's World Cup. She missed the 1995 championships, however, because she was on her honeymoon. At the 1996 Olympics, she assisted on Shannon MacMillan's spectacular sudden-death overtime goal in the 2\u20131 win over Norway, which Mia Hamm called \"the most important pass ever for women's soccer in the United States.\"\n\nIn 1998, Foudy was hired by ESPN as an instudio analyst for the men's World Cup. \"She studied her butt off for that, learning all she could about the players and the teams,\" said Kristine Lilly, who wasn't surprised by Foudy's foray into television. \"When she's committed to something, she'll do it to the best of her abilities.\" Foudy received excellent reviews for her commentary.\n\nA well-built 5'6\" brunette with a radiant smile, Foudy was also tapped by Sports Illustrated for their swimsuit issue, although the shoot was a wholesome frolic on the beach with her husband Ian. Then it was right back to barking out orders to teammates (part of her job as midfielder\u2014soccer's equivalent to a quarterback). \"If I was quiet,\" she said, \"people would think something was wrong.\" Foudy was a founding player of the WUSA, beginning her participation in the league on the San Diego Spirit.\n\nMia Hamm\n\nThe star forward of the U.S. World Cup Women's Soccer Team and the number one goal scorer ever, man or woman, Mia Hamm served as a driving force behind the growing popularity of women's soccer in America during the 1990s. Following the gold-medal win of the Women's Soccer Team at the 1996 Olympics, the fresh-faced 27-year-old became one of the most recognized athletes in the nation and a role model to thousands of young schoolgirls who dreamed of glory on the soccer field. \"I think she's the best player in the world, absolutely,\" remarked longtime teammate Julie Foudy. \"In the women's game, when you find a fast player they're usually not as sharp technically because they've always been able to kick the ball and outrun everybody. That's what makes Mia so tough, she's fast and she has great technical ability.\" But Hamm has not always had the same ease with her star status as she does on the field. \"I'm just another player trying to fill my role on this talented team,\" she said in a 1998 interview in Scholastic Coach & Athletic Director. \"Since I score goals, I get more attention. But ask anyone on the team and they will tell you how important our defenders, midfielders, and goalkeepers are to our success.\"\n\nA self-described \"military brat\" as the daughter of an Air Force colonel, Hamm grew up in Florence, Italy, and in American cities in Alabama, California, Texas, and Virginia, following her father's postings. Constantly on the move, she found stability on the soccer field during her young life. Although she played on a few all-girl teams while growing up, primarily she played with the boys. \"It was either play with the boys or not play at all,\" she writes in her 1999 book Go for the Goal. \"Most important, playing with boys really helped me become competitive and develop that combative spirit I have today.\" As a kid, Hamm played other sports too, trying to keep up with her older brother Garrett, a Thai-American orphan whom the Hamms adopted when he was eight. Mia was five when Garrett joined the family, and the two became best pals almost immediately. She would later recall: \"He let me hang out with him and his friends and play football, soccer and basketball with them.\" Garrett's own dreams of a professional baseball career were dashed when he was diagnosed with aplastic anemia at 16, but he remained a constant source of inspiration to his little sister.\n\nAt 14, Hamm played in a U.S. Soccer Federation women's tournament in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she met Anson Dorrance, then coach of the women's team at the University of North Carolina and of the U.S. women's national team. He was so impressed with her explosive speed and athletic ability that he recruited her on the spot, making her the youngest player ever to make the national team. Dorrance was later quoted in Newsweek (June 21, 1999) as remarking: \"this little girl took off like she was shot out of a cannon. I thought, 'Oh my God.' I couldn't believe the athleticism.\" Dorrance also steered Hamm to the University of North Carolina, where he served as her coach. With Hamm's parents in Italy during her college years, she found a father figure in Dorrance and became close to his family. \"Even as a freshman, Mia had unbelievable talent,\" said Dorrance. \"If she had never practiced a lick, she'd still have been one of college soccer's all-time great players.\"\n\nBut Hamm did practice, developing a masterful dribble\u2014executed equally well with either foot\u2014incredible focus, and, of course, her remarkable ability to slam the ball into the net to make the goal. \"A great finisher can analyze in a split second what the goalie is doing, what surface of the foot to use, and then put the ball in exactly the right spot,\" she said. \"It's an ability to slow down time. You don't actually shoot any faster than any other players do, but you process a lot more information in the same time.\" A relentless competitor, she developed a reputation for pushing herself to an almost super-human capacity.\n\nHamm played on four straight NCAA championship teams, was named All-American three times, and became the NCAA's all-time scorer. In 1991, she took a year off from college to help the national team win the first-ever Women's World championship held in China, a victory that was barely noted in American newspapers. She then returned to school, graduating in 1994 with a degree in political science and an armful of athletic awards, including the Mary Garber Award as ACC Female Athlete of the Year and the Honda Broderick Cup given to the most outstanding female athlete in collegiate sports. Soon after graduating, she married Christiaan Corey, a Marine Corps pilot and fellow Chapel Hill student.\n\nThere was little time to enjoy married life, however, as another World Cup tournament was on the horizon. The hype surrounding the 1994 men's World Cup, coupled with the addition of women's soccer as an Olympic-medal event, brought a rush of attention to the women's soccer team. A new training center was established in Florida, and team members were put on salary for the first time, thus allowing them to focus entirely on World Cup practice. They faced new challenges when Coach Dorrance left to focus on his collegiate team, and Tony DiCicco took his place. In addition, the team was up against the promise of stiff competition in defense of the Cup. \"Anyone of the teams could beat us this year,\" Hamm cautioned at the time. \"We're all basically equal in talent.\" The remark would prove to be prophetic. The U.S. was ultimately overcome in the semifinals by their arch rivals Norway, who kept them at bay by establishing a 1\u20130 lead in the first half of the game which they never relinquished. The tournament saw Hamm fight for her team not only from her regular position but also as goalkeeper, which she played for several minutes in their second game, against Denmark, when Briana Scurry was ejected on a controversial hand-ball infraction and the team had already used up its allotment of three substitutions.\n\nIf anything, the loss of the World Cup energized Hamm, who set the determined tone for the team as they entered the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. Spraining her ankle in the opening round against Sweden, she rose above the pain to help the U.S. to victory over Norway in the semifinal, paving the way for the final confrontation with China. A record 76,000 fans filled the stadium to witness the match-up, including Hamm's family and brother Garrett, who was now very ill. Hamm performed several crucial passes to push the Americans ahead 2\u20131, until her ankle finally gave out just before the end of the game. Her teammates kept China at bay for the remaining 60 seconds, and they had the gold. Hamm ignored the pain while sprinting to the field to join her teammates. Summing up the leaping, screaming, and hugging that followed, she noted: \"We went bananas.\"\n\nHailed as the hero of the game, Hamm was now the darling of the sports world. Her celebrity status grew daily with a flood of endorsement offers that included Nike and Gatorade. There were endless requests for interviews and photo sessions. A crowd of adoring fans dogged her for autographs, and she made a television commercial with fellow North Carolina alum Michael Jordan. But the notoriety made her cringe. \"It's weird getting attention,\" she said. \"I'm not this perfect person.\" In May 1997, she was named one of People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People, an honor about which her teammates proudly teased her without mercy.\n\nWhile Hamm was adjusting to life in the spotlight, her brother was waiting for a bone-marrow transplant, his only hope for survival. Hamm used her new-found celebrity to help in the search for a compatible marrow donor for him, a quest complicated by Garrett's Thai-Anglo background and lack of biological siblings. She used every public appearance, speaking engagement, and soccer clinic to distribute flyers explaining the importance of bone-marrow screening and describing the process. Garrett finally received a transplant in February 1997 but died from complications the following April, leaving behind a wife and small son. His death was a devastating blow for Hamm.\n\nTo be with her family, she missed the first two games of the Olympic Victory Tour in April 1997. Knowing that her brother would have wanted her to get back out on the field, she joined the team for the third game of the tour in Milwaukee: \"To focus mentally after that ordeal was one of the biggest challenges I've faced, and I must admit I really struggled to cope with my emotions and concentrate on soccer, but my teammates were remarkable in their caring for me and my family. There's no way I could have come back without their support and love, and I will always be grateful.\" To carry on her brother's name, she established The Mia Hamm Foundation, which raises funds and makes charitable grants to organizations dedicated to battling bone-marrow diseases.\n\nWhile some might have thought that the Olympic gold-medal performance of 1996 would be hard to surpass, Hamm and the U.S. Women's Team went on to victory in the 1999 Women's World Cup\u2014a win of epic proportions both for the team and for women's soccer in America\u2014which the players felt eclipsed any of their previous successes. Over a three-week period in late June and July 1999, the tournament was played in seven different venues across the U.S. and became one of the most spectacular sporting events in recent years. \"The crowd was absolutely unbelievable,\" said Hamm of the record 79,000 fans who turned out at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, to watch the first game. She booted in the first goal 17 minutes into the\n\nfirst half, but it was team chemistry that won the game and propelled them through five subsequent wins to a final match-up with their old nemesis, China. The play-off game\u2014before a record crowd of over 90,000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, and an unprecedented number of television viewers as well\u2014resulted in 120 minutes of scoreless soccer, including two 15-minute sudden death overtime periods. In the end, everything would boil down to a penalty-kick shoot-out to determine the winner. After scoring kicks by Carla Overbeck, Joy Fawcett, Kristine Lilly, Hamm, and Brandi Chastain, and a spectacular save by goalkeeper Briana Scurry who prevented China's Liu Ying from scoring on the third penalty kick, the United States won 5\u20134, securing their second World Cup triumph. After the team swarmed onto the field to join Chastain, the victory celebration began\u2014initiated by a lap with Old Glory around the arena and the gold-medal ceremony\u2014and then went on for days. After a whirlwind of parades and personal appearances, Hamm and her teammates were back in camp preparing for the U.S. Cup in early October and the 2000 Olympics (where the team would take the silver medal).\n\nHamm's dream of a professional women's soccer league came to fruition in 2001, when she played for the Washington Freedom, one of eight teams of the fledgling Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA). For the league to succeed, it was clear that Hamm (voted \"the most appealing female athlete\" in a Burns Sports and Celebrities poll of ad executives) would need to put aside her dislike of personal publicity to take an active, visible part in promoting the WUSA. While recognizable faces play an enormous role in sports, \"[f]or new leagues, stars are even more vital,\" wrote Rachel Alexander in the Washington Post (April 11, 2001). \"Fans need a point of entry.\" Having once told a reporter to \"get a life\" when asked how it felt to make her recordbreaking 108th international goal (against Brazil in 1999), Hamm may never have warmed to the spotlight, but, as Billie Jean King noted, Hamm's goal of advancing soccer would likely require her to bear the burdens of fame. \"It is very, very important to her,\" said Hamm's agent David Bober, \"to make [the league] work.\"\n\nWhen not on the field or training, Hamm serves as a volunteer coach for the University of North Carolina women's soccer team. She enjoys working with young people and is also active with City Block Soccer, an inner-city soccer league which she was involved in as a child, and Nike's P.L.A.Y. (Participate in the Lives of American Youth). For relaxation, she plays golf, reads, or just kicks back and watches television. Although known as shy and serious in demeanor, she shows other traits to her teammates, prompting Foudy to remark: \"I think Mia's dream is to direct 'Saturday Night Live.' She's like this closet comic. We're constantly acting out skits. She has this dry sense of humor, and she does these nutty impersonations. Unfortunately, she doesn't let people see that side of her.\"\n\nIn addition to soccer, Hamm is devoted to the work of her foundation, which was established with the support of Nike, Mattel, and Gatorade. Along with supporting bone-marrow research, the foundation's mission is to empower young female athletes. Hamm's brother Garrett is with her every time she steps onto a field. In her deal with Nike, the shoe company agreed to inscribe his initials, GJH, on the bottom of every pair of her signature shoes, the Nike Air Zoom M9 (\"M9\" standing for Mia and her number 9). \"I've been blessed by so many things,\" she noted, \"but I would give them all up to have him back.\"\n\nKristine Lilly\n\nSince her first appearance with the national team against China in 1987, forward Kristine Lilly made more appearances for her country than any other soccer player in history, male or female. Raised in Wilton, Connecticut, where she returns each summer to run the Kristine Lilly Soccer Academy, she led Wilton High School to three state titles. At North Carolina University, Lilly was a four-time All-American and won four NCAA titles (1989\u201392).\n\nKnown for her work ethic and drive, Lilly is described as \"the epitome of consistency\" by teammates Overbeck, Foudy, and Akers. \"She's my favorite player in the world,\" adds Akers. \"She has it all. She's got the winner mentality. She's extremely skillful with both feet. Tactically, she knows the game as well as anyone. When I talk to young kids, I tell them to watch Lil.\"\n\nLilly, who is never far away from her beloved golden retriever Molson, is known as a compassionate friend to her teammates. A big New York Jets fan, she was particularly pleased that their home stadium in New Jersey's Meadowlands was selected as one of the venues for the 1999 World Cup.\n\nCarla Overbeck\n\nLike her teammate Joy Fawcett, co-captain and defender Carla Overbeck combines motherhood with the demands of her career. Her young son Jackson accompanied her at camp and on the road, and her husband Greg, a restaurateur in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, visits the two for a few days every couple weeks. \"It's really tough being without my family,\" he admitted. \"But Carla has worked so hard and sacrificed everything to be on this team, and I totally support what she's doing.\" Although Jackson, who along with Joy Fawcett's two girls is in the care of a nanny when she is practicing or playing, seems to be thriving, Overbeck does have moments of doubt. \"Now Jackson associates his father with the telephone,\" she says. \"The other day my cell phone rang when Greg was with us, and Jackson still said, 'Daddy.'\"\n\nOverbeck attended Richardson High School in Dallas but didn't play soccer until she was at the University of North Carolina, where she won four NCAA titles. She made her first appearance with the national team in June 1988 and was one of two players to start and play every minute of both the World Cup '95 and the '96 Olympics (fellow mom Joy Fawcett was the other). From August 4, 1993, to August 1, 1996, Overbeck played 63 consecutive matches for the U.S., a record for any U.S. National Team member, male or female. She was a founding player of the WUSA who began her play with the league as a member of the Carolina Courage. When not playing or training, she serves as the assistant women's soccer coach at Duke University.\n\nWhile to her teammates Overbeck is a calming influence\u2014\"You could make a horrible play, and she's right there telling you to forget about it,\" said Kristine Lilly\u2014such calmness does not extend to her opponents: \"If you're a forward shooting down the tube at her,\" said Akers, \"you'd better strap on your shinguards 'cause she's not gonna let you get by easy. She's hard back there. And she's totally committed to winning. That motivates the rest of the team to do the same.\"\n\nBriana Scurry\n\n\"I knew that was going to be the one,\" said goalkeeper Briana Scurry following her remarkable block of Liu Ying 's shot at the goal during the penalty-kick shoot-off that determined the winner of the U.S.-China play-off for the 1999 World Cup. \"She just didn't look like she wanted to be there. She didn't have that confidence. You could see it in the way she walked up there.\" Scurry, who hadn't faced a penalty kicker in four years, took full advantage of her observations, staring Ying down with her formidable scowl, then taking a dive left to swat away the oncoming ball. Her job done, she didn't even watch teammate Chastain's winning drive into the net, afraid she might jinx it. Only when the screaming crowd of 90,000 rose to their feet did the joy register in a smile. Even in the middle of celebrating the victory, Scurry was already thinking about which of her teammates she might not see again. \"I'll probably have post-excitement syndrome,\" she said about the days ahead. \"Be totally depressed for the next three months.\"\n\nThe U.S. team's only African-American starter, Scurry earned the title of shutout queen while at the University of Massachusetts, where she racked up 37 shutouts in 65 starts. She joined the U.S. national team in 1984 and during her first season recorded 7 shutouts in 12 starts. Although she suffered a back injury in an auto accident in 1995, she was back in goal for the World Cup as well as for the Olympics in 1996 and 2000. A founding player of the WUSA, Scurry began her contribution to the league as a member of the Atlanta Beat.\n\nDescribed by Mia Hamm as \"cat-quick\" and having nerves of steel, Scurry regards courage as one of the most important traits of goal keeping. \"Many aspects of the position require that you stick your head into places most people wouldn't dare,\" she noted. \"Sometimes you get kicked in places any sane person definitely wouldn't want to get kicked in, but that's just part of the job.\"\n\nsources:\n\nAlexander, Rachel. \"Hamm in a New League of Her Own,\" in The Washington Post.

She was 30 and he was 37. Mary may well have fallen in love, but the marriage made economic sense too. Although she had worked since girlhood, she earned only 12 shillings a week \u2013 just above the average women\u2019s wage at the turn of the century, but not really enough for her to live comfortably on her own. And, given the limited employments available to women, Mary knew she had little hope of ever getting more. Jimmy could earn more than twice her wage \u2013 hardly a fortune, but enough (if his wife were a canny manager) to support a family in this hardscrabble, low-income town.\n\nBut Mary was also taking a gamble on marriage. She\u2019d likely lose control of her own fertility; if children came, she wouldn\u2019t be able to go out to work. She would be, as the law would consider her, a \u2018dependant\u2019, entitled to be supported by her husband but not really able to enforce that right if Jimmy proved unreliable. And so it turned out. Jimmy preferred the pub to the docks; he worked, but not regularly, and drank much of what he earned. Mary had seven children: the two who survived endured childhoods marked by violence, serial evictions and gnawing hunger.\n\nI imagine Emma Griffin chose to open her engaging history of 19th-century working-class family economics with the story of the O\u2019Mearas because it suggests what was structural and inescapable about their trajectory but also what was a consequence of personality and luck. The labour market and the wage system were both structured by sex; married women and children had no choice but to depend on the husband\u2019s wage. If that wage failed \u2013 because of injury or death, desertion or neglect \u2013 the family would face desperate poverty. Mary may have experienced her fate as individual and accidental \u2013 a consequence of Jimmy\u2019s weak character and her own poor choices \u2013 but it was in fact common and predictable. Inevitably, a proportion of men would fail to provide; inevitably, their families would suffer the consequences.\n\nBut Griffin opens with the O\u2019Mearas for a second reason: because they left a record. We know a lot about this unhappy couple because their fifth child, remarkably, wrote an autobiography. Timothy O\u2019Meara, born in 1901, ran off to sea and then emigrated to the United States. He settled in Baltimore, became a taxi driver, and in 1933, as \u2018Pat O\u2019Mara\u2019, published a picaresque account of a ragged but adventurous childhood lived on the docklands streets. The Autobiography of a Liverpool Irish Slummy still finds appreciative readers. Few of those readers, though, can have Griffin\u2019s purposes in mind.\n\nHer goal in Bread Winner is to help us see the gendered economic logic that structured Victorian working-class life, but in a way that keeps its human consequences always in view. For Griffin, this has involved a decision to restrict her source base to the more than 650 autobiographies written by working-class men and women who lived between the start of the 19th century and the First World War. These sources are rich and revealing, and historians have been using them for decades to explore working-class culture, politics, religiosity, literacy, family relations and much else. Using them as a database for a quantitative as well as qualitative account of the economics of family life is quixotic, however \u2013 and not just because working-class autobiographers were, simply by virtue of picking up a pen, unrepresentative. The problem is more that Griffin has excluded from her purview the ocean of records produced by 19th-century local authorities, charities, social investigators and moralists who were obsessed, really obsessed, with the earning and spending habits of the poor. Rather disarmingly, she tells us that she had intended to exploit these materials, but in the end simply \u2018could not wean myself off life writing as a historical source\u2019 \u2013 although, of course, using the latter did not oblige her to ignore the former. I\u2019ll return to the consequences of these choices later.\n\nThere was only one template for 19th-century working-class family life, Griffin tells us: \u2018a father who was the breadwinner; and a mother who was, primarily, the homemaker\u2019. This isn\u2019t to say that families followed the script, still less that it worked to protect their most vulnerable members. Far from it. If fathers failed or disappeared, mothers almost invariably tried to earn. Unfortunately, they entered a landscape in which women\u2019s wages were low, women\u2019s jobs scarce, and women\u2019s absolute and sole responsibility for managing their household unquestioned, even by the women themselves. In her 650-plus autobiographies, Griffin found only three wives of fully employed men who kept working throughout their marriages, and just one (yes, one) wife who earned more than her working husband \u2013 which made the husband resentful and destroyed the marriage. Whether marriage really was women\u2019s \u2018pleasantest preservative from want\u2019 (as clear-eyed Charlotte Lucas tells Lizzie Bennet before accepting the fatuous Mr Collins), for most working-class women in this era, it was their only preservative from want, full stop.\n\nThis profound inequality of opportunity meant that boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 experiences of work, and all its associated blessings (respect, pocket money, camaraderie, outside interests), were very different. Rampant sexual harassment notwithstanding, girls relished earning as much as boys did: it was, after all, their only means of claiming better treatment, a modicum of leisure and a few coins of their own. But because sons had much better opportunities, families had a far greater interest in keeping them in work \u2013 and so in possession of more freedom and spending money. Girls, by contrast, were routinely pulled out of jobs to care for younger siblings or help with housework. This domestic drudgery was almost never preferred to wage-earning, especially since it also cut off the possibility of wider interests and adult pleasures. Male autobiographers often recount finding their way into adult education, the trade union movement, the Labour Party, ultimately even Parliament, through their work; the very few working-class women who entered politics, by contrast, relied on supportive parents \u2013 and tended to be unmarried and childless to boot. The suffragette Hannah Mitchell recalled the desperation she felt on falling pregnant, as she feared family responsibilities would end her political work. Unusually, she managed to limit her family to that one child \u2013 a choice we now take for granted, but which was almost impossible at that time for women of her class. And if marriage could curtail women\u2019s modest earnings or freedoms, bereavement was an economic disaster, sending widows scrambling to find some, any, employment compatible with their domestic work (selling baked goods, taking in sewing or washing, renting out a room) as well as, if possible, a replacement spouse.\n\nNow, there is a serious chicken-and-egg problem here. Were women and girls so poorly paid because they were expected to marry, or did they withdraw from wage earning and marry because they could gain their bread no other way? Did men earn so much more because they had \u2018families to keep\u2019, or did families rely on fathers because they were the only people with money? Griffin insists that low female wages need to be seen as \u2018an important structural element of society\u2019, a means of ensuring that all families had access to women\u2019s unpaid domestic work \u2013 and, 19th-century feminists would have added, that all men had access to one sexual bondswoman of their own. But the key point is that even if both partners understood the contract underlying working-class marriage, only one of them \u2013 the man \u2013 had much choice about whether to keep up his end. Because most of the money on which the family relied was paid to the man, he alone could choose whether or not to share it. This is where Griffin\u2019s statistics are most revelatory. Fewer than two-thirds of her working-class men were \u2018good providers\u2019, she finds; just over a third were not. Rather shockingly, of these \u2018bad providers\u2019, just under two-thirds were what one might call \u2018bad providers by choice\u2019: that is, they could have supported their families, but spent their money on their own interests and pleasures instead. (Women, I\u2019m afraid, were much less interesting. Although a few neglected or exploited their children \u2013 including one mother who pimped out her young daughter \u2013 most slaved away at the endless cycle of water-hauling, shopping, cooking, cleaning, child-minding, mending and nursing that raising half a dozen children in a back-to-back without indoor plumbing involved.)\n\nSo women and children who had the misfortune to be dependent on \u2018bad providers\u2019 suffered all the indignities and hardships familiar to readers of Victorian fiction. It\u2019s in sketching the routine aspects of life in the \u2018average\u2019 male-breadwinner family, however, that Griffin\u2019s devotion to autobiography pays off. Children were well aware that a \u2018good father\u2019 was a good provider, and vividly recalled the weekly ritual \u2013 often performed in their presence \u2013 when their father turned over his pay packet unopened to his wife, who would then \u2018tip back\u2019 some money for tobacco or other treats. They knew their own lives depended on that performance (or on the stratagems their mothers devised to extract wages from reluctant men), and while some recalled supportive or loving fathers, paternal affection \u2013 even attention \u2013 was understood as just an added bonus. A good father didn\u2019t have to be interested in his children, or especially like them: he merely had to accept that they were his responsibility. Fathers, after all, were almost always out; they were distant figures, ever at work. One child could recall his father \u2013 and this was a \u2018good father\u2019 \u2013 speaking to him directly only once in his life.\n\nNo one considered it unjust that fathers received the lion\u2019s share of anything good that was going. Griffin has a chapter on food that might be shocking today but will seem quite familiar to anyone raised (as I was) in a family still in the backwash of the male breadwinner norm. Respectable working-class families tried to put a roast on the table on Sundays \u2013 and to make it stretch to stews and meat pies for a few days after that \u2013 but children remembered that their fathers ate the best (or all) of the meat, while they ate the onions and gravy. Fathers sat down to a kipper or a boiled egg at breakfast (and gave one favoured child the top); their dependants ate porridge. Kind fathers sometimes shared tidbits; others avoided the whole drama and ate alone. It\u2019s true, of course, that many men were doing hard manual labour: they needed those hearty meals. But these behaviours were also about status. Even men in sedentary jobs ate eggs and bacon while their children ate bread and dripping.\n\nMothers were different. Mothers fed you, sent you to school, decided when you\u2019d go to work \u2013 and, if you were a girl, pulled you out of school when you were needed at home. Mothers ruled every aspect of your life. Precisely because they were so familiar, however, children\u2019s attitudes towards mothers were less transactional and more complex. Autobiographies are replete with paeans to the heroism of mothers, who took in washing and riffled their husbands\u2019 pockets for the odd extra shilling, or, when all else failed, sent their children out to soup kitchens. But mothers were not necessarily loving; or rather, as Ellen Ross showed in Love and Toil (1993), her luminous study of London\u2019s working-class mothers, love was expressed through struggle and not caresses. The good mother might cuff her children, might shout at them, might show no interest at all in their imagination or \u2018development\u2019 \u2013 but she kept food in their bellies and coats on their backs. Griffin notes an undercurrent of something \u2013 not quite resentment, more loneliness or disappointment \u2013 in some children\u2019s accounts of their harsh and beset mothers, but she is aware, too, of how changes in attitudes towards childrearing inflect autobiography. We think now that parents (especially mothers) should nurture their children\u2019s personalities. These mothers had more than enough to do just keeping them alive.\n\nParadoxically, that struggle was hardest for the working-class mothers \u2013 like Mary O\u2019Meara \u2013 living in booming late Victorian towns. Working-class incomes rose in the 19th century \u2013 and yet, in turn, women\u2019s and children\u2019s vulnerability increased. Griffin\u2019s most striking finding is that once the subsistence crises of the first half of the century were overcome, urban children were much more likely to suffer privation than rural children, with roughly a third of urban fathers failing to provide, compared to a tenth of rural fathers. This was not because rural families were richer than urban families: on the contrary, they were poorer. But, precisely because of that poverty, rural families clung to an older, mutualist model of family life, with all their members pitching in and pooling resources. In cities, by contrast, men came to regard their wages as their own. The results of that shift were, for \u2018dependent\u2019 women and children, calamitous, with some fathers spending the ostensible \u2018family wage\u2019 on gambling, prostitutes, second families, religious causes, political activism, or whatever else they fancied; better-paid urban fathers were also much more likely to simply lose interest and walk away. The biggest problem, however, was always alcohol, with as many as a third of urban autobiographers reporting a \u2018problem drinker\u2019 in the family \u2013 usually the father, occasionally the mother. Children going to bed hungry so that their fathers could be \u2018continually drunk\u2019 makes for \u2018uncomfortable reading\u2019, Griffin admits, but she adds that alcohol is, after all, an addictive substance and one that was everywhere on offer in Victorian towns. Small wonder working men were tempted to turn in to a warm and inviting pub with their mates rather than face a furious wife and a row of hungry faces in their damp and cheerless homes. Rural men too would probably have liked a glass of ale at the end of a working day but, Griffin notes, often had to abstain for no better reason than that the nearest pub was three miles away.\n\nWe know that the 19th century was an era of rampant economic growth, rapid urbanisation and rising urban industrial wages. But Griffin concludes that \u2018something less positive was hiding in its slipstream: a sharp uptick in inequality between the sexes.\u2019 Those rising wages were enjoyed mostly by men; increased insecurity was suffered mostly by women and children. \u2018Wage-sharing at the family level is far more significant than scholars have recognised,\u2019 Griffin writes. \u2018We need to think more critically about the ownership of money within households and recognise the gap that could, and did, exist between real wages and family living standards.\u2019\n\nI agree with what Griffin says about the need to track distribution within the family and not simply across class lines, but I can\u2019t help but bristle at her admonitions. The economics of the working-class family, and the gendered effects of the institutionalised male family wage, are hardly neglected subjects. They were among the major research interests of a generation of social and women\u2019s historians \u2013 Deborah Valenze, Barbara Taylor, Sonya Rose, Anna Clark, Jane Humphries, Ellen Ross, Melanie Tebbutt, Hilary Land, Jane Lewis, Wally Seccombe, and many others. Griffin credits this generation of historians with \u2018establishing domestic life as a subject to be taken seriously\u2019, but says they were less successful \u2018in inserting the domestic into the mainstream\u2019. I am not sure what this means. Feminist historians wrote a great deal about the economics of the family, publishing that work in the standard academic journals and with the usual university presses. If \u2018mainstream\u2019 historians, whoever they are, simply declined to read their work, I hardly think those pioneering historians are to blame.\n\nYet\u200b Griffin\u2019s work is genuinely revisionist \u2013 of an economic history too reliant on quantitative methods but also, interestingly, of her own earlier work. In 2013 Griffin published Liberty\u2019s Dawn, a fairly sunny account of popular experience during the industrial revolution. That book acknowledged that women and children gained less from the rising wages and spreading prosperity of the era, but as a whole it leaned towards an \u2018optimist\u2019s\u2019 interpretation. It\u2019s easy to see why Griffin made that argument, for the earlier book drew on the same corpus of working-class autobiography on which Bread Winner is based. In this corpus, men\u2019s texts outnumber women\u2019s two to one and are (big surprise) on average three times the length. Working-class men\u2019s autobiographies also tend to conform to the template of the \u2018upward climb\u2019: two-thirds of their authors rose into the middle class (compared to a tiny fraction of ordinary working-class men) but only a third of working-class women autobiographers. Griffin\u2019s source base, then, is very likely to produce a progressive, male-centred and optimistic account of social change.\n\nIt is impressive that Griffin managed, in Bread Winner, to correct for this bias, milking her scarcer and briefer women\u2019s texts to write an account as attentive to women\u2019s experiences as men\u2019s. She has found that gender mattered a great deal, telling us (echoing Virginia Woolf) that \u2018the private world of the family is not separate from the public sphere of politics and economics.\u2019 I believe that her conclusions and indeed her statistics are basically right. But I base that judgment less on my faith in her autobiographical source base than on the fact that her arguments mirror, in almost every detail, those made by a generation of women social investigators, social reformers and socialists who worked with and among working-class housewives in the two decades before the First World War. The settlement house worker Anna Martin, the district nurse Margaret Loane, the Fabian socialists Barbara Drake and Maud Pember Reeves, Margaret Llewelyn Davies of the Women\u2019s Co-operative Guild and, especially, the social reformer and politician Eleanor Rathbone: these were the women whose studies first documented the inadequacies of the male breadwinner norm.\n\nThese works supply confirmation of Griffin\u2019s findings and a genealogy for her arguments. Let\u2019s go back, for example, to turn of the century Liverpool, the site of the O\u2019Mearas\u2019 unhappy story. Here, as Jimmy drank and Mary struggled, the young Rathbone launched an investigation into the structure of dock labour \u2013 a study that showed just how damaging the shift work and job insecurity of that trade were to dockers\u2019 families. A few years later she teamed up with local Fabians, social investigators and settlement house workers \u2013 as well as, crucially, working-class wives themselves \u2013 to produce How the Casual Labourer Lives (1909), a study of working-class budgets which revealed that labourers\u2019 wives had little idea what their husbands earned, that they were nonetheless entirely dependent on fluctuations in the male wage, that they struggled ceaselessly to keep their children fed against impossible odds, and that they would willingly earn themselves if they could find jobs that would pay. These investigations persuaded Rathbone that the economy was indelibly structured by gender, and after spending the First World War administering the payments made to soldiers\u2019 wives (and noting the resulting improvements in women\u2019s and children\u2019s health and independence), she threw herself into a 25-year campaign for children\u2019s allowances. That campaign finally succeeded with the Family Allowances Act of 1945 \u2013 which Rathbone, by then in the House of Commons, amended to ensure that the allowances would be paid to the mother.\n\nLet me come clean here. Some twenty years ago, thinking that people should at least have heard of the woman who did more than anyone to build some recognition of the hard work of motherhood into the welfare state, I wrote Rathbone\u2019s biography. I know that Rathbone\u2019s The Disinherited Family, first published in 1924, prefigured nearly all of Griffin\u2019s arguments, detailing how inadequately the purported \u2018family wage\u2019 met the needs of women and children, how deeply it undermined women\u2019s independence and self-respect, how it compromised women\u2019s capacity to earn, and how it was far from \u2018natural\u2019 but rather a human institution of relatively recent vintage. So I can\u2019t help but feel indignant on Rathbone\u2019s behalf when reading a work that painstakingly rediscovers, seemingly de novo, her findings of a century ago.\n\nWriting this, though, I feel the weight of Rathbone\u2019s disapproval settling around me. She wouldn\u2019t have worried about whether Griffin studied or cited her work. Her aim was to blow up \u2013 or more precisely to disaggregate \u2013 the male family wage, so that the womanly work of care could bring with it an entitlement to economic security and citizenship. She would be delighted with this book, which so thoroughly and empathetically exposes the entire inadequacy of the male breadwinner model. And her generous assessment should carry the day.\n\nWe currently face a frightening curtailment of women\u2019s fragile right to care for their children without sacrificing economic independence. Rathbone understood that the debilities of women stemmed less from their gender than from their motherhood, and so it is proving today. During the pandemic, with schools closed and virtually no social services available, mothers in the US and elsewhere are finding the dual burden of childcare and waged work impossible to sustain. Yes, men do more than they used to, but in May the New York Times reported that 45 per cent of men thought they spent more time home-schooling their children than their female partners did, while only 3 per cent of their partners agreed. One day recently I woke up to the headline that in September four times as many women as men in the US had lost or left their jobs, often to care for their children. Griffin\u2019s book argues \u2013 but also, inadvertently, shows \u2013 not just that the male breadwinner norm was damaging to children\u2019s wellbeing and women\u2019s equality, but also that this truth is still news to many. I hope against hope that this book might open their eyes."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/31121648/the-best-player-women-college-basketball-history-every-jersey-number", "page_content": "Sometimes, players pick specific jersey numbers, and they are even superstitious about it.

She averaged 15.5 PPG and 5.1 APG at Georgia, going to the Final Four in 1983 and '85. But Turner (14.8 PPG, 7.0 RPG) was a key part of a Louisiana Tech juggernaut that won national championships in the AIAW in 1981 and the NCAA in 1982, and she also went to two other Final Fours. Figgs was most outstanding player of the 1999 Final Four when Purdue won its championship.\n\n10. Sue Bird, UConn (1998-2002)\n\nSee also: *Rhyne Howard, Kentucky (2018-present); Megan Gustafson, Iowa (2015-19); Kelsey Plum, Washington (2013-17); Lindsey Harding, Duke (2002-07); Andrea Riley, Oklahoma State (2006-10); Jackie Stiles, Missouri State (1997-2001); Dominique Canty, Alabama (1995-99); Murriel Page, Florida (1994-98); Christy Smith, Arkansas (1994-98); Jamila Wideman, Stanford (1993-97); Saudia Roundtree, Georgia (1994-96); Pokey Chatman, LSU (1987-91); Jennifer Azzi (1986-90); Nancy Lieberman, Old Dominion (1976-80).\n\nThis is the greatest guard number in college women's hoops history. Two posts (Gustafson and Page) got in, but 10 is celebration of perimeter prowess and has more Wade Trophy winners (five, with six awards) than any number: Lieberman (twice), Azzi, Bird, Stiles and Plum. Two-time NCAA champion Bird has four WNBA titles, four Olympic gold medals, and is still playing at 40. Lieberman won two AIAW titles and has the nation's top point guard award named after her. The Nos. 1 and 3 Division I career scoring leaders are Plum (3,527) and Stiles (3,393). Azzi, the 1990 Final Four most outstanding player, led Stanford to its first NCAA title.\n\nOne of many talented players to wear No. 11, Elena Delle Donne scored more than 3,000 points at Delaware. G Fiume/Maryland Terrapins/Getty Images\n\n11. Teresa Weatherspoon, Louisiana Tech (1984-88)\n\nSee also: Brianna Turner, Notre Dame (2014-19); Natalie Achonwa, Notre Dame (2010-14); Elena Delle Donne, Delaware (2009-2013); Amber Harris, Xavier (2005-11); Candice Wiggins, (2004-08); Andrea Nagy, Florida International (1991-95); Donna Holt, Virginia (1984-88); Leslie Nichols, Kentucky (1982-86); Georgeann Wells, West Virginia (1982-86); Paula McGee, USC (1980-84); Anita Ortega, UCLA (1974-79).\n\nThis diverse group includes one of the best point guards, one of the most prolific scorers and the first dunker. Weatherspoon had 958 assists and 411 steals -- both program records -- in guiding Louisiana Tech to two Final Fours, winning the 1988 NCAA title and Wade Trophy. Weatherspoon played eight seasons in the WNBA, making one of the league's most famous shots in the 1999 Finals, and is now an NBA assistant with the Pelicans.\n\nDelle Donne traded NCAA title pursuit -- having signed with UConn, then changed her mind -- for following her heart. She stayed home to be near her disabled sister, and became a Delaware legend and ranks ninth on the Division I scoring list (3,039). Now with the Washington Mystics, she has been a two-time MVP in the WNBA.\n\nWiggins, a four-time WBCA All-American and 2008 Wade winner, has Stanford's highest career scoring average (19.2 PPG) and re-ignited the program with a 2008 Final Four trip. Welles was the first woman to dunk in a college game on Dec. 21, 1984, and is West Virginia's career leader in blocked shots (436).\n\n12. Carol Blazejowski, Montclair State (1974-78)\n\nSee also: Chelsea Gray, Duke (2010-14); Ivory Latta, North Carolina (2003-07); Katryna Gaither, Notre Dame (1993-97); Angela Aycock, Kansas (1991-95); Deanna Tate, Maryland (1985-89); Brantley Southers, South Carolina (1981-86); Val Still, Kentucky (1979-83); Denise Curry, UCLA (1977-81); Theresa Shank, Immaculata (1970-74).\n\nThe Blaze scored 3,199 points, while Curry had 3,198. In 1978, Blazejowski -- who went on to be longtime general manager of the WNBA's New York Liberty -- won the first Wade Trophy. But Curry's Bruins beat Blazejowski's team in the AIAW semifinals on the way to the '78 national championship. Both were three-time All-Americans. Shank led the Mighty Macs to three consecutive AIAW titles in 1972-74. Under her married name, Theresa Grentz, she also won the final AIAW championship in 1982 as head coach at Rutgers. Latta led North Carolina to the 2006 and '07 Final Fours.\n\n13. Chiney Ogwumike, Stanford (2010-14)\n\nSee also: Nina Davis, Baylor (2013-17); Danielle Robinson, Oklahoma (2007-11); Kelly Mazzante, Penn State (2000-04); Guiliana Mendiola, Washington (2000-04); Lindsay Whalen, Minnesota (2000-04); Maylana Martin, UCLA (1996-2000); Martha Parker, South Carolina (1985-89); Medina Dixon, Old Dominion (1981-85); Jill Rankin, Wayland Baptist/Tennessee (1976-80).\n\nCurrent Los Angeles Sparks forward/center Ogwumike, Stanford's career leader in points (2,737) and rebounds (1,567), went to the Final Four three times, was a three-time All-American and was the 2014 WNBA No. 1 draft pick. Robinson, who's with the Indiana Fever, was on Oklahoma's Final Four teams in 2009 and 2010. Minnesota native Whalen led the Gophers to their only Final Four, in 2004, then won four WNBA titles for the Minnesota Lynx. She's now head coach at her alma mater.\n\nNicole Powell, one of the greatest players in Pac-12 history, tallied six triple-doubles in her Cardinal career. Stephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\n14. Nicole Powell, Stanford (2000-04)\n\nSee also: Kayla Pedersen, Stanford (2007-11); Alexis Hornbuckle, Tennessee (2004-08); Deanna Nolan, Georgia (1997-2001); Cindy Blodgett, Maine (1994-98); Tina Thompson, USC (1993-97); Shannon Johnson, South Carolina (1992-96); Mary Ostrowski, Tennessee (1980-84); Julie Gross, LSU (1976-80).\n\nThree of the Pac-12's greatest are in this group, led by three-time All-American guard/forward Powell, who is in the top five at Stanford in scoring (17.3 PPG), rebounding (9.6 RPG) and assists (577). She also has six of the eight triple-doubles in Stanford history. Nobody played more minutes (4,762) for the Cardinal than Pedersen, who went to four Final Fours and is second at Stanford in career rebounding (1,266).\n\nSurprisingly, Thompson never got WBCA first-team All-American honors, despite averaging 19.7 points and 10.2 rebounds in her USC career. Her greatest glory came as a pro: The forward was the No. 1 pick in the 1997 WNBA draft, won four championships with the Houston Comets and two Olympic gold medals and averaged 15.1 PPG in a 17-year WNBA career. Blodgett, a Maine legend who had horror author Stephen King among her fans, is 13th on the NCAA Division I scoring list (3,005 points).\n\n15. Ann Meyers, UCLA (1974-78)\n\nSee also: Lauren Cox, Baylor (2016-20); Teaira McCowan, Mississippi State (2015-19); Kia Vaughn, Rutgers (2005-09); Laura Harper, Maryland (2004-08); Tan White, Mississippi State (2001-05); Jia Perkins, Texas Tech (2000-04); Asjha Jones, UConn (1998-2002); Shelly Pennefather, Villanova (1983-87); Annette Smith, Texas (1981-86); Tracey Claxton, Kansas/Old Dominion (1980-85); LaTaunya Pollard, Long Beach State (1979-83); Maree Jackson, LSU (1976-78).\n\nMeyers -- who averaged 17.4 points, 8.4 rebounds, 6.5 assists and 4.8 steals as a four-time All-American -- led UCLA to the 1978 AIAW championship and won silver for Team USA in the first Olympic women's basketball competition in 1976. The WBCA's shooting guard award is named after her.\n\nPollard, the 1983 Wade Trophy winner, is Long Beach State's career scoring leader at 3,001 points. Claxton was the most outstanding player of the 1985 Final Four for champion Old Dominion. Pennefather won the 1987 Wade Trophy, then went on to be a cloistered nun. Jackson is the mother of three-time WNBA MVP Lauren Jackson, but was a great player in her own right. In just two seasons at LSU, she compiled 1,852 points (26.5 PPG) and 1,032 rebounds (14.7 RPG). McCowan, key to Mississippi State's 2017 and '18 Final Four teams, is the Bulldogs' career rebounding leader (1,502) and is now with the Indiana Fever.\n\nSabrina Ionescu had 26 triple-doubles at Oregon, the NCAA record for men and women. AP Photo/Chris Pietsch\n\n20. Sabrina Ionescu, Oregon (2016-20)\n\nSee also: Brittney Sykes, Syracuse (2012-17); Briann January, Arizona State (2005-09); Renee Montgomery, UConn (2005-09); Kristi Toliver, Maryland (2005-09); Camille Little, North Carolina (2003-07); Alana Beard, Duke (2000-04); Shameka Christon, Arkansas (2000-04); Kara Lawson, Tennessee (1999-2003); LaNeishea Caufield, Oklahoma (1998-2002); Niesa Johnson, Alabama (1991-95); Shelley Sheetz, Colorado (1991-95); Rehema Stephens, UCLA (1989-92); Fran Harris, Texas (1982-86); Pam Leake, North Carolina (1982-86); Kim Mulkey, Louisiana Tech (1980-84); Carolyn Bush, Wayland Baptist (1973-75).\n\nThe 20s are very popular numbers, and Ionescu was one of the most popular college players. With an NCAA-record 26 triple-doubles, she is the only Division I player, women's or men's, to hit the 2K/1K/1K mark with 2,562 points, 1,040 rebounds and 1,091 assists. She led the Ducks to their first Final Four in 2019, and Pac-12 tournament titles in 2018 and 2020. Oregon would have been one of the favorites for the 2020 NCAA tournament had it not been canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Ionescu was the No. 1 pick in the 2020 WNBA draft by the New York Liberty.\n\nAs with No. 10, guards dominate No. 20. Three from the Class of 2009 went on to win WNBA championships: January, Montgomery and Toliver; the latter two also won NCAA titles. Beard won the 2004 Wade Trophy and went to two Final Fours with Duke, then had a 14-season WNBA career. Mulkey played for Louisiana Tech's AIAW and NCAA championship teams in 1981 and '82, was an assistant coach on the Lady Techsters' 1988 NCAA title team, and has won three NCAA titles as head coach at Baylor.\n\nHarris is one of the outliers at this number as a forward; she was Texas' leading scorer in 1985-86, when the 34-0 Longhorns won their national championship. Little, also a forward, went to two Final Fours with the Tar Heels and played 13 seasons in the WNBA.\n\n21. Jennifer Rizzotti, UConn (1992-96)\n\nSee also: Kalani Brown, Baylor (2015-19); Bridget Carleton, Iowa State (2015-19); Courtney Vandersloot, Gonzaga (2007-11); Chantelle Anderson, Vanderbilt (1999-2003); Stacey Dales, Oklahoma (1997-2002); Semeka Randall, Tennessee (1997-2001); Ticha Penicheiro, Old Dominion (1994-98); DeLisha Milton, Florida (1993-97); Beth Morgan, Notre Dame (1993-97); Krista Kirkland, Texas Tech (1989-93); Susan Robinson, Penn State (1988-92); Kim Pehlke, Western Kentucky (1988-92); Carolyn Jones, Auburn (1988-91); Clemette Haskins, Western Kentucky (1983-87); Rhonda Windham, Southern Cal (1982-87); Joyce Walker, LSU (1980-84); Theresa Huff, Wisconsin (1979-83); Cathy Parson, West Virginia (1979-83); Adrian Mitchell, Kansas (1975-79).\n\nPoint guards stand out here: Rizzotti helped lead UConn to its first NCAA championship in 1995, and returned to the Final Four in 1996. She's third on UConn's career assists list (637) and scored 1,540 points. Vandersloot had the highest season total of assists in Division I history (367, 10.2 per game) in leading Gonzaga to the 2011 Elite Eight. In 2020, the Chicago Sky guard became the first WNBA player to average 10.0 assists per season. Like Vandersloot (1,118), Penicheiro (939) and Dales (764) are also their school's assist leaders. Penicheiro also became one of the most prolific in assists in the WNBA, too, with 2,600 in a 15- season career.\n\nThere are also some high-level scorers at this number. LSU's Walker, (2,906), West Virginia's Parson (2,115) and Vanderbilt's Anderson (2,604) are all their school's career scoring leaders.\n\nSheryl Swoopes scored 47 points in the 1993 NCAA final, a championship-game record that still stands. AP Photo/Amy Sancetta\n\n22. Sheryl Swoopes, Texas Tech (1991-93)\n\nSee also: A'ja Wilson, South Carolina (2014-18); Jerica Coley, Florida International (2010-2014); Amy Jaeschke, Northwestern (2007-11); Alysha Clark, Belmont/Middle Tennessee (2005-10); Monica Wright, Virginia (2006-10); Matee Ajavon, Rutgers (2004-08); Stephanie White, Purdue (1995-99); Lisa Branch, Texas A&M (1992-96); MaChelle Joseph, Purdue (1988-92); Jennifer Gillom, Ole Miss (1982-86); Pam Gant, Louisiana Tech (1981-85); Anne Donovan, Old Dominion (1979-83); Holly Warlick, Tennessee (1976-80).\n\nIt's mostly a guard number, but was also worn by famed center Donovan. Swoopes spent just two seasons at Texas Tech after junior college, but became one of Division I's most iconic players. Her 47 points in the 1993 NCAA final is still the championship game record, as is her 177 total points in a single tournament (in five games, as the field didn't expand to 64 until 1994). Swoopes won four WNBA titles with the Houston Comets, three WNBA MVP awards and three Olympic gold medals.\n\nWilson led the Gamecocks to their first national championship (2017) and four SEC tournament titles. Coley is seventh on the NCAA Division I scoring list (3,107). Two of Purdue's best guards, White (1999 national champion) and Joseph (the school's all-time scoring leader at 2,405), both wore 22.\n\nChamique Holdsclaw helped lead the Lady Vols to three NCAA titles in the mid to late '90s. David E. Klutho/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n\n23. Chamique Holdsclaw, Tennessee (1995-99)\n\nSee also: Bria Holmes, West Virginia (2012-16); Aerial Powers, Michigan State (2012-16); Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, UConn (2011-15); Shoni Schimmel, Louisville (2010-14); Danielle Adams, Texas A&M (2009-11); Maya Moore, UConn (2007-11); Kelsey Griffin, Nebraska (2005-10); Kelly Miller, Georgia (1997-2001); Georgia Schweitzer, Duke (1997-2001); Nikki McCray, Tennessee (1991-95); Charlotte Smith, North Carolina (1991-95); Katy Steding, Stanford (1986-90); Clinette Jordan, Oklahoma State (1985-89); Sue Wicks, Rutgers (1984-88); Tammy Jackson, Florida (1981-85); Nell Fortner, Texas (1977-81); Bernadette Locke, Georgia (1979-81); Suzie Snider Eppers, Baylor (1973-77); Marianne Crawford Stanley, Immaculata (1972-76).\n\nMoore (3,036) and Holdsclaw (3,025) rank 10th and 11th on the NCAA Division I's 3,000-point list and are two of the greatest players of all time. The edge here goes to Holdsclaw, who won three NCAA titles to Moore's two. In a WNBA list of jersey numbers, the top spot at 23 would go to Moore, who won four titles with the Minnesota Lynx. Holdsclaw, who averaged 8.8 rebounds in her career, is also one of two players -- USC's Cheryl Miller is the other -- who led her team in scoring as a freshman in a national championship season.\n\nSmith hit one of the most famous shots in basketball history: a 3-pointer with seven-tenths of a second left to beat Louisiana Tech 60-59 in the 1994 NCAA final. She also holds the NCAA championship game record for rebounds (23).\n\nSchweitzer led Duke to its first Final Four in 1999. Adams was the most outstanding player of the 2011 Final Four when Texas A&M won its championship. Snider Eppers is Baylor's career scoring leader (3,861), which puts her fifth on the AIAW all-time list.\n\nDawn Staley led Virginia to three consecutive Final Four appearances and is the only player to be named Final Four most outstanding player from a team that didn't win a title. Getty Images\n\n24. Dawn Staley, Virginia (1988-92)\n\nSee also: Napheesa Collier, UConn (2015-19); Arike Ogunbowale, Notre Dame (2015-19); Aleighsa Welch, South Carolina (2011-15); DeWanna Bonner, Auburn (2005-09); Armintie Price, Ole Miss (2003-07); Tamika Catchings, Tennessee (1997-2001); Edwina Brown, Texas (1996-2000); Kristin Folkl, Stanford (1994-98); Cornelia Gayden, LSU (1991-95); Natalie Williams, UCLA (1990-94); Dawn Staley, Virginia (1988-92); Kerry Bascom, UConn (1987-91); Lorri Johnson, Pittsburgh (1987-91); Clarissa Davis, Texas (1986-89); Adrienne Goodson, Old Dominion (1984-88); Chris Moreland, Duke (1984-88); Molly McGuire, Oklahoma (1979-83); Bev Smith, Oregon (1978-82); Linda Waggoner, Texas (1976-80).\n\nIt's quite a battle here for the top spot among guards Staley and Ogunbowale and forward Catchings. Staley, a three-time All-American like Catchings, had 2,135 points, 729 assists and 454 steals, was a two-time national player of the year and led Virginia to three Final Four appearances. She is the only Final Four most outstanding player from a losing team (1991). Her pro career included three Olympic gold medals, and she won the 2017 NCAA title as head coach at South Carolina.\n\nCatchings helped the Lady Vols win the 1998 national championship and make the 2000 NCAA final. She's fourth on Tennessee's career points list (2,113) and sixth in rebounding (1,004) despite a torn ACL limiting her to 17 of the Lady Vols' 34 games her senior season. She went on to a luminous pro career, winning the 2012 WNBA title with Indiana and four gold medals with the U.S. Olympic team.\n\nOgunbowale is Notre Dame's career scoring leader (2,626 points) and hit two shots heard 'round the world in the 2018 Final Four to beat UConn in the semifinals and Mississippi State in the final. She wore No. 2 as a freshman, but changed to 24 the rest of her Notre Dame career and now with the Dallas Wings. She led the WNBA in scoring average (22.7) in 2020.\n\nFolkl and Williams are two of the greatest athletes in NCAA history as All-Americans in basketball and volleyball, and both played in the WNBA. Bonner, now with the Connecticut Sun, is Auburn's career leader in points (2,162) and is second in rebounds (1,047), and won two WNBA titles in Phoenix. Davis was the most outstanding player of the 1986 Final Four for Texas.\n\nPlay ESPN Women's Tournament Challenge for free!

Alyssa Thomas, Maryland (2010-14)\n\nSee also: Asia Durr, Louisville (2015-19); Makayla Epps, Kentucky (2013-17); Tiffany Mitchell, South Carolina (2012-16); Marissa Coleman, Maryland (2004-09); Monique Currie, Duke (2001-06); Cappie Pondexter, Rutgers (2001-06); Svetlana Abrosimova, UConn (1997-2001); Becky Hammon, Colorado State (1995-99); Debra Williams, Louisiana Tech (1992-96); Merlakia Jones, Florida (1991-95); Ruthie Bolton, Auburn (1985-89); Vicky Bullett, Maryland (1985-89); Andrea Lloyd, Texas (1983-87); Franthea Price, Iowa (1986-90).\n\nA particularly special number at Maryland, as three of the greatest Terps -- Thomas, Coleman and Bullett -- wore 25. Three-time All-American forward Thomas, who plays with the WNBA's Connecticut Sun, is Maryland's career leader in points (2,356) and rebounds (1,235) and led the Terps to the 2014 Final Four. Coleman, who's third in scoring at Maryland (2,205), was on the Terps' 2006 national championship team. And Bullett led Maryland to the 1989 Final Four.\n\nLloyd was on Texas' 1986 NCAA title team. Hammon, Colorado State's all-time scoring leader (2,740), went undrafted by the WNBA in 1999, but had a 16-season career and is now an NBA assistant coach with the Spurs. A fan favorite at UConn, Abrosimova was a three-time All-American who helped the Huskies to the 2000 NCAA title but had her senior season cut short by a foot injury. She went on to play 10 seasons in the WNBA, winning a championship with Seattle in 2010. Pondexter and Currie were second and third in the 2006 WNBA draft and had long pro careers, with Pondexter winning two titles with Phoenix. Durr, who is with the New York Liberty, is second on Louisville's all-time points list (2,485) and was two-time ACC player of the year.\n\nLike UConn's Breanna Stewart, Stanford's Nneka Ogwumike played in four Final Fours. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n\n30. Breanna Stewart, UConn 2012-16)\n\nSee also: Nneka Ogwumike, Stanford (2008-12); Helen Darling, Penn State (1996-2000); Amanda Wilson, Louisiana Tech (1995-99); Adia Barnes, Arizona (1994-98); Kate Starbird, Stanford (1993-97); Katie Smith, Ohio State (1992-96); Heather Burge, Virginia (1989-93); Tia Paschal, Florida State (1989-93); Bridgette Gordon, Tennessee (1985-89); Michelle Edwards, Iowa (1984-88); Maurtice Ivy, Nebraska (1984-88); Pam McGee, USC (1980-84).\n\nNo one will out-do Stewart, who was Final Four most outstanding player four times in leading UConn to four championships. She averaged 17.6 points and 7.8 rebounds in her Huskies career. Now with the Seattle Storm, she has won the WNBA's MVP award, two league titles and an Olympic gold medal while still just 26 years old. Tennessee's Gordon (1989 Final Four MOP) and USC's McGee each won two NCAA titles.\n\nOgwumike won a WNBA MVP award in leading the Los Angeles Sparks to the 2016 title, and she went to four Final Fours with Stanford while averaging 17.2 points and 8.5 rebounds. Starbird is in Stanford's top 10 in points (2,215), assists (437), and steals (252) and led the Cardinal to three Final Fours. Burge teamed with twin sister Heidi on Virginia's three Final Four teams. Smith, a three-time Olympic gold medalist who won two WNBA titles, led Ohio State to its only Final Four in 1993.\n\nCheryl Miller, flanked by Paula McGee, left, and Pamela McGee, right, and USC cut down the championship nets in 1984. Peter Read Miller /Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n\n31. Cheryl Miller, USC (1982-86)\n\nSee also: Kristine Anigwe, Cal (2015-19); Stefanie Dolson (UConn, 2010-14); Tina Charles, UConn (2006-10); Wendy Palmer, Virginia (1992-96); Clara Jackson, Ole Miss (1990-94); Lynette Woodard, Kansas (1977-81).\n\nThere are so many players of whom you wonder \"What could have been?\" if the WNBA had existed in their primes. Naismith Hall of Fame marvels Miller and Woodard top the list. Miller led USC to the 1983 and '84 NCAA titles, and the '86 Final Four. She and Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw are the only freshmen in the NCAA era to lead a team in scoring in a national championship season. Miller was a 6-2 forward who excelled at everything, averaging 23.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 3.6 steals and 2.5 blocked shots. She suffered a knee injury not long after her college career ended and went into broadcasting. Might her path have been different if she could have rehabbed knowing she had a U.S. pro league to play in? She has coached in the WNBA and collegiately.\n\nWoodard, a 6-foot guard, is the AIAW's career scoring leader (3,649), and like Miller, did it all: averaging 26.3 points, 12.5 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 3.8 steals for the Jayhawks. She won 1984 Olympic gold and played overseas. In 1985, she became the first woman to play for the Harlem Globetrotters. Woodard was able to play -- starting a couple months before turning 38 years old -- in the WNBA's first two seasons, 1997 with Cleveland and '98 with Detroit, appearing in 55 games overall.\n\nCharles and Dolson each won two NCAA titles while at UConn, and are currently in the WNBA.\n\n32. Katrina McClain, Georgia (1983-87)\n\nSee also: Shatori Walker-Kimbrough, Maryland (2013-17); Jewell Loyd, Notre Dame (2012-15); Nikki Blue, UCLA (2002-06); Cheryl Ford, Louisiana Tech (1999-2003); LaToya Thomas, Mississippi State (1999-2003); Swin Cash, UConn (1998-2002); Angie Welle, Iowa State (1999-2002); Katie Douglas, Purdue (1997-2001); Stacey Lovelace, Purdue (1992-96); Tammi Reiss, Virginia (1988-92); Daedra Charles, Tennessee (1988-91); Andrea Stinson, NC State (1988-91); Nikita Lowry, Ohio State (1985-89); Cherie Nelson, Southern Cal (1985-89); Suzie McConnell, Penn State (1984-88); Lillie Mason, Western Kentucky (1981-86); Kym Hampton, Arizona State (1980-84); Cindy Noble, Tennessee (1978-81).\n\nA two-time All-American, McClain is third on Georgia's career points list (2,195), second in rebounding (1,193) and first in field-goal percentage (62.0). In the postseason, she was even more accurate: McClain holds the record for NCAA tournament career field-goal percentage (minimum 10 games played) at 71.4 percent (60 of 84) in 12 games. She helped Georgia get to the 1985 NCAA final, and as a U.S. Olympian won two gold medals and a bronze. The WBCA's power forward award is named after her.\n\nPenn State's McConnell is the Division I leader in career assists (1,307). Charles won two NCAA titles with Tennessee, and Cash (who wore 23 her freshman year) did the same at UConn. Douglas helped Purdue win its 1999 NCAA title and make the 2001 final. Notre Dame's Loyd and Virginia's Reiss each made it to three consecutive Final Fours. Cash (three times), Loyd (twice) and Douglas are also WNBA champions; Loyd is still playing for Seattle. Thomas, the 2003 WNBA No. 1 draft pick, was a four-time All-American and Mississippi State's career scoring leader (2,981), while Welle is tops on Iowa State's scoring (2,149) and rebounding (1,209) lists.\n\n33. Seimone Augustus, LSU (2002-06)\n\nSee also: Katie Lou Samuelson, UConn (2015-19); Natasha Howard, Florida State (2010-14); Maggie Lucas, Penn State (2010-14); Tiffany Jackson, Texas (2003-07); Sophia Young, Baylor (2002-06); Tanisha Wright, Penn State (2001-05); Shea Ralph, UConn (1996-2001); Tamecka Dixon, Kansas (1993-97); Clarisse Machanguana, Old Dominion (1994-97); Jamelle Elliott, UConn (1992-96); Lisa Leslie, USC (1990-94); Sarah Behn, Boston College, 1989-93; Valorie Whiteside, Appalachian State (1984-88); Kamie Ethridge, Texas (1982-86); Wanda Ford, Drake (1982-86); Joni Davis, Missouri (1981-85); Debbie Lytle, Maryland (1979-83); Carol Menken, Oregon State (1978-81).\n\nTwo of the top 33s -- Augustus and Leslie -- were hometown heroes in college. Augustus stayed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to lead LSU to its first Final Four in 2004, starting the program's streak of five national semifinal appearances in a row. The guard is second at LSU in scoring (2,702 points), was a three-time All-American and twice won the Wade Trophy. As a pro, she won four WNBA titles with the Minnesota Lynx and three Olympic gold medals; she's currently with the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nLeslie is from greater Los Angeles, where she played collegiately with USC, and in the WNBA with the Sparks. The center is much better known for her professional number -- 9 -- which she wore in winning two WNBA titles, three WNBA MVP awards and four Olympic gold medals. As No. 33 for USC, she averaged 20.1 points, 10.1 rebounds and 2.7 blocks.\n\nEthridge was the point guard who in 1986 guided Texas to the NCAA title and won the Wade Trophy. Ford is second in Division I history in total rebounds (1,815) but first in rebounding average (15.5 RPG). Ralph was the Final Four's most outstanding player in 2000 for UConn's title team, and is a Huskies assistant now along with Elliott, a 1995 national champion.\n\nBill Frakes/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images\n\n34. Sylvia Fowles, LSU (2004-08)\n\nSee also: Victoria Dunlap, Kentucky (2007-11); Tasha Humphrey, Georgia (2004-08); Tamika Williams, UConn (1998-2002); Phylesha Whaley, Oklahoma (1996-2000); Heidi Gillingham, Vanderbilt (1990-94); Tonya Sampson, North Carolina (1990-94); Maggie Davis Stinnett, Baylor (1986-91); Sonja Henning, Stanford (1987-91); Becky Jackson, Auburn (1980-84).\n\nFowles is one of the most dominant centers in women's hoops history, going to four Final Fours. A two-time All-American, she averaged 15.5 points and 10.9 rebounds at LSU, where she's the career leader in rebounds (1,570) and blocks (321). Fowles has won two WNBA titles with the Minnesota Lynx, was league MVP in 2017 and has three Olympic gold medals.\n\nFowles is 6-6, but Gillingham -- who led Vanderbilt to its only Final Four in 1993 -- is one of the tallest women to ever play at 6-10. Williams won two NCAA titles at UConn. Henning is Stanford's career leader in assists (757) and led the Cardinal with 21 points in their 1990 NCAA final victory. Jackson is Auburn's career leader in rebounds (1,118) and field goal percentage (60.2), and second in points (2,068).\n\n35. Angel McCoughtry, Louisville (2005-09)\n\nSee also: *Charli Collier, Texas (2018-21); Victoria Vivians, Mississippi State (2014-18); Jonquel Jones, George Washington (2012-16); Jordan Hooper, Nebraska (2010-14); Coco Miller, Georgia (1997-2001); Tamicha Jackson, Louisiana Tech (1996-2000).\n\nThis is the least popular jersey number in the 30s, but it has a superstar player attached to it who turned her program into a national contender. McCoughtry is Louisville's career leader in points (2,779), rebounds (1,261) and steals (481). The guard/forward led the Cardinals to their first Final Four in 2009, when she was the WNBA's No. 1 draft pick. She has played in three WNBA Finals with Atlanta, one with current team Las Vegas and has won two Olympic gold medals.\n\nVivians also hugely impacted her program, helping Mississippi State to its first Final Four in 2017, and again in 2018. She is second in Bulldog history with 2,527 points, and currently plays for the Indiana Fever in the WNBA. Collier, who is leaving Texas after three seasons, could be the top pick in the 2021 WNBA draft.\n\n40. Nancy Dunkle, Cal State Fullerton (1973-77)\n\nSee also: Kayla Alexander, Syracuse (2009-13); Shekinna Stricklen, Tennessee (2008-12); Tere Williams, Virginia Tech 1997-2001; Tajama Abraham, George Washington 1993-97; Joy Holmes, Purdue (1987-91); Genia Miller, Cal State Fullerton (1987-91); Wendy Scholtens, Vanderbilt (1987-91); Nora Lewis, Louisiana Tech (1985-89); Rosie Walker, Stephen F. Austin (1978-80).\n\nThe two greatest players in Cal State Fullerton history were centers who wore 40. Dunkle (1,519 points, 729 rebounds) was a three-time All-American who won a silver medal with the 1976 Olympic team. Miller, a 1991 All-American, is the Titans' career leader in points (2,415), rebounds (1,162) and blocks (428).\n\nWalker was a two-time All-American who made the 1980 Olympic team that didn't compete in the U.S.-boycotted Moscow Games. Lewis played for Louisiana Tech's 1988 NCAA title team. Scholtens is Vanderbilt's career leader in rebounds (1,272) and is second in scoring (2,602). Stricklen, who's now with the Atlanta Dream, finished her Tennessee career eighth in points (1,882) playing on coach Pat Summitt's last team.\n\n41. Pam Kelly, Louisiana Tech (1978-82)\n\nSee also: Alaina Coates, South Carolina (2013-17); Stacy Stephens, Texas 2000-04; Jolene Anderson, Wisconsin (2004-08); Jessie Stomski, Wisconsin (1998-2002).\n\nIt's not a popular number, but a superstar represents it: Louisiana Tech legend Kelly, a forward, was a three-time All-American, and is first in scoring (2,979) and rebounding (1,511) for the program. A teammate four years with Angela Turner, Kelly won the 1981 AIAW and 1982 NCAA titles and went to two other Final Fours.\n\nCoates was part of the 2017 Gamecock national championship team and also went to the 2015 Final Four. Stephens led the Longhorns to the 2003 Final Four. Anderson and Stomski rank first and third, respectively, on Wisconsin's career scoring list.\n\nBrittney Griner, who helped lead Baylor to a 40-0 record during its 2012 national championship season, is the NCAA leader in blocked shots.

Brittney Griner, Baylor (2009-13)\n\nSee also: Jantel Lavender, Ohio State (2007-11); Nikki Teasley, North Carolina (1997-2002); Nykesha Sales, (UConn, 1994-98); Carol Ann Shudlick, Minnesota (1990-94); Linda Burgess, Alabama (1990-92); Patricia Hoskins, Mississippi Valley State (1985-89); Renee Kelly, Missouri (1983-87); Barbara Kennedy, Clemson (1978-82); Peggie Gillom, Ole Miss (1976-80); Inge Nissen, Old Dominion (1976-80).\n\nGriner has been a game-changer on both ends, a premier center who can dunk and protect the rim. She is the NCAA Division I leader in blocked shots (748) and fourth in points (3,283). Griner led Baylor to a 40-0 championship season in 2012 when she was the Final Four's most outstanding player. A two-time Wade Trophy winner and three-time All-American, Griner was the No. 1 WNBA draft pick in 2013. She won the WNBA title with Phoenix in 2014 and an Olympic gold medal in 2016.\n\nHoskins is fifth on the NCAA's list of career points (3,122) and fourth in rebounds (1,662). Lavender, currently with the Indiana Fever in the WNBA, averaged 20.7 points and 10.7 rebounds at Ohio State, where she was a four-time Big Ten player of the year. Nissen starred for ODU's two AIAW championship teams in 1979 and '80.\n\n43. Venus Lacy, Louisiana Tech (1987-90)\n\nSee also: Alison Bales, Duke (2003-07); Ann Strother, UConn (2002-06); Shyra Ely (2001-05); Tasha Pointer, Rutgers (1997-2001); Alicia Thompson, Texas Tech (1994-98); Vicki Hall, Texas (1988-93); Eugenia Connor, Ole Miss (1981-85); Linda Page, NC State (1981-85); Sue Galkantas, Florida State (1980-84).\n\nLacy spent one season at Old Dominion, then transferred to Louisiana Tech and won the 1988 national championship. Despite playing just three seasons at Louisiana Tech, she is fourth in program history in scoring (2,004) and rebounding (1,125) and was on the 1996 Olympic team.\n\nGalkantas is Florida State's career scoring leader (2,323) and is second in rebounds (1,006).\n\n44. Cynthia Cooper, USC\n\nSee also: Ruth Hamblin, Oregon State (2012-16); Chasity Melvin, NC State (1994-98); Barb Franke, Wisconsin (1991-96); Tracey Hall, Ohio State (1984-88); Erica Westbrooks, Louisiana Tech (1984-88); Renee Dennis, Virginia Tech; 1983-87; Cassandra Crumpton, Alabama (1982-84); Carolyn Thompson, Texas Tech (1980-84); Cindy Brognon, Mercer/Tennessee (1976-79); Retha Swindell, Texas (1975-79); Tara Heiss, Maryland (1974-78); Patricia Roberts, Tennessee (1976-77).\n\nCooper, a guard, was a key component but overshadowed at USC by teammates like Cheryl Miller and twins Pam and Paula McGee. Yet Cooper went on to have the greatest pro career of any of the players on USC's 1983 and '84 NCAA championship teams. She had 1,559 points, 381 assists and 256 steals at USC, won Olympic gold in 1988 and bronze in '92, and is one of four USC women's players in the Naismith Hall of Fame. Like fellow USC Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie, Cooper is better known for her WNBA number: 14. A longtime star overseas in Italy, Cooper entered the WNBA at age 34 and led the Houston Comets to the league's first four championships in 1997-2000. A two-time WNBA MVP, she has gone on to coach in the WNBA and collegiately, including at her alma mater, and is currently at Texas Southern.\n\nMelvin is in the top five in points (2,042) and rebounds (1,020) for NC State, and led the Wolfpack to their only Final Four in 1998. Westbrooks was Final Four MVP for 1988 NCAA champion Louisiana Tech. Brognon is second on the AIAW's all-time scoring list (3,204).\n\n45. Lusia Harris, Delta State (1973-77)\n\nSee also: Borislava Hristova, Washington State (2015-20); Noelle Quinn, UCLA (2003-07); Jocelyn Penn, South Carolina (1998-2003); Janet Harris, Georgia (1981-85); June Olkowski, Rutgers (1978-82).\n\nTwo great players named Harris -- unrelated -- are tops at this number. Lusia Harris, a center from Mississippi, was the driving force for the Delta State dynasty of the 1970s. She played for legendary coach Margaret Wade, for whom the Wade Trophy is named, and won the AIAW championship in 1975, '76 and '77. She was the tournament's most valuable player three times and a three-time All-American, averaging 25.9 points and 14.5 rebounds in her career. She won silver with the U.S. team in the first Olympic women's basketball competition in 1976. Harris was selected in the seventh round of the 1977 NBA draft by New Orleans (137th pick) but declined to try out for the team.\n\nJanet Harris, a three-time All-American post player from Chicago, led Georgia to two Final Fours and is the program's all-time leader in points (2,641) and rebounds (1,396). Olkowski helped Rutgers win the last AIAW title in 1982.\n\n50. Rebecca Lobo, UConn (1991-95)\n\nSee also: Jessica Davenport, Ohio State (2003-07); Sandora Irvin, TCU (2001-05); Shereka Wright, Purdue (2000-04); Tangela Smith, Iowa (1994-98); Delmonica DeHorney, Arkansas (1987-91); Vickie Orr, Auburn (1985-89); Anucha Browne, Northwestern (1981-85); Kris Kirchner, Rutgers (1980-81); Genia Beasley, NC State (1976-80).\n\nLobo, a center, starred for the UConn team that changed the sport, winning the 1995 NCAA title to start what is now an 11-championship dynasty. Browne is Northwestern's career scoring leader (2,307) and averaged 30.5 points her senior season. Beasley is the Wolfpack's career leader in points (2,367) and rebounds (1,245). Kirchner starred her first three seasons at Maryland wearing No. 53; she transferred to Rutgers and became an All-American wearing No. 50.\n\n51. Janice Lawrence, Louisiana Tech (1980-84)\n\nSee also: Jessica Breland, North Carolina (2006-2011); Sydney Colson, Texas A&M (2007-11); Latasha Byears, DePaul (1994-96); Karen Jennings, Nebraska (1989-93); Christy Winters, Maryland (1986-90).\n\nThe most outstanding player at the first NCAA Women's Final Four in 1982, Lawrence scored 20 points in the national championship game victory. The center is second in scoring (2,403) and fifth in rebounding (1,097) in Louisiana Tech's vast cast of stars, and she won Olympic gold in 1984.\n\nJennings is the most decorated Nebraska player, winning the 1993 Wade Trophy and Big Eight player of the year honors twice. Breland overcame cancer, which forced her to redshirt a season at North Carolina, and she is still playing in the WNBA. So is Colson, who helped Texas A&M win its 2011 NCAA title.\n\nVal Whiting won two national championships and played in three Final Fours for Stanford.

Val Whiting, Stanford (1989-93)\n\nSee also: Kara Wolters, UConn (1993-97); Tyasha Harris, South Carolina (2016-20); Cinietra Henderson, Texas (1989-93); Liz Shimek, Michigan State (2002-06).\n\nWhiting, a center, played for both Stanford national championship teams, and went to three Final Fours. She is sixth in both career points (2,077) and rebounds (1,134) for the Cardinal. Wolters, also a center, was on UConn's 1995 NCAA title team, and Harris was the point guard for the Gamecocks' 2017 national championship squad. Shimek helped the Spartans make their only Final Four appearance, in 2005.\n\n53. Cindy Brown, Long Beach State (1983-87)\n\nSee also: Kendra Wecker, Kansas State (2001-05); Jayme Olson, Iowa State (1994-98); Dana Johnson, Tennessee (1991-95); Sheila Foster, South Carolina (1978-82); Valerie Walker, Cheyney (1978-82).\n\nBrown, a forward/center, was a two-time All-American who led the 49ers to their first Final Four appearance in 1987; her 60-point performance in February of that year is tied for the Division I single-game record with Minnesota's Rachel Banham (2016). Walker, a forward who also was a two-time All-American, led Cheyney -- then coached by C. Vivian Stringer -- to the first NCAA championship game in 1982.\n\n54. Plenette Pierson, Texas Tech (1999-03)\n\nSee also: Toni Foster, Iowa (1989-93); Terry Dorner, Rutgers (1980-82).\n\nSorry, 54, but you're the number with the least star power. The two programs with the most titles, UConn and Tennessee, have never even had a player wear 54. Pierson wore it compiling 1,602 points and 787 rebounds at Texas Tech, and kept it early in her 15-season WNBA career. The forward switched to 23, 33 and 22 the rest of the way, winning two championships in Detroit and one in Minnesota. Foster led Iowa in scoring and rebounding for three seasons, culminating in the program's lone Final Four trip her senior year of 1993. Dorner was the Scarlet Knights' leading scorer on their 1981-82 AIAW championship team.\n\n55. Vickie Johnson, Louisiana Tech (1992-1996)\n\nSee also: Nicky Anosike, Tennessee (2004-08); Tammy Sutton-Brown, Rutgers (1997-2001); Michi Atkins, Texas Tech (1992-96); Sheri Sam, Vanderbilt (1992-96); Lorri Bauman, Drake (1980-84).\n\nJohnson, now head coach of the Dallas Wings after a 13-season WNBA playing career, was a two-time All-American who is sixth in scoring (1,960) at Louisiana Tech. The guard had a double-double in the 1994 national championship game that the Lady Techsters lost on a buzzer-beater. Bauman is sixth in Division I career scoring with 3,115 points, and her 50-point game in the inaugural NCAA tournament in 1982 is still the single-game tournament record. Anosike won two NCAA titles with Tennessee."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michelle-Akers", "page_content": "Michelle Akers, in full Michelle Anne Akers, (born February 1, 1966, Santa Clara, California, U.S.), American football (soccer) player who was named Female Player of the 20th Century by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), an honour she shared with Chinese player Sun Wen. Akers is considered one of the pioneers in the development of women\u2019s football in the United States and the world.\n\nAkers played football at Shorecrest High School outside Seattle, where she was a three-time All-American, but it was at the University of Central Florida (UCF) that her career took off. There she became a four-time All-American and the all-time leading scorer in the university\u2019s history. In 1988\u201389 she was named UCF\u2019s Athlete of the Year and became the first woman to receive the Hermann Trophy, presented annually to the best male and female players in collegiate soccer. On August 18, 1985, Akers made her debut for the U.S. women\u2019s national team in the squad\u2019s first-ever international match, against Italy. Three days later, in a draw with Denmark, she scored the first goal in the team\u2019s history.\n\nBritannica Quiz I Am the Greatest (Athlete)\n\nFrom 1985 to 1990, playing centre-forward, she scored 15 goals in 24 games. In 1991 she set a U.S. team single-year scoring record by tallying 39 goals in 26 appearances, with 10 of those goals coming during the inaugural FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup competition, earning Akers the Golden Boot award as the tournament\u2019s leading scorer. She also scored five goals against Taiwan in quarterfinal match (a Women\u2019s World Cup single-game record) and two in the U.S. victory over Norway in the championship game. For her stunning performance throughout the final rounds, she was awarded the Silver Ball as the tournament\u2019s second best player, behind teammate Carin Garbara.\n\nAkers and U.S. women\u2019s team failed to live up to expectations in the 1995 World Cup, finishing in third place. Redemption came soon, at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, the first Olympic Games in which women\u2019s soccer was included. Then playing as a midfielder, Akers scored a crucial penalty kick in the semifinal match against Norway that tied the game and sent it into extra time, where Shannon MacMillan scored the goal that propelled the U.S. team on to the gold medal match and eventual victory over China.\n\nThe 1999 World Cup title, won by the United States at home, was Akers\u2019s last hurrah as a member of the national team. She scored a goal in the 2\u20130 semifinal victory over Brazil and was awarded the Bronze Ball as the tournament\u2019s third most-valuable player.\n\nHaving scored 105 goals in 153 international matches, Akers ended her 15-year career prior to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sidney. Her decision was mainly motivated by a shoulder injury, but she also had struggled with chronic fatigue syndrome since 1991. In 2004 Akers and Mia Hamm were the only women named to FIFA 100, a list of the 125 greatest living football players compiled by Brazilian great Pel\u00e9 to celebrate FIFA\u2019s centenary. Upon retirement, Akers continued her involvement in football by writing books and conducting clinics. In 2022 she became the assistant coach and player development coach for the Orlando Pride of the National Women\u2019s Soccer League.

The program has won two NCAA titles, been to 13 Women's Final Fours and won 23 Pac-12 regular-season and 13 league tournament titles. And some of the best players in women's college basketball history have competed for the Cardinal.\n\nFrom Nerd Nation to national champions, here are the top 10 Stanford players of the VanDerveer era, which began in 1985.\n\nA four-time All-American, Candice Wiggins' 41 points in the regional semifinals led Stanford to the 2008 Final Four, the Cardinal's first appearance in the national semis in 11 years. Kirby Lee/WireImage\n\n1. Candice Wiggins: 2004-08, guard\n\nA four-time WBCA All-American, she has the highest career scoring average (19.2 PPG) in program history, and leads in 3-pointers (295), free throws (556) and steals (281). She led Stanford to the Elite Eight as a freshman and sophomore. As a senior, she had 41 points against No. 1 seed Maryland in the regional final to send Stanford to its first Final Four in 11 years. Wiggins also had 44 points in the second round of that 2008 NCAA tournament, 25 points and 13 rebounds in beating UConn in the national semifinals, and she won the Wade Trophy. The magic ended with a loss to Tennessee in the NCAA final, but Wiggins had returned Stanford to the national spotlight.\n\n2. Chiney Ogwumike: 2010-14, forward\n\nIt's hard to separate the Ogwumike sisters; it feels like they should be tied. But at Stanford, the statistical edge goes to younger sister Chiney, who is the Cardinal's all-time leader in points (2,737) and rebounds (1,567) and is third in blocked shots (202). A three-time All-American, she helped Stanford make three Final Four appearances. Her 24 rebounds against Oregon in 2014 is the program's single-game record. In 2014, she won the Wooden Award and was the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft.\n\n3. Jennifer Azzi: 1986-90, guard\n\nAzzi was a dynamic force on the great 1989-90 team who led Stanford to its first Final Four, first NCAA title and put the Cardinal on the map in women's basketball. Winner of the Wade Trophy and Naismith Award in 1990, the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, native lived out the dream of winning the national championship in nearby Knoxville and was the Final Four's most outstanding player. She is the program leader in 3-point shooting percentage (minimum of 150 made) at .452, is second in assists (751) and third in steals (271). She is also 12th in total points (1,634). Her 16 assists against BYU as a freshman remains Stanford's single-game record.\n\n4. Nicole Powell: 2000-04, guard/forward\n\nWiggins got Stanford back to the Final Four after a drought, but Powell was the player most responsible for keeping the Cardinal at an elite level when the program went through what was -- by Stanford's lofty standards -- a bit of a down period, with two NCAA second-round losses. By Powell's senior year, Stanford was back in the Elite Eight. A three-time All-American, Powell is the most versatile player in program history: fourth in scoring average (17.3 PPG), second in rebounding average (9.6 RPG) and fifth in total assists (577). She also has six of the eight triple-doubles in Stanford history.\n\nNicole Powell is the most versatile player in Stanford history, tallying six of the program's eight triple-doubles. AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki\n\n5. Nneka Ogwumike: 2008-12, forward\n\nIf we were including professional careers in this ranking, Nneka likely would vault to No. 1, with her 2016 WNBA MVP and league title. The eldest Ogwumike brought sensational athleticism and a perpetually sunny attitude to Stanford, which she still has in the WNBA. A three-time All-American, she helped Stanford make four consecutive Final Four appearances. She is fifth in both scoring average (17.2 PPG) and rebounding average (8.5 RPG), and third in total points (2,491). She was the WNBA's No. 1 draft pick in 2012.\n\n6. Val Whiting: 1989-93, center\n\nKnown for her powerful inside presence, she was on both Stanford national championship teams, and went to three Final Fours. Whiting is sixth in both career points (2,077) and rebounds (1,134), and fourth in blocked shots. Incidentally, before Elena Delle Donne was a superstar at Ursuline Academy in Wilmington, Delaware, Whiting was a standout there.\n\n7. Kate Starbird: 1993-97, guard/forward\n\nA 6-foot-2 player with guard skills, Starbird had a wry sense of humor and a knack for scoring. She is one of two Stanford players (the other is Wiggins) to score 40 or more points in a game twice in her career. Starbird finished fourth all-time in points at Stanford (2,215), fifth in steals (252) and 10th in assists (437). She helped Stanford make three Final Four appearances on teams loaded with talent (including Kristin Folkl, who misses this list because she played just two full seasons and part of another due to her commitment to volleyball) and personality (including the irrepressibly hilarious Vanessa Nygaard).\n\nNneka Ogwumike was the No. 1 pick in the 2012 WNBA draft. She ranks fifth in career scoring and rebounding averages. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images\n\n8.
