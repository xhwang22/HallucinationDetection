He had an illustrious career as a journalist before he entered the political realm as a member of Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N). He was appointed information minister by Nawaz Sharif in the latter\u2019s 1997 cabinet.\n\nIn 1999, following the coup by former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf, Mushahid\u2019s house was stormed by soldiers the very same day and he was placed under house arrest and then behind bars. He was released in 2000. Surprisingly, following his release, he defected to Pakistan Muslim League - Quaid (PML-Q), which became known as the \u2018King\u2019s party\u2019 because of its association with Musharraf.\n\nBefore Mushahid decided to experiment with politics, he had a vibrant career in academia as well as journalism. He also trained diplomats at the Pakistan Administrative Staff College, a civil service academy. After this, he taught at Punjab University \u2013 and was dismissed for his opposition to military rule from the institution. In 1982, he was made editor of a daily called \u2018The Muslim\u2019. He has written regularly for the Times of India and The Hindustan Times, along with being published in the New York Times and Washington Post amongst other publications.\n\nIn 1997, Mushahid entered politics and was elected a Senator on a PML-N ticket. He was also made the information minister by Nawaz, and ushered Pakistan through some of its worst international crises \u2013 including the conducting of nuclear tests followed by crippling sanctions and the Kargil War.\n\nPrior to his 1997 cabinet induction, he was an advisor to the then prime minister Nawaz. According to Nawaz, Mushahid was the first person who told him to go ahead with the nuclear tests although this statement has been contested.\n\nAfter his arrest following the 1999 coup, Mushahid remained imprisoned for 440 days and was declared a \u2018Prisoner of Conscience\u2019 by Amnesty International.

BRI and CPEC were living examples of development initiatives launched by China.\n\nDr Sumeera Imran from NDU said GDI reflected President Xi\u2019s agenda of global responsibility. It was a model initiative that aimed to boost cooperation.\n\nDr Wang Shida from the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) said that the essence of President Xi Jinping\u2019s Global Development Initiative was based on some core objectives, which included adhering to priorities, inclusivity, innovation drive, action-oriented approaches, capacity building, and

He said this was for the first time that an alliance had been made against \u201cone political party\u201d.\n\nHe said that politicians must be handled with political means only and not through sticks.\n\nHe opined that it was because of the use of administrative measures and sticks that it had become difficult now to handle Imran Khan. \u201cNow the opposition is a force which could not be suppressed through sticks.\u201d\n\nSenator Syed said traditional establishment whose allies were judiciary, bureaucracy, business tycoons and media did not exist as it was now \u201cdivided\u201d.\n\nHe regretted that as politicians did not play their role to resolve the crisis, it was now the judiciary which was playing that role.\n\n\u2018New establishment\u2019\n\nHe said that a \u201cnew establishment\u201d was evolving and it would take time.\n\nHe said that it was true that political parties had weakened but the \u201call-powerful establishment\u201d also no longer existed because of the emergence of multiple power centres.\n\n\u201cTraditional establishment has been replaced by five centres of power \u2014 the army chief, chief justice, Asif Zardari in Karachi, Nawaz Sharif in London and Imran Khan in Lahore,\u201d he observed.\n\nHe said that it was for the first time that Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were demonstrating anti-establishment thinking.\n\nThe veteran politician said other parties like PML-N had made mistake by focusing on \u201celectables\u201d, but the PTI had mobilised youths, the middle class and silent majority in Punjab and KP and created \u201cspace\u201d for them in electoral politics.\n\nHe said the PML-N had a \u201cserious misunderstanding\u201d about the popularity of the PTI as it did not realise that people in Lahore and Peshawar were fed up with traditional politics.\n\nIt was in the DNA of all politicians since Zulfikar Ali Bhutto that they wanted their \u201cown\u201d army chief but they did not have an understanding of the institution of the army, he said, adding that the politicians also did not understand that this institution even did not spare their own chief as Ayub was removed by Gen Yahya, who was removed by Gen Gul Hasan.\n\nSimilarly, he said, it was not the lawyers\u2019 movement that removed Gen Musharraf, but it was the \u201cdeep state\u201d which removed him because of his policy towards India. \u201cThe army chief had no personal loyalty as he is loyal to the institution.\u201d\n\nHe said that the Pakistan Oppressed Nations Movement (PONM) was launched by the then establishment as the then army chief Gen Jahangir Karamat had used a sense of deprivation among smaller provinces in his speech as one of the charges against then premier Nawaz Sharif.\n\nBut, he said that Gen Karamat, who was asked to resign by the then PM Sharif, should have been handled \u201cdifferently\u201d.\n\nAbout the Panama case, he said that Nawaz Sharif had followed legal advice and treated the case as legal despite the fact that it was a political case. \u201cNawaz Sharif should have boycotted the Supreme Court hearings when the then chief justice uttered the words of \u2018Sicilian mafia\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that it was the same mistake that then PM Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had committed. \u201cBoth the cases were of power politics and not legal one\u2026they should have been fought politically.\u201d\n\nHe did not agree with a questioner about the current economic crisis. \u201cThe core issue is of politics and the economic crisis is its consequence,\u201d he said.\n\nBesides IMF had bailed out Pakistan 23 times as successive rulers were not willing to end their vested interests and take measures to improve the economy.\n\nHe said extremism was the outcome of using religion for political and strategic purposes and its solution lies in following the vision of Quaid-i-Azam.\n\nHe said South Asia had a tradition of tolerance as compared to Afghanistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 5th, 2023"}, {"url": "https://okc.world/senator-mushahid-hussain-syed/", "page_content": "Hailing from a middle-class background, Mushahid was raised in a progressive and forward looking atmosphere, where quality education and hard work were of central focus.
