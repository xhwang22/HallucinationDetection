Her friend's brother was standing outside of the house with some of his friends, when a dark-colored pickup truck drove by. An unknown male shot into the group of people, hitting Guadalupe and one other person. The male victim survived, having been shot in the leg. Guadalupe died at the scene from a gunshot wound to the head. She was 21 years old.\n\nFrom the evidence left behind, it appears a high-powered rifle was the weapon used to murder Guadalupe. She had no connection to a gang, but the people standing around her did. They are believed to have been the intended targets.\n\nVictim: Carolyn Grant\n\nCase: SAPD 93-310402\n\nOn June 11, 1993, the suspect went to Carolyn Grant's home and knocked on her door. The suspect asked for Carolyn by name, and when she came to the door she was then shot.\n\nVictim: Paul Bernard Quinters\n\nCase: SAPD 93-664789\n\nLocation: 8505 Broadway\n\nOn December 4, 1993, Paul Bernard Quinters was walking with a male friend across the parking lot of Bronco Bill's Night Club located at 8505 Broadway. As they walked across the parking lot, the two suspects were also walking across the parking lot. Paul and his friend got into a verbal confrontation with a Latin male. They got into a physical argument, at which time the suspect pulled out a knife and stabbed Paul multiple times. The suspect got into a vehicle driven by his female companion, and they fled the scene. Paul died on the way to the hospital as a result of his wounds.\n\nThe first suspect is a Latin male, around 5'10\", and 180 pounds. He had black wavy hair, and was possibly in his late thirties at the time of the incident. The second suspect was a Latin female who was also possibly in her late thirties at the time. She had reddish brown shoulder length hair. Their vehicle was a light yellow or gold 1978-1985 Station Wagon, with simulated wood panels on each side.\n\nVictims: Christy Kaufman & Debbie Perkins\n\nCase: SAPD 94-097522\n\nLocation: 100 block of Fredonia Street\n\nOn February 21, 1994, Debbie Perkins and Christy Kaufman were in their home in the 100 block of Fredonia Street. At about 1 a.m., Debbie appears to have allowed someone into the house. The suspect was apparently looking for Debbie's boyfriend who was not home at the time. An argument followed by multiple gunshots was heard by a witness in the back room. Both Debbie and Christy later died of the gunshot wounds they received. The suspect is described as a Black male, with a slender build, and was wearing a white T-shirt and blue jeans. He was driving a blue Cutlass.\n\nVictim: David Garza\n\nCase: SAPD 94-181708\n\nLocation: 3700 block of Broadway\n\nOn April 3, 1994, David Garza and his wife were sitting at a bus stop in the 3700 block of Broadway. As they waited, they were approached by an unknown Hispanic male. After asking David what time the bus should arrive, the suspect stepped behind David and shot him at close range. David stood up and ran a short distance with the suspect still firing shots at him. David collapsed in the parking lot of a nearby Subway restaurant.\n\nThe suspect was described as a Hispanic male, between 5'9\" and 6'0\". He was wearing a dark-colored striped shirt, baggy jeans, and a white or light colored ball cap.\n\nVictim: Olga Acosta\n\nCase: SAPD 94-293660\n\nLocation: Corner of Ted and Pollote Street\n\nOn May 27, 1994, Olga Acosta was inside her home on the corner of Ted and Pollote Street. At around midnight, someone drove by and fired several shots at the house. Olga was hit by one of those shots, and died as a result of the gunshot wound. Several people were at home at the time, but no one else was injured.\n\nThe suspect vehicles were described as a red Toyota pickup, a white Crysler LeBaron, and a red Firebird or Camaro. The suspects were described as Hispanic males. It is believed that street gangs may have been involved in this shooting.\n\nVictims: Sheila Johnson & Steven Munoz\n\nCase: SAPD 94-526950\n\nLocation: 8323 S. Flores\n\nOn September 14, 1994, Sheila Johnson and Steven Munoz were found lying in the parking lot of a car wash at 8323 S. Flores around 3 a.m. Sheila had been shot and was pronounced dead at the scene. Steven had also been shot, and he died after being transported to Wilford Hall Hospital.\n\nVictim: Yugveh Boberg\n\nCase: SAPD 95-024368\n\nLocation: 7678 New Hwy 90 West\n\nOn the afternoon of January 13, 1995, Yugveh Boberg was at work with another employee at the apartment complex located at 7678 New Hwy 90 West. An unknown male wearing a ski mask and armed with a gun came to the office and fired multiple shots. Yugveh suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen and died at the scene from his injuries. He was 58 years old. The other employee also suffered a gunshot wound but survived. The exact motive is unknown, but it could have been related to a series of narcotic arrests made on former tenants at the apartment complex.\n\nVictim: Augustine Sendejo\n\nCase: SAPD 95-1597148\n\nLocation: 1300 block of San Rafael\n\nOn March 21, 1995, Augustine Sendejo was standing on the sidewalk in the 1300 block of San Rafael when the suspect drove by firing a gun and hit Augustine. Augustine fell to the ground and died in the middle of the street. Friends of Augustine had been involved in a run-in with gang members earlier that evening. Gunshots had been exchanged, but no one was hit. There is a possibility that Augustine was mistaken for someone involved in the earlier shooting and was not the intended target.\n\nThe suspect vehicle, which fled the scene east on San Rafael, is described as a late 70s to early 80s dark color Chevy Suburban or Blazer. The vehicle had 4 KC lights on the top, dark tinted windows, large mud tires, and a loud exhaust.\n\nVictim: Virginia Jeffreys\n\nCase: SAPD 95-608770\n\nLocation: 1500 block of Mission Road\n\nOn October 17, 1995, a neighbor went to check on 67-year-old Virginia Jeffreys in her trailer in the 1500 block of Mission Road. They found her dead, and her trailer ransacked. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be blunt trauma and multiple stab wounds. The death was ruled a homicide.\n\nInvestigations found that Virginia's trailer had been burgled on both October 15 and 16, and her body was found the next day. Evidence showed that Virginia was at home on October 15, and probably during the burglary on October 15. Virginia was still alive on October 16, and was murdered on October 16 or 17. There have been several suspects in this case, but investigators are still seeking more information in Virginia\u2019s murder.\n\nVictim: Dorothy Lubbock\n\nCase: SAPD 96-486308\n\nLocation: Roosevelt\n\nIn 1996, Dorothy Lubbock was found stabbed to death in her home on Roosevelt. She was the mother of an SAPD officer and a DPS officer. Three males were seen fleeing the area. The motive for this murder appears to have been robbery.\n\nVictim: Javed Khan\n\nCase: SAPD 96-594801\n\nLocation: 5335 N.W. Loop 410\n\nOn September 29, 1996, Javed Khan was murdered in the parking lot of the Rolling Ridge Square apartments at 5335 N.W. Loop 410 where he lived. The last time anyone spoke to Javed was at 11:30 p.m. and he seemed fine. After parking his car in his assigned spot he was confronted by an unknown person(s) and a confrontation took place. At some point during this encounter Javed was shot. A Wells Fargo security guard later found the body.\n\nVictim: Phillip Hernandez\n\nCase: SAPD 96-623638\n\nLocation: 1900 block of Schley\n\nJust after midnight on October 13, 1996, Phillip Hernandez had returned with his girlfriend from a date at Rivercenter Mall. Phillip and his girlfriend were sitting in his car, a 1987 blue Oldsmobile 4-door, in front of his girlfriend's home in the 1900 block of Schley. Three Hispanic males 15\u201316 years old approached the car, and one of them said \"Is that them?\". One then began punching Phillip through the open window on the driver's side of the car. Another said \"Hey, what are you doing?\", and then all three suspects ran off. Phillip's girlfriend ran inside to get her mother and called 911. She did not notice that Phillip was bleeding until she went back outside to wait for the police and EMS. Phillip was taken to BAMC hospital where he later died from multiple stab wounds.\n\nThe suspects are described as three Hispanic males aged around 15\u201317, who were thin but not skinny. One was wearing a blue or red basketball shirt, one had on a plain white shirt, and one had no shirt at all. They were all described as wearing dark colored jeans. There is no apparent motive for this case.\n\nVictim: Noelle Blaskowski\n\nCase: SAPD 96-753312\n\nLocation: Oakview Motel\n\nOn December 13, 1996, police received a call from the Oakview Motel. Police were met by the manager who said that when he went to the apartment to collect rent money, he found the door open and saw the victim lying on the floor. Officers entered the apartment and found Noelle Blaskowski wearing nothing but a cut-off T-shirt. Her hands were bound behind her. The TV was turned on, and the volume was set at loud. The complainant's vehicle, a 1993 white Nissan Sentra 4-door, was found in the parking lot. Noelle had last been seen the previous day.\n\nNoelle was 24 at the time of her murder, and a dancer at the Wild Zebra Club. The Medical Examiner determined the cause of death to be manual strangulation.\n\nVictim: Gina Tovar\n\nCase: SAPD 97-432716\n\nLocation: Alamo Downs\n\nOn July 18, 1997, a security guard at the Alamo Downs business complex found a U-Haul van parked in the parking lot. Upon closer inspection, he saw a bloody foot sticking out of a pile of clothes on the front floorboard of the van. Police and EMS arrived to find the victim, Gina Tovar, deceased. Gina was a white female who was 28 years old at the time of her death. The cause of death was multiple stab wounds.\n\nIt appears from investigation that the van was parked in the lot at Alamo Downs between 2:20 a.m. and 3 a.m. Gina was last seen in the U-Haul van at the Phillips 66 gas station at Loop 410 and Culebra at around 1 a.m. on July 18. No witnesses have come forward with information, and detectives are asking for the help of citizens to solve this crime. There is fingerprint and DNA evidence which will be useful once they have a suspect. Police have not found a motive for this killing, but suspect drugs could be involved.\n\nVictim: Sabas Arellano\n\nCase: SAPD 98-022171\n\nLocation: 10000 block of Quintana Road\n\nOn January 11, 1998, 22-year-old Sabas Arellano was found dead in the 10000 block of Quintana Road. Sabas had been shot multiple times, and his 1979 gold Pontiac 4-door had been stolen. It is believed that Arellano had been at the Taurino Night Club at Ruiz and Zarzamora earlier. Sabas's wife later found the stolen vehicle at a pharmacy located at Main and San Pedro, near downtown. Sabas was last seen in his vehicle with a young man, and a light-complexioned girl with long hair who was around 19 years old.\n\nVictim: Ailsa \u201cScottie\u201d Heinsohn\n\nCase: SAPD 98-418358\n\nLocation: 3400 Salado Creek\n\nOn July 15, 1998, Ailsa \"Scottie\" Heihsohn, was found stabbed to death in her apartment at 3400 Salado Creek. She was 61 years old.\n\nVictim: Mary Ellen Martinez\n\nCase: SAPD 98-592935\n\nLocation: 2000 Chavaneaux\n\nJust before noon on October 4, 1998, the partially nude body of Mary Ellen Martinez was discovered. Mary was found stabbed to death in the bed of a 1971 brown & green Ford pickup truck that she had borrowed from a friend. The truck was parked in the driveway of 2000 Chavaneaux.\n\nMary was last seen by a friend at 1 a.m. earlier that day, and she was supposed to be going to meet some friends. Mary was 30 years old at the time of her death.\n\nVictim: Lisa Lynn Woods\n\nCase: SAPD 99-124191\n\nLocation: 801 N. San Marcos\n\nOn March 2, 1999, a patrol officer noticed two men running from a vacant field in front of an abandoned fire station located at 801 N. San Marcos. The officer stopped the two men, who then said that they saw a dead person lying in the vacant lot. The two men were questioned and released, and did not appear to have any connection to the case. The officer then found the body of Lisa Lynn Woods. It was obvious that Lisa was murdered elsewhere and then dumped at this location.\n\nThe autopsy by Dr. Dana showed that Lisa died from a gunshot wound to the head, and the manner of death was ruled a homicide. Lisa was a white female, and was 38 years old at the time of her death.\n\nVictim: Shelle McGugin\n\nCase: SAPD 99-329848\n\nLocation: 2554 Loop 410 NE\n\nOn June 2, 1999, the decomposed body of a woman was found in a unit of the Sunflower Apartments at 2554 Loop 410 NE. The woman was later identified by the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office as Shelle McGugin. Shelle had been strangled with an electrical cord, and was 35 years old at the time of her death.\n\nVictim: Daniel Galloway\n\nCase: SAPD 99-609444\n\nLocation: IH 35 between Pine Street and New Braunfels\n\nOn October 5, 1999, Daniel Galloway was with his friend in a red Ford pickup truck. They had just left the Sutton Homes housing project, and were on IH 35 between Pine Street and New Braunfels when a car with three to four Black males pulled up alongside them. The suspect vehicle was described as a gray midsized fastback-style 2-door car. Daniel \"flipped\" them off, and shots came from the suspect vehicle. Daniel was shot, and the driver went to NE Baptist Hospital where Galloway was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound.\n\nOver the years there have been several names of suspects put forward, but there has not been enough evidence to file charges on the killer of Daniel. From the original investigation and from the calls that did come in we know that there are citizens out there who can help solve this case."}], "Rudy Fernandez's parents were Mexican immigrants.": [{"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-08-26/four-generations-mexico-to-u-s-a-culture-odyssey", "page_content": "Arcadio Yniguez was barely a teenager when he crossed the border into the United States in 1913. He came from Nochistlan, a town in central Mexico; like thousands of his countrymen, he was fleeing the violence of the Mexican revolution. Family legend later said that he had run horse for Pancho Villa at age 12 and even shared meals with the notorious revolutionary.\n\nAs Arcadio made his way north, he worked at odd jobs, tending cattle for a time at the huge King Ranch in Texas. H ended up in Chicago, where he met and married Guadalupe Salazar, another young immigrant from Mexico.\n\nTheir marriage lasted only a few years. Arcadio eventually returned to Nochistlan; Guadalupe caught a train to Los Angeles and took their only child with her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom those modest beginnings came a remarkable family. Guadalupe, a strong-willed and resourceful woman, became the leader. Arcadio, despite his absence, remained a respected patriarch.\n\nOver four generations, the family\u2019s experiences have mirrored the history of Mexicans and their descendants in California. The people of this family have seen Mexican immigrants like themselves forcibly \u201crepatriated,\u201d their children punished for speaking Spanish and their sons sent off to war while anti-Mexican mobs rampaged through Los Angeles. But they have also helped organize a union for farm workers and joined in a Chicano political movement for equal opportunities.\n\nAnd now, as Latinos have grown to one-fourth of the city\u2019s population, most of the younger family members have moved from Los Angeles\u2019 segregated barrios to the suburbs that their parents were not allowed to enter.\n\nToday, the family is as diverse as the community it represents. In its ranks are high school drop outs, blue-collar workers and professionals. Most call themselves Mexican-Americans or Mexicanos; others prefer the term Chicanos or Latinos.\n\nArcadio has been dead eight years, but Guadalupe, 79, confined to a wheelchair by a stroke, remains the influential matriarch still intent on keeping the family together. It has not been easy.\n\nLike other Mexican-Americans, Guadalupe\u2019s descendants are caught between two opposing forces\u2014the pressure to assimilate and the pull of ethnic identity and kinship with other Latinos. More than most ethnic groups, Mexican-Americans have managed to hang onto their culture while struggling for acceptance within the larger society.\n\nBut the pull-and-tug never ends: Guadalupe, who has learned English, stubbornly insists on speaking Spanish to her grandchildren, though few of them understand her.\n\nIn 1976, senior citizen clubs on the Eastside gave their \u201cMother of the Year\u201d award to Guadalupe\u2014mother of 6, grandmother of 28, great-grandmother of 10, respected elder of an extended family totaling more than 200.\n\nIn 1981, more than half a century after her arrival in the country, she became a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn many respects, Guadalupe and her family are the traditional American immigrant story. But there is a Mexican twist: With each new wave in the continuous immigration from Mexico, the story begins again.\n\nGuadalupe sees recently arrived relatives from Mexico, retracing her family\u2019s steps as they begin a new life in this country.\n\nMexicans, whose ancestors inhabited the Southwest long before the region became part of the United States, have strong feelings about this land. The Mexican immigrant does not have to cross an ocean. Only a line on the map separates two regions that once were one and that remain connected by longstanding familial, historical and cultural ties.\n\nThus, the journey of Guadalupe is as meaning today as it was 52 years ago when she and her 5-year-old son, Rudy, boarded a train bound for Los Angeles and an uncertain future\n\n::\n\nWatching open fields and cities race past her train window in 1931, Guadalupe wondered what it would be like to see her father again after more than 20 years.\n\nHer last childhood memory of him was still etched in her mind: his hands tied behind his back. Being led away by federal soldiers to be pressed into military service during the Mexican revolution.\n\nA few years later, her father joined the stream of Mexicans escaping the turmoil in their country and found his way to Los Angeles.\n\nHis countrymen\u2019s cheap labor was welcomed in the fields and in the city. Mexicans laid rails across the Southwest and worked in massive construction projects in Southern California.\n\nBut they profited little from the development boom.\n\nHousing was so overcrowded that some Mexicans lived in tent and shack colonies in central Los Angeles. They weren\u2019t allowed to swim at some public beaches and were turned away from restaurants and schools.\n\nBy 1930, nearly 100,000 Mexicans lived in this rapidly developing city of 1.2 million. Six Spanish-language newspapers were published, but no political structure of any importance developed. Mexican government envoys stationed in Los Angeles were the most respected figures, and they kept community attention focused on the homeland.\n\nGuadalupe\u2019s first memory of Los Angeles is the palm trees. And she remembers being pleasantly surprised by the multitude of brown faces.\n\nShe went to work at a cannery, remarried and became active in the church and neighborhood social clubs. On weekends she and her family mingled with other Mexican immigrants at the downtown Olvera Street Plaza, a cultural and social center since the late 1700s, when Los Angeles was settled by Spain, before the city became part of Mexico.\n\nAnd she was reunited with her father, Miguel Salazar. He had remarried and was living on the Eastside, earning $10 a week as a baker. With the money that he and his wife and 13 children earned each summer by picking fruit up and down the state, the family later was able to open a bakery on 1st Street.\n\nHer father also was a strong union man. He participated in bakers union marches, part of an early burst of activity by unions with large Mexican-American memberships, from the fields to the garment factories.\n\nGuadalupe and her second husband, Tiburcio Rivera, settled in East Los Angeles, near her father\u2019s home, in an area still known as El Hoyo (The Hole). Tiburcio had been a band musician in Mexica and a pool-hall owner in Chicago, where he and Guadalupe met.\n\nThey began a family of their own (they raised five children, her son and their four daughters), and Tiburcio found work in an asbestos factory. One daughter remembers his returning home at the end of each day covered in white dust.\n\n(The dust meant nothing to them at the time. But after 13 years in a sanitarium, Tiburcio died of tuberculosis, and the family later recalled that at least five of Tiburcio\u2019s Mexican co-workers had died of the same disease.)\n\nWhen the Great Depression came, Tiburcio lost his and Guadalupe made the rounds of churches in the neighborhood, begging for milk for her children. She worked as a house cook and was allowed to take some food home. She made clothes for the children out of empty sugar and flour sacks.\n\nAs the economy worsened, the unemployment rate among Mexicans exceeded that of the general population. But Mexicans found themselves accused of taking jobs for from American citizens. The U.S. government launched the Mexican repatriation movement, an event that Guadalupe remembers with distaste.\n\nThousands of Mexicans were loaded onto trains\u2014the same trains many of them had helped build\u2014and sent back to Mexico. Although exact records were not kept, scholars estimate that one of every three Mexicans living in the United States was deported\u2014an estimated 500,000, many of them U.S. citizens.\n\n\u201cIt was a terrible thing to see friends being moved out,\u201d Guadalupe recalled. \u201cMany people were forced to leave their homes and their belongings behind. It was sad. Some simply left notes with friends that they had to leave.\u201d\n\nGuadalupe\u2019s countrymen did not protest. Nor did anyone else.\n\n(Two decades later, Guadalupe saw a new generation of Mexican immigrants rounded up and sent back to Mexico during \u201cOperation Wetback.\u201d Border patrol agents roused families in their homes and tracked down others at schools and other public places. During a five-year period ending in 1955, an estimated 3.8 million deportations were recorded.\n\n(In the 1960s, however, a new generation of Mexican-Americans began loudly protesting the government\u2019s immigration and deportation policies. Today, many are protesting the Simpson-Mazzoli bills, seeping immigration legislation that many fear will again result in massive deportations and discrimination against Latinos.)\n\n::\n\nGuadalupe\u2019s children remember growing up in a friendly community where paisanos (compatriots) gathered on weekends in backyards to share food and the latest gossip.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like everybody we knew was a paisano. It felt like we were living in Mexico,\u201d Guadalupe\u2019s daughter, Ofelia, said. Years later, when she visited Mexico the first time, Ofelia already knew the names of flowers and trees, the smells and feel of Mexico, from stories her mother had told her.\n\nThe focus of young Ofelia\u2019s world was the local Catholic and nearby mortuary on Brooklyn Avenue. \u201cThe big events in our neighborhood were weddings and funerals. Everybody took part,\u201d she recalled.\n\nEven then, East Los Angeles was a city within a city. Residents shopped at local stores and went outside the area only to work. \u201cI had no concept of what existed beyond East Los Angeles,\u201d Ofelia said.\n\nOfelia\u2019s first contact with Anglos \u2014 anyone other than Mexicans \u2014 was at school. \u201cSchool was a very separate life. It was us against them,\u201d she recalled.\n\nMexican-American children were given demerits and kept after school for speaking Spanish. It was an experience that many remembered when they began raising families of their own. Ofelia\u2019s generation, reprimanded at home for speaking English and punished at school for speaking Spanish, was determined to spare their children such anguish, and Spanish began to fade from their homes.\n\nThere were other discrepancies between the two worlds that, as a child, Ofelia could not reconcile: Why, at the lunch break, did Mexican children hide their homemade tacos and burritos under the table? Or why did an Anglo woman in the neighborhood call her a \u201cdirty Mexican\u201d when, in fact, Ofelia\u2019s mother was a stickler for cleanliness?\n\nBut there were also friends to be made. Over a small hill behind Ofelia\u2019s home lived the Esparza family and their 10 children. Ofelia used to get into rock fights with some of them. But when she asked the oldest, Amado, to the junior high school Sadie Hawkins dance, it was the beginning of a lifelong romance.\n\nAmado and Ofelia, like other children in the neighborhood, attended Hammel Street Elementary, Belvedere Junior High and Garfield High schools.\n\nJunior high was a \u201cbig new world\u201d where Ofelia, always a bright student, remembers feeling insecure about competing with her Anglo classmates. She sensed that Mexican students were being treated unfairly. Pachuco-style short black skirts and pompadour hairdos popular among Mexican girls were ruled to be in violation of the school dress code. Ofelia and many of her friends became openly defiant.\n\nOfelia\u2019s brother, Rudy Estrada Jr., also has vivid memories of that period. He had come to Los Angeles on the train with his mother in 1931, the only child of Guadalupe and Arcadio, who had used the name Rodolfo Estrada for an unexplained reason when they married. Shoeshine boy, errand boy and later slaughterhouse worker, he became the family\u2019s main source of support when Guadalupe\u2019s second husband was stricken with tuberculosis.\n\nGuadalupe Aviles and son Rudy Estrada Jr. (Handout)\n\nRemembering his child\u2019s view of what lay ahead, Rudy said it never occurred to him to be a mailman or a white-collar worker.\n\n\u201cI thought those jobs are only for white people. If you\u2019re Mexican, someday maybe you become a bricklayer or a janitor or something like that .... Or maybe a fighter. Yeah that was the escape. I knew a lot of them.\u201d\n\nSports, in fact, became a tradition among the young males in Guadalupe\u2019s family, and among the grandchildren there were several Garfield High School football stars.\n\nWhen Rudy was growing up, the chief entertainment was partying with friends at someone\u2019s home or going to the nearby swimming hole. Most other places were off limits to Mexicans, he recalled.\n\nAt the theaters, Mexicans and blacks were ushered upstairs or made to sit in the back. And at a public plunge, which Rudy visited only once, they were allowed in only on Wednesdays. On Thursdays, the water was changed.\n\nRudy\u2019s brother-in-law, Amado Esparza, recalled driving with his teen-age friends east on Whittier Boulevard, \u201cjust to see how far we could go.\u201d\n\nIn nearby Montebello, a predominantly white community at the time, police stopped them.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d tell us, \u2018You don\u2019t belong here,\u2019 and send us back to East L.A.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe lived in a glass bubble,\u201d he said.\n\nWorld War II would burst it.\n\n::\n\nIn the country\u2019s scramble to gear up for war, everyone\u2019s labor was required, including that of Mexican-Americans. Even workers from Mexico who earlier had been the targets of massive deportations were once again welcomed. But there was a price to be paid.\n\nMexican-Americans died at a higher rate than any other group during World War II. And at home, anti-Mexican sentiment exploded into race riots in East Los Angeles during the summer of 1943, as sailors invaded the community to tangle with local youths in what came to be known as the \u201cZoot Suit Riots.\u201d\n\nGuadalupe, like other concerned parents, tried to keep her son, Rudy, off the streets. And she did not want him wearing the baggy pegged pants that the youths called \u201cdrapes\u201d and the loose shirts and pointed shoes that characterized the pachuco style popular among young Mexican-Americans.\n\nBut Rudy saw the carloads of American servicemen who wheeled into East Los Angeles looking for the pachucos they called \u201czoot-suiters.\u201d He was amazed at the viciousness of their attacks.\n\n\u201cAt Jesusita\u2019s (a neighbor), they pulled out her husband and one of the young kids\u2014pulled them right out of their home\u2014and beat the hell out of them,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd two of her sons were already fighting overseas . . . .\u201d\n\nRudy recalled with some pride that Mexican-American gangs put their rivalries aside to join forces against the soldiers and sailors.\n\n\u201cWhen the gangs finally got together one day, boy, they kicked some ass,\u201d he said, recalling one encounter where \u201cthere must have been 1,000 cars . . . . They had ropes and we had chains and jacks . . . .\u201d\n\nThe 16-year-old boy did not understand what the fights were about, but years later Rudy concluded that \u201cthey were just racist . . . .Everywhere we went it was always, \u2018Let\u2019s get the Mexicans\u2019 . . . . And the police just turned their back.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t after just guys wearing zoot suits. They were after Mexicans. The newspapers substituted the name Mexican for zoot suits.\n\n\u201cSome of the same guys that were in those riots came home with Distinguished Service Crosses, Silver Stars, Bronze Stars and Purple Hearts that you could fill a bus with . . . .That\u2019s what was so unreal, that\u2019s what used to bug me. . . .If they treat me like that, what the hell am I doing here (fighting in the war)?\u201d\n\nRudy Estrada Jr. during the Korean War. (Handout )\n\nRudy fought hard.\n\nHe was in four campaigns, including the Battle of the Bulge, where he was wounded in the right shoulder. He saw European cities in ruin and the grim remnants of Nazi atrocities at concentration camps.\n\nRudy earned a Purple Heart and Bronze and Silver stars. His father would probably have taken him out for a beer to celebrate.\n\nRudy had last seen Arcadio Yniguez in 1944, just after joining the service at 17. The family patriarch arrived unexpectedly in Los Angeles to talk to his son.\n\n\u201cHe said that if I didn\u2019t want to go in the Army, I could go to Mexico with him.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018I don\u2019t owe Mexico a damned thing. Everything I have and hope to be is in this country.\u2019\n\n\u201cI think he was kind of proud of that answer. Then we went and had a beer.\u201d\n\nThe military was a strong family tradition. Favorite family characters include Gen. Jose Ines Salazar, a colorful rebel leader who is said to have fought on various sides during the Mexican revolution, and a great-aunt, another revolutionary, said to have ridden a horse better than any man.\n\nYears later, Vietnam tore at that tradition. But World War II was a landmark in Rudy\u2019s life and the lives of an entire generation of Mexican-Americans, even with the pain brought many.\n\nRudy recalled a time when he and some Army buddies, traveling east with their outfit, were refused service at a San Antonio restaurant because they were \u201cMexican.\u201d\n\nHurt and angry, he demanded of the waiter: \u201cDoes this look like a Mexican uniform?\u201d But it didn\u2019t help.\n\n\u201cThen we got to Mississippi and we found out that blacks couldn\u2019t even walk on the sidewalk. We discovered just how bad it was.\u201d\n\nBack in East Los Angeles, one of Rudy\u2019s aunts remembers the anxious walk home from work each day when she would glance at the banners on neighborhood windows, each indicating with a colored star whether a solider in the family had been wounded or killed.\n\n\u201cIt was very sad because you knew all the families in the community and you knew who had died,\u201d she said.\n\nBut there were good times too, and the walls that had separated Mexican-Americans from the outside world began to crumble.\n\nEven Mexican-American women found well-paying jobs open to them in the shipyards and other defense plants.\n\nYoung couples ventured outside the barrio for the first time to socialize at the Cocoanut Grove and other popular ballrooms, where they danced to the big band sounds of Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller.\n\nBy the time the war ended, more than 300,000 Mexican-Americans had served in the armed forces. They became the country\u2019s most decorated ethnic group.\n\nThey would no longer accept the old insult that Mexicans had heard for generations: \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it here, go back to Mexico.\u201d\n\nThey were Americans. They were not going back to Mexico, nor would they be confined to the isolated barrios where they had grown up.\n\n\u201cWorld War II opened up a lot of people\u2019s eyes. We learned a lot,\u201d Rudy said.\n\nBut if they had changed, often they found that things around them had not.\n\nRudy married his childhood sweetheart, and the couple set out to but a home with a GI loan, in Pico Rivera at a new housing development where he was a construction worker.\n\nBut a salesman told them that it was a \u201crestricted\u201d neighborhood.\n\n\u201cthey didn\u2019t want Mexicans in there and I was building the damned houses!\u201d Rudy recalled. He chuckled at the memory, noting that Pico Rivera \u201cis now all Mexican.\u201d\n\nBut that day, Rudy was furious. He kept thinking about the war and what he and his Chicano friends had been through and about his two buddies who did not come back.\n\n\u201cit was racism. And it really hurt,\u201d said Rudy, whose remarkably expressive dark eyes reflect a mixture of tenderness and toughness developed over years of battling open attacks on his dignity.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here,\u201d Rudy\u2019s young bride told him that day. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want me here, I don\u2019t want to buy a house in this lousy place.\u201d\n\nMany Mexican-American veterans shared Rudy\u2019s outrage. Through organizations like the Community Service Organizations, the American GI Forum and the League of United Latin American Citizens, they began challenging restrictive housing covenants and other forms of discrimination.\n\nLeaders like Rep. Edward Roybal (D-Los Angeles), who was elected to the Los Angeles City Council in 1949, merged from this World War II generation. Guadalupe was among those who walked door to door during his campaign.\n\nA generation of Mexican-Americans began their move into the middle class, as higher-paying occupations began opening up to them. With the help of GI benefits, some entered college.\n\n\u201cWhen the war was over, we all got jobs, started going to school and buying homes,\u201d Rudy recalled. \u201cPeople got married and moved away to places like Montebello, West Covina, La Puente, Hacienda Heights, Alhambra. They built swimming pools and bought nice cars.\u201d\n\nBut East Los Angeles was still home for many. Rudy and his young bride brought their first house there and raised four children. Rudy\u2019s sister, Ofelia, and her childhood sweetheart, Amado, also remained.\n\nAmado had joined the Army in 1947 when he was 16 and blossomed into a fine athlete. He toured Hawaii for two years as a light-heavyweight boxing champion and missed a chance to try out for the Olympics because of a dislocated jaw.\n\nHe returned to the old neighborhood a star and took Ofelia to her high school prom.\n\nOfelia, who wanted to be a teacher, enrolled at East Los Angeles College. But, worried that she would be come a financial strain on her family, she quit and went to work at a downtown sewing factory. The job paid less than $1 an hour.\n\nAmado and Ofelia married in 1951. As the first of nine children began arriving, Amado forgot about sports and his ambition to become a policeman. He supported his family on $50 a week earned as a rubbish collector. Later, he worked at a cloth mill and drove trucks. Sometimes he could not find work.\n\nOfelia and her sisters remember the 1950s as the decade they spent being mothers and wives. Most moved from East Los Angeles, but Ofelia stayed.\n\n\u201cOfelia always wanted to stay in the community and help somehow,\u201d Amado recalled.\n\nAt work, Amado was frequently asked by Anglo co-workers, \u201cHow can you live there?\u201d\n\nHe grew tired of the offensive innuendo.\n\nFor Amado and Ofelia\u2019s children, the little cracker-box house on the hill with a large backyard offered a sheltered environment. There were trees and giant maguey plants as well as a maze of prickly pear cactus that formed natural caves. In the children\u2019s minds, the caves became castles and hidden passages where monsters and brave warriors fought to the death.\n\nYears later, their son, Ben Esparza, credited his childhood experiences with developing his imagination and helping him in his work with physically handicapped children, as director of a special education clinic at California State University, Los Angeles.\n\nThere was another advantage, he said: \u201cI never questioned my ethnic identity.\u201d\n\nFor some youngsters, life in postwar East Los Angeles was troublesome. One of Rudy\u2019s young brothers-in-law began hanging around neighborhood toughs from the El Hoyo gang and created such problems for his mother that she turned him over to Rudy to straighten out. Rudy was the one whom family members most often turned with disciplinary problems. Despite his intervention, some young nephews became involved with drugs and alcohol and dropped out of school.\n\nOther youngsters venturing outside the barrio for the first time often found the experience unsettling. It happened to Rudy\u2019s son, William, when the family moved to Whittier in 1970.\n\nWhittier was a predominantly Anglo suburb at the time, and William remembers his brief time at a high school there as lonely and confusing. Uneasy around Anglos and \u201cAnglicized\u201d Chicanos, William opted to return to the same segregated but nurturing environment where his parents had grown up.\n\nHe moved back to East Los Angeles to live with his grandmother and attend Garfield High School.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand to be away. White people had always been foreign to me,\u201d he said.\n\nYears later, William marveled at the difference between him and a younger brother, who grew up in the suburbs.\n\n\u201cI can relate to his music and his surfing. . . . But in some ways he can\u2019t get into me. He can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like cruising the boulevard, jumping fences or running through a cemetery at night with your friends.\u201d\n\nBut if William has trouble relating to his brother in the Anglo suburbs, so doe a young cousin from Mexico have trouble relating to William and his family.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very Chicano . . . Americanized. We\u2019re Mexicano,\u201d said the cousin, Leticia Yniguez. \u201cWe don\u2019t get excited about Fourth of July picnics. We\u2019re not the hot dog-hamburger type of family. Our idea of a celebration is a wedding.\u201d\n\nThis diversity within one family also illustrates how the cycle of immigration continues in East Los Angeles.\n\nLeticia, 26, is the eldest daughter of Samuel Yniguez. Samuel is one of three sons raised by the family patriarch, Arcadio, after Arcadio\u2019s return to Mexico four decades ago.\n\nSamuel and his family moved to East Los Angeles in 1960 after a small grocery store business in Mexico failed. He has worked as a tailor ever since.\n\nI was Samuel\u2019s wife, Socorro, who encouraged her husband to make the move.\n\n\u201cI had one dream since we got married. That was buying our own home. I didn\u2019t see much chance of realizing it in Mexico,\u201d she said. Eighteen years after their arrival, they purchased a home.\n\n\u201cMy brothers had come to work here. We had relatives and friends who had come. So I told my husband: \u2018How is it that everybody risks going, even when they don\u2019t have (immigration) papers. And you, who have them, aren\u2019t willing?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Yniguezes and other recent immigrants like them continuously renew the Mexican flavor of East Los Angeles, as they replace those who move to the suburbs. It is a process that perpetuates the barrio\u2019s isolation.\n\n::\n\nWhile the Yniguezes were getting settled in East Los Angeles, a new political mood was developing among the more established members of the Mexican-American community. For the first time, they were becoming involved in large numbers in a presidential election.\n\nLike many Mexican-Americans Guadalupe\u2019s son, Rudy, was an ardent admirer of John F. Kennedy. Viva Kennedy clubs had sprung up in Mexican-American communities across the Southwest to work for his election in 1960.\n\nRudy also understood the anger and frustration of the black civil rights movement.\n\n\u201cI think the black, like the Chicano, has been abused for too long. Poverty has had a lot to do with it . . . no jobs, no food. I was sympathetic with their cause. Not the burning and looting. But it was time they made some noise,\u201d he said.\n\nMexican farm workers also were making themselves heard. Led by Cesar Chavez, they began organizing in rural California, staging boycotts and strikes for better pay and decent work conditions.\n\nAmong the families working the fields of the San Joaquin Valley were the De La Rosas.\n\nSome of the family\u2019s ancestors came from Nochistlan, the same Mexican town that was home to Rudy\u2019s father, the patriarch Arcadio. The parallel tracks of these two families\u2014one rural, the other urban\u2014crossed again in Los Angeles.\n\nOld men in Nochistlan, Mexico, where thousands traveled back and forth to the United States. (Jose Galvez / Los Angeles Times)\n\nRudy\u2019s son, William, met Patricia De La Rosa while attending California State University, Los Angeles. Later, they married.\n\nPatricia came from a family with deep roots in the farm workers movement. Especially her aunt Margaret.\n\nMargaret married a bracero whom she met on the migrant trail when she was 18. He was one of thousands of temporary workers allowed into the country when the United States was at war and in need of farm laborers.\n\nMargaret said her husband, Juan Govea, who had studied music at universities in Mexico, was a man with \u201cliberated ideas.\u201d\n\nWhile working at railroad camps as a bracero, Juan spoke out on behalf of his fellow workers. During the late 1940s, after the couple settled in Bakersfield, Juan helped organize a chapter of the Community Service Organization. The group, based on the community-organizing ideas of Saul Alinsky, was viewed as a threat by the white community. Margaret recalled being labeled a \u201ccommunist.\u201d\n\nAnd Juan Govea befriended the young Cesar Chavez, also a community service organizer. Chavez, who in time effected fundamental changes in California agriculture, made a strong impression on the family.\n\nThe Govea\u2019s eldest daughter, Jessica, quit college in 1967 to devote herself full time to Chavez\u2019s union effort. One of her first assignments was to travel to Canada to drum up support for the union\u2019s grape boycott, called in an effort to pressure growers into signing union contracts.\n\n\u201cIt was a total commitment of yourself,\u201d she recalled. \u201cAnd it was faith. The (union) effort was something so strong and so right that it had to happen. Changes had to be brought about.\u201d\n\nJessica later served on the union\u2019s board of directors. She left the organization about a year ago, and she took some lessons with her: \u201cI learned about the obligation to share what I have with people and how to bring about social change.\u201d\n\nChavez\u2019s movement so inspired Mexican-Americans in the city that they began mobilizing. They, too, were angry at an economic system that had historically welcomed Mexican labor but refused to pay adequate compensation for it.\n\nThey demonstrated and marched for better schools and higher college enrollment. They joined the growing protests against the Vietnam War, in which Mexican-Americans were again dying in disproportionately high numbers.\n\nA new generation of Mexican-Americans wrestled with the issue of ethnic identity and took it a step further, meshing it with a political identity as Chicanos.\n\nGuadalupe\u2019s children and grandchildren would be swept up by the times.\n\n::\n\nFor Ofelia, who began working as a teacher\u2019s aide and attending neighborhood meetings, the Chicano movement marked a turning point from housewife and mother to community activist. She also began developing as an artist. Her paintings were later shown at community exhibits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like she\u2019d been holding her breath for 15 years and then came up for air and took a deep, deep breath,\u201d her son, Ben, said.\n\n\u201cI started listening to people who were raising their voices,\u201d Ofelia said. \u201cI saw a great need for change and I had to join them.\u201d\n\nAs a teacher\u2019s aide, Ofelia was irked by the lack of support from administrators and teachers for bilingual education programs. Remembering what it was like as a child to be forbidden to speak her mother tongue, she became determined to help a new generation of immigrant children avoid the same conflict.\n\nShe dusted off her old dream and went back to school to become a bilingual teacher, dividing her time between community activities, her home, her job and her studies.\n\nAs her world broadened, Ofelia found that the racist attitudes her generation had fought to dispel were still current.\n\n\u201cPeople developed the impression that if you speak Spanish, are dark and poor, you\u2019re not very intelligent,\u201d said Ofelia, who grew up fighting that definition herself. \u201cI believe we have a right to achieve to our fullest and still keep our Mexicanness . . . .I have a right to speak my language and dress as I will. I have contributed to make this country what it is. My family and my ancestors have contributed.\u201d\n\nAnd there was Vietnam. Like a previous war, it left a mark on the family.\n\nOne of the first to go was the young son of Guadalupe and her third husband, Alberto Aviles. The boy, Albert Jr., was eager to match the example of his older brother, Rudy, whose wartime exploits were still admired.\n\nAt 18, Albert enlisted in the Marine Corps. He quickly became a corporal.\n\n\u201cI felt pride being Chicano and in knowing that across our family\u2019s generations, we\u2019ve been warriors. And I believed what they said, that I was going there to protect my country against communism,\u201d he said.\n\nBut what Albert saw when he got to Vietnam filled him with doubt. \u201cThere was no sense of purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like the ugly American.\u201d\n\nIn 1967, about a year after he left, Albert returned from Vietnam with a bullet wound through his head.\n\nAfter he recovered, Albert went with his father to Mexico to fulfill a manda, a religious promise that his father had made in hope that his sone would come back from the war alive.\n\nThey went to the cathedral in San Juan de los Lagos, which attracts religious pilgrims from throughout Mexico. At the entrance of the large church, Albert\u2019s father got on his knees and hobbled the entire distance to the altar. Albert watched from the side.\n\nLooking back on that difficult period, Albert credited his family\u2019s love and concern for getting him through.\n\nAlbert became an advocate for Vietnam War veterans and later noted that nearly 90% of the Mexican-American veterans he met had been combat soldiers. He came to see the war in Vietnam as \u201ca systematic way of dealing with us . . . . If you were Mexican-American, you were going to end up in a combat unit, because you probably didn\u2019t have an education . . . .It was like a systematic genocide.\u201d\n\nAlbert said he still has nightmares and cries about \u201cthe things that happened\u201d in Vietnam. Now, when he hears the latest news from Central America, he gets angry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019ll let my nephews fight for nothing. I\u2019ll march in the streets,\u201d he said. \u201cI stayed quiet last time. I\u2019m not going to do it again.\u201d\n\nOthers in the family were similarly affected by Vietnam.\n\nRudy, the veteran of World War II and Korea, tried to enlist for Vietnam when his younger brother, his eldest son, a brother-in-law and several cousins joined or were drafted.\n\nBut as the war dragged on, and other, younger members of the family joined the mass protests against it, Rudy\u2019s views changed. He sided with his son, William, when William decided to avoid the draft.\n\nOver the years, the family\u2019s \u201cwarrior\u201d tradition found a new expression. College diplomas and athletic awards began to replace the standard photo gallery of men in uniform on some family walls.\n\n::\n\nIn the late summer of 1970, more than 20,000 people participated in an anti-war march in East Los Angeles. A riot later erupted after law enforcement officers moved in to disperse the crowd that had assembled at a local park.\n\nAmong the crowd were several family members, including Guadalupe, who had taken Rudy\u2019s children to the park to listen to the music and speakers.\n\nThey arrived home safely, but three men died and hundreds of others were injured.\n\nAmong the dead was Ruben Salazar, a journalist who had earned the respect of the community through his columns about Chicanos in The Times. He was killed when a tear gas projectile, fired into a local bar by sheriff\u2019s deputies, struck him in the head. An investigation concluded without criminal charges being filed.\n\nBut Rudy remains convinced that \u201cthe whole thing was planned.\u201d\n\nRudy\u2019s son, William, like many of his cousins, was in junior high school when the period opened. Many of these young Chicanos came to feel that the movement had passed them by. But it proved to be a political awakening, nonetheless.\n\nWilliam remembers it as a times when Mexican-Americans reassessed their belief in America\u2019s promise:\n\n\u201cMy parents began sizing up their duty to the country, their hard work and what the returns had been . . . .\n\n\u201cThey remembered the zoot suit riots. . . . They saw police coming into our neighborhood . . . . Then there was the Salazar murder. They were trying to figure out what was going on.\u201d\n\nWilliam\u2019s cousin, Ben, became involved in a Marxist-Leninist Chicano group while attending Cal State Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of mixed emotions about what I was. Culturally, I was sure of my identity as a Chicano, Mexicano and as an American, because I was born here,\u201d Ben said. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t identify with a society that spits on my own people.\u201d\n\nBen left the group as internal turmoil began splitting it apart. Years later, he concluded that his identity was more deeply rooted in a strong sense of family than in any particular political ideology.\n\nFor Samuel Yniguez\u2019s eldest, Leticia, the question of identity posed a different problem. She had strong ties to Mexico, and they were reinforced by family trips to Nochistlan. There, her grandfather, the patriarch Arcadio, \u201cinstilled pride in us,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told us we could do anything and that nothing could stop us.\u201d\n\nLeticia recalled that \u201cfor a while, I wanted to be Chicana.\u201d She found it difficult, however, to identify with second- and third-generation Chicanos, such as her cousins, who tried to show their cultural pride by wearing ponchos and huaraches.\n\nNor could Leticia accept the second-class status of Latinos in the United States as her own. Thus, she was unable to identify with a political movement fighting to improve it.\n\nBut she recalled being intrigued with the concept of Aztlan that was presented in college Chicano studies courses. Aztlan, the mythical homeland of the Aztecs, became a symbol of a Chicano Southwest.\n\nIt was appealing because Leticia, like many of her relatives, sees the Southwest and Mexico as one.\n\n\u201cThere is no border,\u201d said Leticia, who watches relatives come and go between the two countries at will. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really exist.\u201d\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the marches and demonstrations had ceased.\n\nGiving up the streets for what many called \u201ca more sophisticated\u201d approach, Chicanos began forming professional associations and became active in civil rights and grass-roots neighborhood organizations.\n\nMany of the old leaders became lawyers, college professors and bureaucrats. They received government appointments and a few were even elected to office.\n\nBut for the majority of Mexican-Americans, things remained pretty much the same.\n\nWhen Guadalupe looks back on her life and considers where Chicanos are today, she is somewhat pleased.\n\n\u201cWe have a little more power and more representation. They can\u2019t ignore us anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she is concerned that Mexican-Americans are losing touch with their culture. Her solution is family unity. \u201cYou have to have family unity,\u201d she said.\n\nSome of her grandchildren contend that the racism the family has battled for generations is still holding them and their community back.\n\nSeveral are attending college and a few have entered professional fields, but most have not. For every teacher in the family, there are many high school dropouts and blue-collar workers.\n\nSome are struggling in these recessionary times. Ofelia\u2019s husband, Amado, has been out of work for nearly year. And he knows that he is not alone. Last year, the unemployment rate among Mexican-Americans in California was 15.3%, compared to 9.9% overall.\n\nAmado, 52, spends his days puttering in his workshop, isolated by a wall of silence from his wife and their children. \u201cI feel so damned useless,\u201d he said.\n\nAmado also feels betrayed after working 23 years for a trucking company that went out of business and left him without a job or pension. \u201cYou work all those years to get ahead and suddenly, you\u2019re threatened with losing it all. . . .It shouldn\u2019t be like that,\u201d he said.\n\nOfelia, an ageless, dark-eyed beauty with high cheekbones of her Indian ancestors, has stayed close to her roots and become the keeper of the family\u2019s history and cultural heritage. She is credited by a younger with helping them develop a sense of identity as Chicanos and as part of a community.\n\nOfelia worried that her participation in Chicano Movement activities could cost her a job. But in 1975, after becoming the family\u2019s first college graduate when she was 43, Ofelia began teaching at City Terrace Elementary School, where she remains. Two of her sisters, one a teacher now, the other a foundry worker, also returned to college in their 40s, while working and still raising their youngest children.\n\nRudy, 57, remains a respected member of the family. His memories of unpleasant confrontations with racism are tempered with many good remembrances. He is not a bitter man. He remains optimistic and still buys into the American dream. He lives in West Covina and has a wide multiracial circle of friends. An avid sportsman, he looks forward to retiring and moving with his wife to the mountains.\n\nGuadalupe\u2019s family is as diverse culturally and politically as it is economically.\n\nAnd although many point to this as a sign of progress, there is concern that it may be straining the family\u2019s cohesiveness and that of the community it reflects.\n\nMost of Guadalupe\u2019s grandchildren no longer speak Spanish and some have abandoned their parents\u2019 religion for more contemporary ones.\n\n\u201cImagine, they don\u2019t pray to La Virgen de Guadalupe anymore,\u201d she said.\n\nSome are growing up in mixed neighborhoods like Alhambra, where, to the amazement of those raised in the barrio, they are listening to new-wave music, dating Anglos and drifting away from the community and their culture. But some of their Mexicano cousins, like Leticia, remain close to the culture and others are returning to it.\n\nTheir elders complain that \u201cthe younger generation doesn\u2019t know about what we went through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see a lot of kids in college who feel that they don\u2019t owe anything to their community,\u201d said Jessica, the former Cesar Chavez campaigner, who has returned to college at 36. \u201cWe have a lot more of everything than before\u2014more legislators, educators, more kids in college\u2014but something\u2019s missing.\u201d\n\nRecalling the intensity of the 1960s and the concessions that were won, Ofelia is frustrated by cuts in school funds at a time when Latino students are quickly becoming a majority in city schools.\n\n\u201cI see us backsliding . . . .After the movement, people thought, \u2018Now everything\u2019s going to be all right,\u2019 and they didn\u2019t continue working at it. Instead, people became specialized, concentrating on their own field,\u201d she said reflecting on her own experience.\n\nOthers complain that upward mobile Chicanos have become complacent with their middle-class trappings.\n\nRudy\u2019s son William, now assistant dean of students at Occidental College, said the present generation is living \u201ca life of contrasts . . . .They seem divided. Many of them are being opportunistic and losing a lot of cultural things. They haven\u2019t taken the time to look at their own history and develop the appreciation for what we have . . . .Some of them do.\n\nWilliam Estrada at Occidental College in 1983. (Bob Chamberlin / Los Angeles Times)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what is winning out.\u201d\n\nStill, there is faith in La Raza\u2019s endurance.\n\nThe family\u2019s leading members continue to focus attention on family history and heritage and are determined to pass it on to their children. Reflecting a trend in the community, several have taken to calling themselves Mexicanos, coming full circle with the term that Guadalupe has always used. It is a way of connecting with the past as well with continuing immigration from Mexico.\n\nOfelia\u2019s son, Ben, expressed it this way:\n\n\u201cThe family stories\u2014like the tales we were told in school about George Washington\u2014have given me a strong sense of where I\u2019ve been, so that I can better understand where I\u2019m going.\n\n\u201cI know about my grandmother\u2019s struggle as a Mexican woman in a new country . . .and about my parents\u2019 struggles. And when you put all the pieces together you come up with one thing: the importance of family, of belonging to a group.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the evolvement of a piece of history . . . .I think that people who have lived on the same land for generations have a feeling for that land. My ancestors have died and been buried here and they are part of this land. Los Angeles is our home.\u201d\n\n::\n\nIn the Mexican town of Nochistlan, where the family\u2019s story began, much remains the same as at the turn of the century, when young Arcadio Yniguez walked its cobblestone streets.\n\nWomen wrapped in their rebozos and horsemen in wide-brimmed charro hats still populate this dusty town where stories of hidden treasure are still told and folk healers practice the medical arts if their Indian ancestors.\n\nAnd young men still wonder, as Arcadio did before he began his turn-of-the-century journey north to Chicago, whether a better life awaits them beyond the surrounding hillsides. The average daily wage in the drought-ridden region is about $2.\n\nPioneers like Arcadio and the thousands who have spun an intricate web of family ties that bridge two realities and perpetuate the timeless process connecting two countries.\n\nNow, an occasional Los Angeles-style cholo, in khaki pants, white shirt and derby hat, strolls under the Spanish colonial-style arches of the marketplace. Pickup trucks with California license plates share the streets with cattle.\n\nOn a recent evening, 22-year-old Alvaro Jimenez, a distant relative of Arcadio Yniguez, paused athe town\u2019s central plaza, an oasis in the middle of white-washed adobe homes and a cactus-studded-countryside, to ponder the future.\n\nLike most of his relatives and friends who come and go between the two countries, Alvaro is part of the latest generation of immigrants from Nochistlan. \u201cIt is very rare to find a man in town who hasn\u2019t gone to El Norte,\u201d he said.\n\nRecently Alvaro returned home after a year of working in California. Along the way, he visited his uncle, Samuel Yniguez, the tailor, in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cThis time I almost didn\u2019t come back,\u201d Alvaro said.\n\nBut he is still not sure whether he will settle in Mexico or in the United States.\n\n\u201cI have family in both places. To me, it\u2019s pretty much the same here or there,\u201d he said.\n\nThose who remember the patriarch Arcadio\u2019s restless spirit and self-composed manner find a likeness in young Alvaro Jimenez.\n\nAsked what he remembers of his forerunner, Alvaro shrugged.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard the name, but I don\u2019t know much about him. He died some time ago, didn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nThis story appeared in print before the digital era and was later added to our digital archive."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-12-12/vicente-fernandez-death-el-rey-mexicans-california", "page_content": "This fall has been a season of death for the people of my ancestral town of Jerez, Zacatecas.\n\nThe daughter of an Anaheim High classmate of mine passed away last month.

Now, his tone was happier. He was suddenly 18 years old, a self-described mojado \u2014 a wetback \u2014 who had just arrived in East Los Angeles in 1969 to join his brothers in a new country.

In a time and place where Americans and even Mexican Americans shunned Mexican immigrants, my dad and his peers felt seen, and their way of life validated.\n\nChente\u2019s triumphs became the triumphs of Dad and his generation as they found their own success.

My dad and his brothers went from sharing beds to buying their own suburban homes.\n\nThe star and his fans conquered el Norte by adhering to rancho libertarianism, a philosophy that celebrates bootstrap individualism in a way that makes Ayn Rand seem like a commune-dwelling hippie.

There were never any excuses offered for hardships \u2014 just pride in being able to beat them down.\n\nLatinos became the largest minority in the United States as Chente and my dad\u2019s generation became older. My generation went from hearing Chente as the forced soundtrack of our weekends \u2014 he remained on the radio even as we begged our parents to let us play Nirvana or 2Pac \u2014 to a nostalgia act. He, like our parents, moved on into the realm of myth, until no longer quite human but living relics.\n\nTheir style of mexicanidad is now in its winter. Machismo, the moral code that defined Mexican manhood for centuries, is no longer winked at or accepted. Immigrants from Zacatecas and Jalisco no longer dominate the social and cultural life of Southern California \u2014 it\u2019s now people from Sinaloa, Oaxaca, Mexico City. Chente\u2019s music is now largely ceremonial, not contemporary.\n\nAnd as those days end, the reexamination of them is in full effect. Right now on social media, critics are listing Chente\u2019s errors \u2014 his performance at the 2000 Republican National Convention, homophobic and sexist comments over the decades. Fern\u00e1ndez got in trouble as recently as this January, when a photo of him groping a female fan went viral online, a transgression for which the octogenarian apologized even as he tried to play it off as no big deal.\n\nNo one will miss those moments or the worldview that tolerated them. But those defects are also a reminder that the totality of someone\u2019s life should supersede their mistakes. Chente\u2019s life is a way to look at our parents as who they were and are \u2014 flawed people whose feats inspired us to try and match their heights instead of mimic their faults.\n\nThat\u2019s why the soundtrack in Southern California this Sunday is Chente and will be so for the next couple of days. Already, I\u2019ve heard my middle-class Chicano neighbors, the ones whose Spanish is worse than mine, blast his music. The same with the taqueria near my wife\u2019s restaurant and the random cars that pass by.\n\nI\u2019m playing Chente as well \u2014 to honor his legacy but also the elders in my community we\u2019ve lost in the past couple of weeks and will lose in the years to come. To mark the end of an era, and to think about what\u2019s next for us.\n\nI\u2019ll blast Chente and think about my father \u2014 an imperfect man who nevertheless has accomplished great things and now waits for his day to come. The song I\u2019m playing on repeat is \u201cPaloma Errante\u201d (\u201cWandering Dove\u201d), a 1970 track that topped the charts just after my dad came to East L.A.\n\n\u201cI raise my prayers to heaven / So that it calm my suffering,\u201d Chente crooned \u2014 almost wept. \u201cEternal God, don\u2019t abandon me / Give me joy, and the future.\u201d\n\nQue descanse en paz, mi Chente."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/rudy-fernandez/", "page_content": "Rodolfo Valentino Padilla Fernandez, better known as Rudy Fernandez or Daboy (born Rodolfo Padilla Fernandez; March 3, 1952 \u2013 June 7, 2008), was a multi-awarded Filipino actor and producer. He came to prominence as an action star in the Philippine cinema during the 1980s up to the early 1990s.\n\nCareer\n\nFernandez was born at 8:36 PM on March 3, 1952 at Mary Johnston Hospital in Tondo, Manila. He is the eldest son of the late film director Gregorio Fernandez and actress Pilar Padilla. Both his parents were from Lubao, Pampanga, which he considered his hometown. He made his film debut at the age of three, appearing in Luksang Tagumpay (1956), which was directed by his father. He also appeared in another film of his father's, Emily (1960).\n\nFernandez started his active film career while a student at the University of Santo Tomas, when he was signed to a contract by Sampaguita Pictures in 1970. He was first featured by Sampaguita Pictures in For Your Mama (1970), then paired with Connie Angeles in Sweet Matutina (1970). Fernandez spent the next few years in teenage parts until he made his breakthrough as an action star with Bitayin si Baby Ama (1976). His viability as an action star was further enhanced with the box-office success of Ang Leon, Ang Tigre at ang Alamid (1979).\n\nBeginning with ..Baby Ama, a biopic of a well-known Filipino criminal, Fernandez specialized in portraying true-to-life characters. One of his notable action films is Markang Bungo (Skull Mark), a film based on a true story, where he portrayed the well-known Baguio City police officer Bobby Ortega, was released in 1992. From this film came a signature line of Fernandez's, \"Walang personalan, trabaho lang\" (\"Strictly business, nothing personal\"), which has since been cited as among the most memorable quotes in Philippine cinema by QTV's Ang Pinaka television program. Iligpit si Bobby Ortega, Markang Bungo 2 (Execute Bobby Ortega, Skull Mark 2) is a sequel that was released in 1995. Aside for portraying a real police officer, he was cast in the lead roles for the biopics of Filipino politicians Alfredo Lim, Vincent Crisologo, and Ping Lacson. In the film Lagalag: The Eddie Fernandez Story, he starred as Eddie Fernandez, a Filipino actor during the 1970s and the father of Pops Fernandez.\n\nWith the decline of production of Filipino action films during the 2000s, Fernandez turned to television roles. In the short-lived GMA Network sitcom Da Boy, en Da Girl, he starred opposite Rosanna Roces. He also played as a supporting role in other TV series in GMA like Twin Hearts and Atlantika. He was also the host of the docu-drama Kasangga.\n\nAwards\n\nFernandez has won two FAMAS Best Actor awards for the action films Batuigas...Pasukuin si Waway (Batuigas...Make Waway to Surrender) (1984) and Operation: Get Victor Corpuz, The Rebel Soldier (1988). In addition to these wins, FAMAS has also nominated Rudy Fernandez an additional 13 times from 1976 to 1998. He also won two FAP Best Actor awards for Batuigas... and for Birador (1998).\n\nThe Philippine Movie Press Club (PMPC) bestowed the 2008 Ulirang Artista Lifetime Achievement Award to Rudy Fernandez, at the 24th Star Awards for Movies. He was also the recipient of the Film Academy of the Philippines FPJ Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2007, FAMAS awarded him the Fernando Poe, Jr. Memorial Award.\n\nPersonal life\n\nFernandez hometown is Lubao, Pampanga. He came from famous Padilla showbiz clan in his maternal side. Robin Padilla, Rustom Padilla, Gino Padilla, are his cousins and Zsa Zsa Padilla is a niece. He has one son, Mark Anthony Fernandez, with former partner Alma Moreno and two sons, Raphael Fernandez and Renz Fernandez with Lorna Tolentino, his wife. His grandson Grae (son of Mark Anthony Fernandez) joined showbiz.\n\nHe was survived by his wife, sons, and cousins; consequently, as he is the Padilla brothers' cousin, his grandson, Grae Fernandez, is the nephew of teen king Daniel Padilla.\n\nPolitics\n\nDuring the 2001 elections, Fernandez ran for mayor of Quezon City under the banner of the Puwersa ng Masa. Although he garnered most of the votes in District 2 where the voters were composed mostly of indigent citizens, he lost in the remaining three districts and was defeated by then-House Speaker Sonny Belmonte of the People Power Coalition.\n\nIllness and death\n\nIn 2007, it was revealed by Lorna Tolentino on Startalk that her husband had been diagnosed with periampullary cancer. Fernandez underwent treatment in Tokyo, Japan. After a healing Mass on May 10, 2008 by several friends at the Christ the King Church, Quezon City, he was rushed to a San Juan City hospital for back pains. The Sun Star reported that Fernandez was actually suffering from pancreatic cancer, instead.\n\nFernandez celebrated his 25th wedding anniversary with Lorna Tolentino on June 1, 2008. He suffered a seizure three days later on June 4, but refused to be taken back to the Cardinal Santos Memorial Center in San Juan City.\n\nFernandez died from periampullary cancer at his home in Quezon City on the morning of June 7, 2008. His remains were brought to The Heritage Park in Taguig City, and his interment took place on June 12, 2008 at 3 p.m. for his burial."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/world/americas/migrants-mexico-texas.html", "page_content": "SAN MARCOS ATESQUILAPAN, Mexico \u2014 The teenage brothers were among some 80 young men who had left San Marcos in the last two months, a growing exodus from this impoverished village of 1,600 that sits in the lush mountains of Veracruz state.\n\nOn Monday at around 11 a.m., Yovani jubilantly texted his father from the American side of the border: \u201cDad, now we\u2019re going to San Antonio.\u201d\n\nThat was the last their family heard from Jair, 19, and Yovani, 16.

But this fact would probably surprise the descendants of these immigrants, in part because their ties to the past are looser than those of other ethnic communities. Fern\u00e1ndez has found that Spanish-Americans living in, say, Donora, Pa., tend not to know of similar communities in places like Cherryvalle, Kan., or even Tampa, Fla.. Whereas the contributions of Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans are celebrated and mythologized in museums and parades galore, U.S. cities offer few cultural landmarks commemorating the Spanish-American experience.\n\nBut Fern\u00e1ndez is out to change that. Since 2010, he and his collaborator, the Spanish filmmaker and journalist Luis Argeo, have been traveling the country to conduct interviews and collect photographs and documents that tell the all-but-forgotten story of the scores of Spanish immigrants who settled\u2014and quickly assimilated\u2014in towns from Vermont to Hawaii during the first decades of the 20th century. The grandson of Spanish immigrants who met and married in New York City in the 1920s, Fern\u00e1ndez says he grew up believing that his grandparents\u2019 journey here was unique\u2014a perception that his interview subjects often share.\n\n\u201cThis has become a lesson about how public memory is inscribed in private photo albums,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says of the archiving project, which he calls \u201cNi Frailes ni Conquistadores (Neither Friars nor Conquistadors): Spanish Immigrants in the U.S., 1898-1936.\u201d As the 80- or 90-year-old daughters and sons of Spanish immigrants, Fernandez\u2019s sources are often able to put names to faces in family photos\u2014but don\u2019t always know the significance of pictures that were taken when they were still in diapers.\n\n\u201cVery often the owners of these photo albums can\u2019t see beyond their private, intimate meaning\u2014but to someone with a historical perspective, they often contain valuable information,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. Among his own family\u2019s possessions, for example, Fern\u00e1ndez recently identified an unfamiliar man photographed with a group of his relatives as Jos\u00e9 Miaja, the Spanish Republican Army commander who led the defense of Madrid against siege by General Francisco Franco\u2019s troops during the Spanish Civil War.\n\nFor now, Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s growing archive lives online, and with the students in his 2011 undergraduate seminar on Spain in New York he built a website marking historic Spanish sites at and around NYU\u2019s Greenwich Village campus, which overlaps the neighborhood once known as New Spain. He and Argeo have also built a Facebook page, called Spanish Immigrants in the United States, where they post four times a day, sharing documents, photographs, and newspaper clippings and soliciting the same from their growing following of more than 2,000. Photos they share of celebrities, like the glamorous Rita Hayworth, whose father emigrated from Spain, garner a predictable flurry of \u201clikes.\u201d And food? \u201cIt drives \u2019em crazy!\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cI can start a fight on Facebook over who makes the best chorizo, or where the best Christmas cookies come from.\u201d\n\nBut the social network has also proved a valuable scholarly tool: Fern\u00e1ndez and Argeo have planned trips to St. Louis, Mo., San Leandro, Ca., to meet with Spanish-Americans with whom they first connected through Facebook. Their main source in Cleveland, a former flight attendant who had been carefully preserving her Spanish grandparents\u2019 archive, also found their project through the page. No two family\u2019s histories are identical, of course, but part of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s charge is to stitch those apparently isolated stories into a broader narrative about an overlooked diaspora.\n\nThere were myriad reasons for leaving Spain in the first two decades of the 20th century: The Spanish economy was in shambles following the loss of its colonies in Cuba, the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War of 1898, and military conscription meant that young men could expect to die in similar bloody battles in Northern Africa as the former imperial power dwindled. Fleeing these conditions, many Spaniards moved first to Spanish-speaking Latin America, and then made their way from Mexico or Cuba to the United States. Others were recruited directly for work in specific industries, from sugarcane to canal digging to zinc mining.\n\n\u201cAssimilation, for most of these folks, was incredibly fast and successful,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says\u2014which could be one reason few traces of Spanish identity remain in the communities where they settled. Another has to do with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Fernandez suspects that much Spanish settlement in the United States was somewhat accidental: Immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in the 1910s and 1920s with no intention of planting roots here decided not to return home only after Spain\u2019s democratic government was overthrown in Francisco Franco\u2019s fascist coup. His hypothesis is supported by a curious pattern he\u2019s noticed in family documents\u2014a glut of U.S. naturalization papers dated 1939, \u201940, and \u201941 for people who\u2019d been in the country since 1920 or earlier.\n\nComplicating things further is the fact that those who opposed Franco and supported Spain\u2019s democratic loyalists ended up being targeted as communists during the McCarthy era\u2014leading some Spanish families to keep quiet about their roots. It\u2019s a practice analogous to German-Americans abandoning their own native celebrations and associations in the years following World War I. \u201cWe\u2019ve even found cases of families destroying or tearing the inscriptions off of photographs,\" Fernandez says. In that sense, he says, the stories that descendants of immigrants tend to misremember or even obscure are often as illuminating as the family memories they cherish.\n\nFor Fern\u00e1ndez, \u201cNi frailes ni conquistadores\u201d is also a journey of personal discovery: Though he\u2019s taught Spanish language and literature for years, it wasn\u2019t until recently that he contemplated the intersections between his academic interests and his family history. \u201cFor years I taught Federico Garcia Lorca, who came to New York in 1929 and wrote one of his major books of poems, Poeta in Nueva York, here,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez reflects. \u201cBut it never occurred to me that Lorca and abuelo [grandfather] inhabited the same sphere.\u201d\n\nReading Lorca\u2019s letters from New York back to his family in Spain, Fern\u00e1ndez found a mention of a lunch at a dive on the Hudson River that finally helped him to make the connection. \u201cLorca described the owner as an astute guy from Galicia who was selling bootleg liquor,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been my grandfather serving that anise.\u201d\n\nView the slideshow above to take Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s historic tour through hidden Spanish-American outposts in the U.S.\n\nTop photo: Cleveland Spanish community picnic, June 1942, courtesy of Laura Goyanes. Employment opportunities in the heavy industries (steel, rubber, etc.) in and around Cleveland attracted large numbers of Spanish immigrants to the area in the 1910s and \u201920s, among them the Galician-born father of Oscar-winning actor Martin Sheen, who lived and worked in Dayton.\n\n\n\n\u2014Eileen Reynolds\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/california/story/2021-12-12/vicente-fernandez-death-el-rey-mexicans-california", "page_content": "Mexican actor and singer Vicente Fernandez performs on stage during a concert at the VFG Arena in Guadalajara, Mexico, Saturday, Oct. 31, 2009.

He, like our parents, moved on into the realm of myth, until no longer quite human but living relics.\n\nTheir style of mexicanidad is now in its winter. Machismo, the moral code that defined Mexican manhood for centuries, is no longer winked at or accepted. Immigrants from Zacatecas and Jalisco no longer dominate the social and cultural life of Southern California \u2014 it\u2019s now people from Sinaloa, Oaxaca, Mexico City. Chente\u2019s music is now largely ceremonial, not contemporary.\n\nAnd as those days end, the reexamination of them is in full effect. Right now on social media, critics are listing Chente\u2019s errors \u2014 his performance at the 2000 Republican National Convention, homophobic and sexist comments over the decades. Fern\u00e1ndez got in trouble as recently as this January, when a photo of him groping a female fan went viral online, a transgression for which the octogenarian apologized even as he tried to play it off as no big deal.\n\nNo one will miss those moments or the worldview that tolerated them. But those defects are also a reminder that the totality of someone\u2019s life should supersede their mistakes. Chente\u2019s life is a way to look at our parents as who they were and are \u2014 flawed people whose feats inspired us to try to match their heights instead of mimic their faults.\n\nThat\u2019s why the soundtrack in Southern California this Sunday is Chente and will be so for the next couple of days. Already, I\u2019ve heard my middle-class Chicano neighbors, the ones whose Spanish is worse than mine, blast his music. The same with the taqueria near my wife\u2019s restaurant and the random cars that pass by.\n\nI\u2019m playing Chente as well \u2014 to honor his legacy but also the elders in my community we\u2019ve lost in the past couple of weeks and will lose in the years to come. To mark the end of an era, and to think about what\u2019s next for us.\n\nI\u2019ll blast Chente and think about my father \u2014 an imperfect man who nevertheless has accomplished great things and now waits for his day to come. The song I\u2019m playing on repeat is \u201cPaloma Errante\u201d (\u201cWandering Dove\u201d), a 1970 track that topped the charts just after my dad came to East L.A.\n\n\u201cI raise my prayers to heaven / So that it calm my suffering\u201d Chente crooned \u2014 almost wept. \u201cEternal God, don\u2019t abandon me / Give me joy, and the future.\u201d\n\nQue descanse en paz, mi Chente."}, {"url": "https://www.peopleareculture.com/san-miguel-de-allende/", "page_content": "There is a little-known human drama that led to San Miguel de Allende becoming one of the world's premiere arts and culture destinations. Let us share it with you.\n\nSan Miguel de Allende is located practically in the dead center of Mexico, in the state of Guanajuato, about 170 miles north of Mexico City. Renowned for its Colonial charm, San Miguel's 64-block historic center was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008. Twice voted by readers of Travel + Leisure as their favorite city in the world, San Miguel de Allende is a mecca for artsy and affluent expats.\n\nWhy is this dusty, arid, high-altitude plateau far from Mexico's alluring coasts such a draw for discerning travelers?\n\nTwo words: Instituto Allende.\n\nThanks to this visual arts school, San Miguel was transformed from a down-on-its-luck ghost town into a vibrant, cosmopolitan mecca for culture-lovers.\n\nNow a world class arts destination, San Miguel emerged from humble origins as an indigenous Chichimeca village and then a Spanish mission and military outpost. In the 17th century, San Miguel became a wealthy enclave, thanks to the discovery of silver in the area and the development of textile manufacturing.\n\nBy the 1750s, the population of San Miguel de Allende was more than that of New York City and the prosperous merchants and hacienda owners built the stunning Baroque and Neoclassical mansions and churches that are such a draw today.\n\nAlas, in the early 19th century the start of the Mexican Revolution and the end of the silver mines brought about the collapse of San Miguel's economy, an exodus of inhabitants, and the looting of its romantic architecture that was left to ruin.\n\nEveryone loves a juicy turn-around story and publications from National Geographic to Smithsonian Magazine have reported on San Miguel's metamorphosis from a down-and-out commercial center to the grande dame of Mexico's Pueblo Magicos. Generally, credit for how Instituto Allende transformed San Miguel has been given to U.S. expat Stirling Dickinson.\n\nIn our interview with Instituto Allende Director Rodolfo \"Rudy\" Fernandez, he reveals who was really the force behind the school's founding and survival: his parents Guanajuato native son Enriquez Fernandez Martinez and his American wife Nell Harris.\n\nGuanajuato Native Son A Catalyst for San Miguel Allure\n\nMeg: The Instituto is the reason that San Miguel has become such a flourishing artist community, so let\u2019s begin with how it all started.\n\nRudy: A little family history first. My father was born in 1896 in the north part of the Mexican state of Guanajuato in a little town called San Felipe Torres Mochas, where his father was the telegraph operator. After grade school, he started working as a cleanup boy in a lawyer\u2019s office, and he got involved in the practice of that office and started learning the trade.\n\nIn 1910, when Mexico had its revolution, my father was 14 years old and participated on the side of the people who wanted a republic. His brother, Jose Luis, was one of the members of Congress who signed the 1917 Mexican Constitution that we still have today. But my uncle died quite young, and I guess this motivated my father to get involved in politics. He ran for office and, over the years, won various posts like mayor of Guanajuato and member of Congress.\n\nApprehending an Assassin in San Miguel de Allende\n\nIn 1928, he was present at a luncheon in Mexico City for the president-elect, Alvaro Obregon. A cartoonist came up and asked permission to show the president some cartoons that he had drawn while they were having lunch. Then he drew out a pistol and shot him. My father and General Mugica apprehended the killer, Leon Toral, a religious extremist who was later tried and executed. Rumors were that the Catholic Church had been behind that assassination.\n\nIn 1939, my father was elected constitutional governor of the state of Guanajuato, which includes the city of San Miguel de Allende. A very honest, well-respected, admired man, he was connected to two groups: The Reds was more left wing and the Green Party, was more republican and liberal. The president of Mexico was General Lazaro Cardenas, the principal mover of social reform in the mid-twentieth century. And my father worked with him.\n\nWhat Are You Doing in San Miguel de Allende?\n\nMeg: So, your father was interested in reform and education before he became connected with the school? What was happening in the town of San Miguel de Allende before he became involved?\n\nRudy: Since the Revolution, San Miguel had been attracting a lot of very famous actors, actresses, singers, and composers. Among them was Jose Mojica, a Chicago opera singer who became a movie actor in the 1930s and moved to San Miguel de Allende.\n\nStirling Dickinson, who was from the Chicago area, was traveling as a youth through Mexico and on the train in Oaxaca recognized Jose Mojica. He said, \u201cMr Mojica, I know who you are; I\u2019ve seen movies. What are you doing here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m traveling because I have been looking for a place to build a house for my mother, and I have chosen San Miguel de Allende for it, and I hope you can come and see the town.\u201d\n\nTrio of Artist, Actor and Exile Meet In San Miguel de Allende\n\nStirling had also met a Peruvian political exile in Mexico, whose name was Felipe Cossio del Pomar. The story is that del Pomar stopped in San Miguel de Allende at the train station, and I think they had about a two-hour wait, and he drove up in the mule cart for passengers from the train station to San Miguel de Allende. It was early in the morning and the colors were brilliant. He stayed and, with Stirling, formed the Universidad de Bellas Artes, the first art school in San Miguel de Allende in 1937. It was registered with the Department of Education both in Canada and the United States.\n\nWhen Jose Mojica, Cossio del Pomar, and Stirling Dickinson started looking for a better building, they went to see the governor of Guanajuato. That was my father. My father called former president General Lazaro Cardenas, who was then head of the army. Lazaro Cardenas called the president, Manuel Avila Camacho, and they found a building that had once been a convent but, because of the separation of church and state, had been taken away from the church and given to the army. Now it was taken away from the army and given to a group of foreigners that wanted to start an art school.\n\nBringing Together Foreign Students and Mexican Artisans\n\nMeg: Why did they choose to give the property to foreigners? Was it because they felt the foreigners were bringing something to the community, there was a positive partnership, or these foreigners were going to create something worthwhile?\n\nRudy: In the 1920s, President Alvaro Obregon opened the first Department of Education of Mexico, and chose an intellectual named Jose Vasconcelos to head it. Its motto was \u201cEducate the People.\u201d Felipe Cossio del Pomar and Jose Vasconcelos had the idea that they could do that through art. So, the project of the art school was not only to receive foreign students but to integrate Mexican craft artists into an academic field.\n\nEnriquez Invests in Seven Hectares in San Miguel de Allende\n\nMeg: I love that!\n\nRudy: My father knew about the art school in the late \u201830s, early \u201840s and when he retired in 1944 after being governor, this group went to see him. They said, \u201cThere\u2019s a big spread of land in San Miguel de Allende, and we want to put the school there, but we don\u2019t have enough money to do it, so we want you to participate.\u201d And my father said, \u201cOkay. That\u2019s an interesting idea.\u201d\n\nMy father sold his property in Guanajuato, and, because he was very well-connected in the political and financial worlds, he was able to secure loans at low interest, and purchase this land spread that was 7 hectares and included where the Rosewood Hotel is now.\n\nMeg: Did your father take these loans out himself or did the group take them out as an organization?\n\nRudy: He took them out himself because they knew that he had a good line of credit. As I said, he was an honest, respected person, so the bankers did not hesitate. Plus, they had the property for a guarantee, securing the loan.\n\nMeg: The property was bought from the de la Canal Family?\n\nRudy: It was Roberto Lambarri de la Canal. He owned an abandoned old pecan orchard with many decrepit buildings. The main courtyard had to be completely renovated, which became a job for my mother.\n\nLove at First Sight\n\nMeg: Ah! And how did your mother become part of this story? How did she meet your father?\n\nRudy: Well, that\u2019s an interesting story.\n\nMeg: Tell me.\n\nRudy: My mother was from a little rural town in Arkansas. She came to Mexico with her mother \u2013 my grandmother \u2013 chasing her father, who had abandoned them. He was working for a transnational, English-American company in the lumber industry outside of Mexico City. My mother met the general director of the plant, an Englishman by the name of Donald Barlow. She married Barlow and had a baby girl, my sister Barbara. Then Mr Barlow became director of the English-American tobacco company in Guanajuato and they moved there. At that time, my father was governor of the state, and at one of the social events with the foreign community, he set eyes on my mother. History did the rest. Eventually, my mother divorced Mr Barlow and, years later, married my father.\n\nMeg: At that time how was divorce perceived, socially?\n\nRudy: Oh, it was not seen as proper. It was one of the biggest sins in the Catholic religion. My mother was very badly treated, and my father also suffered, because being a politician married to a foreigner wasn\u2019t the best in those times.\n\nBefore your trip, learn more about the culture in Mexico!\n\nAdvising the President\n\nOnce my father came back to San Miguel de Allende and started renovating the new location, he retired from the active life of politics. But still, the president of Mexico would come every year and stay in the Instituto Allende hotel. My father was a counselor to the president for three or four presidential terms, reporting directly to him, and telling him of the state of the nation. The president would ask, \u201cWell, what do you recommend for Guanajuato?\u201d \u201cWell, I think this, that, or\u2026\u201d Up until his death, my father was active as an unofficial member of the cabinet.\n\nMeg: I believe when President Kennedy was in office, he had a \u201ckitchen cabinet.\u201d That was the term for his informal cabinet. Close advisors who didn\u2019t hold an official role, but were \u2013\n\nRudy: Were active \u2013behind the scenes, more or less. I grew up in that type of environment, seeing governors, high politicians, presidents of Mexico stay at the hotel that my family owned, have dinner and breakfast at my house. And that carried a lot of weight.\n\nMeg: Of course, so, it\u2019s a responsibility?\n\nCleaning House\n\nRudy: Yes. My father decided that the relationship with the Peruvian del Pomar person regarding the art school wasn\u2019t going too well. Polmar had sold the school to a Mexican lawyer named Alfredo Campanella and left Mexico. Campanella did not run things very well. By then, the first group of Americans studying under the GI bill had arrived, a huge boost to the school\u2019s revenues. But Campanella was pocketing the money. When Campanella hired David Alfaro Siqueiros to paint a mural at the school, the funds weren\u2019t arriving to pay for the materials. The students revolted. Campanella went and worked his political ties in Mexico City, and declared that the school was a center for Communist education.\n\nThe Mexican government expelled all the foreign professors from Mexico, including Dickinson, James Pinto, Leonard Brooks, and their wives. My father cleared up the situation, and they were all authorized to come back to Mexico.\n\nThe Doors Finally Open to Instituto Allende\n\nMeg: Let me just clarify. Your father bought out the Peruvian?\n\nRudy: Felipe Cossio del Pomar went back to Peru because his political situation got fixed. He helped a candidate to become president of Peru and was offered the post of Secretary of Education of Peru. Before the Instituto started, in the late 40s, my father bought him out and became sole proprietor. At that time, San Miguel de Allende had a population of around, 6,700 to 8,000.\n\nMeg: And the Instituto finally opened its doors in 1950?\n\nRudy: Yes. Stirling was very influential in marketing the school. He wasn\u2019t part owner; he was a director. He ran it very academically through councils \u2013 student councils, and teachers\u2019 councils. Most of the teachers came just because they had heard of the Instituto, or of San Miguel de Allende, and they came, and they liked it.\n\nHow the G.I. Bill Saved San Miguel de Allende\n\nMeg: I know Instituto Allende has a connection with American military veterans. Can you explain this connection?\n\nRudy: The G.I. Bill is a law that was passed in the United States in 1944, in order to benefit American soldiers who had fought in World War II, and provide them with a legal mechanism that would allow them to have financing for technical or university studies, along with a pension that helps their subsistence. Stirling Dickinson managed to join the G.I Bill thanks to his contacts and excellent promotional work, thus attracting several American war veterans to the school. This flow of former foreign soldiers not only represented an economic boom for the University School but also income for the local merchants of San Miguel de Allende, as money began to flow in the city, which had been dragging a depressed economy for more than a century.\n\nAttracted by the possibility of obtaining academic credits for studies carried out in Mexico, an increasing number of American veterans, with the support of the G.I. Bill, found a place in San Miguel de Allende, either to live, or to return frequently, even bringing friends with him, thereby further strengthening the city's economy.\n\nG.I. Bill Continues to Attract Veterans to San Miguel de Allende Today\n\nToday, seventy years after its founding, the Instituto Allende continues to be on the list of schools that the G.I. Bill offers to its affiliates. Each semester American war veterans attend seeking to learn or improve their Spanish or take some of the many art courses the Institute offers. Currently, the Instituto Allende offers G.I. Bill the Full Immersion Spanish course, which includes not only regular grammar and conversation classes but also educational games, discussion workshops on music and movies in Spanish, as well as lectures and field trips to historical and tourist places in Mexico, which makes learning the language a fun and interesting experience.\n\nWith just two semesters of classes in the Full Immersion program, beginning veterans are able to speak and understand Spanish, while those who already have some knowledge considerably improve their language comprehension, conversation, reading and writing skills. For the more advanced, Full Immersion has the modality of Latin American Letters where the student improves their understanding and interpretation of literary texts, as well as their writing in the Spanish language.\n\nAnother study option for GI Bill veterans at the Instituto Allende is the art workshops, which include sculpture, painting, ceramics, photography, traditional Mexican weaving, and jewelry. The veteran student can unleash their creativity and experience new sensations and personal feelings while learning and applying the various techniques of art.\n\nSeeking Out Educated Teachers for San Miguel de Allende\n\nMeg: How did the Instituto find its teachers?\n\nRudy: Fred Samuelson and Sylvia Samuelson came for a three-month holiday in Mexico. They arrived in December in San Miguel de Allende when Christmas festivities were going on and they felt enchanted with the city, so they stayed. They rented a little apartment up on the hill, and Fred would go out and walk their little dog, and one day he met Stirling Dickinson.\n\n\u201dWhere did you study?\u201d Stirling asked.\n\nFred said, \u201cAt Pratt Institute.\u201d\n\nSo, Stirling offered him a job teaching painting. That\u2019s how most of the professors came. When there was an archaeologist in town, the archaeology department opened. When there were several writers, the writers\u2019 workshop would open.\n\nThe Best of the Best in Education\n\nMeg: So, would the right word be it was kind of organic? Serendipitous?\n\nRudy: Yes. The magic of San Miguel de Allende drew amazing people. That first group of professors chose to live in an unknown place in a little remote city in Mexico, away from the main art scenes in New York, Chicago, and Paris. They came here just wanting to work and wanting to share that work. Every night, different families would host the rest of the faculty, and they would have critiques, and they would enrich themselves within this group.\n\nIn the early \u201840s, you could rent a home for $10.00 to $15.00, but you had to use an outhouse for the bathroom, and you would wash in the fountain of the courtyard of the house. But as students started coming, people started fixing rooms up to rent, and a little cluster of apartments owned by foreigners was established.\n\n\u201cLet me call Engelbreck,\u201d someone would say\u2014he had the first student apartment up on the hill.\n\nStrained Relations Between America and Mexico\n\nMeg: \u201cCenters of influence,\u201d is a business term, but what you\u2019re describing is how communities, organizations, or places create the leaders and spread a movement out into the world.\n\nRudy: Yes, but there was trouble. In 1982, the United States' crackdown on drug trafficking was focused on Mexico. A DEA agent named Enrique Camarena was kidnapped and killed by a cartel leader named Caro Quintero. The U.S. State Department responded by issuing warnings about travel to Mexico. Students stopped coming and suddenly the school had to close. The faculty and workers all were on the payroll and they all had Social Security, and suddenly there was no more income. On a Friday, my mother decided to close the school.\n\nNot Taking No For an Answer\n\nMeg: Was your mother running the school at this point?\n\nRudy: Yes. My father died in 1968. My mother took charge. She would wake up at 5:00 in the morning and see about preparing breakfast for the students staying in the Instituto Allende Hotel. There were not too many grocery stores in town, and there was no food processing. We grew everything that was cooked. We raised lamb and chickens. Few places were as modern as there are now, and there were no luxury places.\n\nWith Stirling Dickinson as director, my mother was the financial administrator. These travel warnings in the \u201980s hit hard. One Friday, my mother announced that she had to close the school. She promised severance pay for all the workers, but not in one lump sum. \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll be paying you monthly until we pay you everything,\u201d she said. But the following Monday, a group of professors came to talk to her and said, \u201cWhat are we going to do? This is our life, so, why don\u2019t we just work here, and see what happens?\u201d That\u2019s when I came into the life of the school.\n\nSetting Up a Financial Plan\n\nMeg: How old were you?\n\nRudy: Twenty-eight. So, I come in and, with some help, set up a financial business plan. I determined how many courses we had, and what the income for the month was, and what department brought what amount of income. It was very rustic, simple math. I said, \u201c\u2013 22 percent of the income of this month came from the Spanish department; 17 percent came from the painting area\u2026,\u201d like that. Running the school, just keeping the doors open, amounted to so much, so I would apply the percentage of the income for each department and charge the operating expenses proportionally to each one.\n\nMeg: But how did you know how to do this?\n\nRudy: I went to grade school here in town, where I was one of the favorite students, but my family moved me to Mexico City. It didn\u2019t go well with me, leaving home that early in my life. Coming home for a weekend, I just broke down, and didn\u2019t want to go back. I stayed, but I started having academic problems.\n\nAt that time, we didn\u2019t know about the chemical imbalances of the brain. We just thought that you were lazy, or not doing what was expected. I was threatened that if I didn\u2019t shape up, I would face consequences, namely being sent to a military school. So, I ended up in Virginia in a military school run by nuns.\n\nMeg: What a combination.\n\nRudy: The military part was run by an abusive Navy veteran. I didn\u2019t do well. I was only there for a semester. My mother heard about another school in San Antonio, Texas, so I went there. When I arrived at the San Antonio Academy, Colonel Bondurant said, \u201cYou\u2019re not up to snuff with your language, so we\u2019re going to put you back to sixth grade. If you do well, we\u2019ll skip the seventh grade, and put you in the eighth grade.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fair\u201d and I started shaping up.\n\nRead More: Planning to visit San Miguel de Allende?

Then you must also get to know Bill LeVasseur, the founder of Another Face of Mexico Mask Museum which is home to incredible Mayan masks\n\nIt Takes One Dedicated Person to Change a Life\n\nMeg: Do you attribute that to the environment, or to your kind of coming into yourself a little bit, or both?\n\nRudy: I attribute it to a math teacher who changed my life. I just couldn\u2019t get it, and I kept asking him different ways to solve the same problem. He was kind enough and committed enough to explain and over-explain and explain until I got it. Because of him, I could set up those financial plans that have taken the school to today.\n\nThe school environment also helped. It was a process of self-discovery about what I could achieve. I started earning ranks \u2013 private first class, corporal, sergeant, and then staff sergeant.\n\nI was an F student when I arrived, and I became an Honor Roll student by the end of that year. And there were military contests in which they would give you like 15 orders \u2013like, \u201cMarch straight, and then turn left, and then go right, and then turn around, and go back.\u201d I won two years in a row. I was named as a person who stands at the front, right-hand side of the platoon, and takes the platoon to the objective. So, I set up my objective being that tall palm tree up on the hill, and then I lead because everybody will follow me.\n\nI finished the sixth grade and went into the seventh grade, and I went to the Colonel, and said, \u201cColonel, do you remember our meeting? Have I done well enough?\u201d\n\nHe says, \u201cYes.\u201d I got moved into the eighth grade, and three weeks later, there was a mid-term exam in algebra class. It was a multiple-choice exam in which I would do my calculations on the side. When I finished, I had seven equations not solved. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t leave this,\u201d so, I just kind of followed my intuition, filled them in; and got only 100 grades. After that, I knew that I was good at something.\n\nStill for four years, three times a year I planned economically and academically on losing the school. That really affected my perception of myself. I thought at the time that it was my fault. But I\u2019m very proud that I have, up to this point, kept my painting school operating. It\u2019s been very difficult. I\u2019ve had offers because I own the property. I don\u2019t earn a salary because it\u2019s a nonprofit organization and I don\u2019t work for the school, but I get offers to sell the property for a lot of money.\n\nMeg: I\u2019m sure.\n\nDealing with Bad Times Like an Accordian\n\nRudy: Sometimes when I have these types of meetings, I go to the school library and just sit there surrounded by the work of all the students, all the books. I got a request yesterday for information about a student who was here in the \u201850s: Walter Yarwood, Canadian. His group is very important in Canada for a style of painting that features very wide strokes, a lot of colors and a lot of texture. He is in the National Gallery of Canada. Many students who have come to the Instituto are in national galleries, either in the United States or in Canada. So, this is my life. Even though I\u2019m not here every day, the school is in my mind.\n\nMeg: Of course. It\u2019s part of your identity.\n\nRudy: It\u2019s part of my identity, and I have great plans. I see a revival of the school. I know how to deal with the bad times. I\u2019m like an accordion. When it stretches, it stretches. Since 2015, we have stabilized financially and kept the school open. We still have degree programs. We have a very small Bachelor of Visual Arts, with 36 students, and a very successful program like a continuing education program, run by a group of volunteers with professors who also are volunteers. So, we are doing well.\n\n\"I Think I Want to Learn\"\n\nIn 1984, the University of Guanajuato, which we are affiliated with, requested that all academic programs be reviewed and represented in the new educational plan for Mexico. I didn\u2019t have a clue. Through someone I knew, I met Humberto Chavez,.\n\nHe said, \u201cMr. Fernandez\u201d, \u201cWhat do you want? Do you want me to do the job, or do you want to learn?\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\"\n\nHe said, \u201cWell if I do the job, you will always depend on me or somebody like me. If you learn, you will have the background to make the necessary decisions.\u201d I said, \u201cI think I want to learn\u201d.\n\nChavez traveled between Mexico City and here. Before he arrived, I would think, \u201cOh, here he comes again\u201d. Then: \u201cOh, good, you\u2019re back.\u201d It was so difficult.\n\nHe often said, \"Do you want to do it or not? You\u2019re wasting your time\u201d.\n\nAnd I said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s hard, the entire academic lingo, all the developing of academic programs, and all of what is entailed in running the school.\u201d\n\nBut, in the end, I\u2019ve done everything. I started as head of the maintenance department and I became Executive Director of the school. I learned, and I\u2019m good at it.\n\nCheck out the art produced by current students by visiting Instituto Allende's Facebook page!\n\nBest Place To Stay in San Miguel de Allende\n\nWhen it comes to where to stay in San Miguel de Allende, there is a great variety of hotels and other accommodation options.

That translates to net migration of about 160,000 people from Mexico to the U.S., according to government data from both countries.\n\nIn the period from 2009 to 2014, by contrast, about a million people left the U.S. for Mexico while 870,000 Mexicans made the reverse trip, for net migration of about 130,000 people from the U.S. to Mexico. A similar trend from 2005 to 2010 resulted in effectively zero net migration between the two countries. (Due to the way the Mexican government sources report data, this analysis uses several overlapping time periods: 2005-2010, for example, and 2009-2014. In addition, migration from Mexico in this analysis includes only those who were born there, while migration to Mexico includes those born in Mexico, the U.S., and elsewhere.)\n\nHow we did this Measuring migration flows between Mexico and the U.S. is challenging because there are no official counts of how many Mexican immigrants enter and leave the U.S. each year. This analysis uses the best available government data from both countries to estimate the size of these flows. For this analysis, migration from the U.S. to Mexico includes persons born in Mexico, the U.S., and elsewhere, while migration from Mexico to the U.S. includes Mexican-born persons only. To estimate how many people have left the U.S. for Mexico, this analysis uses data from the 2018 and 2014 Mexican National Survey of Demographic Dynamics (or ENADID) and the 2020, 2010 and 2000 Mexican decennial censuses. Respondents are asked where they had been living five years prior to the date when the survey or census was taken. The answers to this question provide an estimate of the number of people who moved from the U.S. to Mexico during the five years prior to the survey date. A separate question focuses on those who have recently left Mexico. It asks whether anyone from the household had left for another country during the previous five years; if so, additional questions are asked about whether and when that person or people came back and their reasons for returning to Mexico. To estimate how many Mexicans left Mexico for the U.S., this analysis uses the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (2005-2019) and the Current Population Survey (1990-2019), which ask immigrants living in the U.S. about their country of birth and the year of their arrival in the U.S. Both sources are adjusted for undercount. Other sources of information include detailed tables released by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Immigration Statistics, the U.S. Department of State, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe main change in net flow between the two countries in the most recent period comes from the decreased return flow from the U.S. to Mexico \u2013 1.0 million from 2009 to 2014 down to 710,000 from 2013 to 2018 \u2013 rather than an increase in the number of Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. The number of Mexican immigrants going from Mexico to the U.S. stood unchanged at 870,000 for both 2009 to 2014 and 2013 to 2018.\n\nThere are several potential reasons for the changing patterns of migration flows between the two nations. In the U.S., job losses during the Great Recession of 2007-2009 in industries in which immigrants tend to be heavily represented may have pushed a large number of Mexicans to migrate back to Mexico, which in the aftermath of the recession also made the U.S. less attractive to potential Mexican migrants. In addition, stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration laws both at the southwest border and within the interior of the U.S. may have contributed to the reduction in Mexican immigrants coming to the U.S. in the years leading up to 2013.\n\nSome changing patterns in Mexico could also be behind the reduction in the number of immigrants coming to the U.S. since the Great Recession. First, growth in the working-age population of Mexicans has slowed due to a decades-long decline in the average number of births among women in Mexico. Lower fertility rates also mean smaller family sizes, which reduces the need for migration as a means of family financial support. Coupled with this, the Mexican economy over the past two decades has been more stable than in the 1980s and 1990s, when the country was hit with a number of profound economic crises.\n\nWhile net migration from Mexico to the U.S. turned positive from 2013 to 2018 for the first time in more than a decade, it remained far below the levels seen in earlier decades when migration from Mexico to the U.S. was at its peak. In the five-year period between 1995 and 2000, for example, nearly 3 million immigrants came to the U.S. from Mexico, while only around 670,000 made the reverse trip, for net migration of nearly 2.3 million people from Mexico to the U.S.\n\nMexico is the largest country of birth among the estimated 47 million immigrants living in the U.S., according to preliminary estimates based on the 2019 American Community Survey. About 24% of all U.S. immigrants were born in Mexico.\n\nTotal number of Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. declined between 2007 and 2019\n\nAfter peaking at 12.8 million in 2007, the number of Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. has declined in recent years. Preliminary estimates show that in 2019, the overall population of Mexican immigrants in the U.S. was 11.4 million, or about 1.4 million below the number at the onset of the Great Recession.\n\nThe decline in Mexican immigrants in the U.S. has been due mostly to a decrease of about 2 million unauthorized Mexican immigrants, from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007 to an estimated 4.9 million in 2017, according to Pew Research Center\u2019s latest estimate of the unauthorized population in the U.S.\n\nMexican immigrants have been at the center of one of the largest mass migrations in modern history. Between 1965 and 2015, more than 16 million Mexican immigrants migrated to the U.S. \u2013 more than from any other country.\n\nIn 1970, fewer than 1 million Mexican immigrants lived in the U.S. By 2000, that number had grown to 9.4 million, and by 2007 it peaked at 12.8 million.\n\nThe amount of Mexican migration during coronavirus outbreak remains unclear\n\nAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the U.S. and Mexican governments shut down their land borders to all non-essential travel, and the U.S. has yet to reopen them after more than a year. Travel in most of the world was disrupted during the pandemic and migration flows seemed to dwindle. However, it is still unclear how the coronavirus pandemic has affected migration flows from Mexico to the U.S. and vice versa. The two main sources for this kind of information, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s surveys and the Mexican government\u2019s INEGI data, are not yet available for the period covering the pandemic, while other data sources only offer a partial view. These secondary sources, however, do hint at some of the changes that might be underway since the coronavirus outbreak started.\n\nOne of these data points is the number of immigrants who entered the U.S. in fiscal 2020 through permanent legal residency, also known as a \u201cgreen card.\u201d In fiscal 2020, about 30,500 Mexican immigrants entered the U.S. this way, down 45% from the prior year. The reduction during the fiscal year, which ran from Oct. 1, 2019, to Sept. 30, 2020, was particularly notable in the months after the coronavirus outbreak began: Between April and September 2020, the number of Mexican green card recipients dropped by 90% compared with the same period in the prior year.\n\nAnother available data point is the number of Mexican immigrants who entered the U.S. through a temporary work visa, such as the H-2A visa for farmworkers, or the TN or H-1B visas for high-skilled immigrants. In fiscal 2020, Mexican farmworkers obtained about 198,000 temporary permits to come work in the U.S., up 5% from the prior fiscal year \u2013 an annual increase far lower than those seen in most years leading up to the pandemic. Meanwhile, the number of high-skilled Mexican workers who obtained a TN or H-1B visa dropped 36% in the same period, from about 24,000 to 15,000.\n\nAnother snapshot of Mexican immigration flows relates to unauthorized immigrants, including those who come to the U.S. temporarily on a visa and overstay their permit and those who cross the border without inspection and reside in the U.S. as unauthorized immigrants.\n\nWhile data on visa overstays during the pandemic is not available, the number of people traveling into the U.S. during the pandemic went down and the number of non-immigrant visas issued in Mexico also declined. In fiscal 2020, the total number of non-immigrant visas processed in Mexico by the U.S. Department of State dropped 35% compared with the prior year, from about 1.5 million in 2019 to about 960,000 in 2020. Most of these temporary visas were processed for tourism, business or for crossing the border and do not include a work authorization.\n\nBy contrast, apprehensions of unauthorized Mexican immigrants \u2013 a statistic that is often used as a proxy for measuring illegal immigration \u2013 increased considerably after the pandemic started in 2020, even as apprehensions of non-Mexicans dropped sharply. In fiscal 2020, the number of encounters or apprehensions of Mexican adults at the U.S.-Mexican border reached levels not seen since 2013. There were 253,118 such encounters, up 52% from 166,458 the year before.\n\nIt is important to note that apprehensions at the border were handled differently in fiscal 2020 than in years immediately prior due to an executive order called Title 42, authorized by former President Donald Trump. Under the order, Border Patrol agents did not always conduct a formal apprehension and removal, but instead sent immigrants directly back to Mexico without those steps.\n\nSome analysts say that the new procedures have increased the number of immigrants from Mexico and elsewhere who try to enter the U.S. illegally multiple times. The number of immigrants with a prior encounter with a Border Patrol agent increased considerably in fiscal year 2020, according U.S. Customs and Enforcement data."}, {"url": "https://news.yahoo.com/column-vicente-fern-ndezs-journey-203728293.html", "page_content": "In this Feb. 14, 2009, file photo, singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez performs at a free concert during Valentine's Day in Mexico City's Z\u00f3calo. (Clauido Cruz / Associated Press)\n\nThis fall has been a season of death for the people of my ancestral town of Jerez, Zacatecas.\n\nThe daughter of an Anaheim High classmate of mine passed away last month. A legendary East Los Angeles chorizero \u2014 a chorizo maker \u2014 lost his battle with cancer last week. The father of a dear family friend passed away just this Wednesday.\n\nThe deaths are weighing on my father, who now attends funerals and wakes the way he used to go to baptisms and quincea\u00f1eras. Jerezanos in Southern California easily number in the thousands, and Papi seems to know them all. He\u2019s 70 now, in the autumn of his life, a once-virile man now grayer, skinnier, slower and calmer.\n\nEver since the death of my mother two years ago from ovarian cancer, Papi has become existential as he tries to get his affairs in order for the day he, too, will leave us. So when I called him this morning to let him know about the death of Mexican music and movie icon Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, I didn't know what to expect.\n\nFernandez's death wasn\u2019t shocking. Millions of fans across the United States, Latin America and beyond have kept a vigil since August, when the man nicknamed Chente fell at his ranch in the Mexican state of Jalisco and injured his spine.\n\nIt\u2019s the end of an era, for sure. Fern\u00e1ndez bridged the gap between Mexico\u2019s original matinee idols and today\u2019s stars in a decades-long hit parade matched in American song only by Frank Sinatra. But that legacy wasn\u2019t on my dad\u2019s mind when I told him the news.\n\nHe was never the biggest fan \u2014 in our family, fellow zacatecano Antonio Aguilar was king. I can't really recall the last time Dad played his music. Yet my dad was subdued when I broke the news.\n\n\u201cHow sad,\u201d Papi slowly said. He stayed silent for a bit. When he spoke again, his voice quivered. \u201cQue en paz descanse,\u201d Papi said. May he rest in peace.\n\nPapi mourned for Fern\u00e1ndez \u2014 and also for himself and his generation of Mexican immigrants in the United States.\n\nThey saw Chente not just as an avatar for mexicanidad, as a swaggering macho with a mighty mustache and voice that could knock down the walls of Jericho. That's how my generation of Mexican Americans and those younger than me will remember Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nChente was more than caricature to our parents, especially our fathers and uncles \u2014 he was them every step of their life in the United States, where he ultimately became more popular than in Mexico.\n\nA minute after we hung up, Papi called me again (he always does that). Now, his tone was happier. He was suddenly 18 years old, a self-described mojado \u2014 a wetback \u2014 who had just arrived in East Los Angeles in 1969 to join his brothers in a new country. The soundtrack in all the bars along Olympic and Whittier boulevards back then? Chente.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d blast the volume on the radiola!\u201d my dad said with glee, rattling off the names of long-gone cantinas he haunted \u2014 El Hernandez, La India Bonita, Flamingo Inn \u2014 and Chente's big songs back then, \"Tu Camino y El M\u00edo\" and \"El Remedio.\" Papi laughed at the memory, then said, \u201cAnd we drunks would yell and throw back our cervezas and sing along.\u201d\n\nWhat particularly thrilled my dad and his friends was how Chente always shouted out his own village of Huentint\u00e1n, Jalisco. In a time and place where Americans and even Mexican Americans shunned Mexican immigrants, my dad and his peers felt seen, and their way of life validated.\n\nChente's triumphs became the triumphs of Dad and his generation as they found their own success. The singer went from performing at old movie palaces in downtown Los Angeles to arenas and stadiums across Southern California and beyond. My dad and his brothers went from sharing beds to buying their own suburban homes.\n\nThe star and his fans conquered el Norte by adhering to rancho libertarianism, a philosophy that celebrates bootstrap individualism in a way that makes Ayn Rand seem like a commune-dwelling hippie. His tunes documented the pain and pride he and his fans experienced through life. There were never any excuses offered for hardships \u2014 just pride in being able to beat them down.\n\nLatinos became the largest minority in the United States as Chente and my dad's generation became older. My generation went from hearing Chente as the forced soundtrack of our weekends \u2014 he remained on the radio even as we begged our parents to let us play Nirvana or 2Pac \u2014 to a nostalgia act. He, like our parents, moved on into the realm of myth, until no longer quite human but living relics.\n\nTheir style of mexicanidad is now in its winter. Machismo, the moral code that defined Mexican manhood for centuries, is no longer winked at or accepted. Immigrants from Zacatecas and Jalisco no longer dominate the social and cultural life of Southern California \u2014 it\u2019s now people from Sinaloa, Oaxaca, Mexico City. Chente's music is now largely ceremonial, not contemporary.\n\nAnd as those days end, the reexamination of them is in full effect. Right now on social media, critics are listing Chente\u2019s errors \u2014 his performance at the 2000 Republican National Convention, homophobic and sexist comments over the decades. Fern\u00e1ndez got in trouble as recently as this January, when a photo of him groping a female fan went viral online, a transgression for which the octogenarian apologized even as he tried to play it off as no big deal.\n\nNo one will miss those moments or the worldview that tolerated them. But those defects are also a reminder that the totality of someone's life should supersede their mistakes. Chente's life is a way to look at our parents as who they were and are \u2014 flawed people whose feats inspired us to try and match their heights instead of mimic their faults.\n\nThat\u2019s why the soundtrack in Southern California this Sunday is Chente and will be so for the next couple of days. Already, I've heard my middle-class Chicano neighbors, the ones whose Spanish is worse than mine, blast his music. The same with the taqueria near my wife\u2019s restaurant and the random cars that pass by.\n\nI'm playing Chente as well \u2014 to honor his legacy but also the elders in my community we\u2019ve lost in the past couple of weeks and will lose in the years to come. To mark the end of an era, and to think about what\u2019s next for us.\n\nI\u2019ll blast Chente and think about my father \u2014 an imperfect man who nevertheless has accomplished great things and now waits for his day to come. The song I'm playing on repeat is \"Paloma Errante\" (\"Wandering Dove\"), a 1970 track that topped the charts just after my dad came to East L.A.\n\n\"I raise my prayers to heaven / So that it calm my suffering,\" Chente crooned \u2014 almost wept. \"Eternal God, don't abandon me / Give me joy, and the future.\"\n\nQue descanse en paz, mi Chente.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-08-20/vicente-fernandez-radio-show-la-ranchera", "page_content": "Rub\u00e9n Miranda hosts \u201cEl Rancho de Vicente,\u201d a radio show dedicated to the music of ranchera icon Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez, which he has done for two decades.

Nearly every weekday for the last two decades, the Mexican immigrant has hosted a five-hour radio show on La Ranchera, which specializes in the Mexican version of oldies-but-goodies: corridos, boleros, norte\u00f1as, trios and duets but especially rancheras \u2014 ballads of love and the rural life that old and young Mexicans still sing and listen to on both sides of the border decades after their release.\n\nRanchera music legend Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez fell at his ranch in Huentint\u00e1n, Mexico on Aug. 8, injuring his cervical spine.

His taglines \u2014 \u201cRub\u00e9n Miranda, donde usted manda\u201d (\u201cRub\u00e9n Miranda, where you command\u201d) and \u201cMami, me voy a casa\u201d (\u201cMommy, I\u2019m going home\u201d) are classics of Los Angeles Spanish-language radio lingo.\n\nBut his bosses also task Miranda to host the one-hour \u201cEl Rancho de Vicente,\u201d a noontime show that\u2019s La Ranchera\u2019s most popular program and is wholly dedicated to the songs of Fern\u00e1ndez, which have served as part of the soundtrack of Mexican American life for nearly 50 years.\n\nThe show is so important to the station that Fern\u00e1ndez is part of their logo, a Mount Rushmore of ranchera that also includes matinee idol Pedro Infante and singer-songwriter Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez. It\u2019s splayed across Southern California billboards, bus benches, and posters.

Other stations mimicked the format to do their own programs dedicated to other Mexican musical legends like Chalino Sanchez, Los Bukis and Antonio Aguilar.\n\n\u201cWe Mexicans, when we fall in love with something, we don\u2019t let it go,\u201d said La Ranchera programming director Ernesto Morales, 48.

The Chihuahua native went on to became a television host in Guadalajara in 1972, when the forlorn \u201cVolver, Volver\u201d became Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s first smash.\n\n\u201cI remember walking through the city that year,\u201d Miranda said. \u201cEvery bar was playing that song. Chente was basically born an idol \u2014 God gave him a little kick of luck.\u201d\n\nHe moved to the United States in 1986 to work at Radio KALI, one of the earliest Spanish-language radio stations in Southern California, before helping to launch La Ranchera in 1998 as a host and programmer. Two years later, he was tasked with heading \u201cEl Rancho de Vicente\u201d after the station\u2019s bosses realized how popular Fern\u00e1ndez was in the United States.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s bigger here than in Mexico,\u201d said Pepe Garza, a longtime kingmaker in Southern California\u2019s Mexican regional music scene who\u2019s a creative executive for Estrella Media, the parent company of La Ranchera. He remembers moving to L.A. in 1998 and \u201cbeing surprised\u201d at this seeming anomaly. \u201cIn Mexico, he was a mythical personality but his music wasn\u2019t really played. Here, he was at the level of Pedro [Infante].\u201d\n\nFern\u00e1ndez\u2019s stateside popularity is easy to understand, said Morales. \u201cWell, the songs, of course. The voice. But when we play Chente, the older people remember life back in Mexico. And younger people remember when they were children and their parents played his music.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther artists are popular, but they just don\u2019t have that cachet,\u201d added Miranda. \u201cHe\u2019s urban and country, regal and down-to-earth like no one else. And people just put him on a pedestal like none other.\u201d\n\nMiranda had interviewed Fern\u00e1ndez a few times before the show\u2019s debut, when Chente showed up to La Ranchera\u2019s studios to offer a blessing. For an hour and a half, Fern\u00e1ndez regaled listeners with stories of his early days opening for Jim\u00e9nez at the Million Dollar Theater in downtown Los Angeles and took calls. And he expressed his gratitude to La Ranchera.\n\n\u201cIn Mexico, there\u2019s many radio shows dedicated to me, but this here program is a very important new event for me,\u201d he told Miranda.\n\nFern\u00e1ndez never again appeared on \u201cEl Rancho de Vicente.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s buena onda,\u201d Miranda said, using Mexican slang for \u201ccool.\u201d\n\nThe show has only gotten more Chente over the years. Morales originally played covers of Fern\u00e1ndez songs until listeners complained that \u201cthey weren\u2019t as good as how Chente sang them.\u201d Every Feb. 17, La Ranchera plays Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s canon all day. There are occasional giveaways \u2014 special collector CDs and DVDs, trips to Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s hacienda Los Tres Portillos as a lover\u2019s retreat \u2014 but Morales and Miranda don\u2019t plan to tinker with the program much more.\n\nOne thing that isn\u2019t in question is the show\u2019s future, regardless of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like the Beatles,\u201d Morales said as Miranda played \u201cAdi\u00f3s Mariquita Linda\u201d (Goodbye, Beautiful Mariquita\u201d), the last song of the hour for the day. \u201cChente is never going away.\u201d"}]}
