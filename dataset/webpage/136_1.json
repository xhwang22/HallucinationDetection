Good going forward, hard working and with good touch and distribution the teenager displayed all the raw ingredients to become a top quality full-back.\n\n\n\nInitially used from the bench, Caddis\u2019 was given a starting spot in the 3-2 Champions League defeat to Barcelona at Parkhead. Although he would be subbed that night the youngster did not look out of his depth in such illustrious company.\n\n\n\nWith Hinkel and Wilson already vying for the right-back berth Caddis may have to bide his time before he becomes a first team regular but the early signs are that he has the talent to ensure that even internationalists can\u2019t take a starting spot for granted.\n\n\n\nHe was a very good player but he just wasn\u2019t given sufficient opportunities to progress and many were sceptical that he would make it. Buying in was seen as better too often to taking a gamble on a youngster. Caddis may have been a good prospect but with Celtic messing up the league titles in 2008 & 2009 and then having multiple changes in managers, it doesn\u2019t help anyone\u2019s career let alone a developing youngster. Gordon Strachan in his last season & then Tony Mowbray were poor coaches during those spells.\n\nPaul Caddis was loaned out to Dundee United to gain first team experience in the January 2009 transfer window.\n\nHe returned to Celtic and featured in pre-season friendlies, this time under Neil Lennon. However, in Aug 2010 he made a transfer to Swindon after a successful \u00a3350,000 double bid for both himself and Simon Ferry. We hoped him the best.\n\nHe definitely had the making of a good player for Celtic, and some of the support were very much convinced that Celtic had missed out on a great player to be if the Club had held onto him and developed him.\n\n\n\nPost-Celtic\n\nA successful time at Swindon, he helped them to the league two title in England.\n\nHe then went onto have a long career with Birmingham over five seasons, and was a firm favourite. Made himself a hero by scoring a dramatic equaliser at the death in the last league match of Birmingham City\u2019s season in 2013/14 season to keep them up in their division.\n\nA proud moment came in 2016 when he finally made his debut for Scotland, a debut late in his career, albeit only playing a few minutes late on in the game after being subbed on in a 1-0 win over the Czech Republic in a friendly.\n\nIn 2017, Paul Caddis signed for Blackburn Rovers, coincidentally under Tony Mowbray his former Celtic manager. He later moved to Bradford and then most memorably returning to Swindon where he (again) helped the club win the league two title. He wrapped up his playing career in 2022 but had ended his time in the senior game on the playing side in 2021.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nQuotes\n\n\u201c14 years ago I was involved the last time Celtic won the title at tannadice. Tonight is another chance of doing that. Tommy Burns looked down on us that night like he will tonight.

And speaking on \u2018Under The Cosh,\u2019 Caddis revealed just how difficult yet extraordinary the experience was.\n\nREAD MORE: Lionel Messi's dad addresses rumours about PSG star's future after Saudi links\n\nHe said: \u201cI knew regardless of what I did, if I got abused, they [team and fans] would look after me for being a young lad. But if I did alright I had everything to gain so I was fine.\n\n\u201cTo play against them was a different level. The boss hammered me at half-time, sating \u2018can you not see those f****** balls being diag-d onto Ronaldhinho\u2019s toe?\u2019\n\n\u201cShunsuke Nakamura was brilliant going forward but gave me no help defensively so it was just [Eric] Abidal overlapping me for fun - I was all over the gaff. But what an experience.\n\n(Image: Daily Record)\n\n\u201cDirectly against Ronaldinho and all. Strongest a*** I have ever f****** felt. As soon as the ball came in, the first thing he done was bang [back into you]. By the time I\u2019d recovered from being winded the ball was miles away.\u201d\n\nYet the buzz of a dream home debut was quickly overshadowed by a scandal involving the Scotsman the following day in which a woman falsely accused him of fathering her unborn child.\n\nCaddis explained: \u201cI played on the Tuesday night but on the Wednesday morning I was in the front page and the back page in the same day. Some girl had come out and said I had fathered her child, which was a load of s***.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n(Image: Undr the Cosh)\n\n\u201cI was looking at the back page buzzing, saying \u2018look at that picture of me and Ronaldinho,\u2019 then looking at the back page seeing a munter in the front saying I was\u2026\n\n\u201c[The paper] had the story ready for about six weeks.

And he clearly did enough during the spell as the move was made permanent at the end of the campaign.\n\nSince then, the utility player has made enough of an impression to make over 100 Championship appearances for the Blues, and his consistency helped him move into Gordon Strachan\u2019s thoughts, who handed him his international debut during Scotland\u2019s friendly with Czech Republic last week.\n\nWhile he may have often doubted whether he made the right decision leaving Celtic Park, the fact that he has found regular first-team football elsewhere and has been given a chance for the national team would arguably vindicate his decision to part with his boyhood club."}, {"url": "https://gossipgist.com/paul-caddis", "page_content": "Paul McLean Caddis is a Scottish professional football player who plays for League One club Swindon Town as a right-back or midfielder.

Refreshed and on form after a loan spell at Dundee United the youngster was excited at the prospect of working with new Hoops boss Tony Mowbray.\n\nHe'd heard all about Mogga's philosophies based on free-flowing attacking football and flying full-backs.\n\nCaddis was all set to fight it out with German star Andy Hinkel for the right-back slot at Parkhead - and win.\n\nInstead the campaign has turned into a nightmare for the Scotland Under-21 captain who is now third choice at Celtic Mark Wilson. And because Mowbray has offered him little encouragement and even less game time Paul has accepted his days are numbered.\n\nThat's why he'll look to sign a Bosman deal elsewhere in January - if someone can stump up the cash Hoops supremo Peter Lawwell is looking for in compensation.\n\nCaddis, 21, hopes Lawwell does not price him out of a move and force him to stay until he turns 23 and is free to go for nothing.\n\nIn a frank interview Paul revealed to MailSport his frustration at not making the breakthrough under Mowbray. He said: \"It has been so disappointing. I'm still just trying to get a game.\n\n\"When I have played I've been everywhere on the pitch apart from in goals or at centre-back.\n\n\"It's especially disappointing after a good spell at Tannadice and the fact the manager came in with a reputation of having a philosophy for playing football.

He has not said too much.\n\n\"The Europa League tie against Rapid Vienna was especially disappointing. I thought I might get my chance but he went with Wilson.\n\n\"I felt that was me going back a place again. They are now both in front of me.\n\n\"When I have played I've felt I've done well so that has added to the frustration.\n\n\"I've never had a run - I've never started an SPL game at Celtic and that's hard to take.\"\n\nCaddis says fans constantly tell him he deserves more of a chance to shine in Mowbray's first team but that's scant consolation for lack of action on the pitch.\n\nHe has already contemplated life after Parkhead but is worried clubs won't take a gamble because he's not experienced enough - they won't be able to fork out the hefty compensation Celtic will ask for.\n\nPaul said: \"Punters come up to me outside the stadium asking why I'm not playing which is nice.\n\n\"It's good to hear the fans say that but they don't pick the team.\n\n\"My contract's up at the end of the season so I might have to look elsewhere to try to get a game and kick start my career.\n\n\"But will someone take a chance on a 21-year-old who has hardly played any football? \"However, there is life after Celtic.

He has played for both Celtic and Swindon Town in all positions apart from striker and goalkeeper.\n\nCaddis started his career with Scottish Premier League club Celtic. He broke into the first team during the 2007\u201308 season, but never managed to hold down a starting place over the next few years. He spent the second half of the 2008\u201309 season on loan to Dundee United. Caddis was sold to English League One club Swindon Town in August 2010. He spent the 2012\u201313 season on loan to Birmingham City, and joined the club on a permanent contract in September 2013. After three-and-a-half seasons in his second spell with Birmingham, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent in January 2017.\n\nCaddis played regularly for the Scotland under-21 team and also captained the side. He made his senior debut in 2016.\n\nEarly life\n\nCaddis attended St Joseph's Academy.\n\nClub career\n\nCeltic\n\nCaddis trained with the under-17s team at Celtic before moving to the under 19s, where he quickly became captain. He often trained with the Celtic first team. He made his competitive debut coming on as a substitute in Celtic's 1\u20130 victory away to Falkirk on 27 January 2008. He then made his first start just six days later against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park in the Scottish Cup. He assisted Scott McDonald for the first goal in the 5\u20131 victory. Caddis made his home debut on 20 February against Barcelona in the Champions League last 16 first leg fixture. He went on to play 17 times in the Scottish Premier League for Celtic.\n\nCaddis appeared in Celtic's 3\u20133 Europa League draw with Rapid Vienna in December 2009.\n\nDundee United (loan)\n\nOn 2 February 2009, Caddis joined Dundee United on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut against Inverness CT on 14 February playing the full 90 minutes on the right wing as the game ended 1\u20131. He returned to Celtic after playing his last game for the Tangerines in a 3\u20130 defeat to Rangers on 24 May, having made 11 appearances for the club.\n\nSwindon Town\n\nIn August 2010, Caddis and fellow Celtic youth team graduate Simon Ferry joined English League One club Swindon Town for an undisclosed fee. The 22-year-old, who said he left Celtic for regular first-team football, signed a three-year contract. Manager Danny Wilson commented favourably on his versatility, and played him in midfield as well as at full back. He made his debut in the Football League Cup against Leyton Orient, and made 42 appearances during the 2010\u201311 season as Swindon were relegated to League Two.\n\nCaddis remained at Swindon for the 2011\u201312 season in League Two despite a number of players leaving the club after the relegation. Swindon began the season with new addition Oliver Risser as captain, but Caddis took the armband after Risser suffered an injury. Despite Risser's return to fitness, manager Paolo di Canio decided to name Caddis as captain for the remainder of the season. He was ever-present for most of the season, missing a handful of games in March and April \u2013 including the Football League Trophy final defeat \u2013 due to an ankle injury. He and Matt Ritchie were named in the League Two PFA Team of the Year as Swindon were promoted as champions. At the end of the season, he agreed an extension to his contract until 2014.\n\nBirmingham City\n\nOn the last day of the August 2012 transfer window, Caddis joined Championship club Birmingham City on loan for the season. Birmingham striker Adam Rooney moved in the other direction, on loan for the season with a view to a permanent transfer. He produced a man-of-the-match performance on his debut the following day, in Birmingham's first league win of the season at home to Peterborough United. A dislocated shoulder sustained during his third game kept him out until late November.\n\nIn April 2013, BBC Sport reported that Birmingham's offer of \u00a3125,000 down and a further \u00a3125,000 in instalments had been rejected by Swindon because they were looking for around \u00a3275,000 cash. When Birmingham right-back Neal Eardley injured a knee just before the end of the summer transfer window, the club made a further bid for Caddis, who had remained out of favour at Swindon. The bid, reportedly in the region of \u00a3150,000 was accepted, and Caddis signed a three-year contract with Birmingham on 2 September. He became a regular in the side, and scored his first goals for Birmingham on 30 November in the first half of the league match at Barnsley, with a 25-yard (23 m) drive and a penalty. On the last day of the season, Birmingham needed at least a draw away at Bolton Wanderers and for other results to favour them to avoid relegation to League One. Two goals down with 12 minutes left, Nikola \u017digi\u0107 scored, and three minutes into stoppage time, his close-range header was cleared off the line to Caddis, who produced what he thought was his first ever headed goal to preserve Birmingham's second-tier status.\n\nCaddis missed only one match in all competitions in 2014\u201315 \u2013 his 48 appearances were more than any of his teammates \u2013 he was the regular penalty-taker, and he captained the team when Paul Robinson was unavailable. The Birmingham Mail rated him one of the best attacking full backs in the division, praising his \"delivery, support play and ability with a dead ball\", and suggested that his assertiveness in defence was starting to improve. In 2015\u201316, Caddis lost the team captaincy to Michael Morrison, and was not an automatic selection at right back, but he still started 37 of the 46 league matches. At the start of the 2016\u201317 season, manager Gary Rowett told Caddis he would not be involved with the first team until his fitness levels were good enough \u2013 an assessment with which the player disagreed. He played with the development squad to prove his fitness, but dislocated a shoulder while doing so, underwent surgery, and was out for three months. In January 2017, new manager Gianfranco Zola told Caddis he rated him behind Jonathan Spector and the youngster Josh Dacres-Cogley, but that if he wanted to stay at Birmingham and fight for his place it was his decision. On 26 January, his contract was cancelled by mutual consent.\n\nBury\n\nCaddis signed a short-term contract with EFL League One club Bury on 25 February 2017. He went straight into the starting eleven for that day's 1\u20130 win away to Charlton Athletic, a result that continued a winning streak for Lee Clark, under whose management Caddis had been a first-team regular at Birmingham.\n\nInternational career\n\nCaddis with Scotland under-21 side in 2009\n\nCaddis played for the Scotland under-19 team and won 13 caps for the Scotland under-21s.\n\nIn March 2013, he was called into the senior squad as a late replacement to cover for the injured Russell Martin for the World Cup qualifier away to Serbia, but remained an unused substitute.\n\nCaddis was next called up for a friendly against the Czech Republic on 24 March 2016, again as a late replacement. This time, he made his senior debut as an 88th-minute substitute for goalscorer Ikechi Anya as Scotland completed a 1\u20130 win.\n\nPersonal life\n\nCaddis is the younger brother of former Ayr United striker Ryan Caddis and older brother of former Alloa Athletic midfielder Liam Caddis and former Kilmarnock goalkeeper, Dylan. As of July 2016, all of his brothers were playing together at Scottish junior club Ardrossan Winton Rovers.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition Club Season League National Cup League Cup Other Total Division Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Celtic 2006\u201307 Scottish Premier League 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2007\u201308 Scottish Premier League 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 4 0 2008\u201309 Scottish Premier League 5 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 7 0 2009\u201310 Scottish Premier League 10 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 13 0 Total 17 0 3 0 2 0 2 0 24 0 Dundee United (loan) 2008\u201309 Scottish Premier League 11 0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 11 0 Swindon Town 2010\u201311 League One 38 1 2 0 1 0 1 0 42 1 2011\u201312 League Two 39 4 4 0 2 0 5 1 50 5 2012\u201313 League One 0 0 \u2014 0 0 \u2014 0 0 Total 77 5 6 0 3 0 6 1 92 6 Birmingham City (loan) 2012\u201313 Championship 27 0 1 0 0 0 \u2014 28 0 Birmingham City 2013\u201314 Championship 38 5 2 0 2 0 \u2014 42 5 2014\u201315 Championship 45 6 1 0 2 1 \u2014 48 7 2015\u201316 Championship 39 4 0 0 1 0 \u2014 40 4 2016\u201317 Championship 0 0 0 0 1 0 \u2014 1 0 Total 149 15 4 0 6 1 \u2014 159 16 Bury 2016\u201317 League One 9 0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 9 0 Career total 263 20 13 0 11 1 8 1 295 22\n\nHonours\n\nClub\n\nSwindon Town\n\nFootball League Two: 2011\u201312\n\nIndividual"}, {"url": "https://fanbanter.co.uk/hereford-appoint-ex-swindon-birmingham-bury-blackburn-bradford-player-as-manager/", "page_content": "Hereford appoint ex-Swindon, Birmingham, Bury, Blackburn, Bradford, Swindon player Paul Caddis for what will be his first spell as manager.\n\nCaddis is currently an academy coach with Fleetwood Town, but now it seems he\u2019s ready to step into management with the National League North his next destination come the 2023/24 season.\n\nHereford currently sit 15th in the table with 54 points from 44 games played, seven points above the drop zone and 11 points below the playoffs.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the appointment of Paul Caddis as the Bulls\u2019 First Team Manager. Caddis will officially take charge from the 1st of May. \u26aa\ufe0f\u26ab\ufe0f#COYW | #StrengthInNumbers \u2014 HerefordFC (@HerefordFC) April 20, 2023\n\nCLUB STATEMENT:\n\nWe are delighted to announce the appointment of Paul Caddis as our new first team manager. Caddis will officially take charge from 1st May 2023.\n\nAlthough new to management, Caddis brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to his new role after a successful playing career that spanned over 15 years, in which time he made over 400 senior appearances in the game.\n\nA former Scottish international, Caddis started his professional career at Celtic FC, making his home debut in a final 16 round Champions League fixture against Barcelona.\n\nCaddis went on to play for clubs in England, including Swindon Town, Birmingham City, and Blackburn Rovers. He has also played for Bury and Dundee.\n\nHaving retired from professional football in 2021, Caddis has been making a name for himself as a coach and has been involved in coaching roles at various clubs, including Swindon Town and most recently, Fleetwood Town, where he\u2019s been working in the Academy set up, and in coaching Fleetwood Town\u2019s International side (FTIFA).\n\nSpeaking following his appointment, Caddis said: \u201cI am thrilled to step into the role of manager. It\u2019s an exciting opportunity for me, and I am committed to leaving no stone unturned in order to achieve the success and progression that this club deserves.\n\n\u201cI will work tirelessly and around the clock to build a team that the Hereford supporters and wider community can be truly proud of. Our team will embody character, desire, and a strong work ethic that mirrors the passion of our fantastic supporters.\u201d\n\nBulls\u2019 Chairman, Chris Ammonds, said:\n\n\u201cI am hugely excited by this appointment. Paul\u2019s obvious hunger for an opportunity and vision for our club impressed at both stages of the interview process. His enthusiasm and ambition shone through in his interviews and the desire to learn and improve he demonstrated was infectious. He has been chomping at the bit to be given a chance at the right club.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he was made captain of many of the teams he featured in during his impressive playing career shows his leadership qualities and it\u2019s clear he demands high standards of everyone around him. He wants to build a team that plays football on the front foot and has emphasised the point that he will expect his players to be the fittest in the league.\n\n\u201cHe has been building his coaching experience over the past few years and explained in detail that we are exactly the type of chance he has been looking for. I am very pleased that we are able to give him this opportunity and I am really looking forward to seeing him develop at Edgar Street.\n\n\u201cFinally, I would like to say that I believe we are indebted to Yan, his coaching staff and the players for their effort and commitment over the past few months. Yan very much remains in post as first team manager until the end of the season so let\u2019s hope we can build on last weekend\u2019s excellent win at Peterborough and end the season with a flourish.\u201d\n\nPaul Caddis has played more than 350 matches professionally at club level, while also represented his country in youth and senior competitions.\n\nDue to his versatility, he could play anywhere in the midfield. He played in every position for Celtic and Swindon Town, except striker and goalkeeper.\n\nCaddis began his professional career at Celtic. Caddis broke into the first-team during the 2007/08 season but was never able to maintain a place in the starting lineup over the following years.\n\nDundee United took him on loan for the second half the 2008-09 campaign before being sold to English League One club Swindon Town, in August 2010.\n\nIn 2012-13, Caddis spent the season on loan at Birmingham City, and then joined the club permanently in September 2013 and scored the goal in stoppage time that prevented the team from being relegated from the Championship.\n\nIn January 2017, his contract with Birmingham was mutually terminated after three-and a half seasons.\n\nAfter a short stint with Bury in League One, he spent a year with Blackburn Rovers before spending seven months at Bradford City.\n\nHe returned to Swindon Town after a short spell with Bury in League One, played his final match in 2021 and announced his retirement one year later.\n\nCaddis captained Scotland\u2019s under-21 team, and played for them regularly. In 2016, he made his debut as a full-time international for Scotland.\n\nThis is what fans said as Hereford appoint the ex-Swindon, Birmingham, Bury, Blackburn, Bradford player as their new manager\u2026\n\n@BrummieHayden: Blues legend.
