He studied art in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg), but from 1917 to 1919 his schooling was interrupted by military service in the Russian army. Yunkers soon left Russia for Europe and traveled extensively for the next two decades, settling for long periods in Cuba, France, and Germany. During much of his early career, Yunkers was active in political as well as artistic movements. At times his political investments even outweighed his commitment to his art, and in 1936 he moved to Spain to fight in its civil war. When the war ended in 1939, he moved to Stockholm and began to focus on art making again. He became associated with the Swedish Surrealists and published three journals devoted to art and politics. These handcrafted publications signaled a strong interest in printmaking, and in the 1940s he made many woodblock prints depicting distorted objects and figural compositions that demonstrate the influence of German Expressionism on his work. In 1947, Yunkers moved to New York and began to teach at the New School for Social Research. After four tumultuous marriages, he married one of his former students from the New School, Dore Ashton, in 1952. Ashton became an art critic for the New York Times in 1955, and through her, Yunkers was introduced to the artists who would become known as the Abstract Expressionists. He began drawing with pastel directly on canvas, resulting in large-scale works that recall Color Field painting in their emphasis on the materiality of color. Expanding on this impulse, Yunkers's later work made extensive use of negative space, collage, and monochrome. The influence of Minimalism in this more reduced aesthetic is clear, and his canvases became more object-like. Both printmaking and bookmaking were central to Yunkers's oeuvre. He founded the Rio Grande Workshop in New Mexico (where he also taught) in 1949, publishing an entirely handmade art magazine called Prints in the Desert. In 1969 he illustrated a limited-edition book by the poet Octavio Paz, a collaboration that sparked both a friendship and a number of additional illustrated books in the years to come. Yunkers also produced two large public works on commission: A Human Condition (1966), a mural for Syracuse University, and a tapestry produced for Stony Brook University (1968), both in New York. Yunkers had his first solo exhibition in 1921 at the Maria Kunde Galerie, Hamburg, Germany. Later that same year, he was part of a group show featuring Eastern European and Russian artists, including Alexander Archipenko, Marc Chagall, and Vasily Kandinsky, held in Hannover, Germany. He was included in an exhibition organized by the Print Council of America entitled American Prints Today. A snapshot of the state of American printmaking at the time of the exhibition.

He began drawing at an early age, from imagination and by studying the illustrations in books from his parents\u2019 collection. He left home at age 14 to pursue a career in visual art, enrolling in what he later identified as the Imperial Academy of Arts in Petrograd (now St. Petersburg), but what may have been the Drawing School of the Society for the Enrichment of the Arts. The Drawing School kept no records, and later Yunkers would fabricate his credentials when he emigrated to the United States. In1919 he moved to Germany, where he had his first solo exhibition in 1921 at the Maria Kunde Galerie in Hamburg; with his earnings from the show he rented a studio. He became familiar with members of the Sturmgruppe, including Nolde, Schmidt, and Rottluff. He later participated in a large Russian avant-garde exhibition with Kandinksy, Archipenko, and Chagall.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe began to travel in 1923, going to Spain, the Canary Islands, Paris, and eventually Cuba in 1926, where he changed his name from \u201cJunkers\u201d to \u201cYunkers\u201d. He lived there until 1927, when, with the rise in political upheaval and the persecution of Leftists, he fled Cuba for Mexico, where he met Diego Rivera. By the end of 1927 he had returned to Europe. He went briefly to Berlin, but the gaining power of the Nazi party spurred his move to Paris. He continued to work on various larger projects, murals for the City Hall in Ivry, and his woodcut series \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d. In 1934 he immigrated to Sweden, where his reputation as a political artist and printmaker preceded him, and he was received with much enthusiasm. He remained in Sweden, while focusing primarily on printmaking, for the next 16 years. While living in Sweden he began to exhibit widely, quickly becoming recognized for his graphic work. His extensive collaborative work for various art publications kept him at the forefront of the European art world, and, despite a 1947 Stockholm studio fire that destroyed nearly ten years of work, he was able to continue to show that year. That summer, he moved to New York and began teaching at the New School for Social Research. His notoriety grew steadily, and his work was quickly acquired by several museums and private collections. He exhibited throughout the nation and abroad, and in 1953 he became a U.S. citizen. He founded the Rio Grande Workshop in Albuquerque, New Mexico (where he also taught) in 1949, publishing an entirely handmade art magazine called Prints in the Desert.\n\n\n\n\n\nYunkers was tireless in his creativity. While continuing to explore techniques and styles in printmaking (in 1960 he began learning lithography at Tamarind Workshop in New Mexico) as well as pastel drawing and painting, he took up teaching positions at the University of California, Berkeley, and Barnard College. He was invited to be a visiting lecturer at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, and Columbia University. His work is included in private and public collections and museums, including the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris; Brooklyn Museum, New york; Corcoran Gallery, Washington D.C.; Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, California; Hamburg Kunsthalle, Germany; Rijksmuseum, Amsterdm; Smithsonian American Art Museum; Victoria and Albert Museum, England; and others.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/adja.yunkers/1108438", "page_content": "Adja Yunkers\n\nartist painter printmaker\n\nJuly 15, 1900 (age 83) Riga, Latvia\n\nAdja Yunkers began his career from the military service at the Russian Army beginning at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1917.

He then moved to Mexico where he met Diego Rivera. At the end of 1927, Yunkers came back to Europe settling down in Paris. While in the capital of France, the artist worked on multiple artistic projects, like murals for the City Hall in Ivry or his woodcut series \u201cThe Ten Commandments\u201d.

While in the country, he published and edited the periodicals on art and politics called Creation, Arts and Art portfolio. Since then, Yunkers devote much of his time to printmaking and soon became recognized for his graphic work. During the 1940s, he produced a great number of woodblock prints showing deformed objects and figures similar to German Expressionism in style.

His popularity continued to grow and soon his artworks were acquired by several public and private collections. Two years after his arriving in America, Adja Yunkers formed the Rio Grande Workshop in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which issued a handmade art magazine titled \u2018Prints in the Desert\u2019. In 1960, Yunkers produced his first lithographs including two series called \u2018Salt\u2019 of five lithographs and \u2018Skies of Venice\u2019 of ten lithographs at the Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles. At the end of the decade, the artist worked on two commissioned projects, a mural for Syracuse University called a \u2018Human Condition\u2019 (1966) and a tapestry for Stony Brook University (1968). The same time, he collaborated with the poet Octavio Paz illustrating his book. Octavio became Yunkers\u2019s and the following years, the artist illustrated many of his other writings. Adja Yunkers exhibited a lot in the United States and in Europe, having the retrospectives at the Baltimore Museum of Art (1960), at the Brooklyn Museum (1967), at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, Salt Lake City (1968), at the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City, Mexico (1975) and at the Fine Arts Museum of Long Island in Hempstead, New York (1983).
