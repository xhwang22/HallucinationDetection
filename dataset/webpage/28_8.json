{"He left Middlesbrough in October 2013.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/57011205", "page_content": "Steve McClaren's European exploits with Middlesbrough were a key factor in his appointment as England manager\n\n\"The greatest night in the history of football,\" screamed the late Alastair Brownlee, legendary radio commentator and \"Voice of the Boro\".\n\nMiddlesbrough had done it the hard way, but they'd beaten Steaua Bucharest in the semi-final of the Uefa Cup.\n\nOnly 20 years earlier, the club had been saved from liquidation by chairman Steve Gibson. Now, they were on the cusp of European glory.\n\nOn 10 May, 2006 - exactly 15 years ago - Boro headed for Eindhoven's Philips Stadion, where Sevilla lay in wait in the final of the competition that subsequently became the Europa League.\n\nWhatever happened, two years on from lifting the Carling Cup, Boro's only silverware in their 128-year history up until that point, manager Steve McClaren and his players had already left their mark.\n\nTheir story was a remarkable one; two cup final defeats in 1997 were followed by relegation from the Premier League, but this time, Boro were looking up.\n\nEuropean football hadn't even been on their minds before, but it was a chance to put the town of Middlesbrough on the map.\n\n\"One of the reasons we went to Middlesbrough was they'd always been a cup team,\" McClaren, who left his role as Sir Alex Ferguson's assistant at Manchester United and headed for Teesside in 2001, tells BBC Sport.\n\n\"In 2004, we won the cup, and Europe was a by-product of that. Reaching Europe wasn't the goal, the goal was to win a cup. We didn't sit there after beating Bolton Wanderers and think: 'Oh, great, we're in Europe'. It was all about the trophy.\n\n\"Then we wanted to compete; as they say, Boro were 'a small town in Europe'. We had to build the squad; we had to reassess.\"\n\nThe final would be the culmination of a two-season journey in the Uefa Cup; the result of all of McClaren's hard work. In 2004-05, Boro balanced a seventh-placed Premier League finish with reaching the last 16, but surpassed that in stunning fashion a year later, beating Roma, FC Basel and Steaua to set up a meeting with Sevilla.\n\n'The football gods had written it in the stars'\n\nOne historic comeback en route would have been enough to immortalise that team, let alone two.\n\nAgainst Basel in the quarter-final, an early goal in the second leg at the Riverside Stadium meant Boro needed four to progress.\n\nAmazingly, Massimo Maccarone scored in the 90th minute to complete the job, after a brace from Mark Viduka and a Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink strike.\n\nBrownlee, from high up in the gantry, called it the \"greatest comeback since Lazarus\".\n\nExactly three weeks later, it would be surpassed. Boro were back at home and chasing again. After a 1-0 defeat in Bucharest, two goals for Steaua gave Boro an identical task.\n\nSomehow, they rallied once more, with Maccarone, their super sub, at the heart of the drive. He scored first, before second-half goals from Viduka and Chris Riggott, and made himself the hero again in the penultimate minute of normal time.\n\n\"It was a strange arrangement for the semi-final,\" Dave Allan, head of media and communications at the time, says. \"We'd been told by Uefa that if we qualified, there was a meeting in Eindhoven the following day.\n\n\"The game wasn't going to finish until 9.45pm. We'd packed our bags ready to go, and we had to catch a 6:30am flight from Teesside to Amsterdam. We qualified, and we didn't even leave the stadium until well after midnight.\n\n\"When we were 3-0 down on aggregate, I remember texting my wife saying: 'It's all over, at least I don't have to get up early in the morning. There's no coming back from 3-0 down again!'\"\n\nThings looked bleak when Boro captain Gareth Southgate was forced off with an injury, and it was McClaren's assistant Steve Round who implored him to put Maccarone on. He scored just seven minutes later.\n\n\"Steve's advice was to put Maccarone on the right-hand side, Stewart Downing at left-back and Yakubu at left wing. We had an unbelievable front line of Maccarone, Viduka, Hasselbaink and Yakubu and full-backs of Downing and (Stuart) Parnaby. We went for it, it was gung-ho and fortune favoured the brave.\n\n\"I always say that lightning never strikes twice in one place. There it did; the football gods had written it in the stars, it was not for one night, but two. It was an incredible night, full of drama.\"\n\n'We just had momentum'\n\nMiddlesbrough's fans travelled in huge numbers to Eindhoven for the final\n\nDowning, who was just 21 at the time, set up all four goals on the night. Only now does he look back and realise the level of their achievement.\n\n\"I just thought it was the norm, but now you think how unbelievable it was to do what we did, as a so-called unfashionable club, not one of the big ones,\" he says. \"We just had momentum, that was the big word; we deserved to be there and we were full of confidence.\n\n\"We had lads in the box like Jimmy and Viduka who thrived off service. That is how we got through a lot of games. Maybe teams just thought: 'It's only Middlesbrough, we'll beat them'. But it was definitely something we worked on, we always had at least two strikers on the pitch. If you watch my cross for Massimo's goal, I don't even look, I just put it in the area. I knew he'd score.\"\n\nIt was Viduka who galvanised the team at half time, with a rousing speech that made McClaren's job much easier. But Boro had all the motivation they needed heading into the Steaua game, having lost in the FA Cup semi-final to West Ham United only days earlier.\n\n\"I remember being on the bus home from Villa Park and it was flat,\" Downing continues. \"We had the return leg against Steaua coming up, and it was like: \"Oh, god!\" Then four days later, we are on a massive high. It was mental football.\"\n\n'It was one match too far'\n\nMassimo Maccarone led a nomadic existence before and after his time at Middlesbrough, with his club career taking in a total of 12 teams, six loans and even a spell in Australia\n\nIt was a season of highs, including home victories over Manchester United, Arsenal and champions Chelsea. Yet, one dark afternoon in February stands out as a key moment for McClaren, who had a season ticket thrown at him by an angry fan as a Luke Moore hat-trick inspired Aston Villa to a 4-0 victory at the Riverside.\n\n\"We'd put all our eggs in two baskets, and the league was suffering because of that,\" he admits. \"I had to wait to escape out of the back door of the stadium after the game; everyone was calling for my head. I had one of the best chairmen in Steve Gibson, but I thought he was going to sack me. That night, he took me upstairs and I thought: 'Oh, this is it.' I got up to his office and there was a pint laid out for me. He just said: 'Get that down you!'\n\n\"A week later, we beat Chelsea 3-0.\"\n\nSpeculation was rife that McClaren would be replacing Sven-Goran Eriksson as England manager by the spring. Allan believes that didn't help Boro's cause, but McClaren says it was put to bed well before the final.\n\n\"I thought his ambition was too much,\" Allan says. \"I'd always give him a briefing before a press conference. We went through his notes and he says: 'All these questions are about England, not about the match.' I said: 'There aren't going to be any questions about the match. The story is 'Is Steve McClaren the new England manager?' He says: 'That is a bit off, isn't it?' I said it was fair enough, and just as I was about to leave the room, I turned and asked: 'You're not going to take it, are you Steve?' He said: 'You don't turn down the England job, Dave.'\"\n\n\"Everything was decided before [the final],\" McClaren recalls. \"There were more things that could have sidelined us during both semi-finals. After that we were focused and I could put England to one side. We prepared like mad for Sevilla.\"\n\nThe final proved too much in the end. Sevilla won 4-0, thanks to goals from Luis Fabiano and Freddie Kanoute, which sandwiched an Enzo Maresca brace. Three goals were scored in the final 12 minutes.\n\n\"It was one match too far,\" McClaren adds. \"We'd had a backlog of fixtures; we had to play Fulham and Everton and we were on our last legs. Maybe if the FA Cup run hadn't happened, we'd have had the energy for the final. Sevilla were head and shoulders above anyone in that competition. We took risks like before, but we got punished.\"\n\n\"We turned up and we had the belief to beat them,\" says Downing. \"Ten or 15 minutes in, you think: 'Wow, nobody has done this to us before.' The speed of their play was something else; I had Jesus Navas and Dani Alves down my side. The combinations they were playing were incredible. We couldn't get the ball into areas to hurt them; Alves just played so high and had so much possession. I think we'd reached our level; we had a go late on again, got the strikers on, but they picked us apart.\"\n\nSouthgate retired and replaced McClaren as manager that summer, but Boro were never able to build on the foundations he left. After finishing 14th in the league that season, they reached 12th and 13th before relegation in 2009. They have only been back to the top flight once in 11 years.\n\nBut the likes of Downing, who left and then returned before leaving again for Blackburn Rovers, and McClaren, a resident of the area even today, will always be fondly remembered for making Middlesbrough a small town in Europe."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/24617321", "page_content": "Last updated on .From the section Football\n\nMiddlesbrough manager Tony Mowbray has departed the Championship club after three years at the Riverside.\n\nThe 49-year-old's assistant, Mark Venus, will take temporary charge for Friday's league game against Doncaster.\n\nBoro's woeful 2013 In the Championship: Played: 33\n\nWon: 5\n\nDrawn: 9\n\nLost: 19\n\nMiddlesbrough said they \"would like to place on record their sincere thanks to Tony Mowbray for all of his substantial efforts, dedication and integrity\".\n\nBoro have won only one of their last 10 league games and Saturday's defeat at Barnsley leaves them 16th in the table.\n\nTheir solitary win in the last 10 was a 4-1 home victory over bottom club Yeovil and Middlesbrough lie only four points above the relegation zone, and 10 points away from the play-offs.\n\nThey went out of the Capital One Cup in the first round in August after a 2-1 home defeat by League Two side Accrington Stanley.\n\nMowbray started his playing career with Boro in 1982 and was named captain aged 23.\n\nHe led them back to the top flight in 1988 via consecutive promotions and in total amassed 348 league appearances in a nine-year spell.\n\nHe retired as a player in 2000 and, after stints managing Hibernian, West Bromwich Albion and Celtic, returned to Teesside almost three years ago.\n\nIn his first full season he led the club to seventh in the Championship and last term they were well placed for a promotion push before a dramatic loss of form meant they finished in 16th place."}, {"url": "https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/players-who-joined-left-middlesbrough-17064724", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest Boro stories straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter\n\nIt's 10 years next week since Gareth Southgate was sacked at Boro.\n\nThe summer of 2009 saw several high profile departures, to be expected, of course, after relegation.\n\nAnd Boro set about rebuilding for the Championship with the arrival of some lesser-known players.\n\nIn a summer of change, who joined and who left? And what happened next for those players?\n\nThose who arrived\n\nMark Yeates\n\nMark Yeates was the first player to arrive at Boro in the summer of 2009 as Gareth Southgate set about putting together a new-look squad for the Championship.\n\nThe gaffer was delighted to land a player who he insisted would have been a target even if Boro had stayed up the season earlier.\n\n\u201cMark will be very versatile for us,\" he said.\n\n\u201cHe is right-footed but he can play either side or behind the attackers.\n\n\u201cNobody should jump to conclusions about where he\u2019ll be playing.\n\n\u201cHe also has a great dead ball delivery which will be important for us.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been watching games throughout the league and we had been trailing Mark. We knew plenty about him because he was scoring a lot of goals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d have seriously considered him whichever division we were in because he\u2019s a talented player.\"\n\nYeates played only 21 games for Boro before leaving for Sheffield United.\n\nHe's since bounced around from club to club and is still playing now for Fylde in the National League after spells at Watford, Bradford, Oldham, Blackpool, Notts County and Eastleigh.\n\nDanny Coyne\n\nDanny, Danny Coyne.\n\nIn the 10 years since his signing Coyne has gone full circle and is now back at a club and an area that he's very fond of.\n\nCoyne arrived at Boro on the back of a record-breaking season at Tranmere.\n\n\u201cGareth has told me he wants us to win the Championship and get the club back in the Premier League where we belong,\" said the experienced keeper.\n\nInjuries presented Coyne with a chance early in the season and he impressed, establishing himself as a popular figure with fans.\n\nHe left for Sheffield United in 2012 and then moved to Shrewsbury, where he had spells as a player, coach and caretaker manager before returning to Boro as part of Woodgate's coaching team.\n\n(Image: Simon Moore/Focus Images Ltd)\n\nLeroy Lita\n\nLeroy Lita was a striker in demand in the summer of 2009.\n\nStoke, Crystal Palace, Bristol City, Doncaster Rovers, Nottingham Forest, QPR, Hibs, Leeds and Wycombe were all keen - but Boro won the race to sign the frontman who had been released by cash-strapped Reading.\n\nThe Gazette reported at the time: \u201cBoro are definitely in the market for at least one new striker, though a great deal could depend on whether they receive any big bids for Afonso Alves.\n\n\u201cBoro have distanced themselves from interest in Jermaine Beckford, who scored 34 goals for Leeds last season.\n\n\u201cBut Gareth Southgate is working off a list of striker targets, and most clubs involved are aware of Boro\u2019s interest.\u201d\n\nLita scored 20 league goals in 89 appearances before leaving for Swansea for a little less than two million quid.\n\nAfter loan spells at various clubs, Lita headed for Greece and then Thailand before he returned to the club where his career started, Margate.\n\nIn the summer, he joined the coaching staff at Haverhill Rovers.\n\nSean St Ledger (loan)\n\nSearch 'Sean St Ledger, Evening Gazette, and the headline of the top story that appears is this: \"Sean St Ledger puts record straight on Taylor Swift rumours\".\n\nThe story tells of how the former Boro defender had revealed that he was NOT dating the US popstar, despite rumours going viral claiming that was the case.\n\nHe was in America because he was playing for Colorado Rapids at the time.\n\nLast year, he revealed his \"heart wasn't in it\" at Boro.\n\nIn an interview with Preston North End's website, he said: \"I've had better times.\n\n\"I spoke to Gareth Southgate on the phone and he was really good, but I didn't really want to leave (Preston). I didn't play my best football at Middlesbrough , I didn't settle in the area and Southgate was sacked - and he was probably the reason I went to Middlesbrough in the first place.\n\n\"My heart wasn't in it. If I had that decision again, with hindsight, I would have stayed at Preston and been happy, I was enjoying it.\"\n\nCaleb Folan (loan)\n\nThe dictionary definition of a transfer that didn't go to plan.\n\nAfter one substitute appearance the striker tore his hamstring in training and was ruled out for a lengthy spell. He didn't play for Boro again.\n\nBut he did go on a rather bizarre football tour.\n\nAfter a spell in the MLS, a move to Birmingham City backfired so he headed for Malaysia. And then to Myanmar. Then Canada. Thailand. And Trinidad.\n\nThere's an interview with Folan looking back on his career HERE.\n\nMarcus Bent\n\nThe former striker has endured quite the fall from grace in recent years.\n\nEarlier this year he was declared bankrupt. That came just four years after he narrowly avoided jail when he was tasered during a cocaine-fuelled armed police stand-off.\n\nBent became Gordon Strachan's first signing when he joined the club in October, 2009.\n\n\"He's a big, strong centre-forward with pace and presence and, when he's on top form, he's an asset,\" said his manager at Birmingham City, Alex McLeish.\n\nHe played just seven league games for Boro and didn't score a goal.

He's still going now and is impressing at Blackburn.\n\nRobert Huth\n\n\"I would expect there will be interest in him, but unless that interest meets an exceptional valuation, then he is a player we would like to hang on to,\" said Gareth Southgate of Robert Huth in the summer of 2009.\n\nHe dug his heels in but the German eventually headed for Stoke City for \u00a36m. Then he went to Leicester, where he probably wasn't expecting to win a Premier League title. He's retired now.\n\nTuncay\n\nWhile Southgate was hoping to hold on to Huth, he accepted Tuncay's exit was inevitable.\n\n\"We know that Mido would like to move on in an ideal world \u2013 as would Tuncay \u2013 and I'm sure those deals will happen,\" he said after one pre-season friendly.\n\nTuncay was still around at the start of the season, though, and scored two goals in three appearances before heading to join Huth at Stoke.\n\nSpells at Wolfsburg, Bolton and Bursaspor followed.\n\nAfonso Alves\n\nAnother exit that was inevitable that summer.\n\nAlves failed to report back to pre-season on time and after joining up with the squad two days late, he didn't stick around for too long, joining Qatar club Al-Sadd for a fee believed to be in the region of \u00a37m.\n\nThe striker ended up at Qatari sides Al Rayyan SC and Al Gharafa and was then training with former club Heerenveen before announcing his retirement in 2015.\n\n(Image: The Gazette)\n\nMido\n\nAh, Mido.\n\nWould you be surprised to discover the former striker is still just 36?\n\nHis playing days are long behind him but after ballooning in weight he told the Guardian in a revealing interview last year of the moment he realised his lifestyle had to change.\n\n\u201cI was 150kg and I reached a point where I couldn\u2019t walk 30 yards,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf I did, I started to feel pain in my back, my joints and my knees. I remember I was getting off my boat in Egypt five months ago \u2013 this day is the turning point in my life \u2013 and I was walking off on to an island. I had three friends with me and it was 300 yards to the end of the island. The sand was a bit heavy and it was a bit sunny and I said to them: \u2018I cannot walk.\u2019 I had to sit for 30 minutes. I was only 34. That was the moment the switch flicked.\n\n\u201cTwo days later I saw the doctor. He asked me to do blood tests. When I had the results and the doctor started to talk to me, I knew I had to change. He told me that my cholesterol is 320 and that the top of the average is 200. He said I was on the edge of being diabetic. And, to be honest, the doctor told me that if I continue with my lifestyle, there is a more than an 80% chance that I\u2019ll die before I am 40. He told me: \u2018You will die.\u2019\"\n\nLoan departures that summer included:\n\nNathan Porritt\n\nJohn Johnson\n\nJosh Walker\n\nGary Martin"}, {"url": "https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/five-years-on-middlesbroughs-last-24148969", "page_content": "This season the goal at Middlesbrough is clear. Chris Wilder won't hide from the fact that his ambition is to take Middlesbrough back to the Premier League and he plans to do as much work as possible to strengthen his squad and make that a reality.\n\nThis summer marks five years since Boro were last in the Premier League, with May 2017 seeing Boro drop out of the top flight after just one season in a tumultuous season that saw an end to Aitor Karanka's time at the club. Since then, it's proven a struggle to find a route back, with just one play-off semi-final in that time.\n\nAs Boro look to build their new squad this summer to hopefully make it back to the promised land, we wondered after five years what Boro's last Premier League representatives were up to these days. Five years on, here's where every player to make five or more league appearances that term are now.\n\nGO HERE: The Big BORO survey - have YOUR say\n\nVictor Valdes - Valdes would leave Boro at the end of the season on a free. He received multiple offers from Spain to prolong his playing career but ultimately turned them down and announced his retirement in January 2018. Since then the goalkeeper has moved into coaching, having a short spell as manager of Barcelona's youth side.\n\nBrad Guzan - Having signed a pre-contract agreement, Guzan left Boro at the end of the season too, heading back to America to sign for Atlanta United. Now 37, he remains with the MLS side and has won three trophies in the last five seasons. He has twice made the MLS All-Star team and although he didn't play, he was part of the USA's winning Gold Cup squad.\n\nCalum Chambers - On loan from Arsenal, Chambers returned to Arsenal and would spend the 2018-19 season on loan at Fulham while playing the other three seasons as a fringe option at the Emirates. He left the Gunners in January on a free transfer to join Aston Villa, making 11 appearances as he became a regular under Steven Gerrard.\n\nAntonio Barragan - After relegation, Barragan was loaned to Betis before that move was made permanent a year later. He'd have another two years with the La Liga side before joining Elche in October 2020. He's spent the last two seasons there, helping them avoid relegation from the top flight in both seasons.\n\nDaniel Ayala - Ayala remained with Boro until 2020 but was one the players bombed out as Neil Warnock came in, with his wage demands deemed too high. Despite feeling he could play at a higher level, he ended up joining Blackburn Rovers and has spent the last two seasons there, making 32 appearances in total as they finished below Boro in both campaigns.\n\nBen Gibson - Gibson would leave Boro for Burnley in a big-money move in 2018. But things didn't work out for the Teessider at Turf Moor and he was back training at Boro in 2020 having told the Clarets of his desire to leave. He would join Norwich City on loan that summer, helping them to promotion before signing permanently. This season though he couldn't help them avoid relegation. He continues to be linked with a return to Boro.\n\nBernardo - Arriving while still recovering from a knee injury, Bernardo would play more in the second half of the season. But after relegation the Colombian moved back to Spain and joined Girona. The side suffered relegation in 2019 so he spent the next season on loan at Espanyol who then also suffered relegation. He's spent the last two seasons as a regular for Girona in the Spanish second tier.\n\nFabio Da Silva - Fabio would stay at Boro after relegation, helping Tony Pulis' side make the play-offs in their first season back in the Championship. But having lost out to Aston Villa he would leave that summer to join Nantes in France. He remains there now and has made 87 appearances for them in total. He came off the bench in the final as his side won the Coupe de France this year.\n\nGeorge Friend - Friend was offered a new deal in the summer of 2020 but decided it was the right time to move on after eight years at the club. He reunited with Aitor Karanka at Birmingham but it proved short-lived, with Karanka sacked before the end of the first season. Lee Bowyer has been in charge since and though Friend has had some injury struggles he's remained an important player for the Blues.\n\nMarten de Roon - He divided opinion on Teesside but he's probably been the biggest success story of any player since. Re-joining Atalanta in Italy, De Roon has been a mainstay for them during some brilliant years which have included Champions League qualification and an Italian cup final of which he scored in the semi-final to help them get there too. He's become a regular for the Netherlands too.\n\nGrant Leadbitter - Leadbitter would remain with Boro until January 2019 when he took up the opportunity to rejoin his boyhood club Sunderland on a free transfer. He helped them reach a play-off final and two EFL Trophy finals, captaining them to their first win at Wembley since 1973 in the 2021 Papa Johns Trophy final against Tranmere Rovers. He retired that summer and is now pursuing a coaching career having recently completed his A licence.\n\nAdam Clayton - Like Friend, Clayton left Boro in 2020 to reunite with Karanka at Birmingham. But his game-time was not as forthcoming and he was released last summer. Without a club for six months, he signed for Doncaster in January. He made 12 appearances and even captain them in the last two games of the season but couldn't stop them from suffering relegation to League Two. The 33-year-old is still contracted for another 12 months, however.\n\nAdam Forshaw - Forshaw would stay for six months after relegation before joining Leeds United. He remains at Elland Road but his time there has been dogged by injuries. he suffered a hip injury seven games into the promotion-winning season that ultimately kept him out for all of that campaign and their first back in the top flight. He got back playing last term and managed 22 Premier League appearances as Leeds managed to stay up, but he missed the last seven games with a fractured kneecap.\n\nAdlene Guedioura - After failing to make an impact at Boro, the Algerian reunited with Karanka at Nottingham Forest after his deal at Boro was mutually terminated. He spent two years in Qatar before returning to sign for Sheffield United last summer. He made just two appearances and was released and joined League One strugglers Burton Albion, managed by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, in January. But he left before the end of the season citing struggles to cope with Algeria not making the World Cup. He is now considered retired.\n\nAdama Traore - While Karanka struggled to get the best of the Spaniard, Pulis managed to. Traore's form would earn him a move to Wolves where he became a regular and exciting Premier League player. In January he earned a shock loan move to Barcelona. The deal was said to have an option to make the deal permanent, but after making 17 appearances they appear unlikely to take up said option, with Wolves now said to be looking to offload him elsewhere.\n\nStewart Downing - Downing left Boro in the summer of 2019 and joined fellow Teessider Tony Mowbray at Blackburn Rovers. He spent two seasons at Ewood Park but found his game-time limited in the second of those campaign and decided to retire in 2021. Taking his coaching badges, Downing has been learning his new trade in Boro's academy and recently stated his desire to get into management and one day lead Boro from the dugout.\n\nGaston Ramirez - After relegation Ramirez was jeered by Boro fans before a home friendly against Augsburg and was sold to Serie A side Sampdoria. He spent four seasons there making over 100 appearances before being released last summer. After initially struggling to find a club, he joined Monza in Serie B in December. Monza would win promotion to Serie A for the first time in their history, via the play-offs, though Ramirez played no part in any of their last eight league games or four play-off matches. Out of contract, it seems unlikely he'll be offered a new deal.\n\nCristhian Stuani - Stuani would also depart following relegation and would join La Liga side Girona. The now-35-year-old remains there today. After two seasons they suffered relegation but Stuani has stayed with them and is captain. He's scored 63 goals in the last three seasons but hasn't been able to help them return to the top tier.\n\nViktor Fischer - The Dane left after relegation to join German side Mainz. But like at Boro, he struggled for goals and despite signing a three-year contract was sold after just six months to Copenhagen. In three-and-a-half seasons back in Denmark he managed to hit double figures just once as he helped his side win the Danish Superliga in 2018-19. Last summer he joined Antwerp in Belgium. He managed three goals and eight assists in the first half of the season but did not play again after the winter break after having ankle surgery.\n\nAlvaro Negredo - His loan spell ended in disappointment and he was then sold to Besiktas in Turkey. After just one season though he had his contract mutually terminated and he spent the next two years with Al-Nasr in the UAE. Following promotion to La Liga, Cadiz signed him in the summer of 2020. He netted eight in his first season as they avoided relegation and then ten last term as they repeated the feat. Now 36, he's just signed a 12-month extension to his deal.\n\nPatrick Bamford - After a successful loan spell previously, Bamford joined permanently in January 2017 as Boro desperately tried to add more goals. While Bamford couldn't provide that to keep Boro up, he did manage 13 before being sold in 2018 to Leeds. since then his career has gone from strength to strength as he won promotion with the Whites and hit 17 in his first year back in the Premier League and earned an England cap. Injury hampered him last term though as he managed just two goals in nine league games.\n\nRudy Gestede - Gestede was another who Warnock bombed out when he joined the club after project restart. He would move to Melbourne Victory but managed just five goals and left after one year. He joined Greek side Panetolikos but managed just three appearances before moving to Esteghlal in Iran last October. With the Persian Gulf League still ongoing, his side sit top. He has three goals after 29 games.\n\nJordan Rhodes - After barely featuring in the first half of the season he was loaned out to Sheffield Wednesday in the winter transfer window, with that move becoming permanent at the end of the season. He spent four years at Hillsborough with one of those seasons on loan at Norwich as he netted nine goals to help them win promotion. Last summer he joined Huddersfield and netted four goals including one against Boro and one in the play-off semi-final to send his side to Wembley. They would lose that game though, with the 32-year-old linked with a Boro return this summer."}, {"url": "https://www.planetsport.com/soccer/england/middlesbrough", "page_content": "Middlesbrough Profile\n\nMajor Honours League Cup (1) Year Founded 1876 Middlesbrough Twitter Middlesbrough Instagram Middlesbrough Facebook Middlesbrough Website\n\nMiddlesbrough have traditionally bounced between the top two divisions of English football and are currently in the Championship.\n\nMiddlesbrough have featured regularly in the Premier League since it was founded in the early 1990s.\n\nTheir strongest performances came under manager Steve McClaren, who won the 2004 League Cup and oversaw their run to the 2006 UEFA Cup final, where they were beaten by Sevilla. Under McClaren, they finished seventh in the top flight in 2005.\n\nMiddlesbrough have been stuck in the Championship since 2017/18 and former Manchester United and England midfielder Michael Carrick is the latest in a long list of managers given the duty of leading them back to Premier League.\n\nMiddlesbrough's early history\n\nBoro were formed in 1876 and won the FA Amateur Cup in 1895 and 1898. This came off the back of Middlesbrough reverting to being an amateur club in 1892, having gone professional back in 1889.\n\nIn 1899, Boro once again turned professional. After three seasons, they won promotion to the First Division and they subsequently enjoyed a 22-year unbroken spell in the top flight.\n\nBoro enjoyed a successful run before the start of World War One. In 1913/14, they managed to finish as high as third in the top flight, which remains the best league finish in the club's history.\n\nMiddlesbrough were relegated from the First Division in 1923/24, but three seasons later, they bounced back by winning the Division Two title.\n\nBoro were relegated after only one season back in the top flight, but were then promoted at the first attempt. The club then remained a First Division club until 1954.\n\nDuring this period, George Camsell was vital for Middlesbrough at the front of the attack. He scored a club record 325 league goals for Boro in 419 appearances.\n\nMiddlesbrough's bumpy road in the late 20th century\n\nMiddlesbrough were relegated in 1953/54 and spent 20 years outside of the top division.\n\nHowever, this spell also saw the emergence of Brian Clough, who scored 204 goals in 222 matches for Middlesbrough before he left for Sunderland. Clough would go on to become one of the most successful managers in British soccer history, particularly during his spells at Derby County and Nottingham Forest.\n\nIn 1966, Middlesbrough were relegated to the Third Division for the first time in the club's history.\n\nStan Anderson came in as manager and guided the club back to the second tier of English soccer at the first attempt. By 1974, Jack Charlton had taken over as manager and led Middlesbrough back to the top flight.\n\nIn the 1975/76 season, Middlesbrough picked up their first trophy as a professional club, winning the Anglo-Scottish Cup with a two-legged final victory over Fulham. The previous season had seen them finish seventh in the First Division, just five points off winning the league.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, Middlesbrough had fallen into severe financial difficulties. They had been relegated to the Second Division in 1982 and their on-field form continued to plummet.\n\nIn April 1986, Middlesbrough had to borrow \u00c2\u00a330,000 from the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in order to pay wages - a sign of their dire financial position.\n\nThat season ultimately saw Middlesbrough relegated to the third tier of English football.\n\nA provisional liquidator was called in that summer and the club needed \u00a3350,000 for Football League registration, which appeared to be a potentially insurmountable obstacle for a financially ailing club. However, board member Steve Gibson brought together a consortium and Middlesbrough completed their registration to the Football League with 10 minutes to spare.\n\nOver the following two seasons, Middlesbrough gained promotion to Division Two and then back into Division One. They continued to bounce between the top two tiers of English football.\n\nDespite this, Middlesbrough were founding members of the Premier League and competed in its first season in 1992/93. However, true to form, they were relegated.\n\nMiddlesbrough in the Premier League era\n\nPlayer-manager Bryan Robson took charge in 1994, putting the spotlight back on the club. Following promotion to the Premier League and signings including star players Juninho and Fabrizio Ravanelli, Boro were considered to be on the rise.\n\nHowever, Boro were relegated after the 1996/97 season despite all of their star names. The failure to honour a fixture at Blackburn in December 1996 saw them docked three points, which ultimately sunk them. In the same season, they also reached the League Cup and FA Cup finals, losing to Leicester City and Chelsea respectively.\n\nDespite the loss of their stars, they did attract former Arsenal legend Paul Merson, who was instrumental in Boro's 1997/98 successful promotion campaign.\n\nRobson kept Boro in the Premier League for two seasons, but in 2000/01, he needed the assistance of former England manager Terry Venables to guide the club to safety.\n\nRobson left in 2001 and was replaced by Steve McClaren, who went on to lead Boro through one of the most successful spells in their history.\n\nIn the 2003/04 season, Middlesbrough won the League Cup, securing the trophy with a 2-1 victory over Bolton Wanderers in the final.\n\nThis secured qualification for the UEFA Cup, a competition for which they would qualify again in the following season through their league position. Their seventh-placed finish equalled their post-war high, but they needed a penalty save in injury time from goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer to prevent Manchester City from scoring a winner. Had Robbie Fowler converted, City would have leapfrogged Boro into the final qualifying spot.\n\nIn 2006, Middlesbrough reached the final of the UEFA Cup, losing 4-0 to Sevilla. However, their campaign was noted for their ability to come back from three goals down against both FC Basel in the quarter-finals and Steaua Bucharest in the semis, with Massimo Maccarone scoring late winners in both fixtures.\n\nMcClaren went on to manage the England national team after the defeat against Sevilla and he was replaced in the Boro hotseat by club captain Gareth Southgate, who oversaw 12th and 13th-place finishes in his first two seasons in charge.\n\nBoro reached three successive FA Cup quarter-finals under Southgate, but they were relegated at the end of the 2008/09 season.\n\nSouthgate was sacked in October 2009, despite Boro being one point off an automatic promotion place, and they then went through a number of managers and mid-table finishes.\n\nMiddlesbrough won promotion to the Premier League again under Aitor Karanka in 2016, but Karanka was sacked in March 2017 and Boro were relegated at the first attempt.\n\nThey have played their football in the Championship since then and have cycled through a number of high profile managers in an attempt to return to the top flight including Tony Pulis, Neil Warnock and Chris Wilder.\n\nOn October 24 2022, Boro named Tyneside-born Carrick as their new manager. He was on the books at Boro as a nine-year-old, but made his name at West Ham and Spurs before joining Manchester United.\n\nHe was a coach under Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - and briefly took interim charge at United - but Middlesbrough is his first full-time managerial role.\n\nMiddlesbrough's fanbase\n\nOpened in 1995 as one of the first of the modern stadiums, The Riverside currently has a capacity of 34,742. Their previous ground was Ayresome Park.\n\nBoro are not one of the most recognised teams in the world, but they are a traditional club with working class roots. Fans of the club are traditionally from Middlesbrough itself or the surrounding towns.\n\nThey have one of the highest proportions of locally born season ticket holders at 80%. They also have a strong fanbase in Scandinavia, particularly Norway.\n\nMiddlesbrough have one of the highest proportions of female ticket holders, standing at 20%.\n\nBoro were also the first club in the world to launch their own TV channel, Boro TV, in 1997.\n\nMeanwhile, Middlesbrough Football Club in the Community (MFCIC) was set up by chairman Steve Gibson in 1996 and remains one of the largest community schemes in the UK. Rebranded the MFC Foundation in 2012, it delivers health, sport and inclusion projects to a number of disadvantaged people and communities across the region.\n\nMiddlesbrough's rivalries\n\nMiddlesbrough's fiercest rivalry is generally considered to be with Sunderland, with the two clubs competing in the Tees-Wear derby. Middlesbrough also have a fierce rivalry with Sunderland's big rivals Newcastle United, with that rivalry being named the Tyne-Tees derby.\n\nLeeds United are also seen as rivals by the two teams' fans, as shown in a planetfootball.com survey in 2004.\n\nMiddlesbrough's finances\n\nMiddlesbrough local and childhood fan Steve Gibson remains Boro's owner and chairman."}, {"url": "https://www.planetfootball.com/in-depth/jonathan-franks-discusses-breaking-through-at-boro-ending-up-in-iceland/", "page_content": "Jonathan Franks: Breaking through at Boro to ending up in Iceland\n\nJonathan Franks moved north to join Hartlepool when he left Middlesbrough in 2012 \u2013 but he probably didn\u2019t expect he\u2019d end up moving as far north as Iceland.\n\nFranks played once for Boro in the Premier League in 2009 and remained on the books at his boyhood club for three more years in the Championship before departing in search of regular first-team football.\n\nHe found that for three years at Hartlepool and then, after spells in the Scottish Premiership and the National League, spent two seasons with top Icelandic side IBV.\n\n\u201cI had a call about coming over to Iceland and another English lad, David Atkinson, who was there at the time, spoke to me about moving there, too,\u201d Franks says.\n\n\u201cI discussed it with my girlfriend and we decided not to go for it as it wasn\u2019t worth it financially, but IBV came back with a better deal.\n\n\u201cWe had always wanted to go and live abroad at some point, so we went for it.\u201d\n\nBoro breakthrough\n\nVestmannaeyjar is a long way across the North Sea from Middlesbrough, who Franks signed for as a youngster after he was spotted playing for his local junior team.\n\nA lifelong Boro supporter, his talent was such that he was playing for their reserve team at just 15 before signing a professional contract two years later.\n\nHe trained under Steve McClaren before being brought into the first-team picture under Gareth Southgate and making his debut in Boro\u2019s final game of the 2008-2009 season at Upton Park against West Ham United.\n\nIt was, however, a day of contrasting fortunes as Southgate\u2019s side were relegated from the Premier League.\n\n\u201cI had been on the bench a couple of times that season and remember being told to go and warm up, but not getting on,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t too disappointed because it was great for me, as a young player, to gain that kind of experience.\n\n\u201cFor the West Ham game, I wasn\u2019t in the original matchday squad and was making my way home from a reserve-team game when I got a call telling me to get back to the training ground as I was in the 18-man squad.\n\n\u201cAs a diehard Boro fan, it was really strange because we had been relegated but I had just played my first game in the Premier League for them.\n\n\u201cI will always remember, even though we had just been relegated, the other lads offering me words of encouragement as we came off the pitch and Southgate coming up to me on the coach afterwards telling me well done, but that the hard work had really started.\n\n\u201cI really appreciated him doing that.\u201d\n\nUps and downs\n\nSouthgate was gone by the October of the next campaign, with Gordon Strachan replacing him for what became a forgettable stint at the Riverside Stadium.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t work out for him, but some of his sessions on the training pitch were brilliant and he was good with me.\u201d\n\nFranks scored his first goal in January 2010, against Doncaster Rovers, and enjoyed a run in the team until a recurring back injury meant he missed the start of the 2010-2011 season due to surgery.\n\nHalfway through his rehab, Boro legend Tony Mowbray replaced Strachan.\n\n\u201cI was on the treatment table, so to speak, so I didn\u2019t make a good first impression on him,\u201d Franks says.\n\n\u201cHe told me to keep working hard and I got back in the squad and was a substitute a couple of times.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, after loans at Oxford United and Yeovil Town, Franks had to leave the Riverside Stadium in 2012 for regular action at Hartlepool, where he scored 22 goals across 163 appearances.\n\nThen, in 2015, Franks continued his journey north to join Ross County, then in the Scottish Premiership.\n\n\u201cIt was a really good experience,\u201d Franks says.\n\n\u201cI was playing in front of 60,000 fans when we played Celtic and Rangers.\n\n\u201cWe finished in the top six and won the League Cup while I was there, so I couldn\u2019t have asked for much more.\u201d\n\nMove to Iceland\n\nAnother short spell at Hartlepool followed and then Wrexham before he headed to Iceland in 2018.\n\nIt was a culture shock at first, but the father-of-three and his family settled into life in Vestmannaeyjar.\n\n\u201cIt is really quiet and relaxed,\u201d Franks says.\n\n\u201cIn the winter it is a three-hour boat ride and then an hour\u2019s drive to Reykjavik, and in the summer it only takes half an hour on the boat and then the drive.\n\n\u201cWhere we live has been brilliant for the kids as they make their own way home from school and are always outside playing football and other sports in the rain, snow and sunshine.\n\n\u201cI look out of my bedroom window and I can see the sea and mountains. There is a lot of beautiful scenery and we get a lot of tourists here.\n\n\u201cI would definitely advise more young English players to move abroad. It makes you come out of your bubble and see different cultures.\u201d\n\nWe spoke to Franks in March 2019 as he was preparing for his second season in Iceland. In January 2020 he returned to the North East, joining Stockton Town in the Northern League Division One. He\u2019s now with Whitby Town.\n\nBy Simon Yaffe\n\nREAD NEXT: A tribute to the fantastic but flawed Middlesbrough side of 96-97\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name every team to win promotion to the Premier League?"}, {"url": "https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/teesside-news/locked-up-names-faces-20-19166226", "page_content": "We have more newsletters\n\nSomething went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nGet the latest news from Teesside Crown Court direct to your inbox with our free email newsletter\n\nWhile tighter lockdown restrictions were imposed across the region in October, judges continued locking away criminals.\n\nAn armed robber, a dangerous paedophile and a violent knife attacker were among those brought to justice for their crimes.\n\nBelow is a full list of the offenders locked up at Teesside Crown Court last month:\n\nJonathan Wright\n\n(Image: evening gazette)\n\nSex offender Jonathan Wright is back behind bars after contacting the man who he repeatedly molested while he was sleeping or drunk.\n\nThe 30-year-old was sentenced to three years in prison in February last year, after he took advantage of the victim - then put photos of his crimes online.\n\nBut within days of his release in July, the 30-year-old activated a fake Facebook profile to speak to the victim.\n\nThe man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, did not know it was Wright as he was using a false name.\n\nTeesside Crown Court heard how Wright was given a sexual harm prevention order which strictly prohibited him from contacting the man.\n\nWright, of of Middlesbrough Road, South Bank, admitted two breaches of sexual harm prevention order and failing to comply with a notification requirement.\n\nHe was jailed for 14 months.\n\nWilliam Stallard\n\nDrink driver who told police his van had been stolen after killing a dad in a hit and run was locked up.\n\nWilliam Stallard was driving a white van at 50mph on a 30mph road when he collided with Michael Waistell, who was riding his mountain bike.\n\nTeesside Crown Court heard how he drove away and left the 58-year-old lying injured on Mowbray Road, Hartlepool, on July 31.\n\nRichard Bennett, prosecuting, told how Stallard pulled over and asked a woman to borrow her phone.\n\nHe said Stallard contacted 101 and told officers that his van had been stolen prior to the incident.\n\nThe court heard how Stallard provided an alcohol reading of 52 micrograms of alcohol in 100ml of breath.

out of the team due to fitness, but with Warnock admitting he hadn't been convinced by the defender.\n\nBut Grant Hall's injury means Fry has got a run in the team and he has found his form.\n\nHe's been superb this past month and looked every bit the Premier League defender he's been previously credited to be.\n\nMarc Bola\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a disappointing first season at Boro, Bola was written off by many.\n\nBut a full-time picture after Saturday's win at Forest encompassed just how much improvement Bola has shown in recent weeks under Warnock's trust and care.\n\nAgainst Forest, Bola was marking the always-lively Anthony Knockaert and barely gave him a sniff.\n\nThe latest performance this season that sees Bola completely turning around his career on Teesside and becoming a far more accomplished and reliable full-back.\n\nSam Morsy\n\nFinally establishing himself in a midfield trio alongside the brilliant Jonny Howson and George Saville, Morsy has won many fans for his no-nonsense approach.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nHe can often tread a fine disciplinary line, and had to taken off before the interval in the win over Forest having already been booked. But in general, Morsy's bite has helped Boro win almost every battle they've had in October in the middle of the park.\n\nA fine month for him where he got plenty of chances to show what he's capable of, and he grasped those with both hands.\n\nGeorge Saville\n\nAnother part of that dominant midfield trio, Saville has really enjoyed being trusted to be the man most advanced of the three midfielders.\n\n(Image: CameraSport - Ian Cook)\n\nThe Northern Ireland international arrived at Middlesbrough from Millwall as a goalscoring midfielder but has rarely shown that side of himself at the Riverside.\n\nTwo goals in two games - including a big winner against then-table-toppers Bristol City at Ashton Gate - made for a good month for Saville.\n\nLosers\n\nAshley Fletcher\n\nAlthough his injury occurred before October, it was during this month that the true extent of his hamstring problem was revealed.\n\nThe striker has undergone surgery, but it will likely keep him out until February at the earliest.\n\nDespite a brilliant month on the pitch, Warnock was a loser this month in this regard too, with the club failing to land another striker to make up for Fletcher's long-term absence before the window closed.\n\nThey're looking at free agents, with Duncan Watmore on trial recently, but the Boro boss has still not committed to being able to bring someone in.\n\nStill, the big loser here is poor Fletcher who, during the final year of his contract, and at a time where he looked ready to really get his career going, he's suffered a bad injury.\n\nGrant Hall\n\n(Image: CameraSport - Stephanie Meek)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says a lot about how positive a month it's been that two of the three players to appear on this list as losers do so because of injuries - so unfortunate circumstances rather than anything negative they've done personally.\n\nHall, like Fletcher, was injured before October and is actually closing in on a return to fitness.\n\nBut after the form of Paddy McNair, Anfernee Dijksteel and Fry, plus Wood's great showing against Forest, you wonder how Hall gets back into the side on current form.\n\nGet the latest Boro & transfer news delivered to your inbox It's a busy spell on and off the pitch.
