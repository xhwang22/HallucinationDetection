{"Edward Synge was a noted collector of books and manuscripts.": [{"url": "https://www.dib.ie/biography/synge-edward-a8427", "page_content": "Synge, Edward (1659\u20131741), clergyman, was born 5 April 1659 at Inishannon, Co. Cork, second son of Edward Synge (qv), later bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, and his wife Barbara Latham. Edward's elder brother was Samuel Synge (d. 1708), who became dean of Kildare. Synge was educated at the diocesan school, Cork, and in 1674 he went to Christ Church, Oxford. At Oxford he met William Wake, later archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he remained in correspondence throughout his life. He graduated BA in 1677.\n\nSynge's first incumbency was as rector of Laracor, Co. Meath (1682\u20136). In 1686 he became vicar of Holy Trinity and prebendary of Christ Church, Cork, which he held until 1706. He was also (1691\u20131714) rector of Rathclarin, Co. Cork, and held other parishes in the diocese of Cloyne. In 1695 William King (qv), then bishop of Dublin, put Synge's name forward for the diocese of Limerick. Synge expressed surprise that he had been considered, but he did not get Limerick, and when he was offered the deanery of Derry in 1699 he refused it on the grounds that his elderly mother could not accompany him. About four years later, the lord lieutenant, the 2nd duke of Ormond (qv) offered him the deanery of St Patrick's on behalf of the crown. However, a dispute between the crown and the chapter as to the right of presentation was only resolved when John Stearne (qv) was appointed dean and Edward Synge became chancellor of St Patrick's and vicar of St Werburgh's, where he was installed in April 1705. In 1714 King recommended Synge for the diocese of Raphoe, and he was consecrated in November that year. He remained at Raphoe for only eighteen months, and in June 1716 he was appointed archbishop of Tuam.\n\nInitially, Synge had resisted his removal from Raphoe, where he was engaged in disputes about presbyterian marriages and a campaign of conversion through education. He saw that there was a great deal of work and expense in Tuam, and there was nowhere to live, as the archbishop's palace had been burnt during the civil war. Tuam had other drawbacks: there were few resident clergy and many parishes were impropriate. Further, there was a long-running problem about the quarta pars episcopalis, that part of the tithes that had augmented the income of the archbishop, and not the parish clergy. It had been proposed to abolish this custom in Tuam, but before the necessary legislation was enacted the documents were lost in the 1641 rebellion. Synge was advised to encourage the Tuam clergy to petition for the abolition of the quarta pars, to supplement the incomes of clergy who were prepared to resign from pluralities, and to provide for parishes that had not been served since the reformation.\n\nOn the growing constitutional crisis arising from the Annesley v. Sherlock case (over the appellate jurisdictions of the Irish house of lords and its British counterpart) Synge told Wake that Ireland was \u2018a kingdom (not a county Palatine) exactly formd [sic] according to the model of England . . . \u2019 (Synge to Wake, 1 Nov. 1717 (Dublin City Library, Gilbert MS 28, f. 100)). With Archbishop King, he opposed actively but unsuccessfully the enactment by the Irish parliament of a toleration act for protestant dissenters. Here again Synge was said to have conducted himself \u2018with the greatest warmth and zeal for the nation's honour\u2019 (William Nicholson to Wake, 11 July 1719 (ibid., f. 236). In his speech on the bill, Synge observed that although he had always believed in limited toleration for dissenters, he saw that religion was a continuing cause of strife, wars, and rebellions. Citing the existence of 180 sects in England which had flourished during the civil war, he warned that it should be not thought that these \u2018wild sects and parties\u2019 had gone. If the bill were passed, he said, not only the Church of Ireland, but the civil state and even Christianity itself would be put at risk (Edward Synge speech on toleration, MS in private possession). Both Synge and King were out of favour as a result of their opposition to the bill.\n\nSynge acknowledged the difficulty that catholics had in taking the oaths of allegiance and abjuration, excluding them from full rights in a civil society. He believed that catholics and dissenters should be prosecuted only if they posed a real danger to the state, and proposed an oath of allegiance to meet the objections of both Roman Catholics and quakers. During his life, Synge published nearly sixty volumes of sermons and religious tracts, and he is now seen as one of the most influential religious commentators of his time. The Appendix to his Gentleman's religion (1698) is thought by Berman to have been written in answer to John Toland's (qv) Christianity not mysterious (1696). To some extent Synge shared Toland's rationalism and deism, but he rebutted Toland's case that religion possessed no mysteries. With William King, George Berkeley (qv), and Francis Hutcheson (qv), Synge discussed the problem of innate perception, using the analogy of a blind man's understanding of shape and form. In October 1714 he preached a sermon at St Werburgh's which was attacked for advocating deism and which resulted in a sharp exchange of pamphlets. Synge died in Tuam on 24 July 1741, where he was buried.\n\nHe married (1690) Anne, daughter of Nicholas Proude, dean of Clonfert. They had five children, two of whom became bishops. The eldest, Edward Synge (d. 1762), was given (1719) the living of St Audoen's, Dublin, which carried with it a prebendal stall in St Patrick's cathedral. Like his father, Synge took a robust view of the penal laws, which he criticised on the grounds that they encouraged a \u2018furious and blind zeal for religion\u2019 which could disturb the civil state, and in 1725 he preached on religious toleration to members of both houses of parliament. Made provost of Tuam in 1726, he was consecrated bishop of Clonfert in 1730, and in 1731 was translated to Cloyne. In 1733 he was translated to Ferns and Leighlin, and in 1740 he went to Elphin, where he remained until his death. He was a close friend of Francis Hutcheson the philosopher, who acknowledged his debt to Synge's critique of the text of his An inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue (1726). In 1749 Synge organised a census of the diocese of Elphin, which covers most of Co. Roscommon, and parts of south-east Co. Sligo and north-east Co. Galway. It was a remarkable undertaking: forms were specially designed and printed and clergy and churchwardens were persuaded to act as enumerators. The census is housed in the NAI (NAI, MS 2466). Synge married (1725) Jane Curtis and it is through his letters to their daughter Alicia that he is best known."}, {"url": "https://www.dib.ie/biography/synge-edward-hutchinson-a9583", "page_content": "Synge, Edward Hutchinson (1890\u20131957), physicist, was born on 1 June 1890 in south Dublin, eldest child of Edward Synge and his wife Ellen (n\u00e9e Price). He had two brothers, Victor Millington Synge (qv) and John Lighton Synge (qv), and a sister. The Synge family was connected to notable personalities in Irish ecclesiastical and military life; John Millington Synge (qv) was a brother of Edward Synge senior. James Price (qv), father of Ellen Synge, was a distinguished engineer. John Lighton Synge, Edward's younger brother, made important contributions to relativity and mechanics. Edward Synge senior was a land agent for the Gormanston estates in Meath and elsewhere, and for a number of years the family lived at Rathe House, near Nobber, Co. Meath.\n\nThe family moved to Bray, Co. Wicklow, in 1903, and later lived in Sandycove and Dundrum, Co. Dublin. Edward Hutchinson Synge, known in the family as 'Hutchie', was educated by governesses, a tutor, and briefly at Corrig School, D\u00fan Laoghaire (Kingstown). He never studied physics in a university setting. He cut short a brilliant undergraduate career at TCD, in which he specialised in mathematics and Old Irish, when his uncle J. M. Synge died in 1909, leaving him a substantial legacy. Edward had won the Townsend prize in mathematics at the end of his first year, and won a foundation scholarship the next year. When he received his inheritance, he chose to retire from the world at large (apart from some travels to the Aran islands and the Continent), devoting himself to private scholarship in the family home, where he also built up a collection of books.\n\nUp to 1930 he engaged in some significant interactions with society at large. He was instrumental in having his uncle's Playboy of the western world republished in a special edition, with illustrations by Se\u00e1n Keating (qv). It was thanks to Edward H. Synge's forceful advocacy that the publication of the collected works of William Rowan Hamilton (qv) began; the first volume was edited by John Lighton Synge. Edward castigated his Dublin contemporaries for failing to support the publication, and corresponded with Albert Einstein, who concurred with his view.\n\nEdward lived almost as a recluse in the family home until 1936, at which time he was confined to a mental hospital, at first as a voluntary patient, but a year later he was made a ward of court and involuntarily confined. He remained in Bloomfield Hospital (despite appeals for release) until his death in 1957. His notebooks from the last period of his life and work have unfortunately been lost.\n\nA remarkable series of nine papers in the Philosophical Magazine, published between 1922 and 1932, forms the main record of his achievements. He was a visionary physicist who conducted his remarkable researches in self-imposed isolation. Among other things, he conceived the detailed design of the scanning near-field optical microscope, or SNOM. His ideas and a description of near-field microscopy predated, by almost fifty years, work carried out independently and patented by IBM and others, which led to the important instrumentation now widely used in nanotechnology. Before these developments, microscopy in the early twentieth century had reached a state which was regarded then as the most accurate possible; the scale at which microscopes could work was held to be limited by the width of the wavelength of light.\n\nIn Synge's paper, a revolutionary technique was envisaged in full practical detail. He proposed to call it 'hyper-microscopy' but this term was not taken up. The proposed ultra-microscope technique hyper-microscope was to use a light source of dimensions less than the wavelength of light. This light source, perhaps a tiny hole letting light through, was to be held extremely close to a sample. (Synge seems to have considered that the sample would routinely be a biological slide preparation.) The light transmitted through the hole was to be measured by a photoelectric detector, even at that date well-established technology, used for example by G. F. Fitzgerald (qv) to detect starlight (in 1892). Scanning or 'rastering' of the relative position of the source and/or sample would build up the image of the specimen. Synge proposed that the piezoelectric effect be used to facilitate the rapid scanning necessary to build the image. This was, like the theory on which the technique was based, a highly original suggestion. Only Einstein, with whom Synge again corresponded, seems to have understood what the Irishman was suggesting, and his response was encouraging, while recognising that the invention was much before its time.\n\nSynge was acutely aware of the great technical difficulties that would have to be faced in making the instrument. He discussed the major problems that he foresaw and proposed possible solutions. In this he showed an awareness of both available expertise and its limitations \u2013 precisely the same issues faced by the experimentalists who would eventually exploit the instrument in our own time. All this was done without any practical laboratory experience whatsoever, so far as we know.\n\nSynge also produced papers on stellar parallax, on the twinkling of stars, and on piezoelectricity. On account of his third paper in the Philosophical Magazine he is given full priority in the invention of LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), another key modern technology now used to probe the Earth's atmosphere. He thought that light scattered from searchlight beams could be detected and used to characterise the gases composing the upper atmosphere; his idea had to wait until the invention of the laser before it became practicable.\n\nSynge's fifth paper suggests a solution to another problem of the time; as their size increased, astronomical telescopes were increasingly difficult to construct, because of physical difficulties with polishing and weight. Synge suggested using an array of smaller mirrors, and presented calculations to explain and justify his ideas. Multiple mirror telescopes on this principle were not constructed until the mid-twentieth century, when Synge's proposal had long been forgotten.\n\nSynge's troubled life ended years before he was given any credit for the scientific developments which his work presaged. Today we can guess that Synge suffered from a condition like Asperger's syndrome, in which social behaviour is highly inhibited, sometimes in favour of concentrated and productive study. It is increasingly recognised that such individuals have a unique contribution to make to our society. His was an extreme case; however, awareness of his condition may shed light on the personality of his uncle, who showed similar if milder tendencies, well documented by literary historians. Edward's early aspiration was to follow in his benefactor uncle's footsteps. What eventually caused him to switch the focus of his extraordinary genius to the technology of physical science we may never know. Much remains incomplete in our knowledge of his life.\n\nHe died 26 May 1957 in Bloomfield Hospital, Donnybrook, Dublin, of cerebral thrombosis, and was buried with his parents in Dublin's Mount Jerome cemetery, with only a few relatives attending. It was much later that his niece Cathleen Synge Morawetz (herself a distinguished mathematician) arranged to have 'Scientist and Inventor' inscribed on the gravestone. A symposium in TCD in 2012 revived the memory of Synge in the college that he had abandoned without graduating, and was accompanied by a biographical publication that includes Synge's main publications."}, {"url": "https://www.dib.ie/biography/synge-edward-a8426", "page_content": "Synge, Edward (c.1614\u20131678), clergyman, was baptised 14 August 1614 in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, England, second son of Richard Synge, tanner, and bailiff of Bridgnorth, and his wife Alice Rowley of Rowley, Shropshire. The original family name was Millington; it was apparently changed due to the singing abilities of the family. Synge came to Ireland at the suggestion of his elder brother George, Church of Ireland dean of Dromore and later bishop of Cloyne (1638\u201341), and was educated in Drogheda and at TCD , where he graduated MA .\n\nOrdained into the Church of Ireland, he was appointed rector of Killary in Meath (1638\u201360) and Drumully in Clogher (1640\u201360), and prebendary of Aghadowny, Co. Londonderry (1640\u201361). At some point he married Barbara Latham (d. 22 December 1677) of New Place, Co. Londonderry; they had at least three sons and five daughters. Noted as a preacher, Synge was chaplain general to the royalist forces in Leinster during the 1640s, and in July 1647 was one of a number of Dublin clergymen to sign a declaration stating their adherence to the Book of Common Prayer. Synge was appointed as a minor canon of St Patrick's cathedral (1647\u201360), and as vicar of Lusk, Co. Dublin (1648\u201361), and Inishannon, Co. Cork (1648\u201361), dean of Elphin (1648\u201360), and archdeacon of Cloyne (1648\u201361). Soon after, he may have been appointed chancellor of Christ Church cathedral by James Butler (qv), marquess of Ormond, but this remains uncertain. However, the potential privileges of these positions were offset by the parlous condition of the Church of Ireland at this time. After 1647 Synge had removed himself to his benefice in Donegal and spent most of the 1650s there. However, he occasionally ministered to Richard Boyle (qv), 2nd earl of Cork. He remained an episcopalian, continuing to use the Book of Common Prayer in the north-west throughout the 1650s. This prompted numerous complaints, but an association with Robert Gorges (qv), clerk of the Irish council, ensured that these were disregarded.\n\nSynge enjoyed good relations with many figures in the ruling elites of Ireland during the interregnum and after the restoration, a fact testified to by his plethora of appointments. His eldest son, Samuel, married a daughter of Archbishop Michael Boyle (qv). In 1660 Edward Synge was nominated to serve on the presidency council of Munster, and on 6 August 1660 was nominated as bishop of Limerick, being consecrated on 27 January 1661; he held the see in tandem with that of Ardfert and Aghadoe. In 1661 he also graduated DD from TCD. Of the ten bishops and two archbishops appointed in 1660, Synge was one of only three who had served in Ireland during the 1650s. In his new position, he was involved in a dispute with Ormond over the ownership of church lands in Limerick. On 21 December 1663 Synge was made bishop of Cork. As with his previous post, he held the sees in tandem. Synge's elder brother, George, who held Cloyne prior to 1641, had been ordered by the then viceroy, Thomas Wentworth (qv), earl of Strafford, to regain diocesan lands lost to figures such as Richard Boyle (qv), 1st earl of Cork, since the sixteenth century. The see was divided in two to facilitate this, but little progress was made prior to 1641; consequently more lands were lost during the interregnum, and the sees were reunited after the restoration. Throughout the 1660s Synge embarked on what became an acrimonious campaign via the acts of settlement and explanation, and the exchequer court, to regain these lands. A good relationship with the Boyle interest ensured that Roger Boyle (qv), earl of Orrery, acted as arbitrator in a number of the ensuing disputes. Synge's exertions were strongly opposed by Murrough O'Brien (qv), earl of Inchiquin, who now occupied some of the holdings; indeed, at one point Inchiquin's men assaulted Synge's son George. However, he succeeded in obtaining much of the outstanding diocesan land; by 1668 his income was calculated at \u00a31,400, and in 1677 he was still receiving leases under the terms of the act of explanation.\n\nIn October 1675 Synge was appointed to a commission dealing with the outstanding arrears of the \u201949 officers. He died 22 December 1678, and after his death the sees were divided. In 1679 Synge's eldest son Samuel attempted to transfer diocesan lands into the possession of the family, but in 1697 this was contested and reversed by the then bishop of Cloyne, Edward Jones. Two of Synge's sons entered the Church of Ireland: Samuel became dean of Kildare, and Edward (qv) enjoyed a distinguished career as archbishop of Tuam."}, {"url": "https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754694.001.0001/acref-9780199754694-e-2040", "page_content": "How to Use this Encyclopedia\n\nEdward Synge was born at Inishannon (Ireland) on 6 April 1659, and died at Tuam on 24 July 1741 ...\n\nPRINTED FROM OXFORD REFERENCE (www.oxfordreference.com).

He was the son of the elder Edward Synge, who was himself involved in the philosophical debates of the time.\n\nHe was educated in Trinity College Dublin (M.A. in 1712 and D.D. in 1728) and after being chancellor of St. Patrick\u2019s (1726), was successively bishop of Clonfert (1730), Cloyne (1731), Ferns (1733), and finally Elphin (1740 until his death).\n\nSynge was close to Francis Hutcheson and appears to have been a member of the Molesworth Circle. He assisted Hutcheson in developing revising his work and Hutcheson himself acknowledged that Synge had devised the general scheme of \u201cInquiry into Beauty and Virtue\u201d before Hutcheson. The connection seems to have continued after Hutcheson\u2019s departure for Glasgow and until his death, since his son dedicated the posthumous collection of his father\u2019s works to Synge . Letters from the 1760s from Edward Synge giving advice to the younger Hutcheson still exist.\n\n\n\nSynge was also friendly with George Berkeley who, like Hutcheson, was living in Dublin at the same time.\n\nDespite his connections, Synge\u2019s work in philosophy is minor, and is centred in the areas of moral and political philosophy. He argued for limited toleration (as his father before him had done), most notably in the sermon of 23rd October 1725 which he preached to the members of the House of Commons while prebendary of St Patricks. The sermon drew acclaim and was printed. It also drew vehement disagreement from the Church of Ireland vicar of Naas, Stephen Radcliffe, who wrote a 45 page pamphlet opposing the arguments of the sermon. Edward Synge wrote a vindication of his sermon in reply, along with a detailed outline of a possible oath that might be acceptable to Catholics\n\nStephen Radcliffe advocated using force against those who were unorthodox in their religious opinions. Synge argued that force ought not be used by magistrates against the religiously unorthodox \u201cif the publick civil interests are in no way affected\u201d, aligning himself with Locke (and Francis Hutcheson). Like Locke, however, while he says everyone has a right to worship according to his conscience, atheists are beyond the pale since their beliefs are destructive of society. But otherwise \u201call persons in a society, whose principles of religion have no tendency to hurt the public, have a right to a toleration.\u201d\n\nIn his reply to Radcliffe and following in his father\u2019s footsteps, Synge put forward his own version of an oath that might be acceptable to Catholics, and a proposal that the country accommodate 500 secular priests to serve the Catholic community. He made no other proposals regarding the Penal Laws, but noted that the limitations put on Catholic ownership of land meant they turned to trade, and held their wealth in money. Money was not as good a guarantor of their peaceful behaviour as money, and money could be used in revolt more readily\n\nSynge had six children, only one of whom, Alicia (1733-1807) survived into adulthood. Synge was widowed in 1737 and when he was promoted to Bishop of Elphin Alicia stayed in the family home in Kevin Street. Synge lived in Roscommon in the summer, and with her in Dublin for the parliamentary winter term. While separated he wrote her a series of letters, collected as The Synge Letters. Bishop Edward Synge to His Daughter Alicia, Roscommon to Dublin 1746-1752. Extracts have also been printed in the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing (extracts on google). These letters give insight into the paternal relationship to daughters, and education and care of girls in the 18th century.

In an astonishing paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy ( ... 1950) he was able, for the first time, to penetrate and explore in detail the region inside the Schwarzschild radius ( what we now call a black hole ) . At a time when many relativists thought that it did not even make sense to talk about this region, this work is very remarkable indeed.\n\n1972\n\n12\n\n1992\n\nEvery one of the other 88 % has been deeply influenced by his geometric vision and the clarity of his expression.\n\n200\n\n11\n\nEvery single book and every single paper is a remarkable work of art.\n\n1956\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that hardly a single space-time diagram is to be found in the standard texts on relativity before Synge's own presentation in 1956 .

The origin of the name \"Synge\" is described in the introduction to General relativity : papers in honour of J L Synge :-John Synge's mother, Ellen Price, was of Scottish origin, being descended from the Scottish Stuarts, in particular a Sir William Stuart who went to Ireland in the early seventeenth century.After being educated at St Andrews College in Dublin, Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin in. There his achievements were quite remarkable, winning a Foundation Scholarship at the end of his first year. This scholarship was normally won by students in their third year of study. He was awarded his B.A. inin Mathematics and Experimental Physics. He received the Large Gold Medal for his outstanding work.After graduating, Synge was appointed to a lectureship in mathematics at Trinity College, but he only held the post for a short time, leaving for Canada in. fromtoSynge was an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto. Then inhe returned to Trinity College, Dublin where he was elected to a fellowship and also appointed to the chair of Natural Philosophythe older name for PhysicsInSynge headed back to North America and again was appointed to the University of Toronto, this time as Professor of Applied Mathematics. He spent some time inat Princeton University and, in, he was a visiting professor at Brown University. InSynge was appointed as Chairman of the Mathematics Department of Ohio State University, then, three years later, as Head of the Mathematics Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburg. He also spent a short time as ballistic mathematician in the US Air Force duringInhe returned to Ireland to take up the post of Senior Professor in the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. This School, which had been set up when the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies had been founded in, had several outstanding members including Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger who was also a Senior Professor.P S Floridesdescribes the range of topics that Synge worked on:-Synge's most important contributions to theoretical physics were, in many respects, the product of his great skill and insight as a geometer:-Synge retired inand during his time at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies about% of all workers in relativity theory studied there. Professor Hermann Bondi , who gave the first J L Synge Public Lecture in, remarked:-During his long scientific career, Synge published overpapers andbooks. Three of his books were aimed at providing an understanding of science to a wider audience and, with such a fine expository style, he was well suited to write such works. As Florides says in:-Synge's classic, written in, had a large influence:-The preface to thework contains the delightful thought:-Synge's skill at communication was not only a gift that he had for writing, but also a gift in lecturing. His son-in-law Douglas Dryer wrote:-Those who were fortunate enough to have attended Synge lectures say that he combined all three.Synge received many honours for his work. The greatest of these was probably his election as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and was president of the Royal Irish Academy fromtoHe is described inas:-As to hobbies, Synge was a keen cyclist, was passionately interested in sailing and painted some very fine compositions.

We mention three other members of the family. First John Millington Synge, John Lighton Synge's uncle, who was a playwright and a powerful poetic dramatist who portrayed the primitive life of the Aran Islands and the western Irish coast. Secondly there was Richard Laurence Millington Synge, Nobel laureate for Chemistry in, who shared the Prize for Chemistry with A J P Martin for their development of partition chromatography, a method used to separate mixtures of closely related chemicals such as amino acids for identification.

Cork, of which parish his father was at the time vicar.\n\nThe family belonged to Bridgnorth in Shropshire, where the name appears originally to have been Millington. According to tradition, they acquired the name of Sing or Synge from the sweetness of voice of one of the family.\n\nGeorge Synge (1594\u20131653), uncle of the younger Edward, born at Bridgnorth in 1594. was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, whence he matriculated on 16 Feb. 1610, graduated B.A. on 21 Oct. 1613, and M.A. on 12 June 1616. Subsequently he went to Ireland, where he found a warm patron in Christopher Hampton [q. v.], archbishop of Armagh, who constituted him vicar-general of his diocese and dean of Dromore; in which capacity his \u2018so eloquent, so godly, so very leaud, railing, cursing censure\u2019 of James Croxton\u2019s attempts at auricular \u200bconfession had, but for the generally disturbed state of the kingdom in 1638, drawn down upon him the vengeance of Archbishop Laud (see Prynne, Canterburies Doom, p. 195; Strafford, Letters, ii. 185, 212, 249). On 11 Nov. 1638 he was consecrated bishop of Cloyne at Drogheda; but on the breaking out of the rebellion in October 1641 he fled for safety to Dublin. In February 1644 he was sworn of the Irish privy council, and on the death of Dr. John Maxwell (1590?\u20131647) [q. v.] in February 1646\u20137 was nominated to the archbishopric of Tuam; but, failing to obtain possession on account of the war, he returned in the following year to Bridgnorth, where he died in 1653, and was buried on 31 Aug. in the church of St. Mary Magdalene. He was the author of a learned reply to the Jesuit Malone\u2019s answer to Archbishop Ussher, entitled \u2018A Rejoinder to the Reply, published by the Jesuits under the name of William Malone,\u2019 Dublin, 1632.\n\nIt was at his suggestion that his younger brother, Edward Synge (d. 1678), then a mere boy, but destined for the church, likewise repaired to Ireland. Having received a sound education at the school at Drogheda and Trinity College, Dublin, he was, after taking orders, preferred to the rectory of Killary in the barony of Lower Slane, co. Meath. In 1647 he was appointed a minor canon of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin, and shortly afterwards vicar of Inishannon in co. Cork, and dean of Elphin. During the rule of the Commonwealth he persisted in using the English liturgy in all the public offices of his ministry, being secured from prosecution by his interest with Dr. Gorge, the then auditor-general. He was consecrated bishop of Limerick on 27 Jan. 1661, and on 21 Dec. 1663 translated to the united sees of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. He died on 22 Dec. 1678, having acquired a reputation as a singularly able preacher. Of his two sons, Samuel the elder, having graduated B.A. from Christ Church College, Oxford, on 26 Nov. 1674, proceeding M.A. on 3 July 1677, became dean of Kildare on 17 April 1679, and, dying on 30 Nov., was buried in the family vault in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard, near Archbishop Marsh\u2019s library, on 2 Dec. 1708.\n\nEdward, the younger son, after being educated at the grammar school at Cork, was admitted a commoner at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1674, and graduated B.A. in 1677, but on his father\u2019s death returned to Ireland, finishing his studies at Trinity College, Dublin, where he was admitted ad eundem, and took the degree of M.A. Having been ordained priest and deacon, he was preferred to the two small parishes of Laracor and Augher in the diocese of Meath, being both together of about the yearly value of 100l. These he afterwards exchanged for the vicarage of Christ Church, Cork, of the same value, but one of the heaviest cures in Ireland. Here he remained for more than twenty years, his income having been in the meantime increased to about 400l. a year by the gift of certain small benefices tenable with his cure. In 1699 he was offered the deanery of Derry, but declined it out of regard for his mother, who was unwilling to leave Cork. He was chosen proctor for the chapter in the convocation summoned in 1703, and was shortly afterwards nominated by the lord-lieutenant, the Duke of Ormonde, to the deanery of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin. But the right of election being claimed by the chapter, a compromise was effected through the mediation of Archbishop William King [q. v.]; John Sterne [q. v.] (afterwards bishop of Clogher) succeeding to the deanery and Synge to the chancellorship, with the parish of St. Werburgh annexed. He was installed on 2 April 1705, and during the next eight years that he resided in Dublin he established a reputation for himself as one of the most industrious clergymen and popular preachers in the city. At the same time he took his degree of D.D., and on Sterne\u2019s promotion to the see of Dromore, having been appointed by Archbishop King his vicar-general, he was chosen to represent the chapter of St. Patrick\u2019s in the convocation that met in 1713. On 7 Nov. 1714 he was consecrated bishop of Raphoe in the church of Dunboyne, co. Meath, by the archbishop of Cashel, and on 8 June 1716 was translated to the archbishopric of Tuam, including the ancient sees of Enaghdune and Kilfenora, together with the wardenship of Galway. He was enthroned at Kilfenora on 7 Nov., and one of his earliest actions, and that which gained him the goodwill of his clergy, was the resignation, in pursuance of an old scheme of the Earl of Strafford for improving the livings in his diocese, of the \u2018quarta pars episcopalis\u2019 or fourth part of the tithes, which his immediate predecessors had nevertheless enjoyed [see Vesey, John, archbishop of Tuam, and for a full discussion of the subject Ware\u2019s Works, ed. Harris, i. 619]. To this end he procured an act of parliament in 1717 settling it permanently on such rectors, vicars, and curates as personally discharged their cures. In 1716 he was admitted a privy councillor, and in that and the two following years was one of the keepers of the great seal in the absence of the lord high chancellor. Like King himself, he \u200bfell into disfavour with the government owing to his opposition to the Toleration Bill in 1719, which he thought calculated to promote the growth of popery (Report of his speech, Addit. MS. 6117, ff. 107\u201321), and, in consequence of having in the following spring alluded to the act as a reason for greater zeal in preaching against popery, he was charged with stirring up disaffection against the state. But from this charge he \u2018acquitted himself so well that it dropped of itself,\u2019 and in 1721 he was again included in the commission for administering the great seal. He died at Tuam on 24 July 1741, and was buried in the churchyard of his cathedral at the east end of the church. He desired that no monument should be erected to his memory; but the capital of the ancient cross of Tuam placed over his grave testifies to the universal respect in which he was held.\n\nSynge was a man of considerable learning, but his writings, consisting of short tracts and sermons, of which there is a full if not complete list in Nichols\u2019s \u2018Literary Anecdotes\u2019 (i. 378), were chiefly devoted to the promotion of practical piety. A number of them (some thirty-four) were after his death collected and published in 4 vols. 12mo, London, 1744. Of these, several, having passed through many editions during his lifetime, have since been adopted, and frequently reprinted for general distribution, by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. It has been said of Synge that his life was as exemplary as his writings were instructive; that what he wrote he believed, and what he believed he practised. As the son of one bishop, the nephew of another, himself an archbishop, and the father of two other bishops, his position in ecclesiastical biography is probably unique.\n\nSynge\u2019s two sons, Edward and Nicholas, were both graduates of Trinity College, Dublin; the former proceeding M.A. in 1712 and D.D. in 1728; the latter M.A. in 1715 and D.D. in 1734. Edward, from being chancellor of St. Patrick\u2019s, Dublin, was on 28 May 1730 elevated to the bishopric of Clonfert, being consecrated by his father in St. Werburgh\u2019s Church, Dublin, on 7 June. Subsequently he was translated to Cloyne on 21 March 1731, to Ferns on 8 Feb. 1733, and to Elphin on 15 May 1740. He died at Dublin on 27 Jan. 1762, and was buried in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard on 1 Feb. Nicholas, having been collated to the archdeaconry of Dublin in 1743, was on 26 Jan. 1746 consecrated bishop of Killaloe. He died in December 1770, the fifth and last prelate of the family, and was buried in St. Patrick\u2019s churchyard on 1 Jan. 1771.\n\n[Biographia Britannica based on a memoir contributed by the archbishop\u2019s son Edward and practically reprinted in Chalmers\u2019s Biographical Dictionary; Wood\u2019s Athen\u00e6 Oxon. ed.

Cork, second son of Edward Synge (qv), later bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, and his wife Barbara Latham. Edward's elder brother was Samuel Synge (d. 1708), who became dean of Kildare. Synge was educated at the diocesan school, Cork, and in 1674 he went to Christ Church, Oxford. At Oxford he met William Wake, later archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he remained in correspondence throughout his life. He graduated BA in 1677.\n\nSynge's first incumbency was as rector of Laracor, Co. Meath (1682\u20136). In 1686 he became vicar of Holy Trinity and prebendary of Christ Church, Cork, which he held until 1706. He was also (1691\u20131714) rector of Rathclarin, Co. Cork, and held other parishes in the diocese of Cloyne. In 1695 William King (qv), then bishop of Dublin, put Synge's name forward for the diocese of Limerick. Synge expressed surprise that he had been considered, but he did not get Limerick, and when he was offered the deanery of Derry in 1699 he refused it on the grounds that his elderly mother could not accompany him. About four years later, the lord lieutenant, the 2nd duke of Ormond (qv) offered him the deanery of St Patrick's on behalf of the crown. However, a dispute between the crown and the chapter as to the right of presentation was only resolved when John Stearne (qv) was appointed dean and Edward Synge became chancellor of St Patrick's and vicar of St Werburgh's, where he was installed in April 1705. In 1714 King recommended Synge for the diocese of Raphoe, and he was consecrated in November that year. He remained at Raphoe for only eighteen months, and in June 1716 he was appointed archbishop of Tuam.\n\nInitially, Synge had resisted his removal from Raphoe, where he was engaged in disputes about presbyterian marriages and a campaign of conversion through education. He saw that there was a great deal of work and expense in Tuam, and there was nowhere to live, as the archbishop's palace had been burnt during the civil war. Tuam had other drawbacks: there were few resident clergy and many parishes were impropriate. Further, there was a long-running problem about the quarta pars episcopalis, that part of the tithes that had augmented the income of the archbishop, and not the parish clergy. It had been proposed to abolish this custom in Tuam, but before the necessary legislation was enacted the documents were lost in the 1641 rebellion. Synge was advised to encourage the Tuam clergy to petition for the abolition of the quarta pars, to supplement the incomes of clergy who were prepared to resign from pluralities, and to provide for parishes that had not been served since the reformation.\n\nOn the growing constitutional crisis arising from the Annesley v. Sherlock case (over the appellate jurisdictions of the Irish house of lords and its British counterpart) Synge told Wake that Ireland was \u2018a kingdom (not a county Palatine) exactly formd [sic] according to the model of England . . . \u2019 (Synge to Wake, 1 Nov. 1717 (Dublin City Library, Gilbert MS 28, f. 100)). With Archbishop King, he opposed actively but unsuccessfully the enactment by the Irish parliament of a toleration act for protestant dissenters. Here again Synge was said to have conducted himself \u2018with the greatest warmth and zeal for the nation's honour\u2019 (William Nicholson to Wake, 11 July 1719 (ibid., f. 236). In his speech on the bill, Synge observed that although he had always believed in limited toleration for dissenters, he saw that religion was a continuing cause of strife, wars, and rebellions. Citing the existence of 180 sects in England which had flourished during the civil war, he warned that it should be not thought that these \u2018wild sects and parties\u2019 had gone. If the bill were passed, he said, not only the Church of Ireland, but the civil state and even Christianity itself would be put at risk (Edward Synge speech on toleration, MS in private possession). Both Synge and King were out of favour as a result of their opposition to the bill.\n\nSynge acknowledged the difficulty that catholics had in taking the oaths of allegiance and abjuration, excluding them from full rights in a civil society. He believed that catholics and dissenters should be prosecuted only if they posed a real danger to the state, and proposed an oath of allegiance to meet the objections of both Roman Catholics and quakers. During his life, Synge published nearly sixty volumes of sermons and religious tracts, and he is now seen as one of the most influential religious commentators of his time. The Appendix to his Gentleman's religion (1698) is thought by Berman to have been written in answer to John Toland's (qv) Christianity not mysterious (1696). To some extent Synge shared Toland's rationalism and deism, but he rebutted Toland's case that religion possessed no mysteries. With William King, George Berkeley (qv), and Francis Hutcheson (qv), Synge discussed the problem of innate perception, using the analogy of a blind man's understanding of shape and form. In October 1714 he preached a sermon at St Werburgh's which was attacked for advocating deism and which resulted in a sharp exchange of pamphlets. Synge died in Tuam on 24 July 1741, where he was buried.\n\nHe married (1690) Anne, daughter of Nicholas Proude, dean of Clonfert. They had five children, two of whom became bishops. The eldest, Edward Synge (d. 1762), was given (1719) the living of St Audoen's, Dublin, which carried with it a prebendal stall in St Patrick's cathedral. Like his father, Synge took a robust view of the penal laws, which he criticised on the grounds that they encouraged a \u2018furious and blind zeal for religion\u2019 which could disturb the civil state, and in 1725 he preached on religious toleration to members of both houses of parliament. Made provost of Tuam in 1726, he was consecrated bishop of Clonfert in 1730, and in 1731 was translated to Cloyne. In 1733 he was translated to Ferns and Leighlin, and in 1740 he went to Elphin, where he remained until his death. He was a close friend of Francis Hutcheson the philosopher, who acknowledged his debt to Synge's critique of the text of his An inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue (1726). In 1749 Synge organised a census of the diocese of Elphin, which covers most of Co. Roscommon, and parts of south-east Co. Sligo and north-east Co. Galway. It was a remarkable undertaking: forms were specially designed and printed and clergy and churchwardens were persuaded to act as enumerators. The census is housed in the NAI (NAI, MS 2466). Synge married (1725) Jane Curtis and it is through his letters to their daughter Alicia that he is best known."}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_National_Biography,_1885-1900/Synge,_Edward", "page_content": "\u200bSYNGE, EDWARD (1659\u20131741), archbishop of Tuam, second and younger son of Edward Synge, bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross, was born on 6 April 1659 at Inishannon in co.

At the highest social level are illustrated accounts of royal marriages and funerals which are well represented in the French, German, and Dutch holdings. Dysfunction in society is recorded in law reports which are held in abundance for Ireland and Great Britain and there is a substantial holding of 18th-century French legal M\u00e9moires.\n\nNewspapers and periodicals become increasingly important during the 19th century as a mirror of middle- and upper-class society. The Illustrated London News is the best-known of the 19th-century reporting periodicals but others such as The Graphic and the Dublin-published The Lady of the House are good sources. Much can be gleaned about leisure pursuits from the music and theatre collections.\n\nThere are numerous works on the lives of the poor in the 19th century, generally in studies of cities although agricultural surveys report on the lives of the rural poor.\n\nAttitudes to perceived social evils can be studied in sermons printed from the 16th to the 19th century. Sermons range from denunciations of social practices to pious memorials of the dead and charitable appeals.\n\nThe Manuscripts & Archives collections provide a rich vein of research material for the social historian comprising as it does of so many personal records in the form of private correspondence and personal diaries. Chief among the materials for the 18th century are the letters of the Bishop of Elphin Edward Synge to his daughter Alicia Synge, 1747-51 (MS 11566).

Listen back to Lyric FM\u2019s Easter Sunday documentary to hear more.\n\nIn the late 1990s Dr Marie-Louise Jennings presented to the Library a sheaf of letters which had been written by her ancestor, Bishop Edward Synge (1691-1762), in the middle of the eighteenth century. It is true that letters from wealthy men are the most frequent kind of correspondence which survives from the 1700s so this gift might not at first seem worth getting excited about. But it most definitely is. These letters are different. These are unparalleled in the Irish historical record because, in them, Bishop Synge \u2013 wonderfully, extraordinarily \u2013 was writing to his young daughter, Alicia. In the absence of her deceased mother, Synge was overseeing his daughter\u2019s life and education and, over the course of 221 letters, we can therefore watch an 18th-century girl grow up under the devoted, if imperious, care of a doting father. These letters prove intriguing to all who come to know about them, and radio producer Angie Mezzetti is only the most recent person to fall under their spell. Inspired by a lecture she heard, given to the Trinity Women Graduates Association (of which she was President), Mezzetti decided there and then to bring these letters to a wider audience. The fruit of her work, Saucy Mistress Boldface, was broadcast on Easter Sunday at 6pm on the Lyric Feature, RTE Lyric FM\u2019s weekly documentary slot.\n\nBishop Edward Synge\u2019s letter to his daughter Alicia, 28 July 1747\n\nPortrait of Edward Synge\u2019s father, the Archbishop of Tuam, 1738.

Actor Simon Coury reads Bishop Synge\u2019s letter of July 1746.\n\nBishop Synge lived with his daughter Alicia (b. 1733) in Kevin Street in Dublin; Alicia was the sole survivor of six siblings and her mother had died when she was about five years old. Every summer, the Bishop departed to live in Elphin, Co Roscommon, leaving Alicia at home in the company of her governess/companion Blandine Jourdan. Father and daughter wrote frequently, on average twice a week; lamentably, Alicia\u2019s letters to her father have not survived. The Bishop\u2019s main purpose was educational; literacy, and specifically letter-writing, was a business skill which he wanted his daughter to master. If, as was to be the case, Alicia Synge was to be the manager of a large house as an adult, she would need to be able to write, and write well, to conduct business and manage her affairs.\n\n\u2018To see you a valuable, accomplished woman will be the greatest joy and comfort\u2019. Actor Simon Coury reads Bishop Synge\u2019s letter of 21 July 1747.\n\nMost of the Bishop\u2019s letters begin with a comment or critique of the letter he had just received from Alicia (and the phrase \u2018Saucy Mistress Boldface\u2019 was one of his \u2018endearments\u2019 to her). Then he filled his pages with advice on absolutely everything which it would normally have fallen to a girl\u2019s mother to teach her, thereby allowing historians a priceless glimpse into private life in the 18th century.\n\nActor Simon Coury who brings the Bishop\u2019s letters to life in the documentary.\n\nDr Marie-Louise Jennings\u2019 edition of the Synge letters\n\nAngela Mezzetti, documentary maker and CEO Ocarina Productions\n\nAngie Mezzetti is a TCD alumnus, a radio documentary maker and media producer, who runs Ocarina Productions.

In 2018 she made Stranieri, a documentary about the immigrants who became the backbone of the RTE Symphony Orchestra. This was inspired by Professor Corinna Salvadori Lonergan, of Trinity\u2019s Department of Italian, whose parents came to Ireland to perform with the orchestra. Mezzetti also researched and produced the film All Changed, commissioned by the Trinity Centre for Gender Equality and Leadership in 2016. The film features several pioneering women academics who changed Trinity\u2019s patriarchal, gender-exclusive character.

Two days ago I received the book 'Hutchie \u2013 The Life and Works of Edward Hutchinson Synge (1890-1957)'. I learned a lot very quickly, and I'm delighted that we are having this symposium today devoted to the genius of Edward Hutchinson Synge, and to launch a book in his memory.\n\nAs most of you here will know, 'Hutchie' was the nephew of playwright John Millington Synge, and was the older brother of John Lighton Synge, the outstanding mathematician and theoretical physicist. It is my great privilege to welcome the members of the Synge family here today. I would like to extend a special welcome on behalf of the College to Professor Cathleen Synge Morawetz, niece of Edward Hutchinson, who is herself an eminent mathematician.\n\nYou will hear today of the life of this remarkable man, and I won't even attempt to sketch it here, except to say that EH Synge was a Foundation Scholar in mathematics at Trinity in 1910. However, he didn't graduate and he did his work as a recluse at his home in Dundrum.\n\nToday's symposium, almost a century after Edward Hutchinson Synge left Trinity, will shed some light on his remarkable scientific achievements and relatively unknown life in all its tragic complexity. I would like to welcome the guest speakers who are with us today to contribute to this process, particularly those who have travelled from the UK.\n\nI would like to thank the School of Physics for organising today's symposium. A huge thanks to Professors John Donegan, Denis Weaire and Petros Florides for organising the special commemorative publication. This book republishes the papers of EH Synge together with a short biographical memoir which for the first time provides some insight into his life. It is my pleasure to officially launch this book this morning.\n\nDuring a week when we remember those from past generations whose legacies have advanced Trinity's reputation in the world, it is very appropriate that we pay tribute to this unique person \u2013 this man whose headstone reads \u2018Scientist-Inventor\u2019. Indeed I think it says something about the immutability of Trinity's values that we still do things like this, and I feel everyone here is proud that we can raise EH Synge there alongside his brother, John Lighton Synge, and his hero William Rowan Hamilton whose life work he had been instrumental in having published.\n\nI now declare the symposium open and hope that you all enjoy this special programme of events to commemorate Edward Hutchinson Synge.\n\nSee addresses mainpage"}, {"url": "https://www.irishphilosophy.com/2014/01/27/synge-friend-and-father/", "page_content": "Edward Synge was born around 1690 and died in Dublin on the 27th January, 1762. He was the son of the elder Edward Synge, who was himself involved in the philosophical debates of the time.\n\nHe was educated in Trinity College Dublin (M.A. in 1712 and D.D. in 1728) and after being chancellor of St. Patrick\u2019s (1726), was successively bishop of Clonfert (1730), Cloyne (1731), Ferns (1733), and finally Elphin (1740 until his death).\n\nSynge was close to Francis Hutcheson and appears to have been a member of the Molesworth Circle. He assisted Hutcheson in developing revising his work and Hutcheson himself acknowledged that Synge had devised the general scheme of \u201cInquiry into Beauty and Virtue\u201d before Hutcheson. The connection seems to have continued after Hutcheson\u2019s departure for Glasgow and until his death, since his son dedicated the posthumous collection of his father\u2019s works to Synge . Letters from the 1760s from Edward Synge giving advice to the younger Hutcheson still exist.\n\n\n\nSynge was also friendly with George Berkeley who, like Hutcheson, was living in Dublin at the same time.\n\nDespite his connections, Synge\u2019s work in philosophy is minor, and is centred in the areas of moral and political philosophy. He argued for limited toleration (as his father before him had done), most notably in the sermon of 23rd October 1725 which he preached to the members of the House of Commons while prebendary of St Patricks. The sermon drew acclaim and was printed. It also drew vehement disagreement from the Church of Ireland vicar of Naas, Stephen Radcliffe, who wrote a 45 page pamphlet opposing the arguments of the sermon. Edward Synge wrote a vindication of his sermon in reply, along with a detailed outline of a possible oath that might be acceptable to Catholics\n\nStephen Radcliffe advocated using force against those who were unorthodox in their religious opinions. Synge argued that force ought not be used by magistrates against the religiously unorthodox \u201cif the publick civil interests are in no way affected\u201d, aligning himself with Locke (and Francis Hutcheson). Like Locke, however, while he says everyone has a right to worship according to his conscience, atheists are beyond the pale since their beliefs are destructive of society. But otherwise \u201call persons in a society, whose principles of religion have no tendency to hurt the public, have a right to a toleration.\u201d\n\nIn his reply to Radcliffe and following in his father\u2019s footsteps, Synge put forward his own version of an oath that might be acceptable to Catholics, and a proposal that the country accommodate 500 secular priests to serve the Catholic community. He made no other proposals regarding the Penal Laws, but noted that the limitations put on Catholic ownership of land meant they turned to trade, and held their wealth in money. Money was not as good a guarantor of their peaceful behaviour as money, and money could be used in revolt more readily\n\nSynge had six children, only one of whom, Alicia (1733-1807) survived into adulthood. Synge was widowed in 1737 and when he was promoted to Bishop of Elphin Alicia stayed in the family home in Kevin Street. Synge lived in Roscommon in the summer, and with her in Dublin for the parliamentary winter term. While separated he wrote her a series of letters, collected as The Synge Letters. Bishop Edward Synge to His Daughter Alicia, Roscommon to Dublin 1746-1752. Extracts have also been printed in the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing (extracts on google). These letters give insight into the paternal relationship to daughters, and education and care of girls in the 18th century.

In an astonishing paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy ( ... 1950) he was able, for the first time, to penetrate and explore in detail the region inside the Schwarzschild radius ( what we now call a black hole ) . At a time when many relativists thought that it did not even make sense to talk about this region, this work is very remarkable indeed.\n\n1972\n\n12\n\n1992\n\nEvery one of the other 88 % has been deeply influenced by his geometric vision and the clarity of his expression.\n\n200\n\n11\n\nEvery single book and every single paper is a remarkable work of art.\n\n1956\n\nIt is a remarkable fact that hardly a single space-time diagram is to be found in the standard texts on relativity before Synge's own presentation in 1956 .

L.'s lectures well remember the effectiveness with which they were delivered. J. L. was by no means inattentive to achieving such effectiveness. Once, upon opening a public lecture he posed the question, if I recall correctly, as to whether a scientific lecture is to be compared with a theatrical performance, a religious sermon or a circus.\n\n1943\n\n1961\n\n1964\n\n... a kind and generous man.

The origin of the name \"Synge\" is described in the introduction to General relativity : papers in honour of J L Synge :-John Synge's mother, Ellen Price, was of Scottish origin, being descended from the Scottish Stuarts, in particular a Sir William Stuart who went to Ireland in the early seventeenth century.After being educated at St Andrews College in Dublin, Synge entered Trinity College, Dublin in. There his achievements were quite remarkable, winning a Foundation Scholarship at the end of his first year. This scholarship was normally won by students in their third year of study. He was awarded his B.A. inin Mathematics and Experimental Physics. He received the Large Gold Medal for his outstanding work.After graduating, Synge was appointed to a lectureship in mathematics at Trinity College, but he only held the post for a short time, leaving for Canada in. fromtoSynge was an assistant professor of mathematics at the University of Toronto. Then inhe returned to Trinity College, Dublin where he was elected to a fellowship and also appointed to the chair of Natural Philosophythe older name for PhysicsInSynge headed back to North America and again was appointed to the University of Toronto, this time as Professor of Applied Mathematics. He spent some time inat Princeton University and, in, he was a visiting professor at Brown University. InSynge was appointed as Chairman of the Mathematics Department of Ohio State University, then, three years later, as Head of the Mathematics Department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburg. He also spent a short time as ballistic mathematician in the US Air Force duringInhe returned to Ireland to take up the post of Senior Professor in the School of Theoretical Physics of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. This School, which had been set up when the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies had been founded in, had several outstanding members including Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger who was also a Senior Professor.P S Floridesdescribes the range of topics that Synge worked on:-Synge's most important contributions to theoretical physics were, in many respects, the product of his great skill and insight as a geometer:-Synge retired inand during his time at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies about% of all workers in relativity theory studied there. Professor Hermann Bondi , who gave the first J L Synge Public Lecture in, remarked:-During his long scientific career, Synge published overpapers andbooks. Three of his books were aimed at providing an understanding of science to a wider audience and, with such a fine expository style, he was well suited to write such works. As Florides says in:-Synge's classic, written in, had a large influence:-The preface to thework contains the delightful thought:-Synge's skill at communication was not only a gift that he had for writing, but also a gift in lecturing. His son-in-law Douglas Dryer wrote:-Those who were fortunate enough to have attended Synge lectures say that he combined all three.Synge received many honours for his work. The greatest of these was probably his election as a fellow of the Royal Society of London in. He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and was president of the Royal Irish Academy fromtoHe is described inas:-As to hobbies, Synge was a keen cyclist, was passionately interested in sailing and painted some very fine compositions. In particular he painted a picture representing Schr\u00f6dinger held in the hand of God contemplating unified field theory.Synge was a member of a highly talented family. We mention three other members of the family. First John Millington Synge, John Lighton Synge's uncle, who was a playwright and a powerful poetic dramatist who portrayed the primitive life of the Aran Islands and the western Irish coast. Secondly there was Richard Laurence Millington Synge, Nobel laureate for Chemistry in, who shared the Prize for Chemistry with A J P Martin for their development of partition chromatography, a method used to separate mixtures of closely related chemicals such as amino acids for identification.

The initiative for this undertaking came from Sir Edward Stanhope, a Fellow of 1564\u201372, whose will, dated 28 February 1603, made very generous provision for the Library. Amongst other things Stanhope bequeathed \u00a320 for making and placing in the Library a large vellum register book which was to contain the names and arms of all the benefactors to the College and of its Masters. \u2018This Booke\u2019, he went on, \u2018must further bee kepte for the publike Register Booke of all the particular Bookes, Mapps, Globes ore other ornaments whatsoever belongenge or hereafter to beelonge to the saide Colledge Librarie.\u2019\n\nStanhope died in 1608, and the register book was duly written out and illuminated, probably following notes and sketches left by Stanhope himself. The scribe, it appears from the College accounts, was John Scott, who probably completed the first lists of benefactors, of Masters, and of donations to the Library between 1612 and 1614, at a cost, including a lavish binding, of about \u00a340. The Memoriale, as it was then named, continued in use until the 1670s, chiefly as a record of donations to the College Library, and it remains in the Library as MS R.17.8.\n\nThe heading of the section of the Memoriale which concerns the Library may be translated as follows:"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/edward.synge/2408126", "page_content": "Edward Synge\n\npriest\n\n1691 (age 71) County Cork\n\nHe was briefly Provost of Tuam and Chancellor of Street Patrick\"s Cathedral, Dublin, before he was nominated the Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh on 14 May 1730 and consecrated on 7 June 1730. He was subsequently translated to Cloyne on 22 March 1732, then to Ferns and Leighlin on 8 February 1734, and finally to Elphin on 15 May 1740. Synge\"s musical ability made a strong impression on Handel when the composer was in Dublin. Handel referred to Synge as \"a Nobleman very learned in Musick\". Synge was in attendance at the first performance of Handel\"s Messiah and his written comments on the performance are quoted in Richard Luckett\"s Handel\"s Messiah: a celebration (1992). These are principally taken up with advice to Alicia whom Mary Delany said was being \"brought up like a princess\". There is almost no aspect of the young girl\"s life upon which her father did not comment including dress, health, diet, exercise and behaviour in social situations. His principal concern was with her education generally and specifically her ability to write letters well. His advice to her on this score was to copy Swift for grammar and punctuation. These letters also provide valuable insight into domestic life and the lives of servants. The bequest of these letters to the Library of Trinity College, the University of Dublin, by Synge\"s descendant Marie-Louise Jenner, has revolutionised eighteenth-century Irish social and women\"s history.
