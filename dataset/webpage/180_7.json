This sparked many interesting debates about the merits of those that were on or those that were left off the list. While HSAC is not 75 years old (founded in 2006), this inspired us to examine the best basketball players of all-time. As the NBA media is about to reveal their First, Second, and Third Team selections for this season, we at HSAC will declare our own. But not for the past year \u2013 the past 40. We set out to create an NBA All-Decade team for each decade since the 1980s using a statistical approach and quantifiable metrics to back up our picks.\n\nMethodology\n\nWith the availability of many statistics, we tried to create a \u201ccatch-all\u201d metric showing how good each player was. Using z-scores, we compared where each player ranks in different widely available and \u201cimportant\u201d statistics separating by decade. Z-scores show how far a player\u2019s individual stat is from the average of the group and adjust for variation in the data. For example, consider two point guards, one who averaged 25 points per game in the 1980s and the other who averaged 30 points per game in the 2010s. Both were leading scorers in their time, so if you were to compare the 80s point guard with the modern one, his scoring would seem less impressive. This is a hypothetical situation, but the z-score allows us to compare across decades since it adjusts for certain eras being skewed towards certain statistics. As the NBA has changed over time (much higher scoring environment today), using z-scores allows us to compare within and across decades who were the best players. We implemented a similar approach looking at the best NFL quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers of all-time.\n\nWe selected our teams similar to All-NBA and All-Star team selections with two backcourt players (guards) and three frontcourt players (forwards and centers). For the backcourt, we computed a standardized z-score and then rescaled them from 0-100 for seven statistics (per game): 1) points, 2) assists, 3) rebounds, 4) steals, 5) win shares (an advanced metric that measures how much a player contributes to winning, 6) assist/turnover ratio, 7) true shooting percentage (shooting efficiency metric taking into account field goals, three-pointers, and free-throws). The previous stats are the same used for frontcourt players except substituting blocks for steals. From these seven standardized scores on a scale of 0-100, we computed a weighted average putting more stock in the \u201cprimary stats\u201d (points, assists, win shares, true shooting) than the secondary stats. We then ranked the players in each decade based on their weighted average scores to select a First, Second, and Third All-NBA team for each decade from 1980-2020.\n\nCaveats\n\nWhile we took a holistic approach to selecting our teams, there are other methods that would result in a different list. The seven statistics we chose are widely understood, recognized, and available metrics. Today, there are more advanced ones and some that rely on tracking data such as RAPM, DARKO, RAPTOR WAR, and more. Additionally, we did have a weighted criteria but one might choose different weights believing steals should be worth more. Facing a similar problem as modern day analytics, it is hard to quantify a player\u2019s defensive value and our statistical criteria focuses more on offensive than defensive production. Because we are using concrete statistical criteria, there will inevitably be players that rise higher on the list than expected due to putting up gaudy numbers in one area. This is not a \u201cbe-all and end-all\u201d list for the best basketball players of all-time but using a holistic and objective criteria to analyze and recognize the accomplishments of the best basketball players of all-time. We hope you enjoy reading through our teams and enjoy constructing your own based on our analysis.\n\n1st Team\n\nMagic Johnson (G) - 3x MVP, 5x Champion, 3x Finals MVP, 12x All-Star, 9x First Team\n\nThe leading point guard of the dynastic 1980\u2019s Los Angeles Lakers transcended the game of basketball making each game he played in an exciting piece of Hollywood entertainment. Some were skeptical of Johnson entering the league as 6\u20199\u2019\u2019 point guard in a game dominated by big post players. The No. 1 draft pick and NCAA Champion out of Michigan State proved them all wrong and is arguably the greatest point guard and passer of all-time. He averaged 11.2 assists per game over his career, the highest in history. In our analysis, he ranked first in win shares, points, and assists and second in true shooting percentage (behind Reggie Miller). Magic guided the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers to five of their 17 league-tying (with Celtics) NBA championships. The 1980\u2019s Lakers captivated NBA fans then and they still do today, with HBO\u2019s \u201cWinning Time: Rise of the Showtime Lakers\u201d based around Johnson\u2019s rise to fame. Today, Johnson is an activist, businessman, part team owner (Los Angeles Dodgers), but none of that will surpass his accomplishment as the greatest Laker and greatest point guard of all-time.\n\nMichael Jordan (G) - 5x MVP, 6x Champion, 6x Finals MVP, 14x All-Star, 10x First Team, Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that arguably two of the Top 5 five players of all-time are on the same team in the same position group and have the same initials. Jordan, synonymous as MJ, GOAT, Black Cat, Air Jordan, joins the 1980\u2019s first team even though he was just a rookie (of the year) in 1985. Jordan is considered the greatest because he is one of the best all-around players in history. With the analytics age, the debate over the best NBA players today usually boils down to volume and efficiency. Jordan epitomizes this perfect player. Jordan had a score of 70 or higher in five of our statistical categories, ranking the highest in points, steals, and blocks (speaking to his defensive prowess). The only areas where Jordan comes in below average for our sample is in assists and his assist to turnover ratio. Jordan was not a true point guard although he did handle the ball a lot he was usually the one putting it in the basket. Turnovers are often greater in the earlier years of a player\u2019s career (he averaged 3.3 per game in the 80s and then 2.4 in the 90s). Jordan never made it to an NBA championship in the first third of his career losing to the Detroit Pistons three consecutive times (1988-1990). Nevertheless, Jordan showed why he was the greatest player of all-time and would go on to win six NBA championships leading arguably the greatest basketball dynasty of all time. Similar to the other player with initials MJ on this list, off the court Jordan has made a career in Hollywood (Space Jam and The Last Dance) and owning a professional team (Charlotte Hornets).\n\nLarry Bird (F) - 3x MVP, 3x Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 12x All-Star, 9x First Team, Rookie of the Year\n\nAfter getting drafted sixth overall in 1978, Bird started cementing himself as arguably the best Celtic of all-time winning Rookie of the Year. Besides an injured season in \u201888-\u201989, he was selected to the All-Star team in every season of his legendary 13-year career. Bird brought three titles to Boston and ignited the legendary Celtics-Lakers rivalry whom they faced three times in the finals. He also had a personal rivalry with Magic Johnson who was drafted higher than him and defeated Bird and Indiana State in the NCAA championship. He will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest shooters of all time with a career field goal percentage of about 50% and a free throw percentage of 89%. However, it is not just his 24 points that sets him apart from the other all-star frontcourt players. Standing at 6\u20199\u2019\u2019, Bird went on to average ten rebounds, six assists, and close to two steals over the span of his career as one of the best point forwards of all-time.\n\nCharles Barkley (F) - MVP, 11x All-Star, 5x First Team\n\nCharles Barkley, Sir Charles, The Chuckster, The Prince of Pizza. It does not matter what nickname he may go by, The Leaning Tower of Pizza was likely the most dominant big man of the 1980s. Although he was drafted halfway through the decade \u2013 5th overall in 1984 out of Auburn \u2013 he immediately made his impact in a star-studded era. As All-Rookie, he was selected to 4 All-Star games in the 80s because of his supreme defensive and rebounding capabilities (league-high of 14.6 TRB in 86-87). He could also block shots with ease, possessed great dribbling abilities for his size, and shot the league high two-point percentages from \u201886 to \u201890, never falling below 63% inside the arc during that span. Barkley is one of the greatest players to never win a championship. He has a career playoff record of 62-61 and only failed to make the playoffs in two years of his career with the 76ers, Suns, and Rockets. Barkley remains a major figure in the basketball world due to his humorous off-court presence on TNT: Inside the NBA.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon (C) - MVP, 2x Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 12x All-Star, 6x First Team, 2x Defensive Player of the Year\n\nDrafted first overall in the legendary 1984 draft class (which also included Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton), the Nigerian legend will be known as one of the greatest big men of all-time, not just the 80s. Olajuwon is arguably one of the greatest defensive players of all-time. He led the league in both rebounds and blocked shots in 1989 and has a 97 rebound score and 85 block score in our metric. His rebounding and blocking skills are evident. But even for a seven footer, he could score at a consistently high rate \u2013 23.2 points per game in the 80s (score of 76). He managed to win back-to-back titles in 1994 and 1995 in an era dominated by Michael Jordan, the only two in Rockets franchise history.\n\n2nd Team\n\nJohn Stockton (G) - 10x All-Star, 2x First Team\n\nOf all NBA records, John Stockton\u2019s 15,806 assists is the least likely to ever fall. He ranks more than 3,000 ahead of second place Jason Kidd. The only active player remotely close, Chris Paul, has nearly 11,000. Paul would have to play 6 more full seasons averaging nearly 10 assists per game if he wanted to pass Stockton. At sixth on the list, Magic Johnson actually averaged more assists per game (11.2) than Stockton (10.5) but had a much shorter career (906 vs. 1504 games). One of Stockton\u2019s defining traits was his longevity and durability. He ranks fifth all-time in games played and in his first 13 seasons he only missed four games. In today\u2019s NBA landscape of \u201cload management\u201d, Stockton would be a unicorn. Stockton embodied peak efficiency posting high marks in assists (87), steals (82), true shooting (90), and assist to turnover ratio (95). The only knock on Stockton is that he was not an elite scorer (24). Stockton is the greatest Gonzaga player of all-time but they were not as dominant back in his day having never made the NCAA tournament in his time there. Stockton played all 20 years of his career with the Utah Jazz but is one of the greatest never to win a championship as he lost in the finals in back-to-back years to his first team contemporary, Michael Jordan.\n\nMaurice Cheeks (G) - 1x Champion, 4x All-Star\n\nMaurice Cheeks is probably the biggest surprise name to make this list. We know our criteria and methodology is not bulletproof so there are bound to be players that rise and others that fall more than expected. Nevertheless, Cheeks was an elite point guard. The reason why he rises on this list over Isaiah Thomas comes down to volume. Most would agree Thomas is the better point guard yet Cheeks\u2019s True Shooting score of 67 and Thomas\u2019s score of 25 likely put him over the edge. Although Thomas still has the higher score in points per game (54 vs 28), he was not as efficient. Cheeks only attempted around 9 field goals per game for most of the decade while Thomas averaged nearly double that (17) throughout the 80\u2019s. Cheeks, the current assistant coach for the Chicago Bulls, won his sole championship in 1983 with the 76ers in a sweep over the Lakers.\n\nMoses Malone (F/C) - 3x MVP, 1x Champion, 1x Finals MVP, 13x All-Star, 4x First Team\n\nMoses Malone was a defining piece of the 80s, as he only missed the All-Star game one year in the decade. His main attribute: rebounding. For five years straight in the 80s, Malone was the rebounding champ for the NBA. During that span, he averaged 14.3 rebounds. However, he was not just a glass cleaner as he also averaged 23.8 points, while nearly posting a 50% field goal percentage. Malone likely could be placed on the 1980s first team, but Hakeem\u2019s overload of defensive accolades and championship seasons beats him out. Nevertheless, Malone will go down as one of the most iconic faces of the decade who was fearless and could secure the ball with ease.\n\nKevin McHale (F) - 3x Champion, 7x All-Star, 1x First Team, 2x Sixth-Man\n\nOne of three Celtics front-court players to make the 1980\u2019s teams, Kevin McHale was a major contributor to the \u201881, \u201884, and \u201886 championship runs. McHale was a huge piece, averaging 16 points, 6 rebounds, and 2 blocks. A main reason why McHale has been named to the second team is his overall winning success. He has the 3rd best win shares for front court players, only behind teammate Larry Bird and fellow second team member Moses Malone. Additionally, Herman Munster was extremely efficient in the paint with a field goal percentage of 56.3%, while also posting an assist to turnover ratio of below 1. McHale would later coach the Timberwolves and the Rockets but could not capture the same postseason success that he had as a player.\n\nRobert Parish (C) - 4x Champion, 9x All-Star\n\nThe all-time leader in games played at 1,611, Robert Parish formed the most dominant front court in the 80\u2019s alongside Larry Bird and Kevin McHale, During this decade with the C\u2019s, Parish averaged 17.7 points, 16.4 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and had a 56% field goal percentage. Even though he is likely not the best Celtics big man of all-time (Bill Russel), he still holds many franchise records in blocked shots (1703), offensive rebounds (3450), and defensive rebounds (7601). He has been labeled as one of the league's most dominant centers who had an \u201cemotionless persona\u201d, which added to his winning mentality. Parish\u2019s game record might be in danger of falling to LeBron who trails him by 245. LeBron would have to play three entire seasons without missing a game so it will be close to call if Parish\u2019s record will stand.\n\n3rd Team\n\nIsiah Thomas (G) - 2x Champion, Finals MVP, 12x All-Star, 3x First Team\n\nIsiah Thomas is a midwest product. Originally from Chicago, Thomas attended Indiana University leading the Hoosiers to an NCAA championship in 1981. After being selected second overall by the Detroit Pistons, he spent his entire career with them to become their all-time leader in points, assists, steals, and games played. Nicknamed Zeke and Baby-Faced Assassin, Thomas was known for guiding the Pistons through an assertive brand of basketball earning them the nickname \u201cBad Boys.\u201d They made the playoffs consistently throughout the 80s, and won two NBA titles (1989 and 1990). In our analysis, he ranks third in assists per game earning a score of 81.This speaks to his ability to set up his teammates and his continued success as a leader in getting his team to the playoffs. Thomas is also known for his brief coaching stints with the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks, as well as being the first GM of the Toronto Raptors. Today, he is a broadcaster, analyst, and still a pivotal figure in Detroit Basketball as another aspiring point guard and last year\u2019s first overall draft selection, Cade Cunningham, tries to fill his shoes.\n\nClyde Drexler (G) - 1x Champion, 10x All-Star, 1x First Team)\n\nClyde Drexler was part of one of the most fun, acrobatic, and notable college basketball fraternities nicknamed Phi Slamma Jamma at the University of Houston with fellow 1st team selection Hakeem Olajuwon. Drexler led the Trail Blazers to their first NBA finals appearance losing to his back court running-mate Isiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons. He later was traded to the Rockets and reunited with Olajuwon where he won his first NBA championship (1995). Drexler excelled at the \u201chustle stats\u201d ranking top 5 in steals (78), blocks (64), and rebounds (78) for backcourt players. Speaking to his nickname, \u201cClyde the Glide\u201d participated in several dunk contests. Now, Drexler is a commissioner of the Big 3-on-3 basketball league and runs a family restaurant,\u201cDrexler's World Famous BBQ & Grill\u201d.\n\nKareem Abdul Jabbar (C) - 6x MVP, 6x Champion, 2x Finals MVP, 19x All-Star, 10x First Team, Rookie of the Year\n\nIt is surprising to see Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the third team rather than first team. Had we expanded our analysis to include a 1970s team, he would have been an easy selection for the 1st team. While Kareem was solid across the board, he didn\u2019t score above 65 in any of our seven metrics as his career was starting to decline in the latter half of the 80s. For example, he averaged nearly 24 points per game in the first three years of the decade while only 14 points in the last three years of his career. Born Ferdinand Lewis Alcindor Jr., which he later changed to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar when he converted to Islam, Kareem was known in the junior basketball circuits for his astonishing height at 6\u2019 8\u201d which he already reached in eighth grade. At UCLA, he grew to his final height of 7\u2019 2\u201d, and had an illustrious career winning three national players of the year and three NCAA Championships. Kareem was drafted 1st overall by the Milwaukee Bucks, and he already made an impact winning Rookie of the Year and leading a trip to the playoffs for a two year old team. After acquiring All-Star guard Oscar Robertson, the Bucks won their first (and only up until last year) championship in 1971. Kareem won both six NBA championships and six regular season MVPs, the most of any player. Throughout his career, he was known for his signature skyhook. Kareem currently holds the record for most regular-season points (38,387) but that is under threat of falling to LeBron James, continuing the Laker dominance in the record books. Of the Top 10 All-time leading scorers, seven have played for the Lakers (Kareem, LeBron, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Carmelo Anthony). Early on his career he received some criticism for being aloof due to his introverted nature towards the media and fans, but later on his fitness regime including yoga and his winning mentality were resounding. Now, he is known for being an activist and writer on issues about race and religion and a cultural ambassador.\n\nAlex English (F) - 8x All-Star\n\nThe current all-time leading scorer for the Denver Nuggets, Alex English, led them to nine consecutive playoff appearances. English, who played at the University of South Carolina, was a steal in the draft not selected until the second round by the Milwaukee Bucks. In our analysis, he ranked highly in win shares with a score of 61 showing his ability to lead his team to the playoffs as he brought the Nuggets past the first round more times than in the 30 seasons after he retired. Most famously, English was known for his finesse and his ability to cut, earning him the nickname \u201cThe Blade\u201d, which is further supported by his high score in the points category of 87. When he retired, he was the holder for most points, assists, games, and minutes of any player in a Nuggets uniform. While some of his Nuggets records might be at the threat of falling to Nikola Jokic, there is no doubt that English is one of the greatest Nuggets ever.\n\nLarry Nance (F) - 3x All-Star\n\nLarry Nance was catapulted into fame by being the first winner of the NBA Dunk Contest in 1984 playing for the Phoenix Suns. He was already known for his ability to play both ends of the court by being the lead shot blocker of any player other than a center when he retired. Our analysis confirms Nance\u2019s ability to be versatile as he received medium to high scores in most categories and only dipped below 50 (league average) in assists. Nance was a huge part of the late 80s and early 90s competitive Cavaliers team whom his son Larry Nance Jr. used to play for.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nFat Lever (G), Sidney Moncrief (G), Julius Erving (F), Adrian Dantley (F), Jack Sikma (C)\n\nCheck out our 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s teams\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/5-greatest-perimeter-defenders-nba-history", "page_content": "Perimeter defending in the NBA isn't an easy task, especially with players constantly evolving their approach to the game offensively.\n\nVery few players have the footwork, hustle, reaction time and basketball IQ to be the perfect perimeter defender. More often than not, though, their work goes unnoticed. Perimeter defenders are rarely considered in the reckoning for the Defensive Player of the Year award.\n\nBut that trend might soon change. Players like Jimmy Butler, Ben Simmons and Jrue Holiday, to name a few, are some of the elite defenders in the game and are finally getting the appreciation they rightfully deserve.\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nThe players mentioned above are rising up the ladder to become some of the best. However, they still have to achieve a significant body of work before they can challenge some of the greatest perimeter defenders.\n\nOn that note, let's look at the greatest perimeter defenders in NBA history.\n\nThe best perimeter defenders in NBA history\n\n#5 Kawhi Leonard\n\nKawhi Leonard\n\nKawhi Leonard continues to increase his standing as one of the greatest defenders to play the game. The \"Klaw\" started his league career primarily as a defender before turning himself into one of the best two-way players in the NBA.\n\nKawhi has made three All-NBA defensive first and second teams each. He has also won two back-to-back Defensive Player of the Year awards. He led the league in steals in 2015, tallying 148 in 64 games, averaging 2.31 per game.\n\nHis ability to catch players off-guard, fundamentals and his incredible wing-span and long hands make him a lethal defensive player on the perimeter. It also allows him to guard players of all sizes and use his defensive reactions in the best way possible. Kawhi's ability to read plays and come up clutch on the defensive end will surely rank him as an all-time top-three defender when he decides to call time on his career.\n\n#4 Chris Paul\n\nChris Paul #3 of the Phoenix Suns in action\n\nChris Paul is one of the most intelligent players to have played in the NBA. His ability to organize his team on both ends of the floor is still as effective as when he made his debut in 2005.\n\nCP3 has averaged 2 steals per contest in his career. Despite being a diminutive figure, he has used his high basketball IQ in the most effective way possible. The way he takes the physical challenge against younger point guards even at 36 years of age is still remarkable. His reading of the game enables him to be one of the best perimeter defenders in the NBA.\n\nPaul's defensive prowess has earned him seven All-Defensive first-teams and two All-Defensive second-team selections. The \"Point-God\" has led the league in steals six times and is fifth on the all-time steals leaders in the NBA (2,330 steals).\n\n#3 Michael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nMichael Jordan was appreciated for his unparalleled offensive game, but that doesn't change the fact that he was one of the most fierce perimeter defenders of all time. Jordan was aggressive, fast, and a physically dominant player in his prime.\n\nMuch like all the players mentioned on this list, Jordan was a great student of the game. He knew how his opponents played individually and as a team, which allowed him to dominate them on both ends of the floor.\n\nMichael Jordan won the NBA DPOY award in 1988 and earned nine straight All-Defensive First Team selections. He also led the league thrice in steals. He is currently number three on the all-time list for most steals made by a player in the NBA (2,514).\n\n#2 Scottie Pippen\n\nScottie Pippen\n\nRegarded as Michael Jordan's \"sidekick,\" Scottie Pippen was a beast on the defensive end. He was often tasked with guarding the opponent's top scorer and, more often than not, was highly successful in limiting them.\n\nScottie Pippen had the size, strength, footwork and all other defensive attributes to be a solid perimeter stopper. Like Jordan, Pippen was a great reader of the game and his opponents, giving him the upper hand while guarding them in crunch situations.\n\nAlthough Pippen was always regarded as one of the best defensive players of his time, he never won the Defensive Player of the Year award. Nonetheless, he earned eight NBA All-Defensive first teams and two All-Defensive second-team selections in a ten-year span. He has 2,307 career steals, the seventh-highest in NBA history.\n\n#1 Gary Payton\n\nGary Payton\n\nGary Payton, to date, is regarded as one of the best perimeter defenders in NBA history. The former Seattle Supersonics guard was bold and never shied away from challenging the best player on the opposition team. A prime example is when he took on the challenge of guarding Michael Jordan during the 1996 NBA finals.\n\nFew players stood up to Jordan in his prime. However, not only did Payton take up the challenge, but he was also successful in his own right. Payton wasn't assigned to guard MJ in the first three games of the finals series, which the Bulls won comfortably.\n\nHowever, in the next three games, Payton was tasked with limiting Jordan and he did so with great effect, with the Sonics winning two of the three games. Payton's team eventually lost game six of the finals and, therefore, the series.\n\n1996 NBA FinalsMJ not guarded by GP:- 3 games- 31.0 PPG- 5.0 APG- 46.0 FG%- 50.0 3P%MJ guarded by GP:- 3 games- 23.7 PPG- 3.3 APG- 36.7 FG%- 11.1 3P%#TheLastDance pic.twitter.com/Lj38Vt4WJ5 \u2014 StatMuse (@statmuse) May 11, 2020\n\nGary Payton won his only Defensive Player of the Year award the same year while leading the league in steals (235 steals, 2.8 per game). He also made nine straight All-Defensive First teams between 1994 and 2002. He ranks fourth on all-time steals in the NBA, with 2,445 to his name.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/5-nba-players-all-defensive-team-selections", "page_content": "Defense is as important in the game of basketball as a great offense, and we have seen some NBA superstars that have been able to perform at a high level on both sides. Two All-Defensive teams are picked at the end of every NBA season to select the best defenders of the campaign.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at the five players with the most appearances in the NBA All-Defensive teams.\n\n5 Players with the most All-Defensive selections\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nSome defensive specialists have been rewarded with All-Defensive selections. However, this list is made up of NBA superstars who performed exceptionally on defense, while contributing significantly on the other end of the floor as well.\n\n#5 Scottie Pippen - 10 NBA All-Defensive selections\n\nScottie Pippen.\n\nScottie Pippen is one of the greatest wing defenders in NBA history. He was Michael Jordan's main ally during the Chicago Bulls' run of six NBA titles during the 1990s, and his defense was stifling throughout.\n\nAlso Read: Michael Jordan\u2019s net worth, salary, endorsements and more\n\nThe 6' 8'' forward came into the league in the 1987 NBA Draft, when he was selected by the Seattle Supersonics with the fifth pick, before being traded to the Bulls.\n\nPippen did not start a single game in his first NBA season, but still showed his defense was good, recording 1.2 steals in just over 20 minutes per game.\n\nFrom his second season onwards, Pippen became a regular starter and one of the two best players on the Chicago Bulls' roster. Moreover, he quickly became one of the best defenders in the league.\n\nAt the end of his career, he had six NBA championships, an All-Star Game MVP, seven All-NBA selections, and his defense had earned him 10 All-Defensive selections. He was a member of the All-Defensive First Team eight times and was selected to the Second-Team twice.\n\nPippen averaged two steals per game in his career and led the league in that category once (1994-95 with 2.9 per game).\n\n#4 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - 11 NBA All-Defensive selections\n\nKareem was unstoppable.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar will always be known for his offense. He popularized the unstoppable skyhook, and his record of 38,387 points is the highest in NBA history.\n\nHowever, at 7' 2'', Abdul-Jabbar was also an elite rim protector and a huge presence in the middle for the Milwaukee Bucks' and LA Lakers' defenses between 1969 and 1989.\n\nHis frame helped him lead the league in blocks four times in his career, even though the league started tracking the stat in the 1973-74 season, which was Kareem's fifth year in the NBA.\n\nHis defense earned Kareem 11 All-Defensive selections (five First-Team and six Second-Team choices). In his 20-year career, Abdul-Jabbar won six NBA titles, six MVPs, two Finals MVPs, and received 19 All-Star selections.\n\nAlso Read: Michael Jordan\u2019s net worth, salary, endorsements and more\n\n#3 Kobe Bryant - 12 NBA All-Defensive selections\n\nIndiana Pacers v Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nOne of the greatest players in NBA history, Kobe Bryant, did not become an NBA legend only due to his dominant offense. Bryant's defensive effort was always a challenge he accepted and excelled at.\n\nIn his 20-year NBA career, Bryant earned 12 NBA All-Defensive selections (nine First-Team and three Second-Team choices). His 12 All-Defensive selections are tied for second-most in NBA history. Also, Bryant earned one league MVP and 15 All-NBA choices (tied for second-most too).\n\nBryant won five NBA championships with the LA Lakers, two Finals MVPs, two scoring titles, four All-Star Game MVPs, and a couple of scoring titles.\n\n#2 Kevin Garnett - 12 NBA All-Defensive selections\n\nBoston Celtics v New York Knicks.\n\n'The Big Ticket' is tied with Kobe Bryant for second place in most NBA All-Defensive selections. However, Kevin Garnett won the Defensive Player of the Year award after the 2007-08 season, and it will be used as a tiebreaker in this list.\n\nGarnett's 12 NBA All-Defensive selections are constructed by nine First-Team appearances and three Second-Team choices. At 6' 11'', Garnett was a versatile defender who could defend the paint and act as the anchor of the defense while matching up with smaller players at any time.\n\nGarnett's vocal leadership worked wonders on defense, and he was an essential part of the Boston Celtics' NBA Championship win in 2008.\n\nMoreover, Garnett won one league MVP (one of five players to win MVP and DPOY), an All-Star Game MVP, four rebounding titles, and earned 15 All-Star selections.\n\n#1 Tim Duncan - 15 NBA All-Defensive selections\n\nSan Antonio Spurs v Atlanta Hawks.\n\nTim Duncan might have a good case for the GOAT debate if any San Antonio Spurs fan wants to put effort into that argument. Not only is he the greatest Power Forward in the history of the NBA, but Duncan was one of the greatest team leaders the league has seen.\n\nAlong with his offense, Duncan was an elite defender and is arguably the best defender to not win a Defensive Player of the Year award. TD earned a record 15 NBA All-Defensive selections (eight First-Team and seven Second-Team choices) and was one of the league's best defenders in almost every year of his illustrious career.\n\nDuncan won five NBA titles with the Spurs, three Finals MVPs, two regular-season MVPs, and earned 15 All-NBA selections.\n\nHis career Defensive Rating is an impressive 96 (third-best in NBA history), and he led the league in Defensive Rating four times.\n\nAlso read: What channel is Indiana Pacers vs Golden State Warriors on tonight?

Offense sells tickets, but defense wins championships. Legendary college football coach Bear Bryant said those words about the gridiron, but they apply to the basketball hardwood, too. Offense and lots of points can be exciting, but the nuts and bolts of a great team is a commitment on the defensive end of the court. That has changed more in the current NBA, but of the last 22 NBA champions (through 2020), all but two of them ranked in the top 10 in opponent's field-goal percentage. Six of those champions had the lowest opponent\u2019s field-goal percentage, and all 22 were better than league average in that defensive statistic. Still, you don\u2019t have to be an NBA champion to be a great defensive team. Some great defensive squads don't even make the playoffs. These are the greatest defensive teams in NBA history. Note: The rankings take into account traditional stats, advanced stats, individual players and defensive schemes.\n\n30. 1993-94 New York Knicks It was no fun to play against the 1994 Knicks. Record: 57-25 (.695 winning percentage), first place in Atlantic Division Points allowed: 91.5 per game Blocks: 4.7 per game Steals: 9.2 per game Defensive rebounds: 31.0 per game Finish: Lost NBA Finals (4-3) against Houston Rockets\n\nBottom Line: 1993-94 New York Knicks There's nowhere to go. Pat Riley made his name as a coach with the flashy Showtime Lakers, but he really preferred a rough and rugged style, and no team epitomized that more than the 1994 Knicks. The mere mention of their front line of Patrick Ewing, Charles Oakley and Anthony Mason gives many mid-90s big men chills. Those three didn\u2019t just look tough. They were tough. With intimidation, intellect and ability, the Knicks allowed the fewest points per game that season, 91.5. That was 4.3 fewer points than the second-best team, the Spurs, who allowed 94.8 points. That's impressive.\n\n29. 1977-78 Phoenix Suns These Suns put the squeeze on a lot of opponents. Record: 49-33 (.598 winning percentage), second place in Pacific Division Points allowed: 108.6 per game Blocks: 4.5 per game Steals: 12.9 per game Defensive rebounds: 31.5 per game Finish: Lost Western Conference first round (2-0) against Milwaukee Bucks\n\nBottom Line: 1977-78 Phoenix Suns The Phoenix Suns have never won an NBA championship. General manager Jerry Colangelo had a specific vision in mind when he constructed the 1977-78 Suns team, and the team played exactly as he envisioned. The Suns didn\u2019t have a single player in their 30s, and five of the 12 players on the team were rookies, which meant lots of boundless energy that could be applied on the court. That energy manifested itself into a frenzied defensive style in which Suns would pressure opposing players into making mistakes and committing turnovers. The Suns not only led the league in steals, but their average of 12.9 per game also remains an all-time NBA record over 40 years later. Backup point guard Ron Lee led the league in steals while starting point Don Buse finished fifth as the top six players for the Suns collected more steals than all but one other NBA team.\n\n28. 1999-00 Los Angeles Lakers Shaq rejected a lot of shots. Record: 67-15 (.817 winning percentage), first place in Pacific Division Points allowed: 92.3 per game Blocks: 6.5 per game Steals: 7.5 per game Defensive rebounds: 33.4 per game Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-2) against Indiana Pacers\n\nBottom Line: 1999-00 Los Angeles Lakers Kobe Bryant was a great defensive player. Phil Jackson joined the Kobe-Shaq Lakers in this season, and outside of the triangle offense, Jackson\u2019s biggest impact was an increased focus on rebounding the ball. The Lakers led the league in both total rebounds and defensive rebounds after finishing middle-of-the-pack in both stats the year before. Sometimes a shift in focus is all it takes. The Lakers didn\u2019t change personnel in regards to their roster. Their top seven players in minutes played from the previous season returned. But more of an emphasis on rebounding led to more possessions for Shaq and Kobe, which led to the first Lakers championship in a dozen years.\n\n27. 1974-75 Washington Bullets Elvin Hayes patrolled the paint for the Washington Bullets. Record: 60-22 (.732 winning percentage), first place in Central Division Points allowed: 97.5 per game Blocks: 5.0 per game Steals: 11.3 per game Defensive rebounds: 33.7 per game Finish: Lost NBA Finals (4-0) against Golden State Warriors\n\nBottom Line: 1974-75 Washington Bullets Wes Unseld was a tough defender. When you have one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history on your team, then you can be assured that board work will be prioritized. When you have two of the greatest board men ever, then you build an NBA Finals team like the 1975 Bullets. Their big man combo of Elvin Hayes and Wes Unseld featured two guys who currently rank fourth and 12th, respectively, in career rebounds. That duo was the catalyst for preventing offensive rebounds and close-range second opportunities. The Bullets limited opponents to 43.8 percent from the field which led the NBA and helped propel the team to their most wins (60) in franchise history.\n\n26. 2013-14 Indiana Pacers We'll take that. Record: 56-26 (.683 winning percentage), first place in Central Division Points allowed: 92.3 per game Blocks: 5.4 per game Steals: 6.7 per game Defensive rebounds: 34.5 per game Finish: Lost Eastern Conference finals (4-2) against Miami Heat\n\nBottom Line: 2013-14 Indiana Pacers Take that. A forgotten team because they were never able to get over the hump of LeBron and the Miami Heat, the 2014 Pacers team had everything required to be elite defensively. They had length on the perimeter with George Hill and Paul George, toughness with Lance Stephenson and David West, and a deterrent in the middle with Roy Hibbert. This team also had continuity. Those five players started 73 of the 82 games, which helps in knowing the tendencies of your teammates. These Pacers lacked depth beyond the starting five, which is why they\u2019re ranked so low on this list, but you would be hard-pressed to find a better five-man defensive unit in recent NBA history.\n\n25. 1989-90 Detroit Pistons Dennis Rodman was a vital piece of the \"Bad Boy\" Pistons. Record: 59-23 (.720 winning percentage) first place in Central Division Points allowed: 98.3 per game Blocks: 5.1 per game Steals: 6.2 per game Defensive rebounds: 30.0 per game Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-1) against Portland Trail Blazers\n\nBottom Line: 1989-90 Detroit Pistons Bad Boys, Bad Boys. What you gonna do? What you gonna do when they come for you? In the \"Bad Boys\" era of the Pistons, this 1990 unit was the best of the bunch. It was led by Dennis Rodman, who won the Defensive Player of the Year award. The Pistons started the season a little flat after winning the title the previous year, but inserting Rodman into the starting lineup made all of the difference in the world. Detroit went 26-13 with Rodman off the bench and 33-10 with him as a starter. His energy was infectious. He could guard 1-5 back in those days, and he was the catalyst that helped the Pistons limit opponents to the worst field goal percentage in the league.\n\n24. 1980-81 Phoenix Suns The Suns swarmed opponents. Record: 57-25 (.695 winning percentage), first place in Pacific Division Points allowed: 104.5 per game Blocks: 5.1 per game Steals: 10.7 per game Defensive rebounds: 30.4 per game Finish: Lost Western Conference semifinals (4-3) against Kansas City Kings\n\nBottom Line: 1980-81 Phoenix Suns Alvan Adams spent his entire career with the Phoenix Suns. Sometimes one player can make all the difference in the world, both on the court and off the court. For the 1981 Suns, that player was Dennis Johnson, who was acquired via trade for fellow Hall of Famer Paul Westphal. DJ was known for his tough-nosed defense. He is the NBA\u2019s all-time leading shot blocker amongst point guards and was selected to nine All-Defensive teams. But Johnson was also known for his leadership, and he got his new Suns teammates to buy into that end of the court. Westphal was a brilliant offensive player, but he made no impact defensively. The SuperSonics team he was traded to got worse defensively with both his addition and Johnson\u2019s subtraction.\n\n23. 2014-15 Golden State Warriors The Warriors could play defense, too. Record: 67-15 (.817 winning percentage), first place in Pacific Division Points allowed: 99.9 per game Blocks: 6.0 per game Steals: 9.3 per game Defensive rebounds: 34.3 per game Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-2) against Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nBottom Line: 2014-15 Golden State Warriors Dub life. Of the recent Warriors\u2019 five-year dynasty, this unit was the best defensive team as it consisted of familiar names (minus Kevin Durant) but was loaded with depth. Whenever you bring up the Splash Brothers era of the Warriors, everyone usually focuses on the offense, but they actually finished with the best defensive rating in the league compared with the second-best offensive rating. The Warriors\u2019 famed \"Lineup of Death\" was nicknamed that for a reason. It featured similarly sized players who all had the ability to switch on the perimeter. Everyone on the court could stay in front of their man and contest jumpers and that allowed Golden State to hold opponents to the lowest field goal percentage in the league.\n\n22. 1977-78 New Jersey Nets Bad teams can play defense. Record: 24-58 (.293 winning percentage), fifth place in Atlantic Division Points allowed: 112.5 per game Blocks: 7.7 per game Steals: 10.5 per game Defensive rebounds: 31.6 per game Finish: Did not make playoffs\n\nBottom Line: 1977-78 New Jersey Nets Steals and blocks were the Nets' specialty. This might be the worst great defensive team in NBA history. The Nets finished 24-58 thanks to a last-ranked offense, and their defense was solid at seventh-best though not elite. But what earns their placement on this list was their uncanny ability to rack up, as Bill Simmons calls them, stocks (steals and blocks). These woeful, cellar-dweller Nets are the only team in NBA history to average at least 10.5 steals and 7.5 blocks per game. When this season was over, the Nets ranked 16th all-time in steals for a single-season while also ranking second all-time in blocks. No other team in NBA history has reached both of those thresholds in a single season.\n\n21. 2018-19 Milwaukee Bucks The Bucks stopped a lot of teams. Record: 60-22 (.732 winning percentage), first place in Central Division Points allowed: 109.3 per game Blocks: 5.9 per game Steals: 7.5 per game Defensive rebounds: 40.4 per game Finish: Lost Eastern Conference finals (4-2) against Toronto Raptors\n\nBottom Line: 2018-19 Milwaukee Bucks The 2019 Bucks lost in the Eastern Conference finals. The stats for these Bucks highlight the difference between points allowed per game and defensive rating, which is points allowed per 100 possessions. Due to their second-ranked pace, the Bucks ranked 11th in points allowed, but when every team is compared on 100 possessions, the Bucks led the league in defensive rating. A big reason for their lofty defensive rating was them limiting opponents to only one shot. The Bucks led the NBA in both total rebounds and defensive rebounds so a missed shot usually ended up in one of their players' hands instead of resulting in an offensive rebound. You can\u2019t score if you don\u2019t have the ball and these Bucks excelled at limiting additional possessions.\n\n20. 1991-92 Chicago Bulls Lockdown. Record: 67-15 (.817 winning percentage), first place in Central Division Points allowed: 99.5 per game Blocks: 5.9 per game Steals: 8.2 per game Defensive rebounds: 29.7 per game Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-2) against Portland Trail Blazers\n\nBottom Line: 1991-92 Chicago Bulls Horace Grant was a force on the Bulls. The Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen combo is perhaps the greatest perimeter defensive duo in NBA history. This team featured that duo at their athletic primes along with power forward Horace Grant. The Bulls didn\u2019t rank in the top 10 in either steals or blocks, but there was no one better in terms of man-to-man defense. They also played their best when it mattered most, slashing their points allowed average from 99.5 in the regular season to 94.2 in the postseason.\n\n19. 1968-69 Boston Celtics There's a reason Bill Russell won all those rings. Record: 48-34 (.585 winning percentage), fourth place in Eastern Division Points allowed: 105.4 per game Blocks: N/A Steals: N/A Defensive rebounds: N/A Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-3) against Los Angeles Lakers\n\nBottom Line: 1968-69 Boston Celtics The 1969 Celtics won the NBA championship. This was Bill Russell\u2019s final season and the last of his 11 championship-winning seasons. Russell was also the coach, so he had many responsibilities, but Red Auerbach eased some of the burden on him by scaling back his role on offense. That allowed Russell to do what he did best, which was play defense. The Celtics had a subpar regular season in which they won their fewest games in 12 years, but they turned things up in the postseason. Russell went toe-to-toe with big men Willis Reed of the Knicks and Wilt Chamberlain of the Lakers and thwarted their efforts to end the Celtics dynasty. Russell grabbed 21 rebounds in his final game as the Celtics became the first team to win an NBA Finals Game 7 on the road.\n\n18. 1951-52 Minneapolis Lakers George Mikan was the NBA's first big star. Record: 40-26 (.606 winning percentage), second place in Western Division Points allowed: 79.5 per game Blocks: N/A Steals: N/A Defensive rebounds: N/A Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-3) against New York Knicks\n\nBottom Line: 1951-52 Minneapolis Lakers The Lakers started in Minneapolis and were named after ships on the Great Lakes known as Lakers, which were unique ships with a long cargo hold. We go way back to before the implementation of the shot clock to acknowledge the Lakers. This defense was built around the NBA\u2019s first great big man in George Mikan, who was both tall and athletic while many other players of that time were one or the other. Mikan controlled the paint on both ends of the court so much that the NBA made a rule change and widened the paint from six feet to 12 feet before this season. That led to players not even challenging Mikan and instead settling for unfamiliar jump shots, which played right into the Lakers\u2019 game plan and they allowed no easy baskets with Mikan in the middle.\n\n17. 2008-09 Orlando Magic Dwight Howard protected the rim with the Magic. Record: 59-23 (.720 winning percentage), first place in Southeast Division Points allowed: 94.4 per game Blocks: 5.4 per game Steals: 7.0 per game Defensive rebounds: 33.3 per game Finish: Lost NBA Finals (4-1) against Los Angeles Lakers\n\nBottom Line: 2008-09 Orlando Magic Not today. More than getting lots of blocks and steals, the best thing a good defense does is forcing the opponent to take and make difficult shots. That is manifested in opposing field goal percentage, and the Magic ranked in the top three in opposing two-point percentage, three-point percentage and overall percentage. They were so good that they even had a great free-throw defense, and opponents had the third-worst free-throw percentage. The catalyst for that (well, not the free-throw defense) was Dwight Howard, who led the league in rebounds and blocks on his way to the first of three Defensive Player of the Year awards.\n\n16. 1998-99 Atlanta Hawks Nope. Record: 31-19 (.620 winning percentage), second place in Central Division Points allowed: 83.4 per game Blocks: 5.2 per game Steals: 6.9 per game Defensive rebounds: 30.0 per game Finish: Lost Eastern Conference semifinals (4-0) against New York Knicks\n\nBottom Line: 1998-99 Atlanta Hawks Can you deal with pressure? Most teams on this list are built around great team defenses, but the 1999 Hawks\u2019 placement is really all about two players: Mookie Blaylock and Dikembe Mutombo. Blaylock was the two-time reigning steals champion and made his sixth straight All-Defensive team this season. Mutombo controlled the paint and was the two-time reigning Defensive Player of the Year who finished in the top four in both rebounds and blocks. Pretty much everyone else on the team was average at best on defense, but those two alone allowed the Hawks to allow the fewest points in the league during the lockout-shortened 1998-99 season.\n\n15. 1985-86 Washington Bullets Manute Bol was tough to shoot over at 7-foot-7. Record: 39-43 (.476 winning percentage), third place in Atlantic Division Points allowed: 104.8 per game Blocks: 8.7 per game Steals: 7.6 per game Defensive rebounds: 29.7 per game Finish: Lost Eastern Conference first round (3-2) against Philadelphia 76ers\n\nBottom Line: 1985-86 Washington Bullets Block party. These Bullets weren\u2019t the best team in the world. Look at their losing record. But they were the best at one specific thing: blocking shots. They blocked more shots in a single season than any other team in NBA history thanks to a 7-foot-7-inch rookie named Manute Bol. Bol alone blocked more shots (397) than 11 NBA teams, and he was at his athletic prime as injuries would hamper him thereafter. His mere presence forced opponents to second-guess coming into the lane, which then led to tougher, outside shots. Because of that, opponents shot just 47.4 percent on two-point attempts, the second-worst in the NBA.\n\n14. 2012-13 Memphis Grizzlies Marc Gasol made it tough for opponents to score in the paint. Record: 56-26 (.683 winning percentage), second place in Southwest Division Points allowed: 89.3 per game Blocks: 5.3 per game Steals: 8.6 per game Defensive rebounds: 29.8 per game Finish: Lost Western Conference finals (4-0) against San Antonio Spurs\n\nBottom Line: 2012-13 Memphis Grizzlies I don't think so. The Grizzlies\u2019 Grit and Grind era was known for their tough-nosed defensive units, and this team was the best of that bunch. They had four players in their starting lineup that were either past or future All-Defensive selections, but team defense was their calling card. Center Marc Gasol was the conductor of this great unit and was considered the best in his league at calling out defensive assignments and switches for teammates on the perimeter. Gasol was also great individually and allowed just 0.76 points per play as an on-ball defender, which was the best in the league. For his efforts, he was named the 2012-13 Defensive Player of the Year.\n\n13. 1982-83 New Jersey Nets Buck Williams helped the Nets collect a lot of rebounds. Record: 49-33 (.598 winning percentage), third place in Atlantic Division Points allowed: 103.0 per game Blocks: 7.2 per game Steals: 11.1 per game Defensive rebounds: 29.6 per game Finish: Lost Eastern Conference first round (2-0) against New York Knicks\n\nBottom Line: 1982-83 New Jersey Nets Quick hands. This team is best known for coach Larry Brown resigning two weeks before the playoffs after accepting a job at Kansas. But for the duration of the season, Brown built a ferocious defensive team that led the league in forcing turnovers. The Nets ranked first in the league in steals and third in blocks as they could play many different styles. They were a good defensive team, which then became a great one when they traded for Michael Ray Richardson just before the trade deadline. Richardson led the NBA in steals per game this season and set the tone for the rest of the season by nabbing six steals in his first start as a Net.\n\n12. 1996-97 Miami Heat Are you ready to battle? Record: 61-21 (.744 winning percentage), first place in Atlantic Division Points allowed: 89.3 per game Blocks: 5.4 per game Steals: 7.9 per game Defensive rebounds: 29.3 per game Finish: Lost Eastern Conference finals (4-1) against Chicago Bulls\n\nBottom Line: 1996-97 Miami Heat The Heat were an intimidating team led by Alonzo Mourning in the middle. Pat Riley constructed his early Miami Heat teams similarly to how he did his Knicks teams. That meant they were big, physical teams that had a habit of wearing teams down late in games. This Heat squad had an intimidating front line of Jamal Mashburn, P.J. Brown and Alonzo Mourning, all of whom were at least 240 pounds. Miami didn\u2019t rank in the top five in either blocks or steals, but they ranked second in opposing field goal percentage (43.2 percent). With their size and length, they simply made it difficult for opponents to get easy baskets and it showed as 71 of their 82 opponents were kept under 100 points.\n\n11. 1969-70 New York Knicks Where do you think you're going? Record: 60-22 (.732 winning percentage), first place in Eastern Division Points allowed: 105.9 per game Blocks: N/A Steals: N/A Defensive rebounds: N/A Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-3) against Los Angeles Lakers\n\nBottom Line: 1969-70 New York Knicks Walt Frazier helped the Knicks win their first NBA title in 1970. Like all Red Holzman-coached teams, the Knicks were known as a great passing team that was fun to watch. Watching great defense isn\u2019t always fun, but these Knicks brought it on that end of the court as well with point guard Walt Frazier as the head of the snake. Frazier is considered by many to be the greatest defensive point guard of all time, and he would harass opposing ballhandlers all over the court before picking their pockets. His defense against future backcourt-mate Earl Monroe along with Jerry West in the playoffs enabled the Knicks to win their first NBA championship.\n\n10. 1993-94 Seattle Supersonics The Glove showed no love to the other team. Record: 63-19 (.768 winning percentage), first place in Pacific Division Points allowed: 96.9 per game Blocks: 4.5 per game Steals: 12.8 per game Defensive rebounds: 27.2 per game Finish: Lost Western Conference first round (3-2) against Denver Nuggets\n\nBottom Line: 1993-94 Seattle Supersonics The game used to be more physical. This might be a foul in today's NBA. Just like in football, in basketball turnovers are often the biggest predictor of success. Creating more turnovers means more possessions for your team, which equates to more points scored. The SuperSonics had supersonic speed on the defensive end and created more turnovers than any other team in the 1993-94 season. The catalysts for that were their two All-Defensive selection point guards in Gary Payton and Nate McMillan, who combined to average nearly 5.5 steals per game. Whether it was hounding opposing point guards, jumping passing lanes or stripping big men in the post, those two set the tone for this Seattle team. Until they became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 8 seed in the playoffs.\n\n9. 1981-82 Milwaukee Bucks There's no daylight. Record: 55-27 (.671 winning percentage), first place in Central Division Points allowed: 102.9 per game Blocks: 5.5 per game Steals: 9.3 per game Defensive rebounds: 29.5 per game Finish: Lost Eastern Conference semifinals (4-2) against Philadelphia 76ers\n\nBottom Line: 1981-82 Milwaukee Bucks The Bucks made it a long day at the office for their opponents. Any Don Nelson-coached team is known for its Nellie Ball style, which is an offensive-oriented scheme that often has defense taking a backseat. But Milwaukee Buck-ed that trend and posted the best defensive rating of any team in the 1981-82 season. The tone for the team\u2019s defense was set in the backcourt with Quinn Buckner and Sidney Moncrief. Those two combined for 10 All-Defensive selections in their careers. They specialized in getting steals and forcing turnovers as the Bucks ranked in the top five in both of those stats.\n\n8. 1976-77 Denver Nuggets Dan Issel, left, and the Nuggets weren't afraid to go head-to-head with anyone. Record: 50-32 (.610 winning percentage), first place in Midwest Division Points allowed: 107.4 per game Blocks: 5.7 per game Steals: 11.6 per game Defensive rebounds: 32.9 per game Finish: Lost Western Conference semifinals (4-2) against Portland Trail Blazers\n\nBottom Line: 1976-77 Denver Nuggets Bring a lunchpail and a hard hat. Because of the thin air in Denver, the Nuggets have historically been offensive-oriented teams that use pace to their advantage in order to tire opponents. This team was no different and ranked second in pace, but they also ranked first in defensive rating, which is points allowed per 100 possessions. They also led the league in steals as coach Larry Brown employed undersized lineups that used their quickness to jump passing lanes before they would then race down the other end of the court for easy baskets.\n\n7. 2010-11 Chicago Bulls Derrick Rose was one of the game's elite players before injuries changed his career trajectory. Record: 62-20 (.756 winning percentage), first place in Central Division Points allowed: 91.3 per game Blocks: 5.7 per game Steals: 7.2 per game Defensive rebounds: 32.4 per game Finish: Lost Eastern Conference finals (4-1) against Miami Heat\n\nBottom Line: 2010-11 Chicago Bulls Skywalkers make good shot blockers. You can\u2019t have a greatest defensive teams list without including a Tom Thibodeau-coached team. The 2010-11 season is best remembered for Derrick Rose winning the MVP, but the strength of that Bulls team was their man-to-man defense. Thibodeau\u2019s teams didn\u2019t put up big stats in terms of steals and blocks, but they could lock you down and made scoring an arduous task. The Bulls held opponents to the lowest two-point percentage (45.6 percent), the lowest three-point percentage (32.6 percent), and thus, the lowest field goal percentage (43.0 percent) in the league. The Bulls won all three of their regular-season games against the Miami Heat in their first year of the Big 3, but the Heat got their revenge by eliminating the Bulls from the playoffs.\n\n6. 1998-99 San Antonio Spurs Don't mess with The Admiral. Record: 37-13 (.740 winning percentage), first place in Midwest Division Points allowed: 84.7 per game Blocks: 7.0 per game Steals: 8.4 per game Defensive rebounds: 31.7 per game Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-1) against New York Knicks\n\nBottom Line: 1998-99 San Antonio Spurs Welcome to the party. This season was shortened to 50 games due to a lockout so continuity was important in a truncated season. The Spurs had that as they kept the same starting lineup for their last 47 games, including playoffs, and went 40-7 over that span. The Twin Towers of Tim Duncan and David Robinson controlled the paint as the Spurs led the league in blocks, and those two players alone blocked more shots than 13 entire teams. Their top-ranked defense got even better in the playoffs as San Antonio allowed just over 81 points per game and had more games with opponents scoring in the 60s (2) than they had games with opponents scoring in the 100s (1). That's remarkable.\n\n5. 2007-08 Boston Celtics When team leaders like KG play hard on defense, that sets the tone for the whole team. Record: 66-16 (.805 winning percentage), first place in Atlantic Division Points allowed: 90.3 per game Blocks: 4.6 per game Steals: 8.5 per game Defensive rebounds: 31.9 per game Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-2) against Los Angeles Lakers\n\nBottom Line: 2007-08 Boston Celtics The 2008 Celtics won Boston's 17th NBA title. This team ushered in the era of super teams as Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen joined Paul Pierce in Beantown. But the calling card of this unit was defense, and it was loaded with former and future All-Defensive players. With Garnett and Rajon Rondo in the starting lineup, and Tony Allen and P.J. Brown off the bench, those four players combined to make 25 All-Defensive Teams during their careers. Garnett claimed the Defensive Player of the Year award and deserves as much credit for his on-court play as he does for his leadership and getting the defensive-aversive Pierce and Allen to buy into competing on that end of the court.\n\n4. 2003-04 San Antonio Spurs Hope you don't like scoring points. Record: 57-25 (.695 winning percentage), second place in Midwest Division Points allowed: 84.3 per game Blocks: 6.5 per game Steals: 8.1 per game Defensive rebounds: 32.5 per game Finish: Lost Western Conference semifinals (4-2) against Los Angeles Lakers\n\nBottom Line: 2003-04 San Antonio Spurs Look, ma. No hands. There have been five Spurs championship seasons over the last 21 years, but this non-championship team is statistically the best defensive one in franchise history. They allowed nine fewer points than the league average and held opponents to barely 40 percent shooting, which was the best in the league. This Spurs team lost Hall of Famer David Robinson to retirement but adequately replaced him with big man Rasho Nesterovic and \"Big Shot Bob,\" Robert Horry, who had a knack of being in the right place at the right time on both ends of the court. This is a forgotten Spurs team thanks to Derek Fisher and 0.4 seconds, but it\u2019s the best defensive Spurs team of all time.\n\n3. 1963-64 Boston Celtics Bill Russell was a rebounding king. Record: 59-21 (.738 winning percentage), first place in Eastern Division Points allowed: 105.1 per game Blocks: N/A Steals: N/A Defensive rebounds: N/A Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-1) against San Francisco Warriors\n\nBottom Line: 1963-64 Boston Celtics The Celtics of the 1960 were on another level. This was the best defensive team of Bill Russell\u2019s career and the best defensive team in Celtics history which is saying a lot. Russell averaged a career-high of 24.7 rebounds per game and led the league in that stat, individually, as the Celtics led the NBA in rebounding as a team. The NBA didn\u2019t separate offensive and defensive rebounds at this time so a rebound was just a rebound, but since the Celtics held opponents to the second-fewest points per game, there\u2019s a good chance that the vast majority of those boards were on the defensive end. These Celtics had, statistically, the worst offense in the NBA that season, which points to just how great their defense was to win the championship.\n\n2. 1995-96 Chicago Bulls How good were the 1996 Bulls? They made Shaq look small. Record: 72-10 (.878 winning percentage), 1st place in Central Division Points allowed: 92.9 per game Blocks: 4.2 per game Steals: 9.1 per game Defensive rebounds: 29.4 per game Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-2) against Seattle Supersonics\n\nBottom Line: 1995-96 Chicago Bulls We got you covered. The best team that Michael Jordan ever played on was also the best defensive team he suited up for. With Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Ron Harper all standing between 6-foot-6 and 6-foot-8, these Bulls were able to easily switch on the perimeter even before that kind of thing was talked about. Jordan, Pippen and Rodman all made All-Defensive first team to become the first and only NBA team with three players to receive those honors in a season.\n\n1. 2003-04 Detroit Pistons Denied. Record: 54-28 (.659 winning percentage) second place in Central Division Points allowed: 84.3 per game Blocks: 7.0 per game Steals: 8.0 per game Defensive rebounds: 30.4 per game Finish: Won NBA Finals (4-1) against Los Angeles Lakers"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/top-10-defensive-players-nba-history", "page_content": "Defending is a skill that not every player, including many NBA superstars, have in their arsenal. In basketball, judging defenders is not an easy task, given their different sizes and positions they operate in.\n\nNaturally, big players have more obligations at the defensive end than perimeter players or forwards as the physical statures of the former are conducive to more defensive duties. Perimeter players and forwards, on the other hand, also have defensive responsibilities, but they can't be deployed to protect the rim, for example.\n\nTop 10 defensive players in NBA history\n\n70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) 70% Win (110-25-1) Unlock Free tips from our Experts Get Picks Now\n\nNevertheless, the NBA has been graced by some of the finest defensive players in the competition's rich and illustrious history.\n\nIn this article, we will take a look at the top 10 defensive players in the NBA based on the impact they had on the game and what they brought to their team's tables regardless of their physical attributes or defensive responsibilities.\n\nWithout further ado, let's get started.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nConsidering the vast talent pool on the defensive end of the NBA, there has to be an Honourable Mention list for several exemplary defenders who could not make it to our top 10 list. Some of them are as follows:\n\nMichael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Joe Dumars, Larry Bird, Sidney Moncrief, Dennis Johnson, Bruce Bowen, Mark Eaton, David Robinson, Andre Iguodala, Kawhi Leonard, Draymond Green, Tony Allen, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Patrick Ewing, Michael Cooper.\n\n#10 Anthony Davis\n\n2020 NBA Finals - Game Four\n\nMany might think that Anthony Davis has been included in this list because he happens to be one of the finest active defenders in the NBA, but that is not the case.\n\nAD comes up big on both ends!@AntDavis23 (22 PTS, 9 REB, 4 BLK) clutch three and game-sealing block help the @Lakers win Game 4! #NBAFinals Game 5: Friday - 9:00pm/et, ABC pic.twitter.com/w4ajV1krqQ \u2014 NBA (@NBA) October 7, 2020\n\nAnthony Davis has been an extraordinary defender throughout his NBA career, and now that he is on a winning team, he is catching everyone's attention. His defensive displays during the 2020 NBA Playoffs were exemplary, and he was easily the best defensive player for the LA Lakers during the entire 2019-20 season.\n\nHis versatility, along with his shot-blocking ability, makes him one of the ten best defenders ever in the NBA. His battles with Nikola Jokic in the paint in the Western Conference Finals and then with Jimmy Butler in the NBA Finals were impressive, to say the least.\n\nThe NBA Defensive Player of the Year award eluded him this year, but he will undoubtedly be in the reckoning for it next year. Davis has been named in the All-Defensive NBA teams four times in his career and has led the league in blocks on three occasions while averaging 1.4 steals per game.\n\nQuite simply, he is disruptive in defence, and that is an essential attribute to have in any winning team.\n\n#9 Gary Payton\n\nGary Payton (center) did an excellent job against Michael Jordan in the 1996 NBA Finals.\n\nArguably the greatest perimeter defender ever, Gary Payton is the only Point Guard to have won the prestigious NBA Defensive Player of the Year honor.\n\nHis defense was formidable against any opposing team. When his ability to get in his rivals' heads is added to the mix, one could imagine how difficult it was to run the usual offense against a defense led by Gary Payton.\n\nIn the 1996 NBA Finals against the Bulls, Payton's Seattle Supersonics fell in six games, but Payton and his crew held the Great Michael Jordan to 'just' 27 points per game on 41% from the field. That was just one of the shining examples of the Glove's defensive prowess.\n\nGary Payton was named nine times in the NBA's All-Defensive teams and was the Defensive Player of the Year in the 1995-96 season after leading the league in steals with 2.9.\n\n#8 Kevin Garnett\n\nA versatile and energetic defender, Kevin Garnett is among the greatest to have graced the competition.\n\nKevin Garnett's NBA career was nothing short of iconic. Though he spent 12 seasons battling in Minnesota, where he made the playoffs eight times but went past the first round only once, his defense was always at a very high level.\n\nAfter he was traded to Boston, his intensity and defensive efforts helped the team win their first NBA title since 1986 and their only championship in the preceding 34 years. He took the Defensive Player of the Year honors in the 2007-08 campaign for being the defensive leader and elevating the Boston Celtics' defensive game.\n\nKevin Garnett led the league in rebounding four times and was named in the All-Defensive teams on ten occasions (eight times in the first team). He is also one of only two players to be in the Top 20 in both steals and blocks in NBA history (Hakeem Olajuwon being the other).\n\n#7 Ben Wallace\n\nDetroit Pistons vs Atlanta Hawks\n\nBen Wallace was the anchor of one of the greatest defensive teams in NBA history - the 2003-04 Detroit Pistons. The Pistons held the star-studded Shaquille O'Neil - Kobe Bryant-led LA Lakers to a 96.1 offensive rating in the Finals and out-rebounded them by eight rebounds, an effort that was led by Wallace.\n\nA four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year award winner, which is a joint record for most in the category, Wallace held his own against any center who was a solid scorer, including Miami's Shaquille O'Neal in the 2004 Finals and the 2005 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nWallace averaged ten rebounds per game in 1088 games in the NBA, and he led the league twice in rebounds per game, with a career-high of 15.4. His most impressive defensive display occurred in the 2004 NBA Playoffs. That season, he led Detroit to the title from the defensive side of the court and led the league in defensive rating with a whopping 83.9 and defensive win shares of 2.8.\n\n#6 Dikembe Mutombo\n\nDikembe Mutombo's signature finger wag\n\nAnother four-time winner of the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award, Dikembe Mutombo was one of the greatest shot-blockers ever. His ability to time his jumps and managing to block shots without fouling opponents was his greatest attribute.\n\nMutombo, who led some pretty solid defenses in NBA history, ranks second in blocked shots with 3,289. He led the league twice in terms of total rebounds and three times in blocked shots.\n\nDikembe won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award with three different teams - Denver Nuggets, Atlanta Hawks (twice) and the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nHe led Philadelphia defensively when the team made a run to the 2001 NBA Finals; Mutombo had his hands full against eventual Finals MVP Shaquille O'Neal, but he still averaged more than two blocks a game.\n\n#5 Dwight Howard\n\nDwight Howard is still a defensive beast.\n\nA three-time winner of the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award and the only one to win it in three consecutive years, Dwight Howard might be a role player today. However, he was as dominating as anyone in defense and was at the heart of an Orlando Magic team that probably had no business facing the LA Lakers in the 2009 NBA Finals.\n\nCongrats to @DwightHoward of the @Lakers for moving up to 14th on the all-time BLOCKS list. pic.twitter.com/1QAsXczlli \u2014 NBA (@NBA) February 2, 2020\n\nDuring his prime, there wasn't a better shot-blocker and rebounder in the league than Howard who has been named in the NBA's All-Defensive team five times. He also led the league in rebounds five times and twice in blocked shots.\n\nNow an NBA champion, Howard's defense was in full display during the LA Lakers' 2020 Playoffs run, with the player managing to get inside Nikola Jokic's head in the Western Conference Finals and protecting the rim impressively.\n\n#4 Tim Duncan\n\nKenyon Martin being defended by Tim Duncan (right)\n\nThe game of Tim Duncan, arguably the greatest power forward in NBA history, was not as much about his offense and beautiful off-the-glass shots but his defense, which was probably his greatest asset.\n\nDuncan made the NBA's All-Defensive teams a record 15 times during his 18-year career, and he ranks fifth in all-time blocks in the regular season while leading the table in the NBA Playoffs.\n\nDespite being a two-time regular-season MVP and three-time Finals MVP winner, Duncan never won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award. However, he did not really need that as he has already etched his name in the competition's history books as one of the finest defenders ever.\n\nMoreover, Duncan ranks second all-time in defensive win shares with 106.34 and is third in defensive rating with 95.57.\n\n#3 Hakeem Olajuwon\n\nHakeem Olajuwon was a versatile defender.\n\nThe Dream Hakeem Olajuwon can best be described as one of the most unique players on both sides of the court in NBA history. He is easily in the discussion for the best defenders of all time, and his case is a pretty solid one.\n\nOlajuwon is the all-time leader in blocked shots in the NBA regular season, but what was really an anomaly for his position was that he could also guard perimeter players and stay in front of them with consummate ease.\n\nThe Dream's offensive play was eye-catching, but his defensive prowess arguably stood out more.\n\nHe was named in the NBA's All-Defensive teams on nine occasions and led the league in defensive rating five times. He is fourth in the all-time defensive win shares ranking. Moreover, Olajuwon was the first player to rank in the top 20 in both steals and rebounds and the only one to be in the top ten in both categories.\n\n#2 Bill Russell\n\nAn 11-time NBA champion, Bill Russell was the ultimate shot-blocker.\n\nIf Bill Russell tops the list of the NBA's best defenders ever, he would not look out of place as his defensive numbers and impact on the game were huge.\n\nA staggering total of 11 NBA championships in 13 seasons were not won by just scoring. Bill Russell was the total package in defense. He was a revolutionary defender in the sense that he perfected the art of blocking shots.\n\nRussell was a beast in the paint and often blocked shots when his team needed it the most. Perhaps, more importantly, he was always smart enough to block a shot and make the ball stay in bounds for a teammate to pick it up.\n\nHall of Famer Isiah Thomas once said about Russell:\n\n\"You do not win 11 NBA titles purely on athleticism or skill. You win with smart people.\"\n\nThomas' words couldn't have been more true as Russell was beyond smart.\n\nHe is second all-time in rebounds and would easily have been top two in blocked shots if that stat was tracked by the NBA when he played. Of course, he was also a five-time regular-season MVP award winner and would have probably won 11 Finals MVP honors if the award existed back then.\n\n#1 Dennis Rodman\n\nDennis Rodman is arguably the greatest defender and rebounder in NBA history.\n\nOne may not find Dennis Rodman's name in most major defensive stats tables, but he was easily the greatest defender to ever step onto an NBA basketball court.\n\nRodman had the versatility of a guard during his prime and was able to cover any player ranging from Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Clyde Drexler to Charles Barkley, Karl Malone, Hakeem Olajuwon and even Shaquille O'Neal during his late NBA days.\n\nHe was an efficient defender and did well against any player from the 1 to 5 positions even when he was only 6' 7\" tall, a height considered small for his role.\n\nA two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year award winner, Rodman led the league seven straight years from 1991 to 1998 in terms of rebounds per game. He once averaged 18.7 rebounds and over 15 rebounds a game.\n\nEven when he was in his late 30s, Rodman could handle Karl Malone in the NBA Finals or Shaquille O'Neil in the Eastern Conference Finals, managing to keep them relatively quiet.\n\nA five-time NBA winner, he was a key player for all his teams from a defensive standpoint and in terms of his extraordinary rebounding ability.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://infocopse.com/best-nba-defenders-of-all-time/", "page_content": "NBA playoff season is in full swing and there have been a number of big steals so far.
