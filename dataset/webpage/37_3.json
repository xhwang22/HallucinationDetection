As of late-2018, sources estimate a net worth that is at $4 million, earned through a successful career in acting. She\u2019s also appeared in numerous other television shows and feature films throughout her career, and as she continues her endeavors even well into her \u201870s, it is expected that her wealth will also continue to increase.\n\nCareer Beginnings\n\nWhile virtually no information is available about Jeannine\u2019s early life, it is known that she developed an interest in acting at a young age. She started her career in the early 1960s, appearing in small or uncredited roles in projects such as \u201cFive Finger Exercise\u201d. In 1963, she was cast in the sitcom \u201cPetticoat Junction\u201d in the role of Billie Jo Bradley, set in the Shady Rest Hotel run by Kate Bradley, her three daughters and her uncle. The series was created after the success of \u201cThe Beverly Hillbillies\u201d and the success of this show led to the spin-off entitled \u201cGreen Acres\u201d.\n\nShe stayed with the show until 1965, then decided to leave the series to pursue more film work, replaced by Gunila Hutton and later Meredith MacRae during the latter seasons. Jeannine then started to do film work in the late 1960s, appearing in \u201cThe Big Mouth\u201d as Bambi Berman, filmed in San Diego and featuring Frank De Vol as an on-screen narrator.\n\nThe 3 original Bradley Sisters\u2026Betty Jo {Linda Kaye Henning}, Bobbi Jo {Pat Woodell}, and Billie Jo {Jeannine Riley.} Posted by Debbie Spivey on Saturday, January 26, 2019\n\nCareer Prominence\n\nThe following year Riley was cast in \u201cFever Heat\u201d, which was directed by Russell S. Doughten and starring alongside Nick Adams and Norman Alden. In 1969 she was cast in the film \u201cThe Comic\u201d, co-written and co-produced by Carl Reiner and starring Dick Van Dyke, Michele Lee and Mickey Rooney in a film inspired by the end of the silent film era.\n\nAfter that she returned to television, as she was cast in a regular role in the comedy variety series entitled \u201cHee Haw\u201d during the same year, which was set in fictional rural Kornfield Kounty, and inspired by \u201cRowan & Martin\u2019s Laugh-In\u201d. The show centered on rural culture and country music, with hosts Buck Owens as well as Roy Clark, but would often feature scantily clad women in stereotypical farmer\u2019s daughters attire, who came to be known as the Hee Haw Honeys. She stayed with the show for three years, and then joined another show in \u201cDusty\u2019s Trail\u201d, in which she played Lulu McQueen, a western-theme take-off of Ginger Grant from \u201cGilligan\u2019s Island\u201d, also starring Forrest Tucker and Bob Denver.\n\nLater Career\n\nOver the next few years, Jeannine had small roles in television shows such as \u201cThe Wild Wild West\u201d, \u201cRoute 66\u201d, and \u201cThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.\u201d She then featured in the film \u201cElectra Glide in Blue\u201d, which starred Robert Blake as a motorcycle cop alongside Billy \u201cGreen\u201d Bush, and based on the Harley-Davidson Electra Glide motorcycle used by traffic police. During the same year, she had an uncredited role in \u201cThe Outfit\u201d, actually appearing as a prostitute in an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Richard Stark under the pseudonym Donald E. Westlake.\n\nAs the years progressed, Jeannine took fewer roles; she was a part of the 1980s project entitled \u201cLone Star Bar & Grill\u201d as Arlene, and one of her last projects was the 1991 film entitled \u201cTimebomb\u201d, which starred Michael Biehn, Richard Jordan and Patsy Kensit.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFor her personal life, it is known that Riley married Gary Groom in 1965 but their marriage ended in divorce in 1972. She married once more in 1974 to Irwin Radnitz but it was also a marriage that ended in divorce. There are no reported children from her marriages.\n\nSince retiring from acting work, very little information has been shared about her. One of the reasons is due to the fact that she does not have any accounts on major social media websites. In 2016, a book was released entitled \u201cX Child Stars: Where Are They Now\u201d, written by Kathy Garver and Fred Ascher, which contained a profile of her along with her career. Many sources speculate that since ending her acting career, she focused more on other endeavors, and likely another marriage and a family, but there is no evidence to confirm these speculations.\n\nFacts # Fact 1 Jeannine Riley and Steve Ihnat co-starred together in the play, \"The Fourposter\", put on by the Sherman Oaks Playhouse for two months, from mid-April to mid-August, 1953.

She appeared on the show\u2019s first two seasons which lasted up until the mid-1960s and then had memorable stints in a string of other productions, including Route 66, The Man From U.N.C.L, Fever heat, and The Comic.\n\nHowever, she probably stopped enjoying acting as she started to scale back on her appearances in the \u201990s and soon, she left the limelight completely. Her last film role was as Landlady in the 1991 film Timebomb. Since this role, Jeannine has not appeared in any film or does she plan to do so soon. However, her exit from the spotlight without officially announcing her retirement has many people wondering where she is now and what lead to her disappearance.\n\nJeannine Riley\u2019s Biography\n\nJeannine Riley was born in Madera, California USA, on 1st October 1940 and named Jeannine Brooke Riley. From the look of things, the actress must\u2019ve been one of the most enigmatic actresses in her time as there is no information about her. Not even her educational history, or childhood, despite the terrific fame she enjoyed during her active years in the film industry. The much that is known about her is that she began her acting career professionally in 1962 with a role in the Rosalind Russell drama Five Finger Exercise.\n\nShe followed the role up with an appearance in Father of the Bride, My Three Sons and Route 66. At age 23, she appeared in the suspense drama Strike Me Deadly with Gary Clarke and Steve Ihnat. She went on to work with Ihnat in The Fourposter \u2013 a stage play.\n\nAt this point, she had started to gradually climb the prestigious career ladder. Her performances in Wagon Train and The Virginian helped to solidify her position in the limelight and drew the interest of CBS. It also prepared a stage for her star-making role in Petticoat Junction (1963) as one of the daughters of Kate Bradley \u2013 played by Bea Benaderet. The role remains what she is known for to date.\n\nMeanwhile, she was not the first choice for the role. Sharon Tate was chosen for it but the actress lost the slot when she got involved in nude photoshoots, mostly because explicit contents were seen as somewhat a taboo at that time. Luckily, Jeannine was picked to replace Tate when her role was recast.\n\nAfter two seasons of the series, Jeannine Riley left and was replaced by Gunilla Hutton. Even after she left the show, life stayed kind to her acting career as she made more TV appearances including guest-starring on Ozzie and Harriet. She also played a part on the Smothers Brothers Show. In 1967, she secured roles in different films; The Big Mouth, The Wild, Gomer Pyle and a lot more.\n\nThe following year, she worked with Nick Adams in Fever Heat (1968), which is among the last films of the actor before his demise. After a few more acting works in the 1960s, her next appearance was in 1973 \u2013 in Electra Glide in Blue. At this point, Hollywood was beginning to accept nudity and Jeannine was willing to show some skin. Her nude scenes in the movie made her an instant star but Jeannine probably wanted something else as her presence on TV started to reduce following this role. In 1991, she left completely after starring in the film, Timebomb.\n\nHer Family\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Jeannine Riley doesn\u2019t let people into matters concerning her private life. So, nothing is known about her siblings, parents, or any other relative. It is, however, known that she has been married twice and none of her marriages survived the test of time. Her first marriage was to Gary Grom in 1965. It failed in 1972 and in less than two years after their divorce, Jeannine married Irwin Radnitz which ended in a similar manner. None of her marriages or past relationships produced a child and since then, her love life has been blurred from the public.\n\nRead Also: Who Was Ann Sothern?\n\nWhere Is Jeannine Riley Now?\n\nNobody is sure of what Jeannine has been up to since 1991 when she left the spotlight. She probably wants nothing more than people knowing less about her as she is not even active on social media either, making it very difficult to dig out anything about her. But there are rumors that she left the acting scene possibly to focus on her family while others have taken the view that she pursued a different career. Nonetheless, these rumors haven\u2019t been confirmed to-this-date. In this regard, her whereabouts remain a mystery."}, {"url": "https://doyouremember.com/157936/jeannine-riley-career-then-now", "page_content": "Billie Jo Bradley was a model of ambition and unbridled hope and awe in Petticoat Junction and none other than Jeannine Riley debuted the role in 1963. Two others would follow, but not before Riley left a permanent mark on the show and set the stage for seven seasons of Billie Jo greatness. But what about Riley herself? What trajectory did her career follow? In short, one her character would have been proud of.\n\nJeannine Riley was born on October 1, 1940, and grew up in California for much of her upbringing after her father left for the Army and her family planted roots in Madera. She learned acting and the ways of show business in the Pasadena Playhouse while also performing ballet. She started working on television and an uncredited role in the 1962 movie Five Finger Exercise before television work arose in greater succession. Early credits included Father of the Bride, My Three Sons, Route 66, and The Beauty Contest. Indeed, her easy, approachable grace helped pave the way for more and more prominence on TV not long into her career.\n\nWhy did Jeannine Riley leave \u2018Petticoat Junction\u2019?\n\nHer career had just begun in 1962 and still Jeannine Riley managed to turn some important heads. Namely, CBS producers noticed her while she acted in Wagon Train and The Virginian and as rural shows dominated televisions, they wanted Riley for their next big project: Petticoat Junction. With the rural purge still a decade away, the wholesome series joined the ranks of Beverly Hillbillies and The Andy Griffith Show as a recipe for success. Initially, actress and model Sharon Tate was slated to originate the role of Billie Jo, but after a nude photoshoot, she was deemed too risque for a series sponsored by Ivory Soap; Riley ended up winning the role of 300 other hopefuls.\n\nRiley channeled that easy charisma into her role and won hearts on-screen and off. But just like her character possessed endless aspirations, so too did Riley, and after two years she bowed out of the series to pursue a film career, as well as try out some other shows, including Gilligan\u2019s Island and Hee Haw. She did make it into movies as planned, such as The Big Mouth and Fever Heat. One of her most prominent roles came in 1973 as Lulu McQueen in Dusty\u2019s Trail, which saw Riley as a kind of Ginger Grant in a western reimagining of Gilligan\u2019s Island complete with Bob Denver himself and Lori Saunders.\n\nIt\u2019s about time to be a bolder woman\n\nRiley wanted to break away from roles that cast her on the basis of her looks alone but found this a difficult endeavor. New opportunities grew fewer. Her final film came with 1991\u2019s Timebomb, a science-fiction action movie starring Michael Biehn. She retired that same year but stays involved in the industry in other ways; the 2016 book X Child Stars: Where Are They Now? offers a look at her life and career. Her personal life included marriage first to Gary Groom from 1965 to 1972, then Irwin Radnitz in 1974 until they too divorced.\n\nWhile Riley is not reported to have any children, she has still used her life\u2019s experiences to guide the next generation. In typical Billie Jo fashion, she wants to see women be successful, something she herself is familiar with. In 2020, she penned the book The Bolder Woman: It\u2019s About Time, all about encouraging and instructing women on how they can follow their dreams at any age. \u201cCome along with me as I reveal how I overcame my own fear of aging and being labeled an old woman just because I\u2019d reached a certain number of years,\u201d Riley invites readers. \u201cYour many years of living has brought you this far, so why stop now?\u201d\n\nWe certainly hope Riley doesn\u2019t stop for a long time!"}, {"url": "https://www.playbill.com/article/celebrate-the-61st-anniversary-of-bye-bye-birdie-on-broadway", "page_content": "The original Broadway production of Bye Bye Birdie opened at the Martin Beck Theatre April 14, 1960.

At the time, Hillbilly cast member Bea Benaderet (as Cousin Pearl) had just been given the green light to star in her own bucolic series, Petticoat Junction (1963), playing Kate Bradley, a hotel-owning widowed mother of three beautiful nubile daughters. The flirty role of daughter Billie Jo Bradley was at first given to actress Sharon Tate, but when word came out that she had posed nude in photo shoots, they were forced to dismiss her from the wholesome Ivory-Soap-sponsored series before scandal and controversy could cause damage. The part was recast and Jeannine won the role.\n\nThe actress was ideal as the Daisy Mae-like eldest daughter who attracted men like bees to honey, much to the envy of her impressionable younger sisters. Jeannine played the role for two years before both she and Pat Woodell (as sister Bobbie Jo) opted out of the series. While Jeannine wanted to move into film work, Woodell, who went on to marry and divorce Gary Clarke, Jeannine's film co-star in Strike Me Deadly (1963), desired a singing career. Jeannine and Pat were replaced in 1965 by Gunilla Hutton and Lori Saunders.\n\nWhile the actress continued on with TV guest roles on \"Ozzie and Harriet,\" \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" and \"Occasional Wife,\" and as a on \"The sometimes-sexy foil on \"The Smothers Brothers Show,\" she found breaking away from her bombshell trappings too difficult and was soon appearing as sexpot Bambi Berman in the Jerry Lewis film vehicle The Big Mouth (1967), and in unsold pilots of Sheriff Who (1967) and Li'l Abner (1967); in this latter she finally got to play the voluptuous Daisy Mae character. Guest episodes of \"The Wild, Wild West\" and \"Gomer Pyle\" also showed a return to familiar territory.\n\nAfter starring with Nick Adams in one of his last films before his untimely death, the action drama Fever Heat (1968), Jeannine showed up in her first quality film showcase, albeit a smaller part, with The Comic (1969), a moving showcase for nimble Dick Van Dyke as a silent screen star. She found an even better role as dancer/barmaid babe Jolene opposite biker Robert Blake in the cult film Electra Glide in Blue (1973), sharing some potent nude scenes.\n\nBack in the country fold on series TV, she appeared in two seasons of the cornpone musical variety show Hee Haw (1969), in which she was featured as a Daisy Mae-like foil in silly skits. A couple years later she was cast in the \"Gilligan's Island\"-inspired TV western Dusty's Trail (1973) with Bob Denver and Forrest Tucker co-starring as Gilligan/Skipper-like characters; Jeannine's Lulu McQueen was a dead-on take on the pneumatic Ginger Grant role. Petticoat Junction (1963) co-star Lori Saunders co-starred in the series as innocent Betsy McGuire, a variation of the Mary Ann character. It lasted one season.\n\nSince then, however, the availability of parts has sharply declined; Jeannine's last credits were the films Lone Star Bar & Grill (1983) and Timebomb (1991)."}, {"url": "https://jeannineriley.com/", "page_content": "Ladies, the question isn\u2019t about how to live longer, it\u2019s about how to live BETTER.

And, she\u2019s working on Broadway-bound \u201cAlmost Famous\u201d and \u201cThe Outsiders.\u201d All of this propels her into a rarified class: Women choreographers who had multiple shows staged in the same season.\n\nJust before the pandemic, a record number of women were choreographing Broadway shows.\n\nOver the years, Susan Stroman twice had two shows open in a season, and Agnes de Mille did so three times. But how to count this jagged season with openings, closings, and re-openings? Ultimately, the answer is a precious few women have achieved this height. Latarro had been unaware that she was in these ranks but smiled wide at being in a pantheon with de Mille and Stroman.\n\nNone of this was overnight, she explains to NJ Advance Media over two Zoom interviews.\n\n\u201cI skipped no steps,\u201d Latarro says from a Manhattan studio. \u201cI went from dancer on stage to dance captain, to assisting choreographers to associate choreographic positions and then choreography. The good news about that is that I do not have imposter syndrome.

The director\u2019s touches elicited the best responses from the audience.\n\nWhenever Bushnell mentioned her shoes (Carrie Bradshaw is the fictionalized Bushnell, so the shoe love is real), the stage\u2019s back wall featuring exquisite footwear would light up. When Bushnell\u2019s dogs trotted on stage, that, too, was Latarro\u2019s idea.\n\nLorin Latarro choreographs and directs. In December, she did both for a flash birthday dance for her pal Hank Azaria to surprise his wife, KatieWright, in Central Park.Matthew Murphy\n\nWithin days of \u201cSex\u201d shuttering, \u201cWaitress\u201d also closed early because of breakthrough COVID cases in the company. Admittedly, it was a jolt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad to tell a cast that you\u2019re not coming back on Tuesday,\u201d Latarro says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a normal way to close the show. The most heartbreaking of closings I\u2019ve ever had have always had at least two weeks\u2019 notice.\u201d\n\nThough saddened, she was focused on what\u2019s next. Listening to Latarro, it\u2019s clear she\u2019s challenging herself to see what else she can create, how to use dance to tell a story.\n\nLatarro, 43, became enchanted with Broadway at her first show, \u201cThe King and I,\u201d and followed that with \u201cAnnie.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in Essex County, her dad, dentist, John Campolattaro, and mom, Eileen Campolattaro, enrolled Latarro in her first dance lessons at what was Miss Sandy School of Dance with Sandra Coyte. Latarro also studied at Dance Theater in Fairfield and The New Jersey School of Ballet in Florham Park before her parents started driving her into Manhattan for classes at Broadway Dance Center.\n\nLatarro started to choreograph while at Juilliard, then danced with Momix Inc.\n\n\u201cIt was really groupthink,\u201d she says of that company. \u201cYou get to really be creative.\u201d\n\nDancer and choreographer Lorin Latarro has studied many genres of dance and still takes ballet class.\n\nShe began landing Broadway roles, from her debut as a replacement in the ensemble of 1999\u2032s \u201cKiss Me Kate\u201d to being chosen for the original cast of the 2002 version of \u201cMan of La Mancha\u201d and performing in revivals of \u201cA Chorus Line,\u201d and \u201cGuys and Dolls.\u201d\n\nBy 2010, Latarro added associate choreographer to her credits and has kept going. By the time she worked on \u201cScandalous,\u201d a short-lived musical from Kathie Lee Gifford, Latarro had earned the rank of the choreographer.\n\nEven in some shows best forgotten, like \u201cScandalous,\u201d or those that received mixed reviews, like \u201cMrs. Doubtfire,\u201d the choreography stood out. \u201cDoubtfire,\u201d which opened in December, is on hiatus because of the omicron surge. It\u2019s scheduled to return March 15.\n\nTo flesh out the character of Mrs. Doubtfire, Robin Williams, who starred in the movie, had studied the mannerisms of a beloved Juilliard security guard, Nora. Latarro, another Juilliard grad, also knew her.\n\n\u201cNora had a very particular gait, and everything about her was very particular,\u201d Latarro says. \u201cNora is burned in my head as Mrs. Doubtfire, for sure.\u201d\n\nLatarro\u2019s choreography is not easily pigeon-holed. Even in Doubtfire, she wove in tap, traditional Broadway moves, hip-hop and flamenco. Ballet is evident in certain lifts, swing filters into some shows, as do modern steps. She has studied and danced it all.\n\nShe well remembers what it was like being that kid who just wanted to dance and offers a bit of advice for young dancers.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fake dancing,\u201d says the woman who still takes class and has her 3-year-old daughter in ballet. \u201cAnd that\u2019s one of the reasons I love it. Just do the work, be happy to be there. If you just stay with it, the more dance styles you can do, the more you will be hired.\n\n\u201cAnd for choreography, it really is about asking the question of why and what do I want to say about this?\u201d she adds. \u201cHow do I want to physicalize this idea?\u201d\n\nEven with 16 Broadway credits to her name, Latarro retains the enthusiasm of the Fairfield girl mesmerized by those bright lights.\n\n\u201cI love Broadway,\u201d she Latarro says. \u201cI love theater, and this was a dream come true for me. And it still is. It\u2019s still a dream every day.\u201d\n\nJacqueline Cutler may be reached at jacqueline.cutler@gmail.com.

The legends of Old Hollywood will live on forever with their names on the Hollywood walk of fame, their faces on our screens and their memories embedded in our minds.\n\nThe Old Hollywood sign was originally Hollywoodland\n\nHistory of Old Hollywood\n\nThe beginning of the Old Hollywood era is marked by the introduction of sound films. Changing from silent films to \u201cthe talkies\u201d was a changing point in Hollywood and with it came a rise to global cinema.In 1927, \u201cThe Jazz Singer\u201d was the first film to use synchronized dialogue and it marked the beginning of the end for silent films. The Academy Awards also began that same year and Warner Bros. received an Honorary Award for their pioneering on \u201cThe Jazz Singer\u201d. The movie was not nominated as Best Picture as it was deemed unfair to put a \u201ctalkie\u201d up against silent movies.\n\nThe Old Hollywood era is understood to be the time when Hollywood dominated the film industry. Hollywood was the American dream for actors and actresses who hoped to make it onto the big screen. Old Hollywood is considered one of the most successful eras of filmmaking, with endless classics produced during this time. Sound films brought stardom to Hollywood.\n\nDuring the Golden Age of Hollywood there were five main studios that were producing movies in Hollywood. Each studio used prefered actors and actresses and also often followed a certain genre of film in the majority of their movies. You will recognise these studio names from your favourite Old Hollywood movies;\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer or MGM : MGM was the biggest studio during this time and it was ran by Louis B. Mayer alongside Irving Thalberg. Mayer is also credited for organising the very first Academy Awards in 1927. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, MGM produced Academy Award winning films such as Gone with the Wind, The Wizard of Oz, Ben-Hur and West Side Story. MGM is still today one of the biggest studios still producing many Award winning films after the Old Hollywood era, including The Silence of the Lambs, Rain Man and Dances with Wolves. It is also responsible for the incredibly successful film franchises James Bond and Rocky. The roaring lion is the symbol for MGM.\n\nParamount Pictures : Paramount Pictures have been around for over 100 years and they are the last remaining major studio still based in Hollywood out of the five major studios that once stood during the Golden Age of Hollywood. Paramount Pictures was founded by Adolph Zukor and W. W. Hodkinson and the famous Paramount logo that we have come to know so well was inspired by a mountain peak in Hodkinson\u2019s childhood home and the 22 stars represent the 22 film stars that were signed with Paramount. Some of Paramounts most successful films during the Golden Age of Hollywood were The Ten Commandments, Sunset Boulevard, The Greatest Show on Earth and White Christmas.\n\nWarner Brothers : Warner Bros. was founded in 1923 by four brothers, Harry, Albert, Samuel and Jack Warner. Warner Brothers quickly made a name as one of the Big Five in Hollywood when they revolutionized the film industry by producing The Jazz SInger in 1927. Warner Bros is well known for contributing to many classic films throughout the Golden Age of Hollywood, for example, Casablanca, Rebel Without a Cause and My Fair Lady.\n\n20th Century Fox : 20th Century Fox was founded in 1935 after the mergence of Twentieth Century Pictures, which was founded by Joseph Schenck and Darryl F. Zanuck and the Fox Film Corporation, which was founded by William Fox. 20th Century had stars such as Shirley Temple and Betty Grable featured in their musicals. Well known Old Hollywood films that 20th Century Fox produced are The Grapes of Wrath, The King and I and South Pacific, All About Eve and Cleopatra. 20th Century Fox was well known for their musicals and westerns.\n\nRKO: Radio-Keith-Orpheum, RKO Pictures was founded in 1928 when David Sarnoff, general manager of RCA and Joseph Kennedy\u2019s FBO merged together. When RKO formed they declared that they would only make films with sound and that they did. RKO had stars such as Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant signed with them for movies. Some recognisable films that RKO are responsible for during the Golden Age of Hollywood are King Kong, Citizen Kane, Top Hat and Notorious. RKO also distributed films such as It\u2019s a Wonderful Life, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio\n\nAlthough it didn\u2019t make the Big Five during the Golden Age of Hollywood, Universal Pictures were also in operation at the time and produced some classics.\n\nUniversal : Universal Pictures was founded in 1912 by Carl Laemmle, Mark Dintenfass, Charles O. Baumann, Adam Kessel, Pat Powers, William Swanson, David Horsley, Robert H. Cochrane, and Jules Brulatour and it is the fourth oldest major film studio in the world. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, Universal Pictures produced greats such as To Kill a Mockingbird, The Birds, Spartacus and Dracula.\n\nOld Hollywood Glamour\n\nIt has been 60 years since the Golden Age of Hollywood, yet we are still trying to copy and recreate that stunning Hollywood glamour that encompassed Old Hollywood. Old Hollywood Glamour was elegance, sophistication and style. The biggest Hollywood stars were always dressed up to the nines and their casual wear would be nowhere near what we would consider casual today. Make-up, hair and clothes were always perfect and stars had their own unique looks which portrayed their personalities.\n\nStars went to great lengths in order to achieve and maintain Hollywood\u2019s standards of how they should look, from hair transplants, dying their hair and changing their brows. Old Hollywood glamour was about simple, elegant make-up which showed the best version of the stars. It was about tiny waists and stylish clothes. The Old Hollywood glamour look usually looked far more glamorous than the actually reality of it.\n\nSome great books about Old Hollywood glamour are \u201cTimeless: A Century of Iconic Looks\u201d by Louise Young, \u201cStyling the Stars: Lost Treasures from the Twentieth Century Fox Archive\u201d by Angela Cartwright and Tom McLaren, \u201cCostume Design in the Movies: An Illustrated Guide to the Work of 157 Great Designers\u201d by Elizabeth Leese and \u201cEdith Head\u2019s Hollywood\u201d by Paddy Calistro.\n\nOld Hollywood Stars\n\nDuring the Golden Age of Hollywood in order to become a star you had to have a combination of acting, dancing and singing skills. If you couldn\u2019t do all three then you had to be incredible good in one field or just have a face made for the screen. Old Hollywood actors and actresses were idolised and became stars, they saw stardom that no other actor will ever see. The glamour, the glitz and the drama was on another level and it was these stars that started the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nOld Hollywood Actresses\n\nMarilyn Monroe was and still is today a pop cultural icon from the Golden Age of Hollywood\n\nAudrey Hepburn\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s is one of the most iconic films to come from Old Hollywood\n\nAudrey Hepburn was a Belgian-born actress who rose to stardom after her outstanding performance as Gigi in Broadway\u2019s \u201cGigi\u201d.

Riley. Her second single, \"Harper Valley P.T.A.,\" was a runaway hit immediately upon release in 1968; it sold over five million copies in the United States and was the first song by a female artist to top the country and pop charts at the same time. The song also set the template for much of Riley's career to follow, singing songs about the harder side of life and small-town scandal, as seen through the eyes of a down-to-earth woman with a proud spirit and a strong voice -- buoyed by the unapologetic Texas twang of her instrument. The accessible but unabashed country sound of Riley's music took on a softer tone after she embraced Christianity in the late '70s and released albums like 1979's Wings to Fly and 1981's From Harper Valley to the Mountain Top. By the '90s, Riley's recording career had faded out and a struggle with depression kept her out of the public eye for most of the decade, but she made a low-key comeback in the early 2000s, hosting a radio show and returning to live performing.\n\nJeannie C. Riley was born Jeanne Carolyn Stephenson on October 19, 1945 in the small Texas town of Stamford. Her father made his living as a mechanic and her mother had a career of her own as a nurse. Growing up in Texas, Riley grew to love music, and dreamed that her talent could be the key to a better way of life. Riley made her public debut as a singer in the early '60s at a performance hosted by her uncle Johnny Moore, a country singer who had scored a few regional hits. Local country fans were impressed with Riley's performance, and she began singing regularly at Moore's monthly jamborees. She had yet to graduate from high school when she married her boyfriend, Mickey Riley, in December 1962, and they welcomed a daughter, Kim Michelle Riley, in January 1966. Meanwhile, Weldon Myrick, a pedal steel guitarist who had played at several of Riley's jamboree shows in Texas, had relocated to Nashville and felt that rising star Connie Smith sounded a great deal like her. Myrick encouraged Riley to come to Nashville and pursue a career as a singer, and in time Riley and Mickey packed their bags and moved to Music City. She worked as a secretary at Passkey Records while cutting demos in her spare time and eventually struck a deal with Little Darlin' Records, a Nashville label co-founded by Johnny Paycheck. In 1967, Little Darlin' issued her debut single, \"You Write the Music\" b/w \"What About Them.\" Riley would cut an album's worth of material for Little Darlin' but after her first 45 flopped, they declined to release a second single.\n\nRiley's career seemed stuck in neutral until Shelby Singleton, a producer and promotions man who had helped make a fistful of records hits, heard a publishing demo she had recorded for a tune called \"The Old Town Drunk.\" Singleton had recently launched his own country label, Plantation Records, and was eager to cut a tune written by Tom T. Hall about a woman standing up to small-town hypocrites on her daughter's behalf. Singleton believed Riley had the right voice for the song, so he bought out her deal with Little Darlin' and brought her to the studio to cut the song. While initially Riley didn't think much of the song, she gave it a go, and in less than an hour she had cut \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" Upon the single's release, both country and pop radio enthusiastically embraced it, even though some C&W stations blanched at the song's depiction of small town sinfulness, and rock stations usually passed on songs that made no concession to the crossover market. In August 1968, \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" hit the top of the pop and country charts; it was the first time a female artist would manage this feat, and it wouldn't happen again until 1980, when Dolly Parton released \"9 to 5.\"\n\nIn a matter of weeks, Riley went from obscurity to stardom as \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" became a cultural phenomenon and Little Darlin' wasted no time releasing their Riley material on a 1968 album called Sock Soul; in 1969 Capitol would repackage the same LP under the title The Songs of Jeannie C. Riley. It was trounced in the marketplace by Riley's first album for Plantation, called Harper Valley U.S.A., which topped the country album chart and rose to number 12 on the pop survey. The song also earned Riley a Grammy award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" proved to be Riley's first and last single to cross into the Pop Top 40, but she became a frequent presence on network television in 1969 and 1970, starring in her own TV special (titled, of course, Harper Valley P.T.A.) and appearing on The Ed Sullivan Show, The Johnny Cash Show, The Bob Hope Show, American Bandstand, and The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour, as well as touring frequently. Riley continued to enjoy success on the country charts, landing ten more singles in the Country Top 40 between December 1968 and October 1971. (Five of them -- \"The Girl Most Likely,\" \"There Never Was a Time,\" Country Girl,\" \"Oh, Singer,\" and \"Good Enough to Be Your Wife\" -- made the Top Ten.) Riley also knocked out five more albums for Plantation during the same period, but after a dispute between her and Singleton, who she believed was paying her less than her due, she left the label and signed with MGM Records. Her first single for MGM, \"Houston Blues,\" arrived in November 1971, and in 1972 she enjoyed two more Country Top 40 singles, \"Give Myself a Party\" and \"Good Morning Country Rain.\" However, after \"When Love Has Gone Away\" hit number 44 in March 1973, it would mark the last time Riley released a 45 than rose above 50 on the Country Singles charts. Short-lived deals with Mercury and Warner Bros. resulted in singles that made little impression, and while Riley continued to tour, her most successful release of this period was the soundtrack album to a 1978 film adaptation of Harper Valley U.S.A., starring Barbara Eden.\n\nAs Riley struggled with an unhappy marriage, a career on the downturn, and financial woes, she experienced a spiritual rebirth and became a born again Christian. In 1979, she released an album of Christian-themed music, Wings to Fly, and in 1981, she brought out From Harper Valley to the Mountain Top, which appeared at the same time as her memoir of the same name. Throughout the '80s, Riley put her primary focus on spiritual music, though she still recorded secular material on the albums Total Woman (1984) and Jeannie C. Riley (1986), the latter of which found her re-recording \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" The album Here's Jeannie C. arrived in 1991, but a dispute with her manager in the early '90s put Riley back in legal and financial trouble, and she developed a severe case of clinical depression, which prevented her from working for close to six years. By 2000, Riley had recovered her mental and physical health, and became the host of a weekly radio series titled Inside Nashville Country, as well as performing live, speaking to Christian groups, and writing. In 2019, \"Harper Valley P.T.A.\" was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame, intended to recognize recordings of lasting merit and significance."}]}
