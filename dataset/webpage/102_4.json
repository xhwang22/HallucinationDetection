The outgoing technocrat prime minister, once dubbed \"Super Mario\" for his prowess at the European commission, was super no longer. His centrist alliance seemed all but certain to come a poor fourth \u2013 to a comedian.\n\n\"What a disaster for Monti. A huge communications failure,\" was the verdict of Bill Emmott, the journalist whose damning documentary about Italy called Girlfriend in a Coma has been touring Italy in recent weeks. The Twitter handle of his film succinctly remarked: \"Monti in a Coma. What a waste.\" A day before, Emmott, a former editor of the Economist, had tweeted that the 69-year-old was the \"only choice\" for the country. Italians, it seemed, did not agree.\n\nBattered by 13 months of the technocrat government's austerity measures, many voters had grown to loathe Monti for \u2013 as they saw it \u2013 turning the screw on them with tax hikes when they were already struggling in a recession. Others going to the polls said they recognised he had done a necessary and unenviable job of saving the country from financial disaster \u2013 but that it was now time for someone new.\n\nSince Monti delighted the markets in December by announcing his intention to enter politics, he has undergone an unlikely image transformation from mild-mannered professor to sharp-tongued electoral candidate. He has lashed out at his rivals, deriding Silvio Berlusconi as a \"pied piper\" leading Italy to doom and exhorting the Democratic party leader Pier Luigi Bersani to dump his leftwing allies. He even, on one occasion, suffered the indignity of cuddling a puppy for the camera.\n\nBut with the memory of his reform agenda still fresh in their memories, Italian voters do not appear to have wanted more of the same. James Walston of the American University of Rome said the poor showing was partly down to the fact that, in abandoning his neutrality and entering the political sphere, Monti had lost his key strength. But it was also, he said, simply that alongside Beppe Grillo and Berlusconi, the dry, understated economist had found it difficult to shine in the campaign. \"He messed up as a performer,\" said Walston. \"He was surpassed by two master performers, and even by Bersani.\""}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/14/super-mario-mario-monti", "page_content": "Mario\n\nAge: 30.\n\nJob: Plumber.\n\nSidelines: Carpenter, doctor, archaeologist.\n\nAntagonist: Bowser, an evil turtle with an unwelcome fondness for young women.\n\nAllies: His brother Luigi, Toad, Princess Peach.\n\nQuest: To restore order to Mushroom World and rescue Princess Peach.\n\nMethods: Power-ups, jumping, collecting coins.\n\nGreatest achievement: Preventing arch-nemesis Bowser from taking over the universe.\n\nClassic line: \"It's a-me, Mario!\"\n\nMario Monti\n\nAge: 68.\n\nJob: Italian prime minister-designate.\n\nSidelines: Advisor to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAntagonist: Silvio Berlusconi.

He then pursued graduate studies at Yale University under the tutelage of American economist James Tobin. Monti taught briefly at the University of Trento (1969\u201370) and began a post at the University of Turin (1970\u201379) before returning to Bocconi University in 1971 as a professor of monetary theory and policy. He later directed (1985\u201394) the school\u2019s Institute of Economics. In 1989 he became rector of the university, and five years later he was named its president.\n\nAs a consultant to one of Italy\u2019s largest banks in the 1970s, Monti gained attention for publishing his own estimates of the country\u2019s money supply at a time when official figures were not publicly available. Beginning the following decade, he served on several committees of the Italian treasury and was president of SUERF (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Universitaire Europ\u00e9enne de Recherches Financi\u00e8res; now the European Money and Finance Forum) in 1982\u201385. Also during this time Monti wrote commentaries on economics for the Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera (1978\u201394) and sat on a number of corporate boards.\n\nIn 1995 Monti, having been nominated by Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, took a seat on the European Commission (EC), for which he oversaw issues relating to the internal market, financial services, and taxation. Receiving a second term in 1999, he became the European commissioner for competition, and in that capacity, he took a tough-minded approach to proposed corporate mergers and antitrust cases that won him wide respect. After his EC tenure concluded in 2004, he helped found Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank with a focus on economic globalization.\n\nIn November 2011, in the wake of a public debt crisis in Italy that weakened Berlusconi\u2019s grip on power, the politically independent Monti became a leading candidate to assume the country\u2019s premiership in a national unity government. (It was hoped that Monti\u2019s experience as a technocrat would prove beneficial in the implementation of urgent economic reforms.) On November 9 he was made a lifetime member of the Italian Senate, and four days later, upon Berlusconi\u2019s resignation, Pres. Giorgio Napolitano asked Monti to form a government.\n\nInitially serving as both prime minister and finance minister (he held the latter post until July 2012), Monti swiftly persuaded parliament to approve an austerity package that relied heavily on tax increases. In early 2012 a set of measures he introduced in an effort to liberalize the service sector was also passed. Although Italy continued to face economic uncertainty, Monti\u2019s decisive leadership was widely judged to have helped the country forestall disaster. As the year continued, he also emerged as a key player in international negotiations aimed at financially stabilizing the entire euro zone.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He resigned from office shortly thereafter, remaining in a caretaker role until a new government could be formed. In early elections held in February 2013, Monti led an alliance of centrist political factions, but they failed to win enough parliamentary seats to play a significant role in the ensuing efforts to build a government coalition. After two months of political deadlock, Monti was finally succeeded by Enrico Letta, a Democratic Party (Partito Democratico) leader appointed by Napolitano."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/world/europe/mario-monti-italys-new-leader-faces-uphill-fight.html", "page_content": "ROME \u2014 In the news media he is known simply as \u201cSuper Mario.\u201d But Mario Monti, the likely leader of Italy\u2019s new government, which is being formed amid a crisis that threatens the European monetary union itself, will face a strong challenge in living up to his admiring nickname as he tries to steer his country from the brink of economic turmoil and through the machinations of Italian politics.\n\nThe consensus in Italy is that President Giorgio Napolitano, who nominated Mr. Monti in record time on Sunday to replace departing Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, had chosen judiciously, picking an economist with strong European credentials and longstanding familiarity with Europe\u2019s power brokers.\n\nIt remains to be seen, however, whether Mr. Monti \u2014 who has no hands-on political experience at home \u2014 can convince financial markets that he can overcome Italy\u2019s snarled domestic politics and implement the cost-saving measures that Italy has promised to whittle down a mountain of debt and boost growth.\n\n\u201cMr. Monti brings credibility and legitimacy, but also the notion that if he fails and his efforts fail, everyone will be worse off,\u201d said Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm, a senior associate in the international economics program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, who knows Mr. Monti. \u201cThe bottom line is that Italians have lost their alibi once Berlusconi is gone and the hard work starts; there are no excuses any more.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.italyonthisday.com/2016/03/mario-monti-prime-minister-technocrat-varese-milan-super-mario.html", "page_content": "\n\n\n\n\u2018Super Mario\u2019 steps in during debt crisis\n\n\n\n\n\nMario Monti was Prime Minister of Italy\n\nfrom 2011 to 2013\n\nEconomist Mario Monti, who was Prime Minister of Italy from 2011 to 2013, was born on this day in 1943 in Varese in Lombardy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonti was invited by Italian President Giorgio Napolitano to form a new Government after the resignation of Silvio Berlusconi in November 2011 in the middle of the European debt crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonti, who was the 54th Prime Minister of Italy, led a Government of technocrats, who introduced austerity measures in Italy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonti was born in Varese and, after attending a private school, went to Bocconi University in Milan, where he obtained a degree in Economics.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was a European Commissioner from 1994 to 1999, where he obtained the nickname \u2018Super Mario\u2019 from his colleagues and the Press.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1999 the Prime Minister at the time, Massimo D\u2019Alema, appointed him to the new Prodi Commission, giving him responsibility for Competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nSilvio Berlusconi\n\nHe was made a lifetime senator by Giorgio Napolitano in November 2011 and a few days later he was invited to form a new Government following Berlusconi\u2019s resignation.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe appointed a technocratic cabinet composed entirely of unelected professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey introduced austerity measures to try to stem the worsening economic conditions in Italy.

Source: guardian.co.uk guardian.co.uk\n\nThe sober economist incongruously nicknamed \"Super Mario\" received a hero's welcome in the Italian parliamenton Friday as markets around the world toasted his expected appointment as Italy's prime minister.\n\nSeldom can grey-suited shoulders have borne heavier responsibilities than those implicitly taken on by the former EU commissioner, Mario Monti, when he arrived in the upper house of parliament to take his seat as a life senator. Italian senators hope he can save his country from default, the euro from collapse \u2013 and the world economy from depression.\n\nMonti had been given his seat by President Giorgio Napolitano in a clear sign the head of state intended asking him to form a new government when Silvio Berlusconi leaves office.\n\nThat could now happen as early as evening. After giving Monti a rousing ovation, the members of the senate passed a package of economic measures agreed with the EU last month.\n\nThe measures are expected to be given final approval by the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, on Saturday, clearing the way for Berlusconi's resignation and the appointment of a new government before the markets reopen on Monday. After losing his parliamentary majority this week, Berlusconi said he would remain in office until the package had been approved.\n\nThe measures, aimed at reducing Italy's budget deficit and liberalising its economy, passed with 156 votes in favour, 12 against and one abstention. Italy's main opposition movement, the Democratic party, did not vote. Nor did the Christian Democrat Centre Union.\n\nMarkets shrugged off the questions still surrounding the prospective Monti administration. The spread \u2013 the gap between the yields on Italian and German benchmark bonds, which is a measure of the extra risk of an Italian default \u2013 shrank to 4.6 percentage points. The interest rate on its 10-year BTP bonds fell below 6.5% \u2014 uncomfortably high, but well below the psychologically crucial 7% level that has triggered a bailout for other troubled euro zone states.\n\nThe Milan bourse ended one of the worst weeks in its history with a 3.68% surge that took the FTSE MIB index to 15,778 points. It was the best performance among the leading European stock markets.\n\nBut, as dealers left for the weekend, allies and followers of Berlusconi's government were coming and going from his home in Rome as talks continued on where they should stand in the abruptly changed political landscape. The Northern League, which has 59 of the 630 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, has said it will go into opposition, joining an anti-corruption movement, the Italy of Principles party which commands 22 votes.\n\nThe prime minister's party, the Freedom People party (PdL) is deeply and acrimoniously split over whether to join, back or oppose the expected Monti government. Its formerly neo-fascist wing favours a hard line and a snap election instead of a government with no popular mandate. Berlusconi's personal following is divided.\n\nTo prevent a split, it was thought likely the PdL, which can still muster around 249 votes in the lower house, would support, but not form part of the government. But since the unelected Monti could hardly form a cabinet made up of opposition politicians, that would probably mean a new government composed entirely of non-party \"technocrats\".\n\nThe president of the European council, Herman Van Rompuy, who was due to meet Berlusconi in Rome on Fridaylast night, quipped that Italy \"needs reforms, not elections\". But an exclusively technocratic Monti government would clearly have a problem of democratic legitimacy and a shorter life expectancy than one in which all or most of Italy's political parties were represented. It could also be uncomfortably dependent on the continuing goodwill of the PdL.\n\nThe tensions within Berlusconi's party burst into the open following an Italian news agency report about the foreign minister, Franco Frattini, who wants the PdL to join the next government. It quoted him as having described his adversaries within the party as \"these fascists\".\n\nAsked about the comment, a leading former neo-fascist, the defence minister, Ignazio La Russa, said \"Frattini? Frattini who?\"\n\nThe commission of the chamber that has to give the thumbs up to the economic measures before they can be approved by the full house was also meeting and its deliberations were expected to go on well into the night. The package includes changes to the pension system and the labour market, a reform of the professions, a programme for the sale of state assets and local services, and reforms affecting the public sector.\n\nMonti's singular nickname comes from the eponymous Nintendo video game, first released in 1985.

Demotix/Ermes Beltrami Vincenzi. All rights reserved.\n\nIt is November 2011, Italy\u2019s borrowing interest rates have risen to 7.5%, the spread between Italian government bonds (BTP) and German \u2018bunds\u2019 is over 500, and the markets are plummeting. Italy is gasping for breath.\n\nMario Monti, an unassuming professor, is called to rescue Italy from the precipice. He introduces an emergency austerity budget, which includes higher taxes, pension and work reform, and anti-tax evasion measures. A new era begins. Italy is cleansed of Berlusconi\u2019s debauchery, broken promises and compromises. Did Mario Monti save Italy?\n\nThe savage attack of the markets on Italy was unwarranted. Italy had a primary surplus and a strong manufacturing industry, notwithstanding the strangling red tape, taxes, and absurd labour laws. The crisis, for Italy, was the result of the markets panicking in the belief that Europeans would not stick together. After all, that\u2019s what they were being told repeatedly by American and British commentators.\n\nThey got it wrong, as Philip Stephens explains in the Financial Times. European politicians kept the show on the road and Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, rescued the euro by guaranteeing liquidity to banks. So what did Mario Monti do?\n\nMonti\u2019s measures reassured markets and European partners that Italy had learnt its lesson and was beginning to put its house in order. This allowed Monti to shift the discourse in Europe towards growth. In Italy, Monti talked like a liberal, behaved impeccably, even renouncing his salary, and proved authoritative, but he ultimately failed the task of making Italy fit for the twenty-first century.\n\nThis is not just Goldman Sachs\u2019 opinion, but also that of most Italians who feel let down by the man who gave them hope at a time of despair. There may be many reasons why Monti did not succeed, including lack of time, his own character and ability, and old fashioned obstructive politics. Yet, the picture that emerges is one where the chosen man, endowed with power from above, has squandered his chances.\n\nA closer look at Monti\u2019s failure shows that it is not so much a question of \u2018unfinished business\u2019, as one that never began. Important reforms, such as that of the justice system were carried out well although lacking the necessary parliamentary time, but the most important ones have been a fudge. Monti did not manage to face up to the unions protecting closed shops, did not fully liberalise closed professions, such as pharmacists, taxi drivers, lawyers, notaries etc., neither did he cut bloated public spending.\n\nHe looked like a liberal, talked like a liberal but was not a liberal. Although hated by the Italian public, the work and pensions reforms are the only ones that begin to tackle Italy\u2019s ills. Yet, of these two, the reform on pensions is marred by technical problems - so much for a technocratic government!\n\nThe crisis is far from over and Italians are in the strait-jacket of high taxation, closed professions, and a reduction in consumer spending. The total tax rate on businesses is around 68,3% in Italy, against 46,8% of Germany, 35,5% of the UK, 65% of France, 38,7% of Spain (source, in Italian).\n\nItaly\u2019s property tax, now the highest in Europe, has brought the housing market to a standstill. Businesses have been going bankrupt while waiting for the government to pay for the work for which they were contracted. Yet, in the past ten years, public spending has increased from 600bn to around 800bn (source, in Italian).\n\nTrade unions, professionals, civil servants and politicians have guarded their narrow interests in such a way that makes reform impossible, and Monti will never enjoy the same degree of power he had as a Prime Minister backed by nearly all the members of parliament.\n\nSo it is difficult to understand why he has not done more - and why he has now entered politics, going back on his word. Mario Monti is tapping on the great resource of Italian \u2018civil society\u2019, which, in the past ten years, has taken the step of entering politics in the form of \u2018civic lists\u2019 at local elections. This is something that others, notably the comedian Beppe Grillo, are also doing.\n\nThe difference is that Grillo\u2019s \u2018civic society\u2019 is comprised of \u2018ordinary\u2019 citizens, while Monti\u2019s is crowded by academics and professionals, so much so that the right-wing newspaper il Giornale called it the \u2018Monticarlo\u2019 list.\n\nThe main fault of Monti is not so much his patronising attitude or his posse of hard-nosed academics, but his lack of understanding of power. He was granted power from above when he became Prime Minister without ever standing for elections. He was also appointed as a European Commissioner and academic. This is not to question his hard work and ability, rather to point out that \u2018appointment\u2019 gives one a different perspective on one\u2019s position.\n\nAppointment comes from above and vests one with power on the basis of abilities to be exercised according to one\u2019s better judgement. Democracy is the government of people, who elect candidates to be their representatives, to speak and act on their behalf.\n\nIn a representative democracy, people are the \u2018sovereign\u2019, not subjects: thus representation requires politicians to act in accordance with the views and values expressed by the people. Monti\u2019s political venture, however, is fought from the comfort of his (appointed) seat in the Senate without actually facing the electorate.\n\nOf democracy, Monti seems to be learning the tricks of political campaigning with aid from David Axelrod, a former advisor to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, and the chief strategist of the latter's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.\n\nAt any rate, Monti's movement is polling between 10% and 12%. He has an alliance with two veterans of Italian politics, Gianfranco Fini and Pierferdinando Casini, who increase the share of the vote to 14-15%, but bring with them the baggage of a history of previous obstruction to reform.\n\nAs the elections approach, Europe looks on in trepidation. The last thing \u2018they\u2019 want is a return to Berlusconi or a Democrats\u2019 government of higher spending. Monti is still admired in Europe, while Italians have begun to see him as too soft with Germany, which has been profiting from the crisis through negative borrowing interest rates while Italy was financially aiding Greece. He is also seen as too close to \u2018the banks\u2019, arguably the most hated economic sector in Europe.\n\nYet Monti might take enough votes to force Bersani, the leader of the left-wing Partito Democratico, into a coalition government. It might be enough to pursue further reforms, but not to free Italy of the shackles of closed shop corporatism, a Byzantine, slow and iniquitous justice system, and an overpowering bureaucracy.\n\nSome Italians express the very peninsular view of Italy being \u2018a case apart\u2019, different from anywhere else, which will never be truly \u2018European\u2019. But lately, after spending nearly two months in Italy, I saw something breathing, moving and, at times, screaming. It is a liberal reformism that is being taken forward by men and women in local and national politics. Not content to fall prey to populist fears and hollow electoral promises, Italians are daring to express their aspirations for a real future. The revolution has already begun, but that\u2019s for another election."}]}
