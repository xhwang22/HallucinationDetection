The band's original lineup included Sal Valentino (lead vocals), Ron Elliott (lead guitar and main songwriter), Ron Meagher (bass guitar), Declan Mulligan (rhythm guitar, bass, harmonica), and John Petersen (drums). The Beau Brummels were discovered by Autumn Records, where Sylvester Stewart\u2014later known as Sly Stone\u2014produced the group's early recording sessions. Initially, the band's musical style blended beat music and folk music, and has been described as early and influential folk rock. Much like their contemporaries, The Byrds, their early music drew comparisons to the Beatles. Their later work incorporated other music genres such as psychedelic rock and country rock.\n\nThe Beau Brummels broke into the mainstream with their debut single, \"Laugh, Laugh\", for which they would later be credited for setting the aesthetic foundation for the San Francisco Sound. The band's popularity continued with the subsequent album, 1965's Introducing the Beau Brummels, and the Top 10 single \"Just a Little\". The group's commercial success declined by the following year, at which time the financially struggling Autumn label was acquired by Warner Bros. Records. After recording an album of cover songs, Beau Brummels '66, the band released a pair of critically acclaimed albums: Triangle in 1967 and Bradley's Barn in 1968.\n\nThe band underwent several personnel changes, beginning with Mulligan's departure in 1965. Guitarist Don Irving joined the band in late 1965 when Elliott began to suffer seizures resulting from a diabetic condition, leaving him unable to tour with the band. Shortly after the release of Beau Brummels '66, Irving left the group when he was inducted into the armed forces. Petersen left to join Harpers Bizarre, reducing the Beau Brummels to a trio for the recording of Triangle. Meagher was drafted for military service in 1968, leaving Valentino and Elliott as the only remaining band members. The duo worked with prominent Nashville session musicians to record Bradley's Barn before parting ways in 1969 to focus on solo material and participate in projects by other artists. The five original Beau Brummels reformed in 1974, and the band released an eponymous album the following year."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ron-meagher-mn0001198834/credits", "page_content": "Credits Ron Meagher Follow Artist +\n\nRon Meagher was bassist in the Beau Brummels.

The band is especially recognized in the evolution of the country-rock music genre and what has come to be referred to as the San Francisco Sound.\n\nThe band whose original lineup was made up of a group of friends were discovered by local disc jockeys with a new record label looking for musicians to sign. In their early career, their sound was a blend of folk and beat music but as their career progressed, they incorporated various musical genres like country rock and psychedelic rock.\n\nThe band was active between 1964 to 1969 and then 1974 to 1975. Some of their well-received songs like Laugh, Laugh has made it to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the songs that shaped Rock and Roll. During the height of their popularity, they were considered teen idols and appeared on various television music variety shows like Shindig, American Bandstand, Hullabaloo, and films like Wild Wild Winter and Village of Giants.\n\nWho are the members of The Beau Brummels Rock Band?\n\nSal Valentino was the brain behind the band when it first began. He was the one who dreamed of it before going on to introduce others to form The Beau Brummels.\n\nHe began to perform at a young age with a series of appearances on television. His performances got him a regular gig at a club (El Cid, San Francisco). To form a much-needed band he called on his childhood friend Ron Elliot who was a guitarist and songwriter. Ron then recruited the other members which included Declan Mulligan (singer/ rhythm guitarist), Ron Meagher (bassist), and Victor Savant (pianist).\n\nAs they performed at the club, they got a more lucrative deal to perform at another club (Morocco Room, San Mateo, California. The owner of the club (Rich Romanello) invited disc jockeys Tom Donahue and Bobby Mitchell to listen to them at the club as they were looking for new acts to sign to their upcoming record label (Autumn Records). They quickly signed them and their early records were produced by Sly Stone.\n\nThe Beau Brummels band\u2019s original members include the following\n\nSal Valentino as lead vocalist, tambourine. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Elliott as lead guitarist, backing vocals and occasional lead vocals. (1964- 1969, 1974-75)\n\nRon Meagher as bassist and backing vocals (1964- 1967, 1974)\n\nDeclan Mulligan as the rhythm guitarist, backing vocals and harmonica.(1964- 1965, 1974-75)\n\nJohn Peterson as the drummer. (1964- 1966, 1974-75)\n\nThe subsequent members of The Beau Brummels include\n\nDon Irving as guitarist and backing vocals. (1965-1966)\n\nDan Levitt played the banjo and guitar (1974-1975)\n\nPeter Tepp played the drums for their 1975 tour.\n\nAs much as they tried to keep it together, the band naturally went through changes in personnel over time. Mulligan left the band in 1965 and was replaced by Don Irving.\n\nElliott left the group next as he constantly suffered seizures due to his diabetic condition. So he had difficulty touring with the band.\n\nIn 1966, Irving got inducted into the armed forces so had to leave. Peterson left the band to join Harpers Bizarre. Meagher was also drafted into the military.\n\nIn 1974, four of the original members with a new member came together to work on another album which was then released in 1975.\n\nWhere are they?\n\nAfter recording a self-titled studio album that was released in 1975, The Beau Brummels members split up again but continued to appear in several incarnations between the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. They featured in shows alongside The Dinosaurs, The Smithereens, and performed at shows like the Baypop Festival 2000, Summer of Love Festival 2002.\n\nDespite the band split of several years, Valentino didn\u2019t release his first solo album until 2006. The album was titled Dreamin\u2019 Man and he went ahead to release two more solo albums in late 2006 and 2008. Unfortunately, John Peterson died on the 11th of November 2007 due to a heart attack.\n\nAs recently as 2013, the original band members came together again to record a studio album that was released on Bay Sound Records in March. The new album contained fifteen songs written by Elliott and some drum tracks recorded by late Peterson in 1965. They did the re-recording of some of their well-known songs including \u201cLaugh, Laugh\u201d, \u201cJust a Little\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Talk to Strangers\u201d.\n\nAlthough the band members continue to concentrate on their individual lives and careers, the band remains a favorite for Classic Rock Lovers."}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Ron_Meagher", "page_content": "Main article: The Beau Brummels\n\nWhen guitarist-songwriter Ron Elliott was putting the band together in 1964, he asked a friend, Kay Dane, if she knew any good bass players.[1] Dane recommended Meagher, but cautioned, \"He's kind of weird. He has long hair!\"[1] After joining the band, Meagher proved to be important to the band's image, as he was one of the first American rock musicians with Beatlesque hair.[2] In addition to providing backing vocals, Meagher sang lead on occasion, as on \"They'll Make You Cry,\" a song from the band's 1965 debut album, Introducing the Beau Brummels.[2] Meagher appeared with the band in the 1965 science-fiction/comedy movie Village of the Giants, which was featured in a 1994 episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000.[3] He remained with the band as it reduced from a quintet to a trio by 1967's critically acclaimed album Triangle.[4]\n\nDuring the recording of the band's next album, 1968's Bradley's Barn, Meagher was drafted, becoming one of the few musicians from a well-known rock band to serve in the military at the height of the Vietnam War.[2] Over the next three decades, Meagher has also participated in several Beau Brummels revivals, most notably in the mid-1970s when the band released a 1975 self-titled reunion album.[5] After he was discharged two years later, Meagher played in the Black Velvet Band with former Beau Brummels bandmate Declan Mulligan.[2]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nMain article: The Beau Brummels discography\n\nReferences [ edit ]"}, {"url": "https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/25495/do-musicians-that-began-playing-from-an-early-age-have-an-incontestable-advantag", "page_content": "I don't have a source handy, but I believe that whole \"impressionable age\" (or whatever it was called) theory has been debunked. There is no cutoff age after which learning is any harder. However, I do believe there is a psychological factor that shapes confidence and comfort, and I'll use myself as the explanatory example:\n\nI started piano at age 4, young enough that I don't remember my first piano lessons (and that entire first year or so is hazy) and I don't remember what it's like to not know how to read music. I certainly remember not being a good sight reader and taking a long time to get even simple lines under my fingers, but I don't remember looking at a music staff and not knowing what the lines and dots meant. This is pretty much exactly how I'm sure nobody really remembers what it's like to not know how to read or speak. To my memory, reading music and being able to play piano (to some degree) are things I've simply always been able to do. And that gives it a sense of innateness that will be lacking in those who started later.\n\nNow, that isn't a superpower, and anyone that's also been playing for 23 years can easily have the same amount of skill as me (and to be honest, probably more). But the fact that I've simply \"always been doing it\" gives me an extra degree of comfort and familiarity around music. How much that's worth is up for debate.\n\nI can't name you any famous musicians who started later in life off the top of my head, mainly because I'm not familiar with the backgrounds of most musicians. However it is certainly true that most of them got started young. Really though, I would say this is a matter of time and experience and not any kind of advantage specific to starting young. A 30-year-old musician who started at 5 vs. one who started at 20 is just not a fair comparison. Combine that with the fact that there are far more musicians than there is room for professionals, and the ones that started young are naturally going to bubble to the top much more frequently than those who didn't."}, {"url": "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/you-dont-have-to-start-young-to-be-a-great-musician/", "page_content": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart began his musical training at the tender age of three. By age five, he had already composed his first piece of music. As a child, he mastered the piano, along with several other instruments including the violin, organ and harpsichord. By all accounts, he was a child prodigy. But he was far from the only composer to have a head start: Ludwig van Beethoven, Martha Argerich, Vincenzo Bellini, Claudio Arrau, and many of history\u2019s greatest musicians all began their training in early childhood and went on to wow the world.\n\nThe success of these musicians raises the question: Do you need to start early to be great? Many of us assume that the younger we start, the better our chances of becoming the best. Certain research backs up this claim. Some psychologists have even suggested that there may be a key period in early childhood when we have a particularly powerful capacity to absorb musical aptitude. According to this view, if you wait until your teens or even early adulthood to begin your training, you will have missed a critical window.\n\nYet a new study by Laura Wesseldijk of Vrije University Amsterdam and her colleagues challenges this view: It explores the possibility that environmental and familial factors are the driving forces behind the success of \u201cearly starters.\u201d Such individuals may have an edge not because they learn in a developmentally unique period but because they inherit talent, have access to instruments and instruction, or get a head start on practice. So it is possible that starting late might not prevent you from becoming great.\n\nWhen comparing early starters to late bloomers, one critical factor to consider is total practice time. We know that practice matters because it can take thousands of hours to achieve expertise. Any study seeking to isolate the benefits of early exposure has to match training time for those who start early versus late in life. But there is a challenge in matching total training time: late bloomers with extensive practice tend to be much older than early starters with the same practice. Given that some kinds of cognitive performance often start to decline in early adulthood, comparing old late bloomers to young early starters could inflate the advantages of beginning young.\n\nTo add to the challenge, practice time and age are not the only factors to consider. Imagine you are the child of a concert pianist. It is possible that some aspects of musical talent have a genetic component, and if so, you may have inherited a predisposition to excel musically. Even if you did not, you are raised in a musically-enriched environment, with a piano in your home and a parent who plays regularly. Either your natural talent or your experience, or both, may lead you to begin banging on the piano keys as a toddler. Lucky for you, you have a parent with the knowledge and expertise to nurture that interest. You are indeed an early starter, but you also have familial and environmental advantages that could accelerate your musical development.\n\nWesseldijk and her colleagues explored the effect of these familial and environmental influences by assessing musical aptitude and expertise in two independent populations\u2014professional musicians and adult twins with musical experience. By including professional musicians, the researchers assessed aptitude and expertise in a cohort of highly trained, active experts who had begun their training at varying ages (from age two to 18). Through studying identical twins, the researchers could examine differences in aptitude and expertise for pairs of individuals who shared the same familial environment and genetic predispositions but may have started their training at different times.\n\nMore than 300 musicians and 7,000 twins participated in the study, and they ranged in age from 27 to 54. The musicians selected were still active in the field, and each of the twins had received musical training at some point in their lives. Participants reported the age at which they started to play and the hours they practiced each week during different age intervals (for example, six to 11 years and 12 to 17 years). Using this information, the researchers estimated the age of onset of training and accumulated practice for each participant. Participants also completed two online assessments: one for musical aptitude and the other for musical achievement. The aptitude test measured the basic musical skills of pitch, melody and rhythm discrimination. The achievement test evaluated different metrics of musical success, including the body of composed and performed works, number of awards, national and international reviews, and pieces featured in public performances.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings suggest that early starters do not benefit from a critical developmental window for cultivating skill and expertise but rather from additional hours of practice, the experience of growing up in a musically engaged family and perhaps even a genetic predisposition for musical prowess. They first examined the relation between starting early and later musical aptitude and achievement in both the musician and twin samples, controlling for total practice time. In this analysis, an earlier start in musical training was associated with higher scores on some aptitude measures but not higher musical achievement. In other words, when total practice was held constant, individuals who were exposed to music at an early age showed higher scores on the basic skill of pitch discrimination\u2014yet they were no more likely than late bloomers to have their music played on the radio or in public concerts, to win awards, or to receive national or international reviews.\n\nTo understand the contribution that genes and environment play in musical prowess, researchers turned to the twin data. Researchers estimated genetic and environmental factors by comparing identical twins to each other, to fraternal twins (who share only 50% of their genes on average), and to experienced musicians in the general population. If there is no genetic component to musical talent, then the data from identical twin pairs should be similar to data from fraternal twin pairs. Similarly, if familial environment has no influence on musical success, then data for twins reared together should look the same as data for unrelated musicians. Not surprisingly, the findings suggest that heredity and environment do contribute to musical aptitude and achievement. When the researchers further controlled for these genetic and environmental influences, an early start was no longer predictive of musical aptitude. Put simply: the early starters didn\u2019t score higher on the aptitude tests because they began their training earlier but because of genetic and environmental factors that gave them an edge. Children who have a natural talent for music and/or a musically gifted parent are more likely to be exposed to music at an early age and have their talent nurtured. These factors explain the advantage that early starters have over late bloomers with respect to musical skill.\n\nSo we can all take a breath and relax if we (or our children) failed to start playing a musical instrument by the age of five. You didn\u2019t miss the window because, as the findings demonstrate, no such window exists. If your passion for the piano emerges in your teens or even in adulthood, you are not destined for mediocrity. Those of us learning to play later in life can still aspire to greatness, just as Bill Withers, who began his musical career in his late 20s, still managed to write and produce award-winning music and to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. That said, one essential ingredient in the recipe for success is practice. If you don\u2019t get an early start, you may need to stay up late, putting in the hours\u2014practice makes perfect."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/23/a-new-obsession-the-people-who-learnt-to-play-instruments-during-lockdown", "page_content": "Many people dream of playing the piano or learning the guitar, but what about the Celtic harp?

Her teacher lives in the US and Melling fits her music lessons in between her university Zoom classes.\n\n\u201cIt looks a bit like a large violin and you play it on your lap,\u201d she said. \u201cI had visions of myself on a swinging chair on a porch, playing the dulcimer while taking swigs out of a bottle of whiskey, maybe with a blacked-out tooth too.\u201d\n\nMelling is one of thousands of adults who have taken up an instrument during lockdown.

Jimi started playing at the age of 15, and despite his life being cut short at only 27, in the span of 12 years he became one of the greatest guitarists of all time.\n\nHis journey started with a one-stringed ukulele which he would fiddle to produce different melodies and play along to Elvis songs. While exploring the instrument he learned timing and rhythm despite not having all 6 strings.\n\nHis first guitar was an acoustic one gifted by his father that cost $5, shortly after, he got a Supro electric guitar that was stolen. This made way for \"Betty Jean\", a Danelectro Shorthorn guitar, named after his girlfriend at the time. The relationship didn't last, but the guitar would accompany him at the beginning of his career.\n\nHendrix started to learn licks and chords from guitarists in the Seattle area. But mostly, he would listen to the radio at home and play along, learning by ear the guitar sections of his favorite songs. That dedication led him to practice 8-12 hours a day, spending his entire free time playing the guitar. Jimi was naturally left-handed, but his father insisted that he played right-handed. The solution was to take the right-handed guitar and restrung it for playing left-handed granting some of the uniqueness of his sound.\n\nIt might seem surprising after seeing him shine on stage, but Jimi had a shy personality and almost got discouraged at age 17 after playing with his first group. Other guitarists around him seemed so much better and more confident.\n\nThe idea of giving up crossed his mind, but he decided to keep on going. It was when he started playing with Little Richard that he learned how to entertain an audience and dress to impress. These lessons helped Jimi to become the best performer of the 1960s. Only 9 years after first picking up the guitar, he was able to release the iconic album \u201cAre You Experienced\u201d. It shows that passion and commitment to practice are the key ingredients to determine how far you can go on your guitar learning journey.\n\nIn an interview for Guitar Player magazine, Hendrix gave some advice for those starting to learn: \u201cYou have to stick with it. Sometimes, you are going to be so frustrated you want to give up the guitar - you\u2019ll hate the guitar. But all of this is just a part of learning because if you stick with it, you\u2019re going to be rewarded\u201d.\n\nElizabeth Cotten - a self-taught unique style\n\nAt the age of seven, Elisabeth Cotten fell in love. The object of her affection was a homemade banjo that belonged to her older brother. While he was out at work, she would sneak into his room to play it. But it wasn\u2019t long before broken strings revealed her secret. Even though her brother complained, he never stopped her from playing.\n\nWhile trying to understand the strings and their sounds, little Elizabeth found her own way. Cotten was left-handed like Hendrix and unaware of string structures, learned to play the instrument upside down instead of having the banjo restrung. She played the tremble strings with her thumb and the bass strings with her index finger. Later on, she tried to learn with the standard strings setup, only to decide hers was the best method, and continued to learn on her own.\n\nWhen her brother left home, taking the banjo with him, Cotten\u2019s desire to keep making music brought her knocking door to door looking for work. Soon she was able to buy her first guitar, a Stella acoustic. Inspired by guitarists of the time, traveling musicians, and minstrel shows, Cotten mastered the guitar and composed her most famous song, \u201cFreight Train\u201d, when she was only 12 years old.\n\nHowever, the deserved recognition of her musical talent came much later in her life. At 68, she established herself as one of the main figures in the folk revival of 1960. The exposure brought her music to bigger audiences and later made her a Grammy-winner recording artist.\n\nProud of her own self-taught journey, she was known to always share with her audiences: \u201cNobody did teach me. Everything I know, I learned all by myself, so I give myself all the credit!\u201d.\n\nJoni Mitchell - sometimes you have to learn it twice\n\nJoni Mitchell is still a voice that speaks through generations. Her Blue album went number 1 on iTunes in 2021, exactly 50 years after its first release. One thing you might not know is that the Canadian musician had to learn twice how to play the guitar in her lifetime.\n\nShe first became interested in music when she started studying at Alberta College of Art in Calgary. At that time, Mitchell started to get familiar with the ukulele. It wasn\u2019t long before the guitar made its way into her life, along with Pete Seeger\u2019s \u201cHow to Play Folk-Style Guitar\u201d instructional record. After some initial training with the record, she decided it was time to experiment by herself, \u201cI didn\u2019t have the patience to copy a style that was already known\u201d, shared Mitchell in a Rolling Stone interview in 1969. In the search for her sound, Joni also had another influence, \u201cI went straight to the Cotten picking. So Elizabeth Cotten definitely is an influence; it's me not being able to play like her. If I could have I would have, but good thing I couldn't, because it came out original\u201d. From there on, Mitchell kept experimenting with different guitar tunings and harmonies with her own singing that would shape her style.\n\nMitchell still remembers fondly one of her first guitars, an acoustic 56 Martin D-28. It came to her possession around 1966, from a Marine captain stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The guitar had a history, it accompanied the Marine to Vietnam. The guitar was stored in his tent when it was hit by shells. According to Mitchell \"When they cleared the wreckage, all that survived was this guitar. I don't know whether the explosion did something to the modules in the wood, but that guitar was a trooper, man\u201d. That guitar was Joni\u2019s main companion during her early albums. Sadly, it ended up damaged on an airline flight and later on stolen at the airport on a trip to Maui.\n\nIn 2015 a brain aneurism rendered the musician unable to talk or walk. She had to relearn everything, including how to play the guitar again. While recovering, Mitchell taught herself how to play by watching her own performance videos. She would observe her finger placements and how to play the strings, learning everything from scratch. Joni's younger self became her own teacher.\n\nThis year, Joni Mitchell was able to perform again at the Newport festival. Now 78, when asked during an interview about how she felt about being on stage again, she shared \u201cI\u2019m never nervous about performing. I just want it to sound good. I wasn\u2019t sure how it was going to be\u2026 but I think I didn\u2019t sound too bad tonight!\u201d.\n\nSt. Vincent (Anne Clark) - learning on the road\n\nAnne Clark, a singer, songwriter, guitar player, and producer carrying two Grammy awards, first learned to play on a plastic guitar after watching the movie La Bamba. Later on, she began taking guitar classes at 12 years old. According to her uncle, Tuck Andress, in a 2009 New York Times interview, Clark was around 14 years old when she made her first performance, joining her guitar teacher\u2019s band on stage in a club in Dallas.\n\nTuck Andress, a musician himself (best known as half of the jazz duo Tuck & Patti), recognized his niece\u2019s talent and invited her to follow him on the road as a tour manager. She was able to keep practicing and soon became the opening act. Mentored by Andress and surrounded by different sound references, Clark was able to develop her own experimental style with different effect pedals. In an interview to NPR at SXSW in 2014, Clark shared \u201cIn some ways, I feel very reverent about the guitar. I love it so much. But I also don\u2019t care about it being a guitar or sounding like a guitar\u201d.\n\nJoe Satriani - the student becomes the teacher\n\nIf this article is to cover how iconic guitar players learned the guitar, the answer for names like Steve Vai, Kirk Hammett, Alex Skolnick, and David Bryson is the same: Joe Satriani.\n\nOne of the most successful rock instrumentalists, and consistently packing concert halls, Joe Satriani is considered almost a mythical creature among guitar enthusiasts. But every master was also a student, for Satriani that started at the age of 14. He studied directly under two big names in the bebop scene, guitarist Billy Bauer, who used to play with Charlie Parker, and later with pianist Lennie Tristano.\n\nSatriani was working hard at being a self-taught musician but eventually shared with his parents his desire to find a teacher and learn some secrets of music. \u201cMy mother was a teacher, and somebody mentioned to her that this guy from her era (Bauer) was teaching. So my mom asked me if I\u2019d ever heard of him, and I hadn\u2019t, so she set up some lessons\u201d, he recalls in an interview for Jazz Weekly.\n\nThe classes with Bauer were transformative. He highlights the importance of understanding music theory in order to expand his sound \u201cBilly had these pamphlets that he had written himself. They revolutionized my view of the guitar because they had scales in three octaves, scales on separate strings, and arpeggios all over the neck. I was only teaching myself rock music and hadn\u2019t yet put together theory education with the actual fretboard knowledge. Billy was the first one who said 'You just need to learn ALL of this stuff in every single key'\u201d.\n\nTwo years later, when he was 18, Joe Satriani was again in search of a music guru to give him further insight into playing, when a friend recommended he look for Lennie Tristano. He had no idea he was about to be mentored by one of the key figures of Cool Jazz. Satriani later referred to some of that experience as \"Zen lessons\". With Tristano, he understood the importance of also feeling music while playing. \u201cYou can\u2019t leave any dark or unexplored part of your musicianship alone. You have to learn your instrument, the notes, the chords, the melodies, the harmonies, every string, every key everywhere, and then play only the notes that you want to play. Don\u2019t ever play something you don\u2019t want to play, and never be judgmental when you\u2019re improvising.\u201d\n\nAccording to Joe Satriani, that\u2019s a lesson that made him realize that musicianship was really the path for him: \u201cI\u2019m going to work on this until the day I die\u201d.\n\nHow are you going to learn the guitar?\n\nThese inspiring stories are also a reflection of their time. Nowadays making music is even easier, we have access to technology that was considered impossible or even magic in the past.

Unlike most children, I was dying to learn how to play it. My father is a skilled rock guitarist and was always playing in bands when I was growing up. Although I tried my hand at the guitar under his tutelage around the age of 6, it wasn't much for me. The strings made my fingers hurt and it never felt quite right. Instead, I was attracted to the old pump organ we had sitting in our den. I used to poke at its keys and wish it was a piano.\n\nI'm learning more each day how imperative it is to hold on to your hobbies and passions. Those are the things that give your life color. The house chores can wait.\n\nLiving in a rural area, piano teachers weren't easy to come by and despite my parents' best efforts, they weren't able to get me into lessons until I was about 10 years old. This is pretty late in the game for anyone looking to be a serious pianist, but I had an unwavering amount of excitement and determination. At that point in time, I had been attempting to teach myself for about six months using a \"Learn How to Play Keyboard\" self-guided book and a 61-key keyboard that my parents had gifted me for my birthday. My fingers were weak and untrained, and I was lacking even the most basic technical knowledge, but I couldn't be deterred.\n\nI was an avid student. I learned some scales, how to hold my wrists correctly, and grasped playing with both hands simultaneously. Practicing for a couple hours each day, I was able to progress throughout middle and high school and get myself to an intermediate playing level. I started writing my own music and managed to achieve a certain level of local fame, playing paying gigs at outdoor events and coffee shops. I even produced an album of my own music at the age of 15.\n\nThings changed when college hit. Starting my freshman year, my piano practice fell to the wayside. There wasn't any room in my dorm for my little keyboard and the piano in my dorm's lobby was usually out of tune or surrounded by other students. When I was home on break, I would plunk at the keys now and again, but I was out of the habit and unmotivated without lessons to help me consistently improve.\n\nUnlike riding a bike, playing an instrument really does require consistent practice if you want to maintain your skills and level of playing. And I let mine deteriorate.\n\nFast forward about seven years through college, grad school, internships, and two full-time positions, and I found myself seeking more fulfillment out of life. I was married, a homeowner, had a steady job in my chosen industry, and was volunteering in several community organizations \u2014 but there was still something missing.\n\nI spent many days guiltily looking at the digital piano my father and stepmother had gifted me as a graduation gift and wishing I could play like my youthful self. I was embarrassed by how much my skills had faded. When I did occasionally sit down at the keys, I struggled to read the sheet music and my hands were weak and clumsy. I was so incredibly embarrassed and sad. What had once been my greatest form of self expression had now become a token of the past.\n\nOn more than one occasion I considered re-enrolling in piano lessons, but I would always manage to talk myself out of it.\n\n\"I don't have the time.\"\n\n\"I don't have the money.\"\n\n\"I still don't have a real piano.\"\n\nI was making excuses.\n\nIt took me a solid year of consideration and mental back-and-forth before I finally shut down the naysayer in my head and emailed a local piano teacher, asking if she would take me as a student. I clarified that I was an adult with some previous (but extremely rusty) experience \u2014 not an adorable 7-year-old whose young mind would pick up scales like an innate superpower \u2014 and much to my excitement and terror, she offered me a weekly lesson.\n\nI was so nervous going to that first lesson. It had been so long and I felt like a fish out of water. But a year-and-a-half later, I can confidently say that it was one of the best decisions I've made in my adult life. Here's why:\n\nI Regained a Creative Outlet\n\nThere is something raw and cathartic about the music-making process. If you play a musical instrument yourself, then you know exactly what I'm talking about. As a practicing visual artist, writer, and musician, I've learned that I achieve different levels of satisfaction from each practice. Each outlet provides me with a unique way of expressing myself. Music gave me back a piece of my soul that I didn't realize I was missing.\n\nI Started Dedicating Time For Self-Care\n\nHaving a weekly lesson keeps me accountable. I dedicate at least 30 minutes to practicing every day because I've made the commitment to myself and my instructor to be a piano student and work each week to get better. As I know from my college years, not having a scheduled lesson each week made it too easy to not play at all. So often, the first things to be erased from our priority list are the things that bring us joy. I'm learning more each day how imperative it is to hold on to your hobbies and passions. Those are the things that give your life color. The house chores can wait.\n\nI Discovered a New Sense of Fulfillment\n\nI'm a career-motivated person, which means I get a deep sense of accomplishment from my work. But as many of us have experienced, placing all of your happiness and fulfillment in the hands of your employer can be a path laden with frustration. You don't always get the pay or credit you think you deserve or promoted on the timeline you think is appropriate. No matter how much you love your job, work is bound to be occasionally frustrating. Being a piano student allows me to gain a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment outside of the office. I practice every day and take a lesson each week. That means that I do inevitably find myself improving! I'm now venturing into advanced level playing (a goal that once seemed far, far away) and am more comfortable reading sheet music than I've ever been. Frustration fueled at the office feels irrelevant and small when I'm tackling a new piano piece with ease.\n\nI'm Refining a Skill I Get to Pass On\n\nAt 22 weeks pregnant, I'm even more proud of myself now for taking the leap and revisiting my old passion. I love that my baby is treated to Bach, Beethoven, and Tchaikovsky on a regular basis and will be familiar with the sound of music when he comes into the world this fall. In my own form of nesting, my husband and I recently purchased a barely used piano for our home. It was important to me that we have a piano before our son's arrival so that the world of music would always be accessible to him. Whether my son chooses to pursue music or not, I'm proud demonstrating the importance of pursuing one's passions.\n\nNot everyone has an interest in learning to play a musical instrument, but many of us do have hobbies or passions that we've allowed to fall to the wayside in our adult lives. For those of you who have a nagging voice in your head, saying, \"I wish I could get back to . . .\" or \"I wish I had time for . . .\" my advice is this: make time. Do things just for the fun of it (not everything has to be a side hustle!). Prioritize yourself once in a while. Stand up to your own insecurities. Find what brings you joy and pursue it fearlessly. Fill your life with the things that give it color."}, {"url": "https://www.fender.com/articles/techniques/how-to-play-bass-guitar", "page_content": "Bass may not get all the glory of the guitar or have the flash, crash, and bang of the drums -- but the instrument holds an important spot in any band, bridging the gap between rhythm and melody. The bass guitar is responsible for creating the undercurrent -- or bassline -- that ties a song together, giving it a rhythmic feel and a steady beat that helps both the guitar and drums propel the song forward.\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll show you some bass guitar basics, helping you get started on your musical journey.

However, bass guitar is the low-end bottom that provides a bridge between the showmanship and melody of the guitar and the driving backbeat of the drums.\n\nNeed another reason to want to learn to play bass? While you may marvel at a guitarist\u2019s string-bending prowess when you listen to a song, when you plug your headphones in, the bass line is usually the part that makes you bob your head.\n\nMany bassists have a firm understanding of the structure of songs and often take a front-seat role in songwriting. Take a look (and listen) to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Paul McCartney of The Beatles, Parliament-Funkadelic\u2019s Bootsy Collins (who also played with Dee-Lite and James Brown), Geddy Lee of Rush, Motley Crue\u2019s Nikki Sixx, and Gene Simmons of KISS, and you have a litany of bassists who have been the songwriting forces behind their respective bands.

For instance, for more tone and guitar-driven songs in the country genre, playing bass may be easier than rhythm-focused genres such as funk or hard rock and heavy metal.\n\nThe physical size and thickness (or gauge) of bass strings of a bass may also make it more challenging for new musicians to learn. However, if you have smaller hands, there are short-scale basses (like the Fender Mustang\u00ae Bass) that can make it easier for you to maneuver up and down the neck of your bass guitar and span a shorter distance between frets.\n\n\u201cEveryone's a beginner at some point. You get better at things by doing them more. You may be a beginner, but you'll get better. I guarantee it.\"\n\n- Mike Dirnt, Green Day\n\nLoading...\n\nBass Guitar Basics\n\nChoosing a Bass Guitar That\u2019s Right for You\n\nAs a beginner, choosing a bass guitar can feel intimidating -- but it doesn\u2019t have to be. From size to tone, to the number of strings and your budget, there are several factors that can help narrow down the right choice for your bass.\n\n\u2022 Size: If you\u2019re a beginner bassist with smaller hands or just want a lighter instrument with a shorter neck to more easily maneuver around the fretboard, a short-scale bass may be the perfect choice. The Fender Mustang Bass, Squier Vintage Modified Jaguar Bass Special SS and Squier Bronco Bass all feature a 30\u201d long neck. Additionally, a lightweight bass may be ideal for individuals who experience back or shoulder pain when playing for extended periods.\n\n\u2022 Tone: The tone a bassist gravitates toward is a matter of personal preference. Depending on your genre of choice and the sound you\u2019re aiming to achieve, different bass guitars will offer their own distinct tone. Want a warmer tone? Opt for a bass from the Fender Squier range. In addition to a warm tone, they offer a thinner neck and profile, ideal for novice bassists and players with small hands. Crave a deeper, more rumbling tone? Look to the Player Precision Bass\u00ae.\n\nIf you have a desire to experiment and tinker with tone, outfitting your electric bass with the right amp or pedals can help you replicate the tones of your favorite artists. The Fender Mustang GTX series of amps is compatible with the Fender Tone app, which allows you to access hundreds of presets to help you sound like your favorite musician without having to string together a ton of effects pedals.\n\n\u2022 Number of strings: While most bass guitars have four strings, there are some five-string models (such as the Fender American Ultra Jazz Bass\u00ae V) that offer players more creative freedom. If you\u2019re just starting out on your musical journey, it may be best to master playing a four-string bass first before branching out. The thinner neck of a four-string bass guitar may be easier for beginners to play. On the flipside, a five-string bass increases the range of notes and scales that can be played.\n\n\u2022 Budget: An instrument is an investment that will last a lifetime. Even if you\u2019re starting out or on a budget, there are plenty of affordable options to find a bass you\u2019ll love for years to come. For instance, the Fender Affinity Series\u2122 Jazz Bass\u00ae packs a legendary sound at under $250. Electric bass bundles are another great choice for bassists on a budget, packaging together a bass, amp, strap, and other accessories to get you started.\n\nStill not sure where to begin? Find your Fender and get paired up with an instrument that speaks to your style and sound.\n\nBass Checklist for Beginners\n\nHaving the right tools is the key to mastering your instrument. There are a few essentials beginner bassists should have to get started:\n\n\u2022 Bass guitar strap - A guitar strap not only helps you to securely hold your instrument in the correct position for playing, but it also helps you show off a bit of your personality and sense of style.\n\n\u2022 Cables - Whether you\u2019re plugging your bass into an amplifier or stringing effects pedals together, cables help make that connection possible.\n\n\u2022 Amps - There\u2019s nothing like the feeling of plugging in your electric bass and hearing its rumble roar to life. Whether you\u2019re cranking it all the way up to 10 or practicing at a lower volume, an amplifier can help you hear the true tone of your instrument and perfect your technique. Not sure which amp is right for you? Get some help and find out how to choose your ideal bass modeling amp.\n\n\u2022 Digital tuner - Making sure your bass stays in tune can help you develop your ear. As you increase your skill level, you may want to experiment with alternate bass tunings. A digital tuner can help you find the right pitch.\n\nHow To Tune A Bass Guitar\n\nWhile it may have a thicker, more bottom heavy sound than its six-stringed cousin, the guitar; the bass has the same first four strings, tuned to the same notes. The strings on the bass guitar are:\n\nE = The fourth (lowest tone) string\n\nA = The third string\n\nD = The second string\n\nG = The first (and highest tone) string\n\nThere are a number of ways to tune your bass. While you can tune it by ear or using harmonics -- playing a specific fret on an adjoining string and matching the tone of a higher, open string to it, the Fender Tune app makes it easy to stay in tune. Download the free bass tuning app to keep your playing pitch perfect.\n\n\u201cMusic is like the genius of humankind, universal\u2026 People who have never really taken the time to get into music, their lives are a lot smaller.\u201d\n\n- Flea, Red Hot Chili Peppers\n\nBass Finger Techniques For Beginners\n\nIt\u2019s been the subject of The Great Bass Debate for years: whether to play with a pick or your fingers. The truth is, there\u2019s no wrong way to play bass. Depending on the genre and style you like most, as well as your own finger strength and dexterity. Both styles have their own merits:\n\n\u2022 Play bass with a pick: If speed and versatility is what you strive for, playing bass with a pick may be your preferred method. Not only can you more quickly plunk out notes with a pick than you could with your fingers (barring years of practice and honing your technique), but experimenting with picks of different thickness can help you tweak your tone and give you a different sound.\n\n\u2022 Play bass with your fingers: Sometimes referred to as fingerstyle, playing bass with your fingers yields a smoother sound and allows you to slap and pop your strings for a funk-fueled tone. Most bassists who play with their fingers find it\u2019s easiest to start by using their index and middle fingers to pluck at the strings. However, with time, you can build up your dexterity and experiment with using your thumb to slap at the strings for an organic tone.\n\nHow To Play Bass Chords\n\nWhen learning to play bass, you may not encounter chords as frequently as you would when playing guitar. However, learning how to play bass chords can only serve to enhance your playing. While basslines are often the cornerstone of a song, bass chords help to add color, flavor, and a bottom-heavy rhythm to a song.\n\nA chord is a combination of three or more notes played together to produce a distinct sound. While chords are the foundation of a guitar education, it\u2019s possible to play chords on bass, as well. The strings on a bass correspond with the first four strings of a guitar. So, many guitar chords that make use of only the first four strings can be played on bass.\n\nHow To Play Bass Scales\n\nA bass scale is a consecutive series of notes played in an ascending or descending order. Every scale has 8 notes. This set of notes is called an octave. The notes on a scale remain the same, regardless of whether you\u2019re playing a scale on bass, guitar, or ukulele. Each scale begins and ends with the same note -- known as the \u201croot note.\u201d The final note of every scale is also the root note, but the pitch of the note is raised one octave higher than the first note.\n\nWhen playing bass scales, one of the easiest scales to start with is the G Major scale:\n\n1st Note (Root Note): G\n\n2nd Note: A\n\n3rd Note: B\n\n4th Note: C\n\n5th Note: D\n\n6th Note: E\n\n7th Note: F#\n\n8th Note (Root note, one octave higher): G\n\nThe G Major scale can be played on just one string of your bass, or span the full four strings. For instance, check out how to play the G Major on bass.\n\nLearning to play the popular C Major scale on bass can help you play a number of songs. Playing scales not only helps to build finger dexterity, but helps you to recognize the same notes and tones, even when played on different frets. Learning scales can also help you recognize patterns and apply them when playing songs or writing your own music and basslines.\n\nWant to learn and practice more bass scales? Here are some of the most popular bass scales:\n\nA free trial of Fender Play unlocks a world of new scales, skills and more, helping you level up your skill as a musician.\n\n\u201cThat is what intrigues me; songwriting and song structure and expression.\u201d\n\n- Geddy Lee, Rush\n\nHow to Create a Bassline\n\nA bassline is a series of notes played on bass that ties together chord tones, the key a song is written and performed in, and the rhythm -- anchoring the beat and melody of the song. Listen to funky, upbeat intro to Rick James\u2019 \u201cSuper Freak\u201d or the dark, murky opening bass notes of \u201cCome As You Are\u201d by Nirvana and hear those notes repeated throughout and you\u2019ll have a prime example of the power of a well-crafted bassline.\n\nBuilding a bassline weaves together some of the skills you\u2019ll pick up along your musical journey, transforming that knowledge into the joy of creation. Some tips to keep in mind when building bassline include:\n\n\u2022 Find a key: Start by knowing the key of the song. Learning your scales and listening for the root note that crops up in the song and its chords can help you narrow down the key of a song. This can help you to craft a bassline that compliments the song.\n\n\u2022 Pick apart chords: Listen to the chords a guitarist is playing and break them down, note by note, into an arpeggio. This can help you create a bassline that gels with the chords in a given song.\n\n\u2022 Listen for timing: Bass, at heart, is a rhythm instrument. It sets the tone and pace for a song. When crafting a bassline, keep in mind the tempo or signature of a song and use it to inform your bassline\u2019s rhythm.\n\nIn this Fender Play Live session, watch as host Dylan Caligiuri is joined by bassist Caleb Buchanan, giving you a crash course on what goes into building a memorable bassline.\n\nHow to Practice Bass for Beginners\n\nSetting good practice habits is essential for new bassists. For any beginner musician, making practice a regular part of your routine is critical to progress and building proficiency. Here are a few tips for carving out time to practice, as well as making sure you have what you need to get in a quality practice session.\n\n\u2022 Make time to practice. Practicing for even a few minutes a day is better than not practicing at all. The Fender Play app allows you to set practice reminders at a time that works for you. You set the date and time, we remind you when to practice. Similarly, the app tracks your progress and gamifies your practice session with Streaks. Whenever you practice in the Fender Play app for at least 7 minutes, 3 times per week, you earn points toward your streak.\n\n\u2022 Have a devoted practice space. Having a space dedicated to your practice can go a long way toward making it a regular part of your routine. If you can, find a place where you know you can practice uninterrupted. This space can include a stand or case for your bass and a comfortable seat that encourages good playing posture.\n\n\u2022 Start with scales and techniques. Start by learning fundamentals such as bass scales or by focusing on one technique at a time.\n\n\u2022 Be patient with yourself. No one picked up an instrument and learned it in one day. As you progress, you\u2019ll be able to link these smaller skills together and work your way up to playing entire songs or basslines.\n\nLearn a Song on Bass Guitar\n\nOne of the most rewarding parts of learning to play an instrument is putting that knowledge into practice by playing a song. Learning to play songs you love helps you develop a greater appreciation for the musicianship of the artists who created those tunes, as well as to develop your musical ear and experiment with new skills you learn.\n\nAn easy song for beginner bassists to learn is \u201cLa Grange\u201d by ZZ Top. The heavily-bearded trio\u2019s sound treads the line of blues and hard rock. The simple, yet driving bassline of the song gives new bassists a chance to hear the influence the blues has had on a variety of genres -- from rock to funk to country.\n\nWhat makes \u201cLa Grange\u201d such a great song for new bassists to play is that it offers up a very simple riff, playing just a few single notes -- with attention to tempo -- on a single string. There is a neat slide between a few frets on the A (second lowest) string on the song\u2019s bridge, but this one is all about rhythm and a steady tempo. It\u2019s also a great opportunity to experiment with playing bass with your fingers and how it affects the tone.\n\nLearn how to play La Grange on the bass here.\n\nExplore Bass Collections\n\nStill hungry for more songs to play on bass?
