After seeing the Lumi\u00e8re brothers \u2019 films in 1895, he became a filmmaker and made over 500 short films between 1896 and 1913. After the bankruptcy of his film company in 1913, M\u00e9li\u00e8s worked in obscurity in a toy store in a Paris train station. He and his films were rediscovered in the 1920s, and he was honoured for his role in film history.\n\nGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s\u2019s most famous film is Le Voyage dans la lune (1902; A Trip to the Moon). The film is a very loose adaptation of Jules Verne \u2019s novel De la terre \u00e0 la lune (1865; From the Earth to the Moon) and has the famous image of the spacecraft from Earth hitting the \u201cman in the moon\u201d in his eye.\n\nGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s is famous for his many innovations in motion pictures . He was one of the first to film fictional narratives, and he is regarded as the inventor of special effects in movies. His films were among the first to use such techniques as double exposure, stop-motion, and slow motion.\n\nGeorges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, (born December 8, 1861, Paris, France\u2014died January 21, 1938, Paris), early French experimenter with motion pictures, the first to film fictional narratives.\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese\u2019s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nBritannica Quiz Almost-Forgotten Artists Quiz\n\nWhen the first genuine movies, made by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers, were shown in Paris in 1895, M\u00e9li\u00e8s, a professional magician and manager-director of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Robert-Houdin, was among the spectators. The films were scenes from real life having the novelty of motion, but M\u00e9li\u00e8s saw at once their further possibilities. He acquired a camera, built a glass-enclosed studio near Paris, wrote scripts, designed ingenious sets, and used actors to film stories. With a magician\u2019s intuition, he discovered and exploited the basic camera tricks: stop motion, slow motion, dissolve, fade-out, superimposition, and double exposure.\n\nFrom 1899 to 1912 M\u00e9li\u00e8s made more than 400 films, the best of which combine illusion, comic burlesque, and pantomime to treat themes of fantasy in a playful and absurd fashion. He specialized in depicting extreme physical transformations of the human body (such as the dismemberment of heads and limbs) for comic effect. His films included pictures as diverse as Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1899; Cleopatra\u2019s Tomb), Le Christ marchant sur les eaux (1899; Christ Walking on Water), Le Voyage dans la lune (1902; A Trip to the Moon), Le Voyage \u00e0 travers l\u2019impossible (1904; The Voyage Across the Impossible), and Hamlet (1908). He also filmed studio reconstructions of news events as an early kind of newsreel. It never occurred to him to move the camera for close-ups or long shots. The commercial growth of the industry forced him out of business in 1913, and he died in poverty."}, {"url": "http://www.laokaoya.com/23571.html", "page_content": "\u5251\u6865\u96c5\u601d6Test3\u9605\u8bfbPassage1\u539f\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1 \u7535\u5f71\u7684\u8bde\u751f\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\n\n\u5251\u6865\u96c5\u601d6\u9605\u8bfb\u7b2c\u4e09\u5957\u9898\u76ee\u7b2c\u4e00\u7bc7\u6587\u7ae0\u7684\u4e3b\u9898\u4e3a\u7535\u5f71\u7684\u8bde\u751f\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u5206\u4e3a10\u6bb5\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u63cf\u8ff0\u7535\u5f71\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7535\u5f71\u5bf9\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u540e\u8f88\u3001\u7535\u5f71\u660e\u661f\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u751f\u6d3b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u5177\u4f53\u6bcf\u4e00\u6bb5\u7684\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3002\n\n\u70b9\u51fb\u67e5\u770b\u8fd9\u7bc7\u96c5\u601d\u9605\u8bfb\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u5bb6\u638c\u63e1\u7684\u91cd\u70b9\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u9898\u76ee\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u89e3\u6790\uff1a\n\n\u96c5\u601d\u771f\u9898\u9605\u8bfb\u8bcd\u6c47 \u5251\u6865\u96c5\u601d6 test 3 passage 1 \u7535\u5f71\u7684\u8bde\u751f\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\n\n\u5251\u6865\u96c5\u601d6Test3\u9605\u8bfbPassage1\u7b54\u6848\u89e3\u6790 \u7535\u5f71\u7684\u8bde\u751f\u4e0e\u5f71\u54cd\n\n\u5251\u6865\u96c5\u601d6 Test 3 Passage 1\u9605\u8bfb\u539f\u6587\u7ffb\u8bd1\n\n\u81ea\u7136\u6bb5A\n\nThe Lumi\u00e8re Brothers opened their Cinematographe, at 14 Boulevard des Capucines in Paris, to 100 paying customers over 100 years ago, on December 8, 1895.

A train appears and heads straight for the camera. And that is all that happens. Yet the Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, one of the greatest of all film artists, described the film as a \u2018work of genius\u2019. \u2018As the train approached,\u2019 wrote Tarkovsky, \u2018panic started in the theatre: people jumped and ran away. That was the moment when cinema was born. The frightened audience could not accept that they were watching a mere picture. Pictures were still, only reality moved; this must, therefore, be reality.

In time, the idea of film became familiar, the magic was accepted -but it never stopped being magic. Film has never lost its unique power to embrace its audiences and transport them to a different world. For Tarkovsky, the key to that magic was the way in which cinema created a dynamic image of the real flow of events. A still picture could only imply the existence of time, while time in a novel passed at the whim of the reader.

The star as magnified human self is one of cinema\u2019s most strange and enduring legacies.\n\n\u201c\u660e\u661f\u201d\u662f\u7535\u5f71\u9662\u7684\u53e6\u4e00\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u7269\u3002\u7535\u5f71\u660e\u661f\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f1910\u5e74\u8bde\u751f\u7684\u3002\u7535\u5f71\u4eba\u7269\u5177\u6709\u5982\u6b64\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4ee5\u81f3\u4e8e\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u53d8\u5f97\u8d85\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u5bc6\u5207\u5173\u6ce8\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e16\u754c\u4e0a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u4f3c\u4e4e\u90fd\u77e5\u9053\u4ed6\u4eec\u662f\u8c01\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6211\u4eec\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u6bd4\u6211\u4eec\u81ea\u5df1\u66f4\u52a0\u771f\u5b9e\u3002\u660e\u661f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u662f\u7535\u5f71\u6700\u5947\u602a\uff0c\u6700\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u9057\u4ea7\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\n\n\u81ea\u7136\u6bb5H\n\nCinema has also given a new lease of life to the idea of the story. When the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers and other pioneers began showing off this new invention, it was by no means obvious how it would be used. All that mattered at first was the wonder of movement. Indeed, some said that, once this novelty had worn off, cinema would fade away.

Or it might have developed like television \u2013 as a strange, noisy transfer of music, information and narrative. But what happened was that it became, overwhelmingly, a medium for telling stories. Originally these were conceived as short stories \u2013 early producers doubted the ability of audiences to concentrate for more than the length of a reel. Then, in 1912, an Italian 2-hour film was hugely successful, and Hollywood settled upon the novel-length narrative that remains the dominant cinematic convention of today.\n\n\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u7535\u5f71\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u53d8\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u8bb0\u5f55\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u6216\u8005\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u50cf\u7535\u89c6\u4e00\u6837\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u97f3\u4e50\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5947\u602a\u800c\u53c8\u5608\u6742\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u6210\u4e3a\u538b\u5012\u4e00\u5207\u7684\u8bb2\u6545\u4e8b\u7684\u5a92\u4ecb\u3002\u6700\u521d\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u77ed\u7bc7\u6545\u4e8b-\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u5236\u7247\u4eba\u6000\u7591\u89c2\u4f17\u96c6\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u5377\u80f6\u7247\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u57281912\u5e74\uff0c\u4e00\u90e8\u4e24\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u610f\u5927\u5229\u7535\u5f71\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6210\u529f\u3002\u597d\u83b1\u575e\u51b3\u5b9a\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u5b83\u81f3\u4eca\u4ecd\u662f\u5f53\u4eca\u7535\u5f71\u754c\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u3002\n\n\u81ea\u7136\u6bb5J\n\nAnd it has all happened so quickly.

Newton\u2019s Superboy was wise beyond his years, and had a tougher approach and lower tolerance for nonsense than we\u2019ve come to expect from most screen Supermen, while his Clark Kent was more alienated outsider than mild-mannered klutz\u2026a portrayal that predated Smallville by over a decade.\n\nThe Superboy TV show isn\u2019t for everyone, mostly because of occasionally subpar production values, bizarre scripts (especially in the first season), and some questionable performances. Newton did his best to bring something new to the role, though, but the first season of Superboy is mostly for the completists out there.\n\nGerard Christopher\n\nThe Adventures of Superboy (1989-1991)\n\nOften overlooked (like his predecessor), Gerard Christopher put in more hours as the Man of Steel (or Boy of Steel, in this case) than most of the other actors on this list.

Mr. Christopher (much like Mr. Reeve) looked like a Superman comic come to life, and wore the most comic book accurate version of the Superman costume ever seen on screen.\n\nBy the time the show reached its third and fourth seasons (which is currently streaming on the DC Universe service), it was a Superman show in all but name, right down to Clark and Lana (not Lois) working in a very newspaper-like environment. Gerard fought a series of equally comic book accurate supervillains throughout the show\u2019s run and played Clark Kent as the traditionally clumsy also-ran. At one point, he was even considered as Christopher Reeve\u2019s replacement for a rebooted Superman film franchise in the early \u201990s, and he auditioned for (and won!) the role for the Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman TV show before the showrunners learned he had already worn the cape."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Babe-Ruth", "page_content": "Babe Ruth , byname of George Herman Ruth, Jr. , also called the Bambino and the Sultan of Swat , (born February 6, 1895, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.\u2014died August 16, 1948, New York , New York), American professional baseball player. Largely because of his home-run hitting between 1919 and 1935, Ruth became, and perhaps remains to this day, America\u2019s most celebrated athlete.\n\nBaseball offered Ruth an opportunity to escape both poverty and obscurity. While a teenager at St. Mary\u2019s, he achieved local renown for his baseball-playing prowess, and in 1914 Jack Dunn, owner of the local minor-league Baltimore Orioles franchise, signed him to a contract for $600. Ruth obtained the nickname \u201cBabe\u201d when a sportswriter referred to him as one of \u201cDunn\u2019s babes.\u201d For his day, Ruth was a large man; he stood more than six feet tall and weighed more than 200 pounds. Before the end of the 1914 season, his performance as a pitcher was so impressive that Dunn sold Ruth to the American League Boston Red Sox . That same year Ruth met, courted, and wed waitress Helen Woodford.\n\nPart of the aura surrounding Ruth arose from his modest origins. Though the legend that he was an orphan is untrue, Ruth did have a difficult childhood. Both his parents, George Herman Ruth, Sr., and Kate Shamberger Ruth, came from working-class, ethnic (German) families. Ruth, Sr., owned and operated a saloon in a tough neighbourhood on the Baltimore waterfront. Living in rooms above the saloon, the Ruths had eight children, but only George, Jr., the firstborn, and a younger sister survived to adulthood. Since neither his busy father nor his sickly mother had much time for the youngster, George roamed the streets, engaged in petty thievery, chewed tobacco, sometimes got drunk, repeatedly skipped school, and had several run-ins with the law. In 1902 his parents sent him to the St. Mary\u2019s Industrial School for Boys, a Baltimore , Maryland , asylum for incorrigibles and orphans run by the Xaverian Brothers order of the Roman Catholic Church . For the next 10 years Ruth was in and out of St. Mary\u2019s. When his mother died from tuberculosis in 1912, he became a permanent ward of the school.\n\nAt the same time, Ruth exhibited so much hitting clout that, on the days he did not pitch, manager Ed Barrow played him at first base or in the outfield. In an age when home runs were rare, Ruth slammed out 29 in 1919, thereby topping the single-season record of 27 set in 1884 (by Ned Williamson of the Chicago White Stockings ). In 1920 Harry Frazee, the team owner and a producer of Broadway plays who was always short of money, sold Ruth to the New York Yankees for $125,000 plus a personal loan from Yankee owner Jacob Ruppert. While initially reluctant to leave Boston, Ruth signed a two-year contract with the Yankees for $10,000 a year.\n\nRuth soon became the best left-handed pitcher in baseball. Between 1915 and 1919 he won 87 games, yielded a stunning earned run average of only 2.16, won three World Series games (one in 1916 and two in 1918), and, during a streak for scoreless World Series innings, set a record by pitching 292/3 consecutive shutout innings.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nAs a full-time outfielder with the Yankees, Ruth quickly emerged as the greatest hitter to have ever played the game. Nicknamed by sportswriters the \u201cSultan of Swat,\u201d in his first season with the Yankees in 1920, he shattered his own single-season record by hitting 54 home runs, 25 more than he had hit in 1919. The next season Ruth did even better: he slammed out 59 homers and drove in 170 runs. In 1922 his salary jumped to $52,000, making him by far the highest-paid player in baseball. That summer he and Helen appeared in public with a new daughter, Dorothy, who was apparently the result of one of his many sexual escapades.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He continued with a strong season in 1924 when he hit a league-leading 46 home runs, but in 1925, while suffering from an intestinal disorder (thought by many to be syphilis), his offensive production declined sharply. That season, while playing in only 98 games, he hit 25 home runs.\n\nHe also struggled in his private life. Two years earlier he had met and fallen in love with actress Claire Hodgson, and in 1925 he legally separated from Helen. Helen\u2019s death from a fire in 1929 freed him to marry Hodgson the same year. The couple then formally adopted Dorothy, and Ruth adopted Hodgson\u2019s daughter, Julia.\n\nOn the field during the 1926 season, Ruth returned to his old form. Indeed, in the 1926\u201332 seasons Ruth in his offensive output towered over all other players in the game. For those seven seasons he averaged 49 home runs per season, batted in 151 runs, and had a batting average of .353 while taking the Yankees to four league pennants and three World Series championships. In 1927 Ruth\u2019s salary leapt to $70,000. That season he hit 60 home runs, a record that remained unbroken until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961 (see also Researcher\u2019s Note: Baseball\u2019s problematic single-season home run record). That same season Ruth teamed with Lou Gehrig to form the greatest home-run hitting duo in baseball. Ruth and Gehrig were the heart of the 1927 Yankees team\u2014nicknamed Murderer\u2019s Row\u2014which is regarded by many baseball experts as the greatest team to ever play the game.\n\nThe 1932 World Series revealed not only Ruth\u2019s flair for exploiting the moment but produced his famous \u201ccalled shot\u201d home run. In the third game of the series against Chicago, while being heckled by the Cubs bench, Ruth, according to a story whose accuracy remains in doubt to this day, responded by pointing his finger to the centre-field bleachers. On the very next pitch, Ruth hit the ball precisely into that spot. After 1932 Ruth\u2019s playing skills rapidly diminished. Increasingly corpulent and slowed by age, his offensive numbers dropped sharply in both 1933 and 1934. He wanted to manage the Yankees, but Ruppert, the team\u2019s owner, is reported to have said that Ruth could not control his own behaviour, let alone that of the other players, and so refused to offer him the post. Hoping eventually to become a manager, in 1935 Ruth joined the Boston Braves as a player and assistant manager. But the offer to manage a big-league team never came. Ruth finished his career that season with 714 home runs, a record that remained unblemished until broken by Henry Aaron in 1974."}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/athletes/babe-ruth", "page_content": "(1895-1948)\n\nWho Was Babe Ruth?\n\nOver the course of his career, Babe Ruth went on to break baseball's most important slugging records, including most years leading a league in home runs, most total bases in a season, and highest slugging percentage for a season. In all, Ruth hit 714 home runs\u2014a mark that stood until 1974.\n\nEarly Life\n\nRuth was born George Herman Ruth Jr. on February 6, 1895, in Baltimore, Maryland. Ruth was raised in a poor waterfront neighborhood in Baltimore, where his parents, Kate Schamberger-Ruth and George Herman Ruth Sr., owned a tavern. Ruth was one of eight children born to the couple, and one of only two that survived infancy.\n\nAt the age of 7, the trouble-making Ruth became too much of a handful for his busy parents. Routinely caught wandering the dockyards, drinking, chewing tobacco and taunting local police officers, his parents finally decided he needed more discipline than they could give him. Ruth's family sent him to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a Catholic orphanage and reformatory that became Ruth's home for the next 12 years. Ruth particularly looked up to a monk named Brother Matthias, who became a father figure to the young boy.\n\nEarly Career\n\nMathias, along with several other monks of the order, introduced Ruth to baseball, a game at which the boy excelled. By the time he was 15, Ruth showed exceptional skill both as a strong hitter and pitcher. It was his pitching that initially caught the attention of Jack Dunn, the owner of the minor league Baltimore Orioles. At the time, the Orioles groomed players for the major league team known as the Boston Red Sox, and Dunn saw promise in Ruth's athletic performance.\n\nOnly 19, the law at the time stated that Ruth had to have a legal guardian sign his baseball contract in order for him to play professionally. As a result, Dunn became Ruth's legal guardian, leading teammates to jokingly call Ruth \"Dunn's new babe.\" The joke stuck, and Ruth quickly earned the nickname \"Babe\" Ruth.\n\nRuth was only with the club for a short time before he was called up to the majors in Boston. The left-handed pitcher proved immediately to be a valuable member of the team. Over the next five years, Ruth led the Red Sox to three championships, including the 1916 title which saw him pitch a still-record 13 scoreless innings in one game.\n\nMajor Leagues\n\nWith its titles and \"the Babe,\" Boston was clearly the class act of the major leagues. All that would change in 1919, however, with a single stroke of a pen. Faced with financial hardships, Red Sox owner Harry Frazee needed cash to pay off his debts. He found help in the New York Yankees, which agreed in December 1919 to buy the rights to Ruth for the then-impressive sum of $100,000.\n\nThe deal came to shape both franchises in unforeseen ways. For Boston, Ruth's departure spelled the end of the team's winning streak. The club wouldn't win another World Series until 2004, a championship drought that later sports writers dubbed \"The Curse of the Bambino.\"\n\nFor the New York Yankees, it was a different matter. With Ruth leading the way, New York turned into a dominant force, winning four World Series titles over the next 15 seasons. Ruth, who became a full-time outfielder, was at the heart of all the success, unleashing a level of power that had never been seen before in the game.\n\nRecord-Breaking Career and Stats\n\nIn 1919, while with the Red Sox, Ruth set a single-season home run record of 29. This turned out to be just the beginning of a series of record-breaking performances by Ruth. In 1920, his first year in New York, he knocked 54 home runs. In his second season he broke his own record by hitting 59 home runs and, in less than 10 seasons, Ruth had made his mark as baseball's all-time home run leader.\n\nYet the athlete seemed determined to continue breaking his own records. In 1927, he outdid himself again by hitting 60 home runs in a season's time\u2014a record that stood for 34 years. By this time, his presence was so great in New York that the new Yankee Stadium (built in 1923) was dubbed \"the house that Ruth built.\"\n\nOver the course of his career, Ruth went on to break baseball's most important slugging records, including most years leading a league in home runs (12); most total bases in a season (457); and highest slugging percentage for a season (.847). In all he hit 714 home runs, a mark that stood until 1974, when Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves surpassed him.\n\nRetirement and Legacy\n\nRuth's success on the field was matched by a lifestyle that catered perfectly to a pre-Depression America hungry for a fast lifestyle. Rumors of his large appetite for food, alcohol, and women, as well as his tendency toward extravagant spending and high living, were as legendary as his exploits at the plate. This reputation, whether true or imagined, hurt Ruth's chances of becoming a team manager in later life. Ball clubs, wary of his lifestyle, didn't want to take a chance on the seemingly irresponsible Ruth. In 1935 he was lured back to Boston to play for the Braves and for the opportunity, so he thought, to manage the club the following season. The job never materialized.\n\nOn May 25, 1935, an overweight and greatly diminished Ruth reminded fans of his greatness one last time when hit three home runs in a single game at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The following week, Ruth officially retired. He was one of the first five players inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936.\n\nWhile he eventually earned the title of coach for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1938, Ruth never achieved his goal of managing a major league team. Known throughout his life as a generous man, he gave much of his time in his last years to charitable events instead. On June 13, 1948, he made one last appearance at Yankee Stadium to celebrate the building's 25th anniversary.

Milton is the last name of the author of one of Steinbeck's favorite works, Paradise Lost. In that epic poem, Adam and Eve fall from grace in the Garden of Eden. Because of their fall, mankind is doomed to be alone and walk the earth as a lonely being. Some critics believe George represents that doomed man who longs to return to Eden. His one chance to avoid that fate is his relationship with Lennie, which makes them different from the other lonely men. But despite this companionship, at the end of the book, George is fated to be once again alone.\n\nGeorge's personality often reflects both anger and understanding. Of the two men, he is the one who thinks things through and considers how their goals can be reached. Once Candy makes the stake possible, George comes up with the details: where they will get the ranch, how long they must work to pay for it, and how they will have to keep a low profile in order to work for the next month. George also foresees possible complications and gives Lennie advice about what he must do in order to help their future. While George can be very rational and thoughtful, he also gets frustrated and angry with Lennie because the big man cannot control his strength or actions. George repeatedly gets angry, so much so that Lennie knows by heart what it means when George \"gives him hell.\" But George's anger quickly fades when he remembers Lennie's innocence and his inability to remember or think clearly.\n\nGeorge, unlike other men, has a companion and friend in Lennie. Because of this, Lennie makes George feel special. They are different from all the other guys, and George realizes only too well that they have a special bond. At the ranch, George often plays solitaire, a game for one. Without Lennie, George would be a loner. Even though George gets frustrated by Lennie's mental weakness, he also feels compassion for his friend. Lennie offers George the opportunity to lay plans, give advice, and, in general, be in charge. Without Lennie, George would be just like the other hands, but with Lennie, George has a strong sense of responsibility. In the end, he even takes responsibility for Lennie's death. George also understands that Lennie does not have an adult's sense of guilt and does not understand death or murder beyond it being a \"bad thing.\" George makes it possible for Lennie \u2014 sometimes \u2014 to understand at least partial consequences of his actions. Unfortunately, George does not realize how dangerous Lennie can be, and this lack of foresight adds to the downfall of their dream.\n\nTheir dream also sets George apart from the others because it means he and Lennie have a future and something to anticipate. Unlike Lennie, George does not see their dream in terms of rabbits; instead, he sees it in a practical way. Their farm will be one where they can be independent and safe and where he will not have to worry about keeping track of Lennie's mistakes. They can be secure and in charge of their own lives. However, Lennie is the one who adds the enthusiasm because George never really believed they could swing this farm of their own. He mostly uses the story to give Lennie something to believe in for their future. Only when Candy offers the stake does George actually begin to see that this dream could come true. But, realist that he is, George tells Candy over the lifeless body of Curley's wife, \"I think I knowed from the very first. I think I know'd we'd never do her. He usta like to hear about it so much I got to thinking maybe we would [be able to have the farm.]\" In the end, George Milton is man alone once again."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/educational-magazines/his-having-arrived-age-twenty-three", "page_content": "On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\n\nJohn Milton\n\nc. 1632\n\n\"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three,\" which exists in manuscript and was printed twice during Milton's lifetime (in the Poems of 1645 and 1673), was most likely written in 1632 at a crucial time in Milton's life, just after his graduation from Cambridge. Milton here acknowledges that he may not seem as mature as some of his contemporaries but expresses a desire to use his talents well and his trust in God's will for him over time. One thing to understand about Milton's sonnets is their topical range. Not a writer of love sonnets in English (although the sonnets he wrote in Italian are love sonnets), Milton writes political sonnets, occasional sonnets, elegiac sonnets, and sonnets of personal meditation, like this one.\n\nAuthor Biography\n\nMilton was born in Cheapside, London, in 1608, the son of John Milton, Sr., a prosperous scrivener, notary, and composer, and Sara Jeffrey Milton. Because of the family's financial standing, Milton received an excellent education in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, and Italian. Music and literature were particular favorites with the boy, and Milton began composing his own poetry at a young age. From 1618 to 1620, he was privately tutored at the family home. He then attended St. Paul's School before moving on to Christ's College, Cambridge, at the age of sixteen. At first unpopular, Milton eventually made a name for himself as a rhetorician and public speaker. Upon leaving the university in 1632 with a master's degree, Milton retired to Hammersmith for three years and later to Horton, Buckinghamshire, where he devoted himself to intense study and writing. In May of 1638, Milton embarked on an Italian journey that was to last nearly fifteen months. The experience, which he described in Pro populo anglicano defensio secunda (Second Defence of the People of England,1654), brought him into contact with the leading men of letters in Florence, Rome, and Naples, including Giovanni Battista Manso, Marquis of Villa, who had been an intimate of the epic poet Torquato Tasso. Scholars view the Italian tour as seminal in Milton's literary development; a new self-confidence emerged in the letters he wrote during his travels, and it was in Italy that Milton first proposed to write a great epic.\n\nWith the coming of the English Civil War and the Commonwealth, Milton's life changed completely as his attentions shifted from private to public concerns. Abruptly, Milton left off writing poetry for prose, pouring out pamphlets during the early 1640s in which he opposed what he considered rampant Episcopal tyranny. Milton declared his Puritan allegiance in tracts in which he argued the need to purge the Church of England of all vestiges of Roman Catholicism and restore the simplicity of the apostolic church. In 1642, he married his first wife, Mary Powell, who left him shortly after the wedding (but returned to him three years later; paradoxically, though Milton was to marry two more times, he was never divorced). With the execution of Charles I in 1649, Milton entered the political fray with The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates, an assertion of the right of a people to depose or execute a ruling tyrant. This view constituted a complete about-face for Milton, who had written as a good monarchist in his early works. Henceforth, Milton was permanently on the political left. He accepted an invitation to become Cromwell's Latin secretary for foreign affairs and issued a number of tracts on church and state issues. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660 left Milton disillusioned and hastened his departure from public life; as a former member of the Commonwealth, he lived for a time in peril, but for reasons not entirely clear, he was spared harsh punishment.\n\nThe remaining fourteen years of Milton's life were spent in relatively peaceful retirement in and around London. Completely blind since 1652, he increasingly devoted his time to poetry. Amanuenses, assisted sometimes by Milton's two nephews\n\nand his daughter Deborah, were employed to take dictation, correct copy, and read aloud, and Milton made rapid progress on projects he had put off many years before. During the writing of Paradise Lost, Milton spent mornings dictating passages he had composed in his head at night. Paradise Lost was published in 1667, followed in 1671 by Paradise Regained. \"Samson Agonistes,\" a verse tragedy, appeared in the same volume as Paradise Regained. He died in November 1674, apparently of complications arising from gout.\n\nPoem Text\n\nHow soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,\n\nStol'n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year!\n\nMy hasting days fly on with full career,\n\nBut my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.\n\nPerhaps my semblance might deceive the truth 5\n\nThat I to manhood am arrived so near;\n\nAnd inward ripeness doth much less appear,\n\nThat some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.\n\nYet be it less or more, or soon or slow,\n\nIt shall be still in strictest measure even 10\n\nTo that same lot, however mean or high,\n\nToward which Time leads me, and the will of\n\nHeaven;\n\n\n\nAll is, if I have grace to use it so,\n\nAs ever in my great Task-Master's eye.\n\nPoem Summary\n\nLines 1\u20132\n\nThese lines introduce the poem's theme and create a metaphor of Time as a bird flying away with (\"stol'n on his wing\") Milton's youth.\n\nLine 3\n\nHere, the poet expresses his sense of how quickly time passes: \"hasting days\" and \"full career.\"\n\nLine 4\n\nThe poet here uses a seasonal metaphor to express that his time of life is a \"late spring\" but that so far, it has not shown any \"bud or blossom,\" in other words any promise of fruit or achievements in his life.\n\nLines 5\u20136\n\nThe poet remarks that he does not seem as old as he is (his look \"deceive[s]\" the truth that he is practically a man).\n\nLines 7\u20138\n\n\"Inward ripeness\" continues the natural metaphor of \"bud\" and \"blossom\" in line 4; the poet has more maturity or ripeness inside than he shows outside, and more than some other young people, the \"more timely-happy spirits\" have. But, note the various possibilities in the word \"endur'th.\" The lines are grammatically inverted and could be paraphrased, \"and inward ripeness, that imbues / clothes some others, appears less in me.\" The phrase \"timely-happy spirits\" can be understood to refer to those who are more comfortable with their age or whose age reflects more happily their inner being.\n\nLines 9\u201312\n\n\"It\" may refer to the appearance of inward ripeness of line 7; whether ripeness appears less or more, now or later, it shall be just right according to his destiny, the \"lot \u2026 / Toward which Time leads\" him. Where the octave found dissonance between his inner and outward states of maturity, the sestet's answer is that time and the will of heaven will even things out according to plan. Note the multiple puns in this line: \"measure\" could mean a musical measure or a line of verse; \"even\" may be an adjective modifying \"measure\" or may lead the reader into the next line, \"even to that same lot.\" Milton often places adjectives both before and after nouns, and he likewise often lets the word at the end of a line work in two different ways in each line.\n\nLines 13\u201314\n\nCritics have differed as to the precise interpretation of these lines, but, in general, they suggest that whatever the outcome of the speaker's life, it will be with God's knowledge and in accordance with His world. The \"great Task-Master\" is God.\n\nThemes\n\nCrisis of Faith\n\nThe crisis created by Milton's awareness of the passage of time is one that can be resolved by the poet's choice to put his future in God's hands. In the first eight lines of the poem, Milton worries that time has passed too quickly. He has been at Cambridge studying, but has had little time to fulfill what he sees as his destiny. Milton is aware he is a talented poet, but instead of writing poetry, he has been studying. This precipitates a crisis of faith for the poet, who worries he has wasted precious time. But maybe the poet's talent, which \"be it less or more,\" will be less when he is mature. He worries, although he is still confident of his future. In the final six lines of the sonnet, Milton acknowledges that time, whether \"soon or slow,\" will still inevitably lead him to God. This is the same future that all men will face, \"however mean or high.\" Time will lead Milton to God, if he can accept the limitations of earthly time. In these final lines, Milton finds the answer to his problem in giving control over his life to God and, as a result, his crisis of faith is resolved.\n\nJourney\n\nMilton uses this sonnet to symbolize the poet's journey from doubt to self-discovery. He feels guilty about his time spent studying when he has not published anything. He is slow to mature, and by \"late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.\" But, in line 9, the pronoun \"it,\" whose antecedent is unclear, but which is usually thought to refer to the poet's maturity, might suggest that the poet's talents will ripen with maturity, that rather than having wasted his youth, the poet has been marking time until he is mature enough to create the kind of poetry he feels destined to create. As he nears age twenty-four, the poet feels he is at the border between youth and manhood, a time to which he has \"arrived so near.\" He worries that when he reaches maturity his talent may be less, rather than more. Although worried, he is confident in his own abilities, and so the sonnet moves the poet from the hesitance and questioning of youth to the realization that perhaps he will achieve all he wishes. The sestet is filled with obscure references: it, more, less, soon, slow. There are contradictions and uncertainties, all of which indicate that the journey will not always be clear. Ultimately, the poet feels the journey will bring him success. His intent is to please God and use his abilities as best he can. The journey is to reaffirm the poet's faith in God and to find his place in the world.\n\nPassage of Time\n\nMilton's sonnet explores the idea of time as a guide to his destiny. Milton calls time \"the subtle thief of youth\" because time steals without awareness. This sonnet is written sometime after Milton's twenty-third birthday, and already the poet is thinking about the approach of his twenty-fourth birthday. He sees the ways in which time steals the days away from him, and he is not even aware of each day passing. The poet notes how he has planned to accomplish so many things, yet instead feels he has spent too much time studying and learning. What he considers the promise of his youth has come to no fruition, \"no bud or blossom shew'th.\" In lines 5 through 8, the poet suggests that time can deceive others, since he still appears to be young; but Milton knows the truth, that time has stolen his youth. In the final six lines of the poem, Milton changes direction and the sestet responds to the problem expressed in the octave: time which steals his youth is also bringing him closer to God. This religious interpretation of time expresses the Renaissance notion that the passage of time will bring mankind closer to a final meeting with God. Milton justifies his use of time because, regardless of how he spends it, in the end time is on his side, bringing him closer to his God.\n\nTopics for Further Study\n\nMilton's poem is really a journey from questioning to knowledge. Write an essay that explores a personal journey you have made from questioning a choice to the acknowledgement of understanding that your choice was a correct one for you.\n\nWilliam Blake used art to interpret many of Milton's poems. Use whatever artistic format that fits your talents to create an artistic interpretation of this poem on the passing of time.\n\nMilton uses his poem to explore what he thinks is his destiny. Write a poem that explores your future.\n\nReligion was an important part of early seventeenth-century English life. The idea of God's plan for mankind was especially important. Research the early seventeenth century and write an essay discussing the role of religious thought in how men and women in this period planned their futures.\n\nResearch the education system in place for both males and females in seventeenth-century England. What kinds of careers could boys plan to pursue? Compare these to the options available for girls.\n\nPredestination and Free Will\n\nThis poem makes clear that Milton is incorporating both Calvinist ideas of predestination and the Anglican Church's emphasis on free will into his poem. The poem's octave, the first eight lines, focuses on the problem of free will. Milton has chosen his course of study, and as a result he has neglected his own talents, his poetry. This time spent on academics has flourished and flown, as he acknowledges in line 3: \"My hasting days fly on.\" But now, as he readies himself to leave Cambridge, he must face the awareness of lost time. In the poem's sestet, Milton moves toward resolution, which he finds in embracing both the Calvinist idea of predestination and the Anglican promise of free will. He can reconcile his wasted youth if he gives the choice to God. His youth has not been wasted, since it moves him closer to God; this is \"the will of Heaven.\" At the same time, the next line, \"if I have grace to use it so,\" takes the poem back to free will. His talents will grow and develop if Milton chooses to do so. As a result of Milton's playing with this opposition, he creates a tension in his poem. Human effort and divine will are partners in Milton's future. The resolution to Milton's dilemma is in recognizing this fact.\n\nStyle\n\nIn its form, \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\" is an Italian sonnet (also known as a Petrarchan sonnet), written, like most sonnets, in iambic pentameter. Its thematic organization closely follows the structure of the form, with two well-developed movements corresponding to the eight-line octave and the six-line sestet. The octave follows the conventional Petrarchan rhyme scheme of abbaabba, while the sestet rhymes cdcdee, one of several conventional patterns. The octave breaks conventionally into two shorter movements, each consisting of a quatrain rhyming abba. The beginning of the sestet, where the rhyme scheme changes, is known as the turn of the sonnet because at this point an Italian sonnet's theme or tone usually shifts. In the case of \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\" the transitional \"But\" signals a change from the impatient arrogance of the octave into the humbler prayer of the sestet.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nSeventeenth Century\n\nThe years between 1576 and 1642 are often described as the golden age of English poetry, drama, and theatre, although the period was not golden for those who lived through it. For one hundred years, farmers had been displaced by enclosure acts that fenced off agricultural land for pastures, resulting in inflation and unemployment in the countryside. Crop failures, the threat of war abroad, and the sometimes brutal religious strife that enveloped the country, had shaken English society by the time Elizabeth assumed the throne in 1558. The Elizabethan regimen produced relative stability, but the queen's failure to name a successor brought discontent and the threat of civil war even before her death. Initially, James I's rule was greeted with enthusiasm, but religious, class, and political divisions intensified with time. Rural unemployment drove many people to London, making it the largest city in Europe. Civil problems led to widespread disorder, while the establishment of a capitalistic economy took the place of the feudal agrarian social order. Disorder and conflict led writers to grapple with new ideas about science, philosophy, religion, and politics. There was a new emphasis on individual thought, action, and responsibility. In spite of this turmoil, or perhaps because of it, the most important drama in Western history was produced.\n\nA Period of Change\n\nThe period in which John Milton was writing is one marked by enormous changes. After nearly fifty years as queen, Elizabeth I died in 1603. James IV of Scotland became the new English king, James I. While Elizabeth had encouraged a degree of individualism, James believed in absolute monarchy based on the divine right of kings. Although Elizabeth had reinstated the Protestant church, with herself as the official head of the Church of England, she was also more tolerant of religious choice than her predecessor Mary I had been. While the people still mistrusted and barely tolerated the Roman Catholic Church, which was associated with papal corruption and intolerance, Elizabeth managed to keep these religious issues subdued. With Elizabeth's death, the movement toward religious tolerance changed, and religion became a problem for public debate once again.\n\nOne issue was the marriage of James's son Charles, the new heir, to the French princess, a Roman Catholic. The debates about religion, however, involved more than just the opposition of Protestant and Catholic. The Anglicans, who argued for free will governing men's actions, opposed the Calvinists, who argued for predestination. There were debates about the use of prayer books and the designation of church officials. This controversy and debate heavily influenced the poetry of this period. Consider, for example, Milton's sonnet, \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three,\" which creates tension in the opposition between predestination and free will.\n\nPuritan Intolerance\n\nAnother religious group whose actions would have lasting impact were the Puritans. Both James and Charles encouraged Sunday festivals and sporting contests. The Puritans thought these activities were the work of the devil or, at the very least, an embracing of the pagan past. James and Charles were also big patrons of the theatre. Charles, in particular, supported huge theatrical productions called masques. These were often very elaborate and very expensive, a cost born by the public in the form of additional taxes. The Puritans opposed the burgeoning theatre and thought actors were sinful and displayed substandard morals. In part this view of the theatre was based on the social environment of the playhouse, which was libertine. Puritan opposition to theatre was based on a philosophical argument:\n\nCompare & Contrast\n\n1630s: An epidemic of the plague killed more than 40,000 people in London only a few years earlier, and it continues to kill thousands more in the years that follow. As a result, government and much of London social life is suspended during the peak months of plague each summer. The wealthy move to summer houses, while the poor, with no place to go, remain in London to battle the plague on their own. This escape of the wealthy from the plague further establishes the privileges of the wealthy and helps lead to revolution.\n\nToday: Society is not as clearly divided between the rich and poor as was the case during the seventeenth century, and the plague no longer decimates the population every year. However, in spite of some advances in equality now evident in England, English society is still somewhat stratified, with divisions based on social rank and income.\n\nAn epidemic of the plague killed more than 40,000 people in London only a few years earlier, and it continues to kill thousands more in the years that follow.

One of the newest discoveries is a published account by William Harvey, who posits that the heart is a muscle and it pushes blood throughout the body. Harvey cannot explain the creation of blood. While many of the new scientists endorse Harvey's viewpoints, others dispute this claim, believing instead that the liver is the organ of circulation. New scientific discoveries influence the poets of the period, who incorporate tension produced by scientific disovery into their poetry.\n\nToday: Harvey's hypothesis has long since been proven true, and today, both heart transplants and artificial hearts are common. One thing has not changed, however, and that is the skepticism that often greets new ideas in medicine. New ideas about medicine often undergo laborious tests to prove their validity. It is predominantly journalists and not poets, however, who discuss new scientific ideas.\n\nThe new interest in science is very important to Englishmen.

Because the wife of King Charles I has participated in performances at court, Prynne's attack is viewed as a slander on the queen, and he is thrown into prison after being branded and having his ears cut off. By 1642, the Puritans succeed in having all the theatres in London closed.\n\nToday: While film is often condemned for excessive violence and sexual content, theatres are rarely the object of protest.\n\nPuritan William Prynne attacks the London theatre as lewd and as a haven for prostitutes.

Galileo's ideas violate Church teachings that God created mankind, and so the earth, on which man resides, must be more important than all other planets and it must be the center of the universe. Because he is threatened with torture, Galileo eventually retracts his proposition and is confined to his villa for the rest of his life.\n\nToday: Galileo was eventually proven correct, and while it took the Church in Rome nearly 400 years to admit Galileo was right, eventually the Church cleared Galileo of heresy and retracted his excommunication.\n\nGalileo is tried in Rome for endorsing an earlier scientific theory that the sun is the center of the universe and the earth only a rotating planet.

When the House of Commons petitions King James I to prevent a Catholic marriage for his son Charles, James I rebukes the Commons for meddling in foreign affairs. The Commons responds that the marriage, religion, and birthright of a king is a suitable subject for the Commons to debate. Eventually, Charles is deposed and beheaded, and Milton serves as Secretary of Letters for Cromwell's government.\n\nToday: Rules governing marriage of the royal family are still an important topic in England. In the twentieth century, Edward VIII abdicated when he was not allowed to marry a divorced American woman, and heirs to the English throne are still not permitted to marry Roman Catholics. Because of a tumultuous past, with vicious attacks against both Catholics and Protestants, the English continue to govern the religious choices of the royal family.\n\nacting is lying, role-playing. Plays also brought large numbers of people together, thus increasing crime and disease, and they enticed people away from their jobs and so affected trade. As a result, city officials often sided with Puritans in wanting theatres closed or moved outside town. Eventually Puritan opposition led to revolution and the beheading of King Charles I. Milton later allied himself with the rebellion and Oliver Cromwell, and so religion emerged as an important focal point of Milton's life and of this period.\n\nCritical Overview\n\nMilton is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential English poets, ranking with Chaucer and Shakespeare. He wrote both poetry and prose, and in poetry wrote pastoral, elegy, epic, drama, sonnet, and other kinds of verse. His most famous and influential work is the epic Paradise Lost, which has been at the center of English literary criticism since Milton's day. His sonnets have received less critical attention. Lord Macaulay, in his essay \"Milton\" published in 1860, differed from most critics in that he valued the sonnets highly. He found that \"traces \u2026 of the peculiar character of Milton may be found in all of his works; but it is most strongly displayed in the Sonnets. Those remarkable poems have been undervalued.\" Macaulay links the sonnets firmly to Milton's life and character, a view that seems especially true of \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three.\"\n\n\"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\" is fairly straightforward until the last three lines. Many explications of this section have been attempted. K. Svendsen, in The Explicator, offers three interpretations, but prefers the following: \"All that matters is whether I have grace to use my ripeness in accordance with the will of God as one ever in his sight.\" D. C. Dorian, writing in another issue of The Explicator, differs, thinking that \"ever\" can mean \"eternity\" and paraphrases the section this way: \"All time is, if I have grace to use it so, as eternity in God's sight.\"\n\nAnother way to interpret these lines is with recourse to the manuscript, which has no punctuation. Instead of reading line 12 as if it had two subjects (toward which Time and the will of heaven lead me) one can read \"will of heaven\" as the subject of \"is\" (the will of heaven is all). In that case, line 14 could variously take as antecedent \"I\" (the will of heaven is all, if I, being watched by God as always, have grace to treat it as if it is all) or more loosely the using of his lot (the will of heaven is all, if I have grace to act as if that is so, remaining in God's sight). Other interpretations are of course possible; several are noted in A Variorum Commentary on the Poems of John Milton by A. S. P. Woodhouse and Douglas Bush.\n\nCriticism\n\nSheri E. Metzger\n\nMetzger has a doctorate in English Renaissance literature. She teaches literature and drama at the University of New Mexico, where she is a lecturer in the English department and an adjunct professor in the university's honors program. In this essay, Metzger discusses Milton's reworking of the sonnet format in his poem and explores the influences of earlier and contemporary English poets on Milton and the development of the sonnet format.\n\nIn England, the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were marked by a phenomenal outpouring of poetic talent. The poets of this era often took older established formulas and rewrote and revised the formulas to express new, often controversial, ideas about their world. These poems were not published until many years after their composition. Instead, the poems were copied and circulated among other poets. This circulation of poems led to a competitiveness between poets, with each successive poet \"playing\" with the formula and content to create a new kind of poem, one that he would then pass on to his friends. This was especially true of the poetic form known as the sonnet. For instance, in John Milton's sonnet \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three,\" the poet uses the sonnet format to explore the passing of time and to question if he is fulfilling God's plan or if he is wasting precious time in study that might be better devoted to writing. In using the sonnet form for such questioning, Milton is only the most recent of the Renaissance poets to appropriate and revise the traditional sonnet to serve a purpose that is very different from its traditional intent. In a sense, Milton's use of the sonnet serves as the culmination of a creative period that saw the use of the sonnet transformed from a simple vehicle to express a lover's lament to an elaborate and complex formula that could be used to express religious fervor, personal anguish, and the poet's fears about life.\n\nWhen Sir Thomas Wyatt introduced the Italian sonnet to England early in the sixteenth century, he was importing a well-defined poetic formula that illustrated certain carefully crafted ideas. The Italian sonnet probably developed in Italy in the thirteenth century but was adapted by Petrarch a century later to express a lover's lament. The formula is simple, and few poets deviated from either the Italian rhyme scheme or the Petrarchan content. The rhyme consists of fourteen lines, with the first eight lines forming an octave, abbaabba, that presents either a narrative or raises a question. The octave is followed by a sestet, efgefg, that either makes an abstract comment upon the narrative or offers a solution for the problem. The traditional devices included elaborate conceits and exaggerated comparisons that expressed a lover's beauty and charm and her cruelty to her lover. These sonnets always emphasized the suffering of the forlorn lover at the hands of his cruel mistress. Wyatt's \"The Long Love That in My Thought Doth Harbor\" (1540) is typical of this style. In this poem, love is compared to war, and the lover is cold and distant. In another Wyatt poem, \"Whoso List to Hunt\" (1540), the object of the hunt is a woman, thought to be Anne Boleyn, one of King Henry the VIII's wives. The woman is even more objectified than normal and is diminished in her role as prey. Of course, she is also unavailable and thus cold to his pleas, and so the poet is even more dejected and rejected than usual.\n\nInitially, these Italian sonnets were used to express an abject suitor's desire or love for a reluctant woman. Love was often painful and explored through elaborate conceits. A favorite comparison was love as a battle or war, or as illness or pain. But, it did not take very long for English Renaissance poets to deviate from this formula. For example, William Shakespeare avoids the traditional Italian pattern in Romeo and Juliet (1595). In act I, scene v, lines 90 to 103, Shakespeare's conceit involves saints and the kissing of palms as lips. Instead of the typical Petrarchan declaration of how hopeless his love and how cold his lover, Shakespeare uses logic and reason in his argument. This sonnet also provides for two speakers. Romeo speaks the first four lines, Juliet the next four, and then the two lovers alternate the next six lines. This deviation from typical sonnet style and content was not unusual for Shakespeare. Many of his sonnets deal with topics other than love and desire. He also explores issues such as time and death, in which he presents solutions such as immortalizing oneself in verse or in the creation of children to outwit death. Of course, Shakespeare also wrote of the pain of love in sonnets, but he addressed many of his sonnets to a young man, a departure from sixteenth century norms in which a woman was typically both the subject and the audience for a sonnet. By the end of the sixteenth century, a new English sonnet had been created to join the more familiar Italian format. The English sonnet contained three quatrains, abab cdcd efef, and ended with a couplet, gg, instead of the octave and sestet found in the Italian sonnet. However, the end of the sixteenth century does not mark the end of the modification of the sonnet. It took the efforts of several other poets to complete the transformation of the sonnet from a vehicle to express lament for a mistress to a complex piece of poetry capable of using rhyme to enhance a theme that has little to do with a woman's love.\n\nEarly in the seventeenth century, the sonnet was transfigured into a way to worship God, and a whole new wave of poets, including John Donne, George Herbert, and John Milton, took this new format in a completely different direction. Donne uses the sonnet format to question God or, more correctly, demand of God the means to his salvation. As with Herbert, Donne is also concerned with his soul. In \"Sonnet X,\" Donne demands that God \"Batter my heart.\" The poet asks for God to ravish him and save him from Satan. This is a more violent poem than either Herbert or Milton write. The jaggedness and choppiness of the verse suggest the emotion of the content. For Donne, salvation is brought through a more violent questioning, rather than through praise. Donne implores God to defeat their common enemy, Satan. He foresees salvation only if God imprisons him within his grace. In his less angry poems, Donne substitutes images for demands, but he still holds back from simple praise. In \"Sonnet IX,\" Donne calls forth an image of the crucifixion and uses a meditative format to find his way to God: Donne calls forth the image, analyzes the image, and then prays to God. This method, while different from the one that Herbert uses, is still focused on finding a way to salvation. Donne plays with the sonnet's rhyme scheme by blending the English and the Italian sonnet and creating his own format, one that Herbert also uses. The first two quatrains of the sonnet maintain the English formula, abab cdcd, but the final quatrain is changed from the English formula, efef, to the Italian formula, effe, and an English couplet, gg, is added to complete the sonnet. By modifying both content and rhyme, Donne alters the traditional formulas, moving his sonnets away from both the early incarnation by Wyatt and the later reincarnation by Shakespeare, and into a format by which the poet can dialogue with God. Herbert's use of the sonnet differs slightly from that of Donne. Herbert also demands answers from God, although he is not as strident in his demands. In \"Prayer (I),\" Herbert uses the sonnet as a prayer to God, but one notable difference from Donne's format is that Herbert removes the division between octave and sestet. There is no posing of a question in the first two quatrains, nor is there a response in the sestet. Herbert does not use verbs in his sonnet/prayer; instead, the poem is a series of noun phrases, which mirror the content: a demand for answers from God.\n\nWhat Do I Read Next?\n\nJohn Milton , published in 1991 by Oxford University Press, is a complete edition of Milton's poetry and prose works, with extensive textual notes.\n\n, published in 1991 by Oxford University Press, is a complete edition of Milton's poetry and prose works, with extensive textual notes.

Sir Thomas Browne: Selected Writings (1995) is edited by Claire Preston and published by Carcanet Press, Limited. Browne, one of Milton's contemporaries, is best known for his essays and treatises that explore religion and melancholy, important issues in seventeenth-century thought.\n\nThe changes that Shakespeare, Donne, and Herbert make in the sonnet establish the poets' authority to play with or to manipulate the traditional format of the sonnet. As Donne and Herbert did in their sonnets, Milton also sets up a dialogue with God in \"When I Consider How My Light Is Spent,\" his poem on his blindness. Like Herbert, Milton is also wondering about his ability to serve God. Half his days are gone and he thinks he has not fulfilled all that his talent had predicted. Now he is blind, and in response, Milton questions how he can accomplish what he was sure God intended him to accomplish. The poet is discussing the most difficult moment of his life and wondering if he will be unable to reach his goals. The first part of the sonnet, the octave, is focused on Milton's questioning of how best to serve God if he is blind; the sestet is the voice of patience, of God, who provides the answer just as he did for Herbert. Milton is told that \"They also serve who only stand and wait.\" By standing, of course, the poet has not fallen to sin/Satan. But, in patience, rather than in despair, God provides the answer and reassurance. Milton departs from Herbert's use of praise and instead seeks his salvation through questioning. Although he is chastised by patience to \"prevent that murmur,\" the idea of questioning God is a tactic also used by Donne. Finally, the poem ends on a note of hope, as with Herbert's sonnet. Milton uses the form and the theme of the sonnet to suit his purpose. He uses the Italian format in the octave, abbaabba, but varies the sestet in composition. In this sonnet, the sestet's rhyme is the traditional Italian, cdecde, but in \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three,\" Milton varies the sestet's rhyme to cdedce. In this case, the complicated rhyme of the sestet reflects the complicated theme, the problem of time. The resolution of the octave's problem is in the production of the sestet: the poet has produced his poem in spite of the restrictions of time. In another sonnet, \"To The Lord General Cromwell,\" Milton responds to a political problem. The army wants to name Cromwell king, but Milton is asking Cromwell not to accept this offer. The octave flatters Cromwell, but the change in the sonnet's direction comes in the sestet and the more subtle movement to a request that is signified with the use of the word \"yet.\" The rhyme of the sestet changes also. Instead of the traditional Italian form, the sestet cddcee ends in a couplet, which reflects the pairings also found in the poem: \"war and detractions\" in line 2, and \"faith\" and \"fortitude\" in line 3.\n\nAlthough Milton is composing sonnets in the seventeenth century, his sonnets reflect both the style and content, though modified, of the typical sixteenth-century sonnet. Shakespeare altered the form and the content slightly to reflect his own needs and objectives, and Milton altered it again to reflect the needs of his poetry. Milton takes what he wishes from the Italian sonnet, largely the octave's rhyme, but he creates a sestet that reflects his own themes. Content, too, is open to modification. Where Shakespeare used the sonnet to explore a variety of secular ideas, the poets who followed in the early seventeenth century turned to religion, especially as a dialogue with God. The pinnacle of this adaption of the traditional sonnet is reached with Milton, who finds the sonnet a useful vehicle for exploring time, politics, and his own personal pain, as well as to reaffirm his belief that God has not abandoned him.\n\nSource: Sheri E. Metzger, Critical Essay on \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three,\" in Poetry for Students, The Gale Group, 2003.\n\nCarol Dell'Amico\n\nDell'Amico is a college instructor of English literature and composition. In this essay, Dell'Amico considers Milton's poem within the contexts of the poet's career, his influence on other poets, and the nature of his religious beliefs.\n\nPoems that are not given titles by their writers, such as this one by Milton, tend to be identified by their first line (\"How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth\"). About fifty years after Milton's death, however, this poem was dubbed \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three.\" This title was immediately popular and has endured, even if some scholars of Milton wonder whether in saying that \"Time\" has \"Stol'n\" his \"three-and-twentieth year\" Milton is actually saying that he is commemorating in this poem his twenty-fourth and not his twenty-third birthday (in this case, what has been \"Stol'n\" is not really his twenty-third year of life, but rather that year which begins with the poet already at the age of twenty-three).\n\nWhile this matter of the precise date of this poem is interesting (1631 or 1632?), it is, nevertheless, a minor point in the criticism, as Milton does not change radically as a writer in between his twenty-third and twenty-fourth years. Rather, scholars tend to divide Milton's career into three phases: a first period that ends around 1640 (during which time he wrote \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\"), a second period during which he devoted himself to political, reformist writing (1640\u20131660), and a third period in which he returns to poetry and writes his greatest works, most notably the epic poem Paradise Lost.\n\nMore significant than the precise year of the poem's composition, then, are matters such as its sentiments and form, specifically the way in which the pious Christian sentiments of the poem presage the mood and concerns of Milton's later poetry and the way in which its form proved to be so influential. \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\" is a sonnet, which is a particular type of poem, and it is a sonnet organized in a manner that had yet to be tried in English literature. Following Milton's adoption of this different sonnet form, his poetic contemporaries began writing sonnets in the same way, and they emulated, as well, his writing of sonnets on subjects other than love (sonnets written in English before Milton were usually love poems).\n\nSonnets were first written in England in the sixteenth century and had fallen out of fashion by the time Milton began writing them. They were (and always are) written according to strict rules and conventions, and the sonnet form preferred by Milton's predecessors tended to be fourteen line sonnets divided up into three quatrains and one couplet (a quatrain is a set of four lines; a couplet is a set of two lines).\n\nWhat readers and other poets particularly appreciated about Milton's different sonnets was his use of a wholly different line arrangement, namely an octave (a set of eight lines as two linked quatrains), followed by a sestet (a set of six lines as two tercets, or two groupings of three lines). Although Milton, as in this poem, occasionally added an extra line or two to this major two-part arrangement, this different sonnet form is nevertheless characterized by its primary, central octave and sestet.\n\nWhat this type of two-part sonnet encourages are poetic meditations that first introduce or set up a problem in the octave and then resolve or reflect upon the problem in the sestet. This problem-resolution structure allowed Milton and the poets who emulated him to address more mundane topics than love in their sonnets, topics in politics, for example, or, as in this poem, topical subjects. What \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\" considers, specifically, is the problem of the poet's belated creative maturity. Milton already knew by this time that he wished to be a great writer, and his problem is that he is growing older but still has not produced the sort and amount of work that might be expected of one with such ambitions: \"My hasting days fly on with full career / But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.\" In these lines, Milton complains that his years are advancing but he has little to show for them; no real \"bud or blossom\" is in evidence.\n\nMilton's poem exemplifies the problem-solution organization of the octave-sestet sonnet form. The poet has no sooner stated that he sees \"no bud or blossom\" to show for his years than he states that he even looks younger than his age: \"Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth / That I to manhood am arrived so near.\" Milton's \"semblance\" was deceptive in his early twenties, scholars say, because his delicate, feminine facial features made him appear much younger than he really was.\n\nMoving on from the matter of his outward appearance, Milton returns in the octave's next lines to the problem of his professional belatedness. He points to some \"more timely-happy spirits\" who have achieved feats commensurate with their age, persons whose \"ripeness\" would seem to accord with their stage in life: \"And inward ripeness doth much less appear, / That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.\" Critics suggest that Milton had in mind close friends who, like himself, had chosen writing as their profession, but who, unlike Milton, had already published substantially by their early twenties.\n\nThe octave's focus is, therefore, quite clear. The poet is wondering whether his tardiness to mature might mean that he will never mature at all, whether his ambition to become a writer of renown may never come to be. This would be a catastrophe for Milton, for he had set himself by this time a strict course of reading and study, all to the end of becoming a master of English letters. Indeed, Milton is said to have gone blind in 1651 owing to his prodigious reading during these years of apprenticeship; he is said to have read, in his early manhood, everything of note written in English, Latin, Italian, and Greek.\n\nThe sestet and final, extra line of Milton's sonnet solves the problem put forth in the octave by re-conceiving time and ambition. Milton subordinates his own, individual ambitions to God's will in the sestet, and he substitutes God's eternal time for mortal, human time. Milton has thus decided by the end of this poem that his own ambitions are secondary to God's plans for him, that he will submit to God's will, and that in submitting to God's will in this way he no longer feels keenly the possibility of any personal disappointment. Milton's regret over his advancing age (mortal time) and belated development pales in significance once the rule and time of Heaven and God is considered.\n\nThus, where time is that which is \"hasting\" or accumulating rapidly in the octave, \"Time\" is that which is meaningful only in terms of \"the will of Heaven\" in the sestet. As critic R. F. Hall noted in The Cambridge Companion to Milton, edited by Dennis Danielson, time in the poem seems to \"slow down\" in the sestet, so that by the\n\nend of the poem, it is as if movement has become an irrelevance under the divine eye which gazes in eternal stasis at the poet (and us), yet provides the grace which it is the poet's choice to use in order to transform his relation to time and ambition.\n\nMilton in the octave is a worried, ambitious young man who is comparing himself to friends and wondering when he will produce the creative work he so desires to compose. In the sestet, to the contrary, youthful worry and ambition dissolves as God's will is embraced.\n\nThis change of mood and perspective is evident in the very first line of the sestet: \"Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow.\" Instead of anxious concern over his development (\"it\"), this line expresses a sanguine acceptance of whatever the poet's personal pace and capabilities turn out to be. A creative output minor or major\u2014\"less\" or \"more\"\u2014is acceptable; a development \"slow\" or quick (\"soon\") is likewise acceptable:\n\nYet be it less or more, or soon or slow,\n\nIt shall be still in strictest measure even\n\nTo that same lot, however mean or high,\n\nToward which Time leads me, and the will of\n\nHeaven;\n\nThis attitude of acceptance comes about because Milton in the sestet is not conceiving of himself as an individual, but rather as a servant and subject of the Christian Almighty, God. What he as an individual wants, he realizes, might not be what God has in store for him. Regardless of his own wishes, his progress is determined, ultimately, in \"strictest measure,\" by the Almighty. His \"lot\" will be that which God decides, and whether it is \"mean\" (low) or \"high,\" he will embrace it as \"the will of Heaven.\"\n\nYet, even as the sestet of the poem replaces worldly, mortal time and ambition with God's eternal time and will, there are, still, glimmerings of the youthful, hopeful Milton in the poem's last lines: \"As ever in my great Task-Master's eye. / The \"great Task-Master\" is God.\" As critic E. A. J. Honigmann suggests in Milton's Sonnets, \"Milton borrowed the word [Task-Master] not to complain of a harsh overseer but to suggest that he himself may have a special task, as a poet.\" Milton subordinates his life to God's will, but he is still hoping, at the poem's end, that God's \"grace\" portends what he especially longs for, namely greatness as a poet.\n\nThe mix of Christian humility and proud individualism in this poem is characteristic of much of Milton's writing, including his last works, and it says a great deal about both the nature of Milton's religiosity and of Christian belief in general at the time. What this period in Britain is known for are the many Christian reform movements that contested the hierarchical and elitist composition of the Church. Of particular importance to reformers was a new way of conceiving the status of the individual Christian in relation to priests, parsons, and other official church representatives. These reformers insisted that the individual Christian did not need an official church representative to be an intermediary in between him or herself and God. Rather, to the reformers, any Christian was, in God's eyes, as privileged as the next, and all Christians, regardless of their station in life, should consider themselves as godly as the next person, no matter that this person was a priest, bishop, and so on. What this teaching points to, on the one hand, is the deep piety of the reformers: they were propagating a version of Christianity that encouraged direct and constant communication with God. On the other hand, this teaching elevates the individual, as any person is deemed godly enough to commune with God directly. This suggests both the populism (a belief in the equality of persons) and individualism (the belief in the importance of the individual) of the movements, in that any and each individual on the planet was considered good enough to communicate directly with the greatest of beings himself, God Almighty. Milton and these other reformers were, then, pious populists and individualists of sorts.\n\nThe force of this Christian reform movement in England was immense, as its populism intersected with equally populist political movements, movements designed to replace England's monarchy with a republican (elected) form of government. These various reform movements led, in fact, to a Civil War, an upheaval in which Milton played an important role and whose major event was the deposing and execution, in 1649, of the King of England, Charles I. In 1660, however, monarchy was restored, and since Milton had been a vigorous and prolific writer in defense and support of the reformers, he was incarcerated at this time. Yet, thanks to the intervention of powerful friends, he was soon freed. He then settled into his final period of literary output, his greatest period in which he produced the poems for which he is most especially admired (Paradise Lost, Paradise Regained, and \"Samson Agonistes.\")\n\nSource: Carol Dell'Amico, Critical Essay on \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three,\" in Poetry for Students, The Gale Group, 2003.\n\nCarey Wallace\n\nWallace is a freelance writer and poet. In this essay, Wallace explores Milton's use of biblical imagery in his youthful discussion of his own destiny.\n\nWhen a young John Milton penned \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three,\" he was still a student at Cambridge University, working towards a master of arts degree, which he would receive the next year, at the age of twenty-four. Milton had been writing poems since the age of fifteen, and by the time he left Cambridge, he had accumulated a significant body of poetry: Latin elegies, translations of biblical psalms, and many pages of English verse.\n\nHe would wait almost another ten years before he began to publish widely, and even then the works he put his name to would be political or theological arguments, not poetry. Not until fourteen years later, at the age of thirty-seven, would his first volume of poems appear. His literary reputation would not be solidified until just before his sixtieth birthday, with the publication of his epic masterpiece, Paradise Lost.\n\nIn the meantime, Milton would live through some of the greatest upheaval in Western history. The Renaissance, with its new emphasis on the dignity of humanity, and its amazing scientific and artistic accomplishments, was still a recent memory, which led, both directly and indirectly, to great political and social upheaval. During Milton's lifetime, an English king would be deposed by his own people and replaced by Oliver Cromwell's socially-conservative Protectorate, which would itself be replaced by another member of the royal family.\n\nMilton underwent enormous personal turmoil: a famously fragile first marriage, the deaths of two children, public censure for his liberal opinions on divorce, political reversals as the English government shifted beneath his feet\u2014and, perhaps most significantly, his own blindness, which struck him at the age of forty-four, sixteen years before Paradise Lost was completed.\n\nModern readers approaching \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\" know something even Milton did not know about the poem at the time: the end of the story\u2014both the events of Milton's life and eventual death and the place he has taken in history. Since, in the poem, Milton looks forward over his life and wonders what he might turn out to be, the details of his personal life, and secondarily of the history he lived through, take on a special meaning. For many modern readers attempting to make sense of this early sonnet, the most salient detail of all may be that it was written in 1631.\n\nIn 1631, Milton was writing in modern English, but just barely. In fact, that date places him closer on the historical timeline to Chaucer's Middle English than to the English spoken by today's modern readers. That means that, for the average reader, Milton's language may initially seem difficult. But, a close examination reveals a sonnet that is actually quite beautiful in its simplicity\u2014one in which a young man ponders on the universal theme of destiny and what he might turn out to be.\n\nMilton opens the poem by describing time as a winged thief, one who has \"stol'n\" his \"threeand-twentieth year\"\u2014playing with a theme that is still common today, the sense that time often passes too quickly, with milestones appearing far before people believe they are ready. Not only has his twenty-third birthday arrived too quickly for Milton, but winged time shows no signs of slowing down: his \"hasting days fly on with full career.\" In this phrase, \"career\" takes an archaic meaning indicating high velocity.\n\nAlthough the days of Milton's life speed by, young Milton tells the reader that he is not sure what he has to show for himself, with the line \"But my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th.\" Milton's mention of \"late spring\" is a reference to the season of life he considers himself to be in: still in early adulthood, he is not yet in the \"summer\" of his life, but there are not, for him, many more days of springtime. Although spring usually brings with it the signs of the summer to come in the form of buds and blossoms that will yield summer flowers and fruit, Milton says that his life, as yet, shows no such concrete potential\u2014no buds or blossom from which to guess the shape of things to come or even prove that he may ever be fruitful.\n\nThere might be several reasons for this, Milton goes on to say. It could be simply that he does not look as old as he actually is: \"Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth / That I to manhood am arrived so near.\" But, the lack of outward proof of his maturity is not just an illusion, Milton admits. In fact, he finds his entire character still not as mature as other people of his age, a fact that he describes by continuing his blossom metaphor and comparing himself to unripe fruit: \"And inward ripeness doth much less appear, / That some more timely-happy spirits endu'th.\"\n\nFor Milton, as a student of the New Testament, this description of himself as a possibly barren plant must have had special resonance: it is highly unlikely that he could have chosen the metaphor without conscious awareness of its resemblance to a metaphor that Christ used during his famous encounter with a barren fig tree. In that story, Christ curses the tree for not bearing fruit in season and tells a parable that ends with Christ commanding that every tree that does not produce good fruit be cut down and thrown into the fire. For the young Milton, then, bearing fruit would not mean just a matter of personal success\u2014it was a matter of spiritual life or death.\n\nIn the next lines, however, Milton softens his judgment of himself with hope for the future, in language that echoes St. Paul's well-known statement on the love of God, in which he affirms that \"neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.\" (Romans 8:38-39) Milton's next phrases, while not identical, are very similar to St. Paul's cadence, and take a similar stand of hope in God in spite of any circumstance: \"Yet be it [inward ripeness] less or more, or soon or slow, / It shall be still in strictest measure even / To that same lot, however mean or high, / Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heaven.\" Milton even imitates St. Paul's slightly asymmetrical listing, interrupting himself with the long phrase \"It shall be still in strictest measure even / To that same lot,\" before continuing his list of circumstances with \"however mean or high.\" In these lines, the archaic use of \"even\" roughly substitutes for the modern \"equal.\" Whether he matures more or less, or quickly or slowly, Milton says, his maturity will exactly equal the life, however small or great, which God has planned for him.\n\nMilton's closing lines paraphrase another statement of St. Paul, also in Romans 8, in perhaps the saint's most powerful teaching on the working of God in human destiny, when he says that \"In all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose\" (Romans 8:28). Although Milton has yet to bud or flower, he remains certain of God's attention and care: \"All is, if I have grace to use it so, / As ever in my great Task-Master's eye.\" As he makes this claim, even time, which Milton initially figured as a somewhat hostile winged thief, becomes part of the pattern of \"all things\" in which, Milton and St. Paul assert, God works. By the end of the sonnet, time is no longer working against Milton, stealing his youth, but a partner (and implicitly a servant) of the \"Will of Heaven,\" leading Milton inexorably toward his destiny.\n\nThroughout the poem, Milton achieves a delicate balance in the age-old tension between free will and predestination. His reference to Christ and the unproductive fig tree and his meditations on his own achievements reveal a deep sense of his own responsibility\u2014but he is also aware that the forces that will shape his character, and his destiny, are finally in God's hands, not his own. Even as he finds a measure of peace through his argument for belief in the providence of God, he acknowledges that he must still act well within the circumstances time and Heaven give him, that he must \"have the grace to use it so.\"\n\nTo modern readers looking back, Milton's poem may seem almost prophetic. Milton knew himself well when he wrote that he was not yet inwardly ripe at twenty-three. Even after graduation at twenty-four, he would return to his parents' home to continue his private studies for almost eight years before he began publishing in earnest. He would not solidly establish himself as one of the brightest stars in the English literary constellation for another forty years. But, his sense of destiny, of the finger of God on his life, proved to be no lie. No generation of readers since has been able to ignore Milton: his work has been widely reprinted, and read, in every century since his death, and many critics place him secondary only to Shakespeare among English poets. Even his prose works continued to affect the destinies of humanity long after his death: his writings against tyranny formed part of the framework for revolution in both America and France, and \"Areopagitica,\" his 1644 defense of free speech, has even figured in modern United States court decisions.\n\nAlthough \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three\" is profoundly interesting given Milton's historical context, Milton's true genius is revealed in the fact that, even if he had never become the towering literary figure he did, the poem would stand alone as a universal document of human experience. In it, Milton captures the essence of the moment at which a young person stands on the cusp of adulthood, looking both forward and back, and asking themselves the same questions that every young person, at some point, asks: What have I accomplished here, yet? What do I have to show for it? What should I do next? How do my plans intersect with a future I can barely see? Which way is my destiny? What is going to happen? What does Time hold, what does Heaven have planned?\n\nIn the midst of all these questions, Milton's poem offers comfort to the reader\u2014not because Milton finally succeeded, but because, as he and St. Paul both assert, despite any circumstance, destiny lies finally in God's great hands.\n\nSource: Carey Wallace, Critical Essay on \"On His Having Arrived at the Age of Twenty-Three,\" in Poetry for Students, The Gale Group, 2003.\n\nSources\n\nDorian, D.

In the early 1860's cricket was the only organised game of note in the town and the normal venue for this activity was the Marsh, an irregular stop of land on the Ribble Estuary at Ashton and which today is the site for the GEC works. Cricket can be linked with Wellfield Road School.\n\nIn that year there was a split amongst the club members when the majority opted for a move to Moor Park where the Corporation had opened a public Cricket ground. The newly formed club using Moor Park was named North End simply as an indication of the club\u2019s base being in the north end of the town.\n\nThe first President was George Howarth and subscriptions were 2d a week. The club fell on hard times and almost disbanded, but new members were recruited to ease the financial crisis and one of these new comers was William Sudell who became a member on 3rd August 1867 when he was 16-years-old, having lived in the town all his life. He was a good swimmer and cyclist, a keen cricketer and a very good rugby forward.\n\nIn spite of the financial problems not being resolved, the members made a memorable and courageous step on 21st January 1875 when they took a lease on a field at Deepdale, a field which was to be the home of the finest football team of the era.\n\n\n\nPlaying cricket and dabbling in other games such as lacrosse and rounders were not financially viable and so in 1877 members turned to rugby. Unfortunately, this venture was a failure since the club could not compete with the Grasshoppers who were already a well-established force. On the 5th October 1878 North End played its first game under association rules against Eagley. The game was played at Deepdale and was lost 1-0. For the record the team that played this game were: W Sudell, W Turner, J Sefton, T Charnley, T Wadeson, J Wadeson, C Miller, T Parkinson, JF Dodgson, R Green and H S Carmel (Cpt)."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50340459", "page_content": "Scenes from England's first international, against Scotland in 1872, which were published in The Graphic on 14 December 1872. The original artist was a W. Ralston\n\nFor all the tears, turmoil and triumphs in England's first 999 games, it is trophies - or a lack of them - that have shaped the Three Lions' story so far.\n\nBut despite the national team having won only one World Cup since their first match in 1872, did you know they have actually collected another 60 titles along the way?\n\nYes, take a look back at some of the Three Lions' most memorable moments of the past 147 years and you will see they have secured a lot more silverware than you might think, including some trinkets you may never have heard of before.\n\nAs well as the glory and the goals - 3,172 in total, at both ends - there has been plenty of gloom too of course - and not just the fog that caused a game versus Czechoslovakia to be abandoned in 1975, one of only three England matches that have failed to finish.\n\nAs Gareth Southgate's side host Montenegro at Wembley on Thursday in their 1,000th senior men's international, BBC Sport takes a look back through the mists of time to try to identify the key names and numbers in England's journey, with the help of statisticians Opta and the Football Association's associate historian, Brian Beard.\n\nBrazil are not England's only bogey team\n\nImages of England celebrating their 1966 World Cup win are among the most iconic from their 999 matches so far. The FA has invited all the surviving members of that team to Wembley on Thursday, along with all former England captains and England players with 50 or more caps\n\nEngland's most common result is a 1-1 draw - they have had 102 of those - but they have won 568 of their 999 games so far, against 91 different opponents.\n\nOf those 91 teams, 54 have never beaten England while there are six sides who have never lost to the Three Lions - Saudi Arabia (who they have played twice), Algeria, CIS (the Commonwealth of Independent States formed in 1991 to take part in Euro '92 after the Soviet Union formally ceased to exist), Ghana, Honduras and South Korea - all of whom got a draw in their only meeting to date.\n\nOverall, counting every official game they have played, including those against teams representing the rest of Europe and the rest of the world, England have got a 100% winning record against 29 sides, and a winning ratio of more than 50% against 58 of them.\n\nThe team they have played the most without losing to is Bulgaria - recording eight wins and four draws, while they have a superior head-to-head record against 76 teams, and are behind against six - Brazil, Germany (not including games against West Germany), Italy, Netherlands, Romania and Uruguay.\n\nTheir worst win ratio against any team they have played more than twice is against Brazil - 15%, or four wins from 26 games - although they have a worse recent record against a number of sides.\n\nIn what seems an odd quirk, England have not beaten Romania in any of their past seven meetings, six of them competitive, since 1970, and are on an identical run against the Republic of Ireland, dating back to 1985.\n\nEngland's worst win % comes against these teams Team P W Win % Last win?

Unsurprisingly, they have played more away games north of the border (57 games, 20 wins) than anywhere else, but they have won the most in Wales (51 games, 33 wins).\n\nThey have won games in 69 countries so far and will get the chance to make it 70 when they play Kosovo away for the first time in Prishtina on Sunday, but are currently winless in Argentina, Iceland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Tunisia out of the places they have already played.\n\nOf the 80 current Fifa members they have played (out of a total of 210), they have a superior head-to-head record against 66, and are level with eight more.\n\nWhere England have played their 999 matches Venue P W D L F A Win % Home 433 279 93 61 1053 387 64.4% Away 442 242 109 91 973 973 54.8% Neutral 124 47 39 38 162 130 37.9%\n\nPredictably, their most-used venue was the old Wembley stadium, their home from 1924 to 2000, but their most successful stadium is Anfield, where they won on seven out of eight occasions, drawing the other.\n\nOn their travels, there are three grounds where England share their best record - winning four out of four matches at Ballynafeigh Park in Belfast, Stade Josy Barthel in Luxembourg and the Vasil Levski National Stadium in Sofia, where England's 999th game was held - a 6-0 win over Bulgaria in October.\n\nTheir three abandoned games all came away from home, firstly in a friendly against Argentina in Buenos Aires in 1953 when a downpour after 25 minutes left the pitch unplayable.\n\nHeavy fog in Prague in 1975 meant a European qualifier with Czechoslovakia had to be curtailed after 17 minutes. When it was played the following night, England could see again, but lost 2-1.\n\nAnd their game against the Republic of Ireland at Lansdowne Road in 1995 was stopped after 27 minutes, with the Republic leading 1-0, when England fans began rioting and throwing seats and other debris into the stand below them. The game was called off 12 minutes later.\n\nFurthermore, the Ibrox disaster of April 1902 was the only time an England game was completed but then scrubbed from the records. A wooden stand collapsed during the first half and 25 spectators lost their lives, with another 500 injured, but the game continued because officials feared a mass panic if it was called off.\n\nThat game with Scotland finished 1-1 and a replay at Villa Park was drawn 2-2 a month later, with all proceeds going to victims.\n\nA section of the terracing that collapsed during the 1902 Ibrox disaster\n\nGames against British or Irish opponents are relatively rare these days, and have been since the abolition of the annual British or Home Championship in 1984.\n\nBut England did not actually play anyone else home or away until their 95th game, when they beat Austria 6-1 in Vienna in June 1908, following that up with an 11-1 win against the same opponents two days later as they embarked on a tour of central Europe.\n\nBelgium were the first foreign (defined for this purpose as non-British or Irish) team to avoid defeat, with a 2-2 draw in Antwerp in 1923 in England's 138th game, while Spain were the first to beat them.\n\nThat 4-3 loss in Madrid in 1929 ended England's run of 20 wins and one draw in games against such opposition and came in their 167th game overall. The Czech Republic were the most recent foreign side to claim their first victory when they won in Prague last month.\n\nWho has played? The long and short of it\n\nA total of 1,244 players have made senior appearances for England and, going into the match against Montenegro, every one of them has now been given their own 'legacy number' by the Football Association, chronologically recording the order of their first cap for their country.\n\nRobert Barker of Hertfordshire Rangers, who started England's first game in goal before switching with Bill Maynard to play outfield, is number one.\n\nAston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, the most recent debutant after playing against Bulgaria in October, is number 1,244.\n\nStuart Pearce became number 999 when he started England's 625th game, a 1-1 draw with Brazil in 1987. His Nottingham Forest team-mate Neil Webb, who replaced Glenn Hoddle in the same game, was number 1,000.\n\nThree Lions boss Gareth Southgate, who played 57 times for his country between 1995 and 2004, is number 1,071\n\nOnly three players are known to have played for another country in an official (non-wartime match) before representing England: Robert Ernest Evans (Wales) John (or Jack) Reynolds (Ireland) and most recently Declan Rice (Republic of Ireland).\n\nSimilarly, only four players have played for England's senior side and then gone on to represent someone else - John Hawley Edwards (Wales), Jackie Sewell (Zambia), Ken Armstrong (New Zealand) and Wilfried Zaha (Ivory Coast).\n\nThere have been 122 England captains, including all nine players who have made 100 or more appearances, 356 who have made only one appearance - including the aforementioned Barker and, so far, Mings - plus 56 who have played for less than 90 minutes after being substituted either on or off in their only game.\n\nWith 125 appearances between 1970 and 1990, Peter Shilton has the most caps, while Sir Stanley Matthews had the longest career time-wise - there were 22 years and 228 days between his first cap in a 4-0 win against Wales on 29 September 1934 and his last, a 4-1 win over against Denmark on 15 May 1957.\n\nMatthews was 42 years and 103 days old when he played in Copenhagen, also making him England's oldest ever player. The youngest is Theo Walcott, who was aged 17 years and 75 days when he played in a 3-1 win over Hungary in May 2006.\n\nSeven minutes, one touch - this is the only time Nathaniel Chalobah has touched the ball in his brief England career to date\n\nThe award for the shortest England career is often given to Crystal Palace defender Martin Kelly, then of Liverpool, who came on in the 88th minute of a 1-0 win over Norway in 2012, but actually spent almost seven minutes on the pitch, including stoppage time.\n\nThe same applies to Watford's Nathaniel Chalobah, who was brought on in the 91st minute against Spain in 2018, but again played for seven minutes before the final whistle was blown.\n\nInstead that dubious honour falls to West Ham defender Jim 'Tiny' Barrett, who was injured after starting against Northern Ireland in 1928 and came off after only four minutes of his only appearance.\n\nOnly 15 players have been sent off while playing for England - the first was Alan Mullery in a European Championship match against Yugoslavia in 1968.\n\nEngland's win ratio is 57% overall but it plummets to 6% in those 15 games where they have been reduced to 10 men - their sole win coming against Austria in 2005 when David Beckham became their first player to receive two red cards while playing for his country.\n\nClubs for country - Tottenham lead the way\n\nA total of 143 clubs from home and abroad have provided England players, with the most recent additions being Spain's Atletico Madrid (for Kieran Trippier's three internationals this season), DC United of the United States (Wayne Rooney, in his farewell England appearance against the US in November 2018) and Germany's Borussia Dortmund (Jadon Sancho's debut came a month earlier in October 2018). Bournemouth became the latest English club in 2018 (Lewis Cook against Azerbaijan in March, followed by Callum Wilson, also against the US in November).\n\nSome West Ham fans like to claim they 'won' the 1966 World Cup because of the key role Hammers trio Bobby Moore, Sir Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters played in that triumph, but Tottenham are the team to have provided the most England players, with 78, and Manchester United players have won the most caps, with 1,039.\n\nOut of the 91 Premier League or Football League clubs, 58 have supplied them - Hull City, who are 11th in the Championship, are currently the highest ranked team to have never had an England player. The now defunct Bury FC provided six.\n\nFurther afield, AC Milan and Real Madrid (with four apiece) are the foreign clubs to have had the most England internationals.\n\nThe first player to appear for England while playing for a non-British club was Gerry Hitchens in 1962, when he was at Inter Milan.\n\nIn total 27 players have won a cap while playing abroad, with Beckham making the most appearances of this kind - 55 while he was at Real, LA Galaxy or AC Milan.\n\nOnly one team - devout amateurs Corinthian FC, who never played a competitive club match - have ever supplied the entire England XI, for their 5-1 win against Wales in 1894, although many of Corinthian's players were also simultaneously registered for other, professional, clubs.\n\nThe most players from a single professional club to play in the same England teams is seven - the number of Arsenal players who appeared on their own club's home turf against Italy in 1934, in a memorably violent game that became known as the 'Battle of Highbury'.\n\nGoals and glory - who has scored, and what have they won?\n\nWayne Rooney is the all-time record goalscorer for England\n\nEngland have scored in 833 of their 999 games, and average the most goals per game against Luxembourg - 47 in nine games, so 5.22 per match. They have scored their most in total against Wales (247) and there are only two teams they have never managed a goal against - Algeria and Honduras.\n\nTheir biggest win - 13-0 in 1882 - and biggest competitive win - 13-2 in 1899 - both came against Ireland but England have not hit double figures against anyone since they beat the United States 10-0 in a 1964 friendly, 14 years after their shock 1-0 defeat by the same opposition at the 1950 World Cup.\n\nAlthough some details from the 19th century are difficult to verify with total certainty, there are 429 different England goalscorers on record, with William Kenyon-Slaney the first against Scotland in 1873 and Jadon Sancho the most recent addition to the list, with his two goals against Kosovo in September.\n\nWhat we do know for sure is that Wayne Rooney is England's youngest goalscorer - he netted against Macedonia aged 17 years and 317 days in September 2003 - and also has the most goals overall, with 53.\n\nFour players - Howard Vaughton (against Ireland in 1882), Steve Bloomer (against Wales in 1896), Willie Hall (against Northern Ireland in 1958) and Malcolm Macdonald (against Cyprus in 1975) share the record for most in a single match, with five apiece.\n\nThe story of the 1966 World Cup\n\nJimmy Greaves has the most hat-tricks, with six, one ahead of Match of the Day host Gary Lineker, on five. A total of 83 players have scored trebles for England and the most famous is the one Sir Geoff Hurst scored in their 1966 World Cup final win.\n\nWhen it comes to silverware, England have had only one major international triumph from 33 attempts in a World Cup or European Championship, which came in the game above.\n\nBut in the British Home Championship, which was the first international tournament to be contested and ran for 100 years from 1883-84, they came out on top or shared victory 54 times.\n\nThe Rous Cup (left) and British International Championship trophy (right) were reunited at Hampden Park in 2008 for the opening of an exhibition about England's historic rivalry with Scotland. The trophies are pictured with then Scotland boss George Burley\n\nA trophy was only awarded to the winner from 1936, but England still got at least one hand on that a total of 30 times. It is now on display at the National Football Museum in Manchester.\n\nThe Home Championship was replaced by the Rous Cup in 1985, which saw England play Scotland and, latterly, a random guest South American team. It only lasted for five years, but England won it on three occasions.\n\nMore success followed in the England Challenge Cup, played against Argentina and the Soviet Union at Wembley in May 1991, the 1997 Tournoi de France where England finished above Brazil, Italy and the hosts, and also the snappily titled FA Summer Tournament, which was held at what is now known as Etihad Stadium in 2004, and saw England overcome Japan and Iceland.\n\nEven less formally, using a boxing-style winners system going back to that first international in 1872, England have been unofficial world champions external-link on 22 separate occasions, most recently when they beat Germany in June 2000 before they lost the 'title' to bogey-team Romania in their next match, going out of Euro 2000 in the process.\n\nWho has scored against them?\n\nThere have been 984 goals scored against England but is this the best? Zlatan Ibrahimovic nets with a 30-yard bicycle kick in a 4-2 win for Sweden in November 2012\n\nEngland have kept 405 clean sheets - Peter Shilton has the most, with 66 in his 125 appearances, followed by Joe Hart, with 43 in 75 games, and David Seaman with 40 in 75.\n\nOut of the 91 teams they have played, 21 have never managed a goal against them. Scotland have scored the most in total, with 174, but Germany average the most per game, with 23 in 16 matches, or 1.43.\n\nEngland's heaviest defeat came in Budapest in May 1954, when they lost 7-1 to Hungary just six months after the 'Marvellous Magyars' beat them 6-3 at Wembley.\n\nOn home turf, England's biggest loss was their 6-1 defeat against Scotland in 1881, at Kennington Oval.\n\nAt the old Wembley stadium, the Scots also claimed the biggest win - 5-1 in 1928. At the new Wembley, only one of England's eight defeats has been by more than a one-goal margin - when Chile beat them 2-0 in 2013, through two Alexis Sanchez goals.\n\nScotland's John McDougall was the first player to score a hat-trick against England - and also the first player to manage one in international football when he scored three times in a 7-2 win in 1878.\n\nA total of nine players have managed three goals in one game against England - four of them Scots.\n\nAnd the last word, as is so often the case, goes to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose stunning display for Sweden in 2012 - which included an acrobatic overhead kick - means he is the only player to have scored four against the Three Lions."}, {"url": "https://www.melbournefc.com.au/history/year-by-year", "page_content": "1939\n\nFrank \u2018Checker\u2019 Hughes coaches Melbourne to its third VFL premiership, when it defeats Collingwood in the Grand Final by 53 points at the MCG.

After losing to Essendon by 36 points in the second semi-final at the MCG, the Demons easily account for Collingwood by 65 points in the preliminary final at the MCG. In the drawn Grand Final, Essendon\u2019s remarkable inaccuracy \u2013 it kicks 7.27 (69) to Melbourne\u2019s 10.9 (69) \u2013 allows the Demons another tilt at premiership success, which it takes.

Bert Chadwick becomes chairman and Alan Thomson is named secretary. Club greats Don Cordner and Jack Mueller retire.\n\n1951\n\nMelbourne produces one of its worst VFL/AFL season, winning just one game to claim its fifth wooden spoon.

Melbourne wins its second under 19s premiership.\n\n1954\n\nMelbourne rises to make the Grand Final \u2013 its first since 1948. It\u2019s a fine achievement, given it finishes in the bottom two the previous two years, but the Demons fall to Footscray by 51 points at the MCG. It\u2019s the Bulldogs\u2019 first VFL premiership. Geoff Collins captains Melbourne, as Denis Cordner, who is regarded as Melbourne\u2019s best in the Grand Final, wins his second best and fairest award and Noel Clarke leads the club\u2019s goal tally with 51. It\u2019s the start of a golden era, as the club reaches the first of seven successive Grand Finals. Melbourne greats Brian Dixon, \u2018Big\u2019 Bob Johnson, Clyde Laidlaw, Laurie Mithen and Ian Ridley make their debut.\n\n1955\n\nAfter playing off in the 1954 Grand Final, Melbourne wins its seventh premiership \u2013 and its first under Norm Smith. The Demons defeat Collingwood by 11 points in the second semi-final at the MCG, before beating the Magpies again, this time by 28 points in the Grand Final at the home of football. The game was highlighted by the infamous Des Healey (Collingwood)/Frank Adams clash, which saw both players stretchered off. Healey is later forced into retirement. It\u2019s the start of Melbourne\u2019s greatest winning streak, when it wins 19 matches from round 15, 1955 to round 13, 1956.

The Demons win their opening 13 rounds and use just 27 players for the season. Melbourne beats Collingwood by 16 points in the second semi-final at the MCG, before smashing the Pies by 73 points in the Grand Final in front of a crowd of 115,902 \u2013 then the greatest crowd in VFL history.

It\u2019s a remarkable era for the club, as Norm Smith coaches his fifth flag. After winning the minor premiership, Melbourne defeats Fitzroy by 62 points in the second semi-final at the MCG.

Over this period, Melbourne claims 108 wins and two draws from 141 matches. The Demons get knocked out in straight sets, falling seven points short to Hawthorn in the second semi-final at the MCG and then 27 points to Footscray in the preliminary final at the \u2018G. Ron Barassi wins the best and fairest award and Bob B. Johnson heads the club\u2019s goalkicking with 36 majors. Terry Johnston ties for the Morrish Medal. Melbourne plays two exhibition games at the end of the season in New Zealand.\n\n1962\n\nIn January, Bert Chadwick resigns as chairman, after being in the role since 1950. Although Melbourne has a better home and away season than 1957 and 1959, after winning 14 games and dropping just four matches, the Demons finish third. After narrowly losing to Carlton by two points in the first semi-final at the MCG, Melbourne ends the season in fourth place. Hassa Mann wins the best and fairest and Laurie Mithen, in his final VFL season, kicks 37 majors to lead the club\u2019s goalkicking. Clyde Laidlaw, Geoff Tunbridge, Geoff Case and Trevor Johnson are among the retirees. 1926 premiership player Dick Taylor, who is one of Melbourne\u2019s VFL delegates, passes away.\n\n\n\nRon Barassi in portrait\n\n1963\n\nMelbourne finishes third for the season, after defeating St Kilda in the first semi-final by seven points at the MCG. It then falls nine points short to Hawthorn in the preliminary final at the \u2018G. Hassa Mann wins back-to-back best and fairest awards and Barry Bourke kicks 48 goals to top Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking. In round five, Collingwood becomes the first side since Footscray in the 1954 Grand Final to score 100 points against the Demons \u2013 and incredible feat. It scores 15.10 (100). Donald Duffy becomes club president. The Demons defeat Geelong in Honolulu and San Francisco at season\u2019s end.\n\n1964\n\nMelbourne wins its 12th and most recent premiership. The Demons win 14 of 18 matches during the home and away season, before smashing Collingwood in the second semi-final by 89 points at the MCG. Melbourne then hangs on for a thrilling four-point win over the Magpies in the Grand Final at the \u2018G. After Magpie Ray Gabelich puts Collingwood in front, late in the match, Melbourne back-pocket Neil \u2018Froggy\u2019 Crompton follows his man up the field, before winning the ball from a spilt pack and slotting through his only goal for the season. It seals Melbourne\u2019s victory. It\u2019s also the seventh time Melbourne and Collingwood meet in the Grand Final, with the Demons six to one. It\u2019s also the end of the club\u2019s golden era, winning 10 flags in 25 years \u2013 a remarkable achievement. Melbourne\u2019s 11 consecutive seasons in the finals also comes to an end. It\u2019s not until 1987 that the club plays in the finals again. Norm Smith coaches his sixth premiership from eight Grand Finals. This leads him to being named VFL/AFL coach of the century in 1996. Ron Barassi captains Melbourne to his second flag and he wins his second best and fairest with the club. John Townsend tops Melbourne\u2019s goal tally with 35. Melbourne also claims the minor premiership. Melbourne\u2019s under 19s also wins the flag. At the end of the season, Ron Barassi shocks the football world when he announces he\u2019s leaving Melbourne to become Carlton captain-coach.\n\n1965\n\nAfter winning its opening eight matches of the season, Melbourne manages just two more victories from its final 10 games. It results in the Demons missing the finals for the first time since 1953. One of the biggest football stories of all-time occurs, when Norm Smith is sensationally sacked after round 12, when issues with the committee comes to a head. He finds out his fate via letter. Frank \u2018Checker\u2019 Hughes comes out of retirement for Melbourne\u2019s round 12 match against North Melbourne at Coburg Oval \u2013 the club\u2019s only game at the venue \u2013 before Smith is reinstated for round 13. Although Smith guides Melbourne to victory upon his return, the club loses its final four rounds. In the end, the red and blue finishes seventh. Hassa Mann takes over as captain, following the departure of Barassi to Carlton, while John Townsend wins the club best and fairest. Barrie Vagg boots 30 goals to head Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking.\n\n1966\n\nMelbourne slides to second last on the ladder, notching up just three wins \u2013 its worst season since 1953. A staggering 23 players make their debut for Melbourne during the season. At just 19 years and 354 days, Terry Leahy becomes the youngest winner of Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest, as Barrie Vagg goes back-to-back in the club\u2019s goalkicking with 20 majors.\n\n1967\n\nMelbourne moves back up the ladder, winning eight games to finish seventh. It proves to be Norm Smith\u2019s final season as Melbourne coach, after he retires at the end of the season. He leaves as Melbourne\u2019s greatest coach and one of the club\u2019s most influential figures, having coached the club to a record 307 games. During the season, Smith\u2019s brother Len passes away after a series of heart attacks. Smith misses the second half of the round 15 match against Carlton at Princes Park and the following round against Footscray at the MCG, because of his own heart complaint. John Beckwith takes over as coach on both occasions. Gary Hardeman and future Australian Test cricketer Max Walker make their debut for the Demons. Captain Hassa Mann has an outstanding season, winning the best and fairest and topping the club goalkicking with 38.\n\n\n\nHassa Mann claimed the 1968 Best and Fairest\n\n1968\n\nDual premiership captain John Beckwith takes over as coach from the legendary Norm Smith. Future Tasmanian premier Ray Groom wins the club\u2019s best and fairest, and Hassa Mann tops Melbourne goal tally for the second year running with 29. The Demons claim eight wins from 20 matches, coming eighth on the ladder. Phil Rhoden wins the Gardiner Medal and Paul Callery claims the Morrish Medal. Hassa Mann and Brian Dixon retire at the season\u2019s end. Dixon finishes with 252 games to his name \u2013 then a club record.\n\n1969\n\nMelbourne claims its first wooden spoon since 1951, managing just three wins. In his final VFL season, Tassie Johnson captains the club, as John Townsend wins his second best and fairest award and Ross Dillon tops Melbourne goalkicking with 48. Ron Barassi comes out of retirement to play one match against Melbourne at Princes Park. He plays one match to reach 50 games with Carlton, which means his son is eligible to play for the Blues. Melbourne plays in its first night series Grand Final, falling short to Hawthorn by five points at Lake Oval. Ken Emselle (who wins the Gardiner Medal), Barrie Vagg, Bryan Kenneally and Tony Anderson retire at season\u2019s end. Melbourne\u2019s reserves win the premiership.\n\n^ Back to top\n\nThe 1970s\n\n1970\n\nFrank Davis becomes captain and wins the best and fairest, as Ross Dillon heads Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking for the second year in a row with 41.

The Demons win six games and finish second last. Laurie Fowler wins his second club best and fairest, as Robert Flower kicks 33 majors to lead the goalkicking. Melbourne suffers its greatest ever loss, when Fitzroy wallops the Demons in round 17 at Waverley Park by 190 points. To this day, it\u2019s also the heaviest defeat in VFL/AFL history. At the time, Fitzroy\u2019s score of 36.22 (238) is also the highest ever in the VFL. That changes when Geelong thrashes the Brisbane Bears at Carrara in round seven, 1992, booting 37.17 (239). Incredibly, Melbourne defeats Essendon the following week at the MCG by 29 points. Robert Walters kicks nine goals in the win.

At the season\u2019s end, Ditterich resigns to take up a position as a director of a holiday resort in Queensland. Brent Crosswell, who leads the club\u2019s goalkicking with 31 goals, and Bill Nettlefold play their first season with Melbourne after becoming premiership players with North Melbourne. Greg Wells plays 12 games with Melbourne, before crossing to Carlton mid-season, where he features in the Blues\u2019 final 10 matches of the season, including two finals. In June, Melbourne breaks away from the Melbourne Cricket Club after almost 100 years of being a section of the club. A joint statement from the MCC and Melbourne says the Demons will now be \u201can autonomous body with responsibility for its own affairs and liabilities\u201d. As part of the split, Melbourne\u2019s administration shifts to Jolimont Terrace. Laurie Fowler wins his third club best and fairest. In July, Dick Seddon is appointed secretary. At the end of the season, Melbourne lands the great Ron Barassi as coach, after he takes out newspaper advertisements asking for fans\u2019 support. Overwhelmingly, he receives it from the Melbourne faithful. Once appointed, he says it will take \u201cfour to eight years\u201d until Melbourne is a force again. He proves to be correct. Previously, Barassi had signed a $30,000 deal with the Demons in 1977, which allowed them to have first option of his services at the end of 1980. Sir Billy Snedden becomes chairman.\n\n1981\n\nRon Barassi\u2019s first season back at the club proves to be one of Melbourne\u2019s poorest in VFL/AFL history. The Demons win just one game \u2013 against Footscray by one-point at the Western (Whitten) Oval in round three \u2013 as 46 players are used for the season. Melbourne claims its ninth wooden spoon. It\u2019s the equal most players to represent Melbourne in one season, along with 1944, 1966, 1979 and later 1986. Robert Flower becomes captain \u2013 a position he holds until his retirement at the end of 1987. Future MCC chairman Steven Smith wins the club best and fairest and Mark \u2018Jacko\u2019 Jackson tops the club\u2019s goalkicking with 76 majors \u2013 in his first year with the club. Jackson is one of a host of colourful characters to play for the Demons in 1981, along with Peter \u2018Crackers\u2019 Keenan and Brent Crosswell. Melbourne\u2019s under 19s wins the flag. Adrian Battiston wins the Morrish Medal.\n\n1982\n\nMelbourne has its first Brownlow Medal winner since Don Cordner in 1946, when Brian Wilson claims the award. It\u2019s a fine win by Wilson after he is moved on by North Melbourne at the end of the 1981 season. The 20-year-old becomes the youngest Brownlow Medal winner since the great Bob Skilton in 1959. In Ron Barassi\u2019s second year as coach, Melbourne makes progress, winning eight games to finish eighth. Steven Icke, in his first year with the club after crossing from North Melbourne, wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest award, as Gerard Healy boots 77 majors to top the club\u2019s goalkicking. Alan Johnson, Melbourne\u2019s first drafted player (in the forgotten 1981 draft), makes his VFL debut. Melbourne wins back-to-back Morrish Medals, with Les Bamblett claiming the award.\n\n\n\nBrian Wilson won the Brownlow Medal in 1982\n\n1983\n\nMelbourne unveils boom recruits, Peter Moore from Collingwood and Kelvin Templeton from the Bulldogs. Both join Melbourne as Brownlow Medal winners, with Moore winning it in 1979 and Templeton in 1980. Football media great Mike Sheahan, still to this day, regards the recruitment Moore and Templeton as the biggest footy he\u2019s covered in the game. Alan Johnson wins the best and fairest and Robert Flower tops the goalkicking with 40 majors. The Demons win nine games and finish eighth for the second year running. The club wins the under 19s premiership. Future Melbourne captain Greg Healy wins the Morrish Medal. It\u2019s the third year in a row that the club claims a Morrish Medal.\n\n1984\n\nMelbourne shows genuine promise, winning six in a row from rounds eight to 13. Its 17-point win over Hawthorn in round 13 at Princes Park is one of the club\u2019s great wins of that era, as the Demons defeat the Hawks for the first time since round two, 1973. Despite sitting in fourth position after that round, Melbourne slips to ninth, ending the season with nine wins. Peter Moore wins his second Brownlow Medal \u2013 and first for the Demons. As was the case in 1979, when Moore won the Brownlow with Collingwood, Robert Flower again finishes third. In 1979, Moore polled 22 votes and Flower 19. This time, Moore gains 24 votes and Flower again polls 19. Gerard Healy wins the club best and fairest award and Kelvin Templeton boots 51 majors to head Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking. Melbourne wins the reserves flag.\n\n\n\n1984 Brownlow Medalist Peter Moore\n\n1985\n\nMelbourne is forced to move its training headquarters to the Junction Oval. The Demons are hit hard by injury, with captain Robert Flower playing just three matches due to a broken collarbone. Gerard Healy, Steven Smith, Peter Giles and Steven Icke skipper the side in Flower\u2019s absence, and they too suffer injuries while leading the side. Danny Hughes wins the club best and fairest award and Brian Wilson boots 40 goals to top Melbourne\u2019s goal tally. Sean Wight makes his debut for the club, after the Scotsman was recruited via the Irish experiment. Roy Gilbert is named chief executive, but resigns in July. Ray Manley takes over as CEO. Ron Barassi steps down as coach at the end of the season, with former Richmond player and Sydney Swans coach John Northey appointed. Gerard Healy leaves the club at the end of the season, joining the Swans.\n\n\n\nRon Barassi talks to the team in 1985 as coach\n\n1986\n\nStuart Spencer becomes chairman, taking over from Sir Billy Snedden. Melbourne finishes second last with seven wins in John Northey\u2019s first season as club coach. In June, it\u2019s revealed that Melbourne is in merger talks with Fitzroy. Greg Healy wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest and tops the club\u2019s goalkicking with 35 goals. Future captain Garry Lyon makes his debut. Melbourne records its highest VFL/AFL score: 28.14 (182) against North Melbourne in round 21 at the MCG. It equals the score in 1991. Melbourne selects Steven Febey (pick No.3 overall) with its first selection in what is regarded as the inaugural National Draft.\n\n\n\nCoach John Northey and Robert Flower in the rooms after a win\n\n1987\n\nMelbourne produces its finest season since its most premiership in 1964, when it reaches the finals for the first time in 23 years. The Demons record a stunning 15-point win in round 22 over Footscray at the Western (Whitten) Oval to secure fifth spot. It results in captain Robert Flower \u2013 who is talked out of retirement at the end of 1986 \u2013 playing his first finals series in his last VFL season. He skippers the side for a seventh season \u2013 then a club record. Melbourne plays and wins its first finals match since 1964, smashing North Melbourne by 118 points in the elimination final at the MCG \u2013 the equal fourth greatest winning margin in a VFL/AFL final. The Demons then easily account for the Sydney Swans by 76 points at the MCG, before it falls two points short in dramatic circumstances to Hawthorn in the preliminary final at Waverley Park. The late, great Jim Stynes, in his debut season, runs across the mark, giving Hawk Gary Buckenara a 15-metre penalty. Buckenara\u2019s kick after the siren ends Melbourne\u2019s dream and puts Hawthorn in the Grand Final. Coach John Northey is captured post-match giving Stynes a spray \u2013 an image captured by Wayne Ludbey and now part of football folklore. Melbourne secures Todd Viney, Earl Spalding and Warren Dean as interstate recruits, as the club returns to its dark blue colours, instead of the \u2018television\u2019 royal blue. Steven Stretch wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest award and Flower tops the goalkicking with 47 majors. The Demons also defeat Essendon by four points at Waverley Park to win the night series Grand Final. Tony King becomes general manager/CEO. At the season\u2019s end, Melbourne defeats Sydney Swans and North Melbourne in exhibition matches played in Vancouver, Canada.\n\n\n\nAfter the 1987 Panasonic Cup night series Premiership\n\n1988\n\nFor the first time since 1964, Melbourne makes the Grand Final, after winning 12 of its opening 16 matches. But it proves to be a shattering day for the Demons, as they lose to Hawthorn by a then record margin 96 points at the MCG. Melbourne starts its finals campaign with a thrilling two-point win over the West Coast Eagles in the elimination final at Waverley Park. The Demons then defeat Collingwood by 13 points in the first semi-final at the MCG. Melbourne then secures a Grand Final berth after beating Carlton by 22 points at Waverley Park. Greg Healy becomes captain and Steven O\u2019Dwyer wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest, but is ruled out of the Grand Final due to suspension. Ricky Jackson boots 43 majors to top the club\u2019s goalkicking. Steven Febey and Andy Lovell make their debut.\n\n\n\nJim Stynes and Sean Wight in the 1988 Grand Final parade down Bourke Street Mall\n\n1989\n\nMelbourne reaches the finals for the third consecutive year. The Demons defeat Collingwood by 23 points at Waverley Park, before going down to Geelong by 63 points in the first semi-final at the MCG. The Demons finish fourth. Melbourne wins its second night premiership in three years, when it beats Geelong by nine points at Waverley Park. Alan Johnson wins his second club best and fairest award and recruit Darren Bennett, who later becomes an NFL punter, kicks 34 goals.\n\n^ Back to top\n\nThe 1990s\n\n1990\n\nMelbourne records 16 wins \u2013 its equal best achievement in a home and away season. Although it must be noted that the Demons played 22 rounds, as opposed to 1956 when they won 16 of 18 rounds. For the fourth year in succession, Melbourne makes the finals. After defeating Hawthorn in the final home and away round, Melbourne again beats the Hawks by nine points in the elimination final at the MCG. Defenders Tony Campbell and Peter Rohde are pivotal in both weeks, keeping brilliant Hawthorn forwards Jason Dunstall and Dermott Brereton in check. The Demons are then knocked out of the finals by West Coast. The Eagles defeat Melbourne by 30 points in the first semi-final at Waverley Park. Garry Lyon wins the club\u2019s best and fairest award and Darren Bennett kicks 87 goals to top the club\u2019s goalkicking \u2013 the best effort since Fred Fanning\u2019s 97 goals in 1947. Melbourne wins the McClelland Trophy for the first time since 1958, after having the highest aggregate between seniors, reserves and under 19s. Rod Keogh wins his first of two Gardiner Medals, while future 2016 Western Bulldogs premiership coach Luke Beveridge comes second.\n\n1991\n\nFor the fifth year running, Melbourne makes the finals. Under new captain Garry Lyon, the Demons produce a stunning come-from-behind 38-point win over Essendon in the elimination final at Waverley Park. But Melbourne is knocked out again by West Coast. The Eagles defeat Melbourne by 38 points in the first semi-final at Waverley Park. Two players have stunning seasons for Melbourne. Jim Stynes wins the Brownlow Medal and every other major football award for the season. It\u2019s a remarkable achievement, given he\u2019s part of Melbourne\u2019s Irish experiment. Allen Jakovich bursts onto the scene, capturing the imagination of the football world. He quickly becomes a cult figure among the Melbourne faithful. He boots 71 goals in 14 matches, including 11.8 against North Melbourne in round 20 at the MCG. Melbourne equals its highest VFL/AFL score against the Kangaroos in round five, kicking 28.14 (182) at the MCG. It\u2019s the same score line achieved against the Roos in 1986.\n\n\n\n1991 Brownlow Medalist Jim Stynes\n\n1992\n\nAfter five consecutive seasons in the finals, Melbourne misses out for the first time since 1986. The Demons finish 11th with seven wins and one draw. At the season\u2019s end, John Northey announces his resignation, after 167 matches and 13 finals. Only Norm Smith and Frank \u2018Checker\u2019 Hughes have coached Melbourne to more finals than Northey. Ian Ridley becomes chairman and Hassa Mann becomes chief executive in July. Glenn Lovett wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest award and Allen Jakovich tops the goalkicking for the second year in a row with 40 majors.\n\n1993\n\nNeil Balme becomes coach, beating the likes of Denis Pagan for the position. The Demons finish 10th with 10 wins. Todd Viney wins the best and fairest and Allen Jakovich boots 39 majors to top Melbourne\u2019s goal tally. The great David Neitz makes his debut. Melbourne wins its 12th and last reserves premiership, before the competition is abolished at the end of the 1999 season. Rod Keogh wins his second Gardiner Medal.\n\n\n\nNeil Balme sings with the team after a win in 1993\n\n1994\n\nMelbourne produces its most successful season under Neil Balme. The class of \u201994 is regarded as one of Melbourne\u2019s best and most talented teams since its most recent premiership in 1964. The Demons finish the home and away season with 12 wins, placing seventh in the new final eight. In its first final, Melbourne upsets Carlton in the third qualifying final by 27 points at the MCG. The Demons then smash Footscray by 79 points in the first semi-final at the \u2018G. Garry Lyon boots 10 goals in a stunning display, as David Schwarz has a stunning finals series. Melbourne plays its first non-Victorian final against West Coast Eagles in the second preliminary final at the WACA. Despite possessing an impressive line-up, Melbourne is no match for the dominant West Coast, as the home side wins by 65 points. Not surprisingly, the Eagles win the flag comfortably by 80 points against Geelong. Allen Jakovich plays his final game for Melbourne, kicking eight goals against Hawthorn in round 17 at Princes Park. Lyon wins the club\u2019s best and fairest award and tops Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking with 79 majors.\n\n1995\n\nAfter a brilliant finals\u2019 campaign the previous year, David Schwarz suffers a serious knee injury in the pre-season. He remarkably returns in round nine, but the following week he suffers another knee injury, which ends his year. Melbourne slides out of the eight, finishing ninth with nine wins. Jim Stynes wins his second best and fairest for the club and Garry Lyon goes back-to-back in Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking with 77 majors. Shaun Smith takes what is later known as the \u2018mark of the century\u2019 against the Brisbane Bears in the final round of the home and away season at the Gabba. Melbourne opens its first social venue, Leighoak, in May.\n\n1996\n\nTodd Viney announces his retirement before the start of the season to take up a coaching position with Australian tennis player Mark Philippoussis. He is retained on the list just in case, which proves to be right move, as Viney is back playing in round two. David Schwarz injures his knee for a third time during a pre-season practice match. The Demons have a tough year, winning seven games and finishing 14th. Jim Stynes, who wins his third best and fairest, and second in a row, breaks the record for the most consecutive games played \u2013 previously held by Richmond\u2019s Jack Titus, who played 202 in succession from 1933-43. David Neitz tops the club goalkicking for the first time with 56 majors. After speculation surrounding Melbourne\u2019s future as a club, a press conference is held on the Monday after round 17, outlining the fact that the club is in talks with Hawthorn about a merger. The club would be known as the Melbourne Hawks. It comes on the back of the Fitzroy-Brisbane merger, which is announced earlier in the season. Coincidentally, Melbourne and Hawthorn meet in the final round of the home and away season. It\u2019s a thrilling contest, with Hawthorn prevailing by one-point at the MCG. Hawthorn great Jason Dunstall kicks 10 goals \u2013 and his 100th for the season \u2013 while David Neitz boots six and Jeff Farmer snares four. On September 16, a meeting is held to vote on Melbourne\u2019s future at the Dallas Brookes Hall. Once proxies are counted, Melbourne votes to merge with Hawthorn. But Hawthorn opts against the merger and it doesn\u2019t go ahead. Both clubs remain in the AFL as we know them today. Ian Ridley resigns as president in September, with Joseph Gutnick replacing him.\n\n1997\n\nAlthough Melbourne shocks the reigning premiers, North Melbourne, in the opening round of the season at the MCG, the club has a poor year, winning four matches and claiming the wooden spoon for the first time since 1981. After Melbourne\u2019s round nine loss to Port Adelaide at Football Park, Neil Balme is replaced as coach by Greg Hutchison, who takes over for the rest of the season. Hassa Mann also resigns as chief executive, with Cameron Schwab named his replacement. Melbourne also lands football manager Danny Corcoran late in the season and appoints the inspirational Neale Daniher as coach at the season\u2019s end. Daniher is named over Hutchison, Damian Drum and Peter Schwab. Jim Stynes equals Allan La Fontaine\u2019s club best and fairest record, when he wins his fourth Keith \u2018Bluey\u2019 Truscott Memorial Trophy. It\u2019s also Stynes\u2019 third club champion award in a row. Jeff Farmer and David Neitz kick 30 goals each to share the club goalkicking. The club opens its second social venue, the Bentleigh Club. Melbourne drafts Travis Johnstone with the No.1 AFL Draft pick late in the year, while the club also secures young ruckman Jeff White, former Saint Jamie Shanahan and ball-winner Guy Rigoni. Melbourne almost lures West Coast great Peter Matera, but he opts to remain at the Eagles.\n\n\n\nJim Stynes runs out for his 277th consecutive game in 1997\n\n1998\n\nIn Neale Daniher\u2019s first year as coach, Melbourne produces a stunning year, rising 12 places from 16th to fourth. The Demons win 14 games in the home and away season, before defeating eventual premier Adelaide by 48 points in the first qualifying final at the MCG. The Demons then defeat St Kilda by 51 points in the first semi-final at the \u2018G. Coming up against the Kangaroos in the second preliminary final at the MCG, Melbourne falls to the Roos by 30 points. Todd Viney becomes captain, replacing Garry Lyon, who steps down after holding the position since 1991. Jim Stynes\u2019 remarkable run of consecutive matches comes to an end, when he breaks a hand against Carlton at Princes Park in round four. Stynes plays 244 games in a row, which remains a VFL/AFL record today. Brett Lovett retires during the season and at the club\u2019s best and fairest count on October 3, Stynes announces his retirement. He retires as one of the greats of the game. Viney wins his second best and fairest award and Jeff Farmer tops the club\u2019s goalkicking for a second time with 47 majors. Farmer also produces a stunning leap to pull in a brilliant mark against Richmond in the final round at the MCG.\n\n1999\n\nMelbourne endures a disappointing year \u2013 on and off the field. The Demons slide down the ladder, finishing 14th with six wins. Club great Garry Lyon retires mid-season. Chief executive Cameron Schwab resigns in August, with John Anderson his replacement. David Schwarz wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest award \u2013 a fine achievement given he overcomes three knee reconstructions. David Neitz kicks 46 majors to lead the club\u2019s goal scoring for the third time. Club great Todd Viney retires.\n\n\n\nClub captain Todd Viney runs out for his last game in 1999 holding son Max and with another future captain, Jack by his side\n\n^ Back to top\n\nThe 2000s\n\n2000\n\nAfter a frustrating season, Melbourne rises again, making just its second Grand Final since its most recent premiership in 1964. For the record, it\u2019s also the 18th Grand Final Melbourne plays in (12 wins, one draw and five losses). David Neitz is appointed skipper and he ends up captaining Melbourne in 175 games \u2013 a club record. The Demons win 10 of their final 12 games for the season, but run into Essendon \u2013 which loses just one match from its 25 matches for the season. Not surprisingly, Melbourne goes down to Essendon by 65 points at the \u2018G on Grand Final day. Statistically, the Bombers produce the greatest individual season in VFL/AFL history. Unfortunately for Melbourne, the Demons run into two of the greatest teams of all-time in their only two Grand Finals since 1964, with Hawthorn losing just three matches in 1988. Melbourne starts its finals campaign with a nine-point win over Carlton in the second qualifying final at the MCG, and follows up with a second preliminary final victory over the Kangaroos by 50 points at the \u2018G. Shane Woedwodin caps off his finest AFL season, winning the Brownlow Medal and the club\u2019s best and fairest. He becomes the sixth person, and the seventh Brownlow Medal winner for Melbourne. Jim Stynes (1991) and Woewodin are the only two Melbourne players to win the Brownlow Medal and club best and fairest in the same season. Woewodin is also Melbourne\u2019s most recent winner. For the third time, Jeff Farmer tops Melbourne\u2019s goal tally with 76. Brad Green, Cameron Bruce and Matthew Whelan are among Melbourne debutants.\n\n\n\nDavid Neitz and James Hird with the cup prior to the 2000 Grand Final\n\n2001\n\nOn the back of a Grand Final year, Melbourne slips out of the eight, finishing 11th with 10 wins. Off-field, Joseph Gutnick resigns as president in May, with Gabriel Szondy his replacement. Adem Yze, one of Melbourne\u2019s best and most consistent players in the Neale Daniher era, wins the best and fairest. Russell Robertson leads Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking with 42.\n\n2002\n\nMelbourne returns to the finals \u2013 finishing sixth \u2013 playing the Kangaroos in the second elimination final. The Demons defeat the Roos by 38 points at the MCG, before falling to Adelaide in the second semi-final at the \u2018G. Melbourne\u2019s clash against the Crows is a remarkable match. After the Crows lead by 40 points at the first change, Melbourne not only regains the lead, but hits the front by 22 points at three quarter-time. But Adelaide hits back in the final term and wins by 12 points, ending Melbourne\u2019s season. Melbourne wins a thrilling round 14 clash against the Brisbane Lions by 21 points \u2013 then a powerhouse of the competition. The Lions had won their past 18 in a row at the Gabba, when Melbourne notches up a victory in a \u2018home\u2019 Queensland game. Captain David Neitz has a brilliant season, winning the club\u2019s first Coleman Medal. He finishes the year with 82 goals and claims his first and \u2013 surprisingly \u2013 only best and fairest win. Neitz is Melbourne\u2019s first VFL/AFL leading goalkicker since Fred Fanning in 1947. Adem Yze finishes equal third in the Brownlow Medal. David Schwarz retires during the season, Steven Febey calls time at season\u2019s end and Shane Woewodin is stunningly traded to Collingwood in October. S.Febey, Steven Armstong and David Robbins are caught up in the Bali Bombings at the end of the season. John Anderson resigns as chief executive in October, with Peter Cox named interim CEO.\n\n2003\n\nThe rollercoaster ride continues in the Neale Daniher era, as Melbourne falls to 14th on the ladder with just five wins. Ray Ellis becomes chief executive and Gabriel Szondy resigns as president in August. Paul Gardner becomes CEO. David Neitz leads the club goalkicking for the second year in a row \u2013 and for the fifth time in his career. He boots 65 goals. Russell Robertson wins the club\u2019s best and fairest award.\n\n2004\n\nMelbourne bounces back into the finals, finishing fifth at the end of the home and away season with 14 wins. The red and blue sits on top of the ladder after round 18, but fails to win one of its final five matches. The Demons take on Essendon in the first elimination final, but falls five points short at the MCG. John Phillips becomes acting chief executive, before Steve Harris is appointed CEO. Jared Rivers wins Melbourne\u2019s first NAB AFL Rising Star Award. David Neitz kicks 69 goals \u2013 leading the club\u2019s goal scoring for the third consecutive season. It\u2019s also the sixth time in his career he tops the club\u2019s goal tally. Jeff White wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest. In December, the club signs an agreement with the Melbourne and Olympic Park Trust, with the aim to create an elite training and administration base at the redeveloped venue. Tragically, Troy Broadbridge loses his life during Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami on December 26.\n\n2005\n\nMelbourne opens its season against Essendon at the MCG, with a tribute game for the late Troy Broadbridge. It\u2019s an emotional event for all involved. The Demons win by 46 points. Melbourne wins nine of its opening 12 matches, before losing six in a row. The Dees bounce back with three successive victories, starting with one of its greatest wins of the modern era \u2013 its first over Geelong at Kardinia Park since 1988. Russell Robertson, who leads the club\u2019s goalkicking for the second time with 73 goals, stars with a career-best seven goals in its round 20 win. The Demons take on the Cats three weeks later, in the second elimination final at the MCG, but goes down by 55 points. Melbourne finishes seventh after the home and away season with 12 wins and eighth following the finals series. Travis Johnstone wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest.\n\n2006\n\nMelbourne makes the finals for the third year in a row \u2013 and it proves to be the club\u2019s most recent finals appearance. For more than 10 years, the Demons fail to make the eight. It\u2019s the end of an era, after Melbourne plays in 12 finals series from 20 seasons (1987-2006) under John Northey, Neil Balme and Neale Daniher. The Demons start the season with three losses, before winning 11 of their next 12 matches. By the end of the home and away season, Melbourne finishes seventh with 13 wins. At the end of the finals series, Melbourne comes fifth. It plays St Kilda in the second elimination final, winning by 18 points at the MCG. The Demons then head to Perth, taking on Fremantle in the second semi-final at Subiaco Oval. But the Dockers prevail by 28 points, ending Melbourne\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s the most recent finals match Melbourne plays in. David Neitz leads Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking for the seventh and final time. He boots 68 majors. James McDonald wins his first best and fairest award. Future captain Nathan Jones makes his debut.\n\n\n\nDavid Neitz takes a kick during the 2006 Elimination Final against St Kilda\n\n2007\n\nFinishing the 2006 as the highest ranked Victorian team, there is genuine expectation around Melbourne, but it\u2019s the start of a disappointing era. The Demons finish 14th with five wins. James McDonald wins back-to-back best and fairest awards, while Russell Robertson leads the club\u2019s goalkicking for the third time. He boots 42 majors. Neale Daniher coaches Melbourne for the last time after departing mid-season. He guides Melbourne in 223 games, with only Norm Smith (307) and Frank \u2018Checker\u2019 Hughes (258) coaching the club more. Mark Riley takes over as caretaker coach against Carlton in round 14 at the MCG. He coaches Melbourne for the final nine games, before he\u2019s in the mix for the senior coaching position at the end of the season. Four-time Essendon premiership coach Kevin Sheedy, future 2017 Richmond premiership coach Damien Hardwick, former Fremantle coach and former Demon player Chris Connolly, and ex-Essendon player and Port Adelaide assistant coach, the late Dean Bailey, a member of the Power\u2019s 2004 premiership coaching staff, are the other contenders. In the end, Bailey gets the nod. Michael Newton wins the mark of the year for his grab against the Kangaroos in round 16 at Docklands. In round 20, against Collingwood at the MCG, David Neitz becomes the first \u2013 and still only \u2013 player to play 300 games for Melbourne. West Coast superstar Chris Judd, who barracks for the Demons growing up, nominates Melbourne as possible candidate, upon his return to Victoria. But he opts for Carlton.\n\n2008\n\nMelbourne celebrates 150 years as a club. In his first season as coach, Dean Bailey experiences a couple of massive losses in the opening two rounds, by a combined losing margin of 199 points. Melbourne plays reigning premiers Geelong in round three at Kardinia Park and enters the game massive outsiders. Yet the Demons kick the opening three goals, before losing by a respectable 23 points. The red and blue wins its first game under Bailey in round seven, when the Demons produce a remarkable comeback \u2013 they trail by 51 points at the 23-minute mark of the second quarter \u2013 to overcome Fremantle by seven points at the MCG. In just his fifth AFL game, Austin Wonaeamirri boots three of his four goals to help Melbourne to a stunning win. Melbourne\u2019s second win under Bailey is a one-point thriller against the Brisbane Lions in round 14 at the \u2018G. The Demons record their third and final win of the season against West Coast Eagles by 34 points in round 20 at the MCG. The club claims the wooden spoon. On May 19, one of Melbourne\u2019s greatest players, David Neitz announces his retirement, after a club record 306 games. He finishes having captained the most games for Melbourne (175) and having booted the most goals for the club (631). Early in the year, Steve Harris finishes as chief executive. Former tennis player Paul McNamee becomes CEO, but his tenure is short-lived and he is replaced by interim CEO, Peter Spargo. On August 26, Cameron Schwab returns to the club as chief executive. It\u2019s his third stint at the club, and second as CEO. Paul Gardner announces his resignation in June, with the late, great Jim Stynes replacing him as president. Stynes immediately gets to work and is instrumental in Melbourne\u2019s \u2018Debt Demolition\u2019 campaign held in a Kensington warehouse on August 5. More than $1.3 million is raised on the night, with more than $3 million pledged to the cause. Jeff White and Adem Yze finish at the end of the season, while Jack Watts is selected with Melbourne\u2019s No.1 pick at the NAB AFL Draft.\n\n2009\n\nMelbourne endures another poor season, winning four matches \u2013 one more than 2008 \u2013 to claim back-to-back wooden spoons. Its Melbourne\u2019s 12th and most recent bottom of the ladder finish. James McDonald takes over as captain, while Aaron Davey, who signs a four-year contract at the end of the season, wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest. Star forward Russell Robertson, in his final season, leads the club\u2019s goalkicking for the fourth time with 29 majors. Liam Jurrah debuts for Melbourne. In July, Jim Stynes reveals he is fighting cancer. He temporarily steps down, with vice-chairman Don McLardy stepping up in his absence. In November, Melbourne selects Tom Scully with its No.1 selection in the NAB AFL Draft.\n\n^ Back to top\n\nThe 2010s\n\n2010\n\nThe Demons start to show genuine improvement, when they win three in a row from rounds three to five. By round 19, Melbourne has eight victories, one draw and 10 losses. Finals are not out of the equation, but it needs several results to fall its way. In the end, Melbourne fails to add any more wins. Still, there are some impressive wins throughout the year, including a 73-point victory over Sydney at the MCG \u2013 future Melbourne coach Paul Roos\u2019 heaviest loss as coach of the Swans. By the season\u2019s end, the Demons finish 12th. Brad Green has a fine year, winning the club\u2019s best and fairest and booting 55 goals to lead Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking. It\u2019s the most majors in a season by a Melbourne player since David Neitz\u2019s 68 in 2006. James McDonald finishes at the end of the year. In round 21, Liam Jurrah takes the mark of the year against Port Adelaide at Football Park.\n\n\n\nPresident Jim Stynes with club captain Brad Green after a game in Darwin in 2010\n\n\n\n2011\n\nMelbourne is on a similar path to 2010, but it takes a dramatic turn when it plays Geelong at Kardinia Park in round 19. The Demons suffer the second greatest loss in VFL/AFL history \u2013 Melbourne also holds the unfortunate record for the heaviest league defeat, when Fitzroy trounced the Demons by 190 points at Waverley Park in round 17, 1979 \u2013 after being demolished by 186 points, resulting in the departure of coach Dean Bailey. It\u2019s a remarkable fall, given Melbourne is eighth on the ladder after round 14 and still in finals contention after round 17, sitting ninth. After the departure of Bailey, former captain Todd Viney takes over as coach for the rest of the season. He gains one win from five matches against the Gold Coast Suns at the MCG in round 23. The Demons finish with the same wins (eight), draws (one) and losses (13) as 2010, but finishes one rung lower on the ladder, in 13th position. Brad Green is named captain, Brent Moloney wins the best and fairest and Liam Jurrah tops the club\u2019s goalkicking with 40 majors. Max Gawn makes his debut. Sadly, on June 30, former player Sean Wight passes away, aged 47. In September, former Geelong and Richmond player, and Collingwood assistant coach, Mark Neeld is named coach.\n\n2012\n\nMark Neeld endures an incredibly tough first year as coach. Melbourne wins just four matches for the year and drops further down the ladder to 16th. Due to his health, Jim Stynes retires as president, with vice-president Don McLardy stepping up to take the reins. Tragically, on March 20, Stynes\u2019 long fight with cancer comes to an end. He is given a state funeral, given his remarkable legacy on and off the field. Brad Green, who retires at season\u2019s end, is replaced as captain by joint skippers: Jack Grimes and Jack Trengove, who becomes the youngest full-time skipper in VFL/AFL history at 20 years, 217 days. Although it must be noted that Bernie Quinlan was 20 years and nine days when he led Footscray in round 18, 1971. Nathan Jones wins his first club best and fairest award and Mitch Clark tops the goalkicking with 29 majors. Jeremy Howe rakes in the mark of the year against Sydney Swans in round eight at the SCG. Several off-field incidents cloud the club. The AFL investigates Melbourne\u2019s 2009 season in August, following comments made by former Demon and Carlton player, Brock McLean that the club had not been trying to win. The Demons recruit several players with AFL experience at the end of the 2012 season, including Chris Dawes, Cam Pedersen and David Rodan. Future star Jesse Hogan is also signed as a 17-year-old.\n\n2013\n\nMelbourne endures one of its worst VFL/AFL seasons, when it wins just two games. Not since 1981, when Melbourne won one game, has the club endured such a poor season. The Demons register their worst percentage since 1906. It\u2019s a tumultuous year on and off the field. In February, after an exhaustive seven-month inquiry, it\u2019s deemed Melbourne was not guilty of losing games deliberately in the 2009 season, but that former coach Dean Bailey and general manager of football operations Chris Connolly had acted improperly in 2009. Bailey (now at Adelaide, as part of the club\u2019s coaching panel) and Connolly are suspended and the club is fined $500,000. After round three, on April 9, chief executive Cameron Schwab is asked to resign by president Don McLardy. Peter Spargo becomes interim CEO from April 9 to 31, before former Essendon chief executive Peter Jackson is appointed chief executive on May 1. He becomes permanent CEO from June 3. From June 14 to August 16, Peter Spargo becomes interim president, after McLardy resigns. On August 16, the club appoints former West Coast player Glen Bartlett as its chairman. Bartlett and Jackson remain in those roles today, although the latter will retire at the end of the 2018 season, to be replaced by former Fitzroy and Collingwood star, and long-serving Magpies CEO, Gary Pert. Coach Mark Neeld is sacked during Melbourne\u2019s mid-season bye, with former Adelaide coach Neil Craig taking over for the rest of the season from round 13. Melbourne\u2019s first win of the season \u2013 against Greater Western Sydney in round four at the MCG \u2013 sees the club record its highest scoring quarter in VFL/AFL history. The Demons boot 12.2 (74) to record a 41-point victory \u2013 after trailing by 19 points at three quarter-time. Melbourne\u2019s first women\u2019s team plays an exhibition match against the Western Bulldogs, as a curtain-raiser to the men\u2019s match between the same teams in round 14. Melbourne drafts superstar Daisy Pearce with the first pick in the draft. Nathan Jones goes back-to-back in Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest, and Jeremy Howe tops the club goalkicking with 28 majors. Future co-captain Jack Viney, the son of former skipper Todd, makes his debut. Star Demon Aaron Davey retires. On September 6, Melbourne lures former Fitzroy and Sydney great, and 2005 Swans premiership coach, Paul Roos as coach. The club signs him to a two-year deal with an option for a third. Roos commits to the cause, but says he wants to unearth his successor during his time at the club.\n\n2014\n\nAfter Melbourne comes off a miserable season, Paul Roos, in his first year as coach, guides the club to four wins. Although it\u2019s only two more victories than 2013, the Demons improve their percentage, while they start the season better, winning their four games in the opening 12 matches. Still, it\u2019s a disappointing end to the season, as Melbourne loses its last 10 matches to finish 17th. The Demons produce a stunning three-point win over the Crows at Adelaide Oval in round seven \u2013 their first win in South Australia since 2001. Jack Grimes remains co-captain, but is joined by Nathan Jones, after Jack Trengove step down. On April 8, Mitch Clark retires, due to clinical depression. He later resumes his career with Geelong in 2015-16. Jones wins his third consecutive best and fairest. Chris Dawes kicks 20 goals to lead Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking. Sadly, on March 11, former coach Dean Bailey passes away, aged 47. Club great Robert Flower also sadly passes away, aged 59 on October 2.\n\n2015\n\nMelbourne makes improvement in coach Paul Roos\u2019 second year, winning seven matches to place 13th. It\u2019s the club\u2019s best season since 2011. Nathan Jones becomes sole captain, with Jack Grimes no longer in the position. Christian Petracca, the club\u2019s No.2 selection in the 2014 NAB AFL Draft, injures his knee in the pre-season and misses the year. Jack Trengove is also sidelined for the entire with a debilitating foot injury. The Demons win their first round one encounter since 2005, when they defeat Gold Coast Suns by 26 points at the MCG. The Dees also achieve their first win against Geelong since 2006 \u2013 and their first at Kardinia Park since 2005. It\u2019s an outstanding 24-point win in round 12. Melbourne also defeats Collingwood by 37 points in round 18 \u2013 its first win over the Magpies since round 11, 2007. And Melbourne ends a 22-game losing streak at Docklands \u2013 dating back to round 19, 2007, when Mark Riley was caretaker coach \u2013 after it defeats Greater Western Sydney by 26 points in the final round of the season. Bernie Vince wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest and Jesse Hogan tops the goalkicking with 44 majors. It\u2019s a fine season by Hogan, who makes his AFL debut and wins the club\u2019s second NAB AFL Rising Star. Melbourne\u2019s women\u2019s team plays the Western Bulldogs twice, notching up two wins. On September 18, Melbourne names Simon Goodwin as Paul Roos\u2019 successor. The Adelaide signs a five-year deal, with his first seasons as Roos\u2019 assistant, before he takes over as senior coach for the 2017 season.\n\n\n\nNathan Jones, Ron Barassi and Paul Roos prior to the 2015 season\n\n2016\n\nIn Paul Roos\u2019 final season as Melbourne coach, the club continues to rise up the ladder and even pushes for the finals. The Demons win 10 matches \u2013 the club\u2019s best result since Neale Daniher\u2019s last full season as coach in 2006 \u2013 to finish 11th. Melbourne wins three in a row from rounds 19 to 21 \u2013 the first time it claims a hat-trick of victories since rounds 17 to 19, 2010. Its win over Hawthorn by 29 points at the MCG in round 20 ends a 13-game losing streak against the Hawks, dating back to round eight, 2006. Melbourne also records an outstanding 40-point win over Port Adelaide at Adelaide Oval, ending a seven-match losing streak against the Power. It\u2019s also the red and blue\u2019s first victory over Port Adelaide in South Australia since round eight, 2000. But when it falls to Carlton by 20 points at the MCG in its second last home and away match for the season, Melbourne is out of the finals race. Jack Viney wins Melbourne\u2019s best and fairest award. Given his dad Todd wins the award in 1993 and 1998, they become the first father/son duo to win Melbourne\u2019s Keith \u2018Bluey\u2019 Truscott Memorial Trophy. Jesse Hogan tops Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking for the second successive season with 41 goals. At the end of the season, Roos passes the coaching baton to Simon Goodwin. In the off-season, Melbourne secures four-time Hawthorn premiership player Jordan Lewis and former Bomber Michael Hibberd. Clayton Oliver debuts for Melbourne. On September 28, former player and Australian Test cricketer Max Walker passes away, aged 68.\n\n2017\n\nThe Demons make history in 2017, competing as one of the eight foundation clubs in the inaugural AFL Women's competition. Led by skipper Daisy Pearce and coach Mick Stinear, Melbourne took on the Brisbane Lions in the first game of the new league at Casey Fields. In wild weather at Casey, Melbourne's first ever AFLW goal was booted by Jasmine Grierson, however it was the only major of the game for the red and blue, with Brisbane winning by 15 points. However the Demons would steady to win five of their next six in the inaugural season, missing the Grand Final on percentage. Their only other loss of the campaign came against eventual Premiers Adelaide. Daisy Pearce takes out the AFLW Best and Fairest Award, while also being named as the All-Australian captain. Elise O'Dea and Karen Paxman also make the team.\n\nIn the AFL, new coach Simon Goodwin leads Melbourne to it's best season since 2006 \u2013 even though the season ends in heartbreak. The Demons win 12 matches \u2013 and sit inside the top eight after 15 rounds \u2013 but agonisingly misses the top eight by 0.5 per cent. After losing its final match of the home and away season to Collingwood by 16 points at the MCG, Melbourne must wait until the following day to find out its finals fate. It comes down to the final home and away game of the season between West Coast Eagles and Adelaide Crows at Subiaco. Entering time-on in the final quarter, Melbourne is in the eight. But when West Coast kicks the final two goals, it gives the Eagles a percentage of 105.71, which pips the Demons\u2019 105.22 and ends their season. It was a disappointing end to another improved season since Melbourne\u2019s two-win season in 2013. Melbourne opens its season with a 30-point win over St Kilda at Etihad Stadium. It\u2019s the red and blue\u2019s first win over the Saints since its most recent finals win in the 2006 second elimination final. It ends a 14-game losing streak against the Saints. The Demons win four in succession \u2013 their best winning streak since rounds 10 to 15, 2006 \u2013 from rounds 10 to 14. This includes their first win at Traeger Park in Alice Springs, when the Demons defeat the Gold Coast Suns by 35 points in round 10. Melbourne also produces a brilliant three-point win over West Coast Eagles at Subiaco in round 14. Tom McDonald\u2019s fifth goal \u2013 kicked over his head \u2013 in the dying stages gives Melbourne its first win over West Coast at Subiaco since round 19, 2002. The Demons appoint co-captains, with Jack Viney joining Nathan Jones in the role. In just his second season, Clayton Oliver has a stunning year, winning the Best and Fairest. Jeff Garlett tops Melbourne\u2019s goalkicking with 42 majors. Michael Hibberd debuts for Melbourne and has a fine first-up season, claiming All-Australian selection. In the off-season, Melbourne secures outstanding young defender, Jake Lever, from Adelaide.\n\n2018\n\nAfter a third-place finish in 2018, Melbourne enters the second AFLW season with optimism high. The Dees open their season with a win against GWS and win four out of six heading into the final round. In a virtual Preliminary Final, Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs meet in the final round, with the victor guaranteed a Grand Final spot. The margin stays close throughout the match, with the lead swapping several times. However it would end in heartbreak for the Dees, with a goal from Bulldog Brooke Lochland inside the last two minutes ensuring a two-point win for the Dogs. Daisy Pearce claims her second Best and Fairest and is again named All-Australian captain. Elise O'Dea and Karen Paxman earn second call-ups, with Meg Downie also being named in the team.\n\nGiven Melbourne\u2019s improvement each season in the Paul Roos/Simon Goodwin era, the Demons enter 2018 with much expectation. Melbourne wins eight of its opening 11 matches, including six in a row from rounds six to 11 \u2013 its best winning streak since 2006. During this period, Melbourne defeats Carlton by 109 points in round nine at the MCG and Adelaide Crows by 91 points in round 10 at Trager Park, Alice Springs. From rounds nine to 11, Melbourne sits third on the ladder \u2013 again, something it hasn\u2019t achieved since 2006. But the Demons drop three in succession from rounds 12 to 15 (it has the bye in round 13), before bouncing back with a 54-point win over Fremantle at TIO Stadium (Marrara Oval) in Darwin. The win in Darwin sees the Demons steady in the run home, claiming wins against the Western Bulldogs (R17), Adelaide (R19) and Gold Coast (R20), however they lose games to top-eight opponents in Geelong (R18) and Sydney (R21). With two weeks left in the season, Melbourne travels to the new Optus Stadium in Perth for the first time, needing a win over the Eagles to lock in a finals spot. Melbourne lead throughout the first three quarters in a close game, however the Eagles take the lead with 10 minutes to go. Melbourne levels, kicking the last three - two off the boot of Jake Melksham - to record a memorable win in the west and lock in a top-eight spot for the first time since 2006. Melbourne see off the GWS Giants in Round 23 to lock in a home final at the MCG.\n\nMelbourne are drawn to play the Cats in the First Elimination Final at the MCG. The two regular season Melbourne-Geelong matches had gone down to the wire, with the Cats winning both by a combined five points. Welcoming skipper Jack Viney back into the side, an aggressive Melbourne side shows up on a Friday night in front of more than 90,000 fans. The Demons blitz the Cats, winning by 29 points. In a symbolic moment, Nathan Jones boots the sealer, after going 12 years without playing a final. Melbourne draws Hawthorn in Week Two of the Finals and again get a chance on the Friday night stage in front of more than 90,000 at the MCG. Entering the match unchanged, the Demons again enter the match breathing fire and out body Hawthorn throughout. Melbourne led throughout the game and snuffed out a late Hawks charge to book their first Preliminary Final appearance since 2000. They would be scheduled to again go to Optus Stadium to play West Coast and enter the game confident after their Round 22 win at the venue. However, West Coast dominates the match with Melbourne kept goalless in the first half. The Eagles would win by 66 points and go on to win the Premiership the following week. In the Brownlow count the following Monday, Angus Brayshaw surprises many by finishing third in the count. To finish off the season, Max Gawn wins his first Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Memorial Trophy.\n\nThe Demons bring in three players during the Trade Period - Gold Coast's Steven May and Kade Kolodjashnij and North ruckman Braydon Preuss.\n\nOff the field, chief executive Peter Jackson announces he will retire at the end of his current term on October 31, with former Collingwood and Fitzroy star Gary Pert named to take over in 2019. On June 22, four-time premiership player Geoff Case passes away. On July 9, Melbourne turns 160 years old \u2013 remaining the oldest football club in the AFL and believed to be the world.\n\nNathan Jones celebrates a goal in the Elimination Final win over Geelong (Photo: Michael Willson)\n\n2019\n\nTwo new sides - Geelong and North Melbourne - enter the AFLW, with a new conference system adopted for the 2019 season. Melbourne is placed in Conference A alongside Adelaide, Fremantle, North Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs. With Daisy Pearce due to give birth to twins, Elise O'Dea and Shelley Scott take over captaincy duties for the season. In the tougher Conference A, Melbourne finish the year in fourth with a 4-3 record. The quirks of the system mean that if placed in Conference B, Melbourne would have finished on top of that group. Karen Paxman is awarded the Best and Fairest.\n\nThe AFL side enters 2019 as one of the Premiership favourites after a strong finals campaign the previous year. However with many Demons feeling the effects of a shortened pre-season due to off-season surgeries, 2019 doesn't go to plan. Melbourne lose five of their first six games, before finding some spark in Round 7 and 8 wins. The Demons struggle to pull together four quarters across the year and finish the season in a disappointing 17th place. Max Gawn and Clayton Oliver share the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Memorial Trophy, becoming the first joint winners.\n\nIn response to the poor finish, Melbourne adds respected fitness boss Darren Burgess and former Saints coach Alan Richardson to the football department.\n\nEd Langdon (Fremantle) and Adam Tomlinson (GWS Giants) are traded into the side, while Luke Jackson (Pick No.3), Kysaiah Pickett (Pick No.12) and Trent Rivers (Pick No.32) are drafted. Mitch Brown (Essendon) and Harley Bennell (Fremantle) are also added to the side as off-season recruits.\n\n^ Back to top\n\nThe 2020s\n\n2020\n\nIn a year that will go down in history, global events impact the game like never before. On-field, 2020 would begin fairly normally with Melbourne placed in Conference B of the AFLW competition, as the league welcomed Gold Coast, Richmond, St Kilda and West Coast into the fold. Melbourne again open the season with a win at Casey Fields, in nail-biting fashion against North Melbourne. After a summer where devastating bushfires impacted the country, the AFLW side is involved in a Bushfire Relief Double-Header at Marvel Stadium in Round 4 against Collingwood. The Demons would win by 20 points, however footy took a back seat as funds were raised for bushfire affected communities. Neville Jetta would take part in the second game of the night, playing for the All-Stars against Victoria. Round 5 of the season saw Melbourne claim a thumping 59-point win over newcomers West Coast at Casey Fields.\n\nIn March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit Australia. Mass gatherings would be restricted, with the league forced to play all AFL and AFLW games behind closed doors. Melbourne travels to Alice Springs to play Carlton in Round 6, winning in front of an empty ground. In the next few days, the AFL cuts the AFLW home and away season short, bringing forward the Finals which Melbourne qualify for after finishing third in Conference B. They travel to Giants Stadium to play GWS and record a famous win in their first-ever final. Trailing in the final term, the Dees kick the last three majors, with Lily Mithen sealing the match with minutes on the clock. Melbourne were scheduled to play Fremantle in a Preliminary Final in Perth, however the pandemic severely crippled travel across state borders and the AFL are forced to cancel the 2020 AFLW Season with no Premiership awarded. In an online event, Shelley Scott wins the Best and Fairest.\n\nThe pandemic also took it's toll on the AFL season, leading to one of the more unique seasons in recent memory. Under new captain Max Gawn, Melbourne travels to Perth in Round One, taking on the Eagles at an empty Optus Stadium. Just before the bounce, AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan announces the suspension of the season indefinitely. The Eagles take the win at home, with footy then going into hibernation following the match. The pandemic forces all training from March to May to occur away from the club in small groups. However Australia initially appears to have curbed the impact of the virus and in May, it is announced that footy will return with shortened matches and sixteen further rounds to be played allowing all teams to play each other once. On June 13, Melbourne returns to the field at Marvel Stadium in Round 2 as they claim a close win over Carlton. In Round 3, Melbourne's match against Essendon is postponed, following Bomber Conor McKenna testing positive to COVID-19 (later found to be a false test). However the season continues, with Melbourne initially based at Casey Fields during the restart and able to play in Victoria.\n\nAs Victoria's COVID-19 cases rise and restrictions are reinstated around physical contact, the AFL is forced to relocate all clubs and fixtures out of the state. Melbourne is initially moved to Sydney, where they would defeat Hawthorn and Gold Coast at Giants Stadium. Soon, Sydney is also declared a COVID-19 hotspot and the Demons make Maroochydore their home, as fourteen clubs relocate to the Sunshine State. The Demons go on to host games in Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Adelaide and Cairns, while playing in unique fixture slots like Wednesday nights. On-field, the Demons show much improvement from their disappointing 2019 season and record nine wins and eight losses in total. Looking likely to return to the finals, it was a trip to Cairns for two games that saw Melbourne's season come undone. They are defeated by unfancied sides in Sydney and Fremantle in consecutive matches and drop out of the eight. Melbourne would win their last two matches of 2020, however it is not enough as they finish ninth. Christian Petracca is awarded for a promising season, winning the Keith 'Bluey' Truscott Memorial Trophy. Petracca would go on to finish third in the Brownlow Medal count and earn All Australian selection, alongside Max Gawn.\n\nThe MCG would not hold a fan at any game in 2020 (Photo: Quinn Rooney)\n\n2021\n\nIf 2020 was unique, 2021 is the unknown. Some normality is restored over the summer, with the fifth AFLW season beginning in late January. The conference system, which had been adopted for the past two seasons, is no longer and Melbourne opens its season on the road against Gold Coast. The new normal sees the team fly up and back on the same day, to minimise COVID-19 risk, and secure a 21-point victory along the way. Fixture changes begin as early as Round 2, with lockdowns and quarantine requirements causing headaches across the league, and teams urged to remain adaptable. Melbourne's Round 3 game against North Melbourne is played in front of no crowd.\n\nThe Demons continue their strong form and book a spot in the Preliminary Final, having finished fourth on the home-and-away ladder and defeating Fremantle in a Qualifying Final at Casey Fields. An unrelenting Adelaide side, unfortunately, brings to a close their 2021 campaign the following week, beaten by 18 points at Adelaide Oval. Tyla Hanks wins the competition's Rising Star Award and shares the club's Best and Fairest Award with Karen Paxman.\n\nMelbourne's AFL campaign begins in March with an opening-round victory over Fremantle at the MCG. The Demons go on to win nine straight and their performances soon become the talk of the town. Many begin to draw comparisons to years gone by - it was Melbourne's best start to the season since 1956. COVID soon begins to rear its head in Victoria once again, forcing the Demons' highly-anticipated Round 11 match against the Western Bulldogs to be played behind closed doors. Melbourne wins that game, and the next against Brisbane, but falls short to Collingwood in Round 13. The two clubs are forced to play the match at the SCG, where a crowd can support FightMND's Big Freeze, while 'sliders' hit the ice in an eerie MCG event. Crowd restrictions and lockdowns continue to keep Melbourne fans at home as the season progresses, but that doesn't dampen their excitement as results continue to go the Demons' way. Round 23 becomes a game to remember. After trailing by 44 points midway through the third quarter against Geelong, Melbourne captain Max Gawn seals an almighty comeback, kicking a goal after the siren at GMHBA Stadium. In doing so, he secures the minor premiership for the first time since 1964.\n\nThe AFL confirms that the finals series will be played outside of Victoria, to allow fans to attend. Adelaide Oval is Melbourne's first stop, where a 33-point win over Brisbane advances the Demons through to a Preliminary Final. They then head west, setting up camp at Joondalup Resort in what becomes their home away from home. The excitement continues to build as Melbourne again meet Geelong. This time, it is easier on the faint-hearted, as the Dees defeat the Cats by 83 points at Optus Stadium and secure a place on the last Saturday in September. Fourteen days later, Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs do battle. The game is tight from the outset, but the Bulldogs get the upper hand after half time, taking their lead to 19 points midway through the third quarter. Now comes what is possibly the greatest 17 minutes in the club's history. Goals to Bayley Fritsch (two of six for the night), Ben Brown, Angus Brayshaw, Christian Petracca, Tom Sparrow and Clayton Oliver flip the Grand Final on its head, as the Demons take a 24-point lead into the final break. The flurry of goals continues in the fourth quarter and Melbourne secures its first premiership since 1964, ending a 57-year drought. Optus Stadium is electric, red and blue filling its stands. Christian Petracca is awarded the Norm Smith Medal and former player Garry Lyon presents the premiership cup to coach Simon Goodwin and captain Max Gawn.\n\n^ Back to top"}]}
