Tadeusz Szeligowski was born in 1896 in the city of Lw\u00f3w (or Lvov), which at that time was under the control of Austria. Although he received a doctorate in law, he also had a well-rounded musical education in Lw\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w, and (later) in Paris with Nadia Boulanger and Paul Dukas. Paris between the two world wars had a decisive effect on him, and when he returned to Poland in 1931, he gave up law in order to devote himself entirely to music \u2013 teaching, composing, and conducting. He was among the original founders of the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic, and served as its first music director between 1947 and 1949. Between 1950 and his death in 1963, he was a leading musical figure in Pozna\u0144, teaching at that city's conservatory and organizing major musical events.\n\nThis composer is not entirely new to CD \u2013 there's flute sonata out there, and a wind quintet \u2013 but all five of the works on this new Naxos CD are receiving their first commercial recordings here. The Comedy Overture (1952), which starts things off, isn't literally a curtain-raiser. It's just a bright and unpretentious introduction to the composer. The annotations (co-authored by conductor Smolij) suggest a resemblance between this work and Kabalevsky's Colas Breugnon overture, and I think that's right on the money. Next come Four Polish Dances (1954), and Szeligowski dresses them up so grandly that their folk origins are almost hidden. (Indeed, the outer portions of the \"Korow\u00f3d\" sound like what Elgar might have written on an Eastern European vacation.) The Piano Concerto (1941) is in a diverting neoclassical style that doesn't give much of a hint, except for the lightly melancholy second movement \u2013 that World War Two was raging through and around Poland as it was composed. Here, hints of Elgar have been replaced with hints of Poulenc, perhaps as a souvenir of Szeligowski's years in Paris. The extended Nocturne (1947) is lushly orchestrated, and exhales an atmosphere of magic and veiled eroticism. Finally, the Concerto for Orchestra (1930), composed while Szeligowski was in Paris, is an assured, attractive work, even if it doesn't approach later works in this genre by Bart\u00f3k or Szeligowski's younger countryman Lutos\u00bbawski. It is more modern in style than the other works on this CD, but still very digestible.\n\nThe Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic is a top-notch ensemble, and they do their founder proud with the performances on this CD. Smolij, an up-and-coming conductor, makes an excellent case for this music. Czapiewski sparkles in the concerto, and gives substance to its middle movement.\n\nOnce again, Naxos is to be praised for making virtually unknown music available to the masses in excellent performances, and at an almost give-away price.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2008, Raymond Tuttle"}, {"url": "https://timenote.info/en/Tadeusz-Szeligowski", "page_content": "Tadeusz Szeligowski (13 September 1896 - 10 January 1963) was a Polish composer, educator, lawyer and music organizer.

There he attended many concerts and intensely experienced the latest compositions by Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, ballet productions of many famous companies, as well as highly acclaimed performances by Jascha Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein and Ignacy Jan Paderewski.\n\nMusical career\n\nIn 1923 Szeligowski worked in Vilnius, Lithuania, as lawyer and lecturer at the Conservatory of Music. There he met Karol Szymanowski and became a great admirer of his music. He also worked with a dramatic theatre called Reduta, composing music for many of its productions. Shortly after his return to Poland in 1931, he began teaching music in Pozna\u0144 until 1939, and then moved to Lublin for a little while after the World War II. From 1947-1962 he worked for The State Higher School Of Music (Pa\u0144stwowa Wyzsza Szko\u0142a Muzyczna) in Pozna\u0144, and from 1947-1950 he became director of the National Opera Academy, when on his own initiative the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic was created. In addition, he was the initiator of the festival of contemporary music, the \"Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring\", where modern music was then presented in all its glory, and one of the organizers of the H. Wieniawski International Violin Competition. From 1951-1962 Szeligowski worked in Warsaw, first for the faculty of the Fryderik Chopin University of Music in Warsaw, and later as director of the Polish Society of Composers.\n\nA large group of his graduates on composition include: Zbigniew Bargielski, Augustyn Bloch, Joanna Bruzdowicz, Wojciech Lukaszewski, Tadeusz Wojciech Maklakiewicz, Boleslaw Ocias, Witold Rudzinski, Marek Sart, Aleksander Szeligowski and Antoni Szuniewicz.\n\nAs a music writer\n\nLvov\u2019s musical scene at that time included a city opera, a symphonic orchestra, a music society and also a conservatory of music, and there Szeligowski was very active as a social organizer. Musicians such as Felix Weingartner and Oscar Nedbal usually visited the city and frequently performed works by Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner. From 1951-1954 he served as chairman of the Polish Composers Union, and from 1953 he worked for the Board of Polish Music Publishers and the Central Pedagogical Office for Arts Education (COPSA).

There he found work as repetiteur at the Krak\u00f3w Opera House, allowing him to become well acquainted with the opera repertoire.\n\nHe complemented his studies in music in the years 1929-1931 in Paris, where he met many composers of his time such as Sergei Prokofiev, George Enesco and Arthur Honegger. There he studied composition with Nadia Boulanger and orchestration with Paul Dukas. There he attended many concerts and intensely experienced the latest compositions by Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc, ballet productions of many famous companies, as well as highly acclaimed performances by Jascha Heifetz, Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein and Ignacy Jan Paderewski.\n\nMusical career\n\nIn 1923 Szeligowski worked in Vilnius, Lithuania, as lawyer and lecturer at the Conservatory of Music. There he met Karol Szymanowski and became a great admirer of his music. He also worked with a dramatic theatre called Reduta, composing music for many of its productions. Shortly after his return to Poland in 1931, he began teaching music in Pozna\u0144 until 1939, and then moved to Lublin for a little while after the World War II. From 1947-1962 he worked for The State Higher School Of Music (Pa\u0144stwowa Wyzsza Szko\u0142a Muzyczna) in Pozna\u0144, and from 1947-1950 he became director of the National Opera Academy, when on his own initiative the Pozna\u0144 Philharmonic was created. In addition, he was the initiator of the festival of contemporary music, the \"Pozna\u0144 Musical Spring\", where modern music was then presented in all its glory, and one of the organizers of the H. Wieniawski International Violin Competition. From 1951-1962 Szeligowski worked in Warsaw, first for the faculty of the Fryderik Chopin University of Music in Warsaw, and later as director of the Polish Society of Composers.\n\nA large group of his graduates on composition include: Zbigniew Bargielski, Augustyn Bloch, Joanna Bruzdowicz, Wojciech Lukaszewski, Tadeusz Wojciech Maklakiewicz, Boleslaw Ocias, Witold Rudzinski, Marek Sart, Aleksander Szeligowski and Antoni Szuniewicz.

Musicians such as Felix Weingartner and Oscar Nedbal usually visited the city and frequently performed works by Giuseppe Verdi and Richard Wagner. From 1951-1954 he served as chairman of the Polish Composers Union, and from 1953 he worked for the Board of Polish Music Publishers and the Central Pedagogical Office for Arts Education (COPSA).
