The most heavily populated region of Europe, the kingdom of France provided its rulers with greater resources than any of their rivals. Philip Augustus led French contingents on the most fully international of the great Crusades (1190\u201391), although, having once demonstrated his energy in that work of piety, he could not afterward be persuaded to renew his vow. He preferred, through dynastic schemes and opportunism, to pursue his rivalry with the Plantagenets. His ambition seems to have embraced England as early as 1193, when he married Ingeborg, whose brother, the king of Denmark, had an old claim to the throne of England. When Philip, for private reasons, repudiated Ingeborg the day after the wedding and sought to have the marriage annulled, she and her brother appealed to the pope; her case, punctuated by reconciliations with Philip dictated more by policy than by sentiment, dragged on through the pontificate of Innocent III.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1200, Philip\u2019s son Louis married Blanche of Castile, granddaughter of Henry II, through whom another claim to England was heralded. Louis\u2019s career as prince was marked by aggressive designs against King John. Innocent III was prepared to recognize Louis as king of England in 1213; and the policy was dropped only after Louis\u2019s abortive invasion of 1216\u201317.\n\nIt was in the play of rival coalitions that Philip Augustus had his greatest diplomatic anxiety and success. Philip countered John\u2019s alliance with Otto IV of Brunswick, his nephew and claimant to the empire, by supporting a second claimant, Philip of Swabia. When Otto became Holy Roman emperor in 1209 and the counts of Flanders and Boulogne were alienated from their Capetian suzerain, Philip found himself seriously threatened in his northern heartlands. John\u2019s desire to avenge the loss of his French fiefs finally prompted him to act in 1214; he led a force from the west, and his major allies marched on Paris from the north. Philip Augustus met the allied forces at Bouvines in July 1214 and won a decisive victory. As John retreated and his coalition collapsed, there could be no doubt that Capetian France had achieved hegemony in Christian Europe.\n\nLouis IX acted astutely, though in ways unlike his grandfather\u2019s, to preserve the prestige of France. His treaties with Aragon and England, designed to extend and secure his domains, resulted from a cordiality better appreciated abroad than by the royal counselors. From Navarra and Lorraine as well as from within the realm were brought disputes for his judgment; and in the Mise of Amiens (1264) Louis responded to the appeal of Henry III and the English barons to pronounce on the validity of the Provisions of Oxford (a written agreement between the king and magnates in England to reform the state of the realm). But the more absorbing issues of Louis\u2019s diplomacy lay in the east. He resisted papal urgings to take sides against Otto\u2019s successor, Frederick II, believing in the equal legitimacy of empire and papacy. On the other hand, he allowed his brother Charles I of Anjou to accept the crown of Sicily from the pope; for this enterprise, as well as for his own Crusades, he allowed the papacy to tax the French clergy. His paramount foreign interest was to recover the holy places of Christ, a traditional ambition characteristically associated in his mind with the hope of converting the infidel: the Mongols or the emir of Tunis.\n\nLouis IX first took the cross in 1244, upon learning that a Turkish-Egyptian coalition had driven the Christians of the Levant back to precarious coastal positions. His expedition, which was well planned and well financed, set out in 1248, only to founder in the plague-ridden floodwaters of Egypt a year and a half later. Louis himself was captured; upon his release he spent four years in Syria in support of the Christian cause. He renewed his Crusader\u2019s vow in 1267, in circumstances clouded by Angevin-Sicilian politics. Charles, whose inordinate Mediterranean ambitions had little in common with the traditional Crusade, secretly persuaded the new expedition to divert to Tunis. It broke up there with the king\u2019s death in 1270.\n\nThe prestige of France in Christendom lost little from these failures of Louis IX. Nor was it generally foreseen that Aquitaine and Sicily would become battlegrounds in the future. The apparent strength of his father\u2019s diplomacy deterred Philip III from changing it, even though circumstances had changed. When in 1282 the misrule of Charles of Anjou caused the Sicilians to revolt in favour of Peter III of Aragon, leading to the War of the Sicilian Vespers, a test of the Angevin policy could no longer be deferred. Charles\u2019s friend Pope Martin IV (reigned 1281\u201385) excommunicated the king of Aragon and offered the vacant throne to Philip for one of his sons. Because at this juncture the crown of Navarra was destined for Philip\u2019s son and successor, Philip the Fair, the whole Spanish March seemed ripe for recovery by the French. Yet the Crusade against Aragon, blatantly political and impractical, came to a catastrophic end: the king himself died as his battered forces staggered out of Catalonia (October 1285). Charles of Anjou and Martin IV also died in 1285. Understandably, Philip the Fair, who had foreseen the folly of the ill-conceived attack on Aragon, no longer permitted Mediterranean concerns to dominate foreign policy. The issue over Sicily dragged on, but minor Capetian interests in the Pyrenees and in Castile were allowed to lapse.\n\nThe extension of French influence and domain toward the north and east was the result of resourceful diplomacy at the expense of the empire. Philip\u2019s interest in that direction was emphasized when his sister married the son of Albert I of Germany and when he proposed first his brother and later his son as candidates for the imperial title. But it was against the English holdings in France that Philip exercised his most aggressive and portentous diplomacy.\n\nQuestions over spheres of administrative rights in Aquitaine had been creating tensions for many years. By the Treaty of Amiens (1279) the Agenais, whose status had been left in doubt when Alphonse of Poitiers died, passed to Edward I of England, who also had unsettled claims in Quercy. Serious conflict was precipitated in 1293, when clashes between French and English seamen caused Philip the Fair to summon his vassal to Parlement. When Gascon castles occupied by the French as part of the settlement were not returned to the English on schedule, Edward renounced his homage and prepared to fight for Aquitaine. The war that ensued (1294\u20131303) went in favour of Philip the Fair, whose armies thrust deep into Gascony. Edward retaliated by allying with Flanders and other northern princes. His dangerous campaign, concerted with the count of Flanders in 1297, met defeat from a French force led by Robert of Artois, and during a truce from 1297 to 1303 the rival monarchs reestablished the status quo ante. Edward married Philip\u2019s sister, and a marriage was projected between Prince Edward and Philip\u2019s daughter.\n\nA consequence of this first war was to be the chronic insubordination of Flanders. After the count\u2019s surrender and imprisonment, it was left to the Flemish burghers to revolt against the French garrisons, and the French knights suffered a terrible defeat at Courtrai in July 1302. Thereafter the tide turned. But it was only in 1305 that a settlement satisfactory to the king could be reached; even then it proved impossible to win full ratification from the Flemish townsmen, whose resistance remained an invariable factor in the latent hostility between France and England.\n\nIn 1320 Philip the Fair\u2019s son, Philip V, obtained Edward II\u2019s personal homage, but friction was increasing in Gascony again. When Edward refused to do homage to Philip V\u2019s brother and successor, Charles IV, an old issue relating to French rights in Saint-Sardos (in Agenais) flamed into a war that once again went in favour of the French. By the Treaty of Paris (March 1327) France recovered Agenais and Bazadais and imposed a heavy indemnity on England, but a number of issues were left unresolved. Meanwhile, having married the emperor Henry VII\u2019s daughter, Charles was tempted to negotiate for the vacant imperial title in 1324; but nothing came of this. The last Capetians, although troubled at home, retained their international standing among neighbouring states, which were no less troubled."}, {"url": "https://www.nber.org/digest/feb19/french-trade-revolution-1860-win-win-liberalization", "page_content": "When tariffs fell, instead of losing market share to Great Britain and becoming a net importer, France was able to sustain global sales even as imports surged.\n\nWhile in exile in Britain in the 1830s, France's Louis Napol\u00e9on had a ringside seat as his host country took its first steps toward liberalizing trade. He liked what he saw, and envisioned jumpstarting the French economy by eliminating trade barriers and lowering tariffs.\n\nWhen he became emperor in 1852, Napol\u00e9on III found that leading industrialists staunchly defended protectionist trade laws, fearing that without them they would lose market share to foreign competition. After consolidating power, he assigned Michel Chevalier to undertake secret negotiations with the British to dramatically reduce trade barriers. The result, the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty of 1860, was \"a watershed in the history of modern international trade,\" according to St\u00e9phane Becuwe, Bertrand Blancheton, and Christopher M. Meissner, who have analyzed this treaty's impact in International Competition and Adjustment: Evidence from the First Great Liberalization (NBER Working Paper 25173).\n\n\n\nBecause the treaty was concluded without direct input from commercial interests, it came as a shock. Nevertheless, French industry adapted smoothly to the new competitive environment. Studying these effects may provide insights on the consequences of trade policy changes both today and in the first wave of globalization.\n\n\n\nIn 1860, Great Britain and France were the world's largest and second-largest exporters. France had banned imports of the great majority of woolen and cotton fabrics. A common fear was that without these protections, more-efficient British competitors would gain market share at the expense of domestic producers. But the doomsday predictions did not materialize. Supported by government adjustment loans, French producers upgraded their operations, diversified their export base and differentiated their product lines. Intra-industry trade patterns adjusted, allowing for a smooth adjustment to the new trade environment. \"Instead of losing market share to Great Britain and moving towards net import status,\" the researchers find, \"France was able to sustain global sales even as imports surged.\" In contrast, they note, an inter-industry response to falling tariffs would have involved disruptive, large-scale reallocation of labor and resources.\n\n\n\nIntra-industry trade as a share of total French trade tripled between 1859\u201360, when it accounted for about 14 percent of trade, and 1872, when it accounted for 38 percent. While some products lost market share, French factories survived and thrived by producing unique brands. The researchers point out that the sectors that concerned protectionists most \u2014 cotton, wool, and silk cloth \u2014 did see intensified competition, but exports and imports rose together.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty the French signed commercial pacts with more than half a dozen other nations. These, too, were associated with increases in the share of trade accounted for by intra-industrial products. The researchers conclude that these reforms benefited both French industry and French consumers. \"French industry and trade seems to have remained buoyant. ...French consumers are also likely to have gained through a higher variety of products available and at lower cost.\"\n\n\u2014 Steve Maas"}, {"url": "https://www.france24.com/en/france/20220311-trickle-down-in-drips-and-drops-the-french-economy-after-five-years-under-macron", "page_content": "FRENCH PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron finally hit the campaign trail in March, vying for re-election after a crisis-laden five years for France, Europe and the world beyond. After poring over Macron's record on foreign affairs last week, FRANCE 24 now takes a look at how the centrist has measured up on economics over the course of his tenure.\n\nAdvertising Read more\n\nThis is the second installment of FRANCE 24's four-part series on Emmanuel Macron's record as French president on foreign policy, economics, social spending and keeping campaign promises.\n\nTo listen to Macron's supporters, the economy is where the incumbent's record shines brightest. The French economy's attractiveness to business, its competitiveness, its performances on growth, employment and purchasing power \u2013 it's all coming up roses, Macron told French voters in an open letter on March 3 declaring his bid to seek a second term in April.\n\nHow close to reality does that campaign pitch run? As is often the case in economics, it all depends on one's perspective. Macron won office in 2017 with an overarching economic objective: to \"liberate work and the spirit of enterprise\", as his platform pledged, in order to encourage growth, reduce unemployment and boost French consumers' purchasing power.\n\nTo get there, Macron \u2013 a former investment banker who had served as economy minister under Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2013 promised deep economic reforms, to effect concrete change within France and to transform foreign investors' perceptions of the country's economy.\n\nFor businesses, Macron dropped the tax rate on firms from 33.3 percent to 25 percent, slashed the cost of labour by transforming a \u20ac20 billion a year tax credit into a permanent reduction on social security contributions for employers. He also had the French labour code modified to help firms by facilitating layoffs. For individuals, Macron did away with the wealth tax (the imp\u00f4t sur la fortune, or ISF) and created a fixed one-time levy on capital gains to stimulate investment in companies and the real economy in trickle-down fashion.\n\nFive years after Macron's election, the raw numbers are relatively flattering. GDP growth, for one, reached 7 percent in 2021, according to an initial January estimate by the French statistics office, Insee. That exceptionally high figure represents the rebound the French economy enjoyed after a historic dip (- 8 percent) during the pandemic-inflicted recession of 2020, although France's subsequent bounce was one of the most robust of any country in the eurozone. France's unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to 7.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, a figure not seen since 2008.\n\nFrance's image abroad and its attractiveness to foreign investors also saw considerable gains. Macron's La R\u00e9publique en Marche party boasts that France became Europe's most attractive country to investors over the course of the incumbent's term, with France registering 985 foreign investment projects in 2020, versus 975 in the United Kingdom and 930 in Germany, according to EY Consulting's attractiveness index.\n\nJob security and quality on the wane\n\nAnd yet those strong results only tell part of the story, particularly as to French attractiveness and the country's ability to compete globally. France's trade balance, especially, remains a major preoccupation with its foreign trade deficit surging another \u20ac7.3 billion in 2020 to \u20ac65.2 billion.\n\nThe country's unemployment rate, moreover, dropped primarily on the basis of a rise in job insecurity for salaried workers. To spur recruitment, France sought to reassure companies that they could indeed let go of their hires in the face of adversity, in line with 2017 reforms. As a result, firms more frequently provided low-security jobs (short-term contracts, temporary work, etc.). In 2020, 3.3 million people in France held low-security jobs, some 12.4 percent of total employment, according to Insee. But most importantly, the labour code change led to establishing a scale of labour court indemnities in cases of dismissal without real and serious cause. Employers can now lay personnel off without grounds, that is without respecting the law, and know beforehand how much such dismissals will cost them.\n\nBeyond a rise in job insecurity, Macron's five-year term was also notable for its diminished job quality for workers. The investigative news site Mediapart reported that the average number of hours worked fell from 32 hours a week in the second quarter of 2017, when Macron was elected, to 30.9 hours a week during the third quarter of 2021. Part of that drop was due to the Covid-19 crisis, but it was also a sign of a qualitative change in the labour workers carried out. Many of the openings created have been low-value-added commercial service jobs. In January, the government boasted that 2021 saw the creation of nearly 1 million businesses in France \u2013 \"quite simply a historic record\", Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said. But 641,543 of those businesses were what are known as micro-enterprises (formerly auto-enterprises), small businesses created by and for a sole trader.\n\nAnd finally, France tallied 1.9 million individuals who were no longer actively seeking employment in 2020, people thereby removed from the accounting of the country's unemployment figures. As the economist Maxime Combes pointed out on Twitter, the 7.4 percent unemployment rate figure is also a function of the number of jobseekers withdrawn from the count, a figure that grew fast after a 2020 pandemic-related hiatus. Likewise, Macron's unemployment insurance reform, fully applied as of autumn 2021, could reduce the number of jobseekers who register with P\u00f4le Emploi, the unemployment insurance agency, due to a higher threshold of conditions required to qualify, specialists say.\n\nWealthiest grew wealthier, but business investment elusive\n\nFiscally speaking, while financial aid for businesses and other tax relief has not been evaluated recently, it has been shown that tax cuts on the wealthy have had no impact on business investment. \"Observing the important economic variables \u2013 growth, investment, household financial investment flows, etc. \u2013 before and after the reforms, is not enough to pronounce on the real effect of these reforms. In particular, it will not be possible to estimate, by that means alone, whether the abolition of the wealth tax led to a redirection of the relevant taxpayers' savings toward financing businesses,\" France Strat\u00e9gie, an institution under the onus of the prime minister's office, conceded in an October 2021 report evaluating tax reform on capital. However, the same report noted that Macron's reforms did lead to a 64 percent hike in dividend payments in 2018.\n\nThe wealthiest French individuals therefore did not choose to invest in the real economy, even as their purchasing power jumped over the past five years. As such, they come out the big winners of Macron's term in office. The 1 percent of France's wealthiest individuals, according to a November 2021 study by France's Institute for Public Policies (IPP), saw an average gain of 2.8 percent in their total revenue after taxes and benefits. The total increase is even more striking for the 0.1 percent of the country's wealthiest, who saw their purchasing power leap by some 4 percent.\n\nFor the rest of the French population, some of whom hit the streets across the country in revolt during a long and fiery series of Yellow Vest protests during Macron's term, the trickle-down effect arrived in drips and drops. According to the IPP, the total average rise in the standard of living for the French as a whole over the past five years is around 1.6 percent. The least privileged, the 5 percent of France's poorest households, were the biggest losers: their purchasing power sank 0.5 percent on average during the incumbent's tenure.\n\nThis article has been translated from the original in French.\n\nFrench presidential election \u00a9 France 24\n\nDaily newsletterReceive essential international news every morning Subscribe"}, {"url": "https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/99da245e-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/99da245e-en", "page_content": "France\n\nTourism in the economy Tourism plays a major role in the French economy. Traditional tourism sectors such as accommodation and food services, account for approximately 6% of GDP, but tourism also acts as an engine of growth for many other sectors. Total internal tourism consumption, which combines tourism-related spending by both French residents and non-residents, represents over 7% of GDP, with two-thirds of the total impact of tourism is accounted for by French residents. Direct tourism employment accounts for 1.4 million jobs, and over 2 million when considering indirect jobs. Tourism contributes positively to the balance of payments, with the tourism balance typically contributing between EUR 14 - 17 billion annually. Travel exports accounted for 22.2% of total service exports in 2018. Inbound tourism arrivals stood at just under 90 million in 2018, an increase of 3.0% from 2017. Thanks to heightened security measures and additional marketing efforts, visitor numbers have recovered from the drop that occurred in 2016 as a consequence of the 2015 terrorist attacks. In 2018, international tourism revenues were estimated at EUR 57 billion. EU countries account for 69% of all international arrivals, with the top three countries (United Kingdom, Germany and the Benelux countries) accounting for over 46%. A further 10% of visitors come from the Americas and 6.8% come from Asia. Domestic tourism accounted for 897.6 million nights in 2018, up 0.2% over 2017. 268.2 million domestic trips were taken in the same year, of which 189.8 million were overnight.\n\nTourism governance and funding Since 2014, responsibility for tourism policy is shared between the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs, which promotes France abroad as a tourist destination, and the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, which is responsible for the regulatory framework. An Inter-Ministerial Tourism Council meets twice a year under the chair of the Prime Minister, with the aim of encouraging ministries and departments working in tourism-related areas to move forward with priority projects. It is supported by a Steering Council chaired by the Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, which meets in the intervening period. Policy implementation involves two agencies under state control. Atout France, which is responsible for promoting France abroad, has the legal form of a group of economic interests which brings additional flexibility to its mission and sourcing of funds. Its budget is typically between EUR 70 - 75 million, with around half of this figure being state subsidy. The National Agency for Holiday Vouchers is an agency responsible for broadening access to holidays. At a territorial level, public governance of tourism concerns all levels. Each region is required to set up a Regional Tourism Committee, as well as preparing a regional tourism development plan setting out medium-term objectives and the terms governing policy implementation. Regions are also responsible for collecting tourism-related data, and for co-ordinating public and private initiatives in the fields of tourist information, development and promotion. Departmental tourism development schemes are prepared based on the guidelines outlined in the plans produced by regions, and Departmental Tourism Committees must also be established. At local level, municipalities granted powers to act in tourism-related fields can set up tourist offices to provide tourist information and promote the tourism offering, and may also market tourist services. To improve the co-ordination of tourism, a Strategic Tourism Committee was established as a framework for sharing information between sectors and for constructive collaboration on public policy (particularly as regards the mobility of employees in the sector). Stakeholders from all tourism-adjacent sectors are invited to join. France: Organisational chart of tourism bodies Source: OECD, adapted from the Directorate-General for Enterprise, 2020 Tourism benefits indirectly from state spending in other policy areas, including culture and heritage, transport infrastructure and environmental enhancement. Estimated total financial resources applied to tourism amounts to approximately EUR 5 billion.\n\nTourism policies and programmes The pattern of increasing tourist flows represents a key challenge in terms of the sustainability of tourism and its public acceptance. A high proportion of international tourist travel is concentrated in three French regions - the greater Paris area, the French Riviera, and the ski resorts of the Alps. In addition, the majority of French residents go on holiday to coastal regions, while the country\u2019s mountain regions are seeking new areas of growth to mitigate the adverse impacts of global warming on winter pursuits. France\u2019s tourism offer must therefore be structured more effectively, with target markets made more aware of its diversity. During the 2017 Inter-ministerial Tourism Council meeting (CIT), the roadmap for tourism development was set and the Government agreed to focus action on six key areas: Welcome and security - improvements in service standards have been achieved in particular through reduced visa waiting times and border crossing times at airports, while quality-related efforts are focused on modernising and promoting the Government\u2019s Tourism Quality label (Qualit\u00e9 Tourisme TM) .\n\nDispersal - in order to attract and disperse international tourists across France, including its overseas territories. Key elements include the destination contracts policy, which brings together all parties involved in delivering a local tourist offer.\n\nState support for investment - a major pillar of the Government\u2019s strategy for improving the quality of the tourist offer and promoting better connectivity. This is achieved through deployment of the France Tourism Development Fund (France d\u00e9veloppement tourisme).\n\nTraining and employment - crucial in terms of service quality and playing a major role in combating unemployment given the number of jobs created by the industry.\n\nSupporting digitalisation and information \u2013 specifically to increase the global competitiveness of France\u2019s tourism industry. Key elements include development of the DATAtourisme portal, France NUMerique (box 2.8), Tourisme Lab incubator network and economic intelligence observatory, Veille Info Tourisme.\n\nBroader access to holidays - in particular for people living with a disability, represents a social objective and a way to enhance the competitiveness of destinations; The Inter-Ministerial Tourism Council meetings have subsequently be organised around these priority areas. At its January 2018 meeting, which covered topics relating to promotion and investment, the Council approved an increase in funding for the tourism industry from the government-backed guarantor agency, Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts, and public investment bank, Bpifrance, and agreed permanent arrangements for transferring a portion of visa revenues to Atout France to fund advertising targeted at international markets. The Council acknowledged at its meeting in July 2018 that progress had been made in the digital sector, and examined proposals for improving synergies between sport and tourism. The meeting held in May 2019 focused on employment and training and related governance issues. Topics discussed included schemes to help local authorities, including, organisational support for the development of tourism-related economic activities at heritage sites, a VAT refund scheme, and a new project aimed at simplifying the regulatory framework for tourism. A meeting scheduled for late 2019 will focus, in particular, on broadening access to holidays and sustainable tourism. To bring forward co-ordinated action at the local level, destination contracts were formed in 2014 and are designed to encourage public-private partnerships around specific themes, with the aim of creating and promoting a clear and attractive offer for both national and international audiences. Each contract constitutes a commitment on the part of all interests to a shared tourism strategy, by means of actions which focus on the attractiveness of the offer and improved service quality. Destination contracts are a way of offsetting the disadvantages that arise from the very large number of public and private actors in the tourism industry and of bringing together local and national tourism strategies. While the investment of state funding is modest, this concept exercises considerable leverage. Twenty-three destination contracts were signed between 2015 and 2018, while a further eight were renewed in 2018. France has responded to the development of digital platforms, which is particularly relevant to tourist accommodation. Accommodation in private homes has become a major component of the national offer, especially in cities, but does not always further the objectives of housing policy. In an effort to avoid obstructing the development of a dynamic new economy in furnished tourist rentals, while preserving housing market equilibrium, France has opted to take a regulatory approach, in particular through the adoption of the 2018 Law on Changes in Housing, Land Management and Digital Technology, or ELAN Law. Under this Law, in areas severely affected by rising housing prices, municipalities will be able to impose restrictions on second-home rentals and limit the length of time for which a primary residence can be rented to 120 days per year (this 120-day limit is also imposed on platforms)."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/place/France/Economy", "page_content": "Economy of France\n\nFrance is one of the major economic powers of the world, ranking along with such countries as the United States, Japan, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Its financial position reflects an extended period of unprecedented growth that lasted for much of the postwar period until the mid-1970s; frequently this period was referred to as the trente glorieuses (\u201cthirty years of glory\u201d). Between 1960 and 1973 alone, the increase in gross domestic product (GDP) averaged nearly 6 percent each year. In the aftermath of the oil crises of the 1970s, growth rates were moderated considerably and unemployment rose substantially. By the end of the 1980s, however, strong expansion was again evident. This trend continued, although at a more modest rate, into the 21st century.\n\nDuring the same postwar period, the structure of the economy was altered significantly. While in the 1950s agriculture and industry were the dominant sectors, tertiary (largely service and administrative) activities have since become the principal employer and generator of national wealth. Similarly, while it was once the heavily urbanized and industrialized regions of northern and northeastern France that were developing most rapidly, in the 1980s these areas began losing jobs and population. Contemporary growth has switched to regions that lie in the south and, to a lesser degree, the west of France.\n\nDespite the dominance of the private sector, the tradition of a mixed economy in France is well established. Successive governments have intervened to protect or promote different types of economic activity, as has been clearly reflected in the country\u2019s national plans and nationalized industries. In the decades following World War II, the French economy was guided by a succession of national plans, each covering a span of approximately four to five years and designed to indicate rather than impose growth targets and development strategies.\n\nThe public sector in France first assumed importance in the post-World War II transition period of 1944\u201346 with a series of nationalizations that included major banks such as the National Bank of Paris (Banque Nationale de Paris; BNP) and Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais, large industrial companies such as Renault, and public services such as gas and electricity. Little change took place after that until 1982, when the then Socialist government introduced an extensive program of nationalization. As a result, the enlarged public sector contained more than one-fifth of industrial employment, and more than four-fifths of credit facilities were controlled by state-owned banking or financial institutions. Since that period successive right-wing and, more recently, left-of-centre governments have returned most enterprises to the private sector; state ownership is primarily concentrated in transport, defense, and broadcasting.\n\nPostwar economic growth has been accompanied by a substantial rise in living standards, reflected in the increasing number of families that own their home (about half), a reduction in the workweek (fixed at 35 hours), and the increase of vacation days taken each year by the French people. Another indicator of improved living standards is the growth of ownership of various household and consumer goods, particularly such items as automobiles and computers. Over time, however, consumption patterns have altered significantly.

Edouard Philippe laid down Wednesday the government's upcoming priorities at the lower house of parliament, the National Assembly. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus)\n\nPARIS (AP) \u2014 France\u2019s prime minister said Wednesday that the government of President Emmanuel Macron plans to keep reforming the economy to boost its competitiveness, with changes to unemployment benefits and the pension system and plans to help out middle-class workers with tax cuts.\n\nAddressing the lower house of parliament, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe laid out the government\u2019s upcoming priorities after two years in office.\n\nResponding to often violent yellow vest protests against Macron\u2019s policies that started in November, Philippe acknowledged it was \u201ca mistake\u201d that the government sometimes took decisions too quickly and without enough public consultation.\n\n\u201cWe want to change our manner of governing. We are and will remain reformers. But we must further involve the French in the decision-making,\u201d he said.\n\nCritics say Macron\u2019s economic policies tend to favor the wealthy and big businesses and are out of touch with everyday life.\n\nIn what he called the \u201cAct II\u201d of Macron\u2019s term \u2014which runs until 2022\u2014 Philippe listed a series of economic reforms which he said aimed to make France\u2019s economy more competitive.\n\nPhilippe said tax cuts will focus on middle-class workers, including 18 million French households who will see their annual incomes increase by about 180 to 350 euros ($204 to $396) next year on average.\n\n\u201cWith the President of the Republic, we received loud and clear the message of exasperation against taxes that the French people sent us. They no longer want words but acts,\u201d he said.\n\nA reform of France\u2019s generous unemployment benefits system will be presented next week \u2014 notably reducing benefits that wealthier workers are entitled to. France\u2019s unemployment rate has decreased, falling to 8.4 percent at the beginning of the year, its lowest in 10 years, Philippe said.\n\nMoves to reform the pension system will keep the legal retirement age at 62 \u2014 but benefits for those who do so will decrease, to encourage people to work longer. Details are expected to be unveiled in July.\n\nAnother bill later this year will grant single women and lesbian couples access to medically assisted reproduction, a campaign promise from Macron. The procedures are currently restricted to heterosexual couples.\n\nPhilippe confirmed France will remain militarily involved in the fight against the Islamic State group and in Africa\u2019s Sahel region. At home \u201cwe will maintain constant vigilance against the terrorist threat\u201d, he said.\n\nA debate followed the prime minister\u2019s speech at the National Assembly, where Macron\u2019s party has a strong majority."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/place/France/The-abolition-of-feudalism", "page_content": "The abolition of feudalism\n\nOf course the violence of peasant insurgency worried the deputies of the National Assembly; to some it seemed as if the countryside were being engulfed by anarchy that threatened all property. But the majority were unwilling to turn against the rebellious peasants. Instead of denouncing the violence, they tried to appease peasant opinion. Liberal nobles and clergy began the session of August 4 by renouncing their ancient feudal privileges. Within hours the Assembly was propelled into decreeing \u201cthe abolition of feudalism\u201d as well as the church tithe, venality of office, regional privilege, and fiscal privilege. A few days later, to be sure, the Assembly clarified the August 4 decree to assure that \u201clegitimate\u201d seigneurial property rights were maintained. While personal feudal servitudes such as hunting rights, seigneurial justice, and labour services were suppressed outright, most seigneurial dues were to be abolished only if the peasants paid compensation to their lords, set at 20 to 25 times the annual value of the obligation. The vast majority of peasants rejected that requirement by passive resistance, until pressure built in 1792\u201393 for the complete abolition of all seigneurial dues without compensation.\n\nThe abolition of feudalism was crucial to the evolution of a modern, contractual notion of property and to the development of an unimpeded market in land. But it did not directly affect the ownership of land or the level of ordinary rents and leases. Seigneurs lost certain kinds of traditional income, but they remained landowners and landlords. While all peasants gained in dignity and status, only the landowning peasants came out substantially ahead economically. Tenant farmers found that what they had once paid for the tithe was added on to their rent. And the Assembly did virtually nothing to assure better lease terms for renters and sharecroppers, let alone their acquisition of the land they tilled."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/mercantilism", "page_content": "The primary countries that employed mercantilism were of western Europe\u2014 France , Spain , Portugal , Italy , and Britain , as well as Germany and the Netherlands. Since colonies were regarded as existing for the benefit of their mother countries, the colonized parts of North America , South America , and Africa were involuntarily involved with mercantilism and were required to sell raw materials only to their colonizers and to purchase finished goods only from their mother countries.\n\nmercantilism, economic theory and practice common in Europe from the 16th to the 18th century that promoted governmental regulation of a nation\u2019s economy for the purpose of augmenting state power at the expense of rival national powers. It was the economic counterpart of political absolutism. Its 17th-century publicists\u2014most notably Thomas Mun in England, Jean-Baptiste Colbert in France, and Antonio Serra in Italy\u2014never, however, used the term themselves; it was given currency by the Scottish economist Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations (1776).\n\nMercantilism contained many interlocking principles. Precious metals, such as gold and silver, were deemed indispensable to a nation\u2019s wealth. If a nation did not possess mines or have access to them, precious metals should be obtained by trade. It was believed that trade balances must be \u201cfavourable,\u201d meaning an excess of exports over imports. Colonial possessions should serve as markets for exports and as suppliers of raw materials to the mother country. Manufacturing was forbidden in colonies, and all commerce between colony and mother country was held to be a monopoly of the mother country.\n\nMore From Britannica Western colonialism: Mercantilism\n\nA strong nation, according to the theory, was to have a large population, for a large population would provide a supply of labour, a market, and soldiers. Human wants were to be minimized, especially for imported luxury goods, for they drained off precious foreign exchange. Sumptuary laws (affecting food and drugs) were to be passed to make sure that wants were held low. Thrift, saving, and even parsimony were regarded as virtues, for only by these means could capital be created. In effect, mercantilism provided the favourable climate for the early development of capitalism, with its promises of profit.\n\nLater, mercantilism was severely criticized. Advocates of laissez-faire argued that there was really no difference between domestic and foreign trade and that all trade was beneficial both to the trader and to the public. They also maintained that the amount of money or treasure that a state needed would be automatically adjusted and that money, like any other commodity, could exist in excess. They denied the idea that a nation could grow rich only at the expense of another and argued that trade was in reality a two-way street. Laissez-faire, like mercantilism, was challenged by other economic ideas."}]}
