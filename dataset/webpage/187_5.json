The talented guard was selected by the World Champion Detroit Pistons in the second round with the 54th pick. Detroit just happens to be Paulding's home town. Paulding will also join former Missouri Associate Head Coach and current Pistons' Vice President of Basketball Operations John Hammond in the ranks of the Mizzou basketball family who have reached the NBA.\n\n\"Detroit is a great team and organization and I want to contribute in any way I can,\" Paulding said from his home in Detroit. \"It has always been a dream to play in my home town with the Pistons and be apart of their great tradition. It's a really good opportunity and I am looking forward to proving myself in the coming months.\"\n\nPaulding is the third player to be drafted to the NBA during head coach Quin Snyder's five-year tenure at Mizzou. Keyon Dooling was the 10th pick in the 2000 draft by the Orlando Magic (who then traded Dooling to the Los Angeles Clippers the same night) and Kareem Rush was the 20th pick in the 2002 draft by the Toronto Raptors (who then traded Rush to the Los Angeles Lakers on the night of the draft).\n\n\"We are very excited for Rickey and I think he has a good chance to be successful in Detroit,\" Missouri Head Coach Quin Snyder said. \"He's entering a great situation and he will be around a lot of familiar faces in his home town. Rickey needs to attack this chance to play at the next level with the same competitive fire he has shown during his time at Mizzou.\"\n\nPaulding wrapped up a tremendous career at Mizzou with a crowning achievement in May as he received his degree. He finished his basketball career as the eighth leading scorer in Mizzou history (1,673 points) and finished fifth in three point field goals made with 187. Paulding seemed to especially love NCAA Tournament time, as he finished his career as Mizzou's all-time leader in points scored in the tourney with 145 (18.1 per game) in eight games played.

He began his career at Kingswood school in West Hartford and then played at Marist (NCAA) from 2003-2007 being named MAAC player of the year in 2007 and led the NCAA in assists twice. He began his professional career in 2007 in Lithuania with top team Lietuvos Rytas Vilnius (Lithuania-LKL) and played a season in the then D-League with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers. He returned to Europe in 2009 and would play the rest of his career overseas until 2020. He was most of his time in Germany where he played 8 seasons for teams like the Telekom Baskets Bonn, Brose Bamberg and the Tigers Tuebingen. He also played in Greece with VAP Kolossos Rodou, in Spain with Gipuzkoa BC San Sebastian and closed out his career in Romania with BC CSU Sibiu. It didn\u2019t matter where he played but as some say that guy is a walking bucket, Jordan was a walking dime as he led the easyCredit BBL in assists 6 times and also led the top European league ACB in Spain in assists and in Greece and Romania. He was a three time BBL allstar and is the all-time easyCredit assist leader breaking ex Lebron James teammate Dru Joyce\u2019s mark in 2017 with his 1458th assist.

Where are you and how is life treating you at the moment?\n\n\n\nHey miles, I am in West Hartford CT where we have lived since I retried a couple years ago. Everything is good here and nice to be settled back home.\n\nYou retired from the game in 2020. You have made the next step in your life and are in real estate. How is that new challenge?\n\n\n\nReal estate has been really good so far. It has been a crazy market the last couple years but it keeps me busy and has a competitive side to it as well which I love.\n\nYou have been away from the game for 2 years. What do you miss the most?\n\nIt\u2019s not easy playing for 13 years professionally and then just stopping. I do miss the game of basketball. I especially miss the daily routine and competitiveness. It was a great 13 years but I knew my time was over once covid hit.\n\nRickey Paulding had his farewell game on June 4. What is the first thing that you think about when you hear Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nWhen I hear Ricky\u2019s name the first think I think of is ultimate professional. He just always seemed to go about his business in such a professional manner that all you can do is respect him.\n\nHave you ever seen a player that was able to play so well at such a high age?\n\n\n\nWhat Ricky did was so impressive because he was so consistent for so many years. It\u2019s not easy doing that but he made it look easy!\n\nWhat do you think was your record against him? Were you above or below 500?\n\n\n\nIf I had to guess I was below 500 vs him unfortunately but we had some good battles over the years!\n\nYou were 7-12. You were 7-5 with the Telekom baskets Bonn, but your time with Tuebingen hurt your overall record as you were 0-6. How do you remember Rickey Paulding the competitor?\n\nHahah the 0-6 def hurts. I remember our battles and playoff games vs each other when I was in Bonn. Ricky was the ultimate competitor and always showed up when it mattered. He would always hit tough shots when it really counted.\n\nYou had very memorable games against him early in your career. In the 11-12 season you were 2-0 and had 18 and 15 assists games. What do you remember from these games?\n\n\n\nI remember the 18 assist game playing in the old arena in Oldenburg. It was like a scorer getting hot and I found a rhythm and it just clicked. I was lucky guys made shots which is always key!\n\nIn the 12-13 season you lost a tough 5 game series to Oldenburg. What memories do you have from this series?\n\n\n\nThat was a great series. You know what sticks out was Kyle Weems having like 30 points in the first half in one of the games. I knew at that time that Kyle was going to have a great career!\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you feel will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL. Do you feel there will ever be another American that will reach his longevity?\n\n\n\nWhat Ricky has done and the respect he\u2019s earned from everyone in Germany will be hard to match. He was one of the best players, competitors and professionals the BBL will ever see.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey.\n\nRickey, congrats on an amazing career! You were always one of my favorite players and the way you went about it was something I always admired.

The US-American from EWE Baskets Oldenburg was the second player in history to break the 7000 point mark. Meanwhile, champions Alba Berlin and Bayern Munich showed no nakedness on matchday three.\n\nPaulding, the Oldenburg club idol, reached the milestone on Saturday evening at 86:69 (55:38) against the Fraport Skyliners Frankfurt with a three to 60:38 (22nd minute). The 38-year-old finished the game with 16 points and now stands at 7003 in total.\n\n\u201cIt feels good. When my career is over, I can look back on it with pride. I never dared to dream of making it,\u201d said the forward at MagentaSport. His coach Mladen Drijenjic was enthusiastic: \u201cA historic moment for the club, for the team, for the league. I\u2019m really happy that I was able to experience it and celebrate it with a player like Rickey.\u201d\n\nPaulding, who has played for Oldenburg since 2007 and won the championship (2009) and cup (2015) with the club, is still in second place on the \u201ceternal\u201d scorer list behind Mike Jackel. The former German national player ended his BBL career in 1999 with 10,783 points. The statistics only take into account the games since the introduction of the single-track Bundesliga for the 1975/76 season.\n\nJackel (61), the European champion from 1993, can no longer catch up with Paulding. As the BBL calculated, he would have to complete 278 games with his previous career point average (13.6) \u2013 this corresponds to 8.2 main rounds.\n\nBayern Munich take revenge\n\nAlba didn\u2019t give Telekom Baskets Bonn a chance on Sunday at 97:74 (48:38). The guests received their third defeat in the third game. The Hamburg Towers kept their clean slate with a 90:61 (46:31) at s.Oliver W\u00fcrzburg.\n\nIn the evening Bayern Munich took revenge against runner-up MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg. The Munich team won 93:70 (38:38) against the Swabians, who had caused the defending champion at the time to be eliminated from the quarter-finals at the final around five months ago.\n\nThe Giessen 46ers had no chance in their first game of the season. The Middle Hesse, who were only able to prepare for a good three days after their quarantine, were subject to ratiopharm Ulm 81: 106 (33:60). The Niners Chemnitz also lost their second BBL game.

When you\u2019re sitting down at a table with great food and great people \u2026 nothing else matters. It\u2019s kind of an escape from reality a little bit. It\u2019s that break in the middle of your day or night that really does allow time to stand still.\u201d\n\nWith Ima \u2014 which also has a location in Corktown \u2014 Ransom has seized the larger culinary moment as well.\n\nIma has all the hallmarks of a trendy, chef-driven spot, where each dish is carefully sourced, thoughtfully constructed and colorfully presented by friendly staff in a minimalist space blaring electronic music; where French techniques underpin au courant Japanese and Korean flavors and ingredients that the classically trained chef grew up on.\n\nFine-dining Ima decidedly is not, instead it rides the current wave of fast-casual service that\u2019s almost necessary to turn a profit in a mid-priced restaurant where two people can enjoy apps, entrees and drinks for less than $50. Food of this gourmet quality is rarely this affordable.\n\nMore:Ima named Detroit Free Press Restaurant of the Year for 2019\n\nThe journey starts at the door.\n\nTen or so courses of impeccably sourced, improbably cooked food that will unfold over a span of three hours. Depending on your level of devotion to these types of experiences, it might turn out to be one of the best meals of your life.\n\nAll the superlatives you hear tossed around about great food apply, but let\u2019s be concrete: chef Thomas Lents creates the finest, most precise dining experience Detroit has seen in years. (If not ever.)\n\nMore:Chef\u2019s Table in downtown Detroit is our 2018 Restaurant of the Year\n\nDon\u2019t let the name fool you: There\u2019s nothing drab about Mabel Gray.\n\nThe Hazel Park restaurant glows an ardent orange during packed dinner hours, smoldering with the heady aromas of north African green harissa and pungent Thai fish-sauce caramel from its kaleidoscopic global pantry.\n\nFor a place that shares the name of a fabled Lake Michigan recluse and her legendary ghost, the restaurant is surprisingly full of life and conviviality, a serried mass of hungry patrons often crowding the 3-by-6-foot waiting area while \u201890s hip-hop blares from the speakers.\n\nBut its moniker makes sense when you realize that the restaurant is chef-owner James Rigato\u2019s own culinary anthem, inspired more by the eponymous folk song by the band Brown Bird than by the legend of the hermit Alice Mabel Gray.\n\nMore:2017 Restaurant of the Year: Mabel Gray\n\nThe menu may change with the seasons, but at Chartreuse Kitchen & Cocktails in Midtown Detroit, spring is always in the air.\n\nYou could point to the green-colored walls, the produce display in the front window, the living wall of succulents or the curtain of dried flowers near the back of the dining room as reasons for the season.\n\nBut it\u2019s more than that.To be sure, executive chef Doug Hewitt\u2019s dignified rustic dishes \u2014 think earthy mushroom ricotta with preserved onion on toasted sourdough, or Michigan-farmed shrimp with andouille sausage, spring peas, black lentils and tangy pickled cabbage \u2014 are exceptionally fresh, even in the depths of a gray Detroit winter.\n\nChartreuse is the Detroit Free Press Restaurant of the Year\n\n2015: Selden Standard, Detroit\n\nTwo or three years ago, few people would have expected a restaurant of this quality and style to open near a derelict corner a block from Cass Avenue.\n\nBut chef-owner Andy Hollyday and co-owner Evan Hansen believed so firmly in the city's comeback, they bet their futures on it, turning a graffiti-scarred dry cleaners at Second and Selden into an oasis for food lovers.\n\nTheir timing couldn't have been better: Detroit's restaurant scene blossomed last year in a way it hadn't in decades \u2014 and Selden Standard is the best of the best.\n\n2014: Torino, Ferndale (closed 2015)\n\nChef Garrett Lipar and his staff of four create their alchemy in a 9-by-15-foot kitchen \u2014 a space smaller than some walk-in closets. There is no gas cooktop, no walk-in cooler and a freezer that holds only ice cream. But Lipar works around the obstacles, using countertop induction units instead of gas burners, for example. The kitchen's under-counter refrigerator is small, so he must receive more frequent deliveries, \"but that means we are always giving our guests the freshest things,\" he says.\n\n2013: Bacco Ristorante, Southfield\n\nBacco has not only survived, it has thrived by finding innovative new ways to serve customers; stayed fresh by embracing lighter, healthier ingredients, and remained laser-focused on producing dishes that shine with flavor, sophistication and integrity. With its unwavering focus on culinary excellence and its ability to evolve without sacrificing standards, Bacco Ristorante is truly one of Detroit's great dining destinations.\n\n2012: The Root Restaurant & Bar, White Lake Township\n\nBy some definitions, they were upstarts. And by any logical measure, their idea was a gamble. But guided by their own tastes and an intuitive sense for what diners want, they have created a food-driven destination in White Lake Township that hits one right note after another \u2014 a restaurant not only in tune with today's tastes and needs, but one that takes seriously the economic and environmental issues that should guide what we consume.\n\n2011: Union Woodshop, Clarkston\n\nWhat the Woodshop offers customers is honest, down-to-earth and real. The plates are aluminum baking pans; the potato salad gets spooned right on the tray liner. Iced tea comes in a jar, and the sauces are in plastic bottles. The servers don't wear uniforms, and they stop and chat with folks they know. We told you: It's casual. But there's nothing casual about the care, quality and integrity that go on in the kitchen \u2014 or that went into resurrecting a restaurant from its recessionary ashes.\n\n2010: Forest Grill, Birmingham (closed and reopened as Forest, 2015)\n\nForest Grill \"reminded us that exceptional food isn't defined by price, exotic ingredients or gimmicky techniques \u2014 and that exceptional restaurants can be as near as the next corner.\"\n\n2009: Michael Symon's Roast, Westin Book Cadillac, Detroit\n\nFire licks the back of the wood-burning oven. Fire glows in the mesquite and hardwood charcoal that fuels the custom-built, 6-foot-long grill where steaks are cooked. And fire slowly roasts the Beast of the Day \u2014 a whole suckling pig, young goat or baby lamb that will cook for 6 to 10 hours in the open stainless steel rotisserie beside the dining room.\n\n2008: SaltWater, MGM Grand Detroit (closed 2012)\n\nAt 5 p.m. on a recent Thursday, an air of expectancy \u2014 or maybe nervousness \u2014 fills the kitchen. It is time for the nightly tasting ritual, when chef de cuisine Steven Fretz or his sous chefs, Dan Campbell and Marc St. Jacques, taste and judge every sauce and garnish on every dish on the menu, before the restaurant opens.\n\n2007: Beverly Hills Grill, Beverly Hills\n\nAnd then there are Saturday mornings, with pony-tailed Mark Ellison mixing Bloody Marys and mimosas at the bar. All eight seats at the U-shaped counter are filled with regulars he greets by name as he sets up their usual without being asked. He's so well-liked, people wait for a seat at the bar just so he can be their server.\n\n2006: Seldom Blues, Detroit (closed 2010)\n\nThat's the thing about Seldom Blues, the elegant Renaissance Center restaurant that has evolved into Detroit's most distinctive and memorable dining experience: You can't isolate just one element and say that's its secret. It's the distinctive combination of all of them \u2014 a balance of great atmosphere, smooth service, delicious food, and soulful, sophisticated music.\n\n2005: Five Lakes Grill, Milford (closed 2009)\n\nThey're part of the charcuterie revival occurring at top restaurants all over the country. Such food might seem out of place at Five Lakes, given chef Brian Polcyn's avowed disdain for trends, but he didn't just discover it, he's made it for years.\n\n2004: Jeremy Restaurant & Bar, Keego Harbor (closed 2014)\n\nAsk him how he can turn just a handful of ingredients into such complex, intriguing dishes ... how he makes even bland whitefish memorable ... why his vegetables are so vivid and the surface of his seared mahimahi so crisp. Surely there's a trick to all that flavor.\n\n2003: The Grill, Ritz-Carlton Dearborn (hotel closed, 2010)\n\nExcellent service is never listed on a menu. It can not be artfully arranged on a plate, drizzled with chocolate or swirled in a wine glass. Service is that intangible, ephemeral part of the dining experience that sends us home with warm feelings and fond memories \u2014 or leaves us shaking our head in irritation or disappointment. \"Why can't anyone do something about poor service?\" we ask each other. It's not that most restaurants aren't trying. But delivering great service may be the most difficult part of a challenging business. It takes effort to build, and determination to maintain. And if it falters, as it so easily can, it takes courage to say, \"We are good, but good is not great.\"\n\n2002: Cuisine, Detroit\n\n\"When I'm in other cities, people say, 'Oh, Detroit. Those people don't know food \u2014 they won't support a place like that. They're a meat and potatoes kind of town.' But they used to say that about Chicago, too, 20 years ago, and look how many great restaurants are there now.\"\n\n2001: The Hill, Grosse Pointe Farms\n\nDining out has become such an integral part of our lives that what many of us long for in a restaurant \u2014 besides excellent food, service and value \u2014 is a place that feels like our own, whether we're celebrating an anniversary, lunching with friends or having dinner with a client. Crafting a menu, an atmosphere and a setting that will give guests that feeling has been their first priority.\n\n2000: Tribute, Farmington Hills (Closed 2009)\n\nFor many of the region's most influential business and industrial leaders, Tribute is a favorite haunt. For many other people, it is a once-a-year splurge. But for all who come, a meal here is never ordinary, and the welcome is always warm. It is, above all, a collection of people who know and love food \u2014 and who love sharing their enthusiasm.\n\nSend your dining tips to Free Press Restaurant Critic Mark Kurlyandchik at 313-222-5026 ormkurlyandc@freepress.com.
