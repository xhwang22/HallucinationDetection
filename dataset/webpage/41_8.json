Sign up here to get it in your inbox.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for evidence that the climate crisis is taking a toll, look no further than a new survey of Angelenos.\n\nFifty-one percent of Los Angeles County residents avoided going outside at some point between summer 2020 and summer 2021 because of concerns about breathing wildfire smoke, the University of Southern California survey found. More than one-quarter of Angelenos said they had suffered psychological distress due to a disaster such as a fire, flood or extreme heat during that time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHeat storms in particular are taking a toll on quality of life. Fifty-four percent of local residents said they had gone to a mall, library, community center or other cool location for the sole purpose of getting out of the heat \u2014 a startling number, at least to me.\n\nRising temperatures don\u2019t affect everyone equally. The survey found that 27% of Black Angelenos work outdoors with no cover, much more than any other racial group. And whereas 62% of white survey respondents said their neighborhoods have enough trees to provide adequate shade for walking on a hot, sunny day, only 51% of Latino, Asian and Black residents said the same.\n\nOverall, more than three-quarters of respondents said climate change is a threat to the well-being of Angelenos.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see what\u2019s giving people that idea. Los Angeles County recorded a record-high 121-degree temperature during an excruciating heat wave in summer 2020, following a decade in which heat killed an estimated 3,900 Californians, with the death count rising over time, according to an L.A. Times investigation. Southern California officials have issued air quality advisories due to wildfire smoke on 17 days so far this year \u2014 and 55 days last year, when the Bobcat fire raged in the San Gabriel Mountains.\n\nKelly Sanders, an energy and climate expert at USC who was not involved with the survey, told me it\u2019s more than wildfires to blame for filling the air with smoke and keeping people indoors. California is in drought \u2014 and lack of rainfall not only primes the landscape for fire but also allows lung-damaging particles to linger in the air longer. High temperatures, too, can exacerbate smog.\n\nAll those forces \u2014 heat, drought, wildfires, air pollution \u2014 are made worse by the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nSanders pointed to the growing number of Californians who have experienced ash falling out of the sky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a one-off \u2014 it\u2019s happening every year, multiple times a year at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always talk about these apocalyptic events in the future, but ash falling out of the sky \u2014 it doesn\u2019t get more apocalyptic than that.\u201d\n\nAsh falls on a parked car as the Bobcat fire burns in the distance in September 2020. (Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe USC survey offers reasons for hope, too. I was encouraged that 40% of Angelenos say their next car is likely to be electric. (I wasn\u2019t one of the 1,244 people to take the survey, but I would have said the same.) Large majorities of Angelenos also try to limit their electricity and water use, the amount of time they spend driving and how much meat they eat \u2014 all good for the climate.\n\nInterestingly, older people were more likely to say their individual actions can make a difference in tackling global warming \u2014 a sign that younger generations, such as my own, are fed up with decades of inaction by corporations and government and are sick of being told their lifestyles are to blame. Fifty-seven percent of survey respondents ages 18 to 39 said their actions can make a difference, compared with 75% of respondents in their 40s, 71% in their 50s and 65% age 60 and older.\n\nYounger people \u201chave a different idea about who are the humans that are causing climate change,\u201d said Kyla Thomas, director of the LABarometer survey at the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research, which conducted the polling.\n\nOne other key finding: Just 17% of Angelenos said local government is doing enough to fight climate change.\n\nTo be fair, I don\u2019t know of any local government that\u2019s truly doing enough, given the science showing that global emissions need to be cut roughly in half in less than a decade. But it\u2019s not hard to point to places where Los Angeles is falling short. Just to offer one example from my previous reporting, the city still doesn\u2019t have a plan for reducing planet-warming emissions from residential gas heating and gas stoves, despite Mayor Eric Garcetti setting targets for net-zero-carbon buildings way back in April 2019.\n\nGarcetti did join with three City Council members this week to introduce a motion instructing L.A.\u2019s climate emergency office to develop recommendations for slashing emissions from gas appliances in homes, with a focus on affordability. Environmental justice activists have raised concerns that requiring electric heating and cooking could raise energy and housing costs.\n\nThe new initiative \u201cwill ensure that the people who are most impacted by climate change and housing insecurity are the ones leading the conversation, and that the solutions proposed lead to strong labor, housing, and health protections,\u201d said Martha Dina Arg\u00fcello, executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility-Los Angeles, in a written statement.\n\nDiane McLindon and her dog, Frankie, try to stay cool in their trailer in Desert Hot Springs. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)\n\nShifting from gas cooking to induction stoves will be especially important as wildfire smoke and higher temperatures force people to spend even more time sheltered at home with the windows closed, Sanders said. That\u2019s because cooking with gas can lead to high levels of indoor air pollution. And gas stoves aren\u2019t the only problem \u2014 the air outside has a big effect on the air inside.\n\n\u201cWe need to focus more on improving our homes and buildings to promote safe indoor air quality, as well as access to adequate air conditioning. People are spending a lot more time at home,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cCommunities living closer to pollution sources like highways, wildfires, industrial centers, the ports \u2014 they\u2019re really disproportionately impacted by this poor air quality.\u201d\n\nYou can check out the detailed survey results here. They\u2019ve really got me thinking about how many politicians still talk about climate change as a problem to be solved for the sake of future generations, as opposed to a disaster that is here now and making the planet progressively less livable for current generations. President Biden, for instance, recently pitched his \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d legislation by describing the fight against global warming as an \u201cobligation to our children and to our grandchildren.\u201d\n\nThat attitude is admirable but behind the times. We live in a world where large and growing numbers of people are staying indoors to protect their lungs from wildfire smoke, going to the mall to stay cool and feeling anxiety from climate calamity.\n\nIf the survey says anything, it says people want action, and they want it now.\n\nHere\u2019s what else is happening around the West:\n\nTOP STORIES\n\nAn aerial view of Mammoth Mountain from above Mammoth Creek on Oct. 27. (Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times)\n\nCalifornia\u2019s biggest source of water supply \u2014 the Sierra Nevada snowpack \u2014 could be close to zero for five straight years as soon as the 2040s, new research finds. Here\u2019s the story by my colleague Hayley Smith, which speaks to the critical importance of using water more carefully. And as scary as conditions might get in a few decades, they\u2019re already bad now. Just 6% of the contiguous U.S. was covered in snow as of Friday, the lowest coverage since researchers started tracking that figure, according to AccuWeather\u2019s Mark Puleo. There\u2019s so little powder in the Rocky Mountains that one Colorado ski town is holding a four-day \u201csnow dance\u201d to ask Ullr, the Norse God of Snow, to please help them out, the Associated Press\u2019 Thomas Peipert and Brittany Peterson report.\n\nPresident Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d bill includes the largest-ever federal investment in U.S. forests \u2014 $27 billion overall, with $14 billion for fuels reduction to limit wildfire severity. This would mark a sea change from the current approach of throwing tons of money at firefighting and neglecting prevention, The Times\u2019 Jennifer Haberkorn reports. Here in California, meanwhile, Pacific Gas & Electric has agreed to pay $125 million for sparking the Kincade fire, Gregory Yee reports. And in fire news of a different kind, local officials say the awful smell in the city of Carson was caused by a warehouse fire ignited by illegally stored flammable materials, including hand sanitizer and antibacterial wipes, Hailey Branson-Potts and Andrew J. Campa report.\n\nAs part of a settlement agreement with environmental groups, a massive home development at Tejon Ranch in northern L.A. County won\u2019t have natural gas hookups. Instead, homes will be built with electric heat pumps and induction stoves; details here from my colleague Louis Sahag\u00fan. At the same time, many Tejon Ranch residents will probably drive several hours each day commuting to and from Los Angeles, spewing carbon into the atmosphere. State lawmakers have tried to reduce emissions (and make housing more affordable) by promoting density, but some cities are racing to restrict new housing ahead of a law that would require them to allow duplexes and fourplexes in single-family neighborhoods, The Times\u2019 Liam Dillon reports. L.A.\u2019s City Council overwhelmingly opposed that law, despite new polling from The Times showing a strong majority of voters support the idea.\n\nDROUGHT CENTRAL\n\nIt looks like California will again mandate water-saving measures such as not watering lawns after it rains, with $500 fines for noncompliance. In the meantime, conservation is ticking up \u2014 Californians cut their water use by 13.2% in October, up from 3.9% in September, Hayley Smith reports for The Times. Out in the desert, Cadiz Inc. has pitched its plan to pump groundwater and ship it to coastal cities as a drought solution \u2014 but the Biden administration isn\u2019t buying it. Officials are trying to reverse a Trump administration decision clearing the way for the Cadiz pipeline, which has long been opposed by critics as an environmentally damaging water grab, my colleagues Alex Wigglesworth and Ian James report. Columnist Michael Hiltzik was pleased by the federal government\u2019s change of course, writing of the Cadiz project, \u201cIt\u2019s time to bury it in the desert grave where it belongs.\u201d\n\nHiltzik also slammed a ballot initiative backed by agribusiness that could require California to spend $100 billion on water infrastructure, calling it \u201ca majestically cynical ploy being foisted on taxpayers by some of the state\u2019s premier water hogs.\u201d The ballot initiative could also help Poseidon Water get around the California Coastal Commission in its quest to build a seawater desalination plant in Huntington Beach, columnist Steve Lopez writes. In the Coachella Valley, meanwhile, water officials are basically shrugging their shoulders as developers make plans to build surf parks, Janet Wilson reports for the Desert Sun.\n\nA powerful new ocean and atmosphere simulator at UC San Diego could help unravel one of the biggest climate science mysteries \u2014 the role of clouds in slowing or speeding up global warming. Reporting for the San Diego Union-Tribune, Joshua Emerson Smith describes the simulator as \u201clike a giant aquarium \u2014 minus the fish but capable of growing a microscopic jungle of marine organisms.\u201d It\u2019s capable of generating \u201cnear hurricane-force winds at sub-zero temperatures,\u201d which is pretty wild.\n\nTHE ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nSurfers exit the water near San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station in October 2019. (Hayne Palmour IV / San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\nSouthern California Edison is tearing down the San Onofre nuclear plant, in a process expected to take eight years and cost $4.5 billion. The San Diego Union-Tribune\u2019s Rob Nikolewski has a detailed explainer on the teardown, with critics questioning whether Edison will manage it safely. In other nuclear news, the Biden administration is looking for communities that might want to store the nation\u2019s spent nuclear fuel. And President Biden\u2019s energy secretary said she might talk with California officials about extending the life of the state\u2019s last nuke, Diablo Canyon, Reuters\u2019 Timothy Gardner reports. Supporters of keeping the plant open past 2025 held a rally last weekend, Rachel Showalter reports for KCBX; see also my deep dive on Diablo from earlier this year.\n\nThe Interior Department has issued more onshore oil and gas drilling permits per month under President Biden than it did during any of President Trump\u2019s first three years in office. Here\u2019s the story from the Washington Post\u2019s Maxine Joselow. You may recall that last week in this newsletter I wrote about the Biden administration\u2019s slow pace of approving solar and wind farms on public lands, which makes for an interesting contrast. And although the timing is probably a coincidence, the day after that newsletter was published the federal Bureau of Land Management announced it\u2019s planning to lower the fees paid by solar and wind farms.\n\nDescendants of Japanese Americans whom the U.S. government imprisoned during World War II are outraged by plans for a wind farm within sight of the former Minidoka incarceration camp in Idaho. They say the massive towers would irrevocably alter the desolate and isolated landscape, part of which is preserved as a national historic site that allows people to understand what it felt like to be imprisoned there, Kylie Mohr reports for High Country News. In a similar controversy in Colorado, there\u2019s opposition to a plan for transmission lines to facilitate clean energy within a few miles of Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site, where hundreds of Native Americans were killed by the U.S. Cavalry in 1864, Kevin Simpson reports for the Colorado Sun.\n\nAROUND THE WEST\n\nInvasive cheatgrass is displacing sagebrush and other native vegetation in the Great Basin faster than people are chopping down trees in the Amazon. That\u2019s according to new research finding that cheatgrass and similar nonnative plants now cover one-fifth of the Great Basin, Brianna Randall writes for Science News. It\u2019s making wildfires worse, and global warming is at least partly to blame, by allowing cheatgrass to outcompete native grasses at higher elevations where it wasn\u2019t previously viable.\n\nThere are so many bison in Yellowstone National Park \u2014 5,400 after they were hunted nearly to extinction a century ago \u2014 that they\u2019re causing overgrazing and hurting other species. The National Park Service will allow 900 bison to be killed or otherwise removed, Eduardo Medina reports for the New York Times. Yellowstone is just one example of a tension playing out across Western landscapes over the role of bison and wild horses, Indigenous stewardship, cattle ranching, the legacy of colonization and the meaning of \u201cwilderness,\u201d a topic that Stephen Lezak explores beautifully in this piece for High Country News.\n\nHollywood helped make Los Angeles what it is today \u2014 and so did oil. \u201cOil, motion pictures and real estate were like the trifecta of forces that were attracting migrants to come west to L.A. Oil was kind of right up there with the glamor of Hollywood,\u201d one expert told my colleague Rachel Schnalzer, in the latest entry in our series answering reader questions about local business. While oil brought wealth and jobs for some, there were also safety hazards for workers, many of whom died falling into oil tanks.\n\nONE MORE THING\n\nDisney Chief Executive Bob Chapek poses with Minnie Mouse. (Kin Cheung / Associated Press)\n\nAs I\u2019ve mentioned in previous newsletters, I\u2019m a huge Disney fan. So it definitely caught my attention that Walt Disney Co.\u2019s incoming head of public relations, Geoff Morrell, is currently an executive at the oil and gas giant BP. As Disney\u2019s chief corporate affairs officer, Morrell will also oversee environmental issues, Kim Masters and Alex Weprin write for the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAt some point, I\u2019ll write more about the intersection of Disney and climate.

His shaggy blond hair fit the Venice artist stereotype, as did his predilection for wearing kilts and going shirtless. He tried busking and selling the paintings he made, but most of his income sources dried up once the pandemic hit. When he moved to Thatcher, he built a two-story structure out of plywood. It had a door with a lock. He hung his paintings on the outside and chatted with his housed neighbors as they walked by on their way to the bike path. \u201cI never would have dreamed that I would be able to do this and have the freedom to just be this creative and show my art to as many people,\u201d Tyrell said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got to figure out a way to get my credit cards back, because I\u2019m basically bankrupt.\u201d\n\nBy the end of the month, residents of the encampment were packing up. Gene Siegrist, the housed neighbor who spearheaded the landscaping at Thatcher, says he paid some of them $50 to leave. One unhoused man, who was rumored to be running a bicycle chop shop, told me that several security guards from the large apartment complex across the street had warned them they would be fined or arrested if anyone was still living on the street by nightfall. That was threat enough to move elsewhere.\n\nBut Tyrell dug in his heels. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked to leave and harassed ever since I got here,\u201d he told me. \u201cI got beat up on Monday, but thankfully it wasn\u2019t bad enough that I had to go to the hospital.\u201d He showed me scratches and bruises near his ribs. \u201cI don\u2019t have anywhere to go, so I\u2019m just going to stay here,\u201d he said. A week later neighbors planted more yucca and laid out more gravel. By Halloween, Tyrell\u2019s refusal to leave had become a hot-button issue on the social-media platform Nextdoor. Siegrist posted several pictures of Tyrell\u2019s structure. Another neighbor suggested reporting it to Bonin\u2019s office. To that, Siegrist replied: \u201cDon\u2019t waste your time with that idiot. He caused this entire mess.\u201d\n\nOne night in March, city workers fenced off the Echo Park Lake section in the Echo Park neighborhood, on the other side of Los Angeles, and forcibly relocated hundreds of unhoused people. The episode drew national attention and prompted widespread protests throughout the city. Some imagined that Los Angeles might finally do something about its homeless problem. But in Venice, others wondered if the same harsh tactics could be used to clear the encampments on Third Avenue, Hampton and the boardwalk, near the beach, where 250 or so unhoused residents were living.\n\nOn June 7, Venice Beach served as backdrop and example when the councilman Joe Buscaino chose the boardwalk as the place to kick off his campaign for the mayoral election in 2022. Ryavec stood behind him, along with 75 or so supporters. Some held signs. \u201cBeaches and parks are sacred,\u201d a few said. \u201cSave us Joe,\u201d said others. Just as Buscaino finished speaking, a teenager who camps on the boardwalk and goes by the single name Angel was detained by the police after she was seen with a knife. Someone in the crowd later told The Los Angeles Times that she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to start killing people.\u201d But while she was being handcuffed, Angel explained that the knife was for protection and to slice fruit. Buscaino, whisked away by private security, later released a news release: \u201cThis is exactly why I was in Venice Beach today, charting a new course for our city, and I am convinced, now more than ever, that bold action is needed to make our city safer for everyone.\u201d Angel, 19, was let go the same day as her arrest. \u201cI\u2019m trying to figure out what kind of power we have,\u201d she told me, when I asked what she would do if the boardwalk encampment was razed. \u201cI really don\u2019t want to get pushed off,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us need support and direction, but not to just get swept up. We ended up in Venice for a reason: because we can be ourselves here.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://boomcalifornia.org/2021/02/04/south-central-is-home-race-and-the-power-of-community-investment-in-los-angeles/", "page_content": "Claudia Sandoval\n\nWhat makes a space a home? While we often think of it as the site for the nuclear family, home is also the space that communities create. In this sense, cities and neighborhoods evolve in much the same way as singular households. Individuals make a community their own by ensuring that the area reflects the needs and identity of its residents. Yet, as gentrification grows throughout many U.S. cities, marginalized communities are being stripped of the very essence that made these spaces home to its members. The anger over the loss of these spaces takes many people by surprise, even as others view the transition of their communities as a marker of progress. However, one loses the rich history of how these cities and spaces became home to millions of individuals in the face of structural divestment, disinterest, and overall erasure.\n\nThrough a historical analysis, Abigail Rosas discusses the ways in which a marginalized community, like South Central, California, became home to the thousands of Black and Latinx residents that have migrated to California since the 1960s. It is a beautifully written narrative of the work that Black and Latinx residents put into a community to make it their home. And it is ultimately a plea against gentrification\u2019s displacement of Black and Brown bodies.\n\nTo contextualize and ground the project, one has to remember that the United States is quickly becoming a minority-majority nation. Most research continues to focus on the white population as representative of the average American, while rendering the life and experiences of other groups as marginal. According to a 2015 Census report, more than half of the U.S. population is projected to belong to a minority group by 2060, with Black and non-Black Latinx groups accounting for almost 43% of the population.[1] This is precisely why research that focuses on Black and Latinx communities is not simply a one-off project, but instead represents the future of the United States and is the reason why the importance of South Central is Home extends well beyond the borders of California.\n\nRosas shapes her historical analysis by grounding the discussion around ideas of place-making, community-building, and race relations in South Central, Los Angeles (or South L.A., as it is now known). From beginning to end, the book eloquently narrates the ways in which African Americans began their place-making journey to South L.A. in the 1960s, against a backdrop of systemic racial oppression and racial covenants that segregated Black communities. In their journey from the U.S. South, Black residents migrated to the Southwest with the hope of starting anew, in a community whose history was not bogged down with the burdens of slavery.\n\nMexican and Central American immigrants began moving into the predominantly Black South Central neighborhood in the 1980s. Many of these immigrants left for economic and/or political motives in search of a more decent life. However, like African Americans, Central American and Mexican immigrants were relegated to the same \u201cforgotten places\u201d of the city.[2] Rosas contextualizes the environment in which Black and Latin American peoples would come to make South Central their home. More importantly, it provides the historical background in which these residents came together to advocate for their own community and well-being, often against the interests of powerful government entities. As Rosas puts it, \u201cSouth Central African American and Latina/o residents advocate for investment and care for the community, but an investment that would not leave them behind.\u201d It is through this collaboration that Rosas identifies the power of relational community formation.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Abigal Rosas\n\nMural By: Imelda Carrasco, Edwin Cuatiacuatl, Tevin Brown, Florinda Pascual, Karen Vega, Antonia Rivera, Brayana Harris, Jasmonz Bron, Raul Lopez, Fransico Aquila, Alex Truatisky, Jennifer Roman, Manny Velazquez\n\nThe seven chapters in this book can be broken down into three important categories: place-making, investment, and race relations. Impressively, Rosas situates the historical realities of Black and Latina/o/x residents in South Central. Within these historical accounts, Rosas intertwines the ways in which systems of oppression and racialization created the conditions in which these residents were required to maintain and preserve a community that would serve the needs of its members. Even when it comes to government investment initiatives like the Head Start program and healthcare clinics, it was the community members themselves that had to work together to make the programs fit the needs of the people in South Central.\n\nIn the chapters dedicated to Head Start and healthcare clinics, Rosas effectively captures how the programs were first rolled out, the difficulties encountered, and the way in which Black and Latina/o/x folks worked together to make both institutions a success. Interestingly, while both the Head Start program and Drew King Hospital were funded through important government initiatives, both instances of investment were often used to racialize the community through the insidious narrative of a culture of poverty. By interacting with and attempting to shape these spaces Black and Latinx residents were forced to interact with each other.\n\n\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Abigal Rosas\n\nMural by Xolotl Kristy Sandoval Joseph Dias\n\nWhile Rosas demonstrates the power that Black and Latinx communities have when they work together, she also brings up two important points that are not fleshed out in their entirety: the erasure of the Latinx community and negative race relations. As she notes on many occasions, the increased immigrant presence in South Los Angeles has done little to \u201cerode the African American identity and character the people readily associate with the area.\u201d[3] Rosas worries that the Latino and Latinx presence will be erased from the popular image of South L.A.. While I do not think Rosas suggests that the Latino and Latinx experience is more precarious than the Black experience, Rosas could have spent more time explaining the persistent association of South L.A. with African Americans. In other words, thinking about the ways in which understanding South L.A. as a Black community, even if demographic numbers tell us otherwise, is also about the importance of place-making for a community whose history in the United States is founded on the erasure of its people. Rosas\u2019 focus on the positive aspects of Black-Latinx relations is noteworthy. However, understanding why they do not always get along is just as important as highlighting when they do.\n\nPhoto Courtesy of Abigal Rosas\n\nMural by Xolotl Kristy Sandoval Joseph Dias\n\nSouth Central is Home will be of interest to sociologists, political scientists, historians, and ethnic studies scholars, among others. As a book that centers race relations in communities of color, this book would be especially useful for undergraduate and graduate students, community organizers, and even political leaders. For young scholars, it provides a model for writing about communities that formed us, communities that we unapologetically love. Many traditional scholars continue to view scholarship that center ones community or family as \u201cme-search\u201d. This critique of course is rarely made of white scholars researching white communities. Lastly, by disentangling the rich history of South Central, Rosas shows us the future of cities across the United States.\n\nClaudia Sandoval is a professor in the Political Science department at Loyola Marymount University where she teaches courses on Race, Immigration, and Black/Latina/o relations.

Link was residing in his car for a while last year. That cat resides in Lianne\u2019s home. I wish I could reside in Seattle. Savannah resides now in Australia. Pete and Lisa decided to reside in their motorhome, while traveling the country.\n\nWhen looking at those examples, note two different things. First, the meaning is that the expression \u201cReside In\u201d relates always to a place where people (or animals, like Lianne\u2019s cat) live.\n\nSecond, we\u2019re just indicating a space, a general area \u2013 such as a city, a car, a country, for example. In those instances, \u201cReside In\u201d makes sense and fits perfectly (although some might consider the verb \u201cto reside\u201d obsolete).\n\nReside On\n\n\u201cReside On\u201d is grammatically incorrect, and should be avoided. The preposition \u201cOn\u201d indicates flat surfaces, big or small. It doesn\u2019t relate to where people reside, and consequently it doesn\u2019t work well to try to use the form \u201cReside On\u201d.\n\nLet\u2019s see examples of how not to use \u201cReside On\u201d in a sentence, as well as some correct uses of \u201cOn\u201d:\n\nThe house I reside in lays on 5 acres of land. The book is on the table. Bob resides on that apartment building. (incorrect) Savannah resides now on Australia. (incorrect) The cat resides on Lianna\u2019s home. (incorrect)\n\nThe first sentence is my favorite, because it contains both examples we\u2019re looking for. It starts with \u201cthe house I reside in\u201d (which is correct, because I\u2019m indicating a general area, where I live).\n\nIt continues with telling it \u201clays on 5 acres of land\u201d. Land is considered fairly flat, and that\u2019s why we can use \u201clay on\u201d attached to it. The preposition \u201con\u201d correctly follows the verb \u201cto lay\u201d, in this case.\n\nEvery time we try to use \u201cReside On\u201d to indicate the place where a person lives, the sentence just becomes incorrect. You should never use it for that purpose.\n\nReside At\n\n\u201cReside At\u201d is a grammatically correct form, just like \u201cReside In\u201d. The preposition \u201cAt\u201d indicates a specific location. When pointing to the specific location a person \u201cResides At\u201d, this form makes sense and should be used.\n\nHere are some examples of \u201cReside At\u201d in a sentence:\n\nJoe resides at the yellow house down the road. Gabriel still resides at his parents\u2019 vacation house. I reside at 20, Blossom St. You shouldn\u2019t reside at the Isles Community anymore, it\u2019s dangerous. Do you reside at your office now? I never see you at home.\n\nLook closely at the examples. Note that each sentence points to a specific location that is unique: the yellow house, someone\u2019s vacation home or a community with a name aren\u2019t general areas or places.\n\nThe sentences in the examples provide very specific information as to where the individual resides.\n\nWhenever addressing a specific place, with an address or details that distinguish it from all general areas around, \u201cReside At\u201d is the form you should choose to use.\n\nWhich Is Used the Most?\n\nWhen talking about someone\u2019s residence, which of the three forms do people use more? Take a look at the graph from Google Ngram Viewer below, to see if people use more \u201cReside In\u201d, \u201cReside On\u201d or \u201cReside At\u201d.\n\nThe graph clearly shows that \u201cReside In\u201d is much more common. People use it with more frequency. It was to be expected, since this form refers to general locations, and has a broader usage. It didn\u2019t surprise us to see it popping up more than the others.\n\n\u201cReside On\u201d and \u201cReside At\u201d appear much less frequently. For \u201cReside On\u201d, we think it\u2019s because this is grammatically wrong form \u2013 so it may appear here and there, but definitely not too frequently. This is so, because it\u2019s simply wrong.\n\nAs for \u201cReside At\u201d, this form has a very specific use, to indicate a very specific location. The more specific an expression is, the less likely it is to pop up in sentences. That\u2019s why we can see \u201cReside At\u201d not being used as frequently as \u201cReside In\u201d.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWhen using the verb \u201cto reside\u201d, think about how specific the location you\u2019re indicating is, when choosing the form you\u2019ll use. Never use \u201cReside On\u201d. Use \u201cReside In\u201d when pointing to a general location (like a city, for example). And use \u201cReside At\u201d when indicating a specific, exact location."}, {"url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/interviews/jeff-dunham-on-whether-hed-release-a-straight-stand-up-special-without-puppets", "page_content": "Jeff Dunham is a very famous comedian/ventriloquist. Wait, or is it ventriloquist/comedian? Dunham himself doesn\u2019t even seem to know. With each of his comedy specials, before he starts bringing out his lineup of famed puppets, he does a solid chunk of straight stand-up comedy that sets up the rest of his show. This is when he can tell jokes about his family and personal life that his trunk full of characters later comment on tease him about. He usually gets a lot of laughs during this introduction segment, which has left me wondering whether or not he would consider a special only consisting of straight stand-up. Now we have our answer.\n\nI recently caught up with Dunham to discuss his new special Me The People. Given the fact that he\u2019s never released a true stand-up special in his 30+ years working in the entertainment business, I asked if it\u2019s something he\u2019d ever consider, and he responded with this:\n\nI'm a true believer in you dance with who brung you, and I don't think people are coming to see me just do stand-up. But I do enjoy doing it because you're right, a lot of the standup now sets up what goes on in the rest of the show\u2026 but no, I don't think I would ever do stand-up just by myself because the ventriloquism is what brought me to where I am. And I think the audience, that's what they're paying for.\n\nTruthfully, that response shows a level of self-awareness on the part of Dunham. After all, his characters have become just as famous as he is. Some would be more inclined to remember the names of Walter, Peanut and Jos\u00e9 Jalape\u00f1o before they remember the man bringing them to life. Not that all of his characters have been successes, as he recently told us about a few that left Dunham asking, \u201cWhat the hell was I thinking?\u201d Still, he has a way of creating charming little dummies that keep the audiences coming, and he would never deprive them of that.\n\nHe went on to tell an anecdote about none other than Pee-wee Herman himself, Paul Reubens, in order to further illustrate the importance of bringing out the puppets when people attend one of his shows:\n\nI remember in Dallas when Pee wee's Playhouse was huge, and I grew up in Dallas, but I was up at Baylor down South and I heard that he was at a comedy club and people were so upset because he just came as Paul Reubens and he didn't do the Pee-Wee character. And people were like, \u2018why do we even come see you?\u2019\n\nSo Dunham never forgot the Paul Reubens backlash and continues to apply what he learned with that situation to this day. Reubens seems to have learned from this himself, as he\u2019s still milking the character for all its worth, and is even currently shopping around a \u201cdark\u201d take on the character with the likes of the filmmakers behind Uncut Gems. When you have a character iconic enough that people break down the nuances between the film and television incarnations like folks do with Pee-wee, you\u2019re going to experience some pushback when leaving him out of a live show.\n\nDunham also has a cost-effective reason for doing a chunk of stand-up at the beginning of his acts, and it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t want to pay for an opener. He also said this:\n\nBut I also did it from an economic standpoint. Number one, I think I enjoy being on the road alone in my own tour bus... I didn't want to share my tour bus with an opening act, you know, I like my own space. So there was that. But there's also the economic part of it where I was paying these guys like a lot of money to open for me. And I'm like, \u2018wait a minute, I'm going up there doing 15, 20, 30 minutes of stand up myself. Why do I need an opening act?\u2019\n\nI mean\u2026 sure. Who wants to pay for an opening act? Jeff Dunham's stand-up has become such an effective part of his overall show that it\u2019s funny to think it started simply to save on costs and have a tour bus all to himself. Gabriel Iglesias recently told us that he had to pay a huge fine following his most recent special, so doing this stuff isn\u2019t at all cheap."}, {"url": "https://news.yahoo.com/los-angeles-running-time-solve-120045289.html", "page_content": "Los Angeles is running out of water, and time. Are leaders willing to act?\n\nThe Castaic Reservoir as seen from a helicopter on Sept. 28. The reservoir's total capacity is 104.3 billion gallons. (Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times)\n\nOn a clear afternoon recently, Mayor Eric Garcetti looked down at the Hollywood Reservoir from 1,200 feet in the air.\n\n\"It's as low as I can ever remember it being,\" Garcetti said of the reservoir from the back seat of a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power helicopter. \"You can see the bathtub ring.\"\n\nThe aerial survey of L.A.'s water infrastructure came at a critical moment. Over the last decade, the city has made significant investments in its future, including major projects to expand its ability to capture, store and recycle water. But now, on the eve of an election, much of the work remains unfinished \u2014 with target dates for some major water projects set as far as 2050.\n\nWith the city facing what is sure to be one of the hottest, driest and most challenging climate eras on record, it is essential that its next leader sees the work through to completion, Garcetti said.\n\n\"It's not an easy path, it's not a cheap path, but it's achievable,\" he said. \"And if he or she doesn't do it, we're in big trouble.\"\n\nBy now, it is clear that water independence is the best path forward for the 4 million residents of the city of Los Angeles, and for the county and region as a whole. Imported supplies from the State Water Project are heavily dependent on annual snowpack and rainfall in the Sierra, which are no longer a guarantee under the state's shifting climate regime. What's more, long-reliable federal supplies from the Colorado River are rapidly drying up, with the river's largest reservoir, Lake Mead, nearing dangerously low levels.\n\nIn certain ways, the city is in better shape than some other major metropolitan areas because of the Los Angeles Aqueduct system, two pipelines that deliver water from the Mono Basin and Owens River hundreds of miles away. But even that supply \u2014 much of it secured by stealth and deception more than 100 years ago \u2014 is heavily reliant on Sierra snowmelt.\n\n\"The reality is most Angelenos, most people, haven't thought about water their entire lives because it's been reliable,\" said Evelyn Cortez-Davis, director of water engineering and technical services at the DWP. But as the helicopter zoomed over the area's drought-dried hills and heat-sapped reservoirs, the urgency of the work came clearly into focus.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti, surveying L.A.'s water infrastructure from a helicopter, says he hopes his successor will see the city's many water projects through to completion. (Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times)\n\nGarcetti said that neither of the two candidates seeking to replace him has reached out to discuss the city's water goals. However, in emails to The Times, both Rep. Karen Bass and Rick Caruso said they believed Los Angeles must reduce its reliance on imported water.\n\nBass, who helped pass a major overhaul of the state's water system in 2009, said her top water priority as mayor would be modernizing aging infrastructure. She also said she would focus on ensuring the quality of drinking water for the city's residents, noting that communities of color are often hit hardest by environmental inequities.\n\n\"There\u2019s no one solution \u2014 but by choosing a strategic balance, with investments in strategies like water conservation, landscape transformation, rainwater capture, groundwater recharge, and the protection of our imported supplies, we will ensure a more sustainable water future,\" Bass wrote. She added that \"there is more we can do to reduce our reliance on imported water, which begins with more aggressive conservation measures.\"\n\nCaruso, a former DWP commissioner, said the next few years are critical. He underscored the need for more efficient water use and said water recycling and groundwater recharge would be his top priorities.\n\n\"Drought impacts all of us, and we must work collectively to reduce our water usage while working to quickly and efficiently expand our groundwater recharge and recycling efforts,\" Caruso wrote. He said he would \"work diligently to expand the use of recycled water for non-potable purposes and to ensure that all commercial and industrial users who want or need access to recycled water can achieve it easily \u2014 it won\u2019t happen quickly, but we must prioritize it.\"\n\nMost experts agree that wastewater recycling \u2014 or the capture and treatment of water for reuse \u2014 is among the most important steps for achieving greater self-reliance in Los Angeles. Currently, recycled water makes up only about 2% of the city's drinking water, but officials hope to one day see that amount at 35% or higher.\n\nThere are a few projects underway to help get there. For one, a direct potable reuse facility near the Headworks Reservoir, just north of Griffith Park, is expected to become the first facility in the state to put purified recycled water directly back into the drinking system, serving as proof of concept, officials said. It is slated to come online within the next five years.\n\nThe DWP also aims to recycle 100% of its available wastewater from the Donald C. Tillman water reclamation plant in Van Nuys, which will be used to replenish the San Fernando groundwater basin and will produce enough drinking water for more than 200,000 people each year. That project is slated for completion by 2027.\n\nBut perhaps most ambitious is the conversion of the massive Hyperion Water Reclamation Plant in Playa del Rey into an advanced water purification facility by 2035. The plant currently treats wastewater only enough to release it back into Santa Monica Bay, but when the work is completed, it will produce enough water for 2 million people.\n\n\"It will dwarf everything else,\" Garcetti said of the project.\n\nAn aerial view of the Van Norman reservoir complex in Granada Hills. A project at the complex will include the construction of an ultraviolet light treatment facility on the outlet of the Los Angeles Reservoir. (Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times)\n\nGregory Pierce, co-director of the Luskin Center for Innovation at UCLA, said Los Angeles is \"somewhat of a leader\" when it comes to water recycling, and that Hyperion may be the DWP's \"largest investment since the Mulholland days.\"\n\nThe project \"is a little bit late, obviously, but I think it will be early enough to avoid complete disaster in terms of people actually running out of water, and having to ration much more radically than we are right now,\" he said.\n\nThe DWP is also focusing on improving its ability to capture and treat more stormwater before it escapes to the sea. Though the county passed Measure W, legislation to help bolster some of that work, a Times review earlier this year found that officials had been slow to dole out funds.\n\nThere has been some progress, however, including the enhancement of a spreading grounds facility in Tujunga, which collects stormwater and infiltrates it into the San Fernando Valley groundwater basin in a process known as recharge. The project has doubled the facility's ability to capture stormwater from 8,000 acre-feet per year to 16,000 \u2014 or roughly 5 billion gallons, Cortez-Davis said.\n\nIn his email, Caruso said he wanted to see L.A. County's efforts on stormwater capture and recycling \"much more aligned and in congruence with City efforts,\" and that both entities should mandate that more projects use graywater and recycled water for non-potable purposes.\n\nBass said that she would partner with the DWP on infrastructure and landscape programs to \"make sure we capture every drop\" and that she would \"expedite the stormwater capture projects that were made possible by Measure W.\"\n\nBut part of the challenge when it comes to L.A.'s groundwater is pollution, including portions of the San Fernando Valley groundwater basin that were declared Superfund sites after chemicals seeped into the aquifer from industrial disposal and storage pits decades ago.\n\nCortez-Davis said the DWP is moving forward with remediation efforts after years of being stuck in legal limbo waiting for responsible parties to take ownership of the pollutants. Among other steps, the treatment includes pumping water and disinfecting it with ultraviolet light and activated carbon, she said.\n\nPierce said San Fernando Valley groundwater has long been an untapped resource in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It used to be way too expensive and we had cheaper options [than remediation],\" he said. \"But now it's finally here because there are no cheaper options, and because the technology has gotten there, so I think now is the time. DWP has already begun cleaning that up, and that's going to be really useful for the city.\"\n\nHe also underscored that current conservation efforts should become permanent in the face of water uncertainty. So far, Angelenos have more than risen to the challenge \u2014 achieving record-low demand in June, July and August this year, according to the DWP.\n\nCortez-Davis noted that the city has kept its water use at roughly 1970 levels despite growing by more than a million people since then.\n\nTracts of homes in Porter Ranch appear brownish gray in an aerial view as residents have greatly reduced watering their lawns. (Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times)\n\nBut water is only one of many issues facing the residents of Los Angeles. Garcetti said he tends to think of the city's challenges as \"short, medium and long-term,\" with issues such as COVID-19 and public safety in the \"short-term\" category and housing and homelessness in the \"medium-term\" category.\n\n\"But long-term is climate. It is the one crisis that won't go away in our lifetime,\" he said.\n\nAmong other plans, Bass said she wanted to update the open space element of the city's General Plan to make parks and open areas into \"water resilient places\" that can capture stormwater and naturally recharge groundwater basins.\n\n\"This is an existential crisis that will take all of us to do our part, and we will need the support of the federal and state governments to undertake the big projects that will be necessary to build water self-reliance in L.A.,\" she said.\n\nCaruso said expanding the city's network of recycling water pipes for non-industrial and commercial uses, including irrigation, would \"significantly reduce our water usage as a region.\"\n\n\"There are many cities around the world that manage drought effectively and efficiently, and we must work aggressively to adapt to climate change and its impacts on our society,\" he said.\n\nBoth Bass and Caruso said they wanted to help Angelenos continue to transition toward more efficient water use practices and drought-tolerant landscaping.\n\nThe Encino Reservoir serves as an emergency water supply for Los Angeles. (Hayley Smith / Los Angeles Times)\n\nGarcetti said he believes either candidate will be able to see the city's water goals through to completion \u2014 so long as they stay the course.\n\n\"I have high confidence that, as long as they don't undo it, they'll be able to execute,\" he said. But as the helicopter whirred back toward the DWP rooftop in downtown L.A., he also acknowledged that nearly 10 years as mayor taught him that things don't always go as planned.\n\n\"You come in as mayor and you feel like Superman, like anything is possible,\" he said. \"But the city will do what the city will do, and Mother Nature will do what Mother Nature will do, so there is humility.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/hot-property/la-fi-hotprop-cheryl-hines-robert-kennedy-malibu-house-20170216-story.html", "page_content": "Actress Cheryl Hines and her husband, attorney-activist Robert F.
