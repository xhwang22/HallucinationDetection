{"Gia Marie Carangi was featured on the cover of Vogue and Cosmopolitan.": [{"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/gia-carangi", "page_content": "After moving to New York in 1977, Gia Carangi became one of the most sought-after models in fashion and a fixture of Studio 54 \u2014 but her life quickly unraveled.\n\nOn the surface, Gia Carangi seemed to have it all. In the late 70s and 80s, Carangi owned the spotlight and had droves of adoring fans.\n\nIt\u2019s said that she added the \u201csuper\u201d in supermodel to describe how exponentially successful she had been in her career. Known for an edgy personality and a smoldering stare, the world was Carangi\u2019s catwalk.\n\nBut the very attitude and wild side of America\u2019s first supermodel which made Gia Carangi so desirable also made her a great danger to herself. This would be her undoing.\n\nGia Carangi\u2019s Early Life\n\nGia Marie Carangi was born on January 29, 1960, in Philadelphia to an Italian-American father, Joseph, who owned a tiny restaurant called Hoagie City. Her mother, Kathleen Carangi, was a homemaker.\n\nCarangi\u2019s parents separated in 1971. Those close to Carangi, including herself, have admitted that this divorce had a lasting impact on her attitude.\n\nHer two brothers, both older than her, moved out and lived with their mom while Carangi stayed with her father. She spent her summers behind his counter, attending concerts like your run-of-the-mill high schooler.\n\nIt was in the summer of 1978 that a local photographer and hairdresser, Maurice Tannenbaum, asked the dark-haired beauty to pose on the dance floor after spotting her at a local nightclub. Carangi\u2019s dark, tomboyish looks, 34-24-35 measurements, and perfect face were an ideal match for the fashion world which at the time was overrun with willowy blondes.\n\nTannenbaum passed on Carangi\u2019s photos to legendary New York department store Bloomingdale\u2019s photographer, Arthur Elgort. Before Carangi knew it, she was the talk of New York.\n\n\u201cI started working with very good people,\u201d Gia Carangi confided in a 1983 interview. \u201cI mean all the time, very fast. I didn\u2019t build into a model. I just sort of became one.\u201d\n\nA Meteoric Rise To Fame\n\nGia Carangi\u2019s first photoshoot at the Philadelphia nightclub, back when she was just 16, was the beginning of her meteoric rise to stardom, and life only moved faster once she moved to New York.\n\nCarangi signed with Wilhelmina Cooper, a legendary fashion agent and owner of her own modeling agency. Wilhelmina became a kind of mother figure to Carangi.\n\nFrancesco Scavullo, a leading fashion photographer of the day and who would become a personal friend of Carangi\u2019s, gushed of her:\n\n\u201cThere was something she had\u2026 no other girl has got it. I\u2019ve never met a girl who had it. She had the perfect body for modeling: perfect eyes, mouth, hair. And, to me, the perfect attitude: \u2018I don\u2019t give a damn.'\u201d\n\nThat attitude proved to be both what was so enticing and dangerous about Carangi.\n\nHer androgynous look was in part due to her sexuality. Described in some instances as aggressive and others as vulnerable, Carangi seemed to have a need to be loved \u2014 and mostly by women.\n\nThose who had worked with her said it wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to fall in love with the models she shot with. On a shoot for photographer Chris von Wangenheim, which would become wildly popular, Carangi posed nude up against a fence with makeup artist and model Sandy Linter.\n\nThe two would embark on a passionate though unrequited love affair.\n\nIndeed, Gia Carangi appeared insatiable both in her love life and in her recreational drug use. As a teen, she was already hooked on marijuana, cocaine, and quaaludes.\n\nCarangi went on to model for Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Diane Von Furstenberg, Cutex, Lancetti, Levi\u2019s, Maybelline, Vidal-Sassoon, and Yves Saint Laurent \u2014 to name a few. At the age of 18, Carangi was making $100,000 a year. It was more than any other model at the time, leading many fashion historians to dub her the world\u2019s first supermodel.\n\nShe then landed on the covers of Vogue and Cosmo starting in 1979.\n\n\u201cA model has to create moods,\u201d Carangi said of her talent, \u201cYou have to be careful not to get stuck in a mood \u2013 emotions have trends just like fashion \u2026 I become what ever your eye wants to see. It\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nBut Gia Carangi remained hard to control. Though it was her edgy attitude that drew people to her, Carangi was also tough to work with. A diva by age 18, she would walk off shoots if she wasn\u2019t feeling it, or would cancel weeks of work if she didn\u2019t like her haircut.\n\nCarangi would chow down on barbecue chicken while wearing a dress worth thousands of dollars. She was also transparent about her drug use, discussing it openly in interviews and partying often with other stars and socialites at Studio 54.\n\nBut there was also a deep loneliness in her, returning to her apartment alone after work, and constantly searching for love. \u201cI am finally really starting to dig being different. Maybe I am discovering who I am. Or maybe I\u2019m just stoned again,\u201d she admitted.\n\nGia Carangi Backslides Into Drugs\n\nThe supermodel would go from a $10,000 photo shoot to a \u201cshooting gallery\u201d, or seedy locale where one can shoot up heroin, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side.\n\nIn 1980, Wilhelmina died and sent Carangi into a spiral. Already using heroin, the supermodel delved deeper into her habit. During a shoot that year for Vogue with famed portrait photographer Richard Avedon, Carangi escaped through a window. Though incensed, the magazine gave her a second chance at the shoot, but when the pictures came back they revealed track marks and red bumps all over the model\u2019s arms.\n\nIn 1981, she was arrested for driving under the influence of a narcotic.\n\nIn May of that same year, 21-year-old Carangi needed to get hand surgery because \u201cshe had injected herself in the same place so many times that there was an open infected tunnel leading into her vein,\u201d her biographer Stephen Fried documented.\n\nFor her final Cosmo cover photo in early 1982, fashion photographer Scavullo covered up the track marks on her arms by having her put her hands behind her back. The dress she wore was poofy enough to cover up the scars of her habit. The model also angled her face to cover up the bloating.\n\nHer brother, Michael, recalled his little sister\u2019s behavior and laments: \u201cThe biggest mistake we made was that nobody went up there with her. She could\u2019ve used a friend.\u201d\n\nGia Carangi left her modeling agency, tried to stay afloat at another, but wound up returning home to Philadelphia to live with her mother at a final grasp at finding sobriety.\n\nAn Untimely Demise\n\nGia Carangi was blackballed from New York\u2019s agencies and although magazines gave her several last chances, the model could not pull herself together. One of her final shoots appeared in Vogue in 1982 and was photographed by Andrea Blanch.\n\nBy the end of that year, Carangi had become so volatile that she couldn\u2019t get booked for jobs. No one wanted to work with the wild child any longer.\n\nShe had a successful go at rehab for about a year following in Philadelphia. By this time she was broke and receiving rehabilitation from welfare.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9npRKUAeQZI\n\nMeanwhile, model Cindy Crawford came on the scene as a newer, more put together version of Gia. Crawford admitted to Playboy that many of her jobs came from those who loved Carangi and were hoping to replace her.\n\nIn the fall of 1986, Carangi was hospitalized. It became apparent that she had been sleeping outside in the rain and had been badly beaten up and raped. Blood tests showed she was suffering from AIDS-related complications.\n\nOn November 26, 1986, America\u2019s first supermodel died of those complications, though her mother was by her side.\n\nCarangi\u2019s meteoric and tumultuous career were immortalized in the HBO movie Gia that starred Angelina Jolie nearly a decade later in 1998. Jolie said of the model herself after portraying her, \u201cYou think, \u2018God, she didn\u2019t need drugs \u2014 she was a drug.'\u201d\n\nCarangi seemed to be somewhat cognizant of her brilliant, though short, career. She said forebodingly in an interview before her demise: \u201cModeling is a short gig.\u201d\n\nAfter this look at Gia Carangi, read about who some believe was America\u2019s first \u201cit\u201d girl, Audrey Munson. Then, take a look at the strange and sad story of the French fitness model who was killed by an exploding whipped cream can."}, {"url": "https://www.vintag.es/2023/03/gia-carangi-cosmopolitan-covers.html", "page_content": "Throughout her short career, she appeared in the pages of Harper\u2019s Bazaar and countless other fashion magazines, on the covers of the Italian, British and French editions of Vogue, and even the cover of the all-important, career-defining American Vogue. But her most important covers are her Cosmopolitan covers, each shot by famed photographer Francesco Scavullo (1921\u20132004), who exclusively shot the magazine covers for more than 30 years. Scavullo considered Gia a muse and featured her on five different Cosmopolitan covers between 1979 and 1982. She was, for a time, the ultimate Cosmo girl.\n\n\n\n\n\nGia first met Scavullo through makeup artist Way Bandy, who helped get her first test shoot with the photographer. Scavullo was quite taken with Gia: she didn\u2019t fit into any of the usual model categories. The session went well, and Scavullo booked her again two weeks later for a cover try. That session also went well, and the pictures had a good chance of being used. She got a voucher for the standard cover fee, which was $100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI was mad about her,\u201d Scavullo recalled. \u201cShe was very candid in front of the camera. She wasn\u2019t stylized, she didn\u2019t pose. She was like an actress in front of the camera. You got a million pictures that had her head in them. She had her own little way of modeling. She jumped around; you couldn\u2019t set your lights and you couldn\u2019t hold her still. You had to let her go, you couldn\u2019t direct her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut all that didn\u2019t matter, given what Gia brought to the shoot. \u201cWith most models who move around, you get bad stuff,\u201d Scavullo continued. \u201cWith her, you got wonderful stuff... It was like you got candid pictures of her and they were divine. There is something she had... no other girl has got it. I\u2019ve never met a girl who had it. She had the perfect body for modeling; perfect eyes, mouth, hair. And, to me, the perfect attitude.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at each of Gia\u2019s covers for Cosmo.\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 1979\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGia\u2019s first appearance on the cover of Cosmopolitan was the April 1979 cover, which featured a shot of the supermodel wearing a Lycra bodysuit. Editor Helen Gurley Brown normally preferred that Scavullo shoot 12 different models each year, but after seeing the results of this shoot, she immediately ordered another Gia cover.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cosmo cover was actually Gia\u2019s first major cover. A few weeks earlier, she had appeared on the April 1979 cover of the British edition of Vogue. Her first Cosmo cover sold spectacularly, as did the brown Norma Kamali unitard in which she appeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 1979\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGia\u2019s second Cosmopolitan cover was the July 1979 issue. Again shot by Scavullo, the memorable cover featured a sultry Gia wearing a yellow gravity-defying swimsuit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJanuary 1980\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn late December 1979, Gia appeared on the cover of Cosmopolitan wearing a purple cardigan that revealed much of Gia\u2019s \u201cbosom\u201d \u2013 as Scavullo would say. That same month, Gia also got her first magazine profile when she appeared on the cover of Philadelphia magazine\u2019s annual \u201cHot People To Watch\u201d issue. \u201cMeet Gia,\u201d the headline said. She was on her way to becoming a household name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 1980\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGia\u2019s career was at its peak at the beginning of 1980, but when her confidant and agent Wilhelmina Cooper died from lung cancer in March 1980, a devastated Gia began abusing drugs and developed an addiction to heroin. Scavullo remembered a session with her in the Caribbean when \u201cshe was crying, she couldn\u2019t find her drugs. I literally had to lay her down on her bed until she fell asleep.\u201d The Scavullo image of Gia wearing a brown swimsuit, used for the July 1980 cover of Cosmo, had been shot before Gia\u2019s drug habit began spiraling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApril 1982\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGia\u2019s last official appearance on the cover of Cosmopolitan \u2013 and what would be her last cover appearance for an American magazine \u2013 was the April 1982 issue of Cosmo. The cover was a gift from Scavullo in an attempt to help her jump-start her modeling comeback after a 21-day detox program, and a run-in with the police in March 1981. Unfortunately, her sobriety was short-lived. \u201cHe did that because he was a very kind man and he felt sorry for her,\u201d recalled Harry King, Gia\u2019s hairstylist on the shoot. \u201cScavullo had had people very close to him be involved with drugs before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the shoot, Gia wore a strapless Fabrice party dress, and posed with her hands tucked behind her. The camera angle was meant to minimize the bloating caused by the methadone Gia was taking to help treat her addiction to heroin and the weight gain from the sweets she was craving (makeup artist Way Bandy did what he could, too). The pose was designed to cover the gory abscess on her hand and it\u2019s also widely believed that Gia\u2019s arms were placed behind her to hide her track marks, though Scavullo maintained it was because Gia had put on weight and the pose made her look thinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nScavullo convinced Cosmo to use the shot of Gia for the cover of the 1982 issue. She was also interviewed inside for the magazine\u2019s \u201cThis Month\u2019s Cosmo Girl\u201d feature, which had recently been created to respond to the public\u2019s growing interest in fashion models.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.factinate.com/people/facts-gia-carangi/", "page_content": "Gia Carangi took the modelling industry by storm with her fearless, androgynous look and risk-taking sensibilities. Although she is widely considered to be the first supermodel, her early exposure to substances derailed her career right at the peak of her success. Gia\u2019s story is a cautionary tale\u2014one of heartbreak and regret\u2014and it only ends in tragedy.\n\n1. She Came From A Broken Family\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorn January 29, 1960, Gia Carangi had it rough right from the get-go. Her home life was violent and unstable, and when she was only 11 years old, her mother walked out on the family. After that, Gia didn\u2019t see her mother for years. She spent her youth in Philadelphia, working at her father\u2019s small restaurant and trying to forget her yearning for a maternal figure.\n\nBut this sense of loss never went away.\n\n2. She Marched To The Beat Of Her Own Drum\n\nGia found other meaningful connections in her friendships and was shamelessly open with her feelings. She often declared intentions of friendship with floral bouquets. No flowers for the boys though! Gia was all about the ladies. In high school, she pivoted from platonic girl crushes and began frequenting gay clubs, subverting gender norms every chance she got.\n\nHowever, Gia did have time for one man, and one man only\u2014her idol, David Bowie.\n\n3. She Looked Up To A Legend\n\nGia and her friends obsessed over Bowie\u2019s glam style, bisexuality, and playful gender subversion. Taking cues from the legendary musician, Gia adopted an androgynous style. She wore men\u2019s clothes\u2014army pants and combat boots\u2013and kept her hair cropped short and brightly dyed. But that wan\u2019t all. Gia was a barefaced beauty all the way through and never wore a stitch of makeup.\n\nWhile out at the clubs, she definitely stood out from the crowd.\n\n4. She Stood Out From The Crowd\n\nEveryone noticed Gia\u2014it was hard not to. She was a hip vision in her thrifted vintage wardrobe of men\u2019s castoffs, and her signature style was a striking contrast to her unadorned natural beauty. Instantly captivated by Gia at a club she frequented, a local shutterbug, Maurice Tannenbaum, asked to take her photograph on the dance floor. Before long, bold, confident, and self-assured Gia began to model in local advertisements.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t all the nightclubs had to offer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. She Was Gay and Proud\n\nWhen she was only 15 years old, Gia partied at the gay club DCA and set her eyes on a short and beautiful blonde girl named Sharon Beverly. She\u2019d actually briefly dated Beverly\u2019s brother, but in the end, her overwhelming attraction to Beverly won out. However, there was one caveat\u2014Beverly was quite a bit older than Gia and it was about to get her in a lot of trouble.\n\n6. She Was Too Young\n\nAlthough Kathleen Sperr wasn\u2019t especially close to her daughter Gia, it didn\u2019t stop her from laying down the law. After finding out about Gia\u2019s lesbian romance with Sharon, she immediately called up Sharon\u2019s parents and warned them that their daughter was far too old to be hanging out with Gia. Of course, this never stopped Gia from pursuing what she wanted\u2014whether it be a woman or a career or a bad decision.\n\n6. She Took A Chance\n\nWith some exposure and experience, Gia decided to see how far she could get with modelling. Like many before her, Gia\u2019s dreams and aspirations were bigger than the confines of her hometown. The bright lights and endless possibilities of New York City drew Gia to the pulsing metropolis. Only 17, and all on her own in an unfamiliar and strange city, Gia didn\u2019t have to wait long before being discovered.\n\nShe soon met a woman who would not only be her agent, and mentor, but also a dear friend. This was the maternal figure she had been searching for all along.\n\n7. She Was A Hit\n\nWhen Gia met Wilhelmina Cooper, one of the most successful models of the 1960s, everything changed. Although Cooper\u2019s career had been based on her icy, aristocratic look, she immediately recognized the edgy, blue-collar Gia as a new breed of model. After signing her on, Cooper took Gia under her wing, and before long, Gia herself had become a one-name wonder.\n\n8. She Got Her First Big Break\n\nThe first major shoot Gia booked was so chaotic and iconic it\u2019s still talked about to this day. In it, Gia climbed and posed against a chain link fence. And then she amped up the drama. She started shrugging out of her clothes, eventually shedding them all together. When another model joined her on set, the two of them took it to the next level.\n\nSign up to our newsletter.

She Was Obsessed With Her Makeup Artist\n\nOn the day of her infamous photoshoot, Gia had two costars. The first round of shots were taken with Lisa Vales, but for the second round, the photographer wanted to do something more personal and asked the makeup artist, Sandy Linter, to step in. That\u2019s when the magic really started happening. She and Gia had unbelievable chemistry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. She Bared All\n\nTogether, Gia and Vales turned up the heat, sharing steamy smouldering gazes through the wire, with only the fence between them. It was risky and fearless, and absolutely successful. The pictures are now part of fashion history and still have tongues wagging to this day. More than that, the snaps launched Gia\u2019s career into the stratosphere.\n\n11. She Became The First Supermodel\n\nThe photos caused a sensation, and in a short time Gia established herself within the modelling world. She began working with top fashion houses including haute couture heavyweights Versace, Armani, and Saint Laurent. But that wasn\u2019t all. She also booked coveted jobs as a cover girl for Paris and American Vogue. As Gia\u2019s star rapidly rose, there was one person she just couldn\u2019t get out of her head.\n\n12. She Shot Her Shot\n\nThe day after their steamy photoshoot, Gia put the moves on Linter, and asked her if she wanted a ride in her bright red sports car. Linter went along with it and soon after, things started getting serious. After her busy work days, 19-year-old Gia didn\u2019t want to spend the rest of her night alone in an empty apartment. With Linter, she found companionship\u2014a balm to her ever growing sense of isolation.\n\n13. She Fell In Love\n\nGia and Linter loved one another deeply and while Linter has since admitted that it wasn\u2019t a \u201ctorrid love affair,\u201d these two girls certainly shared a special connection. They spent most of their time together. There were flowers, restaurants, and wild nights out at the clubs, but most importantly, there was the mutual feeling of being understood.\n\nBut this comfortable relationship was never destined for \u201chappily ever after.\u201d\n\n14. She Was Intensely Lonely\n\nPeople described Gina as a loner, but those closest to her claimed the opposite was true. When it came to her relationship with Linter, Gia always wanted more\u2014more stability, more affection, and more time. Unfortunately, Linter just wasn\u2019t able to give her any of this, and was hesitant to put labels on their relationship. Slowly but surely, Gia\u2019s constant need for attention doused any hope of a long-term commitment.\n\nWithout Linter and with the constant pressures of the modelling industry, Gia sought out other\u2014more dangerous\u2014coping mechanisms.\n\n15. She Was A Casual User\n\nPartygoers of the decadent disco era were nose candy enthusiasts, and the powder was ubiquitous in the night club culture that Gia adored. The hotspot club Studio 54 was a notorious place for using substances, and bumping lines off the closest mirror was commonplace with the party people crowd Gia ran with. This was a slippery slope, and Gia dove down it\u2014head first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n16. She Was Oblivious\n\nOf course, this underworld had sinister consequences. It was almost too easy for an unsuspecting user to snort a different substance by mistake\u2026like say, if the substance was a white powder. Gia, like many others at the time, was sorely misinformed about it and believed that you couldn\u2019t get addicted unless under certain circumstances. As she soon learned, it was far more dangerous than she ever expected.\n\n14. She Hit Her Peak\n\nAmid the temptations of New York\u2019s nightlife, Gia was at the top of her game. To her delight, she participated in a rite of passage for A-list models, making a guest appearance in a music video. The band was Blondie, and as a huge fan, Gia cut across the dance floor, bobbing her head to the song \u201cAtomic.\u201d With the music video and her unparalleled success, everything was going according to plan\u2026\n\n\u2026But just as she was taking off, a tragedy struck.\n\n15. She Lost Her Mentor\n\nWhen Gia learned that her mentor Wilhelmina had been diagnosed with lung cancer, she felt her world crumbling around her. This powerful woman had acted as her center\u2014her maternal figure and guiding light. At the tragically young age of 40, Wilhelmina succumbed to her illness, leaving Gia all alone. Devastated and grieving, the young model made a terrible mistake.\n\n16. She Couldn\u2019t Keep It Together\n\nWith only two years of industry experience, Gia immediately began to falter without Wilhelmina\u2019s strong guidance and encouragement. Her depression drove her to self-medicate with the many subtances available to her and it wasn\u2019t long before she disappeared into the grip of addiction. Of course, this self-destructive behavior didn\u2019t bode well for her blossoming career.\n\n17. She Was A Diva\n\nEven before her troubles with addiction began to have an impact on her work, Gia was a total diva. Her high-maintenance behavior was part and parcel of her edgy style that made her unique. But there was only so much people were willing to tolerate. She was notoriously hard to work with. And as her use only escalated, so did her difficult antics\u2026\n\n18. She Lost Control\n\nBefore substances, it wasn\u2019t uncommon for Gia to wander off and ghost a set, or cancel work over a bad haircut, but under the influence, it only got worse. While on set, she started pulling vicious temper tantrums, and sometimes, she\u2019d even abandon a job just to seek out a score.At an extremely low point, her overwhelming exhaustion had her falling asleep in front of the cameras. But that wasn\u2019t all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n19. She Became An Addict\n\nGia\u2019s addiction became so bad that in one of her datebooks she made it a top priority, scrawling the words, \u201cGet heroine.\u201d Ugh! The grim misspelling is so multilayered. Gia, instead of continuing to be the hero of her own story became hopelessly enthralled by the narcotic that would doom her. As her addiction spiralled out of control, her peers and few friends began to see that Gia was on a crash course for disaster.\n\n20. She Didn\u2019t Have A Lot Of Friends\n\nDuring this time, one of the few friends Gia had left was her ex-girlfriend Sandy Linter. Linter herself was no stranger to using in nightclubs, and at the time, had no idea how destructive it could be. But witnessing Gia\u2019s descent into addiction changed all that. She was shocked to discover that, at the vibrant age of 20, Gia had so little energy she could barely dress herself.\n\nBut the side effects of addiction didn\u2019t end there\u2026\n\n21. She Had Surgery\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that a model\u2019s face and body is their brand and their product, and Gia certainly wasn\u2019t careful with the merchandise. As she constantly shot up in the same spot, her habit caused an abscess and infection that damaged a vein and required her to undergo surgery. Still, the surgery didn\u2019t fix the problem, and soon, the constant injections became an even bigger issue.\n\n22. She Had One Supporter\n\nTo her dismay, Gia\u2019s track marks soon became too noticeable to ignore. The scars and bruises marred her photos, and soon barely anybody wanted to work with her. Only one fashion photographer kept coming back to Gia. Francesco Scavullo, who had met Gia when she was just a teenager, stood by her. He had seen her potential from the get-go and supported her every step of the way.\n\nBut during a photoshoot in the Caribbean, even Scavullo couldn\u2019t deny that Gia needed some serious help.\n\n23. She Needed Help\n\nWhile shooting with Scavullo on location, Gia had a total breakdown. She couldn\u2019t find any scores, and became tearful and unstable. Luckily, Scavullo stepped in like a guardian angel and calmed her down, forcing her to go to bed for some much-needed rest. Gia was circling the drain\u2014rock bottom was just around the corner.\n\n24. She Became A Terrible Client\n\nDuring one of her last shoots for American Vogue, Gia\u2019s track marks were highly noticeable. So visible, in fact, that they can be seen in the final pictures. No amount of airbrushing could conceal the unsightly scars and bruises. This damage coupled with her lax professionalism endangered her career, and Gia was steps away from being blacklisted.\n\n25. She Jumped Ship\n\nWilhelmina as a company meant nothing to Gia without Cooper at the helm, and she left the agency to sign with competitor Ford Models. But her plan went horribly wrong. Ford Models dropped her almost immediately, and from there, Gia\u2019s career quickly went downhill. But the fashion companies weren\u2019t the only ones to steer clear of Gia, and soon she found herself more alone than ever.\n\n26. She Had Nobody\n\nAs her work dried up, her fashion industry \u201cfriends\u201d scattered like rats from a sinking ship, and even by some accounts her old bestie Sandy Linter wouldn\u2019t talk to her anymore. She became so toxic that no one wanted her rep to rub off on them by association. Jobless, friendless, and completely consumed by her addiction\u2014Gia knew it was time for a change.\n\n27. She Upped And Left\n\nGia desperately needed a break to find some clarity and came up with a strategy to get her life back on track. She made a drastic decision and abandoned the temptations of New York, returning home to Philadelphia to stay with her mother and stepfather. More than anything, she wanted to get clean, and decided to try a 21-day detox program. Perhaps this was the answer to all her problems\u2026\n\n28. She Tried To Get Clean\n\nAfter the detox program, Gia\u2019s sobriety seemed hopeful. But to everyone\u2019s dismay, the detox program didn\u2019t yield any long-lasting results. Not long after finishing the program, she relapsed\u2026and relapsed hard. In fact, she landed in some serious trouble. On one memorable occasion she incited a car chase with the authorities where she sped recklessly through the suburbs.\n\n29. She Crashed And Burned\n\nJust like her attempt at rehabilitation, her car chase antics ended in disappointment. She crashed into a fence and was taken into custody. There, they determined that she was indeed, extremely intoxicated and high as a kite. Resigned to her own dependencies, Gia tried to look for more work. But more than anything, she just wanted her old life back.\n\n30. She Put On A Brave Face\n\nIn 1981, Gia had her first and only television appearance. Her 20/20 interview on ABC highlighted the darker side of the modelling world, but also gave Gia the chance to set the record straight. She hoped to show the world that she\u2019d overcome her many demons, and was ready for a comeback. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\n31. She Lied On Television\n\nThroughout the interview, Gia claimed that her life of using was over, and that she was completely clean. But her glazed look throughout the segment only proved that she was still using. Her empty claims had her lying through her teeth\u2014so desperate was she for the industry to give her another chance. Then, later that year, something promising happened.\n\n32. She Attempted A Comeback\n\nIn late 1981, Elite Model Management decided to give Gia the benefit of the doubt and signed her. But even then, finding work was a struggle. Because of her tarnished reputation, many companies refused to even consider working with her. No matter how hard she tried to leverage her past status, her comeback soon proved futile.\n\nTo add insult to injury, her very last photoshoot sadly mirrored the success of her first one\u2014they were both infamous\u2013but for very different reasons\u2026\n\n33. Her Photoshoot Was A Disaster\n\nGia\u2019s last magazine cover shoot was for Cosmopolitan in 1982. Behind the camera was none other than her tried and true friend\u2014Francesco Scavullo. But not even his comforting presence could make this last project a success. One of Scavullo\u2019s assistants later reflected on Gia\u2019s dwindling health: \u201cI could see the change in her beauty. There was an emptiness in her eyes.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the photoshoot was a disaster.\n\n34. She Hid Her Scars\n\nThe Cosmopolitan cover featured Gia with both her arms hidden by the full skirt of her dress. The awkward pose was the only solution to cover up how disfigured Gia\u2019s arms had become from her continued use of needles. After this disastrous shoot, Gia had no choice but to resort to modelling for department stores and catalogs. But even then, fate offered her another shot at redemption\u2026\n\n35. She Had One Last Chance\n\nDespite her notoriously bad behavior, Gia was given one last miraculous chance. While doing mostly catalog work, she landed a gig with famed fashion photographer, Richard Avedon. But this wasn\u2019t just any gig\u2014it was a campaign for the fashion house of Versace. For once in her life, this was one gig Gia couldn\u2019t afford to mess up.\n\n36. She Played Hooky\n\nAfter a hard night of partying, Sandy Linter remembers Gia in the morning light, sitting in the kitchen with the phone pressed to her ear. When Gia asked her whether she should go into work or not, Linter immediately responded with \u201cNot if you feel the way I do!\u201d In retrospect this was a huge mistake. When she found out what it cost Gia to skip out on work, she wished she could take it all back.\n\n37. She Missed Out\n\nAs a supermodel, missing one day of work means sacrificing a lot. When Gia took Lister\u2019s advice and played hooky, she missed out on a $5000 payoff and so much more. When she didn\u2019t show, the model Rosie Vela took her coveted position. She had effectively blown her very last chance in the modelling industry\u2014and it was a very high price to pay.\n\n38. She Hit Rock Bottom\n\nAfter this debacle, Gia was effectively blacklisted: She was no longer able to book work with any major agency, and went at whiplash speed from a hot commodity to a pariah. Her job prospects dwindled down to nothing, and it was about to get very, very desperate. In her darkest hour, she had no choice but to scrape the very bottom of the barrel.\n\n39. She Couldn\u2019t Keep A Job\n\nGia began her illustrious career posing for ads in her hometown paper, and things came full circle when she found herself doing catalog work for an obscure German mail-order company. But even that job was too much for her to manage. Gia used on set and, unwilling to tolerate this behavior, the company fired Gia and sent her home. But while this seemed like the end, the nightmare was only just beginning.\n\n40. She Was Destitute\n\nGia\u2019s glamorous life in New York had come to an end, and having spent all her money, she was essentially homeless. She began dividing her time between her hometown of Philadelphia and Atlantic City, New Jersey while couch surfing among a handful of lovers, friends, and family members. After one last stab at rehab, she swallowed her pride and tried to find employment.\n\n41. She Took A Job In The Real World\n\nGia tried her hand at a number of jobs. First she tried retail, and when that didn\u2019t work, she became a checkout clerk. She even tried working at a nursing home cafeteria. But none of these occupations ever stuck. By 1985, Gia started using again, but this time she had no safety net\u2014no second chances. With nowhere to go, her life took a dark and dangerous turn.\n\n42. She Became A Night Worker\n\nIn lieu of unemployment, Gia resorted to selling more than just her image, but also her body. Compounded with her spiralling addiction, this was a recipe for disaster. In December 1985, she was admitted to a hospital in Pennsylvania. She was extremely ill and doctors diagnosed her with bilateral pneumonia. But little did Gia know, she wasn\u2019t out of the woods yet.\n\n43. She Had A Devastating Diagnosis\n\nA few days later, doctors revealed another, more terrifying diagnosis: Gia had AIDS-related complex. Gia was diagnosed with AIDS at a time when doctors knew very little about the disease, and there was precious little that could be done to save her. In the fall of the next year, Gia was in hospital once again\u2014and this time, she was in much worse condition.\n\n44. She Was One Of The First\n\nIn 1986, Gia faced a horrific ordeal\u2014she was beaten and raped and left out on the street. On October 18, her health took a severe nosedive, and she found herself hospitalized for the final time. With so little known about her disease, doctors treated her as though she was highly infectious. They rigorously wiped down every surface she touched, and anyone attending her wore full protective gear.\n\n45. She Had Regrets\n\nAlthough the end was near, Gia didn\u2019t find much solace in her brief life or career path. Shortly before her passing, Gia had a casual conversation with one of her nurses. Oblivious to Gia\u2019s past, the nurse told her about a photographer who wanted to take pictures of her daughter. Gia\u2019s response was absolutely tragic: \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Even if she wants it, don\u2019t let her do it. I used to be a model. You don\u2019t want your kid to be a model.\u201d\n\n46. She Had A Tragic End\n\nOn November 18, 1986, Gia Carangi passed away from AIDS-related complications. She was only 26 years old. In fact, she was one of the first famous women to ever succumb to the disease. Her family held a small service in her hometown of Philadelphia. Having been such an icon in the modelling world, one might expect Gia\u2019s funeral to be attended by a great number of old coworkers and friends\u2026But this just wasn\u2019t the case\u2026\n\n47. They Forgot Her\n\nWhen her long-time supporter and collaborator, Francesco Scavullo, heard the tragic news, he sent his sympathies and a Catholic Prayer card to her family. However, not one single person or any of her so-called friends from the fashion world attended the service. The world had already moved on from Gia Carangi, and her replacement was rearing to go.\n\n48. They Replaced Her\n\nAfter Gia stepped onto the modelling scene, her signature tomboy look became highly sought after. After she disappeared from the scene, agents worked quickly to find a new model to carry the torch and fill the void left in Gia\u2019s wake. Fashion experts soon shopped around a new young model and even dubbed her \u201cBaby Gia.\u201d Who was this young model? None other than Cindy Crawford.\n\n49. She Has A Biopic\n\nIn 1998, Angelina Jolie starred in the HBO made-for-TV biopic, Gia. Jolie had really interesting, albeit bizarre things to say about portraying Gia. Among the least weird was, \u201cI\u2019d like to date Gia. I\u2019d want to be her lover.\u201d Which is one thing, until you remember Jolie was playing her. But no matter her comments, it\u2019s safe to say that this film keeps people coming back to Gia\u2019s story time and time again.\n\n50. She Lives On\n\nOne fitting and sombre tribute to Gia is her square on the AIDS Memorial quilt. The NAMES Project created the folk-art quilt that weighs over 50 tons, and in 1989 they were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Gia\u2019s square reads, \u201cYou know what I think? I think there\u2019s a reason for everything. God has a big plan for me. Just not in this life.\u201d\n\nSources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,"}, {"url": "https://vintagenewsdaily.com/the-worlds-first-supermodel-50-stunning-photos-of-gia-carangi-in-the-1970s-and-1980s/", "page_content": "2 SHARES Share Tweet\n\nBefore Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista, there was Gia.\n\nBorn 1960, Gia Marie Carangi was an American fashion model during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Carangi is considered by some to be the first supermodel, although that title has been applied to others, including Janice Dickinson, Dorian Leigh, and Jean Shrimpton. Model Cindy Crawford was later referred to as \"Baby Gia\" due to her resemblance to Carangi.\n\nCarangi was featured on the cover of fashion magazines, including the April 1979 edition of British Vogue, the April 1979 and August 1980 editions of Vogue Paris, the August 1980 edition of American Vogue, the January 1981 edition of Vogue Italia, and several issues of Cosmopolitan between 1979 and 1982.\n\nAfter she became addicted to heroin, Carangi's modeling career rapidly declined. She later contracted HIV, which suddenly claimed her life at the age of 26. Her death was not widely publicized and few people in the fashion industry knew of it. Carangi is thought to be one of the first famous women to die of AIDS. Gia, a biographical film starring Angelina Jolie, debuted on HBO in 1998.\n\nEarly life\n\nCarangi was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the third and youngest child of Joseph, a restaurant owner, and Kathleen (n\u00e9e Adams) Carangi, a homemaker. She had two older brothers. Her father is Italian, and her mother is of Irish and Welsh ancestry. Joseph and Kathleen had an unstable, violent marriage leading Kathleen to ultimately abandoning the family when Carangi was eleven years old. Those who knew her blamed her \"fractured childhood\" for the instability and drug-dependence that plagued her adult life. She was described as \"needy and manipulative\" by relatives who recalled her as spoiled and shy as a child and a \"mommy\u2019s girl\" who did not receive the motherly attention that she desired.\n\nIn her adolescent years, Carangi found the attention she sought from other teenage girls, befriending them by sending flowers. While attending Abraham Lincoln High School, Carangi bonded with \"the Bowie kids\", a group of obsessive David Bowie fans who emulated Bowie's \"defiantly weird, high-glam\" style. Carangi was drawn to Bowie for his fashion preferences and his ambiguous gender play and outspoken bisexuality. A friend of Carangi described her \"tomboy persona,\" describing her relaxed openness about her sexuality as reminiscent of the character Cay in the 1985 film Desert Hearts. Carangi and her \"bi-try Bowie-mad\" friends hung out in Philadelphia\u2019s gay clubs and bars. Though she associated with the lesbian community, she did not want to take up \"the accepted lesbian style\".\n\nCareer\n\nSuccess\n\nCarangi was most known in modeling circles by only her first name. After being featured in Philadelphia newspaper ads, Carangi moved to New York City at the age of 17, where she quickly rose to prominence. She was a favorite model of various fashion photographers, including Francesco Scavullo, Arthur Elgort, Joseph Petrellis, Richard Avedon, Denis Piel, Marco Glaviano, and Chris von Wangenheim.\n\nWell-integrated within the fashion world, Carangi had the selection of several photographers, most notably Scavullo. By the end of 1978, Carangi was already a well-established model. In a 20/20 interview, she said her rise was \"very fast\" and \"I started working with well-known people in the industry, very quickly. I didn't build into a model. I just sort of became one.\"\n\nCarangi was a regular at Studio 54 and the Mudd Club. She usually used cocaine in clubs, but later developed a heroin addiction.\n\nIn October 1978, Carangi did her first major shoot with top fashion photographer Chris von Wangenheim. Wangenheim had her pose nude behind a chain-link fence with makeup assistant Sandy Linter. Carangi immediately became infatuated with Linter and started to pursue her, though the relationship never became stable.\n\nDrug abuse and career decline\n\nOn March 1, 1980, Carangi's agent and mentor, Wilhelmina Cooper, died of lung cancer. Devastated, Carangi started abusing drugs. Scavullo recalled a fashion shoot in the Caribbean when \"She was crying, she couldn't find her drugs. I literally had to lay her down on her bed until she fell asleep.\" Her addiction soon began to affect her work. Carangi began having violent temper tantrums, walking out of photo shoots to buy drugs, and began falling asleep in front of the camera. During one of her final location shoots for Vogue, Carangi had visible red bumps in the crooks of her elbows where she had injected heroin. The photos were airbrushed and eventually ran in the November 1980 issue of Vogue, but some photos reportedly still showed visible needle marks.\n\nBy November 1980, Carangi's career was in a steep decline. Modeling offers soon ceased and her fashion industry friends, including Sandy Linter, refused to speak to her fearing their association with her would harm their careers. She briefly signed with Ford Models \"for a couple of weeks\", but was soon dropped. In an attempt to quit drugs, she moved back to Philadelphia with her mother and step-father in February 1981.\n\nRetirement and attempted comeback\n\nAfter moving to Philadelphia, Carnagi went through a 21-day detox program. Her sobriety however was short-lived and she was arrested in March 1981 after she drove into a fence in a suburban neighborhood and took off. After a chase with police, she was taken into custody where it was later determined she was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. After her release, Carangi briefly signed with a new agency, Legends. She worked sporadically, mainly in Europe.\n\nIn fall 1981, Carangi was in the throes of drug abuse. Despite this, she was still determined to make a comeback in the fashion industry and signed with Elite Model Management. While some clients were refused to work with her, other clients were willing to take a chance because of her past status as a top model. One of her first jobs was for Francesco Scavullo who photographed her for Cosmopolitan. Scavullo convinced the magazine's editors to use the shot for its April 1982 cover. Sean Byrnes, Scavullo's long-time assistant later said, \"What she was doing to herself finally became apparent in her pictures. [...] I could see the change in her beauty. There was an emptiness in her eyes.\" The Cosmo cover would be her last.\n\nDuring this time, Carangi mainly worked with photographer Albert Watson and got jobs modeling for department stores and catalogs. In April 1982, Richard Avedon hired her for the 1982 Versace campaign which lead to her being hired for the Spring 1983 campaign. She then modeled for German mail-order clothing company Otto Versand. Around this time, Carangi enrolled in an outpatient methadone program but soon began using heroin again. During a photo shoot for the Spring 1983 Versace campaign shot in the fall of 1982, Carangi became uncomfortable and left the shoot before any usable shots of her were taken. By the end of 1982, she had only a few clients that were willing to hire her. Carangi's final photo shoot was for Otto Versand in Tunisia. She was sent home during the shoot for using heroin. She left New York for the final time in Spring 1983.\n\nLater years\n\nCarangi spent her remaining years living with various lovers, friends and family members in Philadelphia and Atlantic City. She was admitted to an intense drug treatment program at Eageville Hospital in December 1984. After treatment, she got a job in a clothing store which she eventually quit. She later got a job as a checkout clerk and then worked in the cafeteria of a nursing home. By the winter of 1985, Carangi began using drugs again. In June 1986, she was admitted to Warminster General Hospital in Warminster, Pennsylvania with bilateral pneumonia. A few days later, she was diagnosed with AIDS-related complex.\n\nDeath\n\nOn October 18, 1986, Carangi was admitted to Hahnemann University Hospital. She died of AIDS-related complications on November 18, 1986. Her funeral was held on November 23 at a small funeral home in Philadelphia. No one from the fashion world attended, mainly because no one knew about her death until months after she had died. However, weeks later, Francesco Scavullo, Carangi's friend and confidant, sent a Mass card when he heard the news.\n\nLegacy\n\nA biography of Carangi by Stephen Fried called Thing of Beauty (the title of John Keats' famous poem) was published in 1993. A biographical film, Gia, debuted on HBO in 1998. Angelina Jolie starred in the title role, garnering a Golden Globe award for the role.\n\nIn 1996, actress-screenwriter Zo\u00eb Tamerlis, herself a heroin addict who died of drug-related causes in 1999, was commissioned to write a screenplay based upon Carangi's life. This version of Gia was not produced, but after Tamerlis' death, footage of Carangi, Tamerlis, photographers, Carangi's family, and Sandy Linter discussing her life was incorporated into a 2003 documentary entitled The Self-Destruction of Gia.\n\nCarangi's sexual orientation has been disputed after her death; LGBT outlets label her lesbian, and other times as bisexual due to her sexual relationships with men. In the film Gia, Jolie also portrayed her as being sexually intimate with men and women. Since Carangi's death, she has been considered a lesbian supermodel and icon.\n\nDesigners and cosmetic firms represented"}], "Gia Marie Carangi appeared in advertising campaigns for Armani, Christian Dior, Versace, and Yves Saint Laurent.": [{"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gia_Carangi", "page_content": "Gia Carangi (January 29, 1960 \u2013 November 18, 1986) was an American fashion model during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

In the late 70s and 80s, Carangi owned the spotlight and had droves of adoring fans.\n\nIt\u2019s said that she added the \u201csuper\u201d in supermodel to describe how exponentially successful she had been in her career. Known for an edgy personality and a smoldering stare, the world was Carangi\u2019s catwalk.\n\nBut the very attitude and wild side of America\u2019s first supermodel which made Gia Carangi so desirable also made her a great danger to herself. This would be her undoing.\n\nGia Carangi\u2019s Early Life\n\nGia Marie Carangi was born on January 29, 1960, in Philadelphia to an Italian-American father, Joseph, who owned a tiny restaurant called Hoagie City. Her mother, Kathleen Carangi, was a homemaker.\n\nCarangi\u2019s parents separated in 1971. Those close to Carangi, including herself, have admitted that this divorce had a lasting impact on her attitude.\n\nHer two brothers, both older than her, moved out and lived with their mom while Carangi stayed with her father. She spent her summers behind his counter, attending concerts like your run-of-the-mill high schooler.\n\nIt was in the summer of 1978 that a local photographer and hairdresser, Maurice Tannenbaum, asked the dark-haired beauty to pose on the dance floor after spotting her at a local nightclub. Carangi\u2019s dark, tomboyish looks, 34-24-35 measurements, and perfect face were an ideal match for the fashion world which at the time was overrun with willowy blondes.\n\nTannenbaum passed on Carangi\u2019s photos to legendary New York department store Bloomingdale\u2019s photographer, Arthur Elgort. Before Carangi knew it, she was the talk of New York.\n\n\u201cI started working with very good people,\u201d Gia Carangi confided in a 1983 interview. \u201cI mean all the time, very fast. I didn\u2019t build into a model. I just sort of became one.\u201d\n\nA Meteoric Rise To Fame\n\nGia Carangi\u2019s first photoshoot at the Philadelphia nightclub, back when she was just 16, was the beginning of her meteoric rise to stardom, and life only moved faster once she moved to New York.\n\nCarangi signed with Wilhelmina Cooper, a legendary fashion agent and owner of her own modeling agency. Wilhelmina became a kind of mother figure to Carangi.\n\nFrancesco Scavullo, a leading fashion photographer of the day and who would become a personal friend of Carangi\u2019s, gushed of her:\n\n\u201cThere was something she had\u2026 no other girl has got it. I\u2019ve never met a girl who had it. She had the perfect body for modeling: perfect eyes, mouth, hair. And, to me, the perfect attitude: \u2018I don\u2019t give a damn.'\u201d\n\nThat attitude proved to be both what was so enticing and dangerous about Carangi.\n\nHer androgynous look was in part due to her sexuality. Described in some instances as aggressive and others as vulnerable, Carangi seemed to have a need to be loved \u2014 and mostly by women.\n\nThose who had worked with her said it wasn\u2019t uncommon for her to fall in love with the models she shot with. On a shoot for photographer Chris von Wangenheim, which would become wildly popular, Carangi posed nude up against a fence with makeup artist and model Sandy Linter.\n\nThe two would embark on a passionate though unrequited love affair.\n\nIndeed, Gia Carangi appeared insatiable both in her love life and in her recreational drug use. As a teen, she was already hooked on marijuana, cocaine, and quaaludes.\n\nCarangi went on to model for Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani, Versace, Diane Von Furstenberg, Cutex, Lancetti, Levi\u2019s, Maybelline, Vidal-Sassoon, and Yves Saint Laurent \u2014 to name a few. At the age of 18, Carangi was making $100,000 a year. It was more than any other model at the time, leading many fashion historians to dub her the world\u2019s first supermodel.\n\nShe then landed on the covers of Vogue and Cosmo starting in 1979.\n\n\u201cA model has to create moods,\u201d Carangi said of her talent, \u201cYou have to be careful not to get stuck in a mood \u2013 emotions have trends just like fashion \u2026 I become what ever your eye wants to see. It\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\nBut Gia Carangi remained hard to control. Though it was her edgy attitude that drew people to her, Carangi was also tough to work with. A diva by age 18, she would walk off shoots if she wasn\u2019t feeling it, or would cancel weeks of work if she didn\u2019t like her haircut.\n\nCarangi would chow down on barbecue chicken while wearing a dress worth thousands of dollars. She was also transparent about her drug use, discussing it openly in interviews and partying often with other stars and socialites at Studio 54.\n\nBut there was also a deep loneliness in her, returning to her apartment alone after work, and constantly searching for love. \u201cI am finally really starting to dig being different. Maybe I am discovering who I am. Or maybe I\u2019m just stoned again,\u201d she admitted.\n\nGia Carangi Backslides Into Drugs\n\nThe supermodel would go from a $10,000 photo shoot to a \u201cshooting gallery\u201d, or seedy locale where one can shoot up heroin, on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side.\n\nIn 1980, Wilhelmina died and sent Carangi into a spiral. Already using heroin, the supermodel delved deeper into her habit. During a shoot that year for Vogue with famed portrait photographer Richard Avedon, Carangi escaped through a window. Though incensed, the magazine gave her a second chance at the shoot, but when the pictures came back they revealed track marks and red bumps all over the model\u2019s arms.\n\nIn 1981, she was arrested for driving under the influence of a narcotic.\n\nIn May of that same year, 21-year-old Carangi needed to get hand surgery because \u201cshe had injected herself in the same place so many times that there was an open infected tunnel leading into her vein,\u201d her biographer Stephen Fried documented.\n\nFor her final Cosmo cover photo in early 1982, fashion photographer Scavullo covered up the track marks on her arms by having her put her hands behind her back. The dress she wore was poofy enough to cover up the scars of her habit. The model also angled her face to cover up the bloating.\n\nHer brother, Michael, recalled his little sister\u2019s behavior and laments: \u201cThe biggest mistake we made was that nobody went up there with her. She could\u2019ve used a friend.\u201d\n\nGia Carangi left her modeling agency, tried to stay afloat at another, but wound up returning home to Philadelphia to live with her mother at a final grasp at finding sobriety.\n\nAn Untimely Demise\n\nGia Carangi was blackballed from New York\u2019s agencies and although magazines gave her several last chances, the model could not pull herself together. One of her final shoots appeared in Vogue in 1982 and was photographed by Andrea Blanch.\n\nBy the end of that year, Carangi had become so volatile that she couldn\u2019t get booked for jobs. No one wanted to work with the wild child any longer.\n\nShe had a successful go at rehab for about a year following in Philadelphia. By this time she was broke and receiving rehabilitation from welfare.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9npRKUAeQZI\n\nMeanwhile, model Cindy Crawford came on the scene as a newer, more put together version of Gia. Crawford admitted to Playboy that many of her jobs came from those who loved Carangi and were hoping to replace her.\n\nIn the fall of 1986, Carangi was hospitalized. It became apparent that she had been sleeping outside in the rain and had been badly beaten up and raped. Blood tests showed she was suffering from AIDS-related complications.\n\nOn November 26, 1986, America\u2019s first supermodel died of those complications, though her mother was by her side.\n\nCarangi\u2019s meteoric and tumultuous career were immortalized in the HBO movie Gia that starred Angelina Jolie nearly a decade later in 1998. Jolie said of the model herself after portraying her, \u201cYou think, \u2018God, she didn\u2019t need drugs \u2014 she was a drug.'\u201d\n\nCarangi seemed to be somewhat cognizant of her brilliant, though short, career. She said forebodingly in an interview before her demise: \u201cModeling is a short gig.\u201d\n\nAfter this look at Gia Carangi, read about who some believe was America\u2019s first \u201cit\u201d girl, Audrey Munson.
