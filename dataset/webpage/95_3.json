He often needs a little encouragement to even talk about the past.\n\nAnd when he does, he nearly always has a knack of finding a way to bring the conversation back around to the future.\n\nGiven that he is still only 42 \u2014 young for a football manager \u2014 it is hard to conceive the thought that a key step on his journey to becoming Nottingham Forest manager began more than 13 years ago, when he was appointed as an academy coach at Premier League Liverpool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHanded the role of coaching the under-12 side in 2008, within three years he was head coach of the academy. Some might have seen his rise coming on the horizon given that at the age of 27 \u2014 while coaching in the academy at Wrexham \u2014 he had become one of the youngest people to complete a UEFA Pro Licence.\n\nCooper\u2019s journey into management in Championship football, with Swansea, saw him climb the ladder steadily, with his appointment in 2019 following positive spells coaching the England Under-16 and Under-17 sides, winning the World Cup with the older age group.\n\nBut it was during those five years at Liverpool that Cooper\u2019s reputation really blossomed as he played a part in the development of players like Raheem Sterling, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ben Woodburn.\n\nThis weekend, Cooper\u2019s Forest will face his former club in a FA Cup quarter-final at the City Ground that feels decidedly like a blast from the past, largely because of the shared history of the two clubs.\n\nAnd Cooper acknowledges the role his time on Merseyside played in his personal development as he looks to further enhance his reputation by attempting to mastermind a win that would propel Forest into their first FA Cup semi-final since 1991 \u2014 in the year they lost in the final to Tottenham, when he was just 11.\n\n\u201cI think all of your experiences shape you, whether they are good, bad or indifferent. I had a long time at Wrexham and they were important days,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThen Liverpool, the FA, Swansea\u2026 you take something out of everything in life. Life is all about experiences and learning from them.\n\n\u201cI had the best part of five years at Liverpool and, when I look back on that now, for me personally it was a really important time. You always do your best for the organisation you work for. It is about the job you do, rather than what you get out of it as an individual. But I was definitely a better coach when I stepped away from there than I was when I first went in there.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is what I try to achieve in every job I go into \u2014 I try to come out of it as a better coach. It is what I am trying to do here as well, at Nottingham Forest. Every step for me so far has been a beneficial one. I am still a relatively young coach, if I am allowed to say that. I am looking to always improve.\u201d\n\nDuring his five years at Liverpool, Cooper went from being an under-12 coach, to being the senior coach at the academy.\n\n\u201cAcademies are all about the players. That is all that matters. You work long hours, you run long sessions, you work with a lot of players and a lot of different teams,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cThe challenge is to help as many players as you can, as much as you can. That applies wherever you are and regardless of who you are working for and whether it is a young nine or 10 year-old or a player in the latter part of his development.\n\n\u201cI managed to work with a lot of very talented young players. Academies are all about the players; it is only ever about their development.\u201d\n\nCooper\u2019s enthusiasm for reflecting on the past is revived noticeably when the subject of who his biggest influences were at Liverpool arises.\n\n\u201cI met a really important person there, a guy called Pep Segura. He had a massive influence on me. He influenced me when it came to game understanding and the methodology of things,\u201d says Cooper.\n\nCooper with Segura (Photo: Joe Giddens \u2013 PA Images via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI was lucky enough as well that Sir Kenny (Dalglish) was still working there before he went back to being with the first team. It was brilliant to spend some time around such an iconic guy like him. They were important times for me, in terms of learning and developing as a coach.\u201d\n\nIt was Segura, who had previously managed Olympiakos and Barcelona B \u2014 where he helped develop talents such as Andres Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas \u2014 that Cooper quickly formed a close relationship with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPep was and is a major influence because I still speak to him now. He helped me understand how the game can be played and what it takes to play that way. Not so much just playing \u2014 it was about how you train as well; how you prepare players to do things in the way that you want. He taught me about the methodology behind things as well as how to do things.\n\n\u201cThe biggest message that Pep gave me was that you\u2019ve got to know what you want your team to look like. That\u2019s what I pride myself on now \u2014 having a clear view of when the team is getting it right and where I want them to go, but also how to get there. Pep put me on a different track, really.\n\n\u201cWhat is important in coaching is that you find your own way. You find what you really believe in as a coach. Because, in the end, you want your team to be a reflection of what you believe in. Pep was important to me. What I have learnt, most of all, is that what you think yourself is most important of all. I am still on that journey.\u201d\n\nCooper will not come up against Alexander-Arnold, who has developed into an integral figure at Liverpool and, arguably, one of the best right-backs in the world. The defender will be missing at the City Ground through injury. But Cooper plays down the thought of missing out on a reunion with his former player \u2014 and on any notion of him deserving any credit for the progress of players like him.\n\n\u201cCoaches don\u2019t produce players \u2014 players produce themselves. That is always something I have thought. I never think about any coach being part of a player\u2019s evolution. We are there, along the way,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cPlayers are the ones who deserve the credit for what they achieve. If they do well, they are the ones who deserve the praise for it, because it is their hard work that has got them there.\n\n\u201cWhether they turn into footballers or just good young men, that is what development is all about. It is the same here now. We have a host of young players who are working to get established. It is an ongoing daily journey.\n\n\u201cBut with Trent, I don\u2019t see it as missing out on a reunion, exactly. There are not many games where we do not come up against somebody I have worked with. Chris Willock and Andre Dozzell played with QPR. Before that, against Reading, they had Tom Dele-Bashiru in their squad. There are always players you come up against who you have a past relationship with.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nForest have already beaten Arsenal and Leicester on their way to the quarter-final. It feels like their biggest test yet against Jurgen Klopp\u2019s side.\n\nIf they are to pull off another upset, much will depend on the talented younger players within Forest\u2019s own squad. Brennan Johnson and Djed Spence have formed a dangerous partnership down the right flank, James Garner and Ryan Yates have a dynamic midfield partnership and Keinan Davis has been almost unstoppable up front in recent weeks.\n\nSpence celebrates his goal against QPR this week with Johnson (left) and Worrall (right) (Photo: Jon Hobley/MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt that young players need these experiences. Players are shaped by all experiences, be they good, bad or indifferent. But it is often the latter two that are the most important,\u201d says Cooper, who will also hope to guide Forest into the play-offs in the remaining 10 games of the Championship season. \u201cThat is where you learn the most from. It is about the difficult situations and how you respond to them. That is what defines you. It is how you respond to setbacks that shapes you.\n\n\u201cI am a big believer in self-worth in people; a big believer in positivity and what you can do. We definitely like to have positivity around our daily routines, in the terminology we use and the intent of our days. We always try to focus on ourselves, on our environment and trying to achieve \u2014 to be successful. We attack challenges, we attack big games and embrace them rather than fear them. That is our mentality and if that is building belief and building confidence, then great.\n\n\u201cEvery day I ask the players to be the best version of themselves, to be winners and to give their best; to train and play in a way that we want to do things \u2014 to behave the way we want to behave. But we have not turned things around here. Not yet. We have made some good steps. We have work still to do.\u201d\n\nPaul Taylor\n\n\u201cCoops is destined to manage in the Premier League, I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d Morecambe\u2019s Northern Irish full-back Ryan McLaughlin tells The Athletic.\n\n\u201cEven all those years ago at Liverpool it was clear that he had everything you need to make the leap from youth coaching to a senior environment. I don\u2019t think any of us have been surprised by how well he has done.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcLaughlin played for Liverpool Under-18s under Cooper a decade ago. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup where they were beaten 4-1 on aggregate by a Chelsea side including Nathan Ake and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n\nCooper during the FA Youth Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea at Anfield on April 12, 2013 (Photo: Paul Thomas \u2013 The FA/The FA via Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt was Coops\u2019 attention to detail that really stood out for me. He was very good at seeing things in your game that needed to be worked on. Then he would be relentless in terms of pummelling that into you every day on the training field,\u201d he recalls.\n\n\u201cBefore we played Chelsea he talked to me about what I\u2019d be up against in their winger Jeremie Boga. He knew him inside out. He got the balance spot on between giving you good info about what to expect but not freaking you out. He sold it to you as a brilliant challenge. He never over-complicated things. He was a really good communicator. I remember how enjoyable it was playing for him.\u201d\n\nCooper initially joined Liverpool from Wrexham in 2008. In the summer of 2011 he was promoted to academy manager by Dalglish to work closely with academy director Frank McParland, who also had a spell working at Forest during Mark Warburton\u2019s tenure.\n\nThe previous season Cooper had enhanced his reputation after stepping up to assist the academy\u2019s technical director Segura with the reserves following the departure of coach John McMahon.\n\n\u201cCoops and Pep had a great relationship,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cI know Coops took a lot from working with Pep. The Barcelona way is Coops\u2019 way. He always wanted to be expansive with the full-backs high and wide. He always wanted us to be brave in possession.\u201d\n\nThe appointment of Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool manager in 2012 sparked another reshuffle at Kirkby. With under-18s coach Mike Marsh added to Rodgers\u2019 senior staff at Melwood, Cooper took charge of the under-18s for the 2012-13 season. His squad included the likes of Jordan Rossiter, Jon Flanagan, Ryan Kent, Jerome Sinclair, Sheyi Ojo, Harry Wilson, Jordon Ibe, Tom Brewitt, Cameron Brannagan and Jordan Williams.\n\nMcLaughlin was coached by Cooper at Liverpool (Photo: Sebastian Frej/MB Media/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams, who currently plays for Bolton Wanderers in League One, was one of Cooper\u2019s youngsters who broke into Rodgers\u2019 first-team set-up, making his senior debut in a League Cup tie against Middlesbrough at Anfield in 2014.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Coops since I was nine years old and he was coaching at Wrexham. I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with him and we\u2019re still in contact a few times a month with messages going back and forth,\u201d Williams tells The Athletic. \u201cHe moved on to Liverpool when I was in the under-13s at Wrexham and then when I made the same move he was my under-16s coach at Kirkby. We had a great team. I think we only lost two games under him all season.\n\n\u201cCoops could be quite hard on us but not in a bad way. He set standards every day and he didn\u2019t like anyone falling below them. He knew what each player needed to get them going and would personalise it.\n\n\u201cI always remember striker Jerome Sinclair (who later signed for Watford) had his best season under Coops. He used to work so hard with Jerome on the training pitch. He knew he needed an arm around the shoulder, while he knew that I needed more of a kick up the ass. You can tell if someone is more suited to being a coach than a manager. Coops always had both sides. His training sessions were good and he knew how to set a team up tactically. But he also knew how to handle egos off the pitch, which is important.\u201d\n\nCentre-back Brewitt had only just turned 16 when Cooper gave him his FA Youth Cup debut in a fifth round victory over Leeds United.\n\n\u201cCoops was great for me,\u201d says Brewitt, who currently plays for Connecticut-based Hartford Athletic in the USL Championship.\n\n\u201cI was one of the youngest in the squad but he always knew how to fill me with confidence while also ensuring I was on edge to get the best out of me. He had a way of taking you out of your comfort zone. Not to a point where you couldn\u2019t perform, but to help you grow as a player.\n\n\u201cShortly before I made my FA Youth Cup debut he told me \u2018You\u2019re not in the team because of the injuries, you\u2019re in it because I picked you and I believe in you\u2019. We won 3-1 and I cleared one off the line. I felt like I had his trust and I was desperate to impress him.\n\n\u201cThere was always a feeling between us as players that Coops would go on to manage in first-team football. It was the way he went about things. He was less of a pure talent developer and more of a manager in terms of his tactics and getting the best out of players.\n\n\u201cThere was definitely an edge to him. He wasn\u2019t shy in terms of giving out a bollocking. But any criticism was always constructive. He made players better from working with them but he also made it clear that we were there to win and we needed to win in a certain way.\u201d\n\nRodgers rejigged the academy structure when at Liverpool (Photo: Clint Hughes/Getty Images)\n\nWilliams was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the 2012-13 season when Cooper was in charge of the under-18s.\n\n\u201cSometimes when you\u2019re injured managers forget all about you, but Coops cared and always went out of his way to help during a tough period,\u201d he recalls. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the nicest people I\u2019ve ever met off the pitch. He cares about what\u2019s going on in your life away from football.\n\n\u201cWhen I got promoted with Bolton, he was in touch with me straight away. When my dad passed away, Coops was the first person to come around the house. That says a lot about him.\u201d\n\nWhen Cooper left Liverpool in the summer of 2013, it was a shock for his players. His contract wasn\u2019t renewed as Rodgers\u2019 overhaul of the academy gathered pace.\n\nIt was a period of significant change at Kirkby as Rodgers sought to exert his authority. Segura had stepped down in 2012 citing a desire to return home to Spain. However, his decision was also influenced by the fact he missed out on a more senior role after the owners ditched plans to appoint a technical director and a sporting director to work with Rodgers, who had demanded sole control.\n\nAlex Inglethorpe, the current academy director, was brought in from Tottenham initially as under-21s coach and Michael Beale, currently No 2 to Steven Gerrard at Aston Villa, was recruited from Chelsea. Cooper\u2019s exit was swiftly followed by the sackings of academy head coach Rodolfo Borrell, now Pep Guardiola\u2019s assistant at Manchester City, and academy director McParland. Neil Critchley, now manager of Blackpool, had arrived from Crewe to take over from Cooper after being headhunted by Rodgers.\n\n\u201cIt was a big surprise when Coops left and I\u2019m not sure what went on,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cWe were never told the finer details, but obviously Brendan had come in as manager and was putting his own stamp on things.\n\n\u201cCoops was similar to Michael Beale and Alex Inglethorpe in terms of his approach to the game \u2014 young and very driven. Whenever I went back home to Northern Ireland people would ask me what the coaches were like at Liverpool and I\u2019d always say how lucky I was. As well as Coops, I worked with Mick Beale, Mike Marsh, Rodolfo Borrell and Alex Inglethorpe. They have all done well for themselves.\n\n\u201cThe great thing about the academy at Liverpool is that they develop coaches as well as players. Just look at the job Mick is doing at Villa and Critch at Blackpool. I enjoyed working with Coops, but I think it\u2019s only now that I fully appreciate what a brilliant coach he was.\u201d\n\nWilliams adds: \u201cWe were gutted about Coops going because we all loved playing for him. We just turned up one day and he had been replaced.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it has ever affected what Coops thinks about Liverpool. He still speaks highly of the club. He became a fan. He moved on and put everything into his new challenges.\u201d\n\nCooper twice led Swansea into the play-offs before being recruited by Forest, following the departure of Chris Hughton.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a smart move by Forest,\u201d says McLaughlin. \u201cThe impact he\u2019s had has been amazing. They\u2019re great to watch and they\u2019re winning. He has turned them into promotion contenders. He had a great education at Liverpool and as players we all benefited from that time we spent with him.\u201d\n\nWilliams agrees, saying: \u201cEverywhere Coops has been he has improved the teams he\u2019s had.\n\n\u201cI know Yan Dhanda and he really enjoyed playing for him at Swansea. Now he\u2019s got Forest flying. I\u2019m made up for him. Great coach, great person.\u201d\n\nJames Pearce\n\n(Photos: Getty Images; graphic: Tom Slator)"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/18/steve-cooper-swansea-manager-football-philosophy", "page_content": "Steve Cooper has been coaching for a couple of decades, held the pro licence since the age of 26, worked at Liverpool as their academy manager and won the World Cup with England Under-17s, yet the Welshman knew there was something missing from his CV when he applied for the Swansea job and met Trevor Birch, the chairman. For all his achievements Cooper has next to no experience of working with senior players.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the obvious question to ask about me and I wanted to make sure that, when I had my meetings with Trevor, it wasn\u2019t the elephant in the room. It could be, easily,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cWhenever a manager or head coach is appointed there are always questions and the obvious one with me is that it\u2019s my first senior job. But I wouldn\u2019t put myself in this position if I wasn\u2019t ready. The first person I asked if I was ready to work at senior level was myself.\n\n\u201cThe experiences I\u2019ve had up to now have all been ones with managerial responsibilities. At the World Cup in India I had 25 members of staff reporting to me. If you don\u2019t get that right or show good leadership or self-worth, then it can quickly fail. I\u2019ve been working towards that for a long time. Twelve months or so ago I was about 96% there. Now I\u2019m 100% ready. Yes, I\u2019ve still got to go and do it but I\u2019m fully equipped to do so.\u201d\n\nAged 39, Cooper is a bold appointment on Swansea\u2019s part and it will be fascinating to see how their decision to steer clear of the usual names on the circuit \u2013 something the Welsh club have also done in the past \u2013 works out. There is already talk outside Swansea that success or failure for Cooper may determine how easily doors open for other youth coaches. \u201cI\u2019m aware that it could be beneficial to future appointments but, if I think about that too much, then I\u2019m not thinking about today and the job in hand,\u201d Cooper said.\n\nSteve Cooper shakes hands after his first press conference as Swansea City manager. Photograph: Athena Pictures/Getty Images\n\nCooper\u2019s playing philosophy, which is heavily influenced by the time he spent working at Liverpool under Pep Segura, who is now back at Barcelona as the club\u2019s general manager, was a key factor in Swansea\u2019s decision. Over the course of three interviews Cooper convinced Birch, Leon Britton, who is the football adviser to Swansea\u2019s board of directors, and Alan Curtis, the club president, that his playing principles were totally aligned to those of the club.\n\n\u201cFootball people like myself, and fans, have admired the recent history, the journey to the Premier League, the players that have been in the teams \u2013 everyone has looked with admiration,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cSo I know what that identity stands for, and that\u2019s what I believe in too, so it\u2019s a good match, a perfect fit. I\u2019ve watched every game since Christmas and lots before it. The team is in a really good place, willing to run and be brave on the ball. I\u2019m a football coach, I want to grow the players and the identity.\u201d\n\nQuick Guide Follow Guardian sport on social media Show Twitter: follow us at @guardian_sport Facebook: like our football and sport pages Instagram: our favourite photos, films and stories YouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channels Photograph: Chesnot/Getty Images Europe Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nAlthough Cooper\u2019s long-term goal is to try to get Swansea back in the Premier League by the end of his three-year contract, his immediate focus is on continuing the rebuilding job that Graham Potter started before departing for Brighton last month. It is a task that he is relishing but one made all the more difficult by the fact that Swansea have five senior players \u2013 Jordan Ayew, Andr\u00e9 Ayew, Borja Bast\u00f3n, Tom Carroll and Jefferson Montero \u2013 whom they are desperate to offload to reduce the wage bill and fill a \u00a315m financial hole.\n\nWith that in mind, it was not surprising to hear Cooper talking about the need to be \u201ccreative\u201d when it comes to deals this summer and how he also hopes to utilise the loan market to strengthen a squad that is light after four experienced players were released at the end of last season and Daniel James was sold to Manchester United for \u00a315m.\n\nThe reputation that Cooper built as coach during his time working for the Football Association, and the contacts that he made with leading Premier League clubs, could prove to be invaluable in that respect. \u201cIt\u2019s already started,\u201d said Cooper, when asked about trying to bring players in. \u201cAnd that process has been both ways, which has been quite rewarding really. Obviously I\u2019ll be approaching certain clubs about certain players but there\u2019s already been some mentions of players who would like to work together again.\u201d\n\nWhile Cooper went on to say that he had spoken to Gareth Southgate before accepting the Swansea job, and that he was grateful for the England manager\u2019s \u201ckind words and good advice\u201d, it was tempting to wonder what the conversation was like when he called his father to tell him the news. Keith, who had a distinguished career as a top-flight referee, is a Cardiff City supporter. \u201cHe\u2019s banned,\u201d said Cooper, laughing, before adding: \u201cThe family are very proud and I\u2019m doing it for them as much as everybody else. There\u2019s only one team they\u2019ll be wanting to win.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.planetsport.com/soccer/england/steve-cooper", "page_content": "Steve Cooper Profile\n\nName Steve Cooper Born Dec 10, 1979 Age 42 years Birthplace Pontypridd Height 5ft 11ins\n\nSteve Cooper is a Welsh football manager and former player. He is the current head coach of Nottingham Forest having previously managed Swansea City and the England under-16 and under-17 set-ups.\n\nWith a relatively unimpressive playing career, highlighted by a two-year stint at Bangor City, Cooper's prowess comes via his coaching skills which have made him a highly sought after manager.\n\nHis notable work with the England youth teams included leading the under-17s to the final of the European Championship and victory in the World Cup. This success encouraged Swansea City to offer Cooper his first managerial role at club level in 2019.\n\nIn Cooper's two seasons at the South Wales outfit, he twice took the Swans to the play-offs. In his first season they lost out in the semi-finals to Brentford, who would again beat Cooper's side the next year, this time in the final. He left Swansea by mutual consent in the summer of 2021.\n\nIn September 2021 he was appointed head coach of Nottingham Forest, taking the club from the relegation zone to the play-offs, where they beat Huddersfield at Wembley. Forest had spent 20 seasons in the second tier prior to his arrival.\n\nSteve Cooper's early coaching career\n\nWhile still playing for Wrexham, Cooper trained to earn his UEFA pro license which he attained at 27, making him one of the youngest ever coaches to do so.\n\nHe went on to take up a position at Wrexham's academy as head of youth development and later moved to Liverpool in 2008 to work as a coach.\n\nAfter three years, Cooper was promoted to academy manager. He left in 2014 when the opportunity to manage England's under-17s arose.\n\nIn 2017, he coached his under-17s to the final of the UEFA European U17 Championship, losing out to Spain on penalties. Redemption came at the U17 World Cup, where again his team reached the final, this time hammering Spain 5-2.\n\nSteve Cooper's club career\n\nAfter five years managing the England youth set-up, Cooper was enticed by a job at Championship side Swansea City at the end of the 2018/19 season.\n\nIn his two seasons at the club, his knowledge of England's talented youth set-up allowed him to sign players such as Conor Gallagher and Marc Guehi, both of whom have gone on to represent the England first team.\n\nIn a dramatic end to his first season at the club, Swansea reached the play-offs on the final matchday of the season. A 91st-minute goal from Wayne Routledge secured a 4-1 victory over Reading but more crucially gave his side a superior goal difference to Nottingham Forest to pip the East Midlands club to sixth place.\n\nHowever despite a 1-0 win over Brentford in the first leg of the semi-finals, the Swans were defeated 3-1 at Griffin Park and missed out on the final.\n\nWell done Steve Cooper and all the players of @SwansOfficial getting to the play off final in Wembley\n\n\n\nCracking goal @Matt_Grimes8 pic.twitter.com/8t7zH7MSGv \u2014 \u00f0\u0178\u00b4\u00f3 \u00a7\u00f3 \u00a2\u00f3 \u00b7\u00f3 \u00ac\u00f3 \u00b3\u00f3 \u00bf \u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00a2N D L \u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00a2\u00f0\u0178\u00b4\u00f3 \u00a7\u00f3 \u00a2\u00f3 \u00b7\u00f3 \u00ac\u00f3 \u00b3\u00f3 \u00bf (@NDLane1) May 22, 2021\n\nIn his second season, Cooper again guided his team into the play-offs with a much more comfortable fourth-placed finish.\n\nA 2-1 aggregate win over |Barnsley saw them into the final.

They did not enjoy the style of football Cooper was deploying as he placed results over the notion of playing \"the Swansea way\".\n\nAfter a 2-0 play-off final defeat to Brentford, there seemed little desire from coach or club for the relationship to continue.\n\n\"I think he did a fantastic job, Swansea probably missed a bit of a trick there,\" former Wales striker Nathan Blake said.\n\n\"I think after reaching the play-offs twice, promotion in the third season seemed a natural progression. If I was a Swansea board member or fan, I'd be kicking myself.\n\n\"It's difficult to know why he's not more loved by Swansea fans. With the budget he had and the players he had, he was a master at being able to get results.\n\n\"Will Swansea fans be happier next season if they finish outside the top 10 and Forest are in the Premier League?\"\n\nCooper left by mutual consent in July, but from the heights of the play-off final he was soon signing up for a relegation battle... or so it seemed.\n\nHighlights: Ruthless Forest knock holders Leicester out of FA Cup\n\nA relegation battle becomes a promotion push\n\nDespite punching well above his weight with Swansea, Cooper's next job was at the City Ground, where Forest were rock bottom of the Championship, a club on its knees.\n\nThe side he inherited from Chris Hughton had lost six of their first seven games in making their worst start since 1913, with Cooper becoming the 14th manager they had appointed in a decade since Billy Davies' departure in 2011.\n\nNot only has Cooper transformed Forest's fortunes, taking more points than any other side since his appointment in September, but he did so in style. He turned a relegation battle into an incredible campaign where automatic promotion was possible until the final week of the season.\n\n\"No-one would have given Forest a chance of being where they are after they were bottom after seven games of the season, and the players were looking a sad group,\" former Forest midfielder Steve Hodge told BBC Radio Nottingham.\n\n\"The whole season looked to be a write-off before he took over.\"\n\nWith an emphasis on attacking football, Forest powered up the table, while some of Cooper's critics at Swansea might also have been answered with emphatic 4-1 and 5-1 wins over his former side.\n\nIt was on the coaching field that the best work was done. Cooper turned water into wine. Or rather, Djed Spence from a Middlesbrough reserve to a player now eyed by several Premier League clubs, with others such as 19-goal Wales forward Brennan Johnson also given the opportunity to shine.\n\nAn eye-catching FA Cup run also boosted Cooper's profile, with Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp singling Cooper out for praise in his speech at the League Managers' Association awards after his side edged past Forest 1-0 in the quarter-final.\n\n\"The evidence of what a good motivator and coach Steve is has been there for all to see with what he's achieved this season,\" Grainger added.\n\n\"His CV is definitely looking good at the moment.\"\n\nNottingham Forest have appointed 19 different managers since Ron Atkinson left the club following their relegation from the Premier League in 1999\n\nThe final hurdle\n\nThe next step for a coach who has now been to the Championship play-offs in three successive seasons is clear - to manage in the Premier League, with Forest now as close as they have been to a Premier League return.\n\nBeaten at Wembley last season - in a match where Swansea were clearly second best - Cooper now has a chance to complete Forest's incredible revival on Sunday against Huddersfield, having survived a scare to see off Sheffield United in a tense semi-final.\n\n\"The job Steve Cooper has done at Forest is amazing,\" Blake added. \"It is clear for everyone to see how much he's gone in and changed things.\"\n\nCan Cooper now go one better at Wembley after last season's disappointment?\n\n\"He's been to the play-offs before, he's got plenty of experience and he knows exactly how to prepare to get a result in a big, one-off game,\" Grainger said.\n\nIf Cooper can get it done, he will have capped one of the most remarkable seasons in Forest's history, taking them from a recent nadir back to the Premier League.\n\nBut whatever the result at Wembley, after years of despair, Cooper has given Forest fans hope again."}, {"url": "https://bristoljournal.co.uk/steve-coopers-wife-who-is-she-is-he-married-and-has-children/", "page_content": "Steve Cooper has been married to his wife for a few years now.
