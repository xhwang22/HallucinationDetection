Almost 300 years later, an expert botanist in Kerala undertook an equally daunting task \u2013 making the ancient text accessible to modern researchers.\n\nK.S. Manilal, a 74-year-old former professor of Calicut University, is the world\u2019s foremost authority on Hortus Malabaricus and plants of Kerala. He has spent more than 50 years deciphering the text, identifying the plants and adding to their descriptions.\n\nHortus Malabaricus, written before the international naming system for organisms was established, uses Latin transliterations of the Malayalam names of plants. This makes it nearly impossible for researchers to identify various species. With professor Manilal\u2019s English and Malayalam translations of Hortus, researchers the world over could study Hortus \u2013 one of the earliest comprehensive studies of botany.\n\nProfessor Manilal had to study Latin from scratch before he could understand the volumes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anyone to translate the text for me. So I had no option but to learn Latin,\u201d he says. With help from others, he published the English translation of Hortus Malabaricus in 2003 and the Malayalam translation in 2008.\n\n\u201cBut translation is only a minor part of Professor Manilal\u2019s work,\u201d says Joseph Antony, whose book Harithabhoopadam chronicles the professor\u2019s work. The greatest effort was in identifying all the plants mentioned in the books. \u201cAlmost 670 species of plants have been mentioned in Hortus Malabaricus and some of the names are in archaic Malayalam unknown to people today. Manilal spent 27 years visiting locations in Kochi, Alappuzha and even as far as Kollam and Kozhikode to scout for plants,\u201d says Mr. Antony. He tracked all but one of the species mentioned in Hortus. The professor\u2019s pursuit of the book and its makers took him as far as Amsterdam, where it was published. \u201cManilal rediscovered Hortus in its entirety,\u201d says Mr. Antony.\n\nProfessor Manilal\u2019s fascination with Hortus began when he was a child at Moothakunnam in Paravur, says Mr. Antony. \u201cThe professor\u2019s father used to cut out interesting news clippings and save them,\u201d he says. Among these clippings, the young Manilal chanced upon a story of how Hortus carried the first example of printed Malayalam characters. There was ignited a spark that would become his life\u2019s work.\n\nThe professor still remembers the first time he saw an original edition copy of Hortus. \u201cI was doing my M.Sc. Botany at Sagar University in Madhya Pradesh. We were on a study tour to the Forest Research Institute at Dehradun when I saw the original edition kept there,\u201d he says. He asked to be excused from the tour so he could pore over the volumes of Hortus. Over three days, he noted down the Malayalam names of plants mentioned in the book.\n\nThe three days then became a lifetime that Professor Manilal devoted to deciphering Hortus. The government of the Netherlands in 2012 conferred on him the Order of Orange-Nassau, one of the highest Dutch civilian awards, for his \u201clife-long dedication to public service through the study of Hortus Malabaricus.\u201d In his own country, however, this distinguished professor remains unrecognised."}, {"url": "https://vikalpsangam.org/article/kerala-botanist-local-knowledge/", "page_content": "K.S. Manilal first chanced upon the \u2018Hortus Malabaricus\u2019 in his father\u2019s clippings from Malayalam newspapers of the 1950s, when he was still in school.\n\nSome books just get under your skin. Like flagposts, they could draw and guide you at different points of your life. Others, especially religious works, lay the tracks on which lives run. Then there are a few that make you fall hopelessly in love with them because they approximate human infatuation, drawing you in at one moment, mystifying you at others, frustrating and delighting you. But they grow on you, so entwining themselves with your life that at some point it becomes impossible to separate the strands.\n\nFor Kattungal Subramaniam Manilal, a retired professor of botany at the University of Calicut, the love started early. It was an oddly matched couple \u2013 a tall, reserved, bespectacled man and Hortus Malabaricus, an elaborately illustrated 17th-century Latin book on the trees and plants of the Malabar region of Kerala. It defined Manilal\u2019s life and career; he would update and translate this mammoth 2,400-page, 12-volume work into English, revealing it to be one of the finest collaborations between east and west.\n\nThe task was mind-boggling. Each of the 742 plants mentioned in Hortus had to be tracked down to the areas they were originally collected from over 300 years ago, and then identified anew because modern taxonomic classification has changed significantly in this period. It showed a book that went far beyond plants, to shed light on the society, culture, science and language of its time.\n\nNow 80 and having suffered a stroke, Manilal remembers little, but signs of Hortus Malabaricus are strewn liberally over more than 50 years of his life. There are half a dozen books he wrote, many more papers and the recollections of colleagues, students and his wife, Jyotsna, who says that for a man \u201cso reticent that often she did not know what he felt\u201d, the Hortus was a \u201cpassion\u201d.\n\nManilal first chanced upon this remarkable book in his father\u2019s clippings from Malayalam newspapers of the 1950s, when he was still in school. Much later, as a postgraduate student of botany, he visited the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun, which had a complete set of the original volume of the book. He says it \u201cfired (his) imagination\u201d to find a 300-year-old Latin book of botany with names in Malayalam. He spent four days poring over the volumes and made a list of all the Malayalam names.\n\nThough he couldn\u2019t understand the Latin text, one line from the description of a plant caught his attention. \u201cThe plant\u2019s part,\u201d it read translated, \u201cif applied on the left toe improves the clarity of vision in the right eye.\u201d The medicinal properties of the plant were known but how on Earth was the connection between the left toe and the right eye established?\n\nAt that moment, Manilal knew that he had to know what the rest of the book held.\n\nThe Hortus Malabaricus was the brainchild of Hendrik Adriaan Van Rheede Tot Drakenstein (Van Rheede), an aristocrat and soldier in the Dutch East India Company who rose rapidly through the ranks to become the Dutch Governor of Cochin in 1663.\n\nFor the Dutch and the Portuguese, Malabar was a land of abundance \u2013 of wood, spices and medicinal plants. For centuries the trade in these commodities had been controlled by Arab merchants who later introduced them to the West.\n\nVan Rheede\u2019s motivations for a work cataloging the plants of the region were varied. One was economic: Arab traders sourced the ingredients for the medicines his soldiers needed from the Malabar, sold them in the West, from where the Dutch would have to import them at great expense. Procuring the medicinal plants and manufacturing medicines locally could save a lot of money.\n\nVan Rheede was also a keen naturalist, mesmerised by the luxuriance of the land he governed. He writes in the preface to the third volume of Hortus Malabaricus:\n\nAfter I had been with the Indians for a considerable number of years and on account of my office fairly often had to make journeys through very well-cultivated regions, on the way I observed large, lofty and dense forests. I saw that they were pleasing through the marvelous variety of trees, which was so great that it would be difficult to find two trees of the same kind in the same forest if one were to search for this. I rather frequently saw many ivies of various kinds climbing to one tree and moreover shooting up in the very branches of trees\u2026so that it was often very pleasant to see on one tree displayed leaves, flowers, and fruits of ten or twelve different kinds.\n\nThe last reason was political. His superior, Admiral Rijcklof Volckertsz van Goens, was keen on making Colombo the second eastern capital of the Dutch, after Jakarta. Van Rheede was staunchly opposed to this. Documenting the medicine, food and timber riches of the Malabar would \u2013 he hoped \u2013 convince authorities in The Hague to make Cochin the second capital instead.\n\nWork on the Hortus began in 1663, and continued for the next 30 years. The first volume of the book was published in Amsterdam in 1678, a few years after Van Rheede left India, and the final in 1693, two years after his death on board a ship off the coast of Bombay.\n\nMaterial for the book was first written in Portuguese in Cochin, then translated to the Dutch and finally to Latin in Amsterdam. When he first started work on the Hortus Malabaricus in 1964, almost exactly three centuries after Van Rheede had, Manilal knew that Latin would be his first hurdle.\n\nManilal enlisted the help of a local priest who, starting with the line on the connection between the left toe and the right eye, translated small segments of the work. However, to proceed further, Manilal realised he would need to learn the language. Every month he would travel to Kochi for a few days to learn the language from another priest. But even after he became somewhat familiar, he realised that the Hortus was even more difficult and technical. Each volume, Manilal says, took him three to four years. \u201cNow I look back and wonder how I did it,\u201d he was quoted as saying a few years ago. But then the language also turned out to be the easiest part.\n\nThe botanical samples documented in the Hortus Malabaricus were collected by Van Rheede on his travels in the region. Plants around Cochin were easily collected but for those found elsewhere, Van Rheede writes they often had to \u201cwait a whole year, and sometimes even longer, until we could secure one of their flowers or fruits.\u201d When travelling by water to the interiors \u201cto rebuke \u2026 some Malabar prince or other\u201d, Van Rheede would often order a party of 200 men to leave the ship and wander through the forest collecting as many different plants as they could find. They would return \u201claden with plants collected from here, there and everywhere, to (the) warships\u201d.\n\nManilal had to follow in Van Rheede\u2019s footsteps quite literally, tracking down and collecting botanical samples from the locales mentioned in the Hortus. This was because the Hortus Malabaricus was written before Carl Linnaeus\u2019s famous work Species Plantarum, in which the Swedish botanist first laid down the rules that form the basis of modern taxonomy. Botanical classification before that was whimsical and ad hoc, varying between authors. As a result plants, had multiple names, often long and convoluted.\n\nIf Hortus Malabaricus was to be relevant, all the plants it featured would have to be classified according to the modern International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Either Van Rheede\u2019s original collection, which he had shipped to Amsterdam, would have to be accessed, failing which the plants would have to be re-collected with the help of clues from the Hortus.\n\nThe original collection seemed to have vanished. Manilal made efforts to hunt it down, even going to Moscow at one point after a rumour that it might be there. He couldn\u2019t succeed.\n\nManilal decided to hunt down the plants, scouring Hortus for every possible clue to their location and appearance. It was going to be a time consuming and expensive process, so he applied for grants. The University Grants Commission (1975-1978) and the Smithsonian Institution (1984-1987) agreed to fund the project. To help with the collection Manilal roped in C.R. Suresh, a student of his who was studying plant morphology.\n\nOver the seven years covered by the grants, they travelled across the length of Kerala \u2013 \u201cfrom Kasargod\u201d at the northern tip \u201cto Trivandrum\u201d, almost 500 km to the south, says Suresh. They would travel together, but since Manilal had university work to attend to, Suresh would often be on his own. \u201cBut there were some plants Manilal sir insisted on tracking down himself,\u201d Suresh says, \u201cparticularly those specimens where he was also interested in seeing the surroundings \u2013 the geography and other plants that grew alongside.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThey managed to track down 741 plants. That was all but one of the plants mentioned in Hortus.\n\nThe first obstacle to this was pinning down the original locations. Place names had changed over the centuries. Other names were garbled in the tortuous translation from Malayalam to Portuguese, Dutch and then to Latin. In many cases, plants couldn\u2019t be found in the original locations so the team had to scout farther afield.\n\nOften they would have to venture deep into forests, where elephants and snakes were a common hazard. Suresh was also troubled by allergenic plants, of which he says there were many. \u201cThen\u201d, he laughs, \u201cthere were local problems. With our bags full of plants of all shapes and sizes, we looked like madmen and had a difficult time explaining what we were doing to the villagers.\u201d\n\nAt times the work was laborious. Getting fruits and flowers from plants would often require repeat visits at different times of the year. Suresh recounts instances on such trips when they were unable to locate the same plant, which meant they would have to start anew with another specimen.\n\nThen came the equally arduous process of identification, which involved extensive consultations with botanists around the world, and trips to labs and collections abroad. Manilal would use occasional travel to conferences abroad to sneak visits to them.\n\nBy 1988, the work was complete. In that year, Manilal, Suresh and Dan Nicolson of the Smithsonian Institution published a book entitled \u2018An Interpretation of Van Rheede\u2019s Hortus Malabaricus\u2019, listing all the plants collected by Van Rheede in modern nomenclature.\n\nFor most people, this is where it would have ended. Manilal had a full-time job at the University of Calicut with teaching responsibilities, and continued to work in other areas.\n\nAt the time of a controversy about the proposed construction of a hydro-electric project in the Silent Valley, the Kerala government commissioned Manilal to undertake a four-year study of the area\u2019s flora. His team recorded 1,000 species of flowering plants of which seven were new and others that were endangered. He also worked extensively on the orchids of Kerala, collecting over 215 species, led studies on the anatomy of cash crops like coconut palm and coffee, and researched species of marine algae that were resistant to radioactivity. But in every spare moment and interstice, he would return to his first love, because for him things were just beginning to get interesting.\n\nOther books had been written on the flora of India \u2013 but what distinguished Hortus Malabaricus was its emphasis on, and acknowledgement of, local knowledge. While Van Rheede was responsible for collecting the botanical samples, Itty Achuden, chief of the Collatt family of traditional physicians, identified them and listed their medical and agricultural uses. Achuden\u2019s role in the Hortus Malabaricus is mentioned prominently, affirmed in two certificates at the very start.\n\nInterestingly, even though he belonged to the lower Ezhava (labour) caste, Achuden had been recommended for the task by Vir Kerala Varma, the king of Cochin. Three Konkani Brahmins, whose roles have also been acknowledged in the book, worked under him. Achuden was far more knowledgeable about the local plants than the Brahmins, whose knowledge was largely restricted to providing information from their traditional text, Mahanighandu, a pharmacological glossary that lists 400 medicinal plants from different parts of India in Sanskrit. Manilal was fascinated by this deference to knowledge over caste.\n\nVan Rheede had also been similarly fascinated. \u201cI often attended a most delightful entertainment,\u201d he says, \u201cfor instance when these gentile philosophers disagreed and disputed with each other by weight of arguments. Indeed they disputed and strongly defended their own opinions, but with incredible modesty, such as you might miss in the most distinguished philosophers of the world.\u201d\n\nNone of the traditional medical texts of Achuden\u2019s family are extant. Nor, Manilal realised, was there any mention of him elsewhere. The Hortus was the only remaining repository of this knowledge. And of the plants mentioned in it, the medical uses of 139 weren\u2019t to be found in any other text. Had it not been for Achuden\u2019s contribution, the significance would have been lost to the world. For Manilal, cataloguing these medical properties and uses was imperative to protecting India\u2019s intellectual property, which, according to Jyotsna Manilal, he felt strongly about.\n\nAs Manilal delved deeper into Achuden\u2019s life, he was also drawn into an exploration of this historical interaction between caste and knowledge, which seemed to stand in sharp contrast to the modern terms of their relationship. He explored this in \u2018A Study on the Role of Itty Achuden in the Compilation of Hortus Malabaricus\u2019, a Malayalam book published in 1996.\n\nEvery aspect of the Hortus Malabaricus led the besotted Manilal down a different path. The juxtaposition of two different dialects of Malayalam in Hortus \u2013 one of which is not used today \u2013 became an opportunity to investigate the evolution of Malayalam as well. He explored the considerable impact the book had on Linnaeus; Species Plantarum has more than 250 references to it. Manilal even investigated the identify of the artist who made the frontispiece of the original volume that depicted Flora, the Roman goddess of flowers, sitting and holding a rake in front of what seems like a very ornate greenhouse. To her right, holding various plants, stand the Malabari physician and the three Konkani Brahmins who were so central to this book.\n\nIn Manilal\u2019s reimagining, the botany of Hortus Malabaricus was inextricably entwined with the eventful historical period it belonged to. He made these connections come alive. After he retired from academia in 1999, Manilal devoted himself entirely to the Hortus, the English version of which was released in 2003. He had signed off his copyright to the University of Calicut, which, in an act of cruel and petty politicking, did not invite him to the book release. But he was undeterred and continued working. According to Jyotsna, \u201cHe never really said very much about it.\u201d The Malayalam edition followed a few years later.\n\nIn 2006, Manilal suffered a stroke, leading to the loss of mobility on his right side. But he was not done yet; his work on the Hortus Malabaricus was far from complete. He taught himself to type with only his left hand to complete his last book: \u2018Hortus Malabaricus and the Socio-Cultural Heritage of India\u2019. It was published in 2012, the same year Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands conferred a state honour on him for his work on the Hortus. Sadly, there has been little recognition in India of his work \u2013 not that Manilal cares. The Hortus Malabaricus was his first love, mission and crowning glory. And love is often its own reward.\n\nFirst published by The Wire on 30 Sep. 2018\n\nLike this: Like Loading..."}, {"url": "https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/city-honours-botanist-manilal/article30966873.ece", "page_content": "March 03, 2020 12:47 am | Updated 09:31 am IST - KOZHIKODE\n\nMayor Thottathil Raveendran was all praise for K.S.
