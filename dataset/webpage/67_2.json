Why use this guide?\n\nThis guide provides advice on how to find historical records of lawyers, primarily from the 18th and 19th centuries. If you are interested in where, when and with which court a particular lawyer practiced, or you want to find some biographical background on a lawyer, the advice in this guide will point you in the right direction.\n\nThe National Archives is the best place to look for historical records relating to solicitors and attorneys but for records of barristers we hold relatively few records.\n\nTo access almost any of these records you will either need to visit us, pay for research (\u00a3) or, where you can identify a specific record reference, order a copy (\u00a3). The few records that are available online are covered in section 5 and section 6.\n\n2. Types of lawyers\n\nIn England and Wales an attorney was a lawyer who practised in the superior courts of common law. They dealt with the procedural steps of litigation but, unlike barristers, did not plead for their clients in court.\n\nSolicitors performed a similar procedural role in courts of equity. Solicitors and attorneys both represented private parties involved in litigation.\n\nIn 1873 all solicitors and attorneys became Solicitors of the Supreme Court.\n\n3. Types of records\n\nUntil 1838 solicitors and attorneys had to be admitted to each of the courts in which they wished to practise. Each court kept its own records of admissions. From 1838 attorneys were unable to practice in a court other than the one in which they were enrolled unless they first signed a roll of the court concerned.\n\nAt The National Archives we hold the records of attorneys and solicitors admitted to the Central Courts and records of some provincial attorneys who practiced at satellite courts of the Central Courts, in the Palatinates of Chester, Durham and Lancaster.\n\nThe following are the main types of records you can expect to find:\n\n3.1 Oath rolls/books of attorneys\n\nThe Attorneys and Solicitors Act of 1728 (2 Geo 2, c23) provided that attorneys and solicitors should serve five years as clerks under articles, that they should take the oath prescribed and that their names should be entered on a roll. These rolls or books of attorneys are usually arranged alphabetically and in chronological order of admission.\n\n3.2 Registers and affidavits of due execution of articles of clerkship\n\nAn article of clerkship was the agreement binding a person studying to become a lawyer to a practicing attorney or solicitor, allowing that person, after five years, to enter the profession in his own right. These student or apprentice lawyers are known as articled clerks.\n\nFrom 1749 a further Act (22 Geo 2, c46) required that an affidavit attesting due execution of articles should be filed with the court within three months of admission. The registers of these affidavits will show to whom the attorney or solicitor was articled. These registers are mostly indexed. The affidavits themselves, or the articles, if they survive will also show the name of the parent or guardian, if any, who arranged the articles.\n\n3.3 Certificate books\n\nFrom 1785 an annual certificate of admission was required before an attorney or solicitor could practise. Books of such certificates occur among court records. From 1790 the printed Law Lists were based on these certificate books.\n\n3.4 Records kept by the Law Society\n\nThe Law Society has records of the Registrar of Attorneys and Solicitors, set up in 1843. These include lists of admissions from 1845 with additional lists of admissions from about 1790 for most courts and some Registers of Articles of Clerkship from about 1860. The Law Society Library can carry out a search into the records for a fee. For a list of the records held at the library, see The Law Society website.\n\n4. How to search\n\nIt is best to start with the printed Law Lists, a directory of lawyers published annually between 1775 and 1976, bearing in mind the following caveats:\n\nlists between 1775 and 1789 are known to contain names of persons never actually admitted to a court\n\nuntil 1861 lists do not give the date of admission\n\nfor each year from 1790 lists only give the names of those attorneys and solicitors who had taken out their annual certificates to practise and omits those not practising that year\n\nLists of attorneys and solicitors admitted in 1729 and 1730 were printed for Parliament. The Law Society has a complete run of Law lists.\n\nThe next step, and for more detailed records of an attorney or solicitor, you should consult the records of the court to which the lawyer was admitted. These records are broken down, court by court, in the remaining sections of this guide.\n\nFor lawyers admitted before 1750, you should start with the admissions to the Court of Common Pleas since admissions to that court exceeded those to any other during the first half of the 18th century. After 1750, on the other hand, it is best to look first at admissions to the court of the King\u2019s Bench.\n\n5. Court of Common Pleas\n\nFor attorneys admitted to the Court of Common Pleas the following records exist:\n\n5.1 Registers of articles of clerkship and affidavits of due execution\n\nThese registers and affidavits are in record series CP 71. You can search for them online at Ancestry.co.uk (\u00a3).\n\nThe registers are arranged in chronological order of filing with the court and no complete alphabetical index exists. In addition to the names of the clerks, the masters, and the persons proving the execution of the articles there are marginal notes which indicate the courts to which admission was finally made. This information is gained from the following index volumes:\n\n5.2 Articles of clerkship\n\nSearch articles of clerkship using the name of the qualified solicitor or the person they were training. Click on CP 5 to search for records.\n\nThere is a personal name index with the printed version of the CP 5 series list, available in the reading rooms at The National Archives in Kew.\n\n5.3 Admission papers 1729-1838\n\nAdmission Papers, 1729-1838 are also in CP 5. These may include articles of clerkship, affidavits of due execution of articles, affidavits of payment of stamp duty and fiats for admission. In case of persons admitted in other courts who were seeking further admission to the Common Pleas, only affidavits of due payment of stamp duty or evidence of admissions in other courts may be found. These records contain papers of attorneys who did not complete their service under articles. Furthermore, not everyone admitted to the Common Pleas is recorded. The admission books described below are a more satisfactory record.\n\n5.4 Admission books 1724-1853\n\nThese are arranged alphabetically in two series running from 1729 to 1853. The first series contains the addresses and exact dates of admission of attorneys enrolled. The second series contains the same lists of admissions but gives only the county and year.\n\n5.5 Admission rolls 1838-1860\n\nThese include the signatures of attorneys already entered in the volumes above, arranged alphabetically. Search in CP 8.\n\n5.6 Rolls of attorneys 1730-1750\n\nThese are lists of various dates between 1730 and 1750 showing, alphabetically, the names and addresses of attorneys practising in the Common Pleas. The earlier lists in particular contain names not available elsewhere. Search for them in CP 11.\n\n5.7 Oath rolls 1779-1847\n\nThere are 31 rolls comprising a general series, 1789 to 1843; Roman Catholics, 1790 to 1836; Quakers, 1835 to 1842 and \u2018Qualifications\u2019 (subscriptions to the Test Act and the Act of Settlement in addition to the usual oaths, 1779 to 1847). The rolls record signatures, arranged by legal term and year. Search for them in CP 10.\n\n6. Court of King\u2019s Bench\n\nFor attorneys admitted to the Court of King\u2019s Bench the admission papers between 1838 and 1875 including articles of clerkship have not survived (for specimens of these records, see section 17 on other sources).\n\nThe following records do exist:\n\n6.1 Affidavits of Due Execution of Articles\n\nThese are the main source of information for attorneys admitted to the Court of King\u2019s Bench. On completion or execution of articles for the King\u2019s Bench, an affidavit was filed with the Court and given a serial number. There are eight successive series of these affidavits. The first started in 1749, a second in 1817 and a third in 1834. Further series began in 1846, 1856, 1862, 1871, 1874 and 1875. Up to about 1840 they can be obtained by reference to the appropriate Indexes and Registers. Search for them in KB 105, KB 106, and KB 107.\n\nThe Indexes are arranged alphabetically by the year of execution and give the name of the clerk, the attorney to whom he was articled and a serial number. The registers are arranged chronologically in serial number order. Next consult the series lists for KB 105, KB 106, and KB 107 as appropriate, using the serial number. The registers give sufficient details to identify the clerk.\n\nBetween 1840 and 1849 the affidavits are filed not according to the date of execution but according to the date of admission and are usually accompanied by affidavits attesting payment of stamp duty and by the judge\u2019s fiat for admission.\n\nFrom 1849 there is a further change in the method of filing. From then until 1873 affidavits are filed according to the date of execution. Affidavits of persons admitted between those dates have not survived.\n\n6.2 Indexes to registers of affidavits of due execution of articles\n\nThe references in this table are for indexes to the registers listed in section 6.3.\n\n6.3 Register of affidavits of due execution of articles\n\nFor indexes to these registers see section 6.2.\n\n6.4 Affidavits of due execution articles\n\nSeries 1 Nos 1-3000, filed 1749 to 1775 are missing. Nos 3001-20,000, filed 1775 to 1817 are in KB 105 Series 2 Nos 1-15,000, filed 1817 to 1834 see KB 106. Note that some affidavits from this series have been placed with other admission papers in KB 107 Series 3 Nos 1-7079 and subsequent series filed from 1837 up to 1875 are, in so far as they survive, in KB 107. There are indexes to KB 107 for 1835 to 1875\n\n6.5 Indexes to attorneys articles of clerkship\n\nKB 171/1 1838 Hil \u2013 1855 Mich.

The \u2018private\u2019 rolls contain the names of admitted attorneys arranged in order of date of admission under the first letter of their surnames, the addresses of the attorneys are also given and the name of the examiner. \u2018Public\u2019 and \u2018Abstract\u2019 rolls are similar to each other and do not contain the full addresses. In addition a \u2018Wales Roll\u2019 lists attorneys practising in the Court of Sessions and Great Sessions in Chester or Wales who were also enrolled at Westminster.\n\nPrivate rolls:\n\nPublic rolls:\n\nThere are also abstract rolls in KB 172/16 (1729 \u2013 1814) and Wales roll in KB 172/18 (1).\n\n7. Court of Exchequer: Exchequer of Pleas\n\nThe Exchequer of Pleas was the common law side of the Court of Exchequer. Until 1832 only the officers of the court itself were permitted to practise as its attorneys. Surviving admission records do not start until this monopoly was broken.\n\nRecords for attorneys admitted to the Exchequer of Pleas are normally in series E 4 and you should consult the series list for E 4 first of all. However they must be ordered as index volumes in the following way:\n\n7.1 Registers of affidavits of due execution of articles\n\nE 4/3 (1833-1855)\n\n7.2 Rolls of attorneys (arranged alphabetically in date of admission order)\n\n7.3 Oath rolls\n\nSearch in E 3/1 (1830-1842).\n\nFor attorneys admitted into other courts who sought to practise in the Exchequer consult the following rolls, which are in order of signing:\n\n8. Court of Exchequer: Equity\n\nThe equity side of the court exercised a jurisdiction similar to that of the Chancery Court.\n\n8.1 Entry book of annual licences\n\nThis is a book of entries of annual licences taken out by clerks of the court and solicitors practising in the Court of Exchequer as a result of the 1729 Act. It is held in E 108/1 (1785-1843).\n\n8.2 Certificates of admission\n\nCertificates of admission to the Court of Exchequer are all in E 109/3.\n\n9. Court of Chancery/Supreme Court of Judicature\n\nWith the formation of the Supreme Court of Judicature in 1875, under whose umbrella the King\u2019s Bench, Common Pleas, Exchequer of Pleas and Chancery now gathered, the Petty Bag Office series of solicitors rolls became the main admission record for solicitors (the title of attorney was abolished).\n\n9.1 Admission rolls\n\nThe table below lists references for Petty Bag Office volumes on microfilm. There are also two volumes in another series of admission registers which give only the year and not the exact date of admission: IND 1/4613 (1800-1842), and IND 1/4614 (1842-1851), both of which are alphabetical.\n\nSearch also in series C 216 for various surviving affidavits of due execution of articles of clerkship, certificates of admission and other minor admission papers.\n\n9.2 Index to Affidavits of Due Execution of Articles\n\n9.3 Index to Registers\n\nKB 170/22 (1874-1876 July)\n\n9.4 Indexes to Articles of Clerkship\n\nThe admission papers to which all the indexes above refer no longer survive.\n\n9.5 Oath Rolls of Roman Catholic Solicitors\n\n10. Court of Bankruptcy\n\n11. Records of attorneys previously admitted in other courts\n\n12. Palatinate of Lancaster\n\nIn the 14th century the Palatinate of Lancaster was granted the right to hold pleas of the Crown locally, effectively allowing a regional branch of the Court of Common Pleas. The following table lists records of the attorneys admitted to the court.\n\nFrom 1843 the Solicitors Act (6 and 7 Vic., c73 s45) allowed attorneys and solicitors working in the Courts of the Duchy or Palatinate of Lancaster to enrol at the Central Courts.\n\n13. Palatinate of Durham\n\nFrom the medieval period the Palatinate of Durham had exercised its own common-law jurisdiction, and local justices effectively represented local arms of the Court of King\u2019s Bench and Common Pleas. The following table lists records of the attorneys admitted to the court in the palatinate.\n\nFrom 1843 the Solicitors Act (6 and 7 Vic., c73 s45) allowed attorneys and solicitors working in the Courts of the Palatinate of Durham to enrol at the Central Courts.\n\n14. Palatinate of Chester\n\nThe table shows records of attorneys practicing in the courts of the Palatinate of Chester up to 1830. After 1830 attorneys practising in the Courts of Sessions and the Great Sessions in Chester and Wales were allowed to enrol in the Central Courts.\n\n15. High Court of Admiralty\n\nSearch for papers relating to the admission of proctors (attorneys/solicitors) in the High Court of Admiralty among the Admiralty Miscellanea in HCA 30.\n\nThe Admiralty Muniment Books in HCA 50 include warrants relating to the appointment of proctors.\n\n16. Prerogative Court of Canterbury\n\nSearch in the earlier volumes of the correspondence and papers of officials of the court, 1659-1857, in PROB 29, for records of the appointments of proctors (attorneys/solicitors).\n\nAt The National Archives building in Kew is a biographical index of proctors. It is located with the printed version of the catalogue, next to the PROB 39 folder.\n\n17. Other sources\n\n17.1 Solicitors Registers of Admission donated by the Law Society 1790-1884\n\nRolls of Admissions for solicitors and attorneys 1790-1884 are in RW 3. They fill in the gaps in solicitors admission rolls in other record series referred to above.\n\n17.2 Records of stamp duty 1710-1811\n\nArticles of clerkship were subject to a stamp duty. The payment of the duty is commonly recorded with the payment of the duty on indentures in the Apprenticeship Books (IR 1). The books and their indexes (on microfiche) run from 1710 to 1811 and include masters\u2019 names and addresses, clerks\u2019 names, the date of the articles and, up to 1752, the names of parents or guardians.\n\n17.3 Specimen/sample records\n\nOn the recommendation of the Report of the Committee on Modern Legal Records published in 1966 some documents were preserved as specimens only. They include:\n\n18. Records of barristers\n\nFind Barristers Rolls (1868\u20131986) in KB 4. There are earlier oath rolls in KB 24.\n\nYou might be able to find out more about a barrister by contacting the relevant Inns of Court:\n\n19.

One bad case can sink a lawyer\u2019s career, but there are many famous lawyers in history that have accomplished a great deal to make it on the most famous lawyers in history list.\n\nLawyers who go down in history often had a time in their career where they defied the odds of laws during their time and made outstanding changes. Many lawyers went on to run for office, served on the Supreme Court, or used their knowledge to become an educator, while others continued their practice in law and fought in some of the most notable court cases in history. Here is a list of 18 famous lawyers in history.\n\n1. Abraham Lincoln\n\nMore notable for being the 16th president, Abraham Lincoln was also a lawyer. Lincoln became an authorized lawyer in 1836 when he took the bar examination in Illinois. Lincoln practiced law with John T. Stuart and the two owned a law firm \u201cStuart and Lincoln\u201d. Their partnership came to an end after Stuart was elected as a U.S. Representative.\n\nLincoln continued running the law firm on his own until he partnered with Stephen Logan in 1841. Much of Lincoln\u2019s law career with Logan concentrated on bankruptcies. After Logan partnered with his son, Lincoln began a partnership with William H. Herndon in 1844 and became a prominent railroad lawyer in Illinois. Less than two decades later, Abraham Lincoln ran against John C. Breckinridge in the 1860 U.S. presidential election and won.\n\nDuring his presidency, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which freed slaves of the Confederate states. Lincoln was re-elected the following year, but was assassinated shortly after in 1865 by John Wilkes Booth while attending a show at Ford\u2019s Theatre in Washington D.C.\n\n2. Thurgood Marshall\n\nThurgood Marshall is one of the most famous lawyers in history and is known for his participation in the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court case in 1954. Marshall became interested in law at a young age after he was forced to read the U.S. Constitution for a punishment at school. His interest in law and desire to help make a change to the racial injustices that African Americans faced in the country fueled his aspirations.\n\nMarshall first attended Lincoln University and went on to study law at Howard University. Thurgood Marshall participated in a number of famous cases.\n\nMurray v. Maryland\n\nMissouri ex rel Gaines v. Canada\n\nSweatt v. Painter\n\nMcLaurin v. Oklahoma Board of Regents of Higher Education\n\nBrown v. Board of Education\n\nThe Brown v. The Board of Education case was the most significant case of Marshall\u2019s career as it deemed segregation of public schools unconstitutional. Marshall\u2019s career in law was nothing short of impressive and did not go unnoticed. President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals and President Lyndon B. Johnson later appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967. Marshall retired in 1991 and died two years later in 1993.\n\n3. Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\nCommemorated for her successful career in law, Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an acclaimed lawyer, U.S. Supreme Court justice, and professor at Rutgers University Law School and Columbia University.

Darrow is known for taking on the Leopold and Loeb trial of 1924 and the Scopes Monkey Trial in 1925. Leopold and Loeb were charged with the murder of teenage boy Bobby Franks. Darrow\u2019s argument prevented Leopold and Loeb from being sentenced to death and were sentenced to life in prison instead.\n\nDarrow defended John Scopes in the Scopes Monkey Trial for teaching evolution, which was recently made illegal in the state of Tennessee. This trial is one of the most highlighted moments in Darrow\u2019s career as a lawyer. The trial received national publicity and despite Scope being found guilty, the conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court of Tennessee over a technicality.\n\n5. Clarence B. Jones\n\nClarence B. Jones is a lawyer, legal advisor, and educator that worked closely with Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement. Jones began his studies at Columbia University, but was drafted into the army in 1953 before he could graduate.

Jones worked with other lawyers on MLK\u2019s trial for tax fraud and they won the case. MLK also wrote a letter of recommendation for Jones to take the bar exam in New York.\n\nJones continued to work alongside King and even helped him post bail when King was arrested in Alabama during an anti-segregation protest. He later helped MLK draft his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Clarence B.

He concentrated his law career on the segregation of schools and fought civil rights cases in the Supreme Court. Houston mentored Thurgood Marshall and set the stage for the major Brown v. Board of Education case that desegregated public schools. Unfortunately, Houston passed in 1950, four years before he was able witness the successful Brown v. Board ruling.\n\n9. Clara Shortridge Foltz\n\nAlthough forgotten in history by many, Clara Shortridge Foltz was an esteemed lawyer and reformist. She moved to California with her family in 1874 where she would become the first female lawyer in the state. At the time, it was very unorthodox for a woman to be working, let alone be a lawyer. In California, only white men were allowed to practice law. This changed when Foltz created the Woman Lawyer\u2019s Bill and was passed through the state Senate in 1878.\n\nThe Woman Lawyer\u2019s Bill was a huge accomplishment for women in California who could now legally practice law. Clara went on to continue her law career as the first district attorney in the state and became a leading figure in the women\u2019s suffrage movement in California and helped give women the right to vote before the 19th amendment was passed for all states.\n\n10.

He began taking on public interest cases without pay. Brandeis was nominated by Woodrow Wilson as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice in 1916. The nomination was very controversial among political parties, specifically the Republican party that supported large corporations and monopolies.\n\nBrandeis received backlash for his \u201cradical\u201d views pertaining to the U.S. economy, so much so that he had to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee to approve his nomination. Louis Brandeis participated in a number of cases revolving around freedom of speech and the right to privacy.\n\nGilbert v. Minnesota\n\nWhitney v. California\n\nOlmstead v. United States\n\nBrandeis focused much of his career on social justice and progressivism. His work led to many accomplishments and triumphs for organized labor.

Lockwood began practicing law before she was admitted to the bar until 1873, when she was admitted to the Washington D.C. bar.\n\nLockwood was previously denied entry to the U.S. Supreme Court bar as only men were permitted. She would overcome this obstacle in 1879 when she was admitted as the first woman for the Supreme Court bar. She also made a historic leap as she became the first woman to argue before the U.S. Supreme Court. Lockwood continued to work civil and criminal trials and did lecture work until she died in 1917.\n\n13. Barbara Jordan\n\nBarbara Jordan was a lawyer and politician with many accomplishments including becoming the first African American woman to be elected as a Texas state senator. She began studying law at Boston University and practiced law in Houston, Texas after admission to the Massachusetts and Texas bar examination.\n\nIn 1960, Jordan managed programs in the John F. Kennedy presidential campaign and tried to run for the House of Representatives in Texas, but did not win. Following her loss, Jordan remained determined and ran for Texas senate and won. Barbara Jordan had a very successful career as a Texas senator. She was involved in the passing of various bills related to fair labor practices including the first minimum wage law in the state.\n\nHer accomplishments did not end at senator as Jordan continued on to become the first African American chief executive in 1972. She gave an outstanding statement on the articles of impeachment for President Richard Nixon and also encouraged civil rights legislation including provisions to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nBarbara Jordan served in Congress for three terms before she retired in 1978. After her time in Congress, Jordan became a lecturer at the University of Texas. She later died from pneumonia in 1996.\n\n14. Woodrow Wilson\n\nWoodrow Wilson was a well-read lawyer who attended the University of Virginia for a short time after receiving his Bachelor\u2019s from Princeton. He was admitted to the Georgia bar and began practicing law in the state. Later, Wilson attended Johns Hopkins University and graduated with a doctorate in history and political science in 1886.\n\nWilson\u2019s law career was short lived, but his extensive schooling and studies allowed him to immerse himself into politics. Wilson became governor of New Jersey in 1910 and went on to win the 1912 presidential election against Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nDuring his presidency, Woodrow Wilson accomplished major historical milestones such as establishing the League of Nations and ratifying the 19th amendment and various labor laws. He revisited practicing law after the end of his presidency in 1921, but his practices were not as successful due to his declining health. Wilson died at the age of 67 in 1924.\n\n15. Thomas Jefferson\n\nThe famed author of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson also practiced law before becoming the third president of the United States. Jefferson attended boarding school from a young age and attended the College of William and Mary in 1760. Jefferson studied under law professor and founding father George Wythe and was admitted to the Virginia bar.\n\nIn 1776, Jefferson along with other delegates convened to write the Declaration of Independence. Within the same year, he became a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and served for three years. Jefferson was also responsible for writing the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom which supported the separation of church and state.\n\nJefferson became the Governor of Virginia, serving two terms from 1779 to 1781, during the Revolutionary War. He received major backlash after fleeing from British military troops that raided Virginia. After Jefferson fleed, he returned to his Monticello home for retirement and to take care of his wife who was ill.\n\n16. Arabella Mansfield\n\nArabella Mansfield was the first woman to become a lawyer in the United States by passing the Iowa bar examination in 1869. At the time, only men were allowed to take the bar but Mansfield scored highly and challenged the original statute in court. The statute was amended, making Iowa the first state to allow women and minorities to take the bar.\n\nMansfield had a very successful career as an educator. She lectured at Iowa Wesleyan College and DePauw University and became a dean. Mansfield studied under her brother in a law office prior to taking the bar exam, but instead of practicing law she wanted to focus her career on education and women\u2019s suffrage.\n\n17. Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nIn 1900, Franklin D. Roosevelt began his studies in law at Harvard College. After he graduated, he remained at Harvard for another year and became editor of the university\u2019s daily newspaper, the Crimson. Franklin decided to extend his study in law at Columbia University, but did not graduate. Despite not finishing his academic career at Columbia, Franklin passed the bar and worked at a law firm in New York City for a short time.\n\nFranklin was encouraged to run for office in the New York state senate in 1911 and won. He was re-elected the following year but did not finish his second term as he accepted an offer to serve as a secretarial assistant to Woodrow Wilson\u2019s secretary of Navy.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was elected president in 1932 and served for four terms. Roosevelt was thrown into the midst of the Great Depression which forced him to enforce policies and programs to provide the U.S. economy with relief and recovery. His famous inaugural speech that stated, \u201cthe only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d gave hope to many. Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s first 100 days in office proved that he was determined to turn the economy around by implementing various programs, such as:\n\nAgricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA)\n\nPublic Works Administration (PWA)\n\nCivilian Conservations Corps (CCC)\n\nTennessee Valley Authority (TVA)\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\n\nRoosevelt was also a part of the \u201cBig Three\u201d, who met in the Yalta Conference, securing Joseph Stalin\u2019s promise to join forces in the Second World War and established an organization for peace amongst nations, which became known as the United Nations. Roosevelt died from health issues in 1945 and was succeeded by President Truman.\n\n18. Myra Bradwell\n\nIn order to help her husband run his law firm, Myra Bradwell took an interest in the profession. She became more inspired while working as editor-in-chief of her Chicago Legal News weekly publication. As a working woman in the 1850\u2019s, Bradwell did not have much legal control over her business and finances as they were attached to her husband. Bradwell went to the Illinois legislature to be granted a charter so she could take on legal contracts without her husband.\n\nBradwell was the first woman in Illinois to be admitted to the bar in 1869, but could not legally practice law due to her marriage. This obstacle was brought to the Supreme Court in the Bradwell v. Illinois case in 1873. The outcome of the case did not rule in Bradwell\u2019s favor as the Supreme Court ruled that it did not violate the 14th amendment, which was used in her argument that it violated her rights and privileges.\n\nMyra Bradwell was admitted to the Illinois Supreme Court bar and the U.S. Supreme Court bar in the 1890s, despite not being able to legally practice law. Bradwell continued to oversee her newspaper and used it as an outlet for women\u2019s rights and working within the legal profession.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nMany lawyers throughout history achieved great heights and established new legislation to improve social, economic, and political issues.\n\nSome lawyers went into politics after practicing law and ran for office to make change, while others used their extensive knowledge and determination to better the laws set forth by the Constitution and help others.\n\nRelated Articles"}, {"url": "https://tarltonapps.law.utexas.edu/justices/profile/view/45", "page_content": "Associate Justice, Texas Supreme Court, 1867-1869\n\n\n\nAndrew Jackson Hamilton was born January 28, 1815 in Huntsville, Alabama. He received his education there and was admitted to the bar in 1841. In 1846 he moved to LaGrange, Texas, where he practiced law for three years. Following his appointment by Gov. Bell to the position of attorney general in 1849, he settled permanently in Austin. He represented Travis County in the Texas Legislature from 1851 to 1853, and in 1859 he was elected to the U.S. Congress.\n\nHamilton was a strong and vocal opponent of secession. In late 1861 he returned to Austin from Washington and was elected to the state senate. But Texas was now a Confederate state, and the Unionist Hamilton declined to take the oath required for office. Instead he fled to Mexico, and then went to Washington, DC, where he was appointed brigadier general for the Texas troops fighting on the Union side. He was a great orator and gave pro-Union speeches in northern cities. He spent the latter part of the war in New Orleans, which had come under Union control in 1862.\n\nIn 1865 President Johnson appointed Hamilton Provisional Governor of Texas. In 1867 Hamilton was appointed an associate justice of the Texas Supreme Court; this was the court known as the Military Court, appointed when Texas came under military command following the Civil War.\n\nHamilton participated in the Reconstruction Convention of 1868. A moderate Republican, he ran unsuccessfully for governor against the radical E. J. Davis in 1870. Following the election, Hamilton returned to private life, practicing law and working on his farm near Austin. He died of tuberculosis in Austin on April 11, 1875 at the age of sixty, and was buried in Austin's Oakwood Cemetery.\n\nNotable opinions\n\nLuter v.

We could even just find grains and dust,\" says Giorgio Gruppioni, an anthropologist who is participating in the project. \"But if the remains are well kept, they are a biological record of events in a person's life, and sometimes in their death.\" Silvano Vinceti, the leader of the group, said that he plans to press his case with the French officials in charge of the said burial site at Amboise Castle early next week.\n\nLeonardo moved to France at the invitation of King Francis I, who named him \"first painter to the king.\" He spent the last three years of his life there, and died in 1519 at age 67. The artist's original burial place, the palace church of Saint Florentine, was destroyed during the French Revolution and remains that are believed to be his were eventually reburied in the Saint-Hubert Chapel near the castle.\n\n\"The Amboise tomb is a symbolic tomb; it's a big question mark,\" said Alessandro Vezzosi, the director of a museum dedicated to Leonardo in his hometown of Vinci. Vezzosi said that investigating the tomb could help identify the artist's bones with certainty and solve other questions, such as the cause of his death. He said he asked to open the tomb in 2004 to study the remains, but the Amboise Castle turned him down.\n\nThe group of 100 experts involved in the project, called the National Committee for Historical and Artistic Heritage, was created in 2003 with the aim of \"solving the great mysteries of the past,\" said Vinceti, who has written books on art and literature.\n\nArguably the world's most famous painting, the \"Mona Lisa\" hangs in the Louvre in Paris, where it drew some 8.5 million visitors last year. Mystery has surrounded the identity of the painting's subject for centuries, with opinions ranging from the wife of a Florentine merchant to Leonardo's own mother.\n\nThat Leonardo intended the \"Mona Lisa\" as a self-portrait in disguise is a possibility that has interested and divided scholars. Theories have existed: Some think that Leonardo's taste for tricks and riddles might have led him to hide his own identity behind that puzzling smile; others have guessed that the painting hid an androgynous lover.\n\nIf granted access to the grave site, the Italian experts plan to use a tiny camera and radar to confirm the presence of bones. The scientists would then exhume (\u6316\u6398) the remains and attempt to date the bones with carbon testing.\n\nAt the heart of the proposed study is the effort to discover whether the remains are actually Leonardo's, including with DNA testing.\n\nVezzosi questions the DNA comparison, saying he is unaware of any direct descendants (\u540e\u4ee3) of Leonardo or of tombs that could be attributed with certainty to the artist's close relatives.\n\nGruppioni said that DNA from the bones could also eventually be compared to DNA found elsewhere. For example, Leonardo is thought to have rubbed colors on the canvas with his thumb, possibly using saliva (\u553e\u6db2), meaning DNA might be found on his paintings.\n\nEven in the absence of DNA testing, other tests could provide useful information, including whether the bones belonged to a man or a woman, and whether the person died young or old.\n\nEven within the committee, experts are divided over the identity of the \"Mona Lisa.\"\n\nVinceti believes that a tradition of considering the self-portrait to be not just a faithful imitation of one's features but a representation of one's spiritual identity may have resonated (\u5171\u9e23) with Leonardo.\n\nVezzosi, the museum director, dismissed as \"baseless and senseless\" the idea that the \"Mona Lisa\" could be a self-portrait of Leonardo. He said most researchers believe the woman may have been either a wife of the artist's sponsor, the Florentine nobleman Giuliano de Medici, or Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a rich silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. The traditional view is that the name \"Mona Lisa\" comes from the silk merchant's wife, as well as its Italian name: \"La Gioconda.\"\n\nWhere is this passage most probably taken from?\n\nA.

As a scholar, teacher, reformer, and dean of Harvard Law School, Pound strove to link law and society through his \"sociological jurisprudence\" and to improve the administration of the judicial system. In the early decades of the century, Pound was viewed as a radical thinker for arguing that the law is not static and must adapt to the needs of society. By the 1930s, however, he was seen as a more conservative figure, fighting the growth of federal government.\n\nPound was born on October 27, 1870, in Lincoln, Nebraska. The son of a judge, Pound attended the University of Nebraska, earning a bachelor of arts degree in botany in 1888. His father convinced him to attend Harvard Law School, but he stayed only one year. The death of his father led Pound to return to Lincoln, where he passed the Nebraska bar examination and was admitted to the bar in 1890.\n\nFrom 1890 to 1903, Pound practiced law, taught at the University of Nebraska, earned a doctorate in botany from the university, and served as the director of the state botanical survey. In addition, he helped organize the Nebraska Bar Association in 1900.\n\nA gifted scholar, Pound could have had a distinguished career in the sciences, but his appointment in 1901 as a commissioner of appeals for the Nebraska Supreme Court permanently shifted his career to the law. As a commissioner he acted as a temporary appellate judge, helping to reduce a backlog of cases. His opinions emphasized substance over procedure and reflected a concern with the practical effect of the law.\n\nIn 1903 he was appointed dean of the Nebraska College of Law. His academic interests merged with his experience as a court commissioner in 1906 when he addressed the annual convention of the AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION in St. Paul. His speech, titled \"The Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice,\" was a call to improve court administration and a preview of his theory of law, called sociological JURISPRUDENCE . The speech, which has remained a classic statement on JUDICIAL ADMINISTRATION , attracted the attention of JOHN HENRY WIGMORE , the dean of Northwestern University School of Law. He asked Pound to join his faculty in 1907. Pound's two-year association with the school was marked by his organization of the First National Conference on Criminal Law and Criminology, which gathered participants from many professions to discuss ways to reform the criminal law. The conference was one of the first of Pound's efforts to give practical application to sociological jurisprudence.\n\n\"T HE LAW MUST BE STABLE , BUT IT MUST NOT STAND STILL .\"\n\n\u2014R OSCOE P OUND\n\nIn 1910, after having spent a year at the University of Chicago, Pound joined the faculty at Harvard Law School. He was appointed dean in 1916 and served until 1936. It was during this period that Pound's views and influence were at their zenith.\n\nPound's contribution to U.S. jurisprudence was to further the work that OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES JR. had begun in debunking the legal theories that had dominated during the nineteenth century. Pound fought the notion that an unchanging and inflexible NATURAL LAW formed the basis for the COMMON LAW . He did believe that some constant principles existed in the common law, particularly ones dealing with methods, to which he gave the name \"taught legal tradition.\" Pound firmly believed that the implementation of the principles of the taught legal tradition by wise common-law judges resulted in substantive change, which reflected changes in society. As the interpreters of the common law, judges had a special duty to consider the practical effects of their decisions and to strive to ensure that judging facilitated rather than hindered societal growth.\n\nPound placed his sociological jurisprudence in opposition to what he termed \"mechanical jurisprudence,\" which he characterized as a common but odious practice whereby judges woodenly applied precedent to the facts of cases without regard to the consequences. For Pound, the logic of previous precedent alone would not solve jurisprudential problems.\n\nDespite his desire to see the law adapt to the needs of society, Pound believed that the common law should develop slowly and that it should only follow changes in society. Certainty in the law, especially in areas such as commercial and PROPERTY LAW , was often more beneficial than attempts at practical alteration. He revealed a more conservative cast of mind in his distrust of legislative statutes, arguing that the slow development of judge-made law was preferable to the radical changes often brought by legislation. His study of biology led him to believe that the law, like nature, was a seamless web and that changes in one part might produce totally unexpected and undesirable results in a distant part.\n\nPound's sociological jurisprudence fell out of favor in the 1930s, when the LEGAL REALISM movement attacked his philosophy. Though the legal realists and Pound had much in common, the realists, especially JEROME N. FRANK , differed over the nature of judicial decision making. Where Pound believed that judges, with the objective application of his principles of sociological jurisprudence, could logically produce the result in a given case, Frank, in his book Law and the Modern Mind (1933), thought otherwise. Frank maintained that not logic but the\n\nunique psychological makeup of judges was the most important factor in the resolution of a lawsuit. The realists pointed out, after analyzing many court decisions, that often a judge could support a decision for either side on a given legal issue. Therefore, they argued, judges were forced to decide cases on the basis of their subjective feelings of what was \"fair\" and then turn to the applicable part of the case law to furnish legal fig leaves to hide what they had actually done.\n\nPound reacted angrily to this analysis in a series of law review articles. He believed that the RULES OF LAW , especially rules of commercial law and property, could be determined with certainty and even attain the logical coherence of propositions of Euclid. Pound conceded that it was important to study the psychology of judging, but only to prevent the aberrations the realists claimed were common. Pound thought that the realists emphasized the oddities, and not the central factors, in their analysis of the judicial system. He disliked the realists for discounting the importance of the common law and for their willingness to advocate that the law be used to change society. For Pound, the legal system worked best when the law followed society. Any attempt to make society follow the law was futile."}]}
