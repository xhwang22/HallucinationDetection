Meer conducted fieldwork and influenced Kuper\u2019s Indian People in Natal (1960) as well as Kuper\u2019s play The Decision (1957). One of the themes in Meer\u2019s work was black and Indian women\u2019s experiences of racism and sexism and the use of suicide as a mode of resistance within apartheid South Africa (1976). This presentation explores how Kuper and Meer influenced each other\u2019s writings and anti-apartheid activism.\n\nOrganization\n\nI begin with an explanation of Hilda Kuper & Fatima Meer and then move into their collaboration, focusing on the publications they wrote together or that were thematically connected. In part 3, I detail the timeline of their relationship. In the last section, I describe Hilda\u2019s play The Decision, influenced by her research with Fatima Meer and discuss their overlapping themes such as suicide and different types of elites within the Indian community in South Africa.\n\nPart 1: Intro to Hilda Kuper & Fatima Meer\n\nHilda Kuper was born in 1911 in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa and received her anthropological training with Winifred Hoernl\u00e9 at the University of Witwatersrand and Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics. Kuper\u2019s first fieldwork involved studying the impact of liquor laws on black women in Johannesburg. Later her research sites expanded to Swaziland and Indian communities in Durban, Natal, South Africa, where she formed a life-long friendship and research partnership with sociologist, Fatima Meer, who was of South African, Indian, Muslim and Jewish descent. Their collaboration will be the focus of this presentation.\n\nHilda Kuper at her home in Los Angeles, 1974, at a party organized for her students, photograph by Dawn Chatty\n\nThrough Hilda\u2019s marriage to Leo Kuper she became involved in non-violent apartheid protests as one of the founders of the Liberal Party and was forced to leave South Africa; she eventually became a Professor of Anthropology at UCLA.\n\nHilda Kuper (center) with Leo Kuper, her husband (behind), and Max Gluckman, her old friend and anthropology colleague from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, (at the right) at Watts Towers, Los Angeles. Hilda Kuper Papers, UCLA Special Collections, Box 45, Folder 20. For more information on the connection between Max Gluckman and Hilda Kuper see Andrew Bank, p. 193, n. 17\n\nIn her theorizing about black women, Hilda took a \u201cSwazi point of view,\u201d arguing that Westernization weakened women\u2019s position. She portrayed Swazi women and Indian South African women as the victims of colonization as well as patriarchal indigenous systems.\n\nHilda\u2019s initial interests in law, acting, languages and history, morphed into her career as a legal and political anthropologist, novelist and playwright. Durkheim and French sociology were also highly influential, as both Hilda and her research collaborator, Fatima Meer, wrote about suicide and women of color in Southern Africa.\n\nHilda\u2019s graduate student at UCLA, David Kuby, said the following of her Jewish identity:\n\n\u201cJewish, British and African are quite a combination of values not easily put into one neat box and there was a comfortable, very human dimension of Hilda that was humble and nonjudgmental that made one feel very accepted in our imperfections despite Hilda\u2019s high standards for scholarship and social justice work.\u201d -David Kuby, December 29, 2016, e-mail correspondence\n\nThe information in this section comes from a brief bio I wrote of Hilda, based on my dissertation. You can find the full bio I wrote here on my academia.edu page and the excerpt from it was published at Bustle.com.\n\nFatima Meer and Nelson Mandela at her home in 1995, image by Richard Shorey\n\n\u201cMeer\u2019s Gujrati grandfather, Ismail, had arrived in South Africa as a trader from Surat on the east coast of India in the 1880s. Her father, Moosa Meer, was the editor of Indian Views, a weekly in Urdu and English. Her mother, Ameena, was a white woman [whose father was Jewish] originally called Rachel. The Meer household was a mixture of Muslim Gujarati traditions and liberal political activism; Fatima combined the two.\u201d\n\nWajid, Arjumand. 2010. \u201cFatima Meer: Academic and Activist.\u201d The Hindu, March 30, 2010.\n\n\u201cAt a time when most Indian girls were helping their mothers in the kitchen making samosas, this young woman was leading protest marches and challenging the most oppressive system in the world.\u201d Winnie Mandela\n\nFrom the Wajid obituary of Fatima Meer, March 30, 2010.\n\nAn article about Fatima\u2019s artwork that was created while she was in the Women\u2019s Gaol in Johannesburg has just come out this October in the New Yorker magazine. I visited the Gaol in March 2017, while in Johannesburg for my dissertation research. You can also learn about Fatima\u2019s art work during her imprisonment here.\n\n\u201cMorning in the Prison Yard\u201d by Fatima Meer, a photograph I took of her painting, one of many displayed on this mesh-like canvas throughout the women\u2019s gaol. Photo by Abby Gondek, March 26, 2017\n\nPhotograph of myself taking a photo of the display for the wash-house courtyard. This was one of the most traumatic areas in the prison because I learned that female prisoners had to wash all of the clothing, including the male prisoners\u2019 pants, which were oftentimes stained with blood (likely from being raped or lashed). These are images from the Women\u2019s Gaol in downtown Johannesburg, where Fatima Meer was detained (in 1976) and painted scenes from her daily life in the prison. The painting on the left contains the following explanation written by Meer: \u201cThe two prisoners in the foreground are carrying our bath water from the kitchen. The other prisoner brings our flask of boiling water. The awaiting trial prisoners line up for breakfast on the left. The \u2018convicted\u2019 line up on the right. The three prisoners facing the wall are waiting for sanitary pads. They will get three each for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026in 1976, [Fatima Meer] was held for six months, without trial, under the apartheid government\u2019s Terrorism Act. Her crime was an attempt to organize a mass rally with the activist Steve Biko, after police shot at and killed student protesters in the township of Soweto.\u201d Anakwa Dwamena, October 23, 2019, The New Yorker\n\nPart 2: Writing collaboration\n\nHilda collaborated with Fatima Meer on a project about Indian South Africans in Durban, Natal (Kuper and Meer 1956).\n\nThis network visualization developed using nodegoat, a project of Lab1100, displays the connections between the publications of Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer.\n\nThis network visualization displays the publications written by Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer. \u201cIndian Elites in Natal\u201d (1956), co-authored by Kuper and Meer, shared a thematic focus on Indian South Africans and protest with Hilda\u2019s book Indian People in Natal (1960), for which Fatima Meer acted as a research assistant. \u201cIndian Elites\u201d also shared an emphasis on Indian ethnic groups, such as Tamil and Hindustani, with Hilda\u2019s play The Decision (1957). All three of these works, contrasted the \u201cAfrican\u201d (meaning black) and Indian South African populations. Note the connection between Violaine Junod\u2019s \u201cReport on a Study of the Coloured \u2018Social Elite\u2019 in London\u201d (1952) and Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer\u2019s \u201cIndian Elites in Natal\u201d (1956). Violaine Junod was close to both Hilda Kuper and Fatima Meer (Junod n.d.). Fatima Meer described the Kupers and Violaine Junod as her \u201cmost constant friends\u201d during the Treason Trials in 1956 (Meer 2017, 169).\n\nJunod, Violaine. n.d. \u201cViolaine Junod Letters to Hilda Kuper, Correspondence from 1970s-80s.\u201d Box 52.

Cape Town: Kwela Books.\n\nPart 3: Hilda and Fatima\u2019s relationship\n\nHilda met Fatima Meer in 1952 when Hilda moved to Durban, where her husband Leo Kuper, received a Sociology chair position at the University of Natal. It was Leo, the new head of the department, who allowed Fatima to rewrite her sociology honors exam (after she had been failed by a racist Afrikaner Nationalist lecturer); she passed with \u201cflying colours\u201d (Meer 2017, 150-151).\n\nFatima was Hilda\u2019s research assistant for Kuper\u2019s book Indian People in Natal (Kuper 1960, x). The Institute of Community and Family Health in the Newlands neighborhood in Durban funded this research (Meer 2017, 155). Fatima\u2019s fieldwork notebooks in the Hilda Kuper Papers, elaborate the effect of Indian immigration to South Africa upon caste affiliation, marriage traditions, legally required medical care, and labor strikes. Meer also tracked and summarized the ship logs by sex, age, caste, religion, village, and marriage status (Kuper et al. 1953). In her autobiography, Fatima refers to \u201cfilling in dozens of these reporter\u2019s notebooks\u201d but unfortunately, she was dismissed after only a year from this position at the Institute of Community and Family Health because of her anti-apartheid activism and radicalism; Hilda and Fatima were both shocked (2017, 158). Hilda clearly used Fatima\u2019s notes in Indian People in Natal in Chapter 1 regarding migration and Chapter 2 on changes in caste affiliation post-migration.\n\nKuper, Hilda, Fatima Meer, R. Singh. 1953. \u201cHilda Kuper Papers, Box 14 (Fatima Meer and R. Singh Fieldnotes).\u201d Los Angeles: UCLA Special Collections.\n\nHilda Kuper\u2019s transnational migrations & fieldwork, a geographical visualization, developed using nodegoat, a project of Lab1100\n\nHilda conducted fieldwork in Durban in three Indian suburbs from 1953-1957 with funding from the Council for Social and Industrial Research. She worked with Indian health educators who were trained by the Institute of Community and Family Health including four women Miss N. Perumal, Mrs. Padmini Govindoo, Sally Naidoo and Violet Padayachee. In addition to Fatima Meer, Mrs. Radhi Singh assisted Hilda (Bank 2016, 218-221; Kuper 1960, x).\n\nBank, Andrew. 2016.

London, England: Cambridge University Press, International African Institute.\n\nThe Kuper home was a central site for anti-apartheid solidarity across racial lines. On November 9, 1952, Leo collaborated with the joint ANC-Indian Congress political rally at Red Square in Durban; he wrote about his experiences in Passive Resistance in South Africa (1955). Leo was arrested in 1956 with Alan Paton and four Indian Congress members for their participation in the \u201cassembly of the Native\u201d in the Gandhi Library Hall in Durban; this is where they launched a defense fund for the 156 Treason Trialists. Hilda was arrested earlier in 1956 with Fatima Meer at a women\u2019s march protesting new laws that extended the pass system to \u201cnon-European\u201d women (Bank 2016, 217\u201318). Also in 1956, the Kupers \u201csolicited a loan\u201d and \u201cstood guarantor\u201d for Fatima and her husband Ismail Meer, so that they could get the capital to build their house, since non-whites could not get loans at that time (Meer 2017, 163).\n\nHilda was \u201ccombative with non-progressive colleagues\u201d and was excluded from a departmental research trip to Swaziland, despite her expertise (Russell 1994, 146). By the late 1950s, the apartheid police increasingly harassed Leo and Hilda, spies attended their lectures, and Leo was threatened with a banning order; eventually Hilda instigated their departure from South Africa (Golomski 2011, 4; Moran 1988, 198).\n\nRussell, Margo. 1994. \u201cOBITUARY: Hilda Kuper, 1911-92.\u201d Africa 64 (1): 145\u201349.\n\nGolomski, Casey. 2011. \u201cHilda Kuper, Anthropology, History.\u201d In University of Swaziland, UNISWA, History Staff Seminar Series, 21.

Urbana: University of Illinois Press.\n\nIn 1970, Hilda wrote to Fatima from Los Angeles to express that she was \u201cso delighted\u201d with Fatima\u2019s book (Portrait of Indian South Africans, 1969) that she and Leo felt Fatima should submit it for a Ph.D.\n\n\u201cThe photographs are fascinating and the text is rich in perception.\u201d Kuper, Hilda. 1970. \u201cHilda Kuper to Fatima Meer and Ismail Meer, March 20, 1970.\u201d Los Angeles, CA: Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 41, Folder 9, UCLA Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library.\n\nIn closing, Hilda wrote, \u201cThere is so much to talk about that cannot be expressed in letters. We think of you very often and send you much, much love\u201d (Kuper 1970). In her autobiography, Fatima wrote that Hilda Kuper \u201cconsidered the manuscript so good that she canvassed the head of department to award me a doctorate for it\u201d (Meer 2017, 186).\n\nIn this letter from Hilda to Fatima, Hilda explains that she is about to visit her daughter Mary in Israel, before going to Swaziland (in 1970 Hilda became a Swazi citizen). Hilda complements Fatima on her new book and expresses how much both she and Leo think of Fatima and send much love. Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 41, Folder 9.\n\nPart 4: The Decision\n\nThe Decision (1957) is a tragic play written by Hilda Kuper in which the female lead character is punished through death, for the patriarchal and racist hierarchical structure of her society. In this play, Savitree, a girl from a high caste Hindi speaking family in Durban, in Natal province, South Africa, fell in love with a Tamil Christian boy, Siva, whose family was from Southern India.\n\nThe cover page for the program of Hilda\u2019s 1957 version of The Decision, performed in Durban by medical students at the University of Natal. Sondra Hale personal collection of Hilda Kuper\u2019s creative writing at UCLA, Anthropology Department.\n\nTheir different ethnicities and religions, as well as the fact that Siva was active in the Indian National Congress and the passive resistance movement, marked Siva as \u201cother\u201d and unmarriageable (61). One version of the story closed when Savitree set fire to herself and died because her family forbade her to be with Siva (Kuper 1993, 63).\n\nKuper, Hilda. 1993. A Witch in My Heart: Short Stories and Poems. Edited by Nancy Schmidt. Madison: African Studies Program, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. https://books.google.com/books?id=bh5aAAAAMAAJ&pgis=1.\n\nIn a different version of the play, Savitree sacrificed herself by marrying the man her family decided she should marry (Kuper 1957, 30\u201331).\n\nKuper, Hilda. 1957. \u201cThe Decision: A Contemporary South African Indian Play.\u201d Durban Medical Students Drama Group. Los Angeles, CA: Sondra Hale Personal Collection, UCLA Anthropology Department, Haines Hall 391.\n\nDirectly before Siva heard the news of Savitree\u2019s suicide (in the 1993 version) he told his activist friends that Indian South African families imprison their daughters in domestic roles, preventing their freedom. Siva\u2019s friend Rajid Naidoo argued:\n\n\u201cAfrican women are a major force in African politics, but few Indian women are active in political affairs.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1993\n\nThis implied that the problem was within Indian culture, rather than South African culture as a whole. Siva\u2019s friend Chetty remarked that the women should \u201cfree themselves\u201d rather than waiting for men to do so, upon which Siva discovered that Savitree killed herself, causing the reader to wonder if this was Savitree\u2019s way of \u201cfreeing herself\u201d (Kuper 1993, 63).\n\nIn the 1957 version of the play, Siva\u2019s words close the play:\n\n\u201call I wanted is to be myself and let others be themselves.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1957\n\nHe contended that Savitree should not have had to sacrifice herself for her family out of the \u201cstrength of her affection for others, for those who had brought her up.\u201d Siva emphasized that her loyalty should not lie with her family alone but with the \u201cfamily of the people of the world\u201d (31).\n\nPerhaps, this was Kuper\u2019s message for unity rather than separation between not only Indian South Africans, but also all South Africans.\n\nIntriguingly, Kuper revealed that she had never published the play because a few Indian couples confronted her after a performance of the play in Durban (by Indian medical students) to inform her they would sue her for writing about their families. Though she did not know these families Hilda\n\n\u201crealized that I had struck a very vulnerable center and Indians were already scapegoated for much of the antagonisms so sadly I put the manuscript aside\u201d but she was revising it for publication in the months before her death (Schmidt 1993, 1, n.5). Schmidt, Nancy J. 1993. \u201cIntroduction.\u201d In A Witch in My Heart: Short Stories and Poems, 1\u20133. Madison: African Studies Program, University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.\n\nHilda had written about a case very similar to the one she depicted in her play, in her 1960 book, Indian People in Natal (for which Fatima was a research assistant).\n\n\u201cBy no means unusual is the case of the girl from an orthodox Hindi speaking family who fell in love with a Tamil boy; on discovering this, her parents married her to a man of their own choice. From the beginning the girl was most unhappy with her in-laws, and after one of her frequent visits home she threatened to commit suicide if forced to return to them.\u201d Hilda Kuper, Indian People in Natal, 1960, p. 136\n\nThe Decision echoes some of the findings from a paper about Indian elites in Natal, co-written by Fatima Meer and Hilda Kuper (1956). They described two primary elite groups: the protest and compromise elites.\n\n\u201cThe protest elites, led mainly by intellectuals, identify with Non-Europeans and \u2018oppressed people\u2019 in general; the compromise elites operate as a defensive and exclusive minority\u201d (Kuper and Meer 1956, 145). Kuper, Hilda, and Fatima Meer. 1956. \u201cIndian Elites in Natal, South Africa.\u201d In Social Science Conference, University of Natal, Institute for Social Research, 129\u201345. Durban, Natal, South Africa: University of Natal, Institute for Social Research.\n\nSiva was part of the protest elite, while Savitree\u2019s family represented the compromise elites. Meer and Kuper found that original caste differences between Indian immigrants were fading because of the\n\n\u201cupward mobility of the ex-indentured and the downward pressure from the Europeans, and it appears that the Indian elite of the future will relate more to the Non-Europeans in general than to specific sectional groups.\u201d Kuper and Meer, 1956, p. 145\n\nInterestingly, despite caste distinctions fading, ethnic differences were not, for example between Tamil, Telegu and Hindustani, which are clearly displayed in Hilda\u2019s play since Savitree\u2019s Hindustani family disapproved of Siva because he was Tamil (Kuper 1957; Kuper and Meer 1956, 130).\n\nThis article about Indian elites echoes (thought does not cite) Violaine Junod\u2019s findings from 1952 about protest and compromise leaders among the \u201ccoloured\u201d social elite in Britain. Compromise leaders were the intermediaries between white and black groups, serving as non-political token \u201ccoloured\u201d spokespeople \u201con show\u201d in a \u201czoo situation\u201d within white organizations, which were \u201csympathetic\u201d to \u201ccolonial\u201d issues. Compromise leaders had no direct ties to either colonial nationalist governments or to policy makers and were seen as \u201cacting white\u201d (Banton 1960:151-153). In contrast, protest leaders had close links with colonial nationalist movements, denounced white racism, and held defiant attitudes toward whites supposedly \u201csympathetic\u201d to the cause. Protest leaders were esteemed by \u201ccoloured\u201d community members but disliked by whites (Banton 1960:152).\n\nBanton, Michael. 1960. White and Coloured: The Behavior of British People towards Coloured Immigrants. 2nd ed. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press.\n\nFatima and Hilda\u2019s findings related to Indians and suicide are interconnected.\n\n\u201cFrom the official figures of \u2018self inflicted deaths\u2019 published for Durban, the number of Indians who took their own lives is roughly the same as of Europeans, both being proportionately higher than the number of Africans and Coloureds; but when to these figures is added deaths in the category of \u2018accidental burning\u2019 \u2013 and burning is the traditional method of committing suicide among Hindus -the Indians outnumber all other racial groups.\u201d Hilda Kuper, 1960, p. 173\n\nThis is one of the tables from Fatima Meer\u2019s 1976 Race and Suicide in South Africa, p. 236. In the earlier period, 1940-60, Indian women had the highest mean suicide rate (16.2) among women and were only second to White males. In the later period, Indian women\u2019s suicide rate increased to 26.4 (yet all groups increased) but this rate was less than that of Coloured women, as well as four other race-gender groups.\n\n\n\nThis table (23b) from Fatima Meer\u2019s 1976 Race and Suicide, emphasizes that the huge majority of Indian women who committed suicide were housewives. This was also true of Coloured women, but the Indian women\u2019s percentage was much higher. Not pictured here is table 23a: of African women who committed suicide, 63.9% were housewives, while 53.7% of white women who committed suicide were housewives. See pages 249-250.\n\nConclusion\n\nFatima Meer and Hilda Kuper collaborated both political and theoretically, through their shared research interests. Hilda supported Fatima unconditionally (both financially and academically) while Fatima conducted foundational fieldwork which informed Hilda\u2019s writing, both academic and creative (through Hilda\u2019s play The Decision). Some of the key themes that they developed were the differences between Black women and Indian women in terms of involvement in South African politics. Fatima investigated the differences in suicide rates by race, gender, class and occupation in South Africa in the mid-20th century. Hilda explored a specific instance of suicide through her fictional play, which was based on the research she had conducted with Fatima. They also shared an interest in different types of elites, protest v. compromise elites, and they investigated how caste differences were becoming less important while ethnic differences were not, as evidenced in Hilda\u2019s play, The Decision.\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/pioneers-of-the-field/historical-ethnography-and-ethnographic-fiction-the-south-african-writings-of-hilda-beemer-kuper-19111992/02124070830870B965E44957D3645968", "page_content": "Dr Winifred Hoernl\u00e9, my first teacher in Social Anthropology, introduced me to the complexities of Indian culture in South Africa, and by her knowledge, insight, and sympathy awoke in me, as in so many of her students, both an interest in research and a respect for humanity. Hilda Kuper, \u2018Changes of Caste of the South African Indians\u2019, Race Relations Journal: Special Issue: Homage to Winifred Hoernl\u00e9, 22, 4 (1955), 18.\n\nUnlike those women anthropologists whose contributions are discussed elsewhere in this book, Hilda Beemer Kuper (1911\u20131992) had no festschrift written in her honour when she retired in 1977, after fifteen years as Professor and Chair of Social Anthropology at UCLA. This was, in large part because of the difficulty a team of prospective editors had in getting authors to reflect on her body of experimental writings, which was well ahead of its time in anticipating the \u2018literary turn\u2019 in social anthropology. While Hilda had been trained in the most rigorous of terms in this discipline, her work is notable for its diversity and creative experimentation. Her anthropological monographs (or at least sections of them) read like histories with close attention to chronology, detail and divergence, as well as their intense interest in individuals, variation and contingency rather than the general laws sought by many of her peers. Her body of ethnographic fiction is substantial and sophisticated. It includes sixteen short stories, one novel and two plays, one of which (A Witch in My Heart) she understandably regarded as her finest achievement as a writer. She was also a talented poet and passionate political essayist.\n\nThis range of creative writing is far from apparent in the standard overview of social anthropology in South Africa, where the analysis of her contribution is confined to little more than a single page, which discusses just one of her four major monographs: An African Aristocracy: Rank among the Swazi. Even this widely acknowledged classic is grossly caricatured as a static, functionalist \u2018tribal\u2019 monograph, with no proper reference made to its sequel, The Uniform of Colour: A Study of Black-White Relationships in Swaziland. She is alleged to have made \u2018no lasting contribution to anthropological theory\u2019 since \u2018Societies conceived of as wholes are not suitable subjects of study. They are idealized (almost mystical) concepts.\u2019\n\nFortunately, there have been better informed assessments of her extensive body of anthropological work in biographical dictionaries and obituary articles, although none of these exceeds a few pages in length. In fact, this chapter is the first (and long overdue) essay-length appraisal of her life and work, apart from her reminiscences presented to a seminar at UCLA in May 1981 that were taped, transcribed and published. In general, I attribute much greater significance to her four-and-a-half decades in South Africa (1917\u20131961) and to the southern African focus of all of her anthropological work than she was inclined to do after twenty years of immersion in American scholarly circles. More specifically, I accord more weight to the importance of the Jewish background which she shared with her classmates, Max Gluckman and Ellen Hellmann, than she was inclined to give in late life retrospect. In keeping with the other chapters in this collection, I highlight the importance she accorded to the influence and methods of her mentor Mrs Hoernl\u00e9. Based on a close reading of her truly voluminous published writings, I pay fuller attention to her contribution to the study of history and social change in southern Africa that can be tracked across her four major monographs: An African Aristocracy (1947), The Uniform of Colour (1947), Indian People of Natal (1960) and Sobhuza II (1978).\n\nMy central concern, however, is to highlight the significance of her body of creative writing in the genre usually described as \u2018ethnographic fiction\u2019. While her creative writing has productively been read as contributing to a rich but often disavowed subgenre within British and American anthropology, and to an emerging anti-segregationist \u2018protest literature\u2019 in South Africa, I seek to add a further layer by closely historicizing her creative writing. In particular, I explore the links between her experimental fiction and her more formal anthropological scholarship. To begin with, I locate her turn to fiction within the context of her historically sensitive anthropological method and richly descriptive ethnographic style as developed in her pioneering Swaziland ethnography of 1942, published five years later in two separate books but initially written as a 692-page doctoral thesis at London University. During what I demarcate as her first phase of creative writing, dating to the early to mid-1940s, I indicate that her work was experimental with character and plot still relatively underdeveloped, but also strongly biographical with a female researcher as the central protagonist in most of the short stories that she set in Swaziland and South Africa. During her second phase of creative writing, after she and her husband Leo had returned to South Africa in 1952 with two young daughters, she developed the theme of social change, of the confrontations between tradition and modernity, in a much more sophisticated way. I read her mature ethnographic fiction of the mid- to late 1950s, most fully articulated in her two plays, A Witch in My Heart and The Decision, and her novel, A Bite of Hunger, in the context of her more intense investigation of inner life that is the hallmark of her truly remarkable but unheralded study of the history and practices of the Hindu religious communities in Durban. As she herself so eloquently put it: \u2018The drama, the novel, the poem, and the [ethnographic] monograph complement each other, each presenting a different facet of the whirling worlds within and around the self.\u2019\n\nIn short, Hilda Kuper was a creative writer who straddled the disciplines of anthropology, history and literature, one who experimented with narrative in different ways at different stages of what was a highly productive and dynamic South African anthropological career. It is only by paying attention to the importance she accorded to experimental writing and her great talents across different forms of this art that one can develop a full appreciation of the extent of her significance as a social anthropologist in southern Africa and indeed beyond.\n\nGrowing up in a Jewish family, 1911\u20131928 Ever alert to contingency, diversity and the mark of the individual in history, Hilda began her memoir with the reflection that \u2018despite all the common experiences that we\u2019 \u2013 that is, she and her internationally famous South African peers (Meyer Fortes, Isaac Schapera, Max Gluckman, Monica Wilson, Eileen Krige, Ellen Hellmann and Jack Simons) \u2013 \u2018recall when we talk to each other, each of us came to anthropology as the result of particular personal experiences\u2019. In relation to her background, she reflected, No doubt it was partly fortuitous events over which I had no personal control: the fact that I was born in the little town of Bulawayo, in the then British colony of Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), where the white settler population held very privileged positions. My parents, however, were first generation immigrants from continental Europe \u2013 my father from Eastern Europe and my mother from Vienna \u2013 and very early in life I was made aware of certain political conflicts. Her parents were Jewish. Hilda\u2019s father, Josef Beemer, was a Lithuanian-born Jewish trader who had set up shop on the outskirts of Bulawayo around the turn of the century. Her mother, Antoinette Renner, was an attractive Jewish woman from an upper-middle-class Viennese family who had come to this remote town to attend her sister\u2019s wedding. Here she met Josef, whom she married despite her parents\u2019 disapproval. Born on 23 August 1911, Hilda was a much indulged youngest child. During the First World War her father was sent to fight in East Africa, but died of influenza in 1917. The best glimpse into her early childhood is her deeply moving short story entitled \u2018The Photograph\u2019. It tells of the pain experienced by a sensitive young girl who sees her mother being torn by conflicting allegiances: on the one hand, to a husband fighting for the British; on the other, to a beloved brother fighting for the Germans. The photograph of the title is of the Austrian brother, Uncle Franz, and the central moment in the story occurs when her mother is forced to remove the picture from their lounge wall, as it has become an image of the enemy. From this moment onwards, her mother no longer spoke to her and her siblings in German, no longer regaled them with heroic stories from her Austrian past, nor sang romantic lieder. The account ends with the young girl returning from school to find her mother bereft, a letter in her hand announcing the death of Uncle Franz not long before the signing of the Armistice. She could not bring herself to accompany her children to the railway station where the crowd was celebrating the return of the victorious British soldiers, including her own long-absent husband. Hilda also vividly remembered a visit to her aunt\u2019s farm when she witnessed her uncle beating his black farm-workers. It was her first intense experience of the brutality of whites towards Africans. After the death of her husband, Antoinette took her family to Johannesburg. They stayed with Josef\u2019s brother, Uncle Yoshie, who ran a department store. Hilda became aware of anti-Semitism for the first time and of being regarded as a \u2018stranger\u2019. The family\u2019s social network was almost exclusively Jewish, although her upbringing was not orthodox. She and her sister Ellie, to whom she was very close, were sent to boarding school at Parktown Girls. They were independent, free-spirited and attractive young girls. Hilda was apparently pursued by a string of Jewish boys, including Max Gluckman, whom she befriended at the age of fifteen and dated for a time. (Ellie would later be immortalized as \u2018The Blue Princess\u2019 of her one-time admirer Herman Charles Bosman\u2019s poems.) Hilda\u2019s teenage ambitions fluctuated between wanting to study to be an actress in England and following a career as a criminal lawyer in South Africa on account of (what she would retrospectively identify as) \u2018her increasing awareness of discrimination and the plight of innocent victims [in South Africa]: servants living in the backyard, the brutal treatment of blacks by whites, and her own Jewish heritage\u2019. In the end she chose to do a BA degree at Wits University, beginning in February 1928, at the age of sixteen.\n\nReading anthropology with Hoernl\u00e9 and Malinowski, 1929\u20131934 As is customary with South African undergraduate degrees, Hilda took a wide range of subjects. She began by intending to major in French and English literature, with history as an additional subject, but stumbled upon anthropology in her second year. \u2018I had a spare course, and while I was talking to a friend about possible subjects, she suggested an interesting course she had taken, taught by a very interesting woman.\u2019 She later took other subjects in the Bantu (African) Studies undergraduate programme, including Native Law and Administration and isiZulu. But it was anthropology for which she developed a passion, owing to the gifts of her lecturer. Hilda\u2019s unusually vivid recall of the central themes of the undergraduate lectures that she attended with Ellen and Max were cited in an earlier chapter, as well as the way in which their teacher set them to work on language texts associated with their different backgrounds or skills. Hilda was put to work on \u2018the great French school of sociology\u2019 with particular attention to the writings of Durkheim. It opened up a new world. She [Mrs Hoernl\u00e9] had insisted that anthropology was a factual discipline based on observable behaviour, and we had read such ethnographies as Boas\u2019 Eskimo, Lowie\u2019s Crow and Junod\u2019s Life of a South African Tribe. I had also read Spencer and Gillen, and when I read Durkheim\u2019s interpretation of Arunta rituals in the Elementary Forms of the Religious Life, a thousand ideas, connections, meanings and new insights flooded my mind. I had a particularly heavy dose of Durkheim because in our allotted reading, Mrs Hoernl\u00e9 gave me specific responsibility for Durkheim. She got Hilda to translate the entire text of Durkheim\u2019s The Rules of Sociological Method from French to English, which suggests an unusually advanced degree of fluency and conceptual ability for a nineteen-year-old. She remarked that this early \u2018saturation\u2019 in Durkheim \u2018made an indelible impression on me \u2026 His conceptualisation of society, social facts, equilibrium, types of solidarity dominated my thinking for many years.\u2019 The emphasis on the ritual affirmation of social cohesion in her famous first monograph was one mark of his influence. Isaac Schapera\u2019s lectures, by stark contrast, were dry and \u2018droning\u2019. \u2018Schapera was not an inspiring lecturer \u2026 [Y]ou had to tell yourself, \u201cDon\u2019t go to sleep \u2026 \u201d\u2019 Like Ellen and Max, however, she did find her first experience of fieldwork on their vacation trip to Mochudi in September of her final year instructive. She related an amusing anecdote about their shared Jewish backgrounds. Gluckman and Schapera stayed with the trader, and all the women [Ellen, Hilda and a visiting Cambridge-trained anthropologist Camilla Wedgwood] at a Dutch Reformed mission station, which created problems because the fieldwork trip coincided with the Jewish Day of Atonement. My mother did not want me to go, but the Chief Rabbi [Dr Landau] \u2013 a great friend of ours \u2013 said that it would be all right if I fasted. So I fasted while my Jewish colleagues ate; they thought it funny, but the missionary concluded that I was the only one worth \u2018saving\u2019. There was more to Mrs Hoernl\u00e9\u2019s influence than lessons about reading distant European schools of anthropology in their own languages, their own terms and with an open mind. As we have seen, she encouraged in her students a tolerant attitude towards inter-racial relations grounded in a universal moral politics which emphasized common human values and virtues, against the background of a South African political culture obsessed by racial and cultural difference. She persuaded Hilda to become actively involved in the Indian Joint Council during her Honours year in 1931. Mrs Hoernl\u00e9 was chair and Hilda served as the secretary. She organized a research project for her, funded by the South African Institute of Race Relations. Hilda was confronted, for the first time, by the dark underbelly of her society. My research involved finding out what happened to the children of [beer-brewing African] mothers rushed off to prison. There were hours spent in jail with these women, getting information so that I could go back to their homes, find out how their children were, and come back and report \u2013 partly as researcher, partly as someone who could help them. The prison was so soul-destroying and dehumanizing, but what astonished me was the courage of the women, their resilience, [and] their willingness to start brewing again as soon as they returned home. She did the research partly out of financial necessity. For the second time in her life, she and her family had lost their male patron in sudden and tragic circumstances when Uncle Yoshie fell down a lift shaft. Mrs Hoernl\u00e9 explained the implications of \u2018the catastrophe\u2019 in \u2018a card of introduction\u2019 to Malinowski, penned in September 1932, the month before she sent Hilda to further her graduate studies under the great master in London. She introduced Miss Beemer, in the first instance, as \u2018a Jewess\u2019 from a non-orthodox background. Hilda was a \u2018very bright girl\u2019 who \u2018has shown very fine grit and determination. Her father died many years ago but she had been brought up \u2026 by a bachelor uncle who suddenly died when his affairs were very involved so that she and her mother were left very badly off indeed.\u2019 Mrs Hoernl\u00e9 also noted that Hilda was already set on Swaziland as her future field-site. She intended to do a doctoral thesis on \u2018The nature and function of Magic among the Swazi\u2019. She had settled on social anthropology as her chosen career. \u2018She is young, of course, and at present thinks her whole life is to be devoted to Anthropology \u2026 \u2019 Her SAIRR research director and former lecturer in Native Law and Administration, R.D. Rheinallt-Jones, was said to have warned her that: \u2018You [will] face two disadvantages: first, that you are a woman, and second, that you are Jewish.\u2019 Neither was a deterrent in the view of Malinowski, whose London seminars were notable for the diverse origins of his students. He would write tongue-in-cheek in one of his first letters to Hilda in the field: \u2018It is with some distress that a pure Nordic like myself finds that among the best pupils I have to register one Bantu [ZK Matthews], one pure-bred West African, three Jews [Gluckman, Fortes and herself] and a half-caste Chinaman.\u2019 He was also known for his active encouragement of women scholars. Hilda\u2019s classmates included Margaret Read, Lucy Mair and Susan Fortes. They were joined in her second year by Monica Hunter, fresh from Pondoland. Where there had been four students in her class at Wits, there were now twenty-three graduates attending the weekly seminars. Their seminars were dedicated to a page-by-page proof-reading of his third and final Trobriand monograph, Coral Gardens and Their Magic (1935). It is easy to imagine that a literary-minded scholar-in-the-making like Hilda would have been profoundly influenced by this intimate exposure to Malinowski\u2019s richly descriptive narrative style. Given her long-standing interest in theatre, she greatly admired the weekly one-man performances of the self-appointed \u2018Conrad of anthropology\u2019. He taught by what he, with typical lack of modesty, liked to describe as his \u2018Socratic method\u2019. In her memoir Hilda told of the intellectual roasting to which he subjected \u2018the Mandarins\u2019, those interlopers who had come to anthropology from other disciplines (like her friend Meyer Fortes who had been trained in psychology). She would write more frankly in private to Audrey. It was excruciatingly embarrassing to watch him use his razor wit! \u2026 [H]is mind was as quick as lightning. One couldn\u2019t relax in his seminars; he himself was almost frighteningly tense and watching his audience like a lynx \u2026 He gave an impression of arrogance and sensitivity, of cruelty and kindness; he was a complex mix of snob, connoisseur and humanist. Hilda and Malinowski were well suited temperamentally. She was described at the time as \u2018rather romantic\u2019 and \u2018idealistic\u2019, characteristics that Malinowski shared. She was also not afraid to speak her mind, something that he liked in his students. The main lesson that she learnt from Malinowski was \u2018an awareness of the care and skill that were involved in doing fieldwork\u2019. He encouraged a very particular regimen of field-writing, which she would follow to the letter during her two years of doctoral field research in Swaziland. I am tempted to interpret her later experiments with genre, at least in part, as an outgrowth of her induction into diverse modes and styles of field-writing. For everyday purposes there were field-notes, recorded on site, ideally without any help from a research assistant. These should include extensive records of texts and terms in vernacular languages. In the evenings the field scientist \u2013 and all of his students emphasized Malinowski\u2019s rigorously scientific conception of their craft \u2013 could record their private feelings and thoughts in a diary. As Malinowski\u2019s own journal would so scandalously reveal, the diary could serve as a psychological release for the culturally alienated (and sexually frustrated) anthropologist. He succeeded in persuading almost all his students to keep diaries, although sadly Hilda burnt hers. Then there was the field report, an altogether more energetic endeavour. Malinowski expected his field-researchers, of whom he supervised more than a dozen in the years after 1932, to send him detailed descriptions of their progress and findings on a monthly basis. Hilda\u2019s and Godfrey Wilson\u2019s dense and extended field reports say as much about the unusually high levels of expectation of their supervisor as they do about the gifts of these two as writers and fieldworkers. In both cases he wrote to request their permission to read their reports to his seminar students. He also gave them constant advice. In Hilda\u2019s case, for example, he warned her to keep her own observations clearly distinct from those of her informants. Finally, there were the famous \u2018charts\u2019 that he expected fieldworkers to record in a separate, more visually-oriented, notebook, which would also feature village maps and genealogical diagrams. His functionalist chart was an abstract grid of information arranged by \u2018institution\u2019 (law, kinship, economics, land tenure and religion), in which specific data was plotted onto the general template in order to assist researchers in conceptualizing each aspect of culture as part of an interrelated system. Like Audrey, Hilda recalled being able to visualize Malinowski\u2019s chart before she entered her field-sites. The lessons in London went beyond the seminar and its magic circle. Hilda was psychoanalysed during her first six months. She attended lectures on psychoanalysis and Marxism. She also attended Zulu language classes and lectures on economic anthropology by Raymond Firth. Her interest in left-wing politics gave rise to concern on Malinowski\u2019s part. He sternly warned her against associating with the ideas of Harold Laski and ordered her to \u2018Keep off that Jewish nihilistic communism which is the undoing of the best minds of your race.\u2019 A lesson of a more personal kind came in the mid-year break between her two academic years in London. Hilda returned to South Africa in June 1933 and got engaged to Isaac Schapera. We know very little about their romance. The International African Institute\u2019s records reveal their concern about the impact that the proposed marriage might have on the fieldwork of a young woman scholar whom Malinowski and Firth had come to consider as \u2018among the two or three ablest students who have been studying at the LSE\u2019. Whatever the circumstances, the break-up is said to have shaken Hilda deeply and left her emotionally fragile for some time. However, soon after these events she began to date Leo Kuper, a criminal lawyer who was three years her senior and who came from an orthodox Jewish family. She had met him during her graduate years at Wits. They got engaged less than a year after she had returned to Johannesburg from London in May 1934. They would marry in January 1935 and form a deep intellectual and emotional partnership across almost six decades. The IAI \u2018had a policy that married women refund any money they had received, on the assumption that they would end their fieldwork and careers\u2019. Hilda assured them that she did not mean to shelve her career in anthropology merely on account of marriage.\n\nA historical anthropology of the conquering aristocracies of Swaziland, 1934\u20131942 In later life, Hilda reflected: \u2018To some it [fieldwork] is a confrontation and an ordeal; to others a series of encounters; and to others a transforming and humanizing experience.\u2019 Hilda\u2019s fieldwork in Swaziland clearly fell in the last category. It began on 28 July 1934, when she and Malinowski set off by bus from Johannesburg to Mbabane after her mentor\u2019s recent performance at the New Education Fellowship Conference at Wits. It was at this conference that Hilda first encountered the Swazi Paramount Chief Sobhuza II (1899\u20131981). She vividly recalled seeing him in the audience of the lecture-hall. \u2018I observed [leaning slightly forward as if to catch each word] a man in the mid-thirties, of medium weight and build, with a strong face, deep brown in complexion, a wide forehead, broad flared nose, high cheek bones, bright deep-set penetrating eyes, a short, natural untrimmed beard and smiling mouth. But it was not the build or general features that set him apart as much as a general impression of animated intensity and personal dignity.\u2019 Much has been written about the relationship between Sobhuza II and \u2018his\u2019 anthropologists. This literature does show, in a refreshing reversal of the usual charges against anthropologists as agents of colonialism, that Sobhuza II \u2018used\u2019 social anthropologists to promote his, rather than their, agendas. Hugh Macmillan has demonstrated that Hilda and Malinowski entered Swaziland at a time when the Paramount Chief was actively promoting the reinvention of Swazi tradition. This involved energetic attempts to resurrect declining traditional cultural institutions and rituals, most notably the rituals of kingship of which the annual incwala ceremony was the most important national event. In the year that she entered the field, he skilfully enlisted the support of all the most influential anthropologists of the day \u2013 Schapera, Hoernl\u00e9 and Malinowski, as well as Hilda herself \u2013 to support his plan to have the system of education of the traditional Swazi male military regiment (the libutvo system) introduced as part of the curriculum in Swazi schools. Hilda\u2019s fieldwork would simply not have been possible without Sobhuza\u2019s support, as she generously acknowledged throughout her career. The need for royal endorsement would be brought home when her friend Max Gluckman was summarily expelled from his field-site in Zululand in 1938 after he had offended the Zulu regent and was never allowed to return. Sobhuza, by contrast, called a general meeting to reassure people of the motives of the 23-year-old \u2018umlungu\u2019 (white person); allowed Hilda to stay in the queen\u2019s royal enclosure at Lobamba; ordered one of his two senior wives to \u2018adopt\u2019 her; and selected a man from his royal regiment to protect, guide and translate for her in the early months, including on a three-month motoring tour of Swaziland in late 1934, for which he planned the route and provided the necessary royal references. He also generously shared information on all aspects of Swazi culture, from \u2018secret\u2019 and \u2018sacred\u2019 rituals to an in-depth knowledge of Swazi pre-colonial and colonial history, something which would influence her to develop what she termed a \u2018historical functionalist approach\u2019. Finally, he acted as a reader and censor of her early published articles. His unusual scholarly interest would, in fact, result in a drama around the politics of representation of Swazi culture in which Hilda played a leading role. The drama began when the Afrikaans short story writer Pieter Johannes Schoeman, who had done some months of intermittent fieldwork in Swaziland and been awarded a doctorate in volkekunde from the University of Stellenbosch, published a short article in the June 1935 edition of Bantu Studies entitled \u2018The Swazi Rain Ceremony\u2019. Schoeman had spent a term attending Malinowski\u2019s seminars in London and had been advised by Malinowski to publish chapters from his thesis before Hilda\u2019s research bore fruit. Malinowski had encouraged Hilda to leave the male side of Swazi culture to Schoeman. \u2018Remember that you work mainly from the \u201cwomen\u2019s point of view\u201d.\u2019 Given Malinowski\u2019s intervention, the journal editors (Doke and Rheinallt-Jones) put aside Mrs Hoernl\u00e9\u2019s concerns that \u2018the English was bad and the article poorly constructed\u2019. She then sent her critical summary version \u2018down to Miss Beemer [in Swaziland] for her information\u2019. On reading the notes, Hilda immediately recognized that there were glaring inaccuracies, quite apart from the static and shallow representations of Swazi ritual. She showed the summary to Sobhuza, who was outraged. \u2018How are we to know whom we can trust? Is there no check which can be held over so-called anthropologists?\u2019 Hilda agreed to his request that she publish an immediate rebuttal in Bantu Studies. Mrs Hoernl\u00e9 insisted that this critique be published in the September issue, a volume dedicated in her honour. In what was her first published article, Hilda questioned the authority of Schoeman\u2019s oral sources, indicating that his interviews were with marginal figures in the ritual; upbraided him for failing to corroborate the accuracy of his account with the Paramount Chief or Queen Mother; pointed out many inaccuracies, most notably his failure to recognize the central importance of the Queen Mother in the ritual; and insisted on the need to locate the ritual in an economic and political context instead of exotic beliefs in \u2018magical powers\u2019. She also took the unprecedented step of featuring a signed preface by Sobhuza \u2018corroborating the corrections\u2019. Incidentally, Hilda\u2019s field-notes reveal that her own extended two-part essay on the history of the male regimental (libutvo) system in Swaziland was proofread, or perhaps one should say censored, by Sobhuza before Hilda got the go-ahead to have it published in Africa in 1937. In fact, she explicitly proposed, as a matter of method, that anthropologists obtain an endorsement by indigenous leaders of their accounts before going to print. While the Schoeman case is revealing of what it says about the degree of intellectual dependence of anthropologists, including Hilda, on Sobhuza, it is also a fascinating moment in the fragile politics of South African social anthropology. It reveals the already growing divide between left-liberal English-speaking social anthropologists like Hilda and Afrikaner volkekundiges like Schoeman. While Mrs Hoernl\u00e9 was supportive and Malinowski diplomatic, advising Hilda to be generous to a man who had preceded her in the field, most South African anthropologists were angered by her intervention: none more so than Schoeman\u2019s doctoral supervisor, Werner Eiselen. As the head of the volkekunde department at Stellenbosch University, a member of the board of Bantu Studies and a leading voice in the South African Inter-University African Studies Committee, Eiselen was among the most powerful anthropologists in interwar South Africa. He later became a leading ideologue of apartheid. In an interview late in her life, Hilda confirmed that her attack on Schoeman \u2018cost me many friends and deeply antagonized Schapera\u2019. Two other incidents of conflict during Hilda\u2019s time of fieldwork confirm the depth of her loyalty to her Swazi patron and, in one case, her willingness to intervene outspokenly in public on his behalf. Hilda reported to Malinowski on her intervention at a meeting between the Swazi National Council and the Resident Commissioner, A.G. Marwick, in December 1934 in defence of the tradition of Swazi regimental youths beating to death a bull during their famous annual incwala ceremony. I listened in a dazed condition until one after another of the old indunas [headmen] got up and explained how the killing of the bull was an integral part, was \u2018chained to\u2019 the many other acts of the great national ceremony. Marwick then got up and said of course he realised etc. but other Europeans didn\u2019t etc. etc. \u2026 Well, all my Jewish reverence for old tradition and respect for the laws of another race forced me, despite that cautiousness which is also an integral part of my heritage, to contradict. So I pointed out that this custom was [well] known to the Europeans \u2026 [and] that the \u2018sports\u2019 of \u2018civilised\u2019 people, foxhunting and bullfighting were still allowed. The Council resolved that the killing of the bull would continue, although Sobhuza did later forbid excessive \u2018pummelling\u2019. The second incident dates to March 1935. Missionaries had laid an official complaint with the Resident Commissioner about Hilda\u2019s involvement in the promotion of Swazi tradition after her participation in the women\u2019s umcwasho ceremonies. They requested that the practice be outlawed and that Hilda be deported from Swaziland, one assumes because they felt that the ritual and her presence undermined their efforts to promote Christianity. The Resident Commissioner, a long-time friend of Sobhuza\u2019s and an enthusiast of anthropological writing about \u2018tradition\u2019, denied their request. The main challenge, however, was not winning over white missionaries, but securing the trust of Swazi informants. She recalled in later memoirs that the patronage of Sobhuza made her as many enemies as friends. To jealousy about her relationship with the Paramount Chief was added the deep suspicions of a conservative peasant society towards someone they regarded as another in a long line of \u2018strangers\u2019. The recent history of black\u2013white relations in Swaziland added further layers of suspicion. Her insightful discussion of Swazi stereotypes of Europeans in The Uniform of Colour (1947) drew in part on personal experience. She related how children in remote areas of the country cried at the sight of her, having long been told that whites kidnapped Swazi children. In more general terms, she indicated that the Swazi combined a respect for the magical technology of whites with a lack of respect for their morality: white cruelty being typically contrasted with the generosity and kindness of fellow Swazi. It was only through the work of language learning and patient communication with her informants that she was able to extend her social network beyond the world of royal wives and princesses. She long recalled the \u2018incredible night that I [first] dreamt in siSwati\u2019. The joys of fieldwork were followed by a frustratingly extended period of writing up. Her doctoral thesis was only finally submitted in August 1942 three months after Malinowski\u2019s death. The delay was partly because of the massively ambitious scale of her project, which produced in effect two books rather than one. She was also delayed by recurring bouts of malaria, which she had contracted in the field and, above all, by the devastating news that Brian Marwick, a relative of the Resident Commissioner who had conducted intermittent fieldwork during his seven years as a colonial official in Swaziland, was to get in ahead of her and publish a general ethnography of Swaziland through Cambridge University Press. Audrey wrote to Godfrey of the dispiriting impact this had on her new friend. \u2018Marwick\u2019s Swazi book is bad and I am sorry he cut across Hilda like that. She had three-quarters written of a general monograph and then changed to a special study of rank when she heard his book was coming out.\u2019 The publication of the thesis took a further five years, being severely affected by paper shortages during the Second World War. She was pushed into agreeing, to her life-long regret, that her study be published in two volumes by two different presses. Her contribution to political anthropology would surely have been more fully acknowledged had her study come out around 1940, the year of publication of African Political Systems, edited by Meyer Fortes and E.P. Evans-Pritchard, which is usually regarded as the book that introduced political anthropology as a new subfield within the discipline. All the same, An African Aristocracy met with rave reviews in a dozen journals. Even Evans-Pritchard, who felt that her study was thin on theory, praised the book as \u2018clear, concise, and relevant to its theme\u2019 with \u2018descriptions that could scarcely be bettered\u2019. Audrey drew attention to the underlying empathy that informed the book. \u2018Dr Kuper writes with affection for the people amongst whom she lived and worked for so long and with continual flashes of imaginative insight\u2019, rightly predicting that \u2018her description of the famous incwala is likely to become a classic for its richness of detail and interpretation\u2019. Max proclaimed it as \u2018the most interesting and vivid, and in many ways the most illuminating, account yet published of any southern Bantu tribe\u2019, a view endorsed by Monica in later references for Hilda. Indeed, her dense description of the incwala ritual would serve as the inspiration and empirical basis for his famous re-analysis of the ritual in terms of class conflict in his 1952 Frazer Lecture, later published as Rituals of Rebellion in South-East Africa (Reference Gluckman1954) and dedicated to Mrs Hoernl\u00e9. The seeds of his reinterpretation were clearly spelt out in his review. While other scholars might have felt aggrieved to see their rich descriptive narrative being appropriated in the service of their peer\u2019s theories, Hilda was pleased with the use to which Max was able to put her account. None of the reviewers fully appreciated the historical importance of her book. We should recall that when Hilda\u2019s first two monographs were published, African history had not been established as a scholarly discipline, and the methodologies of oral history and pre-colonial history had not been developed in any self-reflective way. This makes the opening section of her study all the more remarkable. To a much greater extent than any of her peers, including even the historically oriented Monica, Hilda\u2019s ethnography was grounded in a deep understanding of the pre-colonial history of the Swazi, based on more than a hundred oral interviews. It would only be in the 1980s through the research and writing of Philip Bonner that Hilda\u2019s historical groundwork was properly recognized. Hilda resumed her historical narrative in The Uniform of Colour. While this sequel rightly met with a more mixed response from reviewers, again her study must be judged in relation to the existing literature. The Uniform of Colour was the first systematic and coherent history of Swaziland in the colonial era and certainly the first to be told from a Swazi perspective. While her pre-colonial history had been constructed on the basis of Swazi oral tradition, her colonial history was crafted from the empirical details gleaned from documentary sources, including the Blue Books on Swaziland, Union Year Books and local tax registers, along with her interviews with Sobhuza, who had quite recently been involved in efforts to challenge the conquest in the British courts. Though conventional in its empiricism and chronological arrangement, it was highly unusual in tone. This was a strident critique of the \u2018oppressive\u2019 and \u2018underhand\u2019 paper conquest of Swaziland by the British during the 1880s and 1890s, an exposure of the deeply coercive nature of British colonial rule in the early 1900s driven by the imperatives of land acquisition, enforced taxation and migrant labour recruitment for the mining industry, as well as a lucid dissection of the complex of racist stereotypes and myths that underpinned these processes.\n\nShort stories, poems and political essays written in Johannesburg, 1942\u20131947 The years immediately following the submission of her thesis were enormously productive for Hilda, arguably her most prolific period as a writer. In addressing this first phase of her creative writing, I highlight the wide range of genres and themes with which she experimented during the 1940s, from private poetic expressions of longing for Leo, who was away at war, through partly autobiographical, partly fictional short stories to cultural and political essays penned for wide public consumption, as well as her scholarly writings. Her best-known publications of these years were the twin monographs discussed above. They presented a \u2018historical functionalist approach\u2019 as she termed it in an address delivered during her year-long presidency of the Anthropological Section of the South African Association for the Advancement of Science (1944). In later years she was increasingly assertive about the distinctiveness of her historical orientation and its departure from the ahistorical functionalist model of the founding fathers of the British school of social anthropology, Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown. Following her address she published a richly detailed stage-by-stage account of the ritual events involved in the marriage of a Swazi princess, Princess Bahushule, based on close participant observation (1945), using the same narrative technique she had developed in her documentation of the incwala ceremony. This was the first of three thickly descriptive accounts of traditional weddings. She also published an essay on \u2018The Swazi reaction to missions\u2019 (1946), which featured as a chapter in The Uniform of Colour. Last but not least, she contributed to the field of African urban anthropology with an article on \u2018voluntary associations\u2019 at her new field-site, the townships in Johannesburg, paying particular attention to African women\u2019s organizations known as stokvels, which offered financial security to desperately impoverished African families. It was co-authored with Selma Kaplan, one of Hilda\u2019s talented women graduates at Wits (where she lectured from 1941 to 1946), of whom Ruth First would be the most famous. Her impetus towards writing for a wider market is evident in her essays written as accompaniments to published collections of ethnographic photographs. The first was her considered introduction to A.M. Duggan-Cronin\u2019s photographs of the Swazi as featured in his series on The Bantu Tribes of South Africa. She also provided paragraph-length captions to each of the thirty-two photographs in the volume. The second was a popular essay, featuring alongside a selection of her fieldwork photographs of the incwala ceremony, published in 1947 in Libertas, a government-sponsored magazine known for its extensive use of visual materials. Hilda\u2019s primary motivation here was to generate wider interest in Swazi culture among white South African readers. For the visual historian of today, however, the contrast between the two sets of photographs is striking. Duggan-Cronin created a series of highly aestheticized, romantic portraits of individuals in traditional costume, with particular attention to royals like the Queen Mother. Hilda\u2019s account, which featured more fully in the sixty-one photographs published in her two monographs, presented Swazi society in collective terms, most dramatically of course in the ritual scenes of the incwala and the umcwasho, but also in many scenes of everyday activities, from women working in the fields to women mending reed mats within the royal enclosure. Representations of social change were equally prominent in her published visual record: they included photographs of the migrant labourers\u2019 buses, mine compounds in Swaziland, Christian weddings and political meetings of the Swazi National Association in Sophiatown. Hilda also penned dozens of poems in these years in three genres: love poems to Leo, war poems decrying the brutality of the Second World War and occasional \u2018ethnographic poems\u2019 written for publication with titles like \u2018Native Bus at Night\u2019 and \u2018The Black Man\u2019s Pass\u2019. In general, though, her poetry was intensely private, a form of catharsis during her painful five-year separation from Leo following his enlistment in the South African army in 1941. Theirs was, in many ways, a conventional marriage. Leo had been the breadwinner from the outset, with some of the expectations that went along with that role. Hilda took the job as a lecturer at Wits primarily because she needed the money. If her poems are anything to judge by, she was bereft. She visited Leo whenever possible, whether in military camps in the Eastern Transvaal, where she completed her first full draft of her thesis, or in Kenya, where he was posted for a time, or in Italy where Leo was sent after two years of service in North Africa. I read her war-time love poems as a catalyst in her career as a creative writer, an exploratory foray into writing about human emotions and inner psychology. While her first surviving poem, entitled \u2018Marriage\u2019, dates to January 1935, most of her love poems were written during the war years. Among her many beautiful love poems is this, entitled \u2018To Leo: Letter from Italy, June 1944\u2019. He wrote of poppies, yellow daisies, and an almond tree. He wrote a lovely song to me, the lover\u2019s song of Italy. He wandered through the villages defeated by despair. He wept beside the weeping child whose parents were not there. He heard the guns come near, and watched the bombers soar, And with his friends went marching through the wheat to war. He spoke to lonely peasant lads who did not know to fight. I felt the anguish that he felt from what he did not write. Hilda\u2019s daughter Jenny remembers that her mother was given to reciting snatches of poems and that poetry evoked intense emotion in her; she wept when reading to Jenny the war poems of Rupert Brooke. War-time anguish, separation and loss were, as we have seen, central features of her life history. Her political essays, by contrast, were written expressly for a general readership. She published half a dozen of these in South African literary and cultural magazines between 1943 and 1945. Most were fierce left-liberal critiques of white racism and segregation in South Africa. \u2018How Black Sees White (A Reply)\u2019, published in February 1944 in Trek challenged the stereotype of docile Africans presented in the shallow, psychologically based analysis of a previous writer. Black South African attitudes towards whites were, she insisted, complex and varied, profoundly shaped by African groups\u2019 different experiences of white domination and the different status positions of African individuals in South African society. \u2018What Is a Native?\u2019 (Trek, June 1945) presented a theoretically informed critique of white racist mythology. Drawing on the recent anthropological literature on race and racism that had emerged in reaction to the rise of Nazism, by authors like A.C. Haddon and Ruth Benedict, Hilda emphasized the lack of scientific validity of the biological concept of racial type that was coming to dominate white South African politics. She later recalled that this was the central emphasis of her social anthropology lectures at Wits. This kind of thinking was a revelation for white undergraduate students like Prudence Smith, later a prominent BBC radio presenter on Africa, who remembers having \u2018stumbled through my childhood, close to and yet far distant from the black people and children of my home\u2019 in a \u2018swept and trim\u2019 white suburb of Johannesburg. \u2018Hilda, her lectures and the warmth and care of her friendship, began to make sense of the world I lived in. She helped me to look into the fearful face of poverty and cultural dislocation as well as, on the other side, prejudice and self-interest.\u2019 The most interesting of her Johannesburg essays were those on the cultural politics associated with new media. In the only essay she ever published in Afrikaans, \u2018Die Oorlogsrolprent in Suid-Afrika\u2019 [\u2018The War Film in South Africa\u2019], Hilda drew attention to the crudely propagandistic nature of war films, with the death and brutal mutilation of human beings being celebrated in simplistic stories about the achievements of \u2018our heroes\u2019. While she would certainly have supported the necessity to fight \u2018a just war\u2019 against the evils of Nazism, her war poetry and this essay provide evidence of the depth of her aversion to violence. As we will see later, her fascinating study of the Hindu religion practised in Durban during the mid-1950s would reinforce her commitment to the politics of non-violence. In a lighter vein discussing with readers of the African Radio Announcer \u2018What I Expect from My Radio\u2019, Hilda made a case for the didactic value of this relatively new channel of mass communication, for more informed political debate, more prominent airing of African music and more sophisticated entertainment for what she clearly imagined as an intellectual middle class listenership. \u2018I want to hear ideas well expressed, good music well played, drama finely produced, news hot from scenes of action, comedy rich with humour.\u2019 She had already written about working-class responses to radio in the years after the introduction in 1940 of a war-time service to the Johannesburg townships. Here too she found that the didactic potential of the new technology was not being properly realized, as too many of the programmes were culturally insensitive, if not blandly propagandistic. These \u2018ethnographies of radio reception\u2019 are brief but intriguing soundings into social change in a modernizing South Africa. The most experimental of her writings were short stories. Hilda was a more prolific and better published short-story writer than has been acknowledged, even by the two scholars who have written about her ethnographic fiction. Most of her stories were published in cultural and literary magazines in South Africa, notably Trek, which featured \u2018Work Missus\u2019 (1943), \u2018Boy without a Job (Not Such a Bad Boy)\u2019 (1944), and \u2018The Orgy\u2019 (1948), its successor, South African Opinion (\u2018The Polygamist\u2019, 1947), The Forum (\u2018Wine of Destiny\u2019, 1946) and Africa South (\u2018The Amazement of Namahasha\u2019, 1956). Trek was a bilingual fortnightly left-liberal magazine which also published essays by other protest writers like Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing and Lionel Abrahams. A number of Hilda\u2019s stories were published abroad: \u2018Saturday at the Location\u2019 (1944) in Common Sense, an English literary journal edited by George Orwell, \u2018He Smelt White\u2019 was translated and published as \u2018Demone kam aus Johannesburg\u2019 [\u2018Demone comes from Johannesburg\u2019] in Der Tag in 1958, while another essay was translated and published in a French literary magazine. There are different ways of understanding her turn to ethnographic fiction. Nancy J. Schmidt, the first scholar to draw attention to the importance of Hilda\u2019s body of ethnographic fiction, locates her work in the most general of terms, as a hidden literary subgenre within social or cultural anthropology, one that the mainstream discipline had tended to disown. Writing at a time of heightened interest in the literary aspect of anthropology in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Schmidt remarked on the depth and breadth of Hilda\u2019s ethnographic fiction. On the other hand, Kerry Vincent proposes that we read her stories as a contribution to an emerging tradition of \u2018South African protest literature\u2019. The centrality of her critique of the migrant labour system and racially discriminatory laws, expressed in tragic stories of broken African lives, supports his case for the underlying political nature of her fiction. He also highlights the extent to which the image of Africans in her short stories, play and novel challenged the static and overly romanticized representation of the Swazi in British imperial literature, such as Rider Haggard\u2019s She. I would add that we need to locate her early ethnographic fiction in relation to her fieldwork, given the expressly autobiographical resonance of many, if not most, of the stories, in which the leading protagonist or even the first-person narrator is a young white woman researcher. While Hilda herself would retrospectively draw a sharp line between the genres of literature and social anthropology, and associate her literary experimentation with disillusion with the abstract new structuralist school of anthropology, her attitude to the discipline was still optimistic in the early to mid-1940s. She certainly remained active in new fields, despite the demands of teaching and writing. Apart from return trips to Swaziland in 1938 and 1941, her fieldwork was now conducted in the mines, prisons and townships of Johannesburg. It involved, in successive phases, conducting interviews with, and administering questionnaires to, Swazi mineworkers (1937 onwards), interviewing African women prisoners as part of a research project into penal reform (1938\u20139), interviewing Africans in townships about their reactions to radio broadcasting (1942) and leading a team of graduate women researchers, including Ruth First, to produce a study of African life in Western Native Township, Johannesburg. Provisionally titled \u2018Life in Poverty\u2019 (1945), this ambitious questionnaire-based study across 204 households was planned as a book, with chapters on household composition, standard of living, education, race, kinship and marriage, where they argued that African marriages in the township were stable and enduring, contrary to the standard image in the anthropological literature. The manuscript remained unpublished, probably because the research was cut short by Hilda and Leo\u2019s move abroad in 1947. I see Hilda\u2019s short stories as creative experiments arising out of her fieldwork encounters. While plot summaries can convey only a partial sense of the power of her creative imagination, they do indicate the kind of themes that she sought to explore in her experimental writing. Three of the stories are set in the townships of Johannesburg; another on a migrant labourer bus returning from Johannesburg to a \u2018native reserve\u2019. \u2018Work Missus\u2019 is her most powerful piece. The only one of her stories with a male protagonist, it tells of the progressive disillusionment of a male migrant labourer from Swaziland when confronted with the harsh realities of unemployment and white racism in the big city. Most of the stories are set in Swaziland. Here, too, the central theme is the clash between tradition and modernity. The most evocative of these, \u2018The Tooth\u2019 (Modern Reading, 1945), tells how a middle-aged Swazi woman implores a young white woman researcher to take her ailing child to the hospital in Mbabane. They are prevented from doing so by the patriarch of the homestead, who insists that the child\u2019s rotten tooth and hideously infected mouth be treated by a traditional healer. It is only when the girl is on the point of death that the young woman is given permission to take her to the hospital. Even though her life is saved by the doctor, in what is a typically bleak ending the story concludes with the young woman hearing the tragic news that her young baby has died of neglect back home. Most of the other Swazi short stories are tales of the young woman researcher\u2019s encounters with distasteful characters: a corpulent and lustful Swazi polygamist, an old missionary whose isolation made him turn to alchemy, a frenzied prophet of a new Christian sect, and a racist and anti-Semitic English guest-house owner (here set in the Transkei). In general, I am struck by the pessimistic tone and outcomes of these stories. Hilda sought to reveal the dark side of South African and Swazi society at a time of social and economic dislocation, one that is only partially exposed in her scholarship. She retrospectively characterized her short stories and poems as \u2018a safety valve\u2019, a form of psychological release in a time of personal and societal stress. They were attempts to channel this anxiety into creative forms that pushed the boundaries of her established mode of writing. I see them as literary experiments, the attempts of a scholar whose descriptive abilities were well recognized to find a new and different voice and medium by straddling the boundaries between the personal and the political, between the individual and the collective, between fact and fiction. It was only in her mature ethnographic fiction of the mid- to late 1950s that Hilda was able to make a more complete break with her identity as a fieldworker.\n\nA liberal family abroad, 1947\u20131952 Hilda\u2019s five-year interlude abroad was an unsettled time. It began with the delight of her falling pregnant shortly after their arrival in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where she had followed Leo, after his major mid-career decision to shift from law to sociology. A serious car accident in Johannesburg some years earlier had raised doubts as to whether Hilda would be able to bear children. Mary was born eighteen months after Jenny in Johannesburg, when the serious illness of Leo\u2019s sister forced Hilda and Leo to return for some months to South Africa. Hilda\u2019s outrage at the new apartheid government\u2019s policies is recorded in a political essay she penned after her return in which she compared the extent of democratic freedom and civil rights in the U.S. Constitution and as practised in the US North at least, with the complete absence of civil rights for black South Africans under apartheid. The Kupers were unwilling to stay in apartheid South Africa and set off for Coventry in England, where Leo was completing his doctoral thesis. Hilda felt isolated in this \u2018parochial\u2019 town. It had been badly bombed during the war and Leo\u2019s first field research focused on the process of urban reconstruction. Things were little better when he took up a lectureship at Birmingham. Here she suffered the trauma of having a stillborn child, and the disappointment of having to turn down a job as a Reader at the London School of Economics because of ill health. She published just one article during these five years, albeit arguably her best scholarly essay. This was her finely incisive analysis of the structure of kinship in Swazi society published in the seminal collection on kinship edited by Radcliffe-Brown and Daryll Forde (first edition 1950). She also produced a short overview of Swazi culture in a survey series designed for university students, dedicating it to Jenny and Mary in this and the numerous subsequent editions.\n\nA monograph, two plays and a novel written in Durban, 1952\u20131961 It can only have been with relief that Hilda heard the news of Leo\u2019s appointment as head of the Department of Sociology at the University of Natal, although she would surely have felt apprehension about the changing political climate in the country. They returned to South Africa in the early stages of the 1952 Defiance Campaign and threw themselves into anti-apartheid political activism from the outset. Indeed, their decade in Durban was the high point of their careers as left-liberal political activists, and their intellectual work was more deeply infused with their protest politics than has sometimes been acknowledged. Leo\u2019s role in South African liberal politics of this period has been more fully documented than that of Hilda. He began his first monograph, Passive Resistance in South Africa (1955), with an extended and vivid description of his participation in a joint ANC-Indian Congress political rally in \u2018Red Square\u2019 in Durban on 9 November 1952. His study situated the meeting in the passive resistance tradition of Mahatma Gandhi and provided a close reconstruction of the events of the 1952 Defiance Campaign. He does not mention whether Hilda was present with him at the meeting, although I think it is fair to assume that she would have been. They were among the founders in 1953 of the Liberal Party of South Africa, which remained their political home for a decade. The recollections of their colleagues, students and friends indicate that the Kuper home became a significant space for anti-apartheid political solidarity across the colour line, although the official history of the Liberal Party makes no mention at all of Hilda\u2019s contribution. Leo was more prominent in the public activities of the party. He was arrested in December 1956, along with Alan Paton and four Indian Congress members, for taking part in \u2018an assembly of Natives\u2019 in the Gandhi Library Hall in Durban, a meeting at which he and others launched a defence fund for the 156 Treason Trialists. This would later become the London-based International Defence and Aid Fund. Hilda had been arrested earlier in the year, along with Fatima Meer, when they marched with thousands of other women from Cato Manor in protest against new laws extending the pass system to \u2018non-European\u2019 women. By the late 1950s the Kupers were subject to increasing harassment from the apartheid state, with spies attending their sociology and anthropology lectures, and the threat of banning hanging over Leo. They were eventually forced to go into exile, at Hilda\u2019s instigation. This context of left-liberal anti-apartheid political activism deeply informed Hilda\u2019s anthropological research during her productive decade in Durban. Contrary to a recent claim that Hilda\u2019s ethnographic study of Indians in Durban is \u2018remarkably depoliticized\u2019, the politics of national belonging and racial discrimination in apartheid South Africa were at the very heart of her study. Her ethnography of the Hindu community of Durban, published in 1960 as Indian People in Natal and based on four years of fieldwork in three Indian suburbs between 1953 and 1957, was written as an explicit refutation of the National Party\u2019s view that South African Indians were \u2018strangers\u2019 who, it was often explicitly said, should be deported back to India rather than encouraged to integrate into a society to which they did not belong. This was despite the fact that they outnumbered Africans and whites in Durban when Hilda began her study. The underlying political argument of the book is that the Indian communities of Durban had become distinctively South African through a century-long process of migration and adaptation to their new environment and that their Indian cultural heritage, notably the relatively rigid caste system, no longer played a fundamental role in their family and religious life. These two central themes were explored in rich detail in this under-appreciated ethnography. In fact, the conclusion to her study hints that her own Jewish background encouraged in her an underlying association with Indians as fellow \u2018strangers\u2019 pushed to the margins. \u2018Like Jews \u2026, the Indians in South Africa can be, and have been used as a scapegoat by other national groups. Sufficiently wealthy to serve as bait for greed, too few to be feared, and, in the main, ideologically opposed to counter aggression with physical violence, their ethnic difference and cultural diversity serve as excuses for discrimination and oppression.\u2019 While the Jewish community had remained Hilda\u2019s main point of reference during her Johannesburg years, her decade in Durban saw her becoming integrated into a more cross-cultural left-liberal community of whites and middle-class Indians. Her daughter Jenny remembers visits to the homes of Hilda\u2019s Indian friends. JK: There was a family called the Singhs. He [Ashwin] was a doctor. And their daughter was a friend of mine. I adored her. And I remember going to their house and seeing them praying. They had little statues. It was all totally compelling \u2026 AB: Were your Indian friends well-to-do? JK: Yes. The ones we visited were. They wore saris and sumptuous garments \u2026 They were a very important part of our lives. When she [Hilda] was engaging with a particular community she really did connect. She and Mary sometimes accompanied Hilda on her fieldtrips. We would go to these amazing festivals which I absolutely loved. They would take us as quite young children. And we would see people walking over coals with bare feet, people with things piercing their tongues, people pulling wagons with hooks in their backs \u2026 and she would say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. They are not feeling any pain.\u2019 Hilda\u2019s thick description of these kavady rituals, involving participants going into states of trance and performing seemingly impossible feats of physical endurance in their altered states of consciousness, was the most unusual chapter. Jenny also vividly recalls visits to the Indian market in the city centre. We [the Kuper family] often used to go to the Indian market in Durban in the square, the big Indian market. We used to be the only white people there \u2026 I loved that place, the colourfulness of the Indian saris. And it was all just so vibrant \u2026 the colours and the smells. Hilda chose this as the scene with which to begin her ethnography, evoking an image of \u2018stalls crammed with oriental jewellery and trinketry, with a variety of lentils, rice, beans and oils, with betel leaf and areca nut, lime, camphor, and incense sticks, with curry powders, masala, all kinds of fruit and herbs, as well as with more familiar goods which themselves become unfamiliar in the excited atmosphere of oriental bargaining\u2019. If there is any lasting impression that the reader takes from the Indian People of Natal, it is surely of the richness, diversity and vibrancy of the Indian communities of Durban, with their complex and varied genealogies as third- or fourth-generation descendants of indentured and \u2018passenger\u2019 immigrants; their wide-ranging religious affiliations, predominantly Hindu, but also partly Muslim and partly Christian; their widely disparate socio-economic conditions; and, of course, their bewilderingly complex linguistic heritage (Tamil, Telegu, Gujarati, Hindustani and Urdu). As Hilda complained to Monica and Audrey in her letters, how could one possibly capture this enormous complexity in a single monograph? The acknowledgements are revealing of quite the extent of her reliance on Indian friends as intermediaries and testimony to the warmth of her relations with them. She thanked her two research assistants \u2018and close friends\u2019, Mrs Radhi Singh and Mrs Fatima Meer, then a Master\u2019s student of Leo\u2019s, with whom Hilda would co-author a short monograph entitled Indian Elites (Reference Kuper and Meer1956); seven Indian health educators, her colleagues at Sidney Kark\u2019s Institute of Family and Community Health, who accompanied her on visits to Indian homes and established a network of contacts for her; the Pandits and Swamis, who shared with her their religious knowledge and hosted her in their temples and houses; as well as half-a-dozen Indian intellectuals who had read and \u2018corrected\u2019 her manuscript, following the precedent she had established in her work in Swaziland. Hilda\u2019s connection with the community and culture she was studying had in some senses been closer in Swaziland. In Durban she neither lived in the Indian suburbs, which was illegal for a white researcher in apartheid South Africa, nor became fluent in Hindi. She discontinued lessons with her Brahmin teacher once she realized that \u2018his version of the language was \u201ctoo high\u201d for the man on the street\u2019. However, her ethnography demonstrates that she developed a deep understanding of Hindu religion and philosophy: its rich history, its literature, its changing rituals in the South African context and especially its underlying ethos. She wrote to Monica that she had not intended to immerse herself in the sacred literature of Hinduism, but had been forced to do so as she became aware of its continued importance to religious practice among South African Hindus. It is evident that her fieldwork experience had a profound impact on her own spiritual identity and philosophical outlook, which came to be marked by a universalism and inclusiveness, a breadth of vision, an appreciation of the core values of non-violence and compassion, which are at the heart of Eastern religions and which, in Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s satyagraha tradition, became associated with the politics of non-violent protest in South Africa. She wrote to Audrey: \u2018Strangely enough, I\u2019ve decided that I am religious, [though] not in any orthodox way \u2013 which would make life much easier.\u2019 Hilda\u2019s book was reviewed in surprisingly few journals, probably because of its publication by a South African press. Again, Max was her most generous reader. He described it as \u2018a studious, though fascinating, analysis of the social relations of Indians and their culture\u2019, one which \u2018illuminates South Africa from an unusual angle\u2019 and \u2018deals penetratingly with the theme of adaptation\u2019. He did have a close knowledge of her study, as she did much of the writing up during an energized year at Manchester on a Simons Fellowship. In the literature on the history of anthropology in South Africa, Hilda\u2019s Indian study is seldom mentioned, if at all. What was its anthropological significance in the broader view? First, it was an important contribution to the emerging field of South African urban anthropology. Hilda\u2019s book was published before the famous \u2018Xhosa in Town\u2019 trilogy under the directorship of Philip Mayer and the analysis of social groups in Langa by Monica Wilson and Archie Mafeje. Her study was based on lengthier and much more immersed fieldwork than these better-known urban studies: Mayer worked largely through questionnaires, given the political difficulties of working in East London townships during an intensely volatile period, and the relatively inexperienced Mafeje\u2019s fieldwork was brief by comparison and done under time pressure. Second, as I have argued in the case of An African Aristocracy, few scholars have recognized the historical importance of her work. Here again the opening section of her book provided a detailed and pioneering history, here of South African Indians based on a combination of oral and documentary sources: extensive family interviews about ancestors presented as case histories; shipping records to track patterns of migration; and reports of the Protector of Indian Immigration. Third, the body of the text advanced our understanding of the history of religion, especially of religious ritual, in South Africa. In both these senses, it furthered the study of social change in South Africa. While its publication by a relatively small press might have contributed to its neglect, it is difficult to avoid the impression that the book\u2019s limited appreciation related to its failure to conform to the binary categories within which works of South African anthropology have been evaluated: studies of traditional African culture and/or African culture in transition; and later studies of traditional African religious systems and African forms of Christianity. It is against the background of this anthropological research that I propose to read her second, more mature phase in writing ethnographic fiction. To begin with, we should note that Hilda returned to fictional writing only in the mid- to late 1950s, producing at least one short story, two plays and a novel within a few years. Given my focus here on depth rather than range, I will provide a close analysis of just one of these important works: her best-known and favourite offspring, A Witch in My Heart. She wrote the play in Durban between 1956 and 1958, when it was performed by African medical students from the University of Natal. Explicitly subtitled \u2018A Play Set in Swaziland in the 1930s\u2019, it is a tragedy with Shakespearian overtones, a play that makes rich use of the techniques of dramatic irony, soliloquys and foreshadowing, and reveals a heightened sense of drama reflected in storms, lightning and a dark preoccupation with the workings of witchcraft. It is essentially a story of culturally inappropriate love, of the romantic love between a Swazi man (Sikova) and his favourite but barren co-wife (Bigwapi), of the consequent jealousy of her two co-wives (the sisters Big Lahlophe and Little Lahlophe), and the negative judgement of his wider family in this patriarchal society. It tells of the devastating consequences that result from all this: his humiliation when he goes to Johannesburg to find work in order to pay for traditional medical intervention, his falling in with bad company, his arrest and imprisonment, and finally his return home only to find that his beloved is on the point of being expelled from the homestead, having been found guilty of witchcraft after a traditional healer (sangoma) had confirmed his co-wives\u2019 suspicions that Bigwapi had caused one of them to bear a still-born baby. The play ends with the broken husband on the point of returning to the dark city, no longer feeling that he can remain in his rural home, and the barren co-wife about to be cast adrift from the homestead and, in her traumatized state, proclaiming that there is \u2018a witch in my heart\u2019. The settings thus shift from the Swazi homestead to Johannesburg before returning to a scene of physical, social and spiritual death back at the homestead. The central ethnographic themes are clear: kinship relations in traditional African societies, notably relationships between husbands and co-wives in polygamous societies; patriarchal male attitudes towards wives, in particular barren wives; the enormous power of the traditional belief in witchcraft and the devastating personal consequences that can result from beliefs in seemingly abstract, intangible dark forces; and the disruptive impact that migrant labour and city life can have on traditional African values and families. The theme of tragic love is also at the heart of the other play and the novel she wrote at the time. While her novel was only published in New York in 1965 under the title A Bite of Hunger, she had written the first draft in Manchester in 1958. The novel is set in interwar Swaziland with a young woman (here a princess) as its central character. Here too the leading protagonist, Lamtana, is caught between tradition and modernity, and comes to be accused of witchcraft. \u2018The Hunger\u2019 in the title refers both to the play\u2019s setting in a time of drought and to Lamtana\u2019s deep desire for learning and books, and the magical powers she associates with them. Hilda based the character and experiences of Lamtana on one of the Swazi queens whom she had known intimately. The Decision is a play about the love of a young South African Indian woman for a political activist involved in the Indian Congress, about her parents\u2019 opposition to her choice, their attempts to force her into an arranged marriage with a man she did not love, and her tragic decision to commit suicide rather than face an awful future trapped in a loveless marriage. Hilda indicated in private correspondence that her work had emerged directly out of her fieldwork encounters among Indian communities in Durban in the mid-1950s. We know that the play was performed by Indian medical students at the University of Natal in June 1958. Hilda indicated that an Indian couple came up to speak to her immediately afterwards and threatened to sue her as they thought that the play exposed their own family history. She vowed that she had never met them but, given the sensitivity around the subject, she put off revising the play and in fact was working on a final version when she died in April 1992. What was Hilda\u2019s underlying motivation in crafting A Witch in My Heart? Drawing on postcolonial theory, Kerry Vincent has argued that the play sought to present a Western feminist critique of African patriarchy, polygamy and witchcraft. The first problem with this interpretation is that the play was written in the late 1950s in South Africa rather than the late 1960s in the United States when feminist theory came to the fore. Hilda was in fact critical of feminist anthropology. She bravely presented an outspoken defence of the polygamous family structure in traditional Swazi society in a keynote address at an international conference in 1975 on the changing status of women in the modern world. Ever independent of mind, she provocatively argued that co-wives in a traditional polygamous African society were more socially secure than the modern woman in their alienated, overly competitive American society. The second problem is that her attitude towards Swazi traditional beliefs, including polygamy and witchcraft, was always more ambiguous than this analysis would suggest. Indeed, her daughter Mary recalls that: Some concepts from her fieldwork \u2013 a belief in witchcraft for example, certainly came across to us as children as valid realities, and at one point in Durban she performed an exorcism in our house for someone, possibly one of the people who worked for us. Certainly when she talked about say, in Swaziland, a snake appearing and being addressed as an ancestral spirit, she presented this as reality, not as an alien or strange practice \u2026 I also clearly remember the model of the polygamous family structure being presented in a favourable light. While it is fair to read her play as a critical commentary on patriarchy in traditional African society, her technique was not to adopt the voice of the Western feminist but to seek to reveal the painful inner journey of the woman who suffers from these attitudes, in particular Swazi attitudes to barren women. I see her fiction as being closely related to her scholarly work at the time. Her study of the Indian communities in Durban was about attempting to engage with and then convey a sense of an inner world, the world of belief and spirituality, of which the ritual public expressions were but the overt manifestation. Likewise, the play is primarily concerned with the inner rather than the outer, with emotion rather than behaviour. As she explicitly indicated in her introduction to the 1970 edition, the play is \u2018less about witchcraft and more about the heart \u2013 a symbolic heart reflecting deep human emotions \u2013 love, hate, jealousy, hope, and despair\u2019. She went on to explain that ethnographic fiction gave her the freedom to explore matters of the heart. She contrasted this with the constraint she had often felt as a scholarly writer working from within a policed, bounded \u2018discipline\u2019 with its more rigid conventions and style. Elsewhere she described ethnographic fiction as an alternative to the stiflingly abstract, depersonalized and lifeless language of structuralism that came to dominate mainstream social anthropology in the 1950s. The writer of fiction, on the other hand, is allowed greater freedom of expression and imagination. She is expected to personalize general experiences, is permitted to develop her own style and eccentricities, and encouraged to avoid technical formulations and conventions in making her own commitments. She may deliberately use the ambiguity of words to extend the reader\u2019s perception. Her history may not be chronological nor social, nor her cosmology computable. She may take for granted that the mind sets its own pace as it wanders through an existential labyrinth. It is also possible to read the play autobiographically, in line with my reading of her short stories. As noted earlier, Hilda had at one stage feared that she herself was barren (and we also know that she bore a still-born child, as one of the co-wives does in the play), so it is fair to assume that her empathetic portrait of the conflicted female protagonist drew in part on personal experience. She is thoroughly persuasive in conveying the injustice of the hostile and judgemental attitudes of Swazi family members towards Bigwapi as well in analysing, in rich ethnographic detail, the sense in which an infertile woman was regarded in Swazi society as socially worthless. We know relatively little about the play in performance. Mary Kuper recalls that, at the age of nine, she and her elder sister watched the play from upstairs overlooking the stage, when it was first performed in a hall at the University of Durban Medical Campus. Most of its stage life was in the classrooms of Swaziland in the 1961 Zulu language translation, Inhliziyo Ngumthakathi by Hilda\u2019s University of Natal colleague, Trevor Cope. Long before Lucy Dlamini taught the 1978 siSwati translation to her students at the University of Swaziland as a Professor of African Literature, she encountered the Zulu language text in junior secondary school in Mbabane in 1966 and 1967. She and her classmates \u2018loved\u2019 the play. \u2018I don\u2019t know of anyone who never loved it. The response has always been positive.\u2019 Perhaps because of Hilda\u2019s success in portraying Bigwapi\u2019s fate with such empathy, \u2018the girls were better readers than the boys\u2019, but boys and girls alike were highly entertained. We never even knew it was a translation \u2026 It was very powerful. It was very interesting. It was funny. It mirrored Swazi culture. The men going to the mines, buying gifts for the wife, and then usually in a polygamous situation, the husband will be more in love with one of the wives \u2026 The play was also performed at least once by undergraduate anthropology students at Manchester University. When Max mentioned her novel and plays to his colleague John Barnes in January 1965, \u2018he asked me why I did not have a play reading for my first-year students with your [witchcraft] play \u2026 This seems an excellent idea to me: one could have one of the students standing in front of a blackboard on which one could draw the genealogy [of Sikova\u2019s extended family that features on the opening page] so that who they are was made clear and get them to read the different parts.\u2019 She thought it an excellent idea. \u2018I confess that I am more excited about it than any of my anthropological writing.\u2019 On the basis of his experiment, Max persuaded the International African Institute to publish an English language edition in 1970. He prompted her to write what was an excellent introduction organized around the theme of women as wives and mothers in Swazi society. Max wrote a short preface. Kerry Vincent, based at the University of Swaziland in 2000, indicated that the 1978 siSwati translation of the play \u2018is still used extensively not only as an aid in teaching siSwati, but also as a point of departure for discussing traditional Swazi culture. It is perhaps not too great an exaggeration to suggest that the play has influenced the way in which many Swazi youth perceive themselves.\u2019 Its life as a classic is far from over. Macmillan has published a fresh edition of the play for use in schools in Swaziland as part of a \u2018new series of plays and screenplays written by playwrights and screenwriters all over the world\u2019.\n\nBetween two worlds, Los Angeles and Swaziland, 1961\u20131992 Hilda found her last years in Durban and the move to Los Angeles in October 1961 enormously stressful. The decision to leave South Africa was a very difficult one and was driven primarily by her: Leo was more ambivalent but also a little less anxious about the future. Hilda had taken a post as Senior Lecturer in the Social Anthropology Department at the University of Natal after Jack Krige\u2019s sudden death in 1959. She was a gifted teacher. Her most talented undergraduate, Eleanor Preston-Whyte, remembers her as \u2018an extraordinarily good lecturer\u2019. But the apartheid government was closing in on white liberal universities. The Extension of Universities Act of 1958 made it illegal for African and Indian students to attend white universities. The Medical School at Natal University, which trained African nurses and doctors, was put under the Native Affairs Department and the University of South Africa. Hilda had close contact with the nurses, as she was then researching a chapter on African nurses for Leo\u2019s An African Bourgeoisie (Reference Kuper and Kuper1965). By 1960 Hilda had come to the view that their lives were unsafe, given their political commitments, that their children\u2019s education and well-being would be hampered if they did not go abroad and that Leo\u2019s burgeoning career as a sociologist needed a wider stage. But her private correspondence reveals that she felt an enormous sense of guilt about abandoning her fellow activists in the Liberal Party, her friends in the Indian community and her liberal colleagues at the University of Natal. Their departure would create an irreparable breach with many Liberal Party members, notably Alan Paton, who \u2018was very critical and hostile with us for having left South Africa and broke what was once a wonderful friendship\u2019. Their decision was so fraught that they chose not to inform their daughters about this radical change in their family life. While Hilda may have felt that their move to Los Angeles was a necessary evil done in the interests of their children, Jenny still feels a sense of pain at the memory of being \u2018kidnapped\u2019 from a South African city which she loved for colourfulness, vibrancy and dynamism, and where she felt politically connected. Neither Jenny nor Mary felt at home in the United States, and they both emigrated to England at a relatively young age. Hilda wrote to Audrey after a fortnight in Los Angeles: I have died quietly inside for days and feel quite empty with bereavement. For what we did originally for the children \u2013 taking them from South Africa \u2013 has brought nothing. What can children get here in this harsh country? Anti-Russian propaganda in the schools, a narrow American nationalism, a hardness that none of us have, that we don\u2019t feel like \u2026 Oh Audrey, if only I could undo the past two weeks \u2026 I feel that I have betrayed all my own values by this decision \u2026 Mary recalls: \u2018I have a clear memory of finding her sitting at her desk in L.A. with tears in her eyes. She would say that she just had hay-fever.\u2019 Hilda\u2019s letters reveal a sense of restlessness through her first decade in the United States. In 1967, having effused about her seven-month return fieldtrip to Swaziland, she wrote of the pain of having to return to the United States. \u2018I left with great sadness, feeling that I could do something more meaningful than teaching anthropology to American students.\u2019 She chose not to take an American passport, trading her South African passport for a Swazi one when she was offered citizenship in 1970. After retirement from her position as Chair of Anthropology at UCLA in 1977, she seriously considered relocating to Swaziland, but Leo\u2019s lack of fluency in siSwati and his reluctance at giving up his public position as an international scholar meant that they stayed in Los Angeles. When interviewed in 1981 about her recently published biography of Sobhuza II (Reference Kuper1978), she told the journalist from the Rand Daily Mail that she felt more Swazi than American, proudly revealing that her children had been given Swazi names. The history of her thirty years in Los Angeles may be considered a time in which Hilda lived between two worlds: those of UCLA, where she found an intellectual home with stimulating colleagues and bright students, and Swaziland, which became her new spiritual home. She made more than a dozen return trips to Swaziland. Mary recalls her great surprise at her realization on the family\u2019s visit for the independence celebrations in 1968 that her mother was more than \u2018a scatty housewife\u2019, prone to losing keys and forgetting to pick the children up from school. I think she was very, very happy there. She was valued. She was respected. We had a kind of status as her family. It was very odd to realize that she had this other life. It was pretty amazing that she managed to keep it going. Sobhuza gave Hilda permission to have Jenny, then a film and media student at UCLA, make a film about the incwala ceremony. This rare, private twenty-minute footage again illustrates Hilda\u2019s interest in exploring other media. It introduced Jenny to \u2018her Swazi world, which until then had been a hidden part of her life. I saw her in a completely different light \u2013 so vibrant.\u2019 One of Leo\u2019s UCLA graduate students, Bob Edgar, witnessed \u2018how royally they [Hilda and Leo] were treated\u2019 at the 1973 celebrations of Sobhuza\u2019s 50th year on the throne. Hilda was one of the three main speakers at the televised funeral of Sobhuza in 1982. On her last return trip of 1991 she was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Swaziland. There is much more to be said about Hilda\u2019s years in Los Angeles than her feelings of dislocation. Her fifteen years as a teacher, writer and editor at UCLA were highly productive. A full account of her American years would have to examine the contribution of her two significant edited volumes of 1965, the second with Leo, which emerged out of the work she did as organizer of the UCLA African Studies Center\u2019s seminar series. They were significant collections on the themes of urbanization and law in Africa that straddled disciplines and featured a host of internationally acclaimed scholars including Jan Vansina, Immanuel Wallerstein, Michael Banton and Max Gluckman. They pushed her in the direction of the more universal anthropological orientation of her late career: of her view of anthropology as a humanistic discipline with an emphasis on the importance of comparative and cross-cultural study. One would also have to examine in detail her cultural and symbolic turn of the early 1970s. She had gone back to Swaziland to re-examine ritual in the context of social change, and was struck by the degree of cultural continuity. She wrote a succession of articles which were published in the most prestigious anthropological journals between 1971 and 1973, which examined the themes of clothing, space and symbolism in ritual contexts, the last prompted by the writings of Victor Turner, to whom she dedicated the poem \u2018To Vic Who Blazed the Trail\u2019. Above all, one would have to provide a sensitive account of the difficulties and frustrations of writing the official biography of Sobhuza over six years, from 1972 to 1978. It was something she took on only after much deliberation, out of a sense of service and obligation to her former patron and with some prompting from Leo. It proved to be a massive endeavour and ultimately \u2018a burden\u2019. The strictures of the official committee appointed to oversee the project meant that she was not free to write exactly what she wished to, and her somewhat sanitized account of Sobhuza\u2019s anti-democratic politics in the years after independence can only be properly evaluated in this light. The main obstacle was that in 1974 she lost a tin trunk containing all her taped interviews of two years, masses of documentary material and numerous cherished gifts from Swazi friends. It was only with Leo\u2019s support that she could be persuaded to continue. One would also need to appreciate her achievement, in this richly illustrated 374-page work, in balancing insights into the private life of Sobhuza with those relating to his skilful statesmanship, which she so greatly admired, his resilience in keeping at bay the forces of British colonial authority and the South African state, and charting a course based on cultural nationalism, which ultimately saw Swaziland through to independence. Most reviewers praised the work, although some questioned the degree to which her relationship with Sobhuza and the political authorities in Swaziland had compromised her ability to be objective. One would also need to take account of her contribution as a teacher and mentor of a new generation of women anthropologists. At one time she had sixty first-year students in her class and seven doctoral students under her supervision, four of whom were working on southern Africa. There was a constant flow of South African students from the University of Natal and visitors from Swaziland, including Ben Magubane and Anthony Ngcobo, Leo\u2019s research assistants in Durban who came over to further their graduate studies, and later Thoko Ginindza, Hilda\u2019s research assistant from Swaziland who took an M.A. in African Studies at UCLA and then worked on a Ph.D. under Hilda while registered at another university. Hilda\u2019s former graduate student and research assistant, Sondra Hale, still vividly recalls Hilda\u2019s contribution as teacher, mentor and female role model. Hilda had the posture of authority and an upper-class theatrical accent to go with it. In graduate seminars Hilda was brilliant as a facilitator. She talked just enough and set an atmosphere that was comfortable for people to contribute. She was particularly exacting when it came to writing. I must have revised my 550-page dissertation on Nubians in Sudan some six or seven times, and I felt she still was not happy with it in the end \u2026 Those of us who knew her work knew that she was a brilliant writer so her comments on our writing were taken seriously. Another former student Barbara Meyerhoff, who later produced famous documentary films of American Jewish culture, eloquently described Hilda\u2019s style of supervision as \u2018a forcing of patience, a reflectiveness, a kind of listening\u2019. She claimed that working under Hilda was a \u2018transformative experience\u2019 that allowed her to develop a more humanist attitude towards others. Her writing and teaching needed to be balanced with her family commitments, ensuring that Leo was happy and affirmed. One would certainly also have to take account of her return late in life to fiction. She had taught courses on ethnographic fiction, anthropology and literature, and on anthropology and biography during the 1970s, attended conference panels on these themes in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and had written an incisive self-reflective essay on biographical writing in African history, which foregrounded the complexity of the relationship between the biographer and his or her subject. She wrote to her students and friends of her desire to return to creative writing, but was never able to devote as much time as she would have liked to her fiction. Sadly, she died before being able to author the introduction to the volume of plays, poems and short stories published in the year of her death by the University of Madison-Wisconsin. Finally, one would also wish to record her qualities as a person. Her colleague M.G. Smith referred to her having retained a sense of youth and a bubbling sense of joy throughout her life. Her daughter Mary touchingly remembers her as \u2018very expansive\u2019. She talked to everybody. She had the ability to connect to people extraordinarily well. She was such a source of warmth. You were lucky to be in her sphere."}, {"url": "https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf1b69n737/", "page_content": "Description Hilda Kuper (1911- ) was a professor of Anthropology at UCLA (1963-78) specializing in South Africa, Swaziland, and the Swazi.

She studied at the University of the Witwatersrand and, afterwards, at the London School of Economics under Malinowski.\n\nDoctoral fieldwork and anthropological career\n\nIn 1934, Kuper won a fellowship from the International African Institute to study in Swaziland. In July of that year, while at an education conference in Johannesburg, she met Sobhuza II, paramount chief and later king of Swaziland. With assistance from Sobhuza and Malinowski, Kuper moved to the royal village of Lobamba and was introduced to Sobhuza's mother, the queen mother Lomawa. Here Kuper learned siSwati and pursued her fieldwork.

She grew up in Johannesburg, South Africa and received her anthropological training with Winifred Hoernl\u00e9 at the University of Witwatersrand and Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics. Kuper is best known for her research in Swaziland where she became a citizen in 1970; Hilda took a \u201cSwazi point of view,\u201d arguing that Westernization weakened women\u2019s position. Very little has been written about Hilda\u2019s collaboration with Swazi anthropologist, Thoko Ginindza (1942-1996).\n\nThough nothing has been published about their Swazi artifact collection at the UCLA Fowler Museum, these Swazi women\u2019s clothing and adornment items provide tangible evidence of the transracial and transnational collaboration between Kuper and Ginindza.\n\nHilda and her husband, Leo Kuper, came to UCLA after increasing police surveillance made staying in South Africa untenable. Hilda eventually became a Professor in Anthropology at UCLA. Thoko wrote to Hilda (whom she knew from Swaziland) in 1967 asking for Hilda\u2019s assistance to attend UCLA, where Thoko earned a MA in African Studies in 1972. Their shared research emphasized the impact of colonization and the traditional Swazi aristocracy on women\u2019s roles in Swaziland, manifested through gendered clothing norms.\n\nThis presentation will provide a history and visual analysis of the Swazi collection and their research relationship through an exploration of correspondence between Kuper and Ginindza and fieldwork photographs from the Hilda Kuper Papers held in the UCLA Special Collections.\n\nAbby at UCLA Fowler Museum with the Teresa Thoko Ginindza Swazi collection. November 2016, photo taken by Erica P. Jones, Assistant Curator of African Art\n\nGoals\n\nThe goal of this presentation is to raise awareness about the Swazi collection held at the UCLA Fowler Museum and to investigate the long-term research relationship and collaboration between women that crossed racial and national borders. This collaboration occurred between a Black Swazi woman anthropologist and a Jewish Rhodesian/South African woman anthropologist. I want to emphasize how museum collecting and anthropological theorizing is a collaborative project and not one done in isolation. I especially want to underscore how women of color and indigenous women did and do much of the ethnographic labor/theorizing that made and make these collections and writing projects possible. Lyn Schumaker\u2019s Africanizing Anthropology (2001) has been especially influential for my thinking. My dissertation explores theories related to these politics of knowledge production and canon creation in much more depth. This presentation is part of a larger project which investigates how and why Jewish women social scientists throughout the Jewish and African diasporas wrote about Black women and how that reflected Jewish women\u2019s positionality within racial, political, class and other institutional and professional networks. Here I center on the material connections between Thoko Ginindza and Hilda Kuper, cross-referencing the multiple forms of evidence that document the formation of the Thoko Ginindza Swazi artifact collection at the UCLA Fowler Museum as well as images of the artifacts which exist in the collection. I interweave the following sources with a strong emphasis on the objects themselves:\n\ncorrespondence between Thoko and Hilda about the collection\n\nThoko\u2019s description of the objects she collected both in the digitized description of the collection and her handwritten and photocopied field notes that accompanied the collection (both of which Erica P. Jones at the Fowler Museum shared with me)\n\nphotographs of the objects in the collection that I took when I visited the museum in 2016\n\nphotographs from the Hilda Kuper Papers that display the clothing and adornment items found in the collection (some of the photos show Hilda wearing some of these types of items)\n\nThoko\u2019s writings including a paper she wrote in 1971 \u201cDress in Swaziland\u201d for Hilda\u2019s anthropology course & Hilda\u2019s related 1973 article \u201cCostume and Identity\u201d which drew upon Thoko\u2019s work\n\nThoko\u2019s Statement of Purpose (1974) written to gain admission to a PhD in Anthropology at UCLA & Hilda\u2019s corrections to it\n\nHilda\u2019s academic and creative writings about Swaziland and Thoko\u2019s development -oriented writing about Swazi women\n\nMy main argument is that Thoko\u2019s labor (collecting, writing, researching) powerfully informed Hilda\u2019s writing and theorizing. In turn, Hilda enabled Thoko\u2019s transnational access to UCLA. Thoko collected artifacts and data for Hilda. Thoko wrote about Swazi clothing and adornment and Hilda utilized this information for her own writing. The collection at UCLA would not exist without their collaborative partnership. In addition, I argue that Thoko was working in a more \u201cfeminist\u201d direction than Hilda was comfortable with, and Thoko critiqued Swazi patriarchal systems in a way that Hilda did not, except for in her creative writings.\n\nOrganization\n\nIntroduction: How did I learn about their collaboration and the Swazi artifact collection at UCLA? Correspondence and detailed explanations of clothing items mentioned in Thoko\u2019s letter.

I came across letters between Hilda and Thoko in which Hilda asked Thoko to collect Swazi artifacts to form an object collection at the ethnology museum at UCLA .\n\n\u201cI spoke to George Elkin, who is in charge of the ethnological museum at UCLA, and he is very interested in getting as full a collection of Swazi materials as possible, but the amount of money available is limited. He thinks that he could get $500 for it and has asked me to arrange things with you so that the money be spent most advantageously. I suggested full sets of traditional clothing for men, women and children would be a starting point, but pointed out to him that the leopard skin loincloth now costs an enormous amount. I wonder if you could give me an estimate? It would be very good to start with clothing, including sample bead work and then to other handicrafts.\u201d -Hilda Kuper to Thoko Ginindza, March 13, 1975\n\nHilda Kuper Papers, Box 24, Folder 20, UCLA Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library\n\nIn turn, Thoko reported on which types of objects she managed to find and purchase.\n\nThoko Ginindza to Hilda Kuper, April 16, 1975, Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 24, Folder 20\n\n\n\nThis section of the letter states: I have placed an order for some emagcebesha and tingciba specimens for the Anthro museum. But as you have realized, the $500 will not go very far, particularly as the postage will cost quite a bit. Emagcebesha now cost E1.50, a piece Indlamu starts at E16.00. It will take some time to get the things, but I will send anything I can get and then you reimburse me. I will send the things directly to you. The hide for the loin skin [emajobo] cost between E5.00 and E6.00 a piece, and it\u2019s very difficult to get as people have to poach. I will next be working on those and tidvwaba. I am trying to concentrate on dress and costume for this year, but I have collected a few other items, old emakhuba [?] and imugcwembe [?] and other things as I come across them.\n\nI will explain the objects described in this letter below.\n\nThe objects described in Thoko\u2019s letter\n\nEmagcebesha: beaded necklaces (Betty Sibongile Dlamini \u201cWomen and Theatre for Development in Swaziland\u201d a doctoral dissertation, 2008, p. 141) [Note that ema- is the plural form, so this is the plural version of ligcebesha, described below. Thank you to Beth Rosen-Prinz for this explanation of singular and plural forms of terms included in this presentation.]\n\nTingciba: plural form of ingciba, a type of beaded necklace included in Thoko\u2019s Swazi collection and discussed in her paper \u201cDress in Swaziland\u201d; ingciba are discussed below\n\nIndlamu: unmarried girls wore this for the reed dance. It is a short skirt, of beadwork on cloth, which is very expensive so typically one would be shared among all the girls in the family. A substitute would be a cotton skirt called a indiloko, which Thoko explained came from the Afrikaans term \u201conder rok\u201d or petticoat (Ginindza, \u201cDress in Swaziland,\u201d 1971, p. 8). From the digitalized description of the Swazi collection at the Fowler Museum (catalogue no. X76-376): \u201cWaistband of brass studded blue cloth and beads which is worn by unmarried women during the Reed Dance (umhlanga). Also worn at other occasions such as weddings.\u201d For a contemporary video of umhlanga and contemporary critiques of the ceremony, see below.\n\nIndlamu in the Thoko Ginindza Swazi collection, X76-376 and also in the Hilda Kuper Papers, photograph collection, Box 45, Folder 14, 1973\n\n\u201cThe Umhlanga, a Swazi cultural tradition that celebrates chastity and virginity, attracts tens of thousands of women from across the country. On the final day of the festival, the young women, or \u2018maidens\u2019, parade bare-breasted at the royal village. Traditionally, the king is allowed to choose one of the women as a wife, but in recent years the festival has been more about preserving a cultural heritage. However, there is growing criticism from human rights groups who claim cultural ceremonies are enforced in Swaziland by the last absolute monarchy in Africa. -Sara Assarsson, The Guardian,\n\n22 Sep 2016\n\nSara Assarsson also explains that families who do not send their daughters for the umhlanga must pay a fine in the form of an animal like a cow or goat. Girls are rewarded if they participate with a payment of 500 rand, which for many families is a strong motivation (2/3 of Swazis are living below the poverty line).\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/sep/22/swaziland-reed-dance-cultural-celebration-or-sleazy-royal-ritual-umhlanga\n\nThe girls who participate in umhlanga are unmarried, and without children, and range in age from 5 to 22. The ceremony provides a reed tribute and dance to the Queen Mother and also serves to prove the girls\u2019 \u201cchastity\u201d (Dlamini, 2008, p. 136).\n\nBetty Dlamini makes a powerful argument that \u201cthe umhlanga dance is\u2026 a political mechanism \u2026to control girls\u201d (p. 143). B. Dlamini analyzes two conflicting songs that young women sing during the ceremony. She contends that these songs criticize girls who have sex of their own choice but promote older men\u2019s initiation of sex with girls, without girls\u2019 agreement (p. 139). She also explains that historically Swazi women wanted to wear indlamu (the short skirt) because its high expense showed off the financial status of the family. In contrast, the slightly longer skirt (indiloko) was associated with poverty and was looked down upon because it was seen as covering the girls\u2019 bodies which were supposed to be on display. In the contemporary context, many girls prefer to use lihiya (described in the video by Gabby Dlamini at the beginning of this post, lihiya or emahiya were called umhelwane by Thoko Ginindza). B. Dlamini emphasizes how contemporary girls often feel embarassed to be dressed with so little clothing and to have their bodies be \u201cscrutinized\u201d as a \u201csexual resource for the king\u201d and by tourists and even their male college classmates (pp. 141-142). Dlamini also details the negative impacts of the umhlanga since it is during this time that girls have sex for the first time, use drugs, become pregnant and even contract STIs such as HIV.\n\nDlamini, Betty Sibongile. 2008. \u201cWomen and Theatre for Development in Swaziland.\u201d The University of London.\n\nA contemporary version of the umhlanga (reed dance).\n\nTidvwaba (the plural form of sidvwaba): In Ginindza\u2019s 1971 paper \u201cDress in Swaziland\u201d which she submitted for Hilda\u2019s course, Anthropology 107a in Fall 1971 (Hilda gave it an A-), she focused on Swazi gendered clothing norms, and she spoke of a specific skirt, made of cattle or ox hide, that only married women (or mothers) wore called a sidvwaba, that was so heavy it \u201cbroke the waist\u201d (p. 1); Thoko noted that it was so stiff that it conquered \u201ceven the most stubborn woman\u201d ensuring that she relinquished her freedom and conformed to the demands of married life (p. 2). Thoko\u2019s research clearly influenced Hilda, since this description can be found in Kuper\u2019s 1973 article \u201cCostume and Identity\u201d (p. 352). However, Thoko\u2019s implication (with a strong feminist undertone) in her 1971 paper is muted in Kuper\u2019s re-telling. Kuper wrote: \u201cthe leather skirt is the breaker of the support (insika is the pole that supports a hut, and the meaning is that even the most stubborn woman is overcome by the leather skirt)\u201d (p. 352).\n\nI contacted the African Art curator, Erica P. Jones, at the Fowler Museum on the UCLA campus in July 2016, to inquire if a Swazi ethnographic object collection existed. Indeed, there was a collection, with a visual index of the materials, though the documentation listed Thoko as a man! I set up a time in November 2016 to go to the Fowler to see and photograph the Swazi objects that Teresa Thoko Ginindza had collected and sent to Hilda Kuper in 1976-1977. At that time Thoko\u2019s official title was: Ethnographer at the Swaziland National Center, in Lobamba (the legislative capital of Swaziland).\n\nA map of Swaziland, Lobamba is the legislative capital.\n\nThe development of the relationship between Hilda and Thoko, 1967-1973\n\nThoko knew Hilda from Swaziland and wrote to her in 1967 asking for Hilda\u2019s help to attend UCLA . With Hilda\u2019s support, Thoko earned her M.A. in African Studies in 1972.\n\nThoko was born December 10, 1942 and received her BA in African Languages and Literature in 1968 at UBLS (the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, located in Roma, Lesotho). On November 28, 1967 she wrote to \u201cDoctor Kuper\u201d:\n\n\u201cYou said when we met at Mbabane [the administrative capital] that I must write to you in California. I hope this letter reaches you. I am writing this letter to ask you if you can help me in any way possible. I so wish to get to that university of California to do African studies\u2026I have no other interest except doing African Studies and digging down to Swati Traditional Literature\u201d (Miss) Teresa Thoko Gindinza, November 28, 1967, Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 24, Folder 20, UCLA Special Collections\n\nAugust 25, 1970: Thoko\u2019s graduate application rejected by Linguistics department at UCLA. Hilda wrote: \u201cI cannot tell you how disappointed I am\u2026I will do all I can to get you to Los Angeles.\u201d June 8, 1972: Hilda recommended (along with other committee members: Maquet, Povey) to the \u201cGentlemen\u201d of the African Studies Center that Thoko should receive her MA in African Studies based upon her examination, her papers and classwork. Hilda also stated that all three committee members felt Thoko was \u201cof PhD caliber.\u201d November 7, 1973: Thoko unemployed but conducting research for HK for Kuper\u2019s biography of Sobhuza II. Collecting speeches from Queen Mother, Gwamile, and the King. Interviewing members of the government, like the constitutional commission. Collecting newspaper clippings about special events such as royal weddings.\n\nIn the same folder as the correspondence between them, is Thoko\u2019s statement of purpose for her admission to UCLA for her PhD (March 18, 1974). This reveals Thoko\u2019s interest in the impact of colonization as well as the traditional aristocracy on women\u2019s roles in Swaziland and women\u2019s attitudes in the post-colonial era. Thoko developed the theme of gender in Swazi culture that Hilda would only address in her creative writing.\n\nThoko\u2019s Statement of Purpose, 1974\n\nTG\u2019s original \u201cMy interest in Anthropology is in Ethnology. I intend to undertake a study of the changing role of women in the Swazi society, the Kingdom of Swaziland, a former British Protectorate, achieved its independence in 1968, September 6\u2026I would like to focus attention on the social, ritual, domestic and economic roles of women and the consequences of change on the traditional family structure.\u201d She cited HK here (Uniform of Colour, 1947) to argue that \u201cSwaziland is considered a male dominated society\u201d where \u201cwomen fulfill subsidiary roles\u201d; however, Thoko emphasized that there was a system to \u201cintegrate women into the national society\u201d and at the same time \u201cpreserve national consciousness and unity.\u201d Thoko was interested in examining institutions that were both \u201ctraditional and modern\u201d including the family, political, law-making, religious and voluntary organizations. She also wanted to study the role of Gwamile, the Queen Mother, in ritual, especially the Reed dance [umhlanga], incwala [first-fruits], as well as in Christian gatherings. Thoko argued that \u201cWomen have always been in the forefront in religious activities.\u201d She wanted to investigate the attitudes toward the \u201csuperimposition of Christian marriage upon traditional marriage.\u201d She forcefully contended that \u201cmale domination\u201d determined \u201ceconomic opportunities for women\u2019s advancement\u201d in certain professions (civil service, medical, teaching) and caused a wage gap which led women to pursue entrepreneurial careers. Thoko\u2019s research questions: i. Would the role of women been [sic] different if Swaziland had no colonial history? ii. Is there an identity of interest between the traditional aristocracy and the colonial administration in maintaining women in their subsidiary role? iii. Have attitudes changed to the role of women in the post-colonial era? \u201cThe consequences of this imbalance are to be explored, for in the rural areas the burden of domestic affairs falls on the women\u201d (2). HK\u2019s changes Hilda changed Ethnology to \u201cSocio-cultural Anthropology\u201d HK deleted the mention of herself. She also made this paragraph sound more positive and therefore Swazi society sound less sexist: \u201cThe Swazi have been described as a male-dominated society but an analysis will reveal the extent to which women are integrated into the national political system and the considerable influence that they wield in all activities.\u201d Hilda\u2019s corrections to Thoko\u2019s statement of purpose This sounds more like Hilda\u2019s argument than Thoko\u2019s. Hilda only expressed a more critical view of Swazi society (in terms of the treatment of women) in her creative writing, like the play A Witch in my Heart (1970). This is explained below. HK toned down Thoko\u2019s critique of Swazi society\u2019s economic discrimination against women. \u201cThe study will, if necessary, include an analysis of voluntary organizations in which women are involved, opportunities for women\u2019s advancement in the civil service and various professions and the circumstances favoring the development of women entrepreneurs in modern Swaziland.\u201d Hilda took out the term \u201cmale domination\u201d as well as \u201cdifferential wage structure\u201d thus the paragraph lost the causal relationship that Thoko made between male domination and economic discrimination against women evidenced in the wage gap and lack of employment in specific industries in Swaziland. Hilda crossed out Thoko\u2019s first question, noting \u201cspeculation.\u201d In the revised version, Hilda removed Thoko\u2019s questions. Intriguingly, these are all issues that are explored in Hilda\u2019s creative writing about Swazi women\u2019s position. Hilda put a slash through the section where Thoko critiqued the government\u2019s lack of attention to providing economic opportunities for rural communities which had led to male out-migration, and caused a high ratio of men in the cities and a low ratio in the rural areas. Hilda removed the critique of the Swazi government from Thoko\u2019s argument. Perhaps this could be explained by the fact that Hilda was working on an official biography of Sobhuza II and her tendency to take an elite or royal Swazi point of view. I will expand on this at the end of this presentation.\n\nFrom the Thoko Ginindza Collection\n\nUmhelwane\n\nHilda with the two wives of Prince Makhosini, the first Prime Minister of Swaziland: La Nldangamandla and La Mkhonta, 1974. Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 45, Folder 8. All three women in this photograph are wearing \u201cumhelwane,\u201d a top cloth worn over other items of clothing. (There are several examples of these in the Thoko Ginindza collection.) Hilda is also wearing a ligcebesha necklace, which will be explained below. Beth Rosen-Prinz deciphered the names of the wives of Makhosini from the verso of this photo.\n\nAccording to this contemporary explanation, umhelwane are described as lihiya (singular) and emahiya (plural).\n\nUmhelwane: this is a \u201ctop cloth\u201d which is \u201cworn wrapped around one shoulder\u201d; part of the complete set of \u201ceveryday clothing\u201d which is referred to as \u201cemahiya.\u201d This \u201ctop cloth\u201d is worn by both sexes. They come in different designs and colors, but the main colors are maroon and orange (as seen in these images). The catalogue numbers for these three umhelwane are X76-378 (orange), X76-379 (red), and X76-380 (maroon). The information on these specific umhelwane comes from Thoko\u2019s fieldnotes (p. 6) that accompany the Acquisition Cover Sheet and Record and Receipt of Incoming Objects.\n\nDetails about umhelwane from Thoko\u2019s paper \u201cDress in Swaziland\u201d for Hilda\u2019s course Anthropology 107a in Fall 1971: The umhelwane is an item of clothing worn over the sidziya (p. 5). The sidziya is an apron made of goat skin given to a woman by her in-laws, similar to a \u201cwedding ring\u201d (p. 3). \u201cBig girls not having reached puberty wear one \u2018sidvwashi\u2019 with or without \u2018umhelwane.'\u201d Sidvwashi is tied on the left side while umhelwane is tied on the right side; it has to be knotted in a specific small knot, not a big one (p. 5). For girls after puberty, the umhelwane is tied on the right; it goes under the left armpit and meets just above the right breast. The part on the back right side protrudes more than the front so that it forms a sleeve (p. 6). Sidvwashi: Thoko explains that the \u201ctidvwashi\u201d (the plural form) are the \u201cbottom pieces worn around the waist\u201d (p. 6). She also explains the linguistic history of the term: sidvwashi could have been \u201cderived from the noise caused by the cloth whilst new and starchy, dvwasha dvwasha, hence sidvwashi\u201d (p. 6).\n\n\u201cDress in Swaziland\u201d can be found in Box 24, Folder 20 in the Hilda Kuper Papers in UCLA Special Collections\n\nKuper referred to \u201csidwashi\u201d in her article \u201cCostume and Identity\u201d (1973). When she and her daughter, Jenny, were in Swaziland in October 1966 for the Ncwala (incwala is the first fruits ceremony to honor the king) a dilemma developed as to what they would wear. This was because the King (Ngwenyama) and his supporters were supposed to wear \u201ctraditional\u201d clothing to demonstrate their national and cultural identity (this was common as African countries established independence from colonial rule). It is suggested to Hilda that Jenny wear a \u201csidwashi\u201d (notice the v is missing) which Hilda described as a \u201cbeautiful but very short beaded skirt which loving mothers usually sewed laboriously for their adolescent daughters\u201d (pp. 358-360). However, what Hilda described sounds more to me like \u201cindlamu\u201d (see above). This website displays contemporary images of \u201csidvwashi\u201d (which is a cloth skirt), and umhelwane (called lihiya and emahiya on the website).\n\nA video explaining how to wear the \u201ctraditional\u201d Swazi attire for young women. I include this video again here because it discusses sidvwashi (this specific type of skirt).\n\nUmgcula\n\nUmgcula, \u201cWoman\u2019s shawl with silkscreened [sic] Swaziland flag, worn in commeration [sic] of national independence in 1968\u201d X76-381 (from the description of the Thoko Ginindza Swaziland Object Donation to the UCLA Fowler Museum)\n\nUmgcula: This is a \u201ccloak\u201d, \u201cworn as a shawl by women only.\u201d This design was developed for Swazi independence in 1968 \u201cas a souvenir\u201d; it contains the \u201csame colors as the flag\u201d and the shield at the center is also found on the Swazi flag (p. 7 of Thoko\u2019s Field Notes, stapled to Acquisition Cover Sheet, and Record and Receipt of Incoming Objects ).\n\nThoko calls this an \u201coverall piece\u201d worn over all the other items of women\u2019s attire she describes in her paper: \u201cDress in Swaziland\u201d for Hilda\u2019s Anthropology 107a in Fall 1971, see p. 6. She explains that this piece of clothing covers the whole body, from shoulder to ankle.\n\nBeadwork: Ligcebesha\n\n\u201cLigcebesh [represented in the collection at the Fowler museum] is worn around the neck and has two pieces with the same design at the front. These are woven into a string long enough to go round the neck. Instead of ligcebesha, ingciba may be worn, it is very similar to the ligcebesha, the only difference being that unlike ligcebesha, ingciba does not have the two pieces. Sigcizo is worn around the wrist and the ankles\u201d (Ginindza, \u201cDress in Swaziland\u201d, 1971, p. 8).\n\nHilda Kuper (center) with Leo Kuper (behind) and Max Gluckman (right) at Watts Towers, Los Angeles. Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 45, Folder 20. Gelya Frank thinks that this photograph was likely taken in the early or mid-1970s when Gluckman came to UCLA to give a lecture. Hilda is wearing a Swazi ligcebesha necklace. Examples of these necklaces can be found at the UCLA Fowler Museum, Thoko Ginindza Swazi collection, catalogue numbers: X76-336 to X76-345.\n\nSwazi jewelry collection, emphasizing the ligcebesha necklaces. X76-336, 338, 340, 341, 342, 344, 345, 355. Thoko explains that pink beads are more \u201ctraditional\u201d and more difficult to obtain, whereas purple beads are more easily accessible and are used for tourism products. X76-337 and 338 use the letters \u201cS\u201d and \u201cD\u201d for Swaziland. Ligcebesha are worn by both sexes & children as \u201can everyday accessory.\u201d Other jewelry that is visible here that is not categorized as ligcebesha are: X76-348, a red and white ingciba necklace for women only. Additionally, X76-346 is also an ingciba with pink beads along the top and yellow along the bottom (used by both sexes). Finally, there is a sigcizo beaded bracelet, X76-355, meant to imitate grass bracelets; this type is also worn by both sexes. This info is from Thoko\u2019s Field Notes (pp. 3-4) which accompany the Acquisition Cover Sheet and the Record and Receipt of Incoming Objects as well as the digitalized Description of the Thoko Ginindza Swaziland Object Donation to the UCLA Fowler Museum.\n\nHilda\u2019s Swazi affiliations & Perspectives\n\nCasey Golomski reveals that what Hilda viewed as \u201ctraditional\u201d Swazi customs were likely recent re-introductions that King Sobhuza II initiated in the 1920s and \u201830s (and that Hilda helped to reinstate as \u201ctraditions\u201d through her writings) in order to revive the \u201cmilitaristic regimental age system\u201d called emabutfo, which served to bolster his own royal power and control over national consciousness (Golomski 2011, 8\u20139). Hugh MacMillan (1995) maintains that while Kuper believed in the importance of studying history and social change, she still did not emphasize discontinuities within Swazi so-called \u201ctraditions\u201d because she wanted to support \u201cthe Swazi point of view\u201d which was a royal and elite perspective (Macmillan 1995, 559\u201361). Leroy Vail and Landeg White (1991) contend that Hilda\u2019s writings about Sobhuza served to promote his propaganda campaign to promote Swazi \u201ctradition\u201d in support of his monarchy (Golomski 2011, 9; Vail and White 1991, 179, 192).\n\nGolomski, Casey. 2011. \u201cHilda Kuper, Anthropology, History.\u201d In University of Swaziland, UNISWA, History Staff Seminar Series, 21.

Power and the Praise Poem: Southern African Voices in History. University Press of Virginia.\n\nIn an interview with her student, Gelya Frank (1979), Kuper maintained that Westernization caused the deterioration of women\u2019s position in Swazi society: \u201cThe westernized Swazi man retains the most terrible chauvinist attitude toward women.\u201d Hilda believed that polygamy was part of the Swazi respect for women (18). An example Hilda provided was that Sobhuza II (the King of Swaziland who had authorized her research and publications on the Swazi from 1934-1978) had to sit on the ground when his elder sister entered the dwelling where Hilda sat. Hilda explained that age, rank and sex all played an integral role. Thus, it could not be argued that women were necessarily inferior within Swazi society and instead she used the term \u201ccomplementarity\u201d (Frank and Kuper 1979, 17\u201318).\n\nFrank, Gelya, and Hilda Kuper. 1979. \u201cRough Transcript Interview Conducted by Gelya Frank with Hilda Kuper Re: Ethics/Morality of Life History Work and Hilda\u2019s Biography of Sobhuza II, June 28, 1979.\u201d Los Angeles: Hilda Kuper Papers, Box 16, Folder 5, UCLA Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library.\n\nKuper\u2019s perspectives were highly influenced by her identification with Swazi culture and especially her affiliation with the Swazi royal family. For example, she told Gelya Frank:\n\nAnd I think an anthropologist owes it to the people who take her into confidence\u2026\n\nBut I was also given a very specialized position in the hierarchy and would have to stand with the queens, stand with the princesses. Hilda Kuper, 1979, page 11\n\nHilda\u2019s argument that Swazi women were better treated than Zulu women (who did not have a \u201cQueen Mother\u201d) rested upon an example from the royal family, rather than reference to non-elite Swazi gender relations. Also, her ties of obligation to Sobhuza necessitated her adoption of a Swazi elite male point of view regarding women\u2019s position in Swazi society, at least in her \u201cacademic writings.\u201d\n\nIn the Swazi society that Kuper observed, conformity was of the utmost importance in order to prevent jealousy and rivalry between co-wives: \u201cA conservative (and wise) polygamist bestows on all his wives identical prints and blankets so as not to awaken jealousy; though each woman may impart her own distinctive quality and express herself in small part by the ornaments she herself makes\u201d but to an outsider the prints all looked the same (Kuper 1973, 353).\n\nKuper, Hilda. 1973. \u201cCostume and Identity.\u201d Comparative Studies in Society and History 15 (3): 348\u201367.\n\nA Witch in my heart- Hilda\u2019s Creative Writing\n\nHilda tended to portray women as victims rather than as empowered and creative resistors to hierarchical and patriarchal structures. As Kuper depicted in A Witch in my Heart, Swazi wives, who were considered outsiders in their husband\u2019s patrilocal family, were required to conform to strict rules. If one of the wives (in this story her name is Bigwapi) demonstrated any extraordinary talents including cooking, gardening or creativity, and if a tragedy befell the family (such as the death of a co-wife\u2019s child), they were deemed a witch (and murderer of the child) by male diviners. Fathers-in-law were responsible for hiring these male diviners. If (& when) the non-conforming co-wife (in this story Bigwapi) was found guilty of witchcraft she was banished to her natal home, where she continued to be dreaded and feared. Even if the woman\u2019s husband did not want her banished, he was forced to obey his father, who was the ultimate head of power; the father-in-law maintained the stability of the male controlled family and protected co-wives from what were considered non-conforming and aberrant wives (Kuper and Institute 1970, xiv\u2013xxvi).\n\nKuper, Hilda, and International African Institute. 1970. A Witch in My Heart: A Play Set in Swaziland in the 1930s. Oxford U.P.\n\nThe Swazi mother- in-law character in Kuper\u2019s play A Witch in My Heart, seemed to blame the Swazi patriarchy for Bigwapi\u2019s exile when she stated \u201cthe law of our people is hard on women\u201d (Kuper and Institute 1970:56). Bigwapi\u2019s banishment can also be partly explained by the colonial system that not only forced Swazi men to journey to cities for access to money, but also imprisoned them unjustly for drinking beer in privately-run bars.\n\nUniform of Colour\n\nHowever, in her academic writing, the European colonial authorities were clearly identified as the cause of social injustice for Swazi people, especially Swazi men. In Uniform of Colour (1947), Kuper revealed that Swazi men felt feminized by the European legal system, remarking that they had become the \u201cwomen of the Europeans\u201d (Kuper 1947, 152). Swazi men also perceived the European colonial system as protecting women and witches (1947, 70-71) and Swazi male leaders no longer sentenced accused witches to death because of fear of the white man\u2019s punishments (1970, 53-55).\n\nKuper, Hilda. 1947. The Uniform of Colour; a Study of White-Black Relationships in Swaziland. New York: Negro Universities Press.\n\nKuper explicated that, \u201cA Swazi woman, like most women, values her family life more than economic independence or equality before the law,\u201d and that Swazi women preferred being beaten to being celibate or lonely; even though Swazi women might have seemed \u201cfrustrated,\u201d they were \u201ccomplete\u201d within their society, she argued (1947, 152). However, in apparent contrast to her own argument, she also wrote that Swazi women sought out the European courts when they were accused of witchcraft and in domestic disputes with their husbands (Kuper 1947, 70\u201371; Kuper and Institute 1970, 35).\n\nThe female characters in Hilda\u2019s fiction emerge as the victims of not only the colonial authorities but also indigenous societies. These underlying messages oftentimes stand in direct contrast with Kuper\u2019s explicit arguments in her academic writings that direct the blame to the European colonial systems. As Kerry Vincent illustrates: Kuper was part of a \u201cliterature of protest\u201d written by other South African \u201cwhite liberals,\u201d to contest \u201ccolonial fantasies\u201d but also to \u201calert Swazis to the violence of some of their own traditional practices\u201d (Vincent 2011, 96).\n\nVincent, Kerry. 2011. \u201cLiterature as Laboratory: Hilda Kuper\u2019s Factional Representations of Swaziland.\u201d African Studies 70 (1): 89\u2013102.\n\nThoko\u2019s writings about women\n\nThoko cited Hilda\u2019s An African Aristocracy (1947) frequently in her 1989 report Swazi Women: Sociocultural and Economic Considerations in Chapter 3 about the \u201cTraditional Role of Swazi Women.\u201d For example, \u201cThe importance of the mother and her control in all matters affecting the homestead is an outstanding feature of Swazi family and national life\u201d (Kuper, 1947, pp. 38-39; Ginindza, 1989, p. 15).\n\n\u201cSwazi men succeed to positions of power, authority, and wealth by virtue of the position of their mothers\u201d Thoko Ginindza, 1989, p. 15\n\n\u201c\u2026married women are perceived always as outsiders and as potential sources of conflict that threaten the unity of the man\u2019s group; often, cases of social conflict are [grounds for suspicion of witchcraft]\u201d Ginindza, 1989, p. 16\n\nThis directly relates to Hilda\u2019s play A Witch in my Heart. In addition, Gindinza cites Kuper in regards to the inferiority of women\u2019s work in comparison to men\u2019s. Hilda wrote that it was the sex of the work that gave the work its value (Ginindza, 1989, p. 17; Kuper, 1947, p. 140).\n\nIn Chapter VI, \u201cSummary Findings on the Position of Swazi Women- Constraints to Women\u2019s Full Participation in Non-Farm Economic Activities,\u201d Ginindza cited Kuper in order to emphasize how \u201cSwazis need strong incentives of prestige or utility to accept innovations that will affect deeply-entrenched attitudes and behaviour.\u201d Kuper argued that because leadership was based on pedigree, leaders needed incentive (an enhancement of prestige) in order to make changes. Thoko used this to explain the \u201cconstraints\u201d on \u201cwomen\u2019s full participation in economic activities\u201d (Ginindza, 1989, p. 52; Kuper 1947, p. 139).\n\nThoko\u2019s earlier interest in women\u2019s organizations (expressed in her Statement of Purpose to UCLA) is clear in her report (1989):\n\nWomen show a potential to organize themselves. There are numerous women\u2019s organizations and associations-formal and informal, secular and religious, registered and unregistered-in urban, periurban, and rural areas. These organizations should be tapped for development purposes. Generally, the women have identified their needs and decided on their goals. Very little information on women\u2019s organizations exists, and a study on this subject is vital if women are to be fully integrated in the socioeconomic development of the country.\n\n\n\nSwazi Women: Sociocultural and Economic Considerations, p. 7\n\nA network visualization developed using nodegoat, a database and network visualization software created by Lab1100. This visualization demonstrates the publication intersections between Hilda Kuper and Thoko Ginindza, including the thematic overlap between their work. Note that Umnyakaza was assigned or \u201cgiven\u201d to Hilda by Sobhuza II, as her \u201cumfana\u201d or \u201cboy\u201d who was supposed to serve her as he would a member of the royal family. In An African Aristocracy (1947/1961) she wrote of Umnyakaza: \u201cThe umfana becomes a member of the over-lord\u2019s intimate circle of dependents, regards him as a father and is treated much like a son. Umnyakaza, a warrior from Sobhuza\u2019s own bodyguard, acted as my teacher, interpreter, cook, and travelling companion\u201d (2). This demonstrates how affiliated Hilda was with the royal family and her elite position within the Swazi community.\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-95531-5_1", "page_content": "As I noted above, the content of this edited volume is based on the positionality challenges and access frustrations that each contributor faced in some way while out in the field. One such frustration that has received only scant attention in the scholarly literature to date is the complex web of emotions and challenges facing researchers who return home to conduct research. In Chapter 2 of this volume, Nungari Mwangi illuminates some of these issues with an exploration of the positionality challenges that she faced when she returned to Kenya to carry out fieldwork for her doctoral research. While we might expect a researcher who returns home to conduct research to have an easier ride in terms of identity and access, Mwangi argues that positionality for African researchers reorienting themselves toward home means a deeper critical engagement with a variety of selves. For Mwangi, her identity as female, Kenyan, and a Cambridge University student all added layers of complexity to the way she positioned herself and the ways in which her research participants positioned her also. Bringing to life encounters which saw her at times emphasizing some aspects of her Kenyan identity while downplaying others, and at other times slipping in between identities, Mwangi disrupts well-worn dichotomies that position researchers as either inside or outside of the community being researched. In sharing her approach to questions about identity and reciprocity, she provides an avenue for researchers to consider the ways in which positionality differs for scholars researching back home while adding a female African voice to debates around ideas of strangeness and belonging.\n\nStrangeness and belonging are well-known concepts for researchers heading to the field. Feelings of strangeness in particular often accompany the beginning stages of research which can destabilize the researcher (Agar 2006; Jackson 2010; Rancatore 2010). The author of Chapter 7 in this volume, Langton Miriyoga understands destabilization well. Like Mwangi, Miriyoga returned home to conduct research, but with one significant difference. Rather than returning to his native home of Zimbabwe, Miriyoga conducted research in his adopted home of South Africa. Adding further layers of complexity to the process of data collection and interpretation, Miriyoga\u2019s research focus was the plight of Zimbabwean migrants, like himself, living in the townships of Cape Town and Johannesburg. Far from the ease of access he anticipated in the planning stages of his research, Miriyoga describes how shared identity does not always open doors to people and knowledge when the target research population is vulnerable and rumors about spies from back home abound. In examining his strategies for gaining access to vulnerable migrants, Miriyoga conveys a valuable lesson to researchers returning home: no matter how hard we try it is difficult to close off our own bias and memories of places and people. The mere observation of this fact, however, does not prevent us from successfully conducting research back home ; as both Miriyoga and Mwangi show in this volume, it simply means that we have to problematize the idea of home which, following Mandiyanke (2009), carries a lot more baggage when we return as researchers with intimate knowledge of the field-site and its people.\n\nThe chapters from Mwangi and Miriyoga detail specific strategies that researchers can employ to come to terms with the positionality challenges of conducting research \u2018back home .\u2019 Both chapters consider it critical that researchers think about how prior relationships, and the ways in which fellow country men and women perceive us, can affect both the ways in which we collect and interpret data. In Chapter 3 of this volume, Christine van Hooft discusses a similar issue in her exploration of the ways in which prior relationships with one\u2019s research subjects can both help and hinder data collection. Early research in sociology and anthropology posited the dichotomous doctrine of the insider and the outsider , with each position bringing both benefits as well as challenges (Pike 1967; Merton 1972). More recent research has looked beyond this dichotomization, recognizing that research relationships are much more multidimensional and specific to research projects with relationships mediating research positions of status or difference (Bourdieu 1977; Merriam et al. 2001; Serrant-Green 2002; Cargo and Mercer 2008; Dwyer and Buckle 2009). Banks (1998) points to the spaces in between creating a more complex range of positionalities that are based on differences in researcher socialization within specific ethnic, racial, and cultural communities. In Chapter 3, van Hooft explores these spaces in between with an analysis of the ways in which her previous role as a civil servant with the Ugandan Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development added an extra layer of complexity to data production. Drawing on what she refers to as a third category of researcher\u2014the hybrid insider\u2013outsider who shares some characteristics of the studied group, but nonetheless is an outsider in regard to other important characteristics\u2014van Hooft looks particularly at the unique challenges her hybrid insider\u2013outsider status posed in terms of the care needed in collecting, interpreting, and presenting data. She joins Mwangi and Miriyoga in showing how having prior relationships or identification with research participants can both impede as well as facilitate data production .\n\nThroughout the research process, our role, position, and identity change. Additionally, people\u2019s image of a researcher\u2019s identity and agenda may shift over time. Maddy Gupta-Wright\u2019s contribution in Chapter 4 is specifically dedicated to this theme. Like van Hooft\u2019s chapter on hybrid identity and positionality, Gupta-Wright\u2019s chapter in this volume is concerned with the multidimensional aspects of research relationships, but with an important distinction: Gupta-Wright is a former medical doctor by training, making her role, position, and identity as an anthropologist conducting research on disease particularly problematic at times. Reflecting on her experience conducting fieldwork in Malawi, Gupta-Wright discusses the ways in which she navigated ethical and moral quandaries that emerged as she attempted to leave her identity as a medical doctor behind. She discusses the ways in which she struggled with the different positions, that she both assumed and were thrust upon her, showing how multi-positionalities are constructed from assumptions and impressions, both of and by researchers and research participants, and how these slowly change over time.\n\nAssumptions and impressions accompany all fieldwork encounters. When we enter the field, we enter as members of groups about which our research participants already have preconceived notions about who we are. Since the 1990s, feminists have positioned the analytical lens on gendered positionality and the effects that perceived gender roles, and the power relations that often accompany gender issues, have on all stages of the research process from the design of the research proposal to the collection and analysis of data (McDowell 1992; England 1994; Rose 1997). Feminist research has recognized that researchers and their research participants have a \u2018different and unequal relation to knowledge\u2019 (Glucksmann 1994, p. 150) and that within most research projects, \u2018the final shift of power between the researcher and the respondent is balanced in favor of the researcher\u2019 (Cotterill 1992, p. 604). Acknowledging that power relations are a given in research relationships, more recent feminist scholarship has now moved toward an analysis of how, rather than whether, gender and power influence knowledge production and construction processes. But when Lyn Johnstone, in Chapter 5 of this volume, searched the literature for examples of how to deal with an issue that problematized understandings of gender and power\u2014that of flirtation directed by the research participant toward the researcher\u2014she found very little acknowledgment of the existence of what she calls \u2018sexualized identity\u2019 in research, outside of accounts of sexual harassment in the field. Through a discussion of the ways in which she encountered and reciprocated flirtatious banter directed by male interviewees during fieldwork in Rwanda and Zimbabwe, Johnstone adds nuance to the discussion on gender and power relations exploring the role that agency, power, and performance play when flirtation enters a research encounter and addressing the effect that flirtatious banter has both on the production and interpretation of data. In particular, she discusses performance and the ways in which flirtation and the performance of perceived gender roles can both impede and facilitate data production.\n\nLike Johnstone, Carolin Stamm\u2019s contribution in Chapter 8 also explores a specific way in which access to knowledge and data is negotiated as she uses her fieldwork with CBOs and NGOs in rural conservation projects in Namibia to reconceptualize gatekeeper-researcher relationships. Stamm argues that research that heavily relies on fieldwork is profoundly influenced by the opportunities and constraints encountered during data collection, which often lie in the hands of gatekeepers . Taking a different approach to the usual focus in the literature on the role of the gatekeeper as a static instrumental figure to navigate around, Stamm critically evaluates the role that gatekeepers play in the data collection process, analysis and formation of research findings. She finds that the manner in which access to knowledge is negotiated should not be divorced from the results generated.\n\nIn the sixth chapter of this volume, Kerstin Tomiak takes this important insight one step further with a focus on how our emotional responses affect the ways in which we interpret data. Tomiak opens up discussion of identity within the discourse around positionality and writes of the need to add a further category to the list of gender, ethnicity, race , class, culture and so on\u2014that of emotions. Tomiak\u2019s suggestion connects to Madge\u2019s argument that many researchers writing on their experiences in the field have pointed out that it is crucial to consider \u2018the role of the (multiple) \u201cself\u201d, showing how a researcher\u2019s positionality (in terms of race , nationality, age, gender, social and economic status, and sexuality) may influence the \u201cdata\u201d collected and thus the information that becomes coded as \u201cknowledge\u201d\u2019 (Madge 1993, p. 296). Tomiak adds a layer of nuance to this discussion in examining the links between the personal emotions of researchers, which, as Meyer (2007) notes, often receive little attention in the set-up of a research project, and method choices going forward. Grappling with her reactions to the deeply emotional responses of South Sudanese refugees, Tomiak offers insight into the ways in which emotions affect our present and future positionalities during fieldwork. She concludes that the experiences made in the field, and the emotions that these experiences trigger, play an important and often overlooked part in a researcher\u2019s positionality and in turn are carried with us into the planning stages of future research projects. Tomiak\u2019s contribution provides an avenue for researchers to consider how or whether our emotional experiences on one project might come to affect our methodological choices at a later date.\n\nThe observation of the way in which emotional responses affect future method choices opens up the discussion to other factors which might influence or affect the collection of data. While all of the chapters in this volume reflect on the ways in which positionality affects the collection and production of data, two chapters stand out for their discussion of failure in this respect. Firstly, Elizaveta Volkova in Chapter 9 of this volume on coping with the possibility of failed fieldwork in Senegal reflects upon the issues that can accompany research which is heavily reliant on gatekeepers who act as the bridge between researcher and research participants. Taking a different view of gatekeepers to that taken by Stamm in Chapter 8, Volkova tells the story of the challenges she faced while attempting to access information about the joking relationships between members of the Joola community in Emanpore in the Casamance region of Senegal. Connecting both the access challenge and the positionality focus of the book, she discusses different attributes that might impact the researcher\u2019s ability to successfully collect data. In her case, a push by the tourist board in the Casamance region to boost the tourism-fueled economy led to gatekeeper distortion of the questions Volkova was attempting to ask and the answers she was seeking, which led her to believe that her research was failing. Volkova\u2019s experience connects to Nilan\u2019s (2002, p. 368) observation that \u2018the researcher as human subject is [\u2026] in flux, dealing with shifting realities and contradictions.\u2019 Her discussion provides an important lesson that managing our own fear of failure is a common feature of research. Volkova\u2019s chapter also alerts us to the fact that there is very little scholarly literature on the theme of failed research and what a researcher might do to overcome the emotional and practical challenges of the threat of failure . Observations such as Volkova\u2019s shine a light on the fact that the more challenging aspects of access are very rarely discussed and fly in the face of observations by some researchers that \u2018anyone can go to the field, observe, conduct interviews, and gather evidence\u2019 (Thomson et al. 2013, p. 6).\n\nJosh Pritchard\u2019s chapter also speaks to the theme of failure and how access challenges and positionality often go hand in hand. Pritchard, in Chapter 10 of this volume, addresses the question of how we might adapt our methodologies in order to be flexible to the challenges of gaining access to data in authoritarian regimes. Pritchard writes on his lengthy negotiations with the Zimbabwean authorities to secure a research permit in order to conduct historical research in the National Archives of Zimbabwe. He offers essential advice in his chapter: applying for a research permit to conduct research can be a very lengthy process and we should be prepared with a contingency plan in case our application is unsuccessful. Despite lengthy negotiations and the assistance of Zimbabwean academics, Pritchard never was successful in gaining an official permit, ultimately because of the fact that he was from Britain\u2014a country hostile to Zimbabwe. In this respect, Pritchard\u2019s discussion teaches an important lesson: positionality and access are two concepts that are entirely connected to one another whether we realize it or not."}, {"url": "https://snaccooperative.org/view/69001278", "page_content": "Hilda Kuper was born in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), 1911; married Leo Kuper (1935); BA (1935) and MA (1934), Univ. of Witwatersrand; Ph.

She grew up in Johannesburg and went to Witwatersrand University for her undergraduate studies. She received there the B.A. degree in anthropology. In 1932, she came to London, where she studied under the charismatic teacher Bronislaw Malinowski at the London School of Economics, where she obtained the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in social anthropology.\n\nIn 1934, she was awarded a grant by the International African Institute of London to study the Swazi. So began her lifelong association with Swaziland and its royal family. Her first books were on the Swazi, An African Aristocracy and The Uniform of Colour, both published in 1947. Her last was a revised edition of The Swazi: A South African Kingdom; published in 1986, it brings the Swazi history up to 1983.\n\nFor almost six decades, she was committed to the study, defense, and illustration of the Swazi traditions as embodied in the social and political vision of King Sobhuza II, a friend from the thirties to the eighties--he died in 1982. In 1970, three years after Swaziland became an independent state, Sobhuza granted her Swazi citizenship. Later he appointed her his official biographer. She wrote the authoritative history of his reign--in fact the history of Swaziland in the twentieth century, as Sobhuza was born in 1899. The book, Sobhuza II, Ngwenyama and King of Swaziland, was published in 1978.\n\nIn 1936, Hilda married Leo Kuper, a South African lawyer who later trained for a Ph.D. in sociology (eventually he became head of the sociology department at the University of Natal and then professor of sociology at UCLA). With him, Hilda was active in political movements;\n\n\u2015 155 \u2015\n\nthe Kupers were among the founding members of the Liberal Party. Convinced that social reform could be achieved through knowledge, she studied the Indian community of Durban (, 1960). During that period she also published two detailed ethnographies,, 1952, and, 1955, faithfully conforming to the famous outline of the Ethnographic Survey of Africa.\n\nHilda Kuper's main career was academic. While in South Africa, she taught at the Universities of Witwatersrand and Natal, and held visiting positions at the Universities of Birmingham and North Carolina. In 1961, harassment of opposition intellectuals having increased in South Africa, the Kupers left the country and settled in the United States.\n\nIn 1963, Hilda Kuper joined the Department of Anthropology at UCLA, where she was an influential and inspirational teacher. Until her retirement in 1977, she offered a variety of courses and seminars on the traditional societies of Africa, and on specialized topics such as British social anthropology, biography in anthropology, and fiction as a means of understanding the thought and affectivity of another culture. Her two works of fiction, a novel, The Bite of Hunger, 1965, and a play, A Witch in my Heart, 1970, are brilliant examples of intuitive communication of deep meanings that complement the knowledge of another culture gained by discursive scholarship. Because of her clear, warm, and convincing teaching style, she was recalled in 1989 to create a new course, Destruction and Survival of Indigenous Societies.\n\nHilda Kuper was awarded the Rivers Memorial Medal for field work by the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1961 and an honorary doctorate of letters by the University of Swaziland in 1990.\n\nHilda Kuper's contributions to anthropology are considerable in substance and interpretation. In substance, she has enriched the body of ethnographic knowledge--still the foundation of anthropology--by her thorough and meticulous descriptions of the Swazi and Shona cultures. In interpretation, she has demonstrated that strict reasoning and sharp argumentation do not preclude insight and empathy, that a generous and fearless advocacy is compatible with an honest and complete presentation of all the facts, and that an appreciation of ancient traditions does not divert from urgent contemporary issues.\n\nHilda Kuper was survived by her husband, Leo, who died in 1994, and two daughters, Jenny and Marry, and three grandchildren.\n\nWolf Leslau Jacques Maquet Charles Nixon"}, {"url": "https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-9276-10-3", "page_content": "Sizeable health inequalities by race [1, 2], gender [3, 4] and class [5] have been recorded in Canada. Consistent with traditional sociological understandings of social inequality, these axes of inequality have for the most part been considered individually, with researchers only considering potential interconnectedness when investigating whether class mediates associations between race and health or gender and health. Whether class influences health differently for visible minority Canadians and White Canadians or race influences health differently for men and women, for example, has not yet been investigated. When statistical interactions such as these have received analytical attention - for example, whether class influences health differently for Canadian men and women [3] - they have not been adequately theorized. Intersectionality theory, an influential theoretical tradition inspired by the feminist and antiracist traditions, demands that inequalities by race, gender, and class (and sexuality as well) be considered in tandem rather than distinctly. This is because these fundamental axes of inequality in contemporary societies are considered to be intrinsically entwined; they mutually constitute and reinforce one another and as such cannot be disentangled from one another. Intersectionality theory presents a new way of understanding social inequalities that possesses potential to uncover and explicate previously unknown health inequalities. This paper describes the results of an original empirical investigation of the degree to which the self-rated health of Canadians varies by race, gender, class, and/or sexual orientation in ways that are consistent with predictions of intersectionality theory. The remainder of this background section describes some of the central principles of this theoretical tradition followed by a description of the analytical strategy used to apply these principles in an empirical investigation of inequalities in self-rated health in Canada.\n\nIntersectionality theory\n\nIn the forward to a recent book on new theories and methods for studying race, class, and gender, Lynn Weber [6] describes how American women of color in the 1970s and early 1980s, many from working class backgrounds, came to critique the patriarchy tradition within gender studies for privileging gender over race and class (and subsequently critiqued the stratification tradition for privileging class over gender and race, etc.). They argued that these axes of inequality are in fact analytically inseparable, and that \"the multidimensionality and interconnected nature of race, class, and gender hierarchies were especially visible to those who faced oppression along more than one dimension of inequality\" [6:xii]. These scholars envisioned axes of inequality pertaining to gender, race, and class that intersect with one another, i.e., that are interlocked, dependent upon one another, and mutually constituted [7]. Power relationships along the lines of gender, race, and class were thought to be mutually defining and mutually reinforcing rather than analytically distinct systems of oppression, together forming a \"matrix of domination\" [8]. By the mid-1980s, lesbians of color had bridged the gap between gay and lesbian studies and the growing body of race, gender, and class research that had to that point ignored heterosexism [6], and axes of inequality pertaining to national origin, citizenship status, religion, disability, and age also received some attention. The contributions of these various scholars gave rise to what is now known as \"intersectionality theory.\" Landry [9] notes, however, that intersectionality theory does not provide a set of propositions that together form an explanation; rather, intersectionality theory currently consists of a loose set of principles or assumptions that are being applied and tested by many researchers in a variety of contexts.\n\nFounded upon analyses of relations of power in general and inspired by theories of racism, patriarchy, classism, and heterosexism in particular, in American intersectionality discourse the disadvantaged groups along the inequality axes of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation are assumed to be visible minorities from various backgrounds (especially African Americans), women, members of the lower and working classes, and gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. These comprise implicit intersectionality assumptions of \"directionality.\"\n\nIntersectionality theorists argue that our identities based on race, gender, class, and sexuality accompany us in every social interaction [7]. The principle of \"simultaneity\" maintains that all of the axes and their corresponding identities should be incorporated into social analyses.\n\n\"Race, class and gender may all structure a situation but may not be equally visible and/or important in people's self-definitions... This recognition that one category may have salience over another for a given time and place does not minimize the theoretical importance of assuming that race, class and gender as categories of analysis structure all relationships\" [7:560-1].\n\nThat is, while some axes and identities may be more pertinent to a specific social context or outcome than are others, simultaneity implies that a social researcher should never discard an axis of inequality before investigating its potential relevance for the problem at hand.\n\nIntersections between axes are thought to create complex social locations that are more central to the nature of social experiences than are any of the axes of inequality considered singly.\n\n\"People experience race, class, gender and sexuality differently depending upon their social location in the structures of race, class, gender and sexuality. For example, people of the same race will experience race differently depending upon their location in the class structure as working class, professional managerial class or unemployed; in the gender structure as female or male; and in structures of sexuality as heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual\" [10:326-7].\n\nThus \"multiplicativity\" should supplant additivity [10]. Racism x sexism x classism x sexism should replace racism + sexism + classism + sexism [11, 12]. A lower-class Black lesbian is necessarily all of these things, and their mutual manifestation represents a unique state of being and a unique set of social experiences and structural constraints.\n\n\"Race, class, gender and sexuality are not reducible to individual attributes to be measured and assessed for their separate contribution in explaining social outcomes, an approach that Elizabeth Spelman calls \"pop-bead metaphysics,\" where a woman's identity consists of the sum of parts neatly divisible from one another. The matrix of domination seeks to account for the multiple ways that women experience themselves as gendered, raced, classed and sexualized\" [10:327].\n\nExperiences of gender are racialized, sexualized, and classed; experiences of class are gendered, racialized, and sexualized, etc.\n\nFrom the abovementioned principles of directionality, simultaneity, and multiplicativity arise new versions of double jeopardy and triple jeopardy, renamed \"multiple jeopardy\" by Deborah King [11], wherein disadvantaged identities experienced in tandem are seen to result in inordinate, i.e., even more than additive, amounts of disadvantage. Thus complex social locations comprised of disadvantaged identities held in tandem are thought to lead to multiplicative disadvantage; that is, combinations of these identities are thought to have an aggravating rather than a simply cumulative or mitigating effect. In addition, because of the relational nature of intersectional theories, some complex locations, such as the one inhabited by wealthy heterosexual White men, in turn experience multiplicative advantage.\n\nDespite the immense popularity of intersectionality theory in humanities and social sciences circles and the large and growing body of intersectionality research that includes applications of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, very little quantitative research has explicitly applied intersectionality theory to health outcomes. However, many health determinants researchers have unintentionally addressed simultaneity and multiplicativity by identifying two-way statistical interactions between axes of inequality in regression modeling. In Canada, Zheng Wu and colleagues [2] identified interactions between race and socioeconomic status for depression. In the United States, Ostrove and colleagues [13] identified interactions between socioeconomic status and race as predictors of self-rated health and depression, Nomagushi [14] found interactions between race and gender on the effect of marital dissolution on depression, and Read and Gorman [15] determined that the gender gap in health differs widely by racial/ethnic group. But only a few quantitative studies have explicitly studied illness states associated with complex social positions arising from intersections between three axes of inequality [16\u201319], none of them Canadian, and no studies have studied intersections between all four of the primary axes of inequality of intersectionality theory. Given the seeming complicity of all of race [2, 20\u201323], gender [3, 4, 24], class [5, 25\u201329], and sexual orientation [30\u201333] in North American health inequalities, this lack of attention to health inequalities that accrue to multiple combinations of inequality identities represents an important gap in the health determinants literature.\n\nAnalytical strategy\n\nModeling the main effects of inequality identities (additivity) and then statistical interactions between them (multiplicativity) in multivariate regression models on health can establish whether two-way or three-way statistical interactions (intersections) between axes of inequality contribute to explaining variability in health above and beyond the additive approach to health inequalities that currently dominates health determinants research. This paper uses a two-stage analytical strategy, the first additive and the second multiplicative, applied to a large representative survey dataset from Canada in order to investigate health outcomes associated with intersections between race, gender, class, and sexual orientation.\n\nFirst, the strength and direction of the main effects in additive regression models such as Race + Gender + Class + Sexual Orientation = Health addresses the principles of simultaneity and directionality. Simultaneity suggests that all four identities will make significant contributions to these models before and/or after controlling for one another while directionality implies that non-Whites, women, lower-class people, and non-heterosexuals will manifest the poorer health outcomes.\n\nSecond, simultaneity and multiplicativity imply that the inequality identities should interact meaningfully with one another as predictors of health, that is, statistical interactions between the inequality variables of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation should manifest significant effects above and beyond their main effects in the abovementioned additive models. The existence of interactions speaks to multiplicativity. The qualities of the interactions themselves speak to multiple jeopardy and directionality. At least three multiplicative scenarios are possible for a given statistical interaction: 1. two or more axes of inequality manifest directions of some kind or other in additive models and then display an aggravating effect in the interaction between them, 2. two or more axes manifest given directions in additive models and then display a mitigating effect in their interaction, and 3. an interaction manifests itself between two or more axes but not all of the axes display independent effects in additive models. Aggravating effects support the assumption of multiple jeopardy and reinforce the directionality identified in the additive models whereas non-aggravating effects run contrary to the assumption of multiple jeopardy and complicate directionality. Finally, contributions to predicted variability in the models address multiplicativity by providing an indication of the \"value added\" of the statistical interactions; comparisons of R2 values between regression models with and without the cross-product terms can be used to assess the magnitude of their contributions to explaining variability in health above and beyond the contributions of the main effects."}, {"url": "https://africasacountry.com/2023/04/reading-list-joel-marie-cabrita", "page_content": "My new biography of Regina Gelana Twala tells the story of a woman written out of history. Twala (1908-1968) was a remarkable woman\u2014a political activist in South Africa and Eswatini, she co-founded Eswatini\u2019s first political party and represented the country at pan-African gatherings in Nkrumah\u2019s Ghana. She was also a literary giant, writing as many as five manuscripts (all unpublished, and all but one lost to us). Twala additionally wrote hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. However, despite her achievements, Twala is today forgotten by everyone outside her immediate family.\n\nIn Written Out: The Silencing of Regina Gelana Twala, I answer the question as to why such a talented woman has been forgotten by history. The answer is multi-faceted, invoking prejudices of both race and gender. Politicians, editors, and academics all conspired to block Twala from publishing her work and ensured that her legacy was erased after her death in 1968.\n\nGiven that my biography of Twala deals with a formidable intellectual who has consistently been denied recognition, I would like to think not about my own reading list, but rather about the books that shaped Regina Twala\u2019s life and career. Not all of these books were positive influences. Formative books and reading experiences could constrain, silence, and side-line as well as they could emancipate and inspire. In a 1938 letter to her second husband, Dan Twala, Twala made passing reference to \u201cthat library of mine.\u201d What might some of the books in \u201cthat library\u201d have been?\n\nThe Bible: The Bible would undoubtedly have to be my top pick for Twala. She was born, raised, and educated in the Methodist mission station of Indaleni, near Richmond in then Natal, and she attended the Congregationalist Adams College. She would probably have read the American missionary 1883 isiZulu translation of the Bible (a revised version would only be published in the 1950s). Daily Bible reading shaped Twala\u2019s 60 years of life. As was the case for many educated South Africans of her generation, Twala thought biblically; her language, idioms, and vocabulary were all inflected with the rhythms and resonances of the Judeo-Christian canon. We can\u2019t understand Twala without appreciating the significance of her daily soaks in scriptural texts, and the way in which this book shaped her politics, her creativity, and even her love life.\n\nBantu World: Writers like Twala were often denied opportunities to publish books. Instead, their publishing outlet was in supposedly ephemeral platforms, such as newspapers. In fact, one of Twala\u2019s most formative reading experiences was her immersion in weekly newspapers\u2014more affordable to purchase than books. They contained new literature as serialized novels and short stories, and they offered political commentary and news. During the decades Twala lived in Natal and Johannesburg, her favorite newspaper was the popular Bantu World. Twala weekly pored over its scintillating columns, read its Women\u2019s Pages, absorbed its news items, and stayed abreast of gossip with its Who\u2019s Who section. She regularly clipped out articles she found particularly interesting. By the mid-1930s, Twala had turned from reader to writer, penning a column under the pseudonym of \u201cMademoiselle\u201d that would make her one of the newspaper\u2019s most popular correspondents.\n\nNatal Code of Native Law: This slim volume (republished in 1932 by the government printer) was unfortunately one that Twala was intimately familiar with. The Natal Code set out the legislation that governed Black Africans\u2019 lives in the province. It established a parallel system of legislation to European law, trapping Africans in \u201ctraditional\u201d norms and providing the legal structure that justified their subordination. Twala\u2019s early life in South Africa was an exercise in negotiating its strictures. As a young woman she applied for \u201cemancipation\u201d from the Code on the grounds of her education (invoking its Section 28). While seeking her separation from her first husband, Percy Khumalo, she was governed by its draconian dictates regarding African marriage and divorce. In an argument with her lover, Dan Twala, she scathingly accused him of not grasping the legal intricacies of her unhappy predicament: \u201cYou make me sick. I am not going to send you the Natal Code because you don\u2019t understand the technic [sic] of the law. You are a cow so far as that is concerned.\u201d\n\nPorgy: Twala first read the white Southerners Dorothy and DuBose Heyward\u2019s play Porgy in the late 1930s (and the play was itself an adaption of DuBose Heyward\u2019s 1925 novel of the same name and would later become the material for George Gershwin\u2019s famous opera, Porgy and Bess). Twala was one of many South Africans who read and admired the play in this decade. While Black Americans criticized the play\u2019s reiteration of tropes of Black criminality, the reception was far warmer amongst South African readers who found its portrayal of urban vice and downfall resonated with many of their own concerns about cities like Johannesburg. Twala wholeheartedly empathized with its tale of doomed love, finding Bess and Porgy\u2019s predicament a sad mirror of her own affair with Dan Twala. Throughout 1938 and 1939, Twala worked on extracting and adapting the play for performance by Dan\u2019s Bantu Dramatic Society in Johannesburg.\n\nAn African Aristocracy: The South African anthropologist Hilda Kuper wrote An African Aristocracy: Rank Among the Swazi in 1947. The book quickly cemented Kuper\u2019s reputation as the foremost ethnographer of the emaSwati people. Yet Twala\u2019s changing relationship with African Aristocracy provides a microcosm of her own evolution as a scholar of Swati culture. Initially, Twala was deferential to the book\u2019s expertise, respectfully citing Kuper in her own written work. Yet by the 1960s, Twala had no patience with white scholars who claimed expertise on African societies In 1964, she publicly dismissed Kuper\u2019s book as \u201cdated,\u201dsurely a swipe at the fact that Kuper had at this point not visited Eswatini in 20 years. Kuper, however, would get her revenge on her old student. After Twala\u2019s death in 1968, Kuper refused a plea to help publish Twala\u2019s final manuscript. Instead, Kuper buried the work in her UCLA study. I came across this manuscript a few years ago while going through Kuper\u2019s personal papers in the UCLA archive. I would twin these two books\u2014African Aristocracy with Twala\u2019s final unpublished book\u2014as an indictment of the difficulties Black female scholars like Twala faced in comparison to the acclaim that far more easily greeted their white counterparts. Even more pointedly, the reputation of a book like African Aristocracy was achieved by Hilda Kuper squashing the careers of rival scholars like Twala."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-leo-kuper-1438982.html", "page_content": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

His studies were full of subtle and sophisticated argument, based on careful empirical research and written with elegance, but it was a moral commitment that drove him on.\n\nKuper contemplated the bleak South Africa of his day without illusions, but without despair. Some of his major works were banned by the Nationalist government, and he was later venomously attacked by advocates of political violence, but he never wavered in his commitment to the liberal principles that co-operation was better than polarisation, that argument and if necessary passive resistance were to be preferred to revolutionary violence, and that civil institutions, that brought people of different groups together in co-operative enterprises, provided the most effective counter to racial division. He was one of the few to argue in the darkest days of apartheid that a social basis existed in South Africa for a peaceful transition to a democratic society, a consummation that was achieved in the last month of his life.\n\nBorn in Johannesburg in 1908, Kuper was raised in an orthodox Jewish family. He studied for BA and LLB degrees at the University of the Witwatersrand and practised law until the outbreak of the Second World War, acting in human-rights cases for African clients and representing one of the first non-racial trade unions, and he supported his beloved sister Mary when she helped to establish the first legal aid charity in South Africa. When war broke out he served as an intelligence officer with the Eighth Army in North Africa and Italy. After the war he organised the National War Memorial Health Foundation, which provided social and medical services for the disadvantaged.\n\nIn 1948 he began to train as a sociologist, first at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and then with Charles Madge at Birmingham University, where he wrote a pioneering study of urban planning, Living in Towns, based on research in Coventry. In 1953 he returned to South Africa as professor of sociology at the University of Natal in Durban. He was active in opposition politics and became chairman of the Natal branch of the Liberal Party. He wrote two classic studies on South African society, Passive Resistance in South Africa (1957), and An African Bourgeoisie (1965), both of which were banned by the government, and with two colleagues Durban: a study in racial ecology (1958). 'In present-day South Africa there is a strong tendency to regard as 'impartial' only those studies which abstain rigorously from any criticism of our present society,' Alan Paton wrote in his preface to that book, but he added - and this could have been said of all his South African studies - that Kuper scornfully resisted this false objectivity while nevertheless being careful to present all the relevant facts and to allow his readers to make up their own minds.\n\nWhen the National Party forced the universities to impose a racial test on entry Kuper wrote a bitter satire on the new tribal colleges, and despite the urgings of his friend Alan Paton he reluctantly decided to emigrate. In 1961 he accepted a position at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he remained until his retirement, serving for four years as Director of the African Studies Center. In 1963 his brother, my father, a judge in South Africa, was murdered, and Leo's commitment to peaceful social change became yet firmer. He published ground- breaking theoretical accounts of race and ethnic relations in plural societies, and then moved on to the great problem of genocidal violence.\n\nIn a series of three important books he analysed the major genocides of the 20th century, describing the factors that put a society at risk of genocidal violence and trying to identify forces that might prevent it (The Pity of it All, 1977; Genocide, 1981; and The Prevention of Genocide, 1985). The research was painful. For years he steeped himself in first-hand reports of the most hideous crimes, and I think he could hardly have borne it sometimes without the love and support of his wife, the anthropologist Hilda Kuper. Leo's gentle consideration and Hilda's warmth and hospitality made their home in Westwood Village a friendly and civilised haven for many intellectuals, refugees, students and friends of their daughters. Hilda's death in 1992 was a terrible blow.\n\nHe also set up an organisation, International Alert, with the help of Lord Young of Dartington, that was designed to provide early warning of ethnic violence, but he despaired of the record of the established international agencies. Writing of the massacres of Tutsi and Hutu in Rwanda and Burundi in the Sixties, he came to the conclusion that the intervention of international agencies and foreign governments had caused more deaths than they had prevented.\n\nHis unflinching analyses have a gruesome relevance to the horrors taking place today in the killing fields of Central Africa. He drove himself very hard, because he knew that there were not many scholars who could bear to contemplate these terrible events. For 20 years he was dealing with crimes that challenge any faith, but though he turned against religion he never lost the hope that the great social evils might be mitigated through informed intervention. If there was a Peace Prize for social scientists, Professor Michael Bantom once wrote, it would have been awarded first to Leo Kuper.\n\n(Photograph omitted)"}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/978-1-137-53142-1_16", "page_content": "Apple, M.

Consistent with traditional sociological understandings of social inequality, these axes of inequality have for the most part been considered individually, with researchers only considering potential interconnectedness when investigating whether class mediates associations between race and health or gender and health. Whether class influences health differently for visible minority Canadians and White Canadians or race influences health differently for men and women, for example, has not yet been investigated. When statistical interactions such as these have received analytical attention - for example, whether class influences health differently for Canadian men and women [3] - they have not been adequately theorized. Intersectionality theory, an influential theoretical tradition inspired by the feminist and antiracist traditions, demands that inequalities by race, gender, and class (and sexuality as well) be considered in tandem rather than distinctly. This is because these fundamental axes of inequality in contemporary societies are considered to be intrinsically entwined; they mutually constitute and reinforce one another and as such cannot be disentangled from one another. Intersectionality theory presents a new way of understanding social inequalities that possesses potential to uncover and explicate previously unknown health inequalities. This paper describes the results of an original empirical investigation of the degree to which the self-rated health of Canadians varies by race, gender, class, and/or sexual orientation in ways that are consistent with predictions of intersectionality theory. The remainder of this background section describes some of the central principles of this theoretical tradition followed by a description of the analytical strategy used to apply these principles in an empirical investigation of inequalities in self-rated health in Canada.\n\nIntersectionality theory\n\nIn the forward to a recent book on new theories and methods for studying race, class, and gender, Lynn Weber [6] describes how American women of color in the 1970s and early 1980s, many from working class backgrounds, came to critique the patriarchy tradition within gender studies for privileging gender over race and class (and subsequently critiqued the stratification tradition for privileging class over gender and race, etc.). They argued that these axes of inequality are in fact analytically inseparable, and that \"the multidimensionality and interconnected nature of race, class, and gender hierarchies were especially visible to those who faced oppression along more than one dimension of inequality\" [6:xii]. These scholars envisioned axes of inequality pertaining to gender, race, and class that intersect with one another, i.e., that are interlocked, dependent upon one another, and mutually constituted [7]. Power relationships along the lines of gender, race, and class were thought to be mutually defining and mutually reinforcing rather than analytically distinct systems of oppression, together forming a \"matrix of domination\" [8]. By the mid-1980s, lesbians of color had bridged the gap between gay and lesbian studies and the growing body of race, gender, and class research that had to that point ignored heterosexism [6], and axes of inequality pertaining to national origin, citizenship status, religion, disability, and age also received some attention. The contributions of these various scholars gave rise to what is now known as \"intersectionality theory.\" Landry [9] notes, however, that intersectionality theory does not provide a set of propositions that together form an explanation; rather, intersectionality theory currently consists of a loose set of principles or assumptions that are being applied and tested by many researchers in a variety of contexts.\n\nFounded upon analyses of relations of power in general and inspired by theories of racism, patriarchy, classism, and heterosexism in particular, in American intersectionality discourse the disadvantaged groups along the inequality axes of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation are assumed to be visible minorities from various backgrounds (especially African Americans), women, members of the lower and working classes, and gays, lesbians, and bisexuals. These comprise implicit intersectionality assumptions of \"directionality.\"\n\nIntersectionality theorists argue that our identities based on race, gender, class, and sexuality accompany us in every social interaction [7]. The principle of \"simultaneity\" maintains that all of the axes and their corresponding identities should be incorporated into social analyses.\n\n\"Race, class and gender may all structure a situation but may not be equally visible and/or important in people's self-definitions... This recognition that one category may have salience over another for a given time and place does not minimize the theoretical importance of assuming that race, class and gender as categories of analysis structure all relationships\" [7:560-1].\n\nThat is, while some axes and identities may be more pertinent to a specific social context or outcome than are others, simultaneity implies that a social researcher should never discard an axis of inequality before investigating its potential relevance for the problem at hand.\n\nIntersections between axes are thought to create complex social locations that are more central to the nature of social experiences than are any of the axes of inequality considered singly.\n\n\"People experience race, class, gender and sexuality differently depending upon their social location in the structures of race, class, gender and sexuality. For example, people of the same race will experience race differently depending upon their location in the class structure as working class, professional managerial class or unemployed; in the gender structure as female or male; and in structures of sexuality as heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual\" [10:326-7].\n\nThus \"multiplicativity\" should supplant additivity [10]. Racism x sexism x classism x sexism should replace racism + sexism + classism + sexism [11, 12]. A lower-class Black lesbian is necessarily all of these things, and their mutual manifestation represents a unique state of being and a unique set of social experiences and structural constraints.\n\n\"Race, class, gender and sexuality are not reducible to individual attributes to be measured and assessed for their separate contribution in explaining social outcomes, an approach that Elizabeth Spelman calls \"pop-bead metaphysics,\" where a woman's identity consists of the sum of parts neatly divisible from one another. The matrix of domination seeks to account for the multiple ways that women experience themselves as gendered, raced, classed and sexualized\" [10:327].\n\nExperiences of gender are racialized, sexualized, and classed; experiences of class are gendered, racialized, and sexualized, etc.\n\nFrom the abovementioned principles of directionality, simultaneity, and multiplicativity arise new versions of double jeopardy and triple jeopardy, renamed \"multiple jeopardy\" by Deborah King [11], wherein disadvantaged identities experienced in tandem are seen to result in inordinate, i.e., even more than additive, amounts of disadvantage. Thus complex social locations comprised of disadvantaged identities held in tandem are thought to lead to multiplicative disadvantage; that is, combinations of these identities are thought to have an aggravating rather than a simply cumulative or mitigating effect. In addition, because of the relational nature of intersectional theories, some complex locations, such as the one inhabited by wealthy heterosexual White men, in turn experience multiplicative advantage.\n\nDespite the immense popularity of intersectionality theory in humanities and social sciences circles and the large and growing body of intersectionality research that includes applications of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, very little quantitative research has explicitly applied intersectionality theory to health outcomes. However, many health determinants researchers have unintentionally addressed simultaneity and multiplicativity by identifying two-way statistical interactions between axes of inequality in regression modeling. In Canada, Zheng Wu and colleagues [2] identified interactions between race and socioeconomic status for depression. In the United States, Ostrove and colleagues [13] identified interactions between socioeconomic status and race as predictors of self-rated health and depression, Nomagushi [14] found interactions between race and gender on the effect of marital dissolution on depression, and Read and Gorman [15] determined that the gender gap in health differs widely by racial/ethnic group. But only a few quantitative studies have explicitly studied illness states associated with complex social positions arising from intersections between three axes of inequality [16\u201319], none of them Canadian, and no studies have studied intersections between all four of the primary axes of inequality of intersectionality theory. Given the seeming complicity of all of race [2, 20\u201323], gender [3, 4, 24], class [5, 25\u201329], and sexual orientation [30\u201333] in North American health inequalities, this lack of attention to health inequalities that accrue to multiple combinations of inequality identities represents an important gap in the health determinants literature.\n\nAnalytical strategy\n\nModeling the main effects of inequality identities (additivity) and then statistical interactions between them (multiplicativity) in multivariate regression models on health can establish whether two-way or three-way statistical interactions (intersections) between axes of inequality contribute to explaining variability in health above and beyond the additive approach to health inequalities that currently dominates health determinants research. This paper uses a two-stage analytical strategy, the first additive and the second multiplicative, applied to a large representative survey dataset from Canada in order to investigate health outcomes associated with intersections between race, gender, class, and sexual orientation.\n\nFirst, the strength and direction of the main effects in additive regression models such as Race + Gender + Class + Sexual Orientation = Health addresses the principles of simultaneity and directionality. Simultaneity suggests that all four identities will make significant contributions to these models before and/or after controlling for one another while directionality implies that non-Whites, women, lower-class people, and non-heterosexuals will manifest the poorer health outcomes.\n\nSecond, simultaneity and multiplicativity imply that the inequality identities should interact meaningfully with one another as predictors of health, that is, statistical interactions between the inequality variables of race, gender, class, and sexual orientation should manifest significant effects above and beyond their main effects in the abovementioned additive models. The existence of interactions speaks to multiplicativity. The qualities of the interactions themselves speak to multiple jeopardy and directionality. At least three multiplicative scenarios are possible for a given statistical interaction: 1. two or more axes of inequality manifest directions of some kind or other in additive models and then display an aggravating effect in the interaction between them, 2. two or more axes manifest given directions in additive models and then display a mitigating effect in their interaction, and 3. an interaction manifests itself between two or more axes but not all of the axes display independent effects in additive models. Aggravating effects support the assumption of multiple jeopardy and reinforce the directionality identified in the additive models whereas non-aggravating effects run contrary to the assumption of multiple jeopardy and complicate directionality. Finally, contributions to predicted variability in the models address multiplicativity by providing an indication of the \"value added\" of the statistical interactions; comparisons of R2 values between regression models with and without the cross-product terms can be used to assess the magnitude of their contributions to explaining variability in health above and beyond the contributions of the main effects."}]}
