Australian TV was in its infancy when Tristan came onto the scene, working as a walk-on stuntman and doubling as a boom carrier. Ambitious, and eager to learn, Tristan also did sound effects in the parking lot at night and volunteered for any other work which would keep him on the lot and in peoples eyesight. It wasn't long before he landed a series regular role in The Link Men. When the struggling production folded after about 10 episodes, Tristan headed for England.\n\nThe year was 1969 and Tristan thought he'd try being a drummer in a rock band on for size. After three years of \"intense experiences\" in London, and witnessing live some of the greatest music ever to hit planet Earth, Tristan decided to give up the musician's life. What he had learned after years of successful modeling to help make the band's ends meet, was that he really wanted to act.\n\nBack in Australia in 1972, Tristan found himself working in all manner of local productions. For the next seven years it was non-stop work in everything form television to radio. By then, the idea of coming to America had taken hold, so in 1979 it was time to move again. Tristan arrived in California in the summer of 1979 and felt right at home.\n\nIn December of 1980, Tristan landed a job in a show called General Hospital and his life changed forever. An outpouring from fascinated fans of all ages turned then-producer Gloria Monty's head and changed the initial three-week gig into a three-year contract role. General Hospital opened many doors for him with appearances on most of the then prominent '80's and '90's television series.\n\nIn 1992, Tristan made the momentous decision to leave General Hospital and seek other challenges. He had always felt that it is after all show business and that he had only participated in one portion of it. In order to do the other he had to commit to it. His first experience on the production side came about in 1996. Tristan had spent several years researching a show about what is arguably his first love, motor racing. In 1997, Tristan found himself in Canada where he was instrumental in launching a show for the Showtime Network called Fast Track, set in the world of American stock-car racing. The show lasted for 22 episodes and the learning experience was priceless.\n\nIn addition to producing, Tristan continues to appear in major films and television shows, as well as being the spokes voice for several major TV ad campaigns. Always a little ahead of his time, Tristan has also been a key figure in the development of internet-based soaps. An avid and vocal proponent of the development of web-based entertainment, Tristan is also involved in web-based productions.\n\nActing Portfolio: TELEVISION\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nColin Atkinson\n\nDecember 8, 2010 to October 25, 2011; May 9, 2012\n\nGeneral Hospital: Night Shift\n\nRobert Scorpio\n\nAugust 5, 2008 to October 21, 2008\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nHunter Jones\n\n1997\n\nFast Track\n\nHarry\n\n1997\n\nA Perry Mason Mystery: The Case of the Lethal Lifestyle\n\nDuke Albert\n\n1994\n\nCaptain Planet and the Planeteers\n\nCaucasian Patrol Member (voice)\n\n1990\n\nSky Commanders\n\n'Spider' Reilly\n\n1987\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nRobert Scorpio\n\nDecember 1980 to February 25, 1992 [contract]; 1995; January 27, 2006 to March 1, 2006; October 20, 2006 to November 16, 2006; December 19, 2008 to December 29, 2008; February 29, 2012 to March 8, 2012; November 15, 2012 to December 18, 2012; October 4, 2013 to present\n\nPower Without Glory\n\nPeter Monton\n\n1976\n\nThe Box\n\nPeter Kendall\n\n1975-1976\n\nNumber 96\n\nCain Carmichael\n\n1974\n\nThe Link Men\n\nDetective Constable Ray Gamble\n\n1970\n\nBellbird\n\n1967\n\nActing Portfolio: FILM\n\nA Piece of Eden\n\nVictor Hardwick\n\n2000\n\nNight Eyes Three\n\nJim Stanton\n\n1993\n\nSoulmates\n\nRichard Wayborn\n\n1992\n\nThe Rescuers Down Under\n\nJake (voice)\n\n1990\n\nSex Farm\n\nRobert Waitman\n\n1973\n\nThe Flesh and Blood Show\n\nTony Weller\n\n1972\n\nFour Dimensions of Greta\n\nHans Wiemer\n\n1972\n\nVital Statistics\n\nPLACE OF BIRTH: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia\n\nDATE OF BIRTH: June 3, 1946\n\nHEIGHT: 6' 1\"\n\nMARITAL STATUS: Married, Teresa Parkerson (May 21, 1995 to Present)\n\nCHILDREN: Two; daughter, Sara Jane (Aug 15, 1992) and son, Cale (Aug 1996)"}, {"url": "https://soaps.sheknows.com/gallery/general-hospital-old-pictures-1960s-1970s-1980s-1990s/", "page_content": "\u2018JaSam\u2019 I Am?\n\nImage Credit: Chris D/JPI\n\nJason found lasting love with Sonny\u2019s former squeeze, Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco).

He left school in 1964 and \u201cgoosed around for about two years and basically pissed [his] parents off\u201d then he and some friends started a rock band. It wasn\u2019t long before, at 21 years old, he realized they couldn\u2019t make any real money so Rogers started doing commercials and some modeling work \u2014 and made good money.\n\nMore: Tristan Rogers shares stories from early GH days\n\nWhen he decided he wanted to start acting, without any acting classes under his belt, Rogers had no idea what the ramifications of that would be and about to commitment you had to make. \u201cAs far as I was concerned, it was a way to make a bit of money. That\u2019s all.\u201d His first audition was in a lobby, while a janitor mopped, and he started doing under-five roles. When he learned about a new cop series in Sydney, he moved and landed the part as a detective on The Link Men. From there he went to London, reconnected with his former producer and landed his next role on Paul Temple, without an audition, which was a huge success and really was his \u201cstart in the industry.\u201d\n\nMore: Why Robert and Laura never became a couple\n\nSo, what came next? In 1972, Rogers worked at a discotech and joked, \u201cCome on, every actor works as a barman, a cabman, drives a cab.\u201d However, when the disc jockey didn\u2019t turn up on New Year\u2019s Eve, Rogers volunteered then froze in front of a full house \u2014 until he figured it out and realized, \u201cThis is fun.\u201d After buying a guy\u2019s equipment and music, he got hired at a club in London.\n\nWhen that didn\u2019t pan out, Rogers consulted on commercial radio, which led to a memorable moment getting to see Elton John and Kiki Dee headline a show. But then Rogers\u2019 visa ran out and he was forced to leave the country.\n\nMore: Why Luke and Laura\u2019s wedding almost didn\u2019t happen\n\nListen as he explains how it all went down but be aware, Rogers is a tell-it-like-it-is guy, which means a bit of salty language!\n\nNow that we\u2019ve heard Rogers\u2019 story, find out what other actors did before they were stars in our gallery below.\n\nVideo: State of Mind/YouTube"}, {"url": "https://www.soapcentral.com/general-hospital/news/2020/1202-tristan_rogers_marks_40_gh_years.php", "page_content": "Posted Wednesday, December 02, 2020 10:46:17 AM\n\nTime to bust out the Champagne and give a toast to Tristan Rogers, who is celebrating his 40th anniversary of playing Robert Scorpio!

Tristan Rogers made his debut in December of 1980 and played the popular character until 1992, making various returns in the years since. Every time this super spy shows up on GH, he brings the action and the drama, and now it looks like he\u2019ll be around for a while!\n\nRobert first appeared in Port Charles tracking Luke Spencer and Alexandra Quartermaine in search of the Ice Princess, which was really a large uncut diamond containing the secret to carbonic snow. Although Luke and Robert initially thought they were enemies, when they realized they were on the same side, they teamed up to stop the Cassadines from freezing the world. Following the adventure, Robert resigned from the World Security Bureau because they disagreed about destroying the Ice Princess and its formula. He briefly dated Tiffany Hill, who he\u2019d met during the caper, but their romance fizzled.\n\nRobert, Laura, and Luke\u2019s trip to Cassadine Island was anything but a vacation!

Robert was already helping Luke track down his missing wife, and they discovered David Gray had arranged for Laura Spencer\u2019s disappearance. After Luke killed David in a sword fight, they were led to believe Laura had drowned at sea, and Robert consoled his grieving friend.\n\nAfter he and Luke were caught up in an oil scam orchestrated by Holly Sutton\u2019s family, Robert ended up marrying the Brit. See, she was pregnant with Luke\u2019s baby and since he was presumed dead at the time, Robert made her his wife so she wouldn\u2019t be deported. Sadly, she miscarried the child, but Holly and Robert eventually found love.\n\nJackie wasn\u2019t thrilled when Holly\u2019s eyes turned from Luke to Robert in the end. Erik Hein/ABC via Getty Images\n\nWhen Mac Scorpio first came to town, Robert had a rocky relationship with his brother because he blamed him for the death of their parents. Thankfully they were able to bury the hatchet before Robert and his wife, Anna Devane, were presumed dead in 1992, leaving their teenage daughter, Robin, to be raised by Mac.\n\nRobert resurfaced in 2006, five years after Anna, to reveal that he was forced to go into hiding by the WBS and couldn\u2019t tell anyone where he was. He was tracking down a lethal strain of encephalitis from the South Pacific which menaced Port Charles. Later, Robert was diagnosed with colon cancer, and after slipping into a coma, he recovered and went to Europe for further treatment.\n\nLuke talked his friend off the ledge\u2026 literally! Rick Rowell/ABC via Getty Images\n\nAfter Robin was presumed dead in an explosion, Robert returned to Port Charles in 2012 and even contemplated taking his own life out of grief over not being able to protect his daughter. Thankfully, Luke was able to talk his friend down. Later, Luke brought Robert back to town to investigate the return of Duke Lavery who they soon discovered to be Cesar Faison in disguise. After locating the real Duke, Robert saw Robin alive but was put into a coma by Dr. Liesl Obrecht to keep him quiet. When he finally awoke, Robert managed to convince Anna their daughter was alive and after an adventure that found them held prisoner temporarily by Jerry Jax, they were reunited with Robin.\n\nRobert helped keep Anna from taking revenge by killing Faison, and later also helped her deal with her rage towards Carlos after he\u2019d killed Duke. In the spring of 2018, the spy appeared in Switzerland to offer Anna help in tracking down her son, Henrik Faison. As he was getting too close to the truth, Valentin Cassadine drugged and imprisoned Robert, but the truth couldn\u2019t be kept hidden for long!\n\n\u201dDo as I say, not as I do, Anna.\u201d XJJohnson/jpistudios.com\n\nRobert reappeared in Port Charles to take Peter/Henrik into custody but he cut a deal to stay out of prison. He also enlisted Finn\u2019s help to find a missing Anna, and when it turned out she was just bait to abduct Finn, Robert had to help them both escape their kidnappers. He then helped Anna track down Alex so she could get to the bottom of the mysterious virus that temporarily took away her eyesight. Of course, the spy was also a thorn in Finn\u2019s side as he prepared to propose to Anna, but nobody\u2019s perfect! Robert also aided Sonny in his search for Dante, journeying with him to Turkey to bring the guy home. Unfortunately, Dante had to leave again to undergo treatment for his PTSD and Robert was forced into retirement by the WSB.\n\nAfter Margaux Dawson resigned, Robert was hired as Port Charles\u2019 newest district attorney, since he apparently attended law school before being recruited by the WSB. This put him at the forefront of keeping Port Charles crime-free, which is a lot of work!\n\nABC\n\nRobert was shaken to hear reports that Holly had died while on WSB business, but remained skeptical, refusing to believe that she was really gone. He brought Olivia Falconeri to the WSB facility in Switzerland to visit her son, Dante, but he refused to see her. Before returning to Port Charles, they attended Holly\u2019s memorial service in England, but Robert was stunned to get a phone call that sounded like Holly begging him to help her! Olivia tagged along as Robert flew to Monte Carlo to investigate and find out what was really going on, and they got some help from Ethan Lovett, who was also after his mom, but they ultimately returned to Port Charles unable to rescue Holly.\n\nAfter their trip, Robert remained friendly with Olivia but kept his distance as it had put a strain on her marriage to Ned. He continued to work to help bring Peter August to justice and was devastated when Anna reported news that their old friend, Sean Donely, had passed away.\n\nRobert teamed up with Anna again to help stop Peter and was stunned to learn that Victor Cassadine was not only alive, but allied with the villain! After returning from Greece, Robert was stunned when a drunk Olivia kissed him and a jealous Ned punched him, but he was able to clear the air and help Olivia repair her marriage. He then traveled with Anna to Cassadine Island where they took Peter into custody.\n\nStay tuned to see what happens next!\n\nLove GH?

But it\u2019s Robert Scorpio for which he\u2019ll always be best known.\n\nNonetheless, Rogers doesn\u2019t regret his decision to leave General Hospital in 1992. \u201cI kind of had to get away from it,\u201d he explained to Soap Opera Digest in 2019. \u201cI was very unhappy being on the show at that time\u2026 I had a real yearning to do something else.\u201d\n\nSo he did a whole lot of \u201csomething else,\u201d from Showtime\u2019s NASCAR-racing drama Fast Track to Babylon 5 (pictured below) to voice work on animated shows such as Captain Planet and the Planeteers and Batman Beyond. Finally, after making a few \u201cspectral\u201d returns to General Hospital, Rogers raised Robert from the grave in 2006.\n\nSo today, on the anniversary of our introduction to his iconic character, why not celebrate by looking through the below photo gallery, which reviews his life and many, many loves in Port Charles?"}, {"url": "https://ew.com/article/2015/10/29/tristan-rogers-general-hospital/", "page_content": "He\u2019s back.

Since 1980, the dashing Australian actor has wowed fans, primarily with his long-running on-and-off iconic role on General Hospital (Robert Scorpio, 1980 \u2013 present), though he\u2019s also appeared on The Young and the Restless (Colin Atkinson), The Bay (Lex Martin), Studio City (Doc) and The Bold and the Beautiful (Hunter Jones). Over the years, fans have followed his adventures through virtually every form of law enforcement \u2013 he\u2019s been a private detective, a super spy, a police commissioner and a district attorney \u2013 but there\u2019s much more to the actor than first meets the eye, as fans know. Here are 11 tidbits about the wonder from Down Under you might not have heard before\u2026\n\nTristan Rogers\u2019 character has had a long, winding path through General Hospital over the years. A spy with the WSB agency, he shared adventures with Luke and Laura during their heyday, departed in 1992 as \u201ckilled with no body found,\u201d returned as a spirit to comfort his daughter Robin 1995 and then popped up, still living in 2006. He\u2019s been on-and-off again ever since \u2013 even while appearing on The Young and the Restless.\n\nMore: Exclusive, Days actress reveals upcoming novel\n\nOutside soaps, he\u2019s done voice-over work in movies like The Rescuers Down Under (1990) and in the video game based on Mad Max, plus in ads for Outback Steakhouse, Foster\u2019s Lager, Reebok and Epson.\n\nRogers is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and has lived in Palm Springs, California since 1994.\n\nWhen he was 16 he worked at a friend\u2019s father\u2019s printing shop \u2013 but failed terribly. \u201cI could never get that printing press to work,\u201d he shared in a 2014 interview. \u201cAbout three weeks later we realized that printing was not going to be my profession.\u201d He classed that job as his \u201cworst\u201d ever.\n\nOne of his early film jobs in his career was in a movie originally titled Sex Farm \u2013 which was later renamed Frustrated Wives. The movie was about \u201ca pair of frustrated housewives who are bored and neglected by their husbands\u201d who \u201cdecide to go to a \u2018sex clinic\u2019 in the country.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s his favorite General Hospital story of all time? Over the years, Rogers has expressed how much he enjoyed doing the Ice Princess story in 1980, which was a diamond that had been painted black \u2013 with untold powers the Cassadines would do anything to obtain. Robert Scorpio showed up for the first time in the story, working with Luke and Laura on the Cassadines\u2019 private island, where they discovered that Mikkos was going to hold the world for ransom using the Ice Princess. (Hey, we said it was powerful.)\n\nMore: GH fan fiction, someone is held at gunpoint\n\nIn the new millennium, Rogers has worked closely with fellow actor Sean Kanan (General Hospital, A.J. Quartermaine; The Bold and the Beautiful/The Young and the Restless, Deacon Sharpe; Sunset Beach, Jude Cavanagh; The Bay, Kenneth Allen; Studio City, Sam Stevens), on multiple projects, including Studio City and the soap-star-studded film Jack Rio (2008), which also featured soap actors Brian Krause (Another World, Matthew Cory), James Patrick Stuart (All My Children, Will Cortlandt; 90210, Charles Clark; General Hospital, Valentin Cassadine), Nadia Bjorlin (Days of our Lives, Chloe Lane; Venice the Series, Lara Miller; Beacon Hill, Sara Preston) and Matthew Borlenghi (All My Children, Brian Bodine; The Bold and the Beautiful, Ziggy Deadmarsh; Days of our Lives, Anthony Marino).\n\nRogers has been married twice: to Barbara Meale (1974 \u2013 1984), and Teresa Parkerson (1995 \u2013 present). He and Theresa have two children: Sara Jane, born in 1992, and Cale, born in 1996.\n\nOn General Hospital, Robert fell for Luke\u2019s lady Holly (Laura was out of the picture by then) \u2013 and in real life, the two actors dated for over a year. Swoon!\n\nRogers is both athletic and mechanically-minded, and has a slew of hobbies related to both: he\u2019s built model cars, he does his own bicycle maintenance, and loves driving race cars. He\u2019s also a runner and rides his bike in the annual Tour de Palm Springs \u2013 and loves to fish and skeet shoot.\n\nHe calls it \u201chokey\u201d on Twitter, but Rogers has been participating in a web series during quarantine called Six Blocks Apart, where he speaks with his neighbors in Palm Springs via Zoom.

Tristan Rogers, who plays the lovable Robert Scorpio on the daytime drama, is returning to the role that he originated back in 1980.\n\nIt was posted on the official GH site, and also confirmed by Executive Producer Frank Valentini on his Twitter account, that the longtime actor will be coming back this December. He has been gone for almost two years now, so fans will be thrilled to have him back. Valentini had this to say about Tristan\u2019s anticipated return.\n\n\u201cScorpio is such a beloved legacy character who evokes a sense of nostalgia and I know the fans have been patiently waiting for Tristan\u2019s return. I share their sentiments and enthusiasm and that of our entire GH team in welcoming him home.\u201d\n\nTristan Rogers is also happy to come back to his stomping grounds on General Hospital. He has been one of the most beloved characters on the soap for many years, and this news will definitely spread quickly. Rogers had this to say about his return.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to be visiting my friends in PC. Stand by for some fun stuff.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Robert Scorpio returning to General Hospital this winter, it was recently announced that daughter Robin Scorpio, played by actress Kimberly McCullough, is also returning. There is no word yet on how long Robin is sticking around Port Charles, but viewers are probably hoping that there will be a Scorpio reunion between these two, and also mom Anna Devane (Finola Hughes). It is always a delight to see these three actors together on screen.\n\nRobert Scorpio is known as the dashing super spy with the adorable Australian accent. He was one of the leading men on General Hospital back in the 80\u2019s as he battled bad guys with Luke Spencer and had noted romances with both Anna Devane and Holly Sutton. After his latest departure from the ABC soap in 2014, Tristan returned to The Young and the Restless in the role of Colin Atkinson, leaving Scorpio behind.\n\nNow that he is coming back to Port Charles, he will get to spend some time with his granddaughter Emma Drake as well. It may be a good thing to have her grandpa\u2019s shoulder to cry on because it looks like her daddy\u2019s new, or soon-to-be wife Sam, may be going back to her not-so-dead husband, Jason Morgan, after she finds out that he is alive and well.\n\nThis Scorpio family reunion is most likely just temporary as Jason Thompson is rumored to be leaving his role as Robert\u2019s ex-son-in-law, Patrick Drake soon. This whole thing may just have to do with him leaving. Robin Scorpio\u2019s on screen time is just temporary and she may be taking Patrick with her. There is no word on just how long Tristan Rogers is sticking around, but it will be great to have him no matter how long he stays.\n\nRobert could also be coming back to help Anna out of her Carlos Rivera dilemma. She is feeling the heat from Paul Hornsby at the moment and may just need the expertise of the former WSB agent to get her out of it.\n\nThis has been quite an exciting week for General Hospital fans who love these beloved soap characters, but there may be even more casting news coming. Frank Valentini teased in his statement that there could be more news for viewers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a fantastic week of casting announcements for GH, but it\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\n\nWhat does he mean by that? Could there be another familiar face coming to Port Charles very soon?\n\nWho would you like to see come back to General Hospital?
