His father, Roy Beggs, was also a politician, having served as the UUP Member of Parliament (MP) for East Antrim from 1983 to 2005. Beggs Jr served as a local councillor on Carrickfergus Borough Council from 2001 to 2011, during which time he held various positions of responsibility, including Chairman of the District Policing Partnership and Vice-Chairman of the Local Strategic Partnership and of the Community Safety Partnership.\n\nIn 2011, Beggs was elected as Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a role he held until 2016. During his time in the Assembly, he served as a member of various committees, including the Social Development Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Health Committee, Environment Committee, Finance Committee, and Agriculture Committee. He is also the UUP spokesperson on Social Development.\n\nBeggs is known for his actions in 2003, when he successfully lobbied Aer Lingus to remove Irish rebel music from their in-flight entertainment. Beggs had complained of the \"blatant promotion of militant, armed republicanism\" on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston. He likened the situation to \"the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.\" Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights immediately, stating that it should never have been on board in the first place.\n\nThroughout his career, Beggs has been known for his commitment to public safety and community development. He has been a strong advocate for increasing funding for mental health services, improving road safety, and promoting economic development in Northern Ireland. He has also been a vocal opponent of political violence and sectarianism, and has worked tirelessly to build bridges between different communities in the region.\n\nOverall, Roy Beggs Jr is a well-respected politician with a long track record of public service. His dedication to the people of East Antrim and Northern Ireland as a whole has earned him the admiration of his constituents and colleagues alike. As he moves on from his role as an MLA, his legacy will continue to be felt throughout the region for many years to come.\n\nElection results\n\nRoy Beggs Jr, a seasoned politician and long-standing member of the Northern Ireland Assembly, suffered a shock defeat in the 2022 election at the hands of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland. This brought to an end his uninterrupted run of electoral successes since 1998.\n\nBeggs Jr had been a force to be reckoned with in the political landscape, having won the popular vote in two separate elections, and had been a key player in the Unionist cause for decades. However, his failure to secure re-election in 2022 has left many wondering where it all went wrong.\n\nDespite starting strong with a 16.1% share of the vote in 1998, Beggs Jr's popularity dwindled over time, with just 10.2% of the vote in 2007. While he had always been a prominent figure in Unionist politics, it seems that his appeal may have waned in recent years.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly is a notoriously volatile arena, with the political landscape shifting rapidly over time. Beggs Jr may have fallen foul of this instability, finding himself out of step with the changing attitudes of the electorate.\n\nOr perhaps it was simply a case of the Alliance Party capitalizing on a moment of weakness, seizing the opportunity to make their mark on the political landscape. Whatever the case, Beggs Jr's defeat is a timely reminder that no one can take electoral success for granted.\n\nIn the cutthroat world of politics, it's important to remain vigilant and adaptable, constantly reassessing one's position and staying on top of the latest trends and developments. Beggs Jr's defeat may be a bitter pill to swallow, but it serves as a valuable lesson for politicians everywhere.\n\nAs for the Alliance Party, they can take heart in their triumph, but they must not rest on their laurels. The political landscape is ever-changing, and they will need to remain vigilant if they hope to maintain their newfound dominance. One thing is certain, the Northern Ireland Assembly will remain a hotly contested arena for many years to come."}, {"url": "https://guernseypress.com/news/uk-news/2022/05/06/assembly-stalwarts-beggs-and-weir-lose-seats/", "page_content": "For the first time since East Antrim was created as a constituency in 1983, there will nobody from the Beggs family representing the area at either Stormont or Westminster.\n\nUlster Unionist Roy Beggs Jr, a former Stormont deputy speaker and party stalwart, was eliminated early in the voting process for the constituency, which covers the coastal towns of Carrickfergus and Larne.\n\nMr Beggs had been his party\u2019s longest serving MLA, having held the seat since 1998.\n\nThe Beggs association with the area is longstanding, with Roy Beggs Sr having been the first MP when electoral boundaries were redrawn to form the constituency area in the early 1980s.\n\nMr Beggs polled only 3,549 first preference votes, well behind the 6,195 for his party colleague John Stewart.\n\nMr Beggs was eliminated on the second count and left the count centre at Ulster University in Jordanstown early.\n\nHis fortunes mirrored those of his party, which has suffered a disappointing election, gaining just over 11% of first preference votes.\n\nThe DUP\u2019s Peter Weir has lost his seat in Strangford (Peter Morrison/PA)\n\nMr Weir had been an MLA since 1998 when the Assembly was first created following the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nThe DUP previously held three seats in the constituency and was always likely to struggle to hold them all, with Mr Weir the casualty."}, {"url": "https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2022/05/07/news/end-of-the-beggs-dynasty-in-east-antrim-2663204/", "page_content": "DUP former Economy Minister Gordon Lyons pictured at the Assembly elections count at Jordanstown.

You're 55 and married to Sandra (\"we're of a similar age\"), a former retail manager who now works as a part-time secretary in your constituency office. You have three children - Stewart (26), a dentist; Matthew (24), a civil engineer; and Amy (23), a final year dentistry student. You've been married for 28 years. How did you two meet?\n\nA. Our eyes met on the dance floor at a Young Farmers dance five years before we got married. We went to London and then Malta on honeymoon.\n\nQ. Your father and namesake Roy (81) is a retired school vice-principal and former East Antrim MP, and your (\"slightly younger\") mum Wilma was an administrator before focusing on running the family farm outside Larne. You also have a brother Ian (57), a qualified engineer who works on the farm, and two sisters - Roma (56), a physiotherapist, and Lorraine (53), a dentist. What was growing up like?\n\nA. We'd a happy childhood and we made our own innocent fun. We made tunnels through the hayshed, explored the wild Glynn river valley and returned with sticks which we used to make improvised pole vaults and we filled bran bags full of straw as a landing area. It was fun. I smile when I think about it.\n\nQ. How much influence has your dad had on your career?\n\nA. We have a similar outlook on many issues, but not all. Occasionally I've compared notes with him but the best advice he gave me was to decide for myself because I will have to satisfy myself in the long-term with the decision made.\n\nQ. You're in the rather unusual position of having received death threats from both loyalists opposing the peace process and dissident republicans. Tell us about that.\n\nA. In 1999 we were told there was going to be a hit on one Ulster Unionist MLA one particular weekend, and I was among those approached by police officers acting on specific information. On the other occasion, in the early 2000s, the police had found a list with my name on it...\n\nQ. In 2003 you succeeded in having Irish rebel music removed from Aer Lingus's in-flight entertainment. Was it a tough battle?\n\nA. I was on a flight from Dublin to Boston - at that stage the DUP wouldn't have flown through Dublin - and was surprised to hear music advocating the IRA. I simply asked: \"Would Arabian Airlines be playing music advocating Osama Bin Laden?\" The issue was resolved quickly. It's important that we don't glorify terrorism and do everything we can to prevent young people being drawn into organised crime gangs here.\n\nQ. You're considered to be one of the more hardline members of the UUP. Did your father's suspension from the DUP in 1981 and subsequent defection to the UUP influence your party choice? Was there ever a time you though you might go to the DUP?\n\nA. No, I feel much more at home with the UUP. Their approach to unionism, of reasonable accommodation with our neighbours, is the best method of guaranteeing Northern Ireland's position within the UK, rather than the 'them and us' approach of others.\n\nQ. Do you believe in God? Do you have a strong faith?\n\nA. I do. I was recently appointed as an elder in Raloo Presbyterian Church in Larne. I've also served as a Boys' Brigade officer there for 20 years.\n\nQ. Have you ever lost anyone else close to you, and does death frighten you?\n\nA. Grandparents. As a family we all would have been very close. Death doesn't frighten me - if you're prepared to meet your maker, what's to fear?\n\nQ. You like watching sport, cycling and taking long country walks with your family, and relaxing with the odd glass of red wine. You also used to love playing rugby. How do you relax outside politics?\n\nA. I also help my dad on the farm by way of keeping fit. Before work this morning, for example, I put a lot of silage into a wheelbarrow and fed the cattle with it.\n\nQ. You often hear about the dangers of working with animals. Have you had any close encounters?\n\nA. I've had to jump a gate to get out of a pen after being chased by a cow that had just calved. I was trying to help the calf get onto its first feed when its mother went for me, but I escaped unscathed.\n\nA mother of a young calf is more dangerous than a bull, and statistics prove that.\n\nQ. Have you had any bad experiences with the media?\n\nA. Peter Robinson once called me a \"loathsome creature\" in the Press when I backed David Trimble. That was my first real experience in politics of someone being nasty, but it says a lot more about Peter Robinson than it does about me.\n\nQ. Tell us about the best day of your life so far.\n\nA. My wedding day - October 20, 1989 - when my beautiful wife finally turned up after making me wait a while.\n\nQ. And what about the worst day of your life? What's the most traumatic thing you've been through?\n\nA. The day my son Stewart, who was four, broke his leg in an accident with a link box on the farm. I had to meet him at A&E before he was transferred to hospital.\n\nI remember spending a few nights in a chair at the side of his bed.\n\nHe was very young to be in hospital. He had an operation to have his leg re-set but initially we didn't know how serious it was going to be.\n\nMy dad almost lost his leg when he was in his 20s.\n\nHe was climbing a wall when the top of it fell on him.\n\nSurgeons were recommending amputation at one stage.\n\nQ. Which politician from the so-called 'other side' do you most admire?\n\nA. The SDLP's Mark H Durkan, for his wit.\n\nQ. As the son of a Westminster politician, did you ever foresee a time when there would be no Ulster Unionist MPs? And will there be any in the future?\n\nA. I wouldn't have foreseen that. The current impasse might well result in new political arrangements being made. I suspect the most damaging change has been the St Andrews Agreement, which has created the race to vote for one extreme or the other, which in turn has polarised political representation. Despite RHI and Nama, people believe they have to vote DUP to stop Sinn Fein getting in.\n\nQ. How do you feel about the current stalemate?\n\nA. I'm very frustrated, particularly when receiving complaints from constituents having to wait unreasonably long for health service treatment. There's a wide range of decisions that aren't being made, and we can't continue without ministers in post. There will either have to be devolved ministers appointed, or authority passed to direct rule.\n\nQ. Do you think being an MLA is easy money these days?\n\nA. We aren't doing the full job that we're elected to do and it's time for change.\n\nQ. What's the most important piece of advice you've been given?\n\nA. Decide for yourself, because you-have to live with the long-term consequences of your actions and decisions.\n\nDad gave that to me at a critical time in the peace process. He and I ended up taking different views on a vote prior to going into government in 1999. He had a more hardline approach than me. I ultimately decided to support Trimble in the establishment of the first Executive when IRA decommissioning hadn't yet taken place. We didn't fall out. I did so to apply pressure on Sinn Fein so they couldn't blame unionism for any collapse of the Assembly at that time.\n\nQ. If you were in trouble, who is the one person you would turn to?\n\nA. Probably my dad - and my wife.\n\nQ. Who was your biggest inspiration growing up?\n\nA. My dad. He was a strict disciplinarian; he was the enforcer at Larne High School. He worked hard and looked after us, and he was always very good in company. He knew a lot of people. He and mum are also fantastic dancers.\n\nQ. Who is your best Catholic friend?\n\nA. I was always taught to treat people as you find them. At school I played with a mixed group at lunchtime and on the school teams, as was the case when I played for the Firsts at Larne Rugby Club. We all worked together for whatever team we played on.\n\nQ. What's your favourite place?\n\nA. Castlerock. I had a wee touring caravan and most summers our family usually went there or Benone.\n\nQ. What is your greatest achievement to date?\n\nA. I developed a children and young people's group in Carrickfergus which ultimately was successful in establishing a Sure Start, helping mums and young children in parts of Carrickfergus and Larne.\n\nQ. Have you ever had a nickname?\n\nA. Beggsy\n\nQ. What's the craziest thing you've ever done?\n\nA. When I was 19 a group of us elected to go waterskiing in Newferry in December - which I did without a suitable wetsuit. I remember going for a run afterwards to get warmed up and then subsequently discovering I'd been running with a thorn in my heel, but because it was so cold I couldn't feel it.\n\nQ. You and Sandra live in Glenoe while Stewart works in London, Matthew is \"drilling tunnels under cities in Canada\" and Amy is currently studying in Dundee. You must miss them?\n\nA. I do. I hope they all come back at some point but they're adults and have to decide things for themselves. But it took a while getting used to all three being away.\n\nQ. You went to Glynn Primary and Larne Grammar before spending a year out on company placement and then heading to Queen's to study engineering. Briefly tell us about your career to date.\n\nA. Immediately prior to becoming an MLA I worked as a production manager for five years at (the now closed) Simms and Young.\n\nBefore that I worked for different manufacturing companies in production management.\n\nQ. You became involved in politics at university, joined the Young Unionists and served as secretary of the Ulster Young Unionist Council (UYUC). You were also constituency secretary at your local UUP branch. Was your dad a major influence in your decision to enter politics?\n\nA. There was always some politics discussed over the kitchen table, although I was the only family member actively involved - I helped my dad put up posters at election time.\n\nAt university I took part in the Young Unionist protest march against the Anglo-Irish Agreement from Londonderry to Belfast.\n\nI never made any political ambitions for myself but I originally thought at some point that I might become a councillor.\n\nQ. If the Assembly collapses, what's next for you?\n\nA. More time farming and I'll look for an engineering management role."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/roy.beggs/941555", "page_content": "Roy BEGGS\n\nMember of Parliament\n\nFebruary 20, 1936 Ballyclare, County Antrim, United Kingdom\n\nForeign the Democratic Unionist Party. he moved to the Ulster Unionist Party and was re-elected in 1981 as a \"loyalist\".

We aren\u2019t doing the full job that we\u2019re elected to do and it\u2019s time for change.\n\nQ. What\u2019s the most important piece of advice you\u2019ve been given?\n\nA. Decide for yourself, because you-have to live with the long-term consequences of your actions and decisions.\n\nDad gave that to me at a critical time in the peace process. He and I ended up taking different views on a vote prior to going into government in 1999. He had a more hardline approach than me. I ultimately decided to support Trimble in the establishment of the first Executive when IRA decommissioning hadn\u2019t yet taken place. We didn\u2019t fall out. I did so to apply pressure on Sinn Fein so they couldn\u2019t blame unionism for any collapse of the Assembly at that time.\n\nQ. If you were in trouble, who is the one person you would turn to?\n\nA. Probably my dad \u2013 and my wife.\n\nQ. Who was your biggest inspiration growing up?\n\nA. My dad. He was a strict disciplinarian; he was the enforcer at Larne High School. He worked hard and looked after us, and he was always very good in company. He knew a lot of people. He and mum are also fantastic dancers.\n\nQ. Who is your best Catholic friend?\n\nA. I was always taught to treat people as you find them. At school I played with a mixed group at lunchtime and on the school teams, as was the case when I played for the Firsts at Larne Rugby Club. We all worked together for whatever team we played on.\n\nQ. What\u2019s your favourite place?\n\nA. Castlerock. I had a wee touring caravan and most summers our family usually went there or Benone.\n\nQ. What is your greatest achievement to date?\n\nA. I developed a children and young people\u2019s group in Carrickfergus which ultimately was successful in establishing a Sure Start, helping mums and young children in parts of Carrickfergus and Larne.\n\nQ. Have you ever had a nickname?\n\nA. Beggsy\n\nQ. What\u2019s the craziest thing you\u2019ve ever done?\n\nA. When I was 19 a group of us elected to go waterskiing in Newferry in December \u2013 which I did without a suitable wetsuit. I remember going for a run afterwards to get warmed up and then subsequently discovering I\u2019d been running with a thorn in my heel, but because it was so cold I couldn\u2019t feel it.\n\nQ. You and Sandra live in Glenoe while Stewart works in London, Matthew is \u201cdrilling tunnels under cities in Canada\u201d and Amy is currently studying in Dundee. You must miss them?\n\nA. I do. I hope they all come back at some point but they\u2019re adults and have to decide things for themselves. But it took a while getting used to all three being away.\n\nQ. You went to Glynn Primary and Larne Grammar before spending a year out on company placement and then heading to Queen\u2019s to study engineering. Briefly tell us about your career to date.\n\nA. Immediately prior to becoming an MLA I worked as a production manager for five years at (the now closed) Simms and Young.\n\nBefore that I worked for different manufacturing companies in production management.\n\nQ. You became involved in politics at university, joined the Young Unionists and served as secretary of the Ulster Young Unionist Council (UYUC). You were also constituency secretary at your local UUP branch. Was your dad a major influence in your decision to enter politics?\n\nA. There was always some politics discussed over the kitchen table, although I was the only family member actively involved \u2013 I helped my dad put up posters at election time.\n\nAt university I took part in the Young Unionist protest march against the Anglo-Irish Agreement from Londonderry to Belfast.\n\nI never made any political ambitions for myself but I originally thought at some point that I might become a councillor.\n\nQ. If the Assembly collapses, what\u2019s next for you?\n\nA. More time farming and I\u2019ll look for an engineering management role.\n\nBelfast Telegraph"}, {"url": "https://www.roybeggs.co.uk/strong-work-ethic-of-former-uup-man/", "page_content": "Tributes have been paid to former Ulster Unionist Party leader Jim Molyneaux, who passed away on Monday, March 9 at the age of 94.\n\nLord Molyneaux, who served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War, was South Antrim MP from 1970 \u2013 1983 and later Lagan Valley MP from 1983 \u2013 1997. He was leader of the UUP from 1979 \u2013 1995.\n\nPaying tribute to Lord Molyneaux was East Antrim MLA, Roy Beggs Jr. \u201cWhen I served as the secretary of the Ulster Young Unionist Council in 1986/87, I got to know Jim Molyneaux,\u201d he said. \u201cI worked alongside Jim and had canvassed with him on a number of occasions. He had a strong work ethic in representing both his constituents and the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAside from serving as a Member of Parliament for many decades, Jim also served as a soldier in World War Two, and was one of the first to enter Bergen-Belsen.
