She passed away in 2017 at the age of 86.\n\n9. Connie Francis\n\nBorn Concetta \u201cConnie\u201d Rosemarie Franconero in New Jersey in 1937, Connie Francis began her music career during her teenage years, appearing for two years on NBC\u2019s \u201cStartime Kids.\u201d\n\nWhen she got into Arthur Godfrey\u2019s \u201cTalent Scouts,\u201d the host proposed a change to her last name to \u201cFrancis\u201d so that it was easier to pronounce.\n\nWhen Francis was 17, she signed with MGM Records and recorded her first single \u201cFreddy.\u201d However, this song along with all her eight solos were considered a commercial flop.\n\nIn 1957, she finally had her first success with her song \u201cThe Majesty of Love,\u201d which she performed together with American country singer Marvin Rainwater. The song was included in the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn 1958, Francis made another hit single \u201cWho\u2019s Sorry Now?\u201d this time ranking #4 in the US charts and #1 in the UK.\n\nShe stopped performing for a time following her sexual assault in 1974. She slowly recovered and was able to resume her career in 1989.\n\nFrancis continues to be fairly active in the music scene until today.\n\n10. Patsy Cline\n\nBorn in Virginia in 1932 as Virginia Patterson Hensley, Patsy Cline was a country music singer. She was also one of the first artists who successfully crossed over from country to pop music.\n\nWhen Cline was 15, her father deserted their family. This led to Cline singing in clubs in the evenings and working at a drugstore during the day to bring in money for the household.\n\nNot soon after, she began performing with Bill Peer\u2019s Melody Boys and Girls. At Peer\u2019s advice, she changed her stage name to Patsy Cline.\n\nCline soon signed with Four Star Records in 1954 and released her first single \u201cA Church, a Courtroom, Then Goodbye\u201d in 1955. The song was unfortunately not successful, but Cline continued to make several performances after that.\n\nShe caught her first huge break on Arthur Godfrey\u2019s \u201cTalent Scouts\u201d when she sang \u201cWalkin\u2019 After Midnight.\u201d The song peaked at #2 on the Billboard chart.\n\nIn 1960, Cline eventually left her first record company and signed with Decca Records. She released \u201cI Fall To Pieces\u201d and this song topped both the country and pop Billboard charts.\n\nA year later, Cline recorded her biggest top hit, \u201cCrazy.\u201d The song soon became the \u201cstandard\u201d for country music and remains to be one of the best country songs to this day.\n\nCline\u2019s rising career in the music industry was unfortunately cut short in 1963. She died in a plane crash during a flight from Kansas to Nashville. She was only 30 years old.\n\n11. Mindy Carson\n\nBorn in New York City in 1927, Mindy Carson was working as a secretary before she began her professional singing career. She debuted through a radio show with Paul Whiteman\u2019s Orchestra in 1946.\n\nCarson soon joined Harry Cool\u2019s band that same year. She proceeded to make several recordings with Cool, and of these songs were \u201cRumors are Flying.\u201d The song made it into the Top 20 on the US Billboard charts and helped Carson rise to fame.\n\nCarson sang mostly jazz songs, including \u201cWhen I Fall In Love,\u201d \u201cThe Touch Of Your Lips,\u201d \u201cWake The Town And Tell The People,\u201d and \u201cMy Foolish Heart.\u201d\n\nIn 1949, Carson received top billing at the prestigious Copacabana nightclub in New York City. She was the youngest performer to do so.\n\nCarson also recorded for RCA during that time, but after failing to hit the charts, they dropped her three years later in 1959.\n\nShe slowly faded from the music scene since then, but her legacy lives on despite her short career.\n\n12. Teresa Brewer\n\nBorn Theresa Veronica Breuer, she simplified the spelling of her name to Teresa Brewer when she started her professional singing career.\n\nBrewer was introduced to the music industry at a very early age. When she was five, she appeared on \u201cThe Major Bowes Amateur Hour\u201d and toured with them for about eight years.\n\nAt age 18, she signed with London Records and released her first single, \u201cWhen The Train Came In.\u201d It was not until her third single, however, that she topped the charts: \u201cMusic! Music! Music!\u201d was her first big hit, which stayed #1 for four weeks.\n\nHer rise to fame soon earned her a regular spot in \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show,\u201d and she was voted America\u2019s most popular female singer in the early \u201950s.\n\nIn 1951, she left her old label and switched to Coral Records. With Coral, she made a number of hits, including \u201cTill I Waltz Again with You,\u201d \u201cPledging My Love,\u201d and \u201cA Sweet Old Fashioned Girl.\u201d\n\nHer popularity waned after that, but she re-emerged as a jazz singer in the 1980s to the mid-1990s, produced by her husband, Bob Thiele. After Thiele\u2019s death in 1996, Brewer stopped recording altogether and retired from the music scene.\n\nShe passed away in 2007 at age 76 and left a legacy of about 600 recorded song titles.\n\n13. Debbie Reynolds\n\nBorn Mary Frances Reynolds in Texas in 1932, Debbie Reynolds was a woman of many talents: she was a singer, actress, and businesswoman.\n\nAt age 16, she was crowned Miss Burbank, and this brought her to the attention of talent scouts from MGM and Warner Brothers. She went to work with Warner Brothers, and at Jack L. Warner\u2019s suggestion, she adopted the stage name \u201cDebbie Reynolds.\u201d\n\nTwo years later, Reynolds eventually switched to MGM after Warner Brothers stopped producing musicals.\n\nDuring her time with MGM, she starred in several musical films, including \u201cSingin\u2019 In The Rain,\u201d \u201cBundle of Joy,\u201d and \u201cHow The West Was Won.\u201d The song she sang for the movie \u201cTwo Weeks With Love\u201d was the first film soundtrack that topped the charts.\n\nShe proceeded to create several hit songs for movies, and her song \u201cTammy\u201d for the 1957 film \u201cTammy And The Bachelor\u201d became a gold record.\n\nReynolds led a prolific career both in film and music. She remained to be a prominent part of the entertainment industry until her death in 2016. Reynolds died only a day after the death of her daughter, Carrie Fisher.\n\n14. Dinah Washington\n\nBorn Ruth Lee Jones in Alabama in 1924, Dinah Washington was considered as one of the most popular black female artists in the 1950s.\n\nAt 15 years old, she regularly performed as a singer to various Chicago nightclubs. She eventually changed her stage name to Dinah Washington at the suggestion of club owner Joe Sherman.\n\nDuring this time, American jazz musician Lionel Hampton was so impressed by Washington\u2019s performances at the club that he hired her as a vocalist in his band.\n\nNot soon after, Washington released her debut recording \u201cEvil Gal Blues,\u201d followed by \u201cSalty Papa Blues.\u201d Both songs made it to the Billboard \u201cHarlem Hit Parade.\u201d\n\nShe left Hampton\u2019s band in 1946 and pursued a solo career with Mercury Records. Her debut single with Mercury \u201cAin\u2019t Misbehavin'\u201d was the first of many of hits she would make.\n\nIn 1959, her rendition of \u201cWhat a Diff\u2019rence a Day Makes\u201d earned her a Grammy for the Best Rhythm & Blues Performance. Two of her other recordings also made it to the Grammy Hall of Fame: \u201cUnforgettable\u201d for the pop genre and \u201cTeach Me Tonight\u201d for R&B.\n\nUnfortunately, Washington fought depression much of her life, using retail therapy and prescription medications to cope. In 1963 at the age of 39, Washington died of an accidental drug overdose.\n\n15. Ruth Brown\n\nRuth Alston Weston, popularly known as Ruth Brown, was born in Virginia in 1928.\n\nRebelling against her father, Brown began her singing career at age 17 as a vocalist in nightclubs and USO shows. A local DJ recommended her to Altantic Records, but a car accident put her in the hospital for nine months, curtailing that.\n\nIn 1948, another talent agent from Atlantic Records scouted Brown, encouraging her to sing R&B. She released her first song \u201cSo Long\u201d in 1949, which quickly became a hit.\n\nA year later, Brown released another hit single \u201cTeardrops From My Eyes,\u201d which earned her the titles \u201cMiss Rhythm\u201d and \u201cQueen of R&B.\u201d\n\nAside from her contributions to R&B, Brown was also a key influence in the fight for musicians\u2019 rights for royalties. This eventually led to the founding of the independent non-profit organization Rhythm and Blues Foundation.\n\nIn the 1960s, however, Brown lay low with her career to focus on family life. She resumed her career in 1975 and starred in several films and Broadway shows, including the musical and cult classic \u201cHairspray.\u201d\n\nAfter a five-decade career, Brown passed away in 2006 at the age of 78.\n\nRelated: Our list of famous female singers of the 1970s.\n\nSumming Up the List The Greatest Female Singers of the 1950s\n\nThe music of the 1950s was poignant, with clarity and soul. These and other women singers of the period brought heart and emotion through song into the lives of many.\n\nWhether you prefer to listen to rock, country, jazz, rhythm, and blues, or show tunes, you can find someone in this list of singers that will tickle your fancy.\n\nCheck out their other songs, and you are bound to find something that will bring you delight!"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Huston/Films-of-the-1950s", "page_content": "Films of the 1950s of John Huston\n\nHuston thought of himself as a writer-director and almost always had a hand in the screenplays for his films, though he preferred working in collaboration with other writers. A lover of literature from the time he learned to read at age three, he drew the stories for his films primarily from novels and plays. The Asphalt Jungle (1950) was based on the hard-boiled crime novel of the same name by W.R. Burnett, who had provided the source novels for High Sierra and Mervyn LeRoy\u2019s Little Caesar (1931). Sam Jaffe, Sterling Hayden, and James Whitmore starred in that caper film noir as a gang plotting the multimillion-dollar robbery of a jewelry exchange. A thrilling exercise in fatalism, The Asphalt Jungle was one of Huston\u2019s most expertly structured films and earned him and cowriter Ben Maddow an Academy Award nomination for their screenplay.\n\nHuston was less fortunate with his 1951 adaptation of Stephen Crane\u2019s literary classic The Red Badge of Courage. Real-life World War II hero Audie Murphy starred in this story of a young Union soldier who deserts his company during the American Civil War. With the Korean War raging, MGM executives felt that the film\u2019s antiwar message was too blatant and cut The Red Badge of Courage down to 69 minutes. (The undoctored version was among Huston\u2019s favourites of his films.) Nevertheless, what remained, including some magnificently staged battle scenes, was impressive enough to have been called a minor masterpiece by Lillian Ross of The New Yorker magazine; she published the book Picture (1952), which chronicled the film\u2019s making.\n\nMuch of Huston\u2019s next film, The African Queen (1951), was shot on location in Uganda and Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Novelist and pioneering film critic James Agee worked with Huston on the adaptation of C.S. Forester\u2019s popular novel (as did the uncredited John Collier and Peter Viertel). The performances delivered by Bogart and Katharine Hepburn were among their most memorable, as drunken boat captain Charlie Allnut and as Rosie Sayer, the impossibly prim spinster who convinces him to take her on his rattletrap steamer down the Congo River to civilization at the outset of World War I. This splendid romance-comedy-adventure has remained one of the most popular Hollywood movies of all time. Huston was again nominated for Academy Awards for best director and best screenplay; Bogart won the award for best actor.\n\nIn 1952 Huston traveled to France to shoot Moulin Rouge (1952), a gorgeously mounted, sentimental biography of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (played Jos\u00e9 Ferrer), the crippled artist who became the toast of Montmartre for his lively artworks. Moulin Rouge was nominated for the Academy Award for best picture, and Huston was nominated for best director, the fourth time in five years that he had been nominated for that award. He would have to wait 33 years before the Academy nominated him again, as he entered the extended hit-or-miss phase of his career.\n\nWritten with Truman Capote and cofinanced by Bogart\u2019s Santana production company, Beat the Devil (1953) was filmed in Italy. A delightful spoof of The Maltese Falcon, it featured Bogart, Lorre, Jennifer Jones, Robert Morley, and Gina Lollobrigida as a motley shipboard assembly of adventurers, frauds, and con artists trying to locate a uranium mine while enduring a variety of comic disasters. Capote later said that they made up the story as they went along, an irreverent approach perhaps better suited to sensibilities in the 21st century than to those of the 1950s. Beat the Devil was a box-office disaster and precipitated a split between Bogart (who called the film \u201ca mess\u201d) and Huston after many years of fruitful collaboration.\n\nMoby Dick (1956), Huston\u2019s epic adaptation of Herman Melville\u2019s novel, was shot in Ireland, where Huston had gone to live in 1952, largely because he had become disgusted by the political climate of the United States during the McCarthy era. Although some critics found the stolid Gregory Peck badly suited to the role of the fiery, obsessed Captain Ahab, Huston and Ray Bradbury captured much of the poetry of Melville in their script, and the sea storm and whaling sequences were impressively staged. Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison (1957), a much quieter affair, starred Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr as a marine and a nun stranded on a Pacific island during World War II. Kerr received an Academy Award nomination for best actress, and Huston\u2019s and John Lee Mahin\u2019s screenplay was also nominated.\n\nHuston began working on David O. Selznick\u2019s remake of A Farewell to Arms (1957) but departed the production to instead direct the undistinguished period film The Barbarian and the Geisha (1958). Filmed in French Equatorial Africa with Errol Flynn and Trevor Howard, The Roots of Heaven (1958) followed and drew mixed reviews."}, {"url": "https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/famous-singers-of-the-1950s/", "page_content": "By Laura Macmillan\n\nThe 1950s was an influential period for several music genres, from rock and roll and classic pop to blues, doo-wop, and country.\n\nEven decades after their time, these singers inspire new artists and pique the curiosity of people interested in discovering vintage music.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019re going to dive into the decade as we take a look at 21 of the greatest and most famous singers of the 1950s whose music remains iconic to avid music lovers.\n\n1.

In 1945, she ran away from home to start her life as a nightclub performer with trumpeter Jimmy Brown, whom she would later marry.\n\nAfter a nine-month delay because of a car crash injury, Brown signed with Atlantic Records.

Johnny Burnette\n\nHailing from Memphis, Tennessee, Johnny Burnette was a rockabilly singer and songwriter. After giving up his professional boxing dreams, he, his brother Dorsey, and their old friend Paul Burlison formed a band in 1952, later renamed the Rock and Roll Trio.\n\nAfter the band disbanded in 1957, Burnette pursued a solo music career.

In 2000, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Despite his short-lived career, he played a significant role in rockabilly\u2019s rising popularity.\n\n19. Brook Benton\n\nBenjamin Franklin Peay\u2014better known as Brook Benton\u2014was born in Lugoff, South Carolina, in 1927. He was introduced to gospel music when he was young and started performing with several gospel groups in 1948. Benton also wrote songs for several music icons of the decade, including Nat King Cole.\n\nAlthough he released a few songs between 1955 and 1958, Benton made his mark on the music world in 1959 with his single \u201cIt\u2019s Just a Matter of Time.\u201d The song sold over a million copies and ranked first on Billboard\u2019s R&B chart and third on the Pop chart.\n\nBenton released a total of 38 singles during his career.\n\n20. Big Maybelle\n\nBorn Mabel Louise Smith, Big Maybelle was a popular rhythm and blues singer during the 1950s. Her stage name emphasized her bold, toned voice.\n\nAfter spending a few years performing with Dave Clark\u2019s Memphis Band and the all-female International Sweethearts of Rhythm, she recorded a few solo albums.\n\nIn 1953, she recorded \u201cGabbin\u2019 Blues\u201d for Okeh Records, which became a number-three hit on Billboard\u2018s R&B chart.\n\nHer 1956 hit, \u201cCandy,\u201d placed 11th on their list and received a Grammy Hall of Fame Award in 1999, 27 years after her death. She also performed at the Apollo Theater and the Newport Jazz Festival.\n\n21. Faye Adams\n\nLastly we have Faye Adams, later known as Atomic Adams. She was an influential rhythm and blues singer born in 1922. Her father was a gospel singer, and she began singing when she was five.\n\nHer career took off during the early 1950s after performing at several New York nightclubs. Popular singer Ruth Brown got Adams an audition with Joe Morris\u2019s band. After that, she got her contract with Herald Records in 1953.\n\nShe recorded the song \u201cShake A Hand\u201d in 1953, which sold one million copies and topped the US Billboard\u2019s R&B charts for ten weeks. In 1963, she retired from the music industry after recording for smaller record labels.\n\nSumming Up Our List Of Famous 1950s Singers\n\nThe 1950s\u2019 music was very influential amongst the public as new styles developed throughout the years. No matter which genre you prefer, you\u2019re bound to find a singer whose style will resonate with you.\n\nIf any of our list\u2019s choices interest you, feel free to add their top hits to your online playlists to give your life a bit more musical flair.

Choose your plan ArrowRight The arts center\u2019s got the warhorse right here, with a posse of polished riders for this musical based on Damon Runyon\u2019s New York yarns: Jessie Mueller as Miss Adelaide, the showgirl who wants to hear wedding bells; James Monroe Iglehart as Nathan Detroit, her hard-luck eternal fiance; Phillipa Soo as Salvation Army soul-saver Sarah Brown and Steven Pasquale as dashing, high-rolling Sky Masterson. The caliber of its above-the-title stars, announced by the center Tuesday, makes especially noteworthy the first show in the series since the pre-pandemic \u201cNext to Normal\u201d in January 2020.\n\nThe evolution of the musicals-in-concert series \u2014 which later in the season includes revivals of \u201cSunset Boulevard,\u201d with Stephanie Block as Norma Desmond, and \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d \u2014 continues, too. By agreement with Actors\u2019 Equity, the union representing professional actors and stage managers, the number of performances for each production has been increased, from eight to 10, and some staging restrictions relaxed. No longer, Kennedy Center officials say, will any of the actors carry their scripts onstage, a practice that was a concession to short rehearsal periods but that over time has proved an encumbrance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe changes will permit more ambitious stagings and more complete choreography, according to Jeffrey Finn, the center\u2019s vice president and executive producer of theater, who created Broadway Center Stage. \u201cThese will be much fuller productions,\u201d Finn explained. \u201cThat said, I still want to showcase the musicians onstage like we always have in the past. I feel like that\u2019s an exciting part of what Center Stage is.\u201d (Upward of 30 orchestra members will be used for \u201cGuys and Dolls.\u201d)\n\nBeginning in February 2018 with a reworked version of the musical \u201cChess\u201d with Raul Esparza and Karen Olivo (who now goes by KO), the series has become a magnet for musical theater lovers as well as for marquee-name actors and directors attracted by the short commitment. From first rehearsal to final performance, the job requires only a month. \u201cGetting in and out quick is one of the things that I love to do,\u201d Iglehart said in a phone interview, noting that he is one of the founding members of the popular hip-hop improv troupe, \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme.\u201d\n\nIglehart, who won a Tony for \u201cAladdin\u201d and who emceed the February concert celebrating 50 years of Broadway musicals at the Kennedy Center, is now part of the talent network Finn has been building. Mueller, a Tony winner for \u201cBeautiful: The Carol King Musical,\u201d played Marian the librarian in the Center Stage revival of \u201cThe Music Man\u201d in 2019, a production with Norm Lewis as Prof. Harold Hill that in my estimation was superior to the current Broadway version with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster.\n\nSoo, who is playing Cinderella in Broadway\u2019s \u201cInto the Woods,\u201d is married to Pasquale, who recently portrayed John Wilkes Booth in an off-Broadway revival of \u201cAssassins.\u201d \u201cGuys and Dolls\u201d is the first time as a married couple they\u2019ll be together in a show.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe concert format\u2019s advantages \u2014 including economy and emphasis on words and music over lavish sets \u2014 have been evidenced numerous times. John Kander, Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse\u2019s \u201cChicago\u201d started at the Encores series in New York in 1996 and has played more than 10,000 Broadway performances. Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine\u2019s \u201cInto the Woods\u201d was staged by director Lear deBessonet earlier this year at the Encores home base at City Center before moving on to the St. James Theatre, where it will now run through Oct. 16.\n\nNo Broadway Center Stage production has yet moved on from the Kennedy Center\u2019s Eisenhower Theater, where \u201cGuys and Dolls\u201d will run from Oct. 7 to 16. Finn, though, has that aspiration in mind. The Kennedy Center production of \u201cChess,\u201d for instance, was regarded as a test for a show with a great score (by Abba\u2019s Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, and Tim Rice) and a weak book, or libretto. And others, such as \u201cThe Who\u2019s Tommy\u201d in 2019, were conceived with such verve and freshness that a longer life somewhere else seemed possible.\n\nBut such wishes remain unfulfilled. \u201cI produce them first and foremost for the Kennedy Center and for our audiences,\u201d Finn said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that at the right moment, the stars will align to make a proper transfer happen. There just hasn\u2019t been that moment yet. But I\u2019m eager to have the stars align.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGuys and Dolls\u201d will be staged by Marc Bruni, who directed Mueller in both \u201cBeautiful\u201d and \u201cThe Music Man,\u201d and will feature music direction by Kevin Stites and choreography by Denis Jones. \u201cIt was the first musical that I saw on Broadway from the golden age,\u201d Bruni said, of a 1992 revival starring Nathan Lane and Faith Prince. \u201cI went on a school trip and went twice more to see it. I was so enamored with what musical comedy could do.\u201d\n\nFor Iglehart, getting his shot at Nathan Detroit adds a chapter to a family story. His father, he said in an interview, played Sky Masterson in high school in Oakland Calif., at a time when the production was segregated: Black and White students performed the show separately, Iglehart recalled.\n\n\u201cI always loved Frank Sinatra and I fell in love with Nathan Detroit,\u201d the actor said, referring to the 1955 movie version that also starred Vivian Blaine, Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando. He sang music from \u201cGuys and Dolls\u201d in his own high school show choir in Hayward, Calif., and played one of Nathan\u2019s sidekicks, Benny Southstreet, in a Bay Area community theater production.\n\nIt seems apt that Iglehart won his Tony playing the genie in \u201cAladdin.\u201d Because he\u2019s surely now been granted one of his own three wishes.\n\nGuys and Dolls tickets are available now for purchase by Kennedy Center members, and go on sale to the general public Thursday. 202-467-4600. kennedy-center.org.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"}, {"url": "https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/guys-and-dolls-1892", "page_content": "If I Were a Bell\n\nMy Time of Day\n\nI've Never Been in Love Before\n\nSky Masterson and Sarah Brown"}, {"url": "https://www.broadway.com/buzz/5767/how-guys-and-dolls-became-the-toast-of-the-town/", "page_content": "Decades before Times Square became the family-friendly tourist mecca it is today or the seedy wasteland it was in the 1970s, Depression-era Broadway attracted a mix of high and low, socialites and hell-raisers. Writer Damon Runyon found fame chronicling life in and around the Great White Way, and his humorous tales inspired one of the best Broadway musicals ever written:, now back on Broadway a year shy of its 60th anniversary.\n\nThe Boswell of Broadway\n\nDamon Runyon created a life for himself every bit as colorful as the characters in his columns and short stories. Born in Kansas in 1884, he grew up in Pueblo, Colorado, and learned the news trade from his father, an itinerant printer and publisher of small-town papers. The boy\u2019s mother had died when he was seven, and he was expelled from school in the sixth grade.\n\nAt 14, Runyon enlisted in the Army to fight the Spanish-American war and was sent to the Philippines, where he continued to write. A heavy drinker as a teen, he managed to give up alcohol completely by the time he arrived in the Big Apple in 1911 to cover sports for the New York American. Instead of booze, he chain-smoked and drank 40 cups of coffee a day.\n\nThe rough-and-tumble world of New York proved to be a perfect fit for Runyon, who became friends with the likes of Babe Ruth, Jack Dempsey and, later on, mobster Al Capone. Writing in a first-person, faux-formal style, he created characters with names like Madame La Gimp, Angie the Ox and the Lemon Drop Kid. Runyon was an enthusiastic gambler\u2014a horse race named in his honor is still run at Aqueduct\u2014and his hoodlums and chorus girls inspired an adjective still used to describe glamorous low-lifes: \u201cRunyonesque.\u201d As Jimmy Breslin noted in a not-so-flattering biography, Runyon \u201cmade gangsters so enjoyable that they could walk off a page and across a movie screen.\u201d\n\nEight years after being diagnosed with throat cancer, Damon Runyon died in 1946 and was memorialized in an uniquely New York fashion: His ashes were scattered over Broadway from a plane flown by World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker.\n\nOrigins of a Musical\n\n\u201cOf all the high players this country ever sees, there is no doubt but that the guy they call The Sky is the highest. In fact, the reason he is called The Sky is because he goes so high when it comes to betting on any proposition whatever. He will bet all he has, and nobody can bet any more than this.\u201d\n\nThus begins \u201cThe Idyll of Miss Sarah Brown,\u201d which formed the basis for Guys and Dolls. Actually, producers Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin didn\u2019t have a particular story in mind when they optioned Runyon\u2019s work\u2014they just thought the title Guys and Dolls would make a good musical. Later, they honed in on the tale of a beautiful Times Square mission worker named Sarah Brown who catches the eye of roguish gambler Obadiah \u201cThe Sky\u201d Masterson. Soon, the producers signed on Frank Loesser to composer the score.\n\nA native New Yorker, Loesser came from a family of classical musicians but was more interested in popular music; after a series of odd jobs, he began his career as a lyricist and songwriter in Hollywood, collaborating on such hits as \u201cHeart and Soul,\u201d \u201cTwo Sleepy People\u201d and the Oscar-winning \u201cBaby It\u2019s Cold Outside.\u201d \u201cFrank and I knew each other from the early days when we were broke, living on borrowed money,\u201d Feuer recalled in his rollicking memoir I\u2019ve Got the Show Right Here. After an early skirmish over securing Loesser\u2019s services for a film, Feuer writes that the composer \u201cstarted off by calling me a male genital organ, then a son of a bitch, and it went downhill from there\u2026Frank was a little guy, but he had commanding presence.\u201d\n\n\n\nBy the time Guys and Dolls came along, Loesser had successfully collaborated with Feuer and Martin on the musical Where\u2019s Charley? and quickly wrote his first Runyonesque song, the catchy \u201cFugue for Tinhorns.\u201d His score for Guys and Dolls mixed romantic songs like \u201cI\u2019ll Know\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Bell\u201d with a trio of classic comic numbers, \u201cTake Back Your Mink,\u201d \u201cA Bushel and a Peck\u201d and \u201cAdelaide\u2019s Lament,\u201d all involving Miss Adelaide, a nightclub engaged for 14 years to gambler Nathan Detroit.\n\nThe show\u2019s book was more problematic. Screenwriter Jo Swerling took a first crack, but according to Feuer, a falling-out happened when Swerling refused to incorporate a romantic wager; specifically, in Feuer\u2019s words: \u201cSky Masterson makes a bet that he can get into Sarah Brown\u2019s pants. That\u2019s how he gets all the gamblers to come to the mission! We loved it. Swerling was highly indignant.\u201d\n\n\n\nExit Swerling although forevermore he got first billing on the credits. Enter yet another New York native, Abe Burrows, a radio writer with a felicity for turning Runyon\u2019s convoluted turns of phrase into speakable dialogue. Coincidentally, Burrows appeared on a TV game show with George S. Kaufman, which helped attract Broadway\u2019s premier director to the new musical. Together, they honed the script, with one particularly descriptive line of dialogue, \u201cthe oldest established permanent floating crap game in New York,\u201d transformed into yet another memorable Loesser song.\n\nLuck Be a Lady\n\nThe four leads in Guys and Dolls\u2014Sarah, Sky, Nathan and Adelaide\u2014are now considered iconic musical roles, but only one of the original stars, Sam Levene, had ever appeared on Broadway. One was drawn from the movies Vivian Blaine as Adelaide, one came from burlesque Robert Alda as Sky, and one was a young British stage actress Isabel Bigley as Sarah. The producers looked for what Feuer called \u201cpeople with bumps,\u201d including many novice actors, to play the gamblers. Former longshoreman Tom Pedi played Harry the Horse, and a foul-mouthed comedian named B.S. Pully who brought his own dice to the audition was cast as Big Jule. During rehearsals, the short-tempered Loesser insisted that the actors sing at full volume at all times, even at the risk of blowing out their voices. In one infamous confrontation, Loesser slapped Isabel Bigley when her voice kept cracking on the difficult-to-sing \u201cI\u2019ll Know.\u201d As producer Ernest Martin told the story in Max Wilk\u2019s They\u2019re Playing Our Song, \u201c[Bigley] always broke somewhere in the middle of that range. She could never do it. Who the hell could? We\u2019re rehearsing it, and again she breaks. Frank walks up and gets up on the conductor\u2019s podium and he hits her. Boing! Right smack on the nose! So she stars to cry\u2026the only guy I ever saw punch a soprano in the nose. Took a swing at me once, too!\u201d A chastened Loesser immediately apologized and, according to Martin, bought his leading lady \u201ca bracelet that must have cost a thousand dollars.\u201d\n\nGuys and Dolls opened at the 46th Street Theatre now the Richard Rodgers on November 24, 1950. The audience response was so electric, Cy Feuer turned to his wife during the performance and said, \u201cThey were waiting for us.\u201d The show ran for three years, winning Tonys for Best Musical, for Alda and Bigley\u2019s performances, Michael Kidd\u2019s choreography and Kaufman\u2019s direction.\n\nRolling the Dice with Brando and Sinatra\n\nFilm producer Samuel Goldwyn paid a record $1 million for the movie rights to Guys and Dolls. When the stars he originally wanted\u2014Gene Kelly as Sky, Grace Kelly as Sarah and Betty Grable as Adelaide\u2014weren\u2019t available, the film\u2019s Oscar-winning screenwriter Joseph Mankiewicz pushed for Marlon Brando who had starred in his adaptation of Julius Caesar to play the smooth-talking gambler. British actress Jean Simmons was tapped as Sarah, and Vivian Blaine reprised her Broadway turn as Adelaide.\n\nAs for Nathan Detroit, Mankiewicz wanted original Broadway star Sam Levene, but Goldwyn insisted on giving the part to Frank Sinatra. What to do with America\u2019s most famous crooner in a part written to accommodate a comic actor who couldn\u2019t carry a tune? Simple: Write him a new song, \u201cAdelaide,\u201d one of three numbers added to the movie, along with \u201cA Woman in Love\u201d used during the scene in Cuba in which Sky and Sarah have their first date and a kitty-themed novelty number, \u201cPet Me Poppa,\u201d sung at Adelaide\u2019s Hot Box Club.\n\nFive songs were deleted from the Broadway score, including \u201cMy Time of Day\u201d Frank Loesser\u2019s favorite, according to commentary on the special edition DVD, \u201cMarry the Man Today,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve Never Been in Love Before,\u201d \u201cMore I Cannot Wish You\u201d and, most surprisingly, \u201cA Bushel and a Peck,\u201d which Sam Goldwyn didn\u2019t like. Presumably, \u201cPet Me Poppa\u201d was more his speed.\n\nReleased with great fanfare in 1955, the 150-minute-long movie version of Guys and Dolls preserves Michael Kidd\u2019s Broadway choreography in the crap game dance, Blaine\u2019s performance of \u201cAdelaide\u2019s Lament\u201d and \u201cSit Down, You\u2019re Rockin\u2019 the Boat,\u201d memorably performed by Stubby Kaye as Nicely-Nicely Johnson. As for Brando, what he lacked in singing ability, he made up for in sex appeal. Kidd kindly opined that the future Godfather \u201cmoved beautifully.\u201d\n\nThe Sky's the Limit\n\nIn the 40 years since Frank Loesser died of cancer at age 59, his most popular show has gotten three Broadway revivals and two major mountings in London. An African-American Guys and Dolls led by Robert Guillaume as Nathan enjoyed a six-month Broadway run in 1976. But it was Jerry Zaks\u2019 glitzy 1992 production\u2014and the rave it got from New York Times critic Frank Rich, with a front page production photo\u2014that reminded the world just how good Guys and Dolls really is.\n\nHeadlined by Peter Gallagher as Nathan and Josie de Guzman as Sarah, the revival ran for three years and catapulted Nathan Lane and Faith Prince to stardom as Nathan and Adelaide. It won Tony Awards for Prince as well as for Best Revival, Best Director and Best Scenic Design Tony Walton. Ten years later, a major London revival starred Ewan McGregor as Sky, Jane Krakowski in an Olivier-winning performance as Adelaide, Jenna Russell as Sarah and Douglas Hodge as Nathan.\n\nNow a new quartet of stars are assuming the leads in Guys and Dolls: Oliver Platt and Lauren Graham will lock pre-marital horns as Nathan and Adelaide; Craig Bierko and Kate Jennings Grant will fall in love as Sky and Sarah. \u201cThey\u2019re like a dream come true,\u201d director Des McAnuff says of his cast. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason we\u2019re doing it\u2014Guys and Dolls is like Hamlet, a timeless story that speaks to all ages. All that\u2019s required is the actors to play these parts, and we\u2019ve found them.\u201d\n\n\n\nMcAnuff\u2014who achieved great success with his 1995 Broadway revival of Loesser\u2019s How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\u2014shies away from previewing his production, set to open on March 1 at the Nederlander Theatre, saying simply, \u201cI\u2019m paying attention to the short stories, and to Runyon himself. He created a mythic landscape, one in which it\u2019s very natural for people to break into song. Most importantly, Guys and Dolls is about two couples, and those couples represent all of us. It\u2019s impossible to follow this story without relating to it in a personal way.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.mtishows.com/guys-and-dolls", "page_content": "Considered by many to be the perfect musical comedy, Guys and Dolls ran for 1,200 performances when it opened on Broadway in 1950. It received nearly unanimous positive reviews from critics and won a bevy of awards, including Tony Awards, Drama Desks and Oliviers. Frequently revived, the show has been done with numerous all-star casts, including productions/concerts featuring Ewan McGregor, Jane Krakowski, Brian Stokes Mitchell and Jessica Biel.\n\nSet in Damon Runyon's mythical New York City, Guys and Dolls is an oddball romantic comedy. Gambler, Nathan Detroit, tries to find the cash to set up the biggest craps game in town while the authorities breathe down his neck; meanwhile, his girlfriend and nightclub performer, Adelaide, laments that they've been engaged for fourteen years. Nathan turns to fellow gambler, Sky Masterson, for the dough, and Sky ends up chasing the straight-laced missionary, Sarah Brown, as a result. Guys and Dolls takes us from the heart of Times Square to the cafes of Havana, Cuba, and even into the sewers of New York City, but eventually everyone ends up right where they belong.\n\nFrank Loesser's brassy, immortal score makes Guys and Dolls a crowd pleaser.

She also performed in nightclubs and, occasionally, on television and in film. As a recording artist, she is represented by a series of original Broadway cast albums for the most part, although she did make a few solo recordings.\n\nRivera was born Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero in Washington, D.C., on January 23, 1933. Her father, Pedro Julio Figueroa, was a clarinet and saxophone player who died when she was seven. Her mother, Katherine Anderson del Rivero, took a job at the Pentagon. Rivera began ballet lessons at the age of 11. Five years later, she auditioned successfully for the American School of Ballet, part of the New York City Ballet, and attended on a scholarship. She switched to the musical theater when she was cast in the chorus of the national tour of Call Me Madam. She then worked on Broadway as a replacement chorus member in Guys and Dolls and Can-Can. On February 28, 1955, she opened off-Broadway in Shoestring Revue, a show produced by Ben Bagley and featuring songs written by Lee Adams, Sheldon Harnick, Michael Stewart, and Charles Strouse, among others. (Later in her career, she participated in Bagley's series of \"revisited\" albums of obscure songs by famous theater songwriters, appearing on Kurt Weill Revisited and Leonard Bernstein Revisited.) Shoestring Revue ran 96 performances. Three months later, on May 26, 1955, she made her Broadway debut as a featured performer in the book musical Seventh Heaven, with a score by Victor Young and Stella Unger. It ran only 44 performances, but it was recorded for a cast album by Decca Records, giving Rivera her recording debut singing \"Camille, Collette, Fifi\" and \"Love, Love, Love.\"\n\nWithin a year, Rivera had her first successful Broadway musical, appearing in a featured role in Mr. Wonderful (March 22, 1956), a show built around its star, Sammy Davis, Jr., with songs written by Jerry Bock, Larry Holofcener, and George David Weiss. It ran 383 performances, and Decca released a cast album. She achieved stage stardom with her featured role as Anita in West Side Story (September 26, 1957), the modernized Romeo and Juliet story with music by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, including her big numbers, \"America\" and \"A Boy Like That.\" It ran 732 performances with a cast album released by Columbia Records. On December 1, 1957, she married actor/singer Tony Mordente, who also was appearing in West Side Story. Their daughter, Lisa Mordente, was born June 30, 1958. She became an actress. Rivera and Tony Mordente were divorced in 1966.\n\nRivera also appeared in the London production of West Side Story that opened December 12, 1958. She enjoyed her second consecutive Broadway hit appearing opposite Dick Van Dyke in Bye Bye Birdie (April 14, 1960), a musical satire based on Elvis Presley's departure for the Army with a book by Michael Stewart and songs by Charles Strouse and Lee Adams. It ran 607 performances, and Columbia released the cast album. Again, she opened the show in London, starting on June 15, 1961, and she appeared on the original London cast album released by Philips Records in the U.K. and by the Wing Records subsidiary of Mercury Records in the U.S.\n\nAfter her two big hits, Rivera hit bad luck with her next show, Zenda, a musical adaptation of The Prisoner of Zenda, in which she starred with Alfred Drake. It boasted songs by Vernon Duke and Martin Charnin, but it closed during its pre-Broadway tryout after opening in San Francisco on August 5, 1963. Nevertheless, one of the performances was recorded live, and a cast album was released eventually by Blue Pear Records. Rivera returned to New York, where she made a solo LP, And Now I Sing!, for the tiny Latin-oriented Seeco Records label and appeared in Wonderworld, a revue with music by Jule Styne, at the New York World's Fair, starting on April 7, 1964. By the fall, she had found another Broadway vehicle. Bajour (November 23, 1964) featured songs by Walter Marks, and Rivera starred opposite Herschel Bernardi. The show ran a respectable 218 performances, and Columbia issued a cast album.\n\nRivera signed a singles deal with Dot Records that resulted in a couple of 45s, \"Blue Is the Color\"/\"Come on Back\" in 1965 and \"Emptiness\"/\"Raining in My Heart\" in 1967, and accepted assignments touring in shows around the country, including the national tour of Sweet Charity, in which she starred, in 1967. She also appeared, albeit in a secondary role, in the film version of the musical, released in early 1969, and on the soundtrack album released by Decca. Later in the year, she was in another musical that turned out to be a non-starter, Meredith Willson's 1491 (October 28, 1969), which ran in Los Angeles, but did not go to Broadway. The early \u201870s brought more touring. But she was back in New York on March 11, 1973, to appear in the one-night benefit performance Sondheim: A Musical Tribute, reprising her performance of \"America,\" and it was recorded for a two-LP set released by Warner Bros. Records. In September 1973, she had her first regular role in a television sitcom, appearing for the third season of The New Dick Van Dyke Show and thus reuniting with her old partner from Bye Bye Birdie. But the show ran only another year, ending in September 1974.\n\nRivera returned to Broadway in her third major hit, Chicago (June 1, 1975), co-starring with Gwen Verdon in John Kander and Fred Ebb's satiric story of crime and celebrity, set in the 1920s. It ran 947 performances, and Arista Records released the cast album on which Rivera sang such songs as \"All That Jazz.\" After her run in the show ended, she had a small role in the disastrous 1978 movie musical Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Another misbegotten effort in which she was involved was a sequel to Bye Bye Birdie, Bring Back Birdie (March 5, 1981), again with the creative team of Michael Stewart, Lee Adams, and Charles Strouse, which managed a mere four performances on Broadway, although it was recorded for an album issued by Original Cast Records. Another failure, if not quite so bad, was Merlin (February 13, 1983), starring magician Doug Henning with music by Elmer Bernstein and Don Black. It ran 199 performances on Broadway, but went unrecorded.\n\nRivera's next musical was barely more successful in terms of performances, running 204, but it was better received. In The Rink (February 9, 1984), she played the mother of a character played by Liza Minnelli and earned a Tony Award for her trouble. Polydor Records released the cast album. Rivera was seriously injured in a car accident, but recovered in time to open in the revue Jerry's Girls (December 18, 1985), an anthology of the songs of Jerry Herman that ran 139 performances. She spent the rest of the 1980s working in nightclubs and touring, including a yearlong jaunt, 1988-1989, in Can-Can accompanied by the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes.\n\nRivera's fourth major musical success had a long gestation period. Kiss of the Spider Woman was based on Manuel Puig's novel, which also had been the source of director Hector Babenco's 1985 film, and concerned prisoners in a South American jail, one of whom dreams of a famous Hollywood star. The songs were by John Kander and Fred Ebb. A rocky pre-Broadway tryout in 1991 led to a 1992 production in Toronto, followed by a successful opening on October 20, 1992, in London. (There was a recording of the Toronto cast by First Night Records, and of the London cast by RCA Victor, both featuring Rivera.) The show finally opened on Broadway on May 3, 1993, for a run of 906 performances, and Rivera won her second Tony Award for it. She headed a national tour that ran two years. Thereafter, she performed with Carol Channing in a show called Broadway Legends and in a club act she called \"Chita All That Jazz.\" She also appeared in children's television, resulting in her participation on the TV soundtrack albums Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child and, later, Johnny and the Sprites. Her appearance in the televised concert My Favorite Broadway: The Love Songs in October 2000 led to her inclusion on a 2001 album and home video drawn from the show. She had a cameo in the 2002 film version of Chicago.\n\nShe returned to Broadway in a supporting role in a revival of Maury Yeston's Nine (April 10, 2003), an adaptation of the Federico Fellini film 8\u00bd that ran 283 performances, and was heard on the cast album released on the PS Classics label. Returning to club work, she dubbed her show \"And Now I Sing,\" after her \u201860s LP. She appeared on Broadway in her own show, Chita Rivera: The Dancer's Life, from December 11, 2005, to February 19, 2006, then took it on tour. She made another of her rare appearances in a feature film with Kalamazoo?, which opened in April 2006. On December 26, 2006, Masterworks Broadway, a division of Sony BMG, released the Rivera compilation album Legends of Broadway, featuring her performances of songs from the West Side Story, Bye Bye Birdie, Bajour, Chicago, and Kiss of the Spider Woman original Broadway cast albums. In the spring of 2008, she starred in a production of The Visit, a musical adaptation of the Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt play with songs by Kander and Ebb, at the Signature Theatre in Washington, D.C. Signing to the newly formed Yellow Sound Label, she recorded And Now I Swing, only her second solo album as such, featuring songs associated with her throughout her career along with standards. It was released October 13, 2009, in anticipation of a concert tour dubbed \"Chita Rivera: My Broadway\" set to begin in January 2010."}, {"url": "https://www.pbs.org/wnet/broadway/stars/chita-rivera/", "page_content": "A vivacious singer, dancer, and actress \u2014 an exciting and explosive performer \u2014 Rivera was born to Puerto Rican parents and grew up in the Bronx. She started dancing when she was seven, and from the age of 11, trained for a career in classical ballet. After studying at the New York City Ballet via a scholarship from choreographer George Balanchine, in 1952 she turned from classical dance and joined the chorus of \u201cCall Me Madam\u201d on Broadway. Further chorus work in \u201cGuys and Dolls\u201d and \u201cCan-Can\u201d was followed by appearances in \u201cShoestring Revue,\u201d \u201cSeventh Heaven,\u201d and \u201cMr. Wonderful\u201d (1956). She rocketed to stardom in 1957 as Anita in \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d and stopped the show nightly by singing and dancing herself into a frenzy to the whooping rhythms of \u201cAmerica.\u201d She caused even more of a sensation when \u201cWest Side Story\u201d opened in London on December 12, 1958; it is still regarded by many as the most exciting first night of the postwar years. Two years later she was back on Broadway as Dick Van Dyke\u2019s secretary Rose, in the first successful rock \u2018n\u2019 roll musical, \u201cBye Bye Birdie,\u201d and she re-created her role in London in the following year. A musical adaptation of \u201cThe Prisoner of Zenda\u201d (1963), in which she starred with Alfred Drake, folded before it reached New York, but a year later, Rivera was acclaimed for her role as a gypsy princess in \u201cBajour\u201d on Broadway.\n\nIn the late \u201960s, she toured in various productions including \u201cSweet Charity,\u201d and also appeared in the 1969 film version with Shirley MacLaine. After more national tours in the early \u201970s in musicals such as \u201cJacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris\u201d and \u201cKiss Me, Kate,\u201d in addition to several straight roles, she co-starred with Gwen Verdon in the \u201csinfully seductive\u201d \u201cChicago\u201d (1975). John Kander and Fred Ebb wrote the score, and they also devised and developed Chita Rivera\u2019s cabaret act, which included a number called \u201cLosing,\u201d a reference to the number of Tony Award nominations she had received. She gained one more nomination for her performance in \u201cBring Back Birdie\u201d (1981), which closed after only four nights, and \u201cMerlin\u201d (1983) was also unsuccessful. Rivera was finally awarded the coveted Tony Award \u2014 and a Drama Desk Award \u2014 when she co-starred with Liza Minnelli in \u201cThe Rink\u201d (1984), another of Kander and Ebb\u2019s projects. Shortly afterward, she was involved in a serious car accident that \u201cmangled my leg from the knee down.\u201d After having 12 bolts inserted in the bones, she was back on Broadway, along with Leslie Uggams, Dorothy Loudon, and others, in \u201cJerry\u2019s Girls,\u201d a tribute to the composer Jerry Herman. During the rest of the \u201980s, she performed in cabaret and continued to tour in America and other countries including the UK. In 198889, she joined the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes in a national tour of \u201cCan-Can\u201d that lasted for over a year. In 1991, she was inducted into New York\u2019s Theater Hall of Fame, along with Kander and Ebb. She was subsequently widely applauded \u2014 and won London Evening Standard and Tony awards \u2014 for her outstanding dual performance as the movie star Aurora and the Spider Woman in Kander and Ebb\u2019s musical \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman.\u201d After 749 performances in Toronto, London, and New York, in November 1994 she set out on the show\u2019s two-year road tour of North America.\n\nChita Rivera Key Shows \"Call Me Madam\"\n\n\"Bye Bye Birdie\"\n\n\"Can-Can\"\n\n\"Chicago\"\n\n\"Kiss of the Spider Woman\"\n\n\"Mr. Wonderful\"\n\n\"Nine\"\n\n\"West Side Story\" Related Artists Leonard Bernstein\n\nBob Fosse\n\nKander and Ebb\n\nMichael Kidd\n\nNathan Lane\n\nArthur Laurents\n\nBrian Stokes Mitchell\n\nJerry Orbach\n\nCole Porter\n\nHarold Prince\n\nJerome Robbins\n\nStephen Sondheim\n\nCharles Strouse\n\nGwen Verdon\n\nTony Walton\n\nHer outstanding contribution to the musical theater was recognized in the early \u201990s by the Drama Desk\u2019s Annual Achievement Award, and the first annual Bandai Musical Award for Excellence in Broadway Theater. While in Washington, DC during 1996 with \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman,\u201d she was presented with an honorary Gold Record by the Recording Industry Association of America for her contribution to American sound recording. In the late \u201990s, Rivera co-starred with Carol Channing on stage in \u201cBroadway Legends\u201d (\u201cTogether at Last!\u201d) and toured her own revue, \u201cChita & All That Jazz,\u201d through the U.S. regions. In June 1998, she also appeared in a unique reunion of \u201cSweet Charity\u201d at Avery Fisher Hall at New York\u2019s Lincoln Center, and in the following year starred as Roxie Hart in the Las Vegas production of \u201cChicago.\u201d She left that show after three months in order to play the same role in the hit West End version. Her subsequent work early in the new millennium included the part of the proverbial hooker with the heart of gold in Arthur Laurents\u2019 new play, \u201cVenecia,\u201d and a U.S. tour of the family musical, \u201cCasper.\u201d In February 2001, Rivera was honored by the Drama League in New York.\n\nSource: Biographical information provided by MUZE.

Thank you so much for seeing me today.\n\nRob: No, thank you.\n\nMUSIC\n\nTara: I\u2019m a massive musicals fan, so I was wondering if we could find out a bit more about musical theatre and then see if we could work our song, 'The Sound of Us', into more of a musical theatre style track.\n\nRob: Of course, yeah. I\u2019ve listened to the song and it\u2019s great.\n\nTara: Could you tell me, what is musical theatre?\n\nRob: Musical theatre is a big show, bringing together acting, dancing, singing, storytelling ultimately through song.\n\nTara: Could you tell me a bit about the different kinds of roles you can find in a musical theatre production?\n\nRob: Onstage, you have performers who will be singing, acting, dancing. Then you have the musicians who are normally underneath the stage, which is called \u2018the pit\u2019, and they will be performing the music for the performers. And then backstage, you\u2019ve got a lot of people who are really important to making the show run smoothly: wardrobe, wigs department, sound, lighting, directors, set designers, choreographers. There are a lot of people to make that all happen.\n\nTara: Can you tell me a bit more about your role?\n\nRob: Yeah. I work in a number of different capacities within music, one of which is musical director, which is basically the link between the performer and the musicians just to make sure that the musical side of things runs smoothly. And I also work as an arranger where you\u2019re taking existing music and you are writing for the instruments that are used in that production and you\u2019re making it suitable for that performance.\n\nTara: What type of music might you hear within musical theatre?\n\nRob: Absolutely everything. There\u2019s musicals with hip-hop in, with gospel, with soul, with Motown, with orchestral.\n\nTara: How might a song be arranged for a musical theatre production?\n\nRob: You might change the style of the song totally, where you take a rock song, for example, and you might turn it into a really pretty ballad. You could have a British pop song like your song, and you might turn it into a Latin number. Why don\u2019t we go and try your song round the piano?\n\nTara: Okay, yeah.\n\nRob: Great. So, one way we could try this is as a real kind of 1940s, 1950s Broadway style, which will bring real excitement and energy to the piece.\n\nTara: Okay, great. So, how should I sing it?\n\nRob: I think with an American twang, would be great.\n\nPIANO PLAYING\n\nTara: We build it up, we break it down.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not sure, you bring me round.\n\nRising up through the noise, I hear a new sound.\n\nI hear it loud and clear.\n\nThis is the sound of us.\n\nThat was so much fun, thank you.\n\nRob: You\u2019re welcome.\n\nTara: So just lastly, could you give us any sort of tips or advice for anyone wanting to get started in musical theatre?\n\nRob: I think it\u2019s really easy now to research musical theatre. There\u2019s loads of musical theatre music online. You can download that, you can stream that. There\u2019s plenty of stuff to listen to. You can go and watch shows, and also there are local amateur groups where they\u2019re performing shows really regularly and that\u2019s a really good way of learning more about musical theatre and what it brings.\n\nTara: Thank you so much, Rob!"}, {"url": "https://www.goodspeed.org/guys-and-dolls-cast-and-creative-team", "page_content": "\n\nNANCY ANDERSON* (Miss Adelaide) Broadway: A Class Act, Wonderful Town.
