{"David Collings is famous for his roles in television series such as Doctor Who, Blake's 7, The Professionals, Minder, and EastEnders.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/26/david-collings-obituary", "page_content": "After a spectacular start to his television career in the 1960s, when he played leading roles in two classics by Dostoevsky, the actor David Collings, who has died aged 79, became a cult favourite of sci-fi fans with weird appearances in UFO (produced by the Thunderbirds team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson), three Doctor Who sagas and the 1979 supernatural detective series Sapphire and Steel, co-starring Joanna Lumley and David McCallum.\n\nAlthough he started out on the stage, Collings did not consolidate his reputation there until completing more than a decade of television stardom, after which he was in a string of important roles for the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nAt the Open Air theatre in Regent\u2019s Park he was a genuinely funny Polonius opposite newcomer Damian Lewis\u2019s firebrand Hamlet in 1994, directed by Tim Pigott-Smith; he had first played a tetchy but benignly well-meaning Polonius for an RSC touring production with Philip Franks in 1987.\n\nCollings was a fine featured, red-haired actor with sensitive blue eyes who was equally good at playing neurotic and sweet-natured characters. On television he also ran a good line in eminent characters from history: Percy Grainger in Ken Russell\u2019s Song of Summer (1968), Sir Anthony Babington in Elizabeth R (1971), John Ruskin in The Love School (1975), William Wilberforce in The Fight Against Slavery (1975) and William Pitt in Prince Regent (1979).\n\nHe was born in Brighton, East Sussex, to George Collings, a greengrocer, and his wife, Lillian (nee Parsons). At Varndean grammar school he enjoyed acting but had no thoughts of setting out to be a professional actor and, on leaving, started work as a designer in lettering, inheriting that interest from his father, a keen artist. From 1960 he was happily involved in amateur dramatics for the Withdean Players and the Lewes Little theatre, but then was recommended by the actor Freda Dowie to the director David Scase, who had been appointed to run the Liverpool Rep.\n\nAfter six months in rep, Collings found himself pitched into television through another unsolicited recommendation, this time from the actor John Slater, who thought he might be suitable casting in a 1964 Play of the Week presentation of Crime and Punishment. Thus he found himself playing the impoverished tragic hero, Raskolnikov, murderer of an old pawnbroker, in a three-and-a-half hour existential epic alongside Steven Berkoff, Peter Bowles, Julia Foster and Sylvia Coleridge.\n\nFive years later, in 1969, he was in another mighty Dostoevsky production, a BBC version in six episodes of The Possessed, as the charismatic rabble-rouser Pyotr Verkhovensky, alongside Rosalie Crutchley, Joan Hickson and Angela Pleasence. In the same year he was the Clerk in a BBC adaptation in seven long episodes of Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, with Barbara Jefford as the Wife of Bath and Barry Linehan as the Miller.\n\nHe made a rare feature movie appearance as a lovable Bob Cratchit in the musical Scrooge (1970), with Albert Finney, in the same year as he was captured by aliens and imbued with superhuman powers in UFO. In Doctor Who he was an alien himself, in a rubber mask, with ideas of blowing up the Cybermen with a home-made rocket in 1975; a robot-phobic, Poul, in a 1977 narrative that found him crawling round the floor and sobbing; and in 1983, Peter Davison having succeeded Tom Baker in the title role, he was mistaken for the good doctor before mutating into a mutant with a wild spaghetti hairstyle.\n\nCollings as Bob Cratchit in the 1970 film Scrooge, with Frances Cuka as his wife. Photograph: Allstar/Waterbury\n\nPausing only to play Legolas in Lord of the Rings on BBC Radio 4 in 1981, and a guest appearance in the final wipe-out episode of Blake\u2019s 7, Collings joined the RSC for the first time as Newman Noggs in the 1985 revival of David Edgar\u2019s Nicholas Nickleby on tour and on Broadway. He also appeared in a star-studded chorus in the fine Don Taylor television script of Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus (1986), with Michael Pennington, Claire Bloom and John Gielgud.\n\nFor the RSC subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, he played Thomas Cranmer in Henry VIII, Baron de Charlus in Tennessee Williams\u2019s Camino Real, Count Lerma in Schiller\u2019s Don Carlos, Sir Politic Would-Be in Ben Jonson\u2019s Volpone, Cardinal Pandulph in King John and Sancho in Lope de Vega\u2019s Madness in Valencia. You could not devise a more varied roster of roles, but he discharged them all with a bitter charm and watchful, wary eye.\n\nIn this millennium, he played a neat double of Sir Henry Green and the Duke of Surrey in Kevin Spacey\u2019s Richard II (2005), directed by Trevor Nunn at the Old Vic, and graced a startling revival of Middleton and Rowley\u2019s Jacobean shocker The Changeling (2006) for Declan Donnellan\u2019s Cheek by Jowl company at the Barbican; the cast also included Will Keen, Olivia Williams and an unknown but tremendous Tom Hiddleston.\n\nA favourite \u201cjob\u201d was appearing with his son, Samuel, in Toby Frow\u2019s 1950s revival of Marlowe\u2019s Edward II at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, in 2011; he was old Mortimer and Matrevis while Sam doubled as the king\u2019s lover, Piers Gaveston, and his poker-wielding murderer, Lightborn.\n\nCollings was married firstly to Deirdre Bromfield, whom he met at the Lewes Little theatre, in 1962 (they divorced in 1975), and secondly to the actor Karen Archer in 1983, from whom he was separated, although they remained close friends. He is survived by Karen, by their children, Samuel and Eliza, his daughter, Kate, from his first marriage, and his sister, Nola. He was predeceased by Deirdre and two of their children, Matthew and Bethian."}, {"url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/05/18/david-collings-actor-made-name-science-fiction-series-doctor/", "page_content": "David Collings, who has died aged 79, was a Doctor Who fans\u2019 favourite after taking three roles in the classic television science fiction series; he first appeared as Vorus, power-mad leader of the guardians of the mines on Voga, the \u201cplanet of gold\u201d, in the 1975 adventure \u201cRevenge of the Cybermen\u201d, determined to blow up the Time Lord\u2019s enemies with his Skystriker rocket.\n\n\u201cI was a sort of scientist/politician packed into a rubber mask and thinking, \u2018Thank God they can\u2019t see what I look like!\u2019\u201d Collings told the writer Alan Stevens. \u201cIn the end, he gets to fire his big rocket but then dies in the process.\u201d\n\nThe actor was back two years later in \u201cThe Robots of Death\u201d, his thick mop of red hair clearly visible this time while wearing what he described as a \u201cvery butch\u201d costume.

He was 79.\n\nDavid Collings was an actor that was recognizable to many fans of cult British TV shows of the twentieth century. His many, many credits included Blake\u2019s 7, Sapphire and Steel and of course, Doctor Who.\n\nIf you\u2019ve watched much of the Classic Series, you\u2019ll likely have noticed that it had a habit of recasting actors in a variety of roles. Collings was one such actor, one who played three roles in the TV series: Vorus in Revenge of the Cybermen, Poul in The Robots of Death, and Mawdryn in Mawdryn Undead.\n\nOut of these three roles, it\u2019s his performance as Poul that stands out, due to the complexity of the character. Intelligent and highly observant, Poul is at first an ally to the Fourth Doctor and Leela. In fact, he\u2019s the closest thing they even have to an ally, at first. But over the course of the story, he starts to have a breakdown due to his deep fear of robots, and eventually snaps. Collings\u2019s performance of this complex character is one key reason why Poul was so memorable.\n\nBeyond the TV series\n\nOne of David Collings\u2019s final performances was as Poul in the second volume of The Robots, out later this year.Image Courtesy Big Finish Productions\n\nLike many other actors, David Collings\u2019s association with Doctor Who didn\u2019t simply end with the TV series. In 2002, he played Poul once more in the audio series Kaldor City by Magic Bullet Productions, this time going under the name of Paullus. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time that he\u2019d play the character.\n\nIn other audio series, he played the delightfully sinister villain Sanders in Series 2 of Jago & Litefoot, and was reunited with Tom Baker and Louise Jameson in the Fourth Doctor audio The King of Sontar, this time playing a new character called Rosato.\n\nMore than that, however: David Collings even once played the Doctor!

In the story featuring David Collings\u2019s Doctor \u2013 Full Fathom Five \u2013 we were given a deliciously dark take on our hero, one who went further than any we\u2019ve seen on TV. It\u2019s a great story in its own right, and well worth a listen.\n\nInterestingly, we\u2019ve yet to hear his final performance. A short while ago, it was announced that the second volume of Doctor Who audio spin-off The Robots would feature Pamela Salem and David Collings, once again playing their roles of Toos and Poul from The Robots of Death.
