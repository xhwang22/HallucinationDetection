Ever since the great Writer\u2019s Strike of 2007, so-called \u201cunscripted\u201d television has taken over, and it isn\u2019t showing any sign of stopping. One of the many popular genres in the field is the singing competition show. These are programs made to challenge people\u2019s skills at singing by diving into numerous styles and genres of music with the winner often taking home a ton of cash, recognition in the industry, and sometimes, a record contract.\n\nCompetition shows have been around forever with talent searching platforms like Star Search often focusing on music. While that show is certainly legendary, it wasn\u2019t 100% about the music, which is why this list is focused on only those competitive shows that center entirely on singing. Shows like American Idol and The Voice are obvious contenders, but there are other more amazing series out there you may not have seen!\n\nThere truly are tons of examples of this genre, many from the UK, but not all singing competition shows are as good as the tracks they produce. There\u2019s so much to choose from, but there are a few series that are considerably better than others thanks to the intense competition found in each episode. This list highlights the very best reality TV shows in the singing competition genre so don't forget to vote up your favorites. Then, check out shows about music that aren't competition shows - some of which feature faces you'll recognize from singing competitions."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/choi.jae-bong/2504579", "page_content": "Choi Jae-Bong\n\nspeed skater\n\nJune 19, 1980\n\nHe represented his country at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.

With only four episodes left to go, here are three things to look for in the last couple episodes of \u201cLawless Lawyer.\u201d\n\nSpoiler\n\nRecently, Bong Sang Pil (played by Lee Joon Gi) found out that the person who had given him the mysterious notebook was in fact Cha Moon Sook (played by Lee Hye Young). Meanwhile, it was revealed that Ahn Oh Joo (played by Choi Min Soo) had been the one who ordered Choi Dae Woong\u2019s (played by Ahn Nae Sang) murder. Ha Jae Yi\u2019s (played by Seo Ye Ji) mother No Hyun Joo (played by Baek Joo Hee) used her newly exposed existence to plan for the future and created hope. After Cha Moon Sook\u2019s big plan was revealed, Bong Sang Pil became even more determined, hinting at his big counterattack in the future.\n\n1. Bong Sang Pil vs. Cha Moon Sook, who will be the final winner of their war?\n\nEver since the beginning of the drama, Bong Sang Pil vowed to chase after evil and now, he appears to be planning on making his revenge even more fervent. With Cha Moon Sook\u2019s big picture revealed, Bong Sang Pil\u2019s response will be unpredictable. He has also not stopped his pursuit after revealing that Cha Moon Sook and Ahn Oh Joo were the true murderers behind his mother\u2019s death. Rather, he has strengthened his vow to chase after evil and has shown that he is currently planning a counterattack.\n\nA source from the production staff stated, \u201cCha Moon Sook\u2019s revealed greater plan and their determination to topple each other over will add even more energy to the drama.\u201d\n\n2. The seven\u2019s committee relationships becoming twisted amongst conspiracy and betrayal\n\nThe relationship between the seven-person committee has become quite complicated due to Cha Moon Sook\u2019s change of heart. New relationships have developed while their commitment on the front regarding Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae Yi has strengthened. However, since Cha Moon Sook was a key, explosive player in the committee, it is unknown how the other members will respond.\n\n3. No Hyun Joo\u2019s fate after revealing herself to Cha Moon Sook\n\nThroughout the drama, No Hyun Joo was merely Cha Moon Sook\u2019s chiropractor and spy into the law firm. However, when she decided she could no longer put her daughter Ha Jae Yi in danger, she persuaded Bong Sang Pil to break up with her. She even purposefully exposed herself to Cha Moon Sook and was kidnapped by his bodyguards. To top it off, Ha Jae Yi believes that Bong Sang Pil used her for her quest for revenge over her mother. However, their 18-year partnership has proven that they have become even stronger under adversary. It remains to be seen whether No Hyun Joo will be able to convince Cha Moon Sook of her identity and how Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae Yi will work together to overcome further obstacles.\n\nA source from the production staff stated, \u201cIf the beginning of the drama focused on the law firm\u2019s promise to pursue evil, then the end of the drama will show a new atmosphere and transformation. All of the characters\u2019 cards have been played, and Bong Sang Pil and Ha Jae Yi have become even closer.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawless Lawyer\u201d airs every Saturday and Sunday at 9 p.m. KST.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, watch the first episode below!\n\nSource (1)"}, {"url": "https://en.unionpedia.org/i/Choi_Jae-bong", "page_content": "Choi Jae-bong Choi Jae-bong (Korean: \ucd5c\uc7ac\ubd09, Hanja: \u5d14\u8ca1\u9cf3, born 19 June 1980) is a South Korean speed skater.
