At age 20, he went to New York City to work in the dry-goods business of Chambers, Heiser & Company.[1]\n\nMerchant-entrepreneur\n\nJohn DeWitt, a New York merchant, hired Lewis in 1851 to assist DeWitt's son-in-law, Lucius Allen, in running a wholesale supply house in Portland, a frontier settlement on the West Coast.[2] Portland, with a population of about 800, was in good position to trade via the Willamette and Columbia rivers and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and other ports and by land with an increasing number of pioneer farmers in the Willamette Valley.[3] Allen, a friend of Lewis, had tried and failed in 1850 to establish a Portland branch store, and DeWitt thought that the more experienced Lewis would be able to help. In 1883 after several setbacks, the two men opened their own business (independent of New York) in a rented store at Front and \"B\" (Burnside) streets. They specialized in dry goods and groceries, building customer loyalty by selling at a fixed price, extending credit to reliable customers, and offering free space in their safe for storage of their customers' gold.[2]\n\nBy 1860, Allen had moved to San Francisco, a seaport city about 600 miles (970 km) south of Portland, where the company bought most of its supplies. He became a silent partner, uninvolved in day-to-day management. By then the firm of Allen & Lewis had begun to focus on wholesale markets, and by 1880, it was one of the leading wholesale grocery firms on the West Coast.[2] Lewis and three contemporaries, Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, and Henry Failing, who arrived in Portland in 1851 and set up businesses along Front Street,[4] became \"merchant princes of the Northwest\".[5]\n\nWithin 10 years, this group of dedicated Front Street merchants and their families would dominate the economic, political and social life of Portland. All became warm and lasting friends with Ladd, the former teacher and railroad agent, first among equals... With Benjamin Stark and John H. Couch, who became Lewis's father-in-law, they formed Portland's earliest Establishment, one of merchant-entrepreneurs.[4]\n\nIn 1864, these four merchants and others formed the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee, to raise money to make the Willamette shipping channel more easily navigable. This led to a federally funded project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dredged the channel in 1866.[6] In 1891, Lewis was named to the original Port of Portland Commission, established by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to oversee the maritime commercial and shipping interests of the city.[7]\n\nWhen railroads began replacing steamships as a shipping method in the 1870s, Lewis, Ladd, Corbett, Failing, and Simeon Reed (a Portland transportation executive), became the five largest stockholders, aside from Henry Villard, in Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N).[8] In 1888, Lewis was part of a group that visited Villard in New York to negotiate favorable shipping rates on the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads, with which Villard and the OR&N had contracts affecting Portland.[9] Lewis's interest in Portland railroads extended to the Portland & Willamette Valley Railroad, of which he became a local director in 1885, and which was controlled and formally taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1890.[10]\n\nLewis and the other three pioneer merchants were among those in 1864 who formed the Mercantile Library Association (later renamed the Library Association of Portland) to establish a local subscription library. Roughly 30 years later, after a public library opened in Portland in 1891, members of the Cicero Lewis family were among its largest donors.[11] In 1885, Lewis was one of 15 men named to the Portland Water Committee, empowered by the state legislature to acquire and operate a municipal water system for the city.[12]\n\nFamily, other interests, death\n\nIn 1857 Lewis married Clementine Couch, daughter of John H. Couch, a sea captain and early Portland settler. Unlike many of his friends, Lewis developed few interests beyond his business. His only form of recreation was walking to work, and although he was a charter member of the Arlington Club and could have dined there, he usually walked home for lunch. Historian E. Kimbark MacColl writes that Lewis \"spent his life at his desk and never went out in the evening for entertainment or the theater... He was never known to have taken a pleasure trip, spending what remaining leisure time he had with his wife and 11 children.\"[13] Lewis died of a stroke in 1897 while walking back to work on a Saturday afternoon.[13]\n\nLewis was a member of the Episcopal Church[14] and a Mason.[15] He was one of the largest supporters of Good Samaritan Hospital and Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland.[13] After Lewis died, his wife funded a hospital addition named in his honor at Good Samaritan.[1]\n\nThe Lewis family lived in a house on Fourth and Everett streets until 1881, when they built a large house on a lot in the Couch tract in northwest Portland. The tract, consisting of half of the block between 19th and 20th streets and Everett and Flanders streets, was owned by Mary Couch, Clementine's sister, and was developed by other members of the Couch family.[n 1] The project consisted of four houses, each on a lot 100 feet (30 m) wide and 100 feet (30 m) long.[5] The Lewis property, facing 19th Street, included stables, a greenhouse, and a sweeping drive leading to a carriage porch. Their very large house was built in a stick style that was \"rather simple for its period\", but its interior featured tall windows, a massive staircase, front and rear parlors, a reception room with a marble fireplace, and tall mirrors in elaborate frames, as well as \"rare woods, marble mantels, brocaded walls [and] fine lighting fixtures\" throughout.[5] The four houses on the Couch tract were demolished in the 1960s.[5]\n\nNotes and references\n\nNotes\n\n^ avenues in the 21st century) are numbered in ascending order beginning west of Front Street (later named [16] Central Portland lies on the west side of a bend in the north-flowing Willamette River .

When Octavian and Antony reconciled, a centurion murdered Cicero on Antony\u2019s order. Cicero\u2019s head and hands were nailed to the rostra in the Roman Forum.\n\nIn his youth, Marcus Tullius Cicero was instructed by the famed rhetorician Molon of Rhodes. Molon did not stick to any one style, instead drifting between florid and concise language. Cicero perfected this methodology, relying on cadence, emotion, and the energy of his audience and interweaving references to literature, philosophy, and history.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero resented the political machinations of Julius Caesar , Pompey , and Marcus Licinius Crassus and initially refused to ally himself with them, even attempting to isolate Pompey from Caesar. However, he later committed himself publicly\u2014if not personally\u2014to their advancement before diminishing his political involvement during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.\n\nIn 63 BCE Marcus Tullius Cicero gave an impassioned oration to his fellow senators that charged Catiline with plotting to stage a violent coup. This so moved the Senate that they voted to implement martial law and execute the conspirators. Cicero was named pater patriae\u2014\u201cfather of the country\u201d\u2014for his service to the republic.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was a masterful orator known for his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in plebeians and patricians alike. Cicero\u2019s political career saw him as quaestor , praetor , consul , and proconsul , providing him with several opportunities to influence the trajectory of Rome and the Senate in the waning days of the republic.\n\nCicero , in full Marcus Tullius Cicero , (born 106 bce, Arpinum, Latium [now Arpino, Italy]\u2014died December 7, 43 bce, Formiae , Latium [now Formia]), Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who vainly tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic . His writings include books of rhetoric , orations, philosophical and political treatises , and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator and the innovator of what became known as Ciceronian rhetoric.\n\nIn the first of his consular speeches, he opposed the agrarian bill of Servilius Rullus, in the interest of the absent Pompey; but his chief concern was to discover and make public the seditious intentions of Catiline, who, defeated in 64, appeared again at the consular elections in 63 (over which Cicero presided, wearing armour beneath his toga). Catiline lost and planned to carry out armed uprisings in Italy and arson in Rome. Cicero had difficulty in persuading the Senate of the danger, but the \u201clast decree\u201d (Senatus consultum ultimum), something like a proclamation of martial law , was passed on October 22. On November 8, after escaping an attempt on his life, Cicero delivered the first speech against Catiline in the Senate, and Catiline left Rome that night. Evidence incriminating the conspirators was secured and, after a senatorial debate in which Cato the Younger spoke for execution and Julius Caesar against, they were executed on Cicero\u2019s responsibility. Cicero, announcing their death to the crowd with the single word vixerunt (\u201cthey are dead\u201d), received a tremendous ovation from all classes, which inspired his subsequent appeal in politics to concordia ordinum, \u201cconcord between the classes.\u201d He was hailed by Catulus as \u201cfather of his country.\u201d This was the climax of his career.\n\nCicero was the son of a wealthy family of Arpinum . Admirably educated in Rome and in Greece , he did military service in 89 under Pompeius Strabo (the father of the statesman and general Pompey ) and made his first appearance in the courts defending Publius Quinctius in 81. His brilliant defense, in 80 or early 79, of Sextus Roscius against a fabricated charge of parricide established his reputation at the bar, and he started his public career as quaestor (an office of financial administration) in western Sicily in 75.\n\nAlliance with the First Triumvirate\n\nAt the end of 60, Cicero declined Caesar\u2019s invitation to join the political alliance of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey, the so-called First Triumvirate, which he considered unconstitutional, and also Caesar\u2019s offer in 59 of a place on his staff in Gaul. When Publius Clodius, whom Cicero had antagonized by speaking and giving evidence against him when he was tried for profanity early in 61, became tribune in 58, Cicero was in danger, and in March, disappointed by Pompey\u2019s refusal to help him, he fled Rome. On the following day Clodius carried a bill forbidding the execution of a Roman citizen without trial. Clodius then carried through a second law, of doubtful legality, declaring Cicero an exile. Cicero went first to Thessalonica, in Macedonia, and then to Illyricum. In 57, thanks to the activity of Pompey and particularly the tribune Titus Annius Milo, he was recalled on August 4. Cicero landed at Brundisium (Brindisi) on that day and was acclaimed all along his route to Rome, where he arrived a month later.\n\nIn winter 57\u201356 Cicero attempted unsuccessfully to estrange Pompey from Caesar. Pompey disregarded Cicero\u2019s advice and renewed his compact with Caesar and Crassus at Luca in April 56. Cicero then agreed, under pressure from Pompey, to align himself with the three in politics, and he committed himself in writing to this effect (the \u201cpalinode\u201d). The speech De provinciis consularibus (On the Consular Provinces) marked his new alliance. He was obliged to accept a number of distasteful defenses, and he abandoned public life. In the next few years he completed the De oratore (55; On the Orator) and De republica (52; On the Republic) and began the De legibus (52; On Laws). In 52 he was delighted when Milo killed Clodius but failed disastrously in his defense of Milo (later written for publication, the Pro Milone, or For Milo).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The province had been expecting a Parthian invasion, but it never materialized, although Cicero did suppress some brigands on Mt. Amanus. The Senate granted a supplicatio (a period of public thanksgiving), although Cicero had hoped for a triumph, a processional return through the city, on his return to Rome. All admitted that he governed Cilicia with integrity.\n\nBy the time Cicero returned to Rome, Pompey and Caesar were struggling against each other for complete power. He was on the outskirts of Rome when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy in January 49. Cicero met Pompey outside Rome on January 17 and accepted a commission to supervise recruiting in Campania. He did not leave Italy with Pompey on March 17, however. His indecision was not discreditable, though his criticism of Pompey\u2019s strategy was inexpert. In an interview with Caesar on March 28, Cicero showed great courage in stating his own terms\u2014his intention of proposing in the Senate that Caesar should not pursue the war against Pompey any further\u2014though they were terms that Caesar could not possibly accept. Cicero disapproved of Caesar\u2019s dictatorship; yet he realized that in the succession of battles (which continued until 45) he would have been one of the first victims of Caesar\u2019s enemies, had they triumphed. This was his second period of intensive literary production, works of this period including the Brutus, Paradoxa Stoicorum (Paradoxes of the Stoics), and Orator (The Orator) in 46; De finibus (On the Supreme Good) in 45; and Tusculanae disputationes (Tusculan Disputations), De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), and De officiis (On Duties), finished after Caesar\u2019s murder, in 44."}], "Cicero Hunt Lewis was a member of the New York State Senate from 1856 to 1859.": [{"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/11544653", "page_content": "Cicero Hunt Lewis (1826\u20131897) was a prominent merchant and investor in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon during the second half of the 19th century. Born in New Jersey, Lewis and a friend, Lucius Allen, traveled across the continent in 1851 to open a dry goods and grocery store in what was then a frontier town of about 800 people living along the west bank of the Willamette River. By 1880, their firm, Allen & Lewis, had become one of the leading wholesale grocery companies on the West Coast.\n\nSupporting transportation projects that affected his business, he was a member of the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee in the 1860s, invested in the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company in the 1870s, and was appointed to the original Port of Portland Commission in the 1890s. He helped form a local subscription library in the 1860s, and he was named to the city's first water board in the 1880s.\n\nMarried to Clementine Couch, daughter of another prominent Portland pioneer, Lewis fathered 11 children and after 1881 lived in a large, elegantly furnished house within walking distance of his office. He spent most of his time at work or at home, and had few other interests aside from church and charitable donations. He died in 1897 while walking to work on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in 1826 in Cranbury, New Jersey, Lewis moved with his parents at age 13 to Newburgh, New York. At age 20, he went to New York City to work in the dry-goods business of Chambers, Heiser & Company.[1]\n\nMerchant-entrepreneur\n\nJohn DeWitt, a New York merchant, hired Lewis in 1851 to assist DeWitt's son-in-law, Lucius Allen, in running a wholesale supply house in Portland, a frontier settlement on the West Coast.[2] Portland, with a population of about 800, was in good position to trade via the Willamette and Columbia rivers and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and other ports and by land with an increasing number of pioneer farmers in the Willamette Valley.[3] Allen, a friend of Lewis, had tried and failed in 1850 to establish a Portland branch store, and DeWitt thought that the more experienced Lewis would be able to help. In 1883 after several setbacks, the two men opened their own business (independent of New York) in a rented store at Front and \"B\" (Burnside) streets. They specialized in dry goods and groceries, building customer loyalty by selling at a fixed price, extending credit to reliable customers, and offering free space in their safe for storage of their customers' gold.[2]\n\nBy 1860, Allen had moved to San Francisco, a seaport city about 600 miles (970 km) south of Portland, where the company bought most of its supplies. He became a silent partner, uninvolved in day-to-day management. By then the firm of Allen & Lewis had begun to focus on wholesale markets, and by 1880, it was one of the leading wholesale grocery firms on the West Coast.[2] Lewis and three contemporaries, Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, and Henry Failing, who arrived in Portland in 1851 and set up businesses along Front Street,[4] became \"merchant princes of the Northwest\".[5]\n\nWithin 10 years, this group of dedicated Front Street merchants and their families would dominate the economic, political and social life of Portland. All became warm and lasting friends with Ladd, the former teacher and railroad agent, first among equals... With Benjamin Stark and John H. Couch, who became Lewis's father-in-law, they formed Portland's earliest Establishment, one of merchant-entrepreneurs.[4]\n\nIn 1864, these four merchants and others formed the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee, to raise money to make the Willamette shipping channel more easily navigable. This led to a federally-funded project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dredged the channel in 1866.[6] In 1891, Lewis was named to the original Port of Portland Commission, established by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to oversee the maritime commercial and shipping interests of the city.[7]\n\nWhen railroads began replacing steamships as a shipping method in the 1870s, Lewis, Ladd, Corbett, Failing, and Simeon Reed (a Portland transportation executive), became the five largest stockholders, aside from Henry Villard, in Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N).[8] In 1888, Lewis was part of a group that visited Villard in New York to negotiate favorable shipping rates on the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads, with which Villard and the OR&N had contracts affecting Portland.[9] Lewis's interest in Portland railroads extended to the Portland & Willamette Valley Railroad, of which he became a local director in 1885, and which was controlled and formally taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1890.[10]\n\nLewis and the other three pioneer merchants were among those in 1864 who formed the Mercantile Library Association (later renamed the Library Association of Portland) to establish a local subscription library. Roughly 30 years later, after a public library opened in Portland in 1891, members of the Cicero Lewis family were among its largest donors.[11] In 1885, Lewis was one of 15 men named to the Portland Water Committee, empowered by the state legislature to acquire and operate a municipal water system for the city.[12]\n\nFamily, other interests, death\n\nIn 1857 Lewis married Clementine Couch, daughter of John H. Couch, a sea captain and early Portland settler. Unlike many of his friends, Lewis developed few interests beyond his business. His only form of recreation was walking to work, and although he was a charter member of the Arlington Club and could have dined there, he usually walked home for lunch. Historian E. Kimbark MacColl writes that Lewis \"spent his life at his desk and never went out in the evening for entertainment or the theater... He was never known to have taken a pleasure trip, spending what remaining leisure time he had with his wife and 11 children.\"[13] Lewis died of a stroke in 1897 while walking back to work on a Saturday afternoon.[13]\n\nLewis was a member of the Episcopal Church[14] and a Mason.[15] He was one of the largest supporters of Good Samaritan Hospital and Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland.[13] After Lewis died, his wife funded a hospital addition named in his honor at Good Samaritan.[1]\n\nThe Lewis family lived in a house on Fourth and Everett streets until 1881, when they built a large house on a lot in the Couch tract in northwest Portland. The tract, consisting of half of the block between 19th and 20th streets and Everett and Flanders streets, was owned by Mary Couch, Clementine's sister, and was developed by other members of the Couch family.[n 1] The project consisted of four houses, each on a lot 100 feet (30 m) wide and 100 feet (30 m) long.[5] The Lewis property, facing 19th Street, included stables, a greenhouse, and a sweeping drive leading to a carriage porch. Their very large house was built in a stick style that was \"rather simple for its period\", but its interior featured tall windows, a massive staircase, front and rear parlors, a reception room with a marble fireplace, and tall mirrors in elaborate frames, as well as \"rare woods, marble mantels, brocaded walls [and] fine lighting fixtures\" throughout.[5] The four houses on the Couch tract were demolished in the 1960s.[5]\n\nNotes and references\n\nNotes\n\n^ Central Portland lies on the west side of a bend in the north-flowing Willamette River.

Cicero perfected this methodology, relying on cadence, emotion, and the energy of his audience and interweaving references to literature, philosophy, and history.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero resented the political machinations of Julius Caesar , Pompey , and Marcus Licinius Crassus and initially refused to ally himself with them, even attempting to isolate Pompey from Caesar. However, he later committed himself publicly\u2014if not personally\u2014to their advancement before diminishing his political involvement during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.\n\nIn 63 BCE Marcus Tullius Cicero gave an impassioned oration to his fellow senators that charged Catiline with plotting to stage a violent coup. This so moved the Senate that they voted to implement martial law and execute the conspirators. Cicero was named pater patriae\u2014\u201cfather of the country\u201d\u2014for his service to the republic.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was a masterful orator known for his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in plebeians and patricians alike. Cicero\u2019s political career saw him as quaestor , praetor , consul , and proconsul , providing him with several opportunities to influence the trajectory of Rome and the Senate in the waning days of the republic.\n\nCicero , in full Marcus Tullius Cicero , (born 106 bce, Arpinum, Latium [now Arpino, Italy]\u2014died December 7, 43 bce, Formiae , Latium [now Formia]), Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who vainly tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic . His writings include books of rhetoric , orations, philosophical and political treatises , and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator and the innovator of what became known as Ciceronian rhetoric.\n\nIn the first of his consular speeches, he opposed the agrarian bill of Servilius Rullus, in the interest of the absent Pompey; but his chief concern was to discover and make public the seditious intentions of Catiline, who, defeated in 64, appeared again at the consular elections in 63 (over which Cicero presided, wearing armour beneath his toga). Catiline lost and planned to carry out armed uprisings in Italy and arson in Rome. Cicero had difficulty in persuading the Senate of the danger, but the \u201clast decree\u201d (Senatus consultum ultimum), something like a proclamation of martial law , was passed on October 22. On November 8, after escaping an attempt on his life, Cicero delivered the first speech against Catiline in the Senate, and Catiline left Rome that night. Evidence incriminating the conspirators was secured and, after a senatorial debate in which Cato the Younger spoke for execution and Julius Caesar against, they were executed on Cicero\u2019s responsibility. Cicero, announcing their death to the crowd with the single word vixerunt (\u201cthey are dead\u201d), received a tremendous ovation from all classes, which inspired his subsequent appeal in politics to concordia ordinum, \u201cconcord between the classes.\u201d He was hailed by Catulus as \u201cfather of his country.\u201d This was the climax of his career.\n\nCicero was the son of a wealthy family of Arpinum . Admirably educated in Rome and in Greece , he did military service in 89 under Pompeius Strabo (the father of the statesman and general Pompey ) and made his first appearance in the courts defending Publius Quinctius in 81. His brilliant defense, in 80 or early 79, of Sextus Roscius against a fabricated charge of parricide established his reputation at the bar, and he started his public career as quaestor (an office of financial administration) in western Sicily in 75.\n\nAlliance with the First Triumvirate\n\nAt the end of 60, Cicero declined Caesar\u2019s invitation to join the political alliance of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey, the so-called First Triumvirate, which he considered unconstitutional, and also Caesar\u2019s offer in 59 of a place on his staff in Gaul. When Publius Clodius, whom Cicero had antagonized by speaking and giving evidence against him when he was tried for profanity early in 61, became tribune in 58, Cicero was in danger, and in March, disappointed by Pompey\u2019s refusal to help him, he fled Rome. On the following day Clodius carried a bill forbidding the execution of a Roman citizen without trial. Clodius then carried through a second law, of doubtful legality, declaring Cicero an exile. Cicero went first to Thessalonica, in Macedonia, and then to Illyricum. In 57, thanks to the activity of Pompey and particularly the tribune Titus Annius Milo, he was recalled on August 4. Cicero landed at Brundisium (Brindisi) on that day and was acclaimed all along his route to Rome, where he arrived a month later.\n\nIn winter 57\u201356 Cicero attempted unsuccessfully to estrange Pompey from Caesar. Pompey disregarded Cicero\u2019s advice and renewed his compact with Caesar and Crassus at Luca in April 56. Cicero then agreed, under pressure from Pompey, to align himself with the three in politics, and he committed himself in writing to this effect (the \u201cpalinode\u201d). The speech De provinciis consularibus (On the Consular Provinces) marked his new alliance. He was obliged to accept a number of distasteful defenses, and he abandoned public life. In the next few years he completed the De oratore (55; On the Orator) and De republica (52; On the Republic) and began the De legibus (52; On Laws). In 52 he was delighted when Milo killed Clodius but failed disastrously in his defense of Milo (later written for publication, the Pro Milone, or For Milo).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The province had been expecting a Parthian invasion, but it never materialized, although Cicero did suppress some brigands on Mt. Amanus. The Senate granted a supplicatio (a period of public thanksgiving), although Cicero had hoped for a triumph, a processional return through the city, on his return to Rome. All admitted that he governed Cilicia with integrity.\n\nBy the time Cicero returned to Rome, Pompey and Caesar were struggling against each other for complete power. He was on the outskirts of Rome when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy in January 49. Cicero met Pompey outside Rome on January 17 and accepted a commission to supervise recruiting in Campania. He did not leave Italy with Pompey on March 17, however. His indecision was not discreditable, though his criticism of Pompey\u2019s strategy was inexpert. In an interview with Caesar on March 28, Cicero showed great courage in stating his own terms\u2014his intention of proposing in the Senate that Caesar should not pursue the war against Pompey any further\u2014though they were terms that Caesar could not possibly accept. Cicero disapproved of Caesar\u2019s dictatorship; yet he realized that in the succession of battles (which continued until 45) he would have been one of the first victims of Caesar\u2019s enemies, had they triumphed. This was his second period of intensive literary production, works of this period including the Brutus, Paradoxa Stoicorum (Paradoxes of the Stoics), and Orator (The Orator) in 46; De finibus (On the Supreme Good) in 45; and Tusculanae disputationes (Tusculan Disputations), De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), and De officiis (On Duties), finished after Caesar\u2019s murder, in 44."}, {"url": "https://www.nysenate.gov/Senate-History", "page_content": "From a Constitutional Perspective\n\nThe New York State Senate, under the State's first Constitution which was adopted in 1777, consisted of 24 members, elected from and by the freeholders of the state possessing one hundred pounds over and above all indebtedness. The members were apportioned among four great districts and were chosen for four-year terms, the length of the first term to be decided after the election, by lot, with the terms of six members expiring each year. An additional Senator was to be added to each district whenever it was shown, by a septennial census, that the number of electors within the district had increased one twenty-fourth. The maximum number to which the Senate could be increased was placed at 100. When, after the census of 1795, the number of Senators had been increased to 43, the rule was found to be unequal in its operation and, in 1801, the Constitution was amended fixing the number at 32.\n\nUnder the Constitution of 1821, the qualifications of both the Senators and the electors were liberalized. The number of Senators was continued at 32, but the number of great districts in the State was increased from four to eight. It provided that one Senator should be chosen from each district each year, with the length of the terms of the first again to be decided after the election, by lot. The two-year Senatorial term was established in 1846 when the Constitution of that year divided the State into 32 Senatorial districts and provided for the election of one Senator from each district. The Constitution of 1894 increased to 50 the number of Senatorial districts, and also provided for reapportionment by legislative determination. In 1907, the Legislature passed a reapportionment act increasing the number of Senate districts to 51. A redistricting act passed in 1916 was declared unconstitutional, but a similar measure, which continued the membership of the Senate at 51, was passed in 1917.\n\nAll efforts to enact reapportionment legislation after that date failed until 1943 when the Legislature passed and the Governor signed a proposal that increased the number of districts and the membership of the Senate to 56.The first Senate under this new law was chosen at the 1944 general election. A reapportionment law enacted in 1953, effective in the 1954 election, increased the membership to 58. In 1964, a new reapportionment law was enacted, increasing the Senate to a membership of 65. This law was in Federal and State courts several times after enactment, and the 1966 Senate was based on the act. Members served for one year pending enactment of a new plan, which was to meet the objections of all the courts. In 1966, a court-devised plan set up a Senate of 57 members who were elected in the 1966 general election for a two-year term. In December, 1971, at the first extraordinary session of the Legislature, the State law was amended, effective January 14, 1972, providing for a Senate of 60 members. The constitutionality of this act was sustained by the State Court of Appeals in December, 1972. In accordance with federally mandated guidelines on reapportionment, Chapter 455 of the Laws of 1982 increased the number of Senate members to 61 by creating an additional Senate District. In the 2002 reapportionment, the number of Senate members increased to 62 when another Senate District was added.\n\nBesides passing upon legislative proposals and constitutional amendments, the Senate confirms or rejects nominations made by the Governor for the filling of certain State and judicial offices. It also sits at times as a court of impeachment, and can be convened in extraordinary session to perform either of these latter functions. The Lieutenant Governor while not a member of the Senate, is its President and presiding officer but, by constitutional enactment, has only a casting vote therein. The Majority Leader is also the Temporary President, presides in the absence of the Lieutenant Governor and is next in line to the Lieutenant Governor in succession to the governorship."}]}
