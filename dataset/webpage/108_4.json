In 2012, she married English actor Jamie Bell, with whom she has one son. They separated in 2014.\n\nEarly life and family\n\nWood was born in Raleigh, North Carolina. Her father, Ira David Wood III, is a locally prominent actor, singer, theater director, and playwright; he is the Executive Director of a local regional theatre company called Theatre in the Park. Her mother, Sara Lynn Moore (b. March 6, 1958), is an actress, director, and acting coach. Wood's brother, Ira David Wood IV, is also an actor; she has two other brothers, Dana and Thomas, and a sister named Aden.

Subsequently, she played the Ghost of Christmas Past in several productions at the theater, and she later starred as Helen Keller alongside her mother (who played Anne Sullivan) in a production of The Miracle Worker, under her father's direction. Wood briefly attended Cary Elementary, a public school in Cary, North Carolina. She was subsequently home-schooled and received her high school diploma at age 15.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWood began dating British actor Jamie Bell in 2005 after they co-starred in the music video for Green Day's song \"Wake Me Up When September Ends.\" They got matching tattoos of each other's initials; in Wood's case, a \"J\" on her left ankle. After a year together, the relationship ended in 2006.[36] Wood later commented that, \"We had matching tattoos because we knew our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, we split. But I don't regret the tattoo. It reminds me of a great, great period in my life.\"\n\nIn January 2007, Wood's relationship with Marilyn Manson became public. The two met at a party at the Chateau Marmont Hotel; Wood has stated that she was attracted to Manson's frequent use of black eye liner and once described their relationship as \"healthy and loving\". Two portraits of Wood, painted by Manson, have been exhibited at the Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art. Wood is also the inspiration behind Manson's song \"Heart-Shaped Glasses\", and she appeared with Manson in the song's music video. Manson has said that Wood's appearance was the highest-paid music video role ever. The couple split in November 2008; according to Wood, they \"both decided to take some time apart so [they] could concentrate on work.\" They later re-united and it was reported in early January 2010 that the couple was engaged to be married. Wood and Manson ended their engagement in August 2010.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Wood was reported to have rekindled her relationship with Jamie Bell, five years after they first broke up. The couple married in a small ceremony on October 30, 2012. They have one son, born in July 2013. Wood had a natural home birth with her son, and publicly thanked Ricki Lake, creator of the documentary The Business of Being Born, for inspiring her decision. In May 2014, Wood and Bell announced that they had separated after 19 months of marriage.\n\nIn August 2012, Wood came out as bisexual via Twitter. Wood's mother is a convert to Judaism and Wood's father is Christian. In 2003, Wood described herself as Jewish. In 2012, she stated, \"I believe in God but I am not religious. I am spiritual.
