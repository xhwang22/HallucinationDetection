{"Steve Ridzik left Microsoft in 1997 to pursue his own entrepreneurial ventures.": [{"url": "https://www.wired.com/2009/08/dayintech-0806/", "page_content": "1997: Microsoft rescues one-time and future nemesis Apple with a $150 million investment that breathes new life into a struggling Silicon Alley icon.\n\nIn a remarkable feat of negotiating legerdemain, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs got needed cash \u2014 in return for non-voting shares \u2014 and an assurance that Microsoft would support Office for the Mac for five years. Apple agreed to drop a long-running lawsuit in which they alleged Microsoft copied the look and feel of the Mac OS for Windows and to make Internet Explorer the default browser on its computers \u2014 but not the only choice.\n\nMicrosoft got to look like a noble competitor, for a change, for what amounted to a rounding error on their annual revenues. Timing mattered: The company was in the midst of an image-tarnishing antitrust fight over its heavy-handed promotion of IE during the height of the browser wars with Netscape.\n\nThe Apple faithful had already been conditioned to expect the unexpected when Jobs was in the house. But this surprise announcement, at Macworld in Boston, was pure Jobs theater. And it came with an oddly juxtaposed (satellite!) video feed of then-Microsoft CEO Bill Gates piped into the auditorium, dwarfing Jobs on stage.\n\nThe imagery may have been unintentional but the metaphor was entirely accurate: Apple had a tiny share of the desktop computer market, had not yet revolutionized the music industry with the iPod and couldn't possibly dare to dream it would disrupt the smartphone market with the iPhone \u2014 because there was no such thing as a smartphone.\n\nAnd while the fanboys didn't exactly know what to make of the new friendship between the corporate equivalents of a mongoose and a cobra, their instinct was, of course, to be against it. As reported at the time by The Seattle Times, \"The unexpected revelation ... prompted gasps of disbelief and loud boos from the audience of thousands of Mac users and software developers.\""}, {"url": "https://pressbooks.lib.vt.edu/strategicmanagement/chapter/7-2-entrepreneurial-orientation/", "page_content": "7.2 Entrepreneurial Orientation\n\nA famous Nike slogan encourages people to \u201cjust do it!\u201d For people and organizations that have developed an entrepreneurial orientation (EO), \u201cjust do it!\u201d is a way of life. While often associated with starting new ventures, an EO can be very valuable to established organizations as well. Below we describe each of the three characteristics associated with an EO: innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk-taking.\n\nAn additional two characteristics were later added\u2014competitive aggressiveness and autonomy. However, these two dimensions of EO have been subject to much debate and are omitted for the purposes of this text.\n\nTable 7.1 Understanding Entrepreneurial Orientation Term Definition Example Innovativeness The tendency to pursue novel ideas, creative processes, and experimentation. 3M has built its business around its mission statement: to solve unsolved problems innovatively. 3M employs over 7,000 researchers and more than 118,000 patents as of 2019, adding more than 4,000 patents annually. 3M\u2019s innovativeness has led it to develop thousands of products (such as Post-it notes and Scotch tape) that are sold in almost 200 countries. Proactiveness The tendency to anticipate and act on future opportunities rather than rely solely on existing products and services. Proactive Communications Inc. lives up to its name by focusing on emerging and unusual opportunities. The firm embraces contracts in war zones and natural disaster areas that are often avoided by other telecommunications firms. Risk Taking The tendency to take bold actions rather than being cautious. Richard Brandson\u2019s launching of Virgin Galactic\u2014a company that plans to offer suborbital space flights to commercial passengers\u2014reflects his love of high-risk, high-reward ventures.\n\nThe Value of Thinking and Acting Entrepreneurially\n\nWhen asked to think of an entrepreneur, people typically offer examples such as Elon Musk, Oprah Winfrey, Jeff Bezos, Kylie Jenner, and Mark Zuckerberg \u2014individuals who have started their own successful businesses from the bottom up that generated a lasting impact on society. But entrepreneurial thinking and doing are not limited to those who begin in their garage with a new idea, financed by family members or personal savings. Some people in large organizations are filled with passion for a new idea, spend their time championing a new product or service, work with key players in the organization to build a constituency, and then find ways to acquire the needed resources to bring the idea to fruition.\n\nEntrepreneurship within an organization is called intrapreneurship. Companies often grow by offering new services or launching new products. Rather than acquire another company that provides that product or service, they develop it themselves. This is a method of strategy implementation called internal development. To maximize opportunities for intrapreneurship, companies need employees with a high entrepreneurial orientation.\n\nThinking and behaving entrepreneurially can help a person\u2019s career as well. Some enterprising individuals successfully navigate through the environments of their respective organizations and maximize their own career prospects by identifying and seizing new opportunities (Table 7.1) (Certo et al., 2009).\n\nSection Video The relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and organizational performance [01:02] The video for this lesson discusses the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and organizational performance. You can view this video here: https://youtu.be/Iru7IBqc3Vk.\n\nIn the 1730s, Richard Cantillon used the French term entrepreneur, or literally \u201cundertaker,\u201d referring to those who undertake self-employment while also accepting an uncertain return. In subsequent years, entrepreneurs have also been referred to as innovators of new ideas (Thomas Edison), individuals who find and promote new combinations of factors of production (Bill Gates\u2019 bundling of Microsoft\u2019s products), and those who exploit opportunistic ideas to expand small enterprises (Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook). The common elements of these conceptions of entrepreneurs are that they do something new and that some individuals can make something out of opportunities that others cannot.\n\nEntrepreneurial orientation (EO) is a key concept when executives are crafting strategies in the hopes of doing something new and exploiting opportunities that other organizations cannot exploit. EO refers to the processes, practices, and decision-making styles of organizations that act entrepreneurially (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Any organization\u2019s level of EO can be understood by examining how it stacks up relative to three dimensions: (1) innovativeness, (2) proactiveness, (3) and risk taking. These dimensions are also relevant to individuals.\n\nEntrepreneurial orientation (EO) is measured at both the organizational and the individual levels. The characteristics of an entrepreneurial company noted in Table 7.1 also apply to individuals. Those individuals who are less risk averse, innovative thinkers, and competitive tend to have a higher EO and greater success at starting a business. Online EO assessment tools exist for those wishing to determine their EO. It is important to note that EO is not only related to high tech start-ups. Starting a lawn care business or a beauty shop are very valid and necessary entrepreneurial ventures, and will have a better chance of success if an entrepreneur possesses a higher EO.\n\nInnovativeness\n\nInnovativeness is the tendency to pursue creativity and experimentation. Some innovations build on existing skills to create incremental improvements, while more radical innovations require brand-new skills and may make existing skills obsolete. Either way, innovativeness is aimed at developing new products, services, and processes. Those organizations that are successful in their innovation efforts tend to enjoy stronger performance than those that do not.\n\nKnown for efficient service, FedEx has introduced its Smart Package, which allows both shippers and recipients to monitor package location, temperature, and humidity. This type of innovation is a welcome addition to FedEx\u2019s lineup for those in the business of shipping delicate goods, such as human organs. How do firms generate these types of new ideas that meet customers\u2019 complex needs? Perennial innovators 3M and Google have found a few possible answers. 3M sends nine thousand of its technical personnel in thirty-four countries into customers\u2019 workplaces to experience firsthand the kinds of problems customers encounter each day. Google\u2019s two most popular features of its Gmail, thread sorting and unlimited e-mail archiving, were first suggested by an engineer who was fed up with his own e-mail woes. Both 3M and Google allow employees to use a portion of their work time on projects of their own choosing with the goal of creating new innovations for the company. This latter example illustrates how multiple EO dimensions\u2014in this case, autonomy and innovativeness\u2014can reinforce one another.\n\nProactiveness\n\nProactiveness is the tendency to anticipate and act on future needs rather than reacting to events after they unfold. A proactive organization is one that adopts an opportunity-seeking perspective. Such organizations act in advance of shifting market demand and are often either the first to enter new markets or \u201cfast followers\u201d that improve on the initial efforts of first movers.\n\nConsider Proactive Communications, an aptly named small firm in Killeen, Texas. From its beginnings in 2001, this firm has provided communications in hostile environments, such as Iraq and areas impacted by Hurricane Katrina. Being proactive in this case means being willing to don a military helmet or sleep outdoors\u2014activities often avoided by other telecommunications firms. By embracing opportunities that others fear, Proactive\u2019s executives have carved out a lucrative niche in a world that is technologically, environmentally, and politically turbulent (Choi, 2008).\n\nRisk Taking\n\nRisk taking refers to the tendency to engage in bold rather than cautious actions. Starbucks, for example, made a risky move when it introduced a new instant coffee called VIA Ready Brew. Instant coffee has long been viewed by many coffee drinkers as a bland drink, but Starbucks decided that the opportunity to distribute its product in a different format was worth the risk of associating its brand name with instant coffee.\n\nAlthough a common belief about entrepreneurs is that they are chronic risk takers, research suggests that entrepreneurs do not perceive their actions as risky; most take action only after using planning and forecasting to reduce uncertainty (Simon et al., 2000). However, uncertainty seldom can be fully eliminated. A few years ago, Jeroen van der Veer, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, entered a risky energy deal in Russia\u2019s Far East. At the time, van der Veer conceded that it was too early to know whether the move would be successful (Certo et al., 2008). Just six months later, however, customers in Japan, Korea, and the United States had purchased all the natural gas expected to be produced there for the next twenty years. If political instabilities in Russia and challenges in pipeline construction do not dampen returns, Shell stands to post a hefty profit from its 27.5% stake in the venture.\n\nBuilding an Entrepreneurial Orientation\n\nSteps can be taken by executives to develop a stronger entrepreneurial orientation throughout an organization and by individuals to become more entrepreneurial themselves. For executives, it is important to design organizational systems and policies to reflect the three dimensions of EO. As an example, how an organization\u2019s compensation systems encourage or discourage these dimensions should be considered. Is taking sensible risks rewarded through raises and bonuses, regardless of whether the risks pay off, for example, or does the compensation system penalize risk taking? Other organizational characteristics such as corporate debt level may influence EO. Do corporate debt levels help or impede innovativeness? Is debt structured in such a way as to encourage risk taking? These are key questions for executives to consider.\n\nExamination of some performance measures can assist executives in assessing EO within their organizations. To understand how the organization develops and reinforces autonomy, for example, top executives can administer employee satisfaction surveys and monitor employee turnover rates. Organizations that effectively develop autonomy should foster a work environment with high levels of employee satisfaction and low levels of turnover. Innovativeness can be gauged by considering how many new products or services the organization has developed in the last year and how many patents the firm has obtained.\n\nSimilarly, individuals should consider whether their attitudes and behaviors are consistent with the three dimensions of EO. Is an employee making decisions that focus on competitors? Does the employee provide executives with new ideas for products or processes that might create value for the organization? Is the employee making proactive as opposed to reactive decisions? Each of these questions will aid employees in understanding how they can help to support EO within their organizations.\n\nSection Video Entrepreneurial Orientation [02:39] The video for this lesson explains the importance of entrepreneurial orientation. You can view this video here: https://youtu.be/L6MqD5Hhs2U.\n\nKey Takeaway Building an entrepreneurial orientation can be valuable to organizations and individuals alike in identifying and seizing new opportunities. Entrepreneurial orientation consists of three dimensions: (1) innovativeness, (2) proactiveness, and (3) risk taking.\n\nExercises Can you name three firms that have suffered because of lack of an entrepreneurial orientation? Identify examples of each dimension of entrepreneurial orientation other than the examples offered in this section. How does developing an entrepreneurial orientation have implications for your future career choices? How could you apply the dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation to a job search?\n\nReferences\n\nCerto, S. T., Connelly, B., & Tihanyi, L. (2008). Managers and their not-so-rational decisions.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Gilead Sciences, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Whole Foods, and countless other innovative companies owe their early success in part to the capital and coaching provided by VCs. Venture capital has become an essential driver of economic value. Consider that in 2015 public companies that had received VC backing accounted for 20% of the market capitalization and 44% of the research and development spending of U.S. public companies.\n\nDespite all that, little is known about what VCs actually do and how they create value. To be sure, most of us have the broad sense that they fill a crucial market need by connecting entrepreneurs who have good ideas but no money with investors who have money but no ideas. But while the companies that VCs fund may make headlines and transform entire industries, venture capitalists themselves often prefer to remain in the background, shrouded in mystery.\n\nTo pull back the curtain, we recently surveyed the vast majority of leading VC firms. Specifically, we asked about how they source deals, select and structure investments, manage portfolio companies post-investment, organize themselves, and manage their relationships with limited partners (who provide the capital VCs invest). We received responses from almost 900 venture capitalists and followed up with several dozen interviews\u2014making our survey of VCs the most comprehensive to date.\n\nAbout the Research To solicit respondents to our survey, we used alumni databases from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Harvard Business School, and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. According to a study by Pitchbook, more than 40% of the VCs with MBAs graduated from one of those schools. We also tapped the Kauffman Fellows program\u2019s data on its VC alumni. The National Venture Capital Association generously gave us a list of its individual members. Finally, we used the contact information of VCs in the VentureSource database. We administered the survey between November 2015 and March 2016. The survey was fully confidential, and all the reported results are based on an aggregation of many responses to exclude the possibility of inferring any specific respondent\u2019s answers. However, the survey was not anonymous, and we matched the respondents with VentureSource and other data sources.\n\nOur findings are useful not just for entrepreneurs hoping to raise money. They also offer insights to educators training the next generation of founders and investors; leaders of existing companies seeking to emulate the VC process; policy makers trying to build start-up ecosystems; and university officials who hope to commercialize innovations developed in their schools.\n\nHunting for Deals\n\nThe first task a VC faces is connecting with start-ups that are looking for funding\u2014a process known in the industry as \u201cgenerating deal flow.\u201d Jim Breyer, the founder of Breyer Capital and the first VC investor in Facebook, believes high-quality deal flow is essential to strong returns. What\u2019s his primary source of leads? \u201cI\u2019ve found that the best deals often come from my network of trusted investors, entrepreneurs, and professors,\u201d he told us. \u201cMy peers and partners help me quickly sift through opportunities and prioritize those I should take seriously. Help from experts goes a long way in generating quantity and then narrowing down for quality.\u201d\n\nBreyer\u2019s approach is a common one. According to our survey, more than 30% of deals come from leads from VCs\u2019 former colleagues or work acquaintances. Other contacts also play a role: 20% of deals come from referrals by other investors, and 8% from referrals by existing portfolio companies. Only 10% result from cold email pitches by company management. But almost 30% are generated by VCs initiating contact with entrepreneurs. As Rick Heitzmann of FirstMark told us, \u201cWe believe that the best opportunities don\u2019t always walk into our office. We identify and research megatrends and proactively reach out to those entrepreneurs who share a vision of where the world is going.\u201d\n\nWhat these results reveal is just how difficult it can be for entrepreneurs who are not connected to the right social and professional circles to get funding. Few deals are produced by founders who beat a path to a VC\u2019s door without any connection. Some of the VC executives we interviewed acknowledged the downsides of this reality: that the need to be plugged into certain networks can disadvantage entrepreneurs who aren\u2019t white men. Nonetheless, many VCs felt the situation was improving. For instance, Theresia Gouw, an early investor in Trulia and a founding partner at Acrew Capital, told us, \u201cWhile historically there have been significant roadblocks for women and underrepresented minorities to break into these networks, the industry has begun to recognize the missed opportunities and talent these groups represent. Firms have prioritized diversifying their partnerships, and as a result these networks are becoming increasingly easier to penetrate.\u201d\n\nNarrowing the Funnel\n\nEven for entrepreneurs who do gain access to a VC, the odds of securing funding are exceedingly low. Our survey found that for each deal a VC firm eventually closes, the firm considers, on average, 101 opportunities. Twenty-eight of those opportunities will lead to a meeting with management; 10 will be reviewed at a partner meeting; 4.8 will proceed to due diligence; 1.7 will move on to the negotiation of a term sheet with the start-up; and only one will actually be funded. A typical deal takes 83 days to close, and firms reported spending an average of 118 hours on due diligence during that period, making calls to an average of 10 references.\n\nFew VCs use standard financial-analysis techniques to assess deals. The most commonly used metric is simply the cash returned from the deal as a multiple of the cash invested.\n\nThough VCs reject far more deals than they accept, they can be very aggressive when they spot a company they like. Vinod Khosla, a cofounder of Sun Microsystems and the founder of Khosla Ventures, told us that the power dynamic can quickly flip when VCs become excited about a start-up, particularly if it has offers from other firms. \u201cThe best start-ups with inspiring entrepreneurs have intense competition to fund them,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor VCs, having a clear message about what you will and will not do, how you provide real venture assistance, and how you approach bold visions is key to winning these types of opportunities. And they matter tremendously for fund returns.\u201d\n\nWhat factors do VCs consider as they go through the winnowing process? One framework suggests that VCs favor either the \u201cjockey\u201d or the \u201chorse.\u201d (The entrepreneurial team is the jockey, and the start-up\u2019s strategy and business model are the horse.) Our survey found that VCs believe both the jockey and the horse are necessary\u2014but ultimately deem the founding management team to be more critical. As the legendary VC investor Peter Thiel told us, \u201cWe live and die by our founders.\u201d\n\nIndeed, in our survey founders were cited the most frequently\u2014by 95% of VC firms\u2014as an important factor in decisions to pursue deals. The business model was cited as an important factor by 74% of firms, the market by 68%, and the industry by 31%.\n\nInterestingly, the company\u2019s valuation was only the fifth most-cited factor in decisions about which deals to pursue. Indeed, while CFOs of large companies generally use discounted cash flow (DCF) analyses to evaluate investment opportunities, few VCs use DCF or other standard financial-analysis techniques to assess deals. Instead, by far the most commonly used metric is cash-on-cash return or, equivalently, multiple of invested capital\u2014simply the cash returned from the investment as a multiple of the cash invested. The next most commonly used metric is the annualized internal rate of return (IRR) a deal generates. Almost none of the VCs adjusted their target returns for systematic (or market) risk\u2014a mainstay of MBA textbooks and a well-established practice of corporate decision-makers. Strikingly, 9% of the respondents in our survey did not use any quantitative deal-evaluation metric. Consistent with this, 20% of all VCs and 31% of early-stage VCs reported that they do not forecast company financials at all when they make an investment.\n\nPablo Boneu/BABEL \u2022 SP \u2022 NY\n\nWhat explains this disregard for traditional financial evaluation? VCs understand that their most successful M&A and IPO exits are the real driver of their returns. Although most investments yield very little, a successful exit can generate a 100-fold return. Because exits vary so much, VCs focus on finding companies that have the potential for big exits rather than on estimating near-term cash flows. As J.P. Gan of INCE Capital explained to us, \u201cSuccessful VC deals take a long time to develop, mature, and exit. We very much focus on potential return multiple rather than on NPV or IRR at the time of investment. IRR is only calculated after the fact, when there is an exit for our limited partners.\u201d\n\nAfter the Handshake\n\nTo aspiring entrepreneurs, the typical VC term sheet often seems to be written in a foreign language. Of course, it\u2019s critical for company founders to understand these contracts. They\u2019re designed to ensure that the entrepreneur will do very well financially if he or she performs but that investors can take control of the business if the entrepreneur doesn\u2019t deliver. Prior studies of VC investment terms show that VCs accomplish that through the careful allocation of cash flow rights (the financial upside that gives founders incentives to perform), control rights (the board and voting rights that allow VCs to intervene if needed), liquidation rights (the distribution of the payoff if the company flounders and has to be sold), and employment terms, particularly vesting (which gives entrepreneurs incentives both to perform and to stay at the company). In general, deals are structured so that entrepreneurs who hit specific milestones retain control and reap monetary rewards. If they miss those milestones, however, the VCs can bring in new management and change direction.\n\nLess is known, however, about which investment terms are most critical to VCs and how they make trade-offs among them. So in our survey we asked which ones they used and which ones they were willing to negotiate.\n\nWe asked VCs what contributed most to the success or failure of their portfolio companies. The management team was identified as the most important factor by far.\n\nThe VCs indicated that they were relatively inflexible on pro rata investment rights, liquidation preferences, and antidilution rights (which protect their potential economic upside) as well as on the vesting of the founders\u2019 equity, the company\u2019s valuation, and board control (which is often seen as the most important control mechanism). As one VC put it, pro rata rights, which allow VCs to acquire an additional stake in a company, were paramount because \u201cthe biggest source of our returns is our ability to double down on our winners.\u201d VCs were more flexible on the option pool, participation rights, investment amount, redemption rights, and, in particular, dividends. Many of those terms have a smaller effect on the potential returns of the VCs and hence are more likely to be negotiable.\n\nNonetheless, many VCs try not to focus too narrowly on financial terms during their courtship with start-ups\u2014and give equal emphasis to how the company fits into their portfolios and why their experience and expertise can help the founding management team. As Khosla explained to us, \u201cTo attract the best entrepreneurs, it\u2019s important to have a clear point of view beyond just making money. What are you as a venture firm trying to do, and does it align with what the entrepreneurs\u2019 vision is?\u201d\n\nFinding Alpha\n\nOnce VCs have put money into a company, they roll up their sleeves and become active advisers. VCs told us that they \u201cinteract substantially\u201d with 60% of their portfolio companies at least once a week and with 28% multiple times a week. They provide a large number of post-investment services: strategic guidance (given to 87% of their portfolio companies), connections to other investors (72%), connections to customers (69%), operational guidance (65%), help hiring board members (58%), and help hiring employees (46%). Intensive advisory activities are the main mechanism VCs use to add value to their portfolio companies. (Surveys reveal that this is also true for private equity investors.) Jon Callaghan of True Ventures says his firm believes that advisory services play such a crucial role in attracting the best entrepreneurs that it has spent 15 years and $10 million developing them. \u201cWe do this because we\u2019ve learned time and time again that the founders are key to building and leading the teams that create the biggest outcomes in venture capital,\u201d he notes.\n\nThe top VC funds make a spectacular amount of money. Yet a definitive explanation for how VCs deliver \u201calpha,\u201d or positive risk-adjusted returns, has yet to be articulated. We decided to ask the VCs directly\u2014having them assess the relative importance of deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment actions to the creation of value in their portfolios. A plurality reported that while all three were key, deal selection was the most critical.\n\nA Venture Capital Glossary Antidilution rights allow the number of shares that current investors hold to be adjusted if future financing rounds are done at a lower price than the current round. Liquidation rights ensure that if a company is sold, the venture capitalists get paid before the founders do. They typically guarantee the amount invested or some multiple of it (for example, double). Option pool refers to an amount of equity set aside for grants to compensate current and future employees of the start-up. Usually it\u2019s a percentage of the company\u2019s total value. Participation rights allow venture capitalists to get back the face value of their investment (or a multiple of it) and then to share in the value created above that level at the time of a company exit. Pro rata investment rights give venture capitalists the right to invest in a company\u2019s subsequent investment rounds and preserve their initial percentage of ownership. Redemption rights give venture capitalists the ability to return stock to the company\u2014that is, force it to pay back the amount of the investment.\n\nWe also asked VCs what contributed most to the success or failure of their portfolio companies. Again, the management team was identified as the most important factor by far. As Brian Jacobs, a cofounder of Emergence Capital, told us: \u201cI have never seen a venture success for which one person deserves all the credit. The winners always seem to be the founders who can build a kick-ass team.\u201d Other factors the VCs cited included timing, luck, technology, business model, and industry, which they rated roughly equal in importance. Perhaps surprisingly, they didn\u2019t cite their own contributions as a major source of success. These answers suggest that it is entrepreneurs rather than VCs who create the most value for start-ups. One VC executive put it this way: \u201cOur firm puts a huge amount of work into helping our companies\u2014everything from assisting with hiring to acting as the founder\u2019s psychologist. But in the end the real success or failure of a venture comes from the founders.\u201d\n\nThe VC Way\n\nTourists who drive along Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto\u2014the street where many of the leading multibillion-dollar venture capital funds are located\u2014are often shocked to find only small, conventionally designed offices set discreetly behind leafy trees. The modest offices only add to the air of mystery around how exactly these firms are structured and operate.\n\nIn our survey the average VC firm had just 14 employees and five senior investment professionals. This pocket-sized, flat structure allows for quick decision-making and action\u2014but perhaps fewer checks and balances.\n\nPablo Boneu/BABEL \u2022 SP \u2022 NY\n\nAlthough they worked more than traditional banking hours, most VCs in our survey reported that their workweek was by no means excessive. On average, they put 55 hours a week in on the job, spending 22 hours a week networking and sourcing deals and 18 hours working with portfolio companies. In a recent update to our survey, done during a peak of the Covid-19 pandemic, we found that while VCs\u2019 pace of investment had slowed slightly, venture capitalists were allocating their time in roughly the same way\u2014pursuing new deals, performing due diligence, closing new investments, and helping portfolio companies.\n\nFinally, we asked about their interactions with their limited partners. The majority said that they believed their investors cared more about absolute performance than about relative performance. Nevertheless, the vast majority (93%) of VCs said that they expected to beat the market on a relative basis. That optimism is understandable. As of June 2020 the VC funds raised from 2007 to 2016 in the Burgiss Manager Universe had outperformed the Russell 2000 (a small-cap index) by 7% a year, on average, and the S&P 500 by nearly 5% a year. Almost 75% of those funds had beaten the Russell 2000, and roughly 60% had beaten the S&P 500.\n\n. . .\n\nHow can these findings be used in practice? For academics, our results offer a good base from which to further explore the nature and relative importance of deal sourcing, deal selection, and post-investment support services.\n\nIn addition, the preeminence of the founding team in the minds of VCs points to a potentially fruitful area of research for academics: Are there experiences or attitudes that define the people likely to be successful founders?\n\nOur survey results also offer critical takeaways to entrepreneurs. Because VCs rely on their networks to source opportunities, entrepreneurs should research who belongs to a VC\u2019s network and try to get an introduction from someone in it. Because the management team weighs so heavily in investment decisions, entrepreneurs should think carefully about how to present themselves in the best possible light when they do meet a VC. Because VCs look at more than 100 opportunities for every one they invest in, entrepreneurs should be prepared to pitch to many VCs.\n\nAs noted earlier, entrepreneurs who are not plugged into venture networks may face hurdles. Those entrepreneurs may include not only founders of color and female company builders but also those who live in regions outside the traditional hubs of venture capital, such as Silicon Valley, London, Boston, and Beijing. Sarah Kunst, the managing director of Cleo Capital, noted that years of success funding entrepreneurs in VC hubs have made the barriers to entry even higher for nontraditional founders. \u201cOur networks are often a reflection of where we live and where we\u2019ve worked. When certain groups are consistently disenfranchised, there is a cumulative network debt that accrues that can\u2019t be quickly overcome,\u201d she said, adding that even minorities who live in VC hubs are at a disadvantage. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been underpromoted at every job you\u2019ve ever had, your title might be several levels below your work experience, and your peers might not be in C-suites where they could hire you or appoint you to boards. If you\u2019ve been underpaid, you may not have the free cash flow to join exclusive clubs or angel-invest, and those missed network nodes add up to incalculable losses in career and net worth.\u201d\n\nIt is incumbent upon educators, venture capitalists, and society at large to work to mitigate systemic financial discrimination and ensure that a broader pool of entrepreneurs receives funding and support. There are no easy answers, and research has pointed to a variety of frictions that exist in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. For our part, we hope our research can help entrepreneurs from all backgrounds successfully network with and pitch VCs by understanding the criteria they use to evaluate investments, how they spend their time, what they do on a day-to-day basis, and which factors are most critical in ensuring great returns.\n\nFinally, many corporations have started investment arms over the past decade to try to harness the potential of entrepreneurial activity, and they can learn from the practices of the VC industry. The critical role that the management team and deal sourcing play in determining the success of investments should inform whom they choose to fund\u2014and where and when. The many local policy makers who seek to build sustainable venture capital ecosystems to foster economic growth can likewise benefit from understanding VCs\u2019 tactics. The ability of government leaders and officials to promote high-quality, high-potential entrepreneurs should not be overlooked. Finally, universities are often the source of innovations that end up in the portfolios of VCs. University officials can learn how to better leverage the innovative activity happening within their halls. Building relationships with leading VCs and promoting an entrepreneurial community can help spur start-up activity."}, {"url": "https://hbr.org/2012/04/the-real-leadership-lessons-of-steve-jobs", "page_content": "His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents\u2019 garage in 1976, was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in October 2011, had built it into the world\u2019s most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven industries: personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital publishing. He thus belongs in the pantheon of America\u2019s great innovators, along with Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Walt Disney. None of these men was a saint, but long after their personalities are forgotten, history will remember how they applied imagination to technology and business.\n\n\u201cThe people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.\u201d \u2014Apple\u2019s \u201cThink Different\u201d commercial, 1997\n\nIn the months since my biography of Jobs came out, countless commentators have tried to draw management lessons from it. Some of those readers have been insightful, but I think that many of them (especially those with no experience in entrepreneurship) fixate too much on the rough edges of his personality. The essence of Jobs, I think, is that his personality was integral to his way of doing business. He acted as if the normal rules didn\u2019t apply to him, and the passion, intensity, and extreme emotionalism he brought to everyday life were things he also poured into the products he made. His petulance and impatience were part and parcel of his perfectionism.\n\nOne of the last times I saw him, after I had finished writing most of the book, I asked him again about his tendency to be rough on people. \u201cLook at the results,\u201d he replied. \u201cThese are all smart people I work with, and any of them could get a top job at another place if they were truly feeling brutalized. But they don\u2019t.\u201d Then he paused for a few moments and said, almost wistfully, \u201cAnd we got some amazing things done.\u201d Indeed, he and Apple had had a string of hits over the past dozen years that was greater than that of any other innovative company in modern times: iMac, iPod, iPod nano, iTunes Store, Apple Stores, MacBook, iPhone, iPad, App Store, OS X Lion\u2014not to mention every Pixar film. And as he battled his final illness, Jobs was surrounded by an intensely loyal cadre of colleagues who had been inspired by him for years and a very loving wife, sister, and four children.\n\nSo I think the real lessons from Steve Jobs have to be drawn from looking at what he actually accomplished. I once asked him what he thought was his most important creation, thinking he would answer the iPad or the Macintosh. Instead he said it was Apple the company. Making an enduring company, he said, was both far harder and more important than making a great product. How did he do it? Business schools will be studying that question a century from now. Here are what I consider the keys to his success.\n\nFocus\n\nWhen Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, it was producing a random array of computers and peripherals, including a dozen different versions of the Macintosh. After a few weeks of product review sessions, he\u2019d finally had enough. \u201cStop!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d He grabbed a Magic Marker, padded in his bare feet to a whiteboard, and drew a two-by-two grid. \u201cHere\u2019s what we need,\u201d he declared. Atop the two columns, he wrote \u201cConsumer\u201d and \u201cPro.\u201d He labeled the two rows \u201cDesktop\u201d and \u201cPortable.\u201d Their job, he told his team members, was to focus on four great products, one for each quadrant. All other products should be canceled. There was a stunned silence. But by getting Apple to focus on making just four computers, he saved the company. \u201cDeciding what not to do is as important as deciding what to do,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s true for companies, and it\u2019s true for products.\u201d\n\nAfter he righted the company, Jobs began taking his \u201ctop 100\u201d people on a retreat each year. On the last day, he would stand in front of a whiteboard (he loved whiteboards, because they gave him complete control of a situation and they engendered focus) and ask, \u201cWhat are the 10 things we should be doing next?\u201d People would fight to get their suggestions on the list. Jobs would write them down\u2014and then cross off the ones he decreed dumb. After much jockeying, the group would come up with a list of 10. Then Jobs would slash the bottom seven and announce, \u201cWe can only do three.\u201d\n\nFocus was ingrained in Jobs\u2019s personality and had been honed by his Zen training. He relentlessly filtered out what he considered distractions. Colleagues and family members would at times be exasperated as they tried to get him to deal with issues\u2014a legal problem, a medical diagnosis\u2014they considered important. But he would give a cold stare and refuse to shift his laserlike focus until he was ready.\n\nNear the end of his life, Jobs was visited at home by Larry Page, who was about to resume control of Google, the company he had cofounded. Even though their companies were feuding, Jobs was willing to give some advice. \u201cThe main thing I stressed was focus,\u201d he recalled. Figure out what Google wants to be when it grows up, he told Page. \u201cIt\u2019s now all over the map. What are the five products you want to focus on? Get rid of the rest, because they\u2019re dragging you down. They\u2019re turning you into Microsoft. They\u2019re causing you to turn out products that are adequate but not great.\u201d Page followed the advice. In January 2012 he told employees to focus on just a few priorities, such as Android and Google+, and to make them \u201cbeautiful,\u201d the way Jobs would have done.\n\nSimplify\n\nJobs\u2019s Zenlike ability to focus was accompanied by the related instinct to simplify things by zeroing in on their essence and eliminating unnecessary components. \u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication,\u201d declared Apple\u2019s first marketing brochure. To see what that means, compare any Apple software with, say, Microsoft Word, which keeps getting uglier and more cluttered with nonintuitive navigational ribbons and intrusive features. It is a reminder of the glory of Apple\u2019s quest for simplicity.\n\nJobs learned to admire simplicity when he was working the night shift at Atari as a college dropout. Atari\u2019s games came with no manual and needed to be uncomplicated enough that a stoned freshman could figure them out. The only instructions for its Star Trek game were: \u201c1. Insert quarter. 2. Avoid Klingons.\u201d His love of simplicity in design was refined at design conferences he attended at the Aspen Institute in the late 1970s on a campus built in the Bauhaus style, which emphasized clean lines and functional design devoid of frills or distractions.\n\nWhen Jobs visited Xerox\u2019s Palo Alto Research Center and saw the plans for a computer that had a graphical user interface and a mouse, he set about making the design both more intuitive (his team enabled the user to drag and drop documents and folders on a virtual desktop) and simpler. For example, the Xerox mouse had three buttons and cost $300; Jobs went to a local industrial design firm and told one of its founders, Dean Hovey, that he wanted a simple, single-button model that cost $15. Hovey complied.\n\nJobs aimed for the simplicity that comes from conquering, rather than merely ignoring, complexity. Achieving this depth of simplicity, he realized, would produce a machine that felt as if it deferred to users in a friendly way, rather than challenging them. \u201cIt takes a lot of hard work,\u201d he said, \u201cto make something simple, to truly understand the underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.\u201d\n\nIn Jony Ive, Apple\u2019s industrial designer, Jobs met his soul mate in the quest for deep rather than superficial simplicity. They knew that simplicity is not merely a minimalist style or the removal of clutter. In order to eliminate screws, buttons, or excess navigational screens, it was necessary to understand profoundly the role each element played. \u201cTo be truly simple, you have to go really deep,\u201d Ive explained. \u201cFor example, to have no screws on something, you can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity, to understand everything about it and how it\u2019s manufactured.\u201d\n\nDuring the design of the iPod interface, Jobs tried at every meeting to find ways to cut clutter. He insisted on being able to get to whatever he wanted in three clicks. One navigation screen, for example, asked users whether they wanted to search by song, album, or artist. \u201cWhy do we need that screen?\u201d Jobs demanded. The designers realized they didn\u2019t. \u201cThere would be times when we\u2019d rack our brains on a user interface problem, and he would go, \u2018Did you think of this?\u2019\u201d says Tony Fadell, who led the iPod team. \u201cAnd then we\u2019d all go, \u2018Holy shit.\u2019 He\u2019d redefine the problem or approach, and our little problem would go away.\u201d At one point Jobs made the simplest of all suggestions: Let\u2019s get rid of the on/off button. At first the team members were taken aback, but then they realized the button was unnecessary. The device would gradually power down if it wasn\u2019t being used and would spring to life when reengaged.\n\nLikewise, when Jobs was shown a cluttered set of proposed navigation screens for iDVD, which allowed users to burn video onto a disk, he jumped up and drew a simple rectangle on a whiteboard. \u201cHere\u2019s the new application,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got one window. You drag your video into the window. Then you click the button that says \u2018Burn.\u2019 That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to make.\u201d\n\nIn looking for industries or categories ripe for disruption, Jobs always asked who was making products more complicated than they should be. In 2001 portable music players and ways to acquire songs online fit that description, leading to the iPod and the iTunes Store. Mobile phones were next. Jobs would grab a phone at a meeting and rant (correctly) that nobody could possibly figure out how to navigate half the features, including the address book. At the end of his career he was setting his sights on the television industry, which had made it almost impossible for people to click on a simple device to watch what they wanted when they wanted.\n\nTake Responsibility End to End\n\nJobs knew that the best way to achieve simplicity was to make sure that hardware, software, and peripheral devices were seamlessly integrated. An Apple ecosystem\u2014an iPod connected to a Mac with iTunes software, for example\u2014allowed devices to be simpler, syncing to be smoother, and glitches to be rarer. The more complex tasks, such as making new playlists, could be done on the computer, allowing the iPod to have fewer functions and buttons.\n\nJobs and Apple took end-to-end responsibility for the user experience\u2014something too few companies do. From the performance of the ARM microprocessor in the iPhone to the act of buying that phone in an Apple Store, every aspect of the customer experience was tightly linked together. Both Microsoft in the 1980s and Google in the past few years have taken a more open approach that allows their operating systems and software to be used by various hardware manufacturers. That has sometimes proved the better business model. But Jobs fervently believed that it was a recipe for (to use his technical term) crappier products. \u201cPeople are busy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have other things to do than think about how to integrate their computers and devices.\u201d\n\nBeing in the Apple ecosystem could be as sublime as walking in one of the Zen gardens of Kyoto that Jobs loved.\n\nPart of Jobs\u2019s compulsion to take responsibility for what he called \u201cthe whole widget\u201d stemmed from his personality, which was very controlling. But it was also driven by his passion for perfection and making elegant products. He got hives, or worse, when contemplating the use of great Apple software on another company\u2019s uninspired hardware, and he was equally allergic to the thought that unapproved apps or content might pollute the perfection of an Apple device. It was an approach that did not always maximize short-term profits, but in a world filled with junky devices, inscrutable error messages, and annoying interfaces, it led to astonishing products marked by delightful user experiences. Being in the Apple ecosystem could be as sublime as walking in one of the Zen gardens of Kyoto that Jobs loved, and neither experience was created by worshipping at the altar of openness or by letting a thousand flowers bloom. Sometimes it\u2019s nice to be in the hands of a control freak.\n\nWhen Behind, Leapfrog\n\nThe mark of an innovative company is not only that it comes up with new ideas first. It also knows how to leapfrog when it finds itself behind. That happened when Jobs built the original iMac. He focused on making it useful for managing a user\u2019s photos and videos, but it was left behind when dealing with music. People with PCs were downloading and swapping music and then ripping and burning their own CDs. The iMac\u2019s slot drive couldn\u2019t burn CDs. \u201cI felt like a dope,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought we had missed it.\u201d\n\nBut instead of merely catching up by upgrading the iMac\u2019s CD drive, he decided to create an integrated system that would transform the music industry. The result was the combination of iTunes, the iTunes Store, and the iPod, which allowed users to buy, share, manage, store, and play music better than they could with any other devices.\n\nAfter the iPod became a huge success, Jobs spent little time relishing it. Instead he began to worry about what might endanger it. One possibility was that mobile phone makers would start adding music players to their handsets. So he cannibalized iPod sales by creating the iPhone. \u201cIf we don\u2019t cannibalize ourselves, someone else will,\u201d he said.\n\nPut Products Before Profits\n\nWhen Jobs and his small team designed the original Macintosh, in the early 1980s, his injunction was to make it \u201cinsanely great.\u201d He never spoke of profit maximization or cost trade-offs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about price, just specify the computer\u2019s abilities,\u201d he told the original team leader. At his first retreat with the Macintosh team, he began by writing a maxim on his whiteboard: \u201cDon\u2019t compromise.\u201d The machine that resulted cost too much and led to Jobs\u2019s ouster from Apple. But the Macintosh also \u201cput a dent in the universe,\u201d as he said, by accelerating the home computer revolution. And in the long run he got the balance right: Focus on making the product great and the profits will follow.\n\nJohn Sculley, who ran Apple from 1983 to 1993, was a marketing and sales executive from Pepsi. He focused more on profit maximization than on product design after Jobs left, and Apple gradually declined. \u201cI have my own theory about why decline happens at companies,\u201d Jobs told me: They make some great products, but then the sales and marketing people take over the company, because they are the ones who can juice up profits. \u201cWhen the sales guys run the company, the product guys don\u2019t matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It happened at Apple when Sculley came in, which was my fault, and it happened when Ballmer took over at Microsoft.\u201d\n\nWhen Jobs returned, he shifted Apple\u2019s focus back to making innovative products: the sprightly iMac, the PowerBook, and then the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. As he explained, \u201cMy passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products. Everything else was secondary. Sure, it was great to make a profit, because that was what allowed you to make great products. But the products, not the profits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to make money. It\u2019s a subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything\u2014the people you hire, who gets promoted, what you discuss in meetings.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Be a Slave To Focus Groups\n\nWhen Jobs took his original Macintosh team on its first retreat, one member asked whether they should do some market research to see what customers wanted. \u201cNo,\u201d Jobs replied, \u201cbecause customers don\u2019t know what they want until we\u2019ve shown them.\u201d He invoked Henry Ford\u2019s line \u201cIf I\u2019d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, \u2018A faster horse!\u2019\u201d\n\nCaring deeply about what customers want is much different from continually asking them what they want; it requires intuition and instinct about desires that have not yet formed. \u201cOur task is to read things that are not yet on the page,\u201d Jobs explained. Instead of relying on market research, he honed his version of empathy\u2014an intimate intuition about the desires of his customers. He developed his appreciation for intuition\u2014feelings that are based on accumulated experiential wisdom\u2014while he was studying Buddhism in India as a college dropout. \u201cThe people in the Indian countryside don\u2019t use their intellect like we do; they use their intuition instead,\u201d he recalled. \u201cIntuition is a very powerful thing\u2014more powerful than intellect, in my opinion.\u201d\n\nSometimes that meant that Jobs used a one-person focus group: himself. He made products that he and his friends wanted. For example, there were many portable music players around in 2000, but Jobs felt they were all lame, and as a music fanatic he wanted a simple device that would allow him to carry a thousand songs in his pocket. \u201cWe made the iPod for ourselves,\u201d he said, \u201cand when you\u2019re doing something for yourself, or your best friend or family, you\u2019re not going to cheese out.\u201d\n\nBend Reality\n\nJobs\u2019s (in)famous ability to push people to do the impossible was dubbed by colleagues his Reality Distortion Field, after an episode of Star Trek in which aliens create a convincing alternative reality through sheer mental force. An early example was when Jobs was on the night shift at Atari and pushed Steve Wozniak to create a game called Breakout. Woz said it would take months, but Jobs stared at him and insisted he could do it in four days. Woz knew that was impossible, but he ended up doing it.\n\nJobs\u2019s (in)famous ability to push people to do the impossible was dubbed by colleagues his Reality Distortion Field, after an episode of Star Trek.\n\nThose who did not know Jobs interpreted the Reality Distortion Field as a euphemism for bullying and lying. But those who worked with him admitted that the trait, infuriating as it might be, led them to perform extraordinary feats. Because Jobs felt that life\u2019s ordinary rules didn\u2019t apply to him, he could inspire his team to change the course of computer history with a small fraction of the resources that Xerox or IBM had. \u201cIt was a self-fulfilling distortion,\u201d recalls Debi Coleman, a member of the original Mac team who won an award one year for being the employee who best stood up to Jobs. \u201cYou did the impossible because you didn\u2019t realize it was impossible.\u201d\n\nOne day Jobs marched into the cubicle of Larry Kenyon, the engineer who was working on the Macintosh operating system, and complained that it was taking too long to boot up. Kenyon started to explain why reducing the boot-up time wasn\u2019t possible, but Jobs cut him off. \u201cIf it would save a person\u2019s life, could you find a way to shave 10 seconds off the boot time?\u201d he asked. Kenyon allowed that he probably could. Jobs went to a whiteboard and showed that if five million people were using the Mac and it took 10 seconds extra to turn it on every day, that added up to 300 million or so hours a year\u2014the equivalent of at least 100 lifetimes a year. After a few weeks Kenyon had the machine booting up 28 seconds faster.\n\nWhen Jobs was designing the iPhone, he decided that he wanted its face to be a tough, scratchproof glass, rather than plastic. He met with Wendell Weeks, the CEO of Corning, who told him that Corning had developed a chemical exchange process in the 1960s that led to what it dubbed \u201cGorilla glass.\u201d Jobs replied that he wanted a major shipment of Gorilla glass in six months. Weeks said that Corning was not making the glass and didn\u2019t have that capacity. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201d Jobs replied. This stunned Weeks, who was unfamiliar with Jobs\u2019s Reality Distortion Field. He tried to explain that a false sense of confidence would not overcome engineering challenges, but Jobs had repeatedly shown that he didn\u2019t accept that premise. He stared unblinking at Weeks. \u201cYes, you can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cGet your mind around it. You can do it.\u201d Weeks recalls that he shook his head in astonishment and then called the managers of Corning\u2019s facility in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, which had been making LCD displays, and told them to convert immediately to making Gorilla glass full-time. \u201cWe did it in under six months,\u201d he says. \u201cWe put our best scientists and engineers on it, and we just made it work.\u201d As a result, every piece of glass on an iPhone or an iPad is made in America by Corning.\n\nImpute\n\nJobs\u2019s early mentor Mike Markkula wrote him a memo in 1979 that urged three principles. The first two were \u201cempathy\u201d and \u201cfocus.\u201d The third was an awkward word, \u201cimpute,\u201d but it became one of Jobs\u2019s key doctrines. He knew that people form an opinion about a product or a company on the basis of how it is presented and packaged. \u201cMike taught me that people do judge a book by its cover,\u201d he told me.\n\nWhen he was getting ready to ship the Macintosh in 1984, he obsessed over the colors and design of the box. Similarly, he personally spent time designing and redesigning the jewellike boxes that cradle the iPod and the iPhone and listed himself on the patents for them. He and Ive believed that unpacking was a ritual like theater and heralded the glory of the product. \u201cWhen you open the box of an iPhone or iPad, we want that tactile experience to set the tone for how you perceive the product,\u201d Jobs said.\n\nSometimes Jobs used the design of a machine to \u201cimpute\u201d a signal rather than to be merely functional. For example, when he was creating the new and playful iMac, after his return to Apple, he was shown a design by Ive that had a little recessed handle nestled in the top. It was more semiotic than useful. This was a desktop computer. Not many people were really going to carry it around. But Jobs and Ive realized that a lot of people were still intimidated by computers. If it had a handle, the new machine would seem friendly, deferential, and at one\u2019s service. The handle signaled permission to touch the iMac. The manufacturing team was opposed to the extra cost, but Jobs simply announced, \u201cNo, we\u2019re doing this.\u201d He didn\u2019t even try to explain.\n\nPush for Perfection\n\nDuring the development of almost every product he ever created, Jobs at a certain point \u201chit the pause button\u201d and went back to the drawing board because he felt it wasn\u2019t perfect. That happened even with the movie Toy Story. After Jeff Katzenberg and the team at Disney, which had bought the rights to the movie, pushed the Pixar team to make it edgier and darker, Jobs and the director, John Lasseter, finally stopped production and rewrote the story to make it friendlier. When he was about to launch Apple Stores, he and his store guru, Ron Johnson, suddenly decided to delay everything a few months so that the stores\u2019 layouts could be reorganized around activities and not just product categories.\n\nThe same was true for the iPhone. The initial design had the glass screen set into an aluminum case. One Monday morning Jobs went over to see Ive. \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep last night,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I realized that I just don\u2019t love it.\u201d Ive, to his dismay, instantly saw that Jobs was right. \u201cI remember feeling absolutely embarrassed that he had to make the observation,\u201d he says. The problem was that the iPhone should have been all about the display, but in its current design the case competed with the display instead of getting out of the way. The whole device felt too masculine, task-driven, efficient. \u201cGuys, you\u2019ve killed yourselves over this design for the last nine months, but we\u2019re going to change it,\u201d Jobs told Ive\u2019s team. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to have to work nights and weekends, and if you want, we can hand out some guns so you can kill us now.\u201d Instead of balking, the team agreed. \u201cIt was one of my proudest moments at Apple,\u201d Jobs recalled.\n\nA similar thing happened as Jobs and Ive were finishing the iPad. At one point Jobs looked at the model and felt slightly dissatisfied. It didn\u2019t seem casual and friendly enough to scoop up and whisk away. They needed to signal that you could grab it with one hand, on impulse. They decided that the bottom edge should be slightly rounded, so that a user would feel comfortable just snatching it up rather than lifting it carefully. That meant engineering had to design the necessary connection ports and buttons in a thin, simple lip that sloped away gently underneath. Jobs delayed the product until the change could be made.\n\nJobs\u2019s perfectionism extended even to the parts unseen. As a young boy, he had helped his father build a fence around their backyard, and he was told they had to use just as much care on the back of the fence as on the front. \u201cNobody will ever know,\u201d Steve said. His father replied, \u201cBut you will know.\u201d A true craftsman uses a good piece of wood even for the back of a cabinet against the wall, his father explained, and they should do the same for the back of the fence. It was the mark of an artist to have such a passion for perfection. In overseeing the Apple II and the Macintosh, Jobs applied this lesson to the circuit board inside the machine. In both instances he sent the engineers back to make the chips line up neatly so the board would look nice. This seemed particularly odd to the engineers of the Macintosh, because Jobs had decreed that the machine be tightly sealed. \u201cNobody is going to see the PC board,\u201d one of them protested. Jobs reacted as his father had: \u201cI want it to be as beautiful as possible, even if it\u2019s inside the box. A great carpenter isn\u2019t going to use lousy wood for the back of a cabinet, even though nobody\u2019s going to see it.\u201d They were true artists, he said, and should act that way. And once the board was redesigned, he had the engineers and other members of the Macintosh team sign their names so that they could be engraved inside the case. \u201cReal artists sign their work,\u201d he said.\n\nTolerate Only \u201cA\u201d Players\n\nJobs was famously impatient, petulant, and tough with the people around him. But his treatment of people, though not laudable, emanated from his passion for perfection and his desire to work with only the best. It was his way of preventing what he called \u201cthe bozo explosion,\u201d in which managers are so polite that mediocre people feel comfortable sticking around. \u201cI don\u2019t think I run roughshod over people,\u201d he said, \u201cbut if something sucks, I tell people to their face. It\u2019s my job to be honest.\u201d When I pressed him on whether he could have gotten the same results while being nicer, he said perhaps so. \u201cBut it\u2019s not who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s a better way\u2014a gentlemen\u2019s club where we all wear ties and speak in this Brahmin language and velvet code words\u2014but I don\u2019t know that way, because I am middle-class from California.\u201d\n\nWas all his stormy and abusive behavior necessary? Probably not. There were other ways he could have motivated his team. \u201cSteve\u2019s contributions could have been made without so many stories about him terrorizing folks,\u201d Apple\u2019s cofounder, Wozniak, said. \u201cI like being more patient and not having so many conflicts. I think a company can be a good family.\u201d But then he added something that is undeniably true: \u201cIf the Macintosh project had been run my way, things probably would have been a mess.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to appreciate that Jobs\u2019s rudeness and roughness were accompanied by an ability to be inspirational. He infused Apple employees with an abiding passion to create groundbreaking products and a belief that they could accomplish what seemed impossible. And we have to judge him by the outcome. Jobs had a close-knit family, and so it was at Apple: His top players tended to stick around longer and be more loyal than those at other companies, including ones led by bosses who were kinder and gentler. CEOs who study Jobs and decide to emulate his roughness without understanding his ability to generate loyalty make a dangerous mistake.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned over the years that when you have really good people, you don\u2019t have to baby them,\u201d Jobs told me. \u201cBy expecting them to do great things, you can get them to do great things. Ask any member of that Mac team. They will tell you it was worth the pain.\u201d Most of them do. \u201cHe would shout at a meeting, \u2018You asshole, you never do anything right,\u2019\u201d Debi Coleman recalls. \u201cYet I consider myself the absolute luckiest person in the world to have worked with him.\u201d\n\nEngage Face-to-Face\n\nDespite being a denizen of the digital world, or maybe because he knew all too well its potential to be isolating, Jobs was a strong believer in face-to-face meetings. \u201cThere\u2019s a temptation in our networked age to think that ideas can be developed by e-mail and iChat,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they\u2019re doing, you say \u2018Wow,\u2019 and soon you\u2019re cooking up all sorts of ideas.\u201d\n\nHe had the Pixar building designed to promote unplanned encounters and collaborations. \u201cIf a building doesn\u2019t encourage that, you\u2019ll lose a lot of innovation and the magic that\u2019s sparked by serendipity,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we designed the building to make people get out of their offices and mingle in the central atrium with people they might not otherwise see.\u201d The front doors and main stairs and corridors all led to the atrium; the caf\u00e9 and the mailboxes were there; the conference rooms had windows that looked out onto it; and the 600-seat theater and two smaller screening rooms all spilled into it. \u201cSteve\u2019s theory worked from day one,\u201d Lasseter recalls. \u201cI kept running into people I hadn\u2019t seen for months. I\u2019ve never seen a building that promoted collaboration and creativity as well as this one.\u201d\n\nJobs hated formal presentations, but he loved freewheeling face-to-face meetings. He gathered his executive team every week to kick around ideas without a formal agenda, and he spent every Wednesday afternoon doing the same with his marketing and advertising team. Slide shows were banned. \u201cI hate the way people use slide presentations instead of thinking,\u201d Jobs recalled. \u201cPeople would confront a problem by creating a presentation. I wanted them to engage, to hash things out at the table, rather than show a bunch of slides. People who know what they\u2019re talking about don\u2019t need PowerPoint.\u201d\n\nKnow Both the Big Picture and the Details\n\nJobs\u2019s passion was applied to issues both large and minuscule. Some CEOs are great at vision; others are managers who know that God is in the details. Jobs was both. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes says that one of Jobs\u2019s salient traits was his ability and desire to envision overarching strategy while also focusing on the tiniest aspects of design. For example, in 2000 he came up with the grand vision that the personal computer should become a \u201cdigital hub\u201d for managing all of a user\u2019s music, videos, photos, and content, and thus got Apple into the personal-device business with the iPod and then the iPad. In 2010 he came up with the successor strategy\u2014the \u201chub\u201d would move to the cloud\u2014and Apple began building a huge server farm so that all a user\u2019s content could be uploaded and then seamlessly synced to other personal devices. But even as he was laying out these grand visions, he was fretting over the shape and color of the screws inside the iMac.\n\nCombine the Humanities with the Sciences\n\n\u201cI always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics,\u201d Jobs told me on the day he decided to cooperate on a biography. \u201cThen I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that\u2019s what I wanted to do.\u201d It was as if he was describing the theme of his life, and the more I studied him, the more I realized that this was, indeed, the essence of his tale.\n\nNo one else in our era could better firewire together poetry and processors in a way that jolted innovation.\n\nHe connected the humanities to the sciences, creativity to technology, arts to engineering. There were greater technologists (Wozniak, Gates), and certainly better designers and artists. But no one else in our era could better firewire together poetry and processors in a way that jolted innovation. And he did it with an intuitive feel for business strategy. At almost every product launch over the past decade, Jobs ended with a slide that showed a sign at the intersection of Liberal Arts and Technology Streets.\n\nThe creativity that can occur when a feel for both the humanities and the sciences exists in one strong personality was what most interested me in my biographies of Franklin and Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to building innovative economies in the 21st century. It is the essence of applied imagination, and it\u2019s why both the humanities and the sciences are critical for any society that is to have a creative edge in the future.\n\nEven when he was dying, Jobs set his sights on disrupting more industries. He had a vision for turning textbooks into artistic creations that anyone with a Mac could fashion and craft\u2014something that Apple announced in January 2012. He also dreamed of producing magical tools for digital photography and ways to make television simple and personal. Those, no doubt, will come as well. And even though he will not be around to see them to fruition, his rules for success helped him build a company that not only will create these and other disruptive products, but will stand at the intersection of creativity and technology as long as Jobs\u2019s DNA persists at its core.\n\nStay Hungry, Stay Foolish\n\nSteve Jobs was a product of the two great social movements that emanated from the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1960s. The first was the counterculture of hippies and antiwar activists, which was marked by psychedelic drugs, rock music, and antiauthoritarianism. The second was the high-tech and hacker culture of Silicon Valley, filled with engineers, geeks, wireheads, phreakers, cyberpunks, hobbyists, and garage entrepreneurs. Overlying both were various paths to personal enlightenment\u2014Zen and Hinduism, meditation and yoga, primal scream therapy and sensory deprivation, Esalen and est.\n\nAn admixture of these cultures was found in publications such as Stewart Brand\u2019s Whole Earth Catalog. On its first cover was the famous picture of Earth taken from space, and its subtitle was \u201caccess to tools.\u201d The underlying philosophy was that technology could be our friend. Jobs\u2014who became a hippie, a rebel, a spiritual seeker, a phone phreaker, and an electronic hobbyist all wrapped into one\u2014was a fan. He was particularly taken by the final issue, which came out in 1971, when he was still in high school. He took it with him to college and then to the apple farm commune where he lived after dropping out. He later recalled: \u201cOn the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words: \u2018Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\u2019\u201d Jobs stayed hungry and foolish throughout his career by making sure that the business and engineering aspect of his personality was always complemented by a hippie nonconformist side from his days as an artistic, acid-dropping, enlightenment-seeking rebel. In every aspect of his life\u2014the women he dated, the way he dealt with his cancer diagnosis, the way he ran his business\u2014his behavior reflected the contradictions, confluence, and eventual synthesis of all these varying strands.\n\nEven as Apple became corporate, Jobs asserted his rebel and counterculture streak in its ads, as if to proclaim that he was still a hacker and a hippie at heart. The famous \u201c1984\u201d ad showed a renegade woman outrunning the thought police to sling a sledgehammer at the screen of an Orwellian Big Brother. And when he returned to Apple, Jobs helped write the text for the \u201cThink Different\u201d ads: \u201cHere\u2019s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes\u2026\u201d If there was any doubt that, consciously or not, he was describing himself, he dispelled it with the last lines: \u201cWhile some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.macworld.com/article/219225/steve-jobss-seven-key-decisions.html", "page_content": "When Steve Jobs officially returned to Apple 15 years ago, it marked a moment of rebirth for the ailing company. Within eight months (September 17, 1997, to be exact), he assumed the mantle of Interim CEO (later abbreviated to \u201ciCEO\u201d for cuteness) and executed a stark and keen strategy to save Apple from oblivion.\n\nAlmost a year after his untimely passing, it\u2019s a good time to look back at seven key moves Jobs made to right the Apple ship during his early days as iCEO.\n\nThis is not meant to be an exhaustive or complete study: Jobs made dozens of decisions a day. I don\u2019t include some of his most important decisions\u2014for example, the ones to pursue the development of innovative new products such as the iMac, OS X, and the iPod. Instead, I\u2019m thinking about the operational decisions that put his company on the track it still follows to this day.\n\nTaking the reins\n\nThe most important decision Steve Jobs made was to take control of Apple. It didn\u2019t have to be that way.\n\nFormer Apple CEO Gil Amelio.\n\nAfter the purchase of NeXT in late 1996, Apple\u2019s then-CEO Gil Amelio brought Jobs in as a special advisor in January 1997. Jobs could have been content to simply provide advice and stay out of the way. Of course, that wasn\u2019t in his nature. Jobs quickly convinced Apple\u2019s board of directors to oust Amelio. It wasn\u2019t long before Jobs nominated himself as a potential replacement. The board agreed, and Jobs was back in control.\n\nTrimming the fat\n\nBefore Jobs came back to Apple, the company manufactured dozens of different Macintosh desktops, laptops, and servers in a dizzying array of variations. The firm also produced lines of printers, digital cameras, and other ancillary items, few of which made a profit.\n\nThe MessagePad 2000, which ran Apple\u2019s Newton OS.\n\nUltimately, Jobs axed more than 70 percent of Apple\u2019s hardware and software products. Most famously, he cancelled the Newton PDA, which still rankles some today.\n\nIn the Macintosh realm, Jobs wiped the slate clean. He defined a simple four-square grid to represent the future of the Macintosh: two for consumer desktops and portables (which would be occupied by the iMac and the iBook, respectively), and two for pro desktops and portables (filled by the Power Macintosh and the PowerBook, respectively). Anything that didn\u2019t fit in that grid got cut.\n\nHis product cuts resulted in the layoffs of over 3000 employees during Jobs\u2019s first year as iCEO. But those cuts, while painful at first, allowed Apple to focus on creating a handful of good products instead of dozens of mediocre ones.\n\nCleaning house\n\nBy 1996, most members of Apple\u2019s Board of Directors had been focused on how they could chop up Apple and sell it to the highest bidder. Upon his return, Jobs knew he needed a new board with a more positive attitude and a deeper loyalty to him as a leader. Within a few weeks, Jobs managed to force the resignation of most of Apple\u2019s board members, including former CEO Mike Markkula\u2014the man who provided critical seed money to get Apple off the ground in 1977.\n\nIn their place, Jobs installed close friends like Oracle CEO Larry Ellison and former Apple VP of Marketing Bill Campbell.\n\nJobs also restructured Apple as a company, clearing away the many product-centric departments that feuded and competed for company resources. In its place, Jobs installed company-wide departments for marketing, sales, manufacturing, and finance.\n\nFormer Apple Senior VP of Software Engineering Avie Tevanian.\n\nPrior to Jobs becoming iCEO, he had convinced Gil Amelio to place certain key NeXT employees in positions of influence at Apple. Most notable was Avie Tevanian, the mastermind behind OS X, who became Apple\u2019s Senior VP of Software Engineering in February 1997, and Jon Rubinstein, who joined as Senior VP of Hardware Engineering the same month.\n\nBefore long, Jobs had hired a variety of NeXT veterans and other high-level employees loyal to the new CEO, which ensured that few executives would question his drastic new policies.\n\nPlugging the leaks\n\nUnder Gil Amelio, intentional press leaks from Apple employees occurred frequently\u2014attempts to embarrass the CEO into changing his policies. That stopped under Steve Jobs. Not long after accepting the position of Interim CEO, Jobs instituted a total ban on Apple employees talking to the press. That, along with key layoffs, helped quell dissent within the company.\n\nOver the years, Jobs\u2019s no-press policy also had the effect of creating the strict veil of secrecy, suspense, and surprise that accompanied Apple product announcements. By tightly controlling the flow of information out of Apple, Jobs kept the tech media in the palm of his hand.\n\nBurying the hatchet\n\nDuring his first tenure at Apple, Steve Jobs had been largely responsible for portraying the battle for the PC marketplace as a direct conflict between Apple and IBM. As an extension, that pitted Apple against Microsoft, the company that provided the IBM PC\u2019s operating system and later sought to duplicate the look and feel of the graphical Macintosh OS with Windows.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Bill Gates, as he appeared at the 1997 Macworld Expo in Boston.\n\nThe animosity between underdog Apple and market leader Microsoft continued well past 1985, when Jobs resigned from Apple. The rift became a part of Apple culture that manifested itself as a deep loathing for everything Microsoft or Wintel. Meanwhile, the Macintosh\u2019s market share shrank down to single digits.\n\nBy 1996, Jobs had been comfortably removed from the situation long enough to admit that the desktop PC wars were over; Microsoft had won. It was counterproductive, Jobs thought, to spend money and energy fighting a battle against Microsoft that could not be won. No, Apple would have to play it cool and compete on its own terms. In the meantime, it would help to have the Redmond giant on its side instead of directly opposed to the struggling company.\n\nIn exchange for a patent cross-licensing deal, Microsoft vowed to devote significant manpower to developing new versions of Office and Internet Explorer for the Macintosh for at least five years. Microsoft also agreed to buy $150 million in Apple stock, which insured a vested interest in Apple\u2019s success. In return, Apple also agreed to make Internet Explorer the default browser for Mac OS for five years.\n\nThis deal, famously announced by Jobs at Boston Macworld 1997 (featuring a giant Bill Gates on a screen behind him), was part of a public appeal to Mac fans to bury the hatchet and move on. Apple could succeed alongside Microsoft, not in spite of it, he said. Jobs\u2019 new position on Microsoft freed up mental energy in Apple, so developers and fans alike could move on and conquer new markets in the years ahead.\n\nKilling the clones\n\nIn 1994, Apple began licensing Mac OS to a handful of select vendors who paid Apple $80 per machine to use the operating system. As the years went by, it became apparent that this wasn\u2019t such a great idea. The clone manufacturers produced relatively low-cost machines that cannibalized Apple\u2019s most profitable product line, and the clones did not have the intended effect of significantly expanding the footprint of the Mac platform.\n\nSo when Jobs returned to Apple, he knew the Mac OS licensing program had to go. He declined to license Mac OS 8 to the clone vendors upon its release in 1997, thus effectively ending the clone program (one manufacturer, UMAX, did manage to license OS 8 until 1998, however).\n\nJobs believed strongly in controlling the total user experience from hardware to software, and that could not be achieved if the hardware end was out of Apple\u2019s hands. Clones watered down the Macintosh brand, and if they had remained, Apple could not have become as proficient at the secrecy, desire, and new product execution as they later became famous for.\n\nTrusting Jonathan Ive\n\nWhen Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1996, Jonathan Ive was already head of the company\u2019s design team. He was thinking about quitting, in fact, until a company-wide presentation by Steve Jobs convinced him to stay.\n\nJonathan Ive, Apple Senior Vice President, Industrial Design.\n\nAt first, Jobs looked to outside star designers for a possible new head of design, but Ive and Jobs soon hit it off and became personal friends. They found that they shared key elements of their design philosophies.\n\nAs a result of the newfound camaraderie, Steve Jobs put his faith in the relatively untested designer instead of hiring someone new from the outside. The pair (with the assistance of the entire design staff, of course) would go on to create some of the most famous consumer electronics designs ever made."}, {"url": "https://openstax.org/books/entrepreneurship/pages/1-3-the-entrepreneurial-mindset", "page_content": "Learning Objectives By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain what it means to have an entrepreneurial mindset\n\nDescribe what is meant by entrepreneurial spirit or passion\n\nEntrepreneurship takes many forms (see Table 1.1), but entrepreneurs share a major trait in common: An entrepreneur is someone who identifies an opportunity and chooses to act on that opportunity. Most business ventures are innovative variations of an existing idea that has spread across communities, regions, and countries, such as starting a restaurant or opening a retail store. These business ventures are, in some ways, a lower-risk approach but nonetheless are entrepreneurial in some way. For example, Warby Parker, a profitable startup founded by four graduate students at Wharton, disrupted a major incumbent (Luxottica) by providing a more convenient (online initially), affordable, and stylish product line for a large segment of consumers. In this sense, their innovation is about creating something new, unique, or different from the mainstream. Yet they attracted an existing, and in some ways mature, sector of an established industry. In a different way, McDonalds, which is 90 percent owned by franchisees, introduced an \u201call day breakfast\u201d menu in 2017 that was hugely successful; it also targeted a larger segment (in part younger consumers) and brought back consumers who had chosen other options. In summary, many entrepreneurs start a new venture by solving a problem that is significant, offering some value that other people would appreciate if the product or service were available to them. Other entrepreneurs, in contrast, start a venture by offering a \u201cbetter mousetrap\u201d in terms of a product, service, or both. In any case, it is vital that the entrepreneur understand the market and target segment well, articulate a key unmet need (\u201cpain point\u201d), and develop and deliver a solution that is both viable and feasible. In that aspect, many entrepreneurs mitigate risks before they launch the venture.\n\nBeing aware of your surroundings and the encounters in your life can reveal multiple opportunities for entrepreneurship. In our daily lives, we constantly find areas where improvements could be made. For example, you might ask, \u201cWhat if we didn\u2019t have to commute to work?\u201d \u201cWhat if we didn\u2019t have to own a vehicle but still had access to one?\u201d \u201cWhat if we could relax while driving to work instead of being stressed out by traffic?\u201d These types of questions inspired entrepreneurial ventures such as ride-sharing services like Uber, the self-driving vehicle industry, and short-term bicycle access in the free bike-sharing program in Pella, Iowa (Figure 1.10).\n\nFigure 1.10 A bike-sharing program in Pella, Iowa, allows users to access bikes at a variety of locations. (credit: \u201cCorral of VeoRide Dockless Bike Share\u201d by \u201cpaul.wasneski\u201d/Flickr, Public Domain)\n\nThese ideas resulted from having an entrepreneurial mindset, an awareness and focus on identifying an opportunity through solving a problem, and a willingness to move forward to advance that idea. The entrepreneurial mindset is the lens through which the entrepreneur views the world, where everything is considered in light of the entrepreneurial business. The business is always a consideration when the entrepreneur makes a decision. In most cases, the action that the entrepreneur takes is for the benefit of the business, but sometimes, it helps the entrepreneur get ready to adopt the appropriate mindset. The mindset becomes a way of life for the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs often are predisposed to action to achieve their goals and objectives. They are forward thinking, always planning ahead, and they are engaged in \u201cwhat if\u201d analyses. They frequently ask themselves, \u201cWhat if we did this?\u201d \u201cWhat if a competitor did that?\u201d\u2014and consider what the business implications would be.\n\nMost people follow habits and traditions without being aware of their surroundings or noticing the opportunities to become entrepreneurs. Because anyone can change their perspective from following established patterns to noticing the opportunities around them, anyone can become an entrepreneur. There is no restriction on age, gender, race, country of origin, or personal income. To become an entrepreneur, you need to recognize that an opportunity exists and be willing to act on it. Note, however, that the execution of the entrepreneurial mindset varies in different parts of the world. For example, in many Asian cultures, group decision-making is more common and valued as a character trait. In these regions, an entrepreneur would likely ask the advice of family members or other business associates before taking action. In contrast, individualism is highly valued in the United States and so many US entrepreneurs will decide to implement a plan for the business without consulting others.\n\nEntrepreneurial Spirit and Passion An entrepreneurial spirit allows entrepreneurs to carry a manner of thinking with them each day that allows them to overcome obstacles and to meet challenges with a can-do attitude. What does it mean to have an entrepreneurial spirit? For the purposes of this discussion, it could mean being passionate, purposeful, positive, bold, curious, or persistent. The founders of Airbnb have a passion for supporting individual rights to rent out unused space. Why should the established model of hotels prevail? Why shouldn\u2019t an individual homeowner have the freedom to rent out unused space and leverage that space into an income? Airbnb has succeeded in creating more flexible and affordable options in the space of the rapidly growing \"sharing\" economy. At the same time, some states and municipalities have raised issues about the regulations monitoring ventures like this. While entrepreneurial spirit is partly about fighting for individual rights and freedoms, there should be a balance between economic freedom and consumer protection. The entrepreneurial spirit involves a passion for presenting an idea that is worthwhile and valuable, and a willingness to think beyond established patterns and processes, while still keeping in mind local laws and regulations, in the quest to change those established patterns, or at least to offer alternatives to those established patterns. Passion is a critical component of the entrepreneurial process. Without it, an entrepreneur can lose the drive to run the business. Passion can keep an entrepreneur going when the outside world sends negative messages or less-than-positive feedback. For example, if you are truly passionate about starting an animal shelter because of your love of animals, you will find a way to make it happen. Your internal drive to help animals in need will spur you on to do whatever it takes to make the shelter become a reality. The same is true of other types of startups and owners with similar passions. However, passion needs to be informed by the entrepreneur\u2019s vision and mission\u2014passion of the sake of passion is not enough. A clear mission statement\u2014which details why the business exists and the entrepreneur\u2019s objectives for achieving that mission\u2014will guide an entrepreneur\u2019s passion and keep the business on track. Passion, vision, and mission can reinforce each other and keep the entrepreneur on the right track with next steps for the business. Some ideas might seem small or insignificant, but in the field of entrepreneurship, it\u2019s important to recognize that for every new startup, someone else may recognize a spin-off idea that expands upon the original idea. The opportunities for identifying new possibilities are endless. Review your work in creating spinoff ideas for Angad Darvani\u2019s projects, or Kevin F. Adler\u2019s Miracle Messages venture. Or consider possible spin-off ideas around the technology used in agriculture. Creating spin-off ideas fits well with our discussion of divergent thinking and brainstorming. Through these processes, we can discover new uses for existing technology, just as Ring did by using video technology to add security by allowing customers to see who is at the door without opening it."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=ridzist01", "page_content": "Steve Ridzik was born on Monday, April 29, 1929, in Yonkers, New York.

Cromie and O\u2019Donaghue (1992) conducted two studies using the GET test to evaluate the entrepreneurial tendencies of 194 managers and 661 undergraduate students. This study found that the GET test measure has criterion validity and was able to differentiate significant differences between the entrepreneur and the student populations, suggesting that the instrument has good validity. Further work was recommended on the GET scales to assess their discriminant and predictive validity and general psychometric properties when used with different samples.\n\nPersons with entrepreneurial propensity were viewed as those with high creative tendency, above average need for autonomy, and high calculated risk-taking orientation. Such people may also have high need for achievement and internal locus of control, but potentially not be significantly different from others. Potential entrepreneurs were also more likely to have had a father who was self-employed or to have been self-employed at some stage in the past (Cromie et al. 1992). Stormer et al. (1999) also evaluated the GET test in order to assess its ability to predict small business success using a sample of 128 owner-managers. They found that the GET test has reliability in its use within research, but was poor at predicting success in small business. They recommended that the scale be revised to \u2018form more coherent, single aspects of personality\u2019 (p. 51).\n\nSmith et al. (2014) also used the GET test to examine differences between social entrepreneurs and more traditional ones. They found that it provided a useful measure for differentiating the two groups, but that an alternative measure, such as the Bolton Thompson Entrepreneur Indicator (BTEI) (Bolton and Thompson 2003), might have offered better measure as it included a social dimension, which is absent from the GET test. However, Lyons et al. (2015) compared the GET test to a number of other entrepreneurial measures using a sample of students studying entrepreneurship at university level. They found problems with the scale reliability of the test, suffering from some internal consistency. Although it should be noted that they were seeking to make use of the GET test to provide a measure of entrepreneurial traits, which arguably the test is not originally designed to do.\n\nIt should be noted that the purpose of the GET test is not to determine the possible success as a business owner, or even to assess whether a person is, or has the potential to be an entrepreneur. The GET test is a measure of the enterprising tendencies that are inherent in all people and provides a guide for the individual manager to assess whether or not they have above average, average or below average scores on each of the five dimensions. Further, it does not provide an assessment of an individual\u2019s inherent entrepreneurial traits that remain permanent. Our experience with using the GET test has found that it is best used as a starting point for undertaking a self-assessment of a person\u2019s enterprise tendencies, then used as a reference point for a qualitative analysis of their personal and professional history. Rather than offering a robust psychometric measure of whether an individual is \u201centrepreneurial\u201d, the GET test provides a foundation against which a person can examine why they may have scored a given set of results, and the factors in their personal and professional life that may have led them to this world view. This is explained further in the following example.\n\nIn a study we undertook to demonstrate the application of the GET test, a comparison was made between 56 managers enrolled in an MBA program in entrepreneurship and 56 successful entrepreneurs (Mazzarol 2007). Each of the MBA student managers completed the GET test. They then interviewed a person who had been identified as a successful entrepreneur, and had them also take the GET test. The test results were then evaluated within the context of the individual\u2019s personal and professional lives in order to interpret the findings and to explain why they had profiled in that way. Table 2.1 outlines the results of this study.\n\nTable 2.1 GET test scores \u2013 entrepreneurs vs. MBA students Full size table\n\nIn terms of the GET test scores, the entrepreneurs were found to score significantly higher than the MBA students on need for achievement, creativity and risk-taking. However, many of the student managers found that their scores were equal to or higher than the entrepreneurs they interviewed. When they reflected on their GET scores and compared them with those of the entrepreneurs, most of the MBA student managers were able to identify within their family or professional history explanations as to why they had these results, and more importantly why they had not followed an entrepreneurial career path.\n\nFor example, one female student manager aged 35, who was a registered nurse, scored an average of 22 out of 54 on the GET test which led her to proclaim,\n\nThe results of the GET test indicate that I have the entrepreneurial tendencies of an inanimate object!\n\nNevertheless, she felt she had several strengths, such as optimism and being forward thinking, self-sufficient and self-confident. In assessing her personal and professional background, she noted that all her working career had been spent in public hospitals. Her father had been an engineer who had established his own consulting engineering business by his mid-40s before tragically dying at the relatively young age of 51. In her view, the professional career that she had chosen was a key factor in influencing her GET test results. For example, as she concluded,\n\nIn summary, I believe that my personal background \u2013 and especially the current context \u2013 impacts highly on my tendencies towards entrepreneurialism. While I did have a positive role model in my father in terms of new venture creation, my chosen profession is one that, in direct patient care, requires conformation to rules, with risk-taking (even moderate) and creativity being attributes that are not valued.\n\nThe entrepreneur she chose to interview was a 62-year-old Australian vascular surgeon who ran a highly successful medical practice which he had established 25 years earlier. His decision to enter private practice had been driven by \u2018an intense dislike\u2019 of being employed by hospitals where he worked long hours and became embroiled in their internal politics. At the relatively young age of 37, he took a personal loan from a bank and launched his own medical practice. The early years had been hard, and he had been forced to work within the hospital on a staff position in order to generate sufficient income to keep his home and business going.\n\nThe work pressures eventually cost him his first marriage, but by the mid-1980s he had established a privately-owned vascular ultrasound laboratory as a separate new business to compliment his surgery. This innovation was a breakthrough and positioned him as a market leader, allowing him to grow the laboratory to the point where it employed over 30 staff and operated at five separate locations. At the time of the interview, the entrepreneur had just sold the laboratory business to allow him more time to devote to his second wife, and to focus on a horse stud and wine import business that involved visits to France at least twice a year.\n\nWhen analysing her interview and test scores, the nurse manager described the gap between her situation and that of the entrepreneurial surgeon as \u2018worlds apart\u2019. However, she noted that the difference between her and the surgeon was that he had a clear vision of what he wanted to achieve and had taken calculated risks in order to achieve them. By comparison, she had a tendency toward \u2018safety\u2019 and that, as a nurse, this was part of her professional training and orientation.\n\nAn interesting conclusion to this case was that this student used the course to develop a business plan for her husband, a cardiac surgeon, to help him establish a new cardiac unit with another surgeon. In her words, the shift towards an entrepreneurial mindset was a challenge for her husband: \u2018My husband was often overwhelmed by the discussions that I would force him to participate in.\u2019\n\nOther student mangers had similar experiences after using the GET test to assess themselves and a successful entrepreneur, and then reflecting on their respective life histories to ascertain why they had taken the career paths they did. As one 32-year, old MBA student \u2013 who described himself as, \u2018the child of conservative baby-boomers\u2019 \u2013 remarked after comparing himself with a successful 64-year-old entrepreneur, any lack of enterprising activity was potentially due to his childhood. As he explained:\n\nI discovered through careful reflection that my low/moderate propensity for risk-taking and internal locus of control (believed to stem from a conservative upbringing) are potential barriers to any large-scale entrepreneurial pursuits. Having said that, I believe that, if I can build my confidence through a series of small successes (preferably with a partner), my risk-taking propensity will increase and perhaps one day I might be the person being interviewed. I would therefore define myself as a nascent entrepreneur.\n\nThis student manager noted that his GET scores were marginally better than the successful entrepreneur he had interviewed. He put his own lack of entrepreneurial activity down to his family background and to a lack of self-confidence.\n\nThese examples highlight an important factor about entrepreneurship. It is not something that you are born with; it is a choice that lies within the ability of every person. We all have the primary enterprising tendencies of achievement drive, creativity, desire for autonomy, risk-taking proclivity, and locus of control. These are not personality traits; rather, they are orientations that are shaped by our life history. As managers, it is important to understand that entrepreneurs are a product of both their social and family upbringing as well as their professional career history. While personality characteristics can shape a person\u2019s entrepreneurial orientation, anyone can be enterprising."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Steve_Ridzik", "page_content": "Stephen George Ridzik (April 29, 1929 \u2013 January 8, 2008) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for five teams from 1950 to 1966, primarily the Philadelphia Phillies and Washington Senators.\n\nAmerican baseball player\n\nBaseball player\n\nQuick facts: Steve Ridzik, MLB debut, Last MLB appearance,... \u25bc\n\nBorn in Yonkers, New York, Ridzik was signed by the Phillies at the age of 16 and made his major league debut on September 4, 1950, pitching in relief. In 1953, Ridzik started 12 games and relieved in 30 more going 9-6 with an earned run average of 3.77. The Phillies traded him on April 30, 1955, along with Smoky Burgess and Stan Palys, to the Cincinnati Redlegs for Andy Seminick, Glen Gorbous, and Jim Greengrass. After having his contract sold to Seattle of the Pacific Coast League that same year, the New York Giants claimed him the next month in the Rule 5 draft.\n\nRidzik pitched for the Giants from 1957 to 1958 appearing in 56 games including 5 starts. On April 8, 1958, the Giants sold his contract to the Cleveland Indians where he would pitch in six more games before his contract was sold again to the Chicago Cubs. He would not pitch a major league game with the Cubs before his contract was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League.\n\nRidzik signed with the Washington Senators three years later in 1963 after developing a knuckleball. He would appear in 132 games, mostly in relief, over the next three years for the Senators. On April 13, 1966, his contract was sold back to his original team, the Phillies. He would appear in two games with the Phillies that year before calling it a career.\n\nAfter life as a baseball player, Ridzik worked in the Washington, D.C. area for a military food distributor until moving to Florida in the late 1980s. In Florida, he helped with the organizing of charity events featuring former Major League players. He also helped establish the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association with a former Senators teammate, Chuck Hinton. He died on January 8, 2008, after fighting heart disease for several years.[1]"}, {"url": "https://www.biography.com/business-leaders/bill-gates", "page_content": "(1955-)\n\nWho Is Bill Gates?\n\nEntrepreneur and businessman Bill Gates and his business partner Paul Allen founded and built the world's largest software business, Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest men in the world. In February 2014, Gates announced that he was stepping down as Microsoft's chairman to focus on charitable work at his foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nEarly Life\n\nGates was born William Henry Gates III on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. Gates grew up in an upper-middle-class family with his older sister, Kristianne, and younger sister, Libby. Their father, William H. Gates Sr., was a promising, if somewhat shy, law student when he met his future wife, Mary Maxwell. She was an athletic, outgoing student at the University of Washington, actively involved in student affairs and leadership.\n\nThe Gates family atmosphere was warm and close, and all three children were encouraged to be competitive and strive for excellence. Gates showed early signs of competitiveness when he coordinated family athletic games at their summer house on Puget Sound. He also relished in playing board games (Risk was his favorite) and excelled at Monopoly.\n\nGates had a very close relationship with his mother, Mary, who after a brief career as a teacher devoted her time to helping raise the children and working on civic affairs and with charities. She also served on several corporate boards, including those of the First Interstate Bank in Seattle (founded by her grandfather), the United Way and International Business Machines (IBM). She would often take Gates along when she volunteered in schools and at community organizations.\n\nEducation\n\nGates was a voracious reader as a child, spending many hours poring over reference books such as the encyclopedia. Around the age of 11 or 12, Gates's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times, and his parents worried he might become a loner.\n\nThough they were strong believers in public education, when Gates turned 13, his parents enrolled him at Seattle's exclusive preparatory Lakeside School. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English.\n\nWhile at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother's Club used proceeds from the school's rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer.\n\nGates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that he boasted about for several years when introducing himself to new people.\n\nREAD MORE: 5 Things You May Not Know About Bill Gates\n\nHarvard Dropout\n\nGates enrolled at Harvard University in the fall of 1973, originally thinking of a career in law. Much to his parents' dismay, Gates dropped out of college in 1975 to pursue his business, Microsoft, with partner Allen.\n\nGates spent more of his time in the computer lab than in class. He did not really have a study regimen; he got by on a few hours of sleep, crammed for a test, and passed with a reasonable grade.\n\nMeeting and Partnering With Paul Allen\n\nGates met Allen, who was two years his senior, in high school at Lakeside School. The pair became fast friends, bonding over their common enthusiasm for computers, even though they were very different people. Allen was more reserved and shy. Gates was feisty and at times combative.\n\nRegardless of their differences, Allen and Gates spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, the two disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab.\n\nAt one point, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys had hacked into and a scheduling program for the school.\n\nIn 1970, at the age of 15, Gates and Allen went into business together, developing \"Traf-o-Data,\" a computer program that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle. They netted $20,000 for their efforts. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company, but Gates' parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college, where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer.\n\nAllen went to Washington State University, while Gates went to Harvard, though the pair stayed in touch. After attending college for two years, Allen dropped out and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell. Around this time, he showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit. Both young men were fascinated with the possibilities of what this computer could create in the world of personal computing.\n\nThe Altair was made by a small company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). Gates and Allen contacted the company, proclaiming that they were working on a BASIC software program that would run the Altair computer. In reality, they didn't have an Altair to work with or the code to run it, but they wanted to know if MITS was interested in someone developing such software.\n\nMITS was, and its president, Ed Roberts, asked the boys for a demonstration. Gates and Allen scrambled, spending the next two months writing the BASIC software at Harvard's computer lab. Allen traveled to Albuquerque for a test run at MITS, never having tried it out on an Altair computer. It worked perfectly. Allen was hired at MITS, and Gates soon left Harvard to work with him. Together they founded Microsoft.\n\nAllen remained with Microsoft until 1983, when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. Though his cancer went into remission a year later with intensive treatment, Allen resigned from the company. Rumors abound as to why Allen left Microsoft. Some say Gates pushed him out, but many say it was a life-changing experience for Allen and he saw there were other opportunities that he could invest his time in.\n\nFounding Microsoft\n\nIn 1975, Gates and Allen formed Micro-Soft, a blend of \"micro-computer\" and \"software\" (they dropped the hyphen within a year). The company's first product was BASIC software that ran on the Altair computer.\n\nAt first, all was not smooth sailing. Although Microsoft\u2019s BASIC software program for the Altair computer netted the company a fee and royalties, it wasn't meeting their overhead. According to Gates' later account, only about 10 percent of the people using BASIC in the Altair computer had actually paid for it.\n\nMicrosoft's BASIC software was popular with computer hobbyists, who obtained pre-market copies and were reproducing and distributing them for free. At this time, many personal computer enthusiasts were not in it for the money. They felt the ease of reproduction and distribution allowed them to share software with friends and fellow computer enthusiasts. Gates thought differently. He saw the free distribution of software as stealing, especially when it involved software that was created to be sold.\n\nIn February 1976, Gates wrote an open letter to computer hobbyists, saying that continued distribution and use of software without paying for it would \"prevent good software from being written.\" In essence, pirating software would discourage developers from investing time and money into creating quality software. The letter was unpopular with computer enthusiasts, but Gates stuck to his beliefs and would use the threat of innovation as a defense when faced with charges of unfair business practices.\n\nGates had an acrimonious relationship with MITS president Ed Roberts, often resulting in shouting matches. The combative Gates clashed with Roberts on software development and the direction of the business. Roberts considered Gates spoiled and obnoxious.\n\nIn 1977, Roberts sold MITS to another computer company and went back to Georgia to enter medical school and become a doctor.\n\nGates and Allen were on their own. The pair had to sue the new owner of MITS to retain the software rights they had developed for Altair. Microsoft wrote software in different formats for other computer companies, and, at the beginning of 1979, Gates moved the company's operations to Bellevue, Washington, just east of Seattle.\n\nGates was glad to be home again in the Pacific Northwest and threw himself into his work. All 25 employees of the young company had broad responsibilities for all aspects of the operation, product development, business development and marketing.\n\nAlthough the company started out on shaky footing, by 1979 Microsoft was grossing approximately $2.5 million. At the age of 23, Gates placed himself as the head of the company. With his acumen for software development and a keen business sense, he led the company and worked as its spokesperson. Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, often rewriting code himself when he saw it necessary.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Software for IBM PCs\n\nAs the computer industry grew, with companies like Apple, Intel and IBM developing hardware and components, Gates was continuously on the road touting the merits of Microsoft software applications. He often took his mother with him. Mary was highly respected and well connected with her membership on several corporate boards, including IBM's. It was through Mary that Gates met the CEO of IBM.\n\nIn November 1980, IBM was looking for software that would operate their upcoming personal computer (PC) and approached Microsoft. Legend has it that at the first meeting with Gates someone at IBM mistook him for an office assistant and asked him to serve coffee.\n\nGates did look very young, but he quickly impressed IBM, convincing them that he and his company could meet their needs. The only problem was that Microsoft had not developed the basic operating system that would run IBM's new computers.\n\nNot to be stopped, Gates bought an operating system that was developed to run on computers similar to IBM's PC. He made a deal with the software's developer, making Microsoft the exclusive licensing agent and later full owner of the software but not telling them of the IBM deal.\n\nThe company later sued Microsoft and Gates for withholding important information. Microsoft settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, but neither Gates nor Microsoft admitted to any wrongdoing.\n\nGates had to adapt the newly purchased software to work for the IBM PC. He delivered it for a $50,000 fee, the same price he had paid for the software in its original form. IBM wanted to buy the source code, which would have given them the information to the operating system.\n\nGates refused, instead proposing that IBM pay a licensing fee for copies of the software sold with their computers. Doing this allowed Microsoft to license the software they called MS-DOS to any other PC manufacturer, should other computer companies clone the IBM PC, which they soon did. Microsoft also released software called Softcard, which allowed Microsoft BASIC to operate on Apple II machines.\n\nFollowing the development of software for IBM, between 1979 and 1981 Microsoft's growth exploded. Staff increased from 25 to 128, and revenue shot up from $2.5 million to $16 million. In mid-1981, Gates and Allen incorporated Microsoft, and Gates was appointed president and chairman of the board. Allen was named executive vice president.\n\nBy 1983, Microsoft was going global with offices in Great Britain and Japan. An estimated 30 percent of the world's computers ran on its software.\n\nRivalry With Steve Jobs\n\nThough their rivalry is legend, Microsoft and Apple shared many of their early innovations. In 1981, Apple, at the time led by Steve Jobs, invited Microsoft to help develop software for Macintosh computers. Some developers were involved in both Microsoft development and the development of Microsoft applications for Macintosh. The collaboration could be seen in some shared names between the Microsoft and Macintosh systems.\n\nIt was through this knowledge sharing that Microsoft developed Windows, a system that used a mouse to drive a graphic interface, displaying text and images on the screen. This differed greatly from the text-and-keyboard driven MS-DOS system where all text formatting showed on the screen as code and not what actually would be printed.\n\nGates quickly recognized the threat this kind of software might pose for MS-DOS and Microsoft overall. For the unsophisticated user\u2014which was most of the buying public\u2014the graphic imagery of the competing VisiCorp software used in a Macintosh system would be so much easier to use.\n\nGates announced in an advertising campaign that a new Microsoft operating system was about to be developed that would use a graphic interface. It was to be called \"Windows,\" and would be compatible with all PC software products developed on the MS-DOS system. The announcement was a bluff, in that Microsoft had no such program under development.\n\nAs a marketing tactic, it was sheer genius. Nearly 30 percent of the computer market was using the MS-DOS system and would wait for Windows software rather than change to a new system. Without people willing to change formats, software developers were unwilling to write programs for the VisiCorp system and it lost momentum by early 1985.\n\nIn November 1985, nearly two years after his announcement, Gates and Microsoft launched Windows. Visually the Windows system looked very similar to the Macintosh system Apple Computer Corporation had introduced nearly two years earlier.\n\nApple had previously given Microsoft full access to their technology while it was working on making Microsoft products compatible for Apple computers. Gates had advised Apple to license their software but they ignored the advice, being more interested in selling computers.\n\nOnce again, Gates took full advantage of the situation and created a software format that was strikingly similar to the Macintosh. Apple threatened to sue, and Microsoft retaliated, saying it would delay shipment of its Microsoft-compatible software for Macintosh users.\n\nIn the end, Microsoft prevailed in the courts. It could prove that while there were similarities in how the two software systems operated, each individual function was distinctly different.\n\nA Competitive Reputation\n\nDespite the success of Microsoft, Gates never felt totally secure. Always checking on the competition over his shoulder, Gates developed a white-hot drive and competitive spirit. Gates' assistant reported coming to work early to find someone sleeping under a desk. She considered calling security or the police until she discovered it was Gates.\n\nGates' intelligence allowed him to see all sides of the software industry, from product development to corporate strategy. When analyzing any corporate move, he developed a profile of all the possible cases and run through them, asking questions about anything that could possibly happen.\n\nHe expected everyone in the company to have the same dedication. His confrontational management style became legend, as he would challenge employees and their ideas to keep the creative process going. An unprepared presenter could hear, \"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!\" from Gates.\n\nThis was as much a test of the rigor of the employee as it was Gates' passion for his company. He was constantly checking to see if the people around him were really convinced of their ideas.\n\nMicrosoft Office and Anti-Competition Lawsuits\n\nOutside the company, Gates was gaining a reputation as a ruthless competitor. Several tech companies, led by IBM, began to develop their own operating system, called OS/2, to replace MS-DOS. Rather than give in to the pressure, Gates pushed ahead with the Windows software, improving its operation and expanding its uses.\n\nIn 1989, Microsoft introduced Microsoft Office, which bundled office productivity applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel into one system that was compatible with all Microsoft products.\n\nThe applications were not as easily compatible with OS/2. Microsoft's new version of Windows sold 100,000 copies in just two weeks, and OS/2 soon faded away. This left Microsoft with a virtual monopoly on operating systems for PCs. Soon the Federal Trade Commission began to investigate Microsoft for unfair marketing practices.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Microsoft faced a string of Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department investigations. Some related allegations that Microsoft made unfair deals with computer manufacturers who installed the Windows operating system on their computers. Other charges involved Microsoft forcing computer manufacturers to sell Microsoft's Internet Explorer as a condition for selling the Windows operating system with their computers.\n\nAt one point, Microsoft faced a possible breakup of its two divisions \u2014 operating systems and software development. Microsoft defended itself, harking back to Gates' earlier battles with software piracy and proclaiming that such restrictions were a threat to innovation. Eventually, Microsoft was able to find a settlement with the federal government to avoid a breakup.\n\nThrough it all, Gates found inventive ways to deflect the pressure with lighthearted commercials and public appearances at computer trade shows during which he posed as Star Trek's Mr. Spock. Gates continued to run the company and weather the federal investigations through the 1990s.\n\nLeaving Microsoft\n\nIn 2000, Gates stepped down from the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, turning over the job of CEO to college friend Steve Ballmer, who had been with Microsoft since 1980. Gates positioned himself as chief software architect so he could concentrate on what was for him the more passionate side of the business, though he remained chairman of the board.\n\nIn 2006, Gates announced he was transitioning himself from full-time work at Microsoft to devote more quality time to the foundation. His last full day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008.\n\nIn February 2014, Gates stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in order to move into a new position as technology adviser. Longtime Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer was replaced by 46-year-old Satya Nadella.\n\nBill and Melinda Gates Photo: Kjetil Ree [CC BY-SA 3.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0)]\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 1987, a 23-year-old Microsoft product manager named Melinda French caught the eye of Gates, then 32. The very bright and organized Melinda was a perfect match for Gates. In time, their relationship grew as they discovered an intimate and intellectual connection. On January 1, 1994, Melinda and Gates were married in Hawaii.\n\nFollowing the devastating death of his mother to breast cancer just a few months after their wedding, they took some time off in 1995 to travel and get a new perspective on life and the world. In 1996, their first daughter, Jennifer, was born. Their son, Rory, was born in 1999, and a second daughter, Phoebe, arrived in 2002.\n\nThe pair announced the end of their marriage in May 2021.\n\nPersonal Wealth\n\nIn March 1986, Gates took Microsoft public with an initial public offering (IPO) of $21 per share, making him an instant millionaire at age 31. Gates held 45 percent of the company's 24.7 million shares, making his stake at that time $234 million of Microsoft's $520 million.\n\nOver time, the company's stock increased in value and split numerous times. In 1987, Gates became a billionaire when the stock hit $90.75 a share. Since then, Gates has been at the top, or at least near the top, of Forbes' annual list of the top 400 wealthiest people in America. In 1999, with stock prices at an all-time high and the stock splitting eight-fold since its IPO, Gates' wealth briefly topped $101 billion.\n\nHome\n\nIn 1997, Gates and his family moved into a 55,000-square-foot house on the shore of Lake Washington. Though the house serves as a business center, it is said to be very cozy for the couple and their three children.\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\n\nIn 1994, Bill and Melinda established the William H. Gates Foundation, which was dedicated to supporting education, world health and investment in low-income communities around the world. The organization also tackles domestic issues, such as helping students in the United States become college-ready.\n\nWith Melinda's influence, Bill had taken an interest in becoming a civic leader in the footsteps of his mother, studying the philanthropic work of American industrial titans Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller. He realized that he had an obligation to give more of his wealth to charity.\n\nIn 2000, the couple combined several family foundations and made a $28 billion contribution to form the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Over the next few years, Bill\u2019s involvement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation occupied much of his time and even more of his interest.\n\nSince stepping down from Microsoft, Gates devotes much of his time and energy to the work of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2015, Gates spoke out in favor of national Common Core standards in grades K through 12 and charter schools. Gates also proved to be a groundbreaking employer when, around this time, the foundation announced that it would give its employees a year's paid leave after the birth or adoption of a child.\n\nIn 2017, the foundation launched the first of what was to become its annual \"Goalkeepers\" report, an examination of progress made in several important areas related to public health, including child mortality, malnutrition and HIV. At the time, Gates identified infectious and chronic disease as the two biggest public health concerns that needed to be addressed over the coming decade.\n\nIn April 2018, Gates announced that he was teaming with Google co-founder Larry Page to provide $12 million in funding for a universal flu vaccine. He said the funds would be awarded in grants of up to $2 million for individual efforts that are \"bold and innovative,\" aiming to begin clinical trials by 2021. Although some questioned whether $12 million would be enough to spark any real medical breakthrough, others praised the intentions behind the investment, while Gates indicated that there could be more to come.\n\nAlzheimer's Research\n\nGates revealed in November 2017 that he was investing $50 million of his own money into the Dementia Discovery Fund. He would follow with another $50 million toward start-up ventures working in Alzheimer\u2019s research. It was said to be a personal matter for Gates, who has seen the devastating effects of the disease on his own family members.\n\n\"Any type of treatment would be a huge advance from where we are today,\" he told CNN, adding, \"the long-term goal has got to be cure.\"\n\nBuilding a 'Smart City' in Arizona\n\nIn 2017, it was revealed that one of Gates's firms had invested $80 million into the development of a \"smart city\" near Phoenix, Arizona. The proposed city, named Belmont, will \"create a forward-thinking community with a communication and infrastructure spine that embraces cutting-edge technology, designed around high-speed digital networks, data centers, new manufacturing technologies and distribution models, autonomous vehicles and autonomous logistics hubs,\" according to the Belmont Partners real estate investment group.\n\nOf the nearly 25,000 acres of land designated for the site; it was reported that 3,800 acres will go toward office, commercial and retail space. Another 470 acres will be used for public schools, leaving room for 80,000 residential units.\n\nCoronavirus\n\nAfter years of warning that the world was not ready for the next pandemic, Gates saw his ominous words come true with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in 2020. In March, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation teamed with the Wellcome Trust and Mastercard to pledge $125 million toward efforts to curb the outbreak, and Gates subsequently revealed that his foundation was prepared to invest billions of dollars into building factories earmarked for the development of a vaccine.\n\nAwards\n\nGates has received numerous awards for philanthropic work.
