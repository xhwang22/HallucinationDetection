{"Despite her disability, Anne de Gaulle was a bright and determined young woman.": [{"url": "http://www.cmq.org.uk/CMQ/2022/Aug/Anne_de_Gaulle.html", "page_content": "Catholic Medical Quarterly Volume 72 (3) August 2022\n\nGeneral Charles De Gaulle and a very special person with Down\u2019s Syndrome\n\nAnne de Gaulle was the youngest daughter of General Charles de Gaulle. She was born in 1928 in Trier, Germany, where her father was stationed with the Army of Occupation in the Rhineland. De Gaulle\u2019s wife Yvonnne was struck by a car shortly before Anne\u2019s birth. The doctors said that she was retarded and that she would probably never be able to speak. We hear in a biography of Richard Nixon [1] that \u201cthe de Gaulles were devastated.\" Madame De Gaulle wrote to a friend, \u201cCharles and I would give any- thing, health, all our money, advancement, career if only Anne could be an ordinary little girl like the rest\u201d. When someone suggested that they put her in a home, De Gaulle refused. \u201cShe did not ask to come into the world\u201d he said, \u201cWe should do everything to make her happy\u201d.\n\nAnne was born with Down\u2019s Syndrome [2] and in a time where disabled children were routinely sent to institutions, she lived with her family until her death. There was one sacred rule in the de Gaulle household: Anne was never to be made to feel different or less than anyone else. Charles de Gaulle was a quiet man, noted for his reserve and even with family members. He was usually not very demonstrative. His grandson once said on Radio 4 that his father would never be seen in the morning until he was fully dressed in military uniform.\n\nBut with his daughter Anne this all changed. She generated in him a warmth that he had seemed to be storing for his entire life just for her. He would dance little jigs for with her, do pantomimes, sing popular songs to her. During her brief life, he was the only person who could make her laugh.\n\nOne of de Gaulle\u2019s neighbours recalled how he used to walk with her hand-in-hand around the property, caressing her and talking quietly about the things she understood. She was, he said simply, \"My joy. She helped me overcome the failures in all men, and to look beyond them\u201d.\n\nThe de Gaulles fiercely protected Anne from the press and others. Her father forbade photographers from including any of his children in publicity shots taken at him home during the war years. He knew that the presence or absence of Anne would be sure to elicit comment. Other children teased her because she was different. But her pain was compounded because she did not know why she was different.\n\nIn 1948, Anne died of pneumonia, a month after her 20th birthday and died in her father's arms. At the conclusion of the brief graveside service, de Gaulle took his wife\u2019s hand and said \u201cCome, now she is like the others.\"\n\nOn 22 August 1962, Charles de Gaulle was the victim of an attempted assassination at Petit-Clamart. He later said that the potentially fatal bullet had been stopped by the frame of the photograph of Anne that he always carried with him, placed this particular day on the rear shelf of his car. When he died in 1970, he was buried in the cemetery of Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises beside his beloved daughter.\n\nAnne could only say one word clearly in her entire life: 'Papa'"}, {"url": "https://breakpoint.org/breakpoint-france-syndrome/", "page_content": "One of the great men of French history had a daughter with a disability. His faith saw him\u2014and her\u2014through.\n\nLate last year on BreakPoint, I told you about an extraordinary bit of censorship by the French government.\n\nWhat was censored was an ad featuring a smiling, happy child with Down syndrome. The ad, entitled \u201cDear Future Mom,\u201d told potential mothers about the joy and love that these children can and will bring into their lives.\n\nSo, why was it banned? Because the French government believes that the ad is \u201clikely to disturb the conscience of women\u201d who had aborted their babies after learning that the child had Down syndrome.\n\nNow I\u2019m going to tell you a story about a Frenchman who saw things very differently: Charles de Gaulle.\n\nYou probably weren\u2019t expecting to hear that. To most Americans, de Gaulle was, as one writer put it, \u201can obnoxious, overly ambitious man who, in the grand French manner, strutted sitting down.\u201d\n\nHe may have been some or all of these things, but there was a side of Charles de Gaulle that few people know about, and that side revolved around his love for his daughter, Anne.\n\nAnne was born on New Year\u2019s Day, 1928, the third of Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s three children. In De Gaulle\u2019s words, Anne was \u201cun enfant pas comme les autres,\u201d a child not like the other children.\n\nAs you\u2019ve probably guessed, Anne had Down syndrome. Only it wasn\u2019t called \u201cDown syndrome\u201d back then. The children were called \u201cmongoloids,\u201d and, as a recent story by Samuel Gregg of the Acton Institute in the Catholic World Report told readers, \u201cit was common [back then] for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care for them.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not something that de Gaulle and his family did. As de Gaulle put it, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d And so the family worked hard to make a place for Anne.\n\nWhile Yvonne worked on the logistics, Charles worked on the affection. You heard that right: the affection. Anne was the apple of his eye. As the article tells us, \u201cThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne.\u201d\n\nHe sang to her, read her stories, and taught her how to pray. Every night, Anne would \u201cpainstakingly . . . repeat each word after her father.\u201d In turn, de Gaulle would proudly tell his relatives that \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nAs Gregg tells readers, de Gaulle was well aware of how the Nazis treated children like Anne, and this, in turn, inspired his refusal to surrender to the Nazis. His \u201cact of resistance\u201d was a way of \u201csafeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\u201d As he later said, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d\n\nThe contrast between de Gaulle and his successors in the Elys\u00e9e Palace is almost too painful to contemplate. He refused to surrender to the Nazis to protect children with Down syndrome. After Anne\u2019s death, he and his wife established a foundation, staffed by nuns, to care for people \u201cwho are not like the others.\u201d\n\nDe Gaulle was a complicated man\u2014most great men are\u2014but one of his complications was his Catholic faith that enabled him to love Anne. It was a love that, as Gregg put it, helped restore France\u2019s honor, the same honor that was tarnished when, out of fear for hurting people\u2019s feelings, it denied the humanity of the people de Gaulle worked tirelessly to save.\n\nTo read Samuel Gregg\u2019s outstanding article, \u201cA Father\u2019s Love: The Story of Charles and Anne,\u201d please come to BreakPoint.org, click on this commentary, and we\u2019ll link you to it.\n\nFurther Reading and Information\n\nFrance and Down Syndrome: The French Government Should Learn from Charles DeGaulle\n\n\n\nRead the touching account of Charles de Gaulle and his great affection for his daughter Anne, born with Down syndrome.

Few know, however, how much strength he drew from his Down Syndrome daughter.\n\nWhen it comes to failed governments in our time, it\u2019s hard to ignore French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s administration. Hollande\u2019s record on basic issues like unemployment as well as his ineptness in the face of jihadist terrorism is so unimpressive that he declined to run for reelection. This, however, hasn\u2019t stopped his government from making the type of last-minute defiant gesture beloved of administrations whose days are numbered.\n\nIn Hollande\u2019s case, it has taken the form of effectively banning pro-life websites that don\u2019t explicitly identify themselves as pro-life. This follows a 2016 ruling by France\u2019s Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat endorsing a broadcasting tribunal\u2019s 2014 decision to prohibit a commercial portraying Down Syndrome children as joyful individuals loved by their parents because it might distress those who chose to terminate an unborn disabled child.\n\nReflecting upon these developments, I couldn\u2019t help thinking how much France owes to one particular Down Syndrome child: a young girl who struggled to speak, needed assistance to walk, and who died of pneumonia at the age of 20 cradled in her father\u2019s arms. Anne de Gaulle\u2019s father, however, was no ordinary man.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was surely the twentieth century\u2019s greatest Frenchman. Yet for all his achievements, the ultimate drama of de Gaulle\u2019s life was his helpless daughter. What Anne gave to him, however, was immeasurable. As de Gaulle confided to a priest at the beginning of his lonely crusade in 1940 to save France\u2019s honor, \u201cfor me, this child is a grace, she is my joy, she helps me to look beyond all the failures and honors, and always to look higher.\u201d\n\nUn enfant pas comme les autres\n\nCharles de Gaulle was an austere individual, one who consciously cultivated distance from others. 47 years after his death, however, we know much more about the private man. Thanks to the publication of memoirs, especially those of his son Admiral Philippe de Gaulle, the General emerges as a man who, like many French army officers of his background, found solace in his Catholic faith and a closely-knit family. We\u2019re also discovered that de Gaulle had a rich intellectual life which went far beyond politics. This went hand-in-hand with a wicked sense of humor which, in private, de Gaulle wasn\u2019t averse to using against himself.\n\nBy the time he reached his mid-30s, de Gaulle had settled into a milieu in which his faith, family and profession provided many of the certainties required for an ambitious man intent upon shaking up a political and military establishment committed to obsolete ideas. All this was shattered on 1 January 1928 when Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s third child was born. Within a few months, it became apparent that Anne was severely disabled.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this was an era in which disabled children were neither seen nor heard in polite company. Down Syndrome children were referred to as \u201cmongols.\u201d Some even speculated that the condition resulted from alcoholism or some form of impropriety on the parents\u2019 part. It wasn\u2019t until 30 years after Anne de Gaulle\u2019s birth that another devout French Catholic, Professor Jerome Lejeune, and his research team discovered that Down Syndrome was caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21.\n\nIn the 1930s, it was common for French families to place disabled children permanently in hospitals that were woefully ill-equipped to care them. Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle, however, refused to send Anne to live with, as he would say, \u201cstrangers.\u201d In de Gaulle\u2019s words, \u201cGod has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her, wherever she is and whatever she will be.\u201d In a way, de Gaulle\u2019s reaction to Anne\u2019s entry into his life foreshadowed the spirit of resistance expressed in his famous appeal of 18 June 1940 to Frenchmen to continue the war against Germany.\n\nThe de Gaulles worked hard to build a place for, to use de Gaulle\u2019s expression, \u201ca child who is not like the others\u201d in their family. From all accounts, Yvonne de Gaulle adopted a matter-of-fact approach. She focused on the practicalities of caring for a disabled child. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s contribution was to envelop Anne in a web of affection. According to his son, de Gaulle wanted to give Anne the assurance that he loved her just as much as her older brother and sister\u2014that her disability meant nothing to him.\n\nThe tall army officer infamous for his air of haughty disdain as leader of Free France during World War II and later as French President didn\u2019t hesitate to unbend to play on the floor with Anne. De Gaulle sang to Anne, told her stories, and even allowed her to play with one of his most treasured possessions: his officer\u2019s kepi hat. De Gaulle also said prayers with Anne in the evening. Painstakingly, she would repeat each word after her father. \u201cYou see,\u201d de Gaulle proudly informed his relatives, \u201cshe knows her prayers!\u201d\n\nWhen away on army business, de Gaulle constantly inquired about Anne\u2019s well-being. On one occasion, Anne had an operation while he was absent on maneuvers. De Gaulle telephoned incessantly to ask if she was in pain, whether the procedure had succeeded, what the doctors were saying, etc. Anne seems to have been aware of just how much she meant to her father. Her first governess recalled that Anne adored him and would be visibly upset when his responsibilities took de Gaulle away from his family.\n\nThough the de Gaulles valued their privacy, they didn\u2019t view Anne as an embarrassment. There are pictures of her standing awkwardly with members of the de Gaulles\u2019 extended family. Most striking, however, is a photo of Anne taken at a beach in Brittany in 1933. She is sitting on her father\u2019s lap. He, dressed in a homburg hat and three-piece suit, gently holds her hands as the five year-old girl looks intensely into her father\u2019s eyes. It\u2019s an image of unconditional love.\n\nWhile Anne lived, the de Gaulles took her everywhere with them. That included less-than-hospitable locations such as the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon. De Gaulle was posted there in 1929, partly because some of his superiors wanted to sideline an officer who asked awkward questions about France\u2019s readiness for the next war. There was, however, no question of leaving Anne behind. Instead she went with them, with the de Gaulles hiring a full-time governess to help them care for Anne in a Middle-Eastern country.\n\nFragility\u2014and Resistance\u2014in the face of Evil\n\nThere was, of course, a cost to all this. Though Charles de Gaulle came from a minor aristocratic family and his wife from an upper-middle class background, the de Gaulles were not wealthy. His modest army pay was their main source of income. Hiring full-time help was subsequently an enormous financial liability, but one they didn\u2019t hesitate to assume.\n\nThen there was the psychological burden. As Yvonne de Gaulle\u2019s biographer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Neau-Dufour observes, Yvonne was an exuberant, even care-free young woman before Anne was born. After Anne\u2019s birth, that woman gradually disappeared. Yvonne became a much quieter, even somewhat withdrawn person who dreaded public appearances. This, however, didn\u2019t stop her from undertaking the extremely difficult task of successfully fleeing France with the profoundly disabled Anne in tow as the German Army swept across the country in May and June 1940.\n\nThis brings into focus another factor of which Charles de Gaulle was undoubtedly aware: how the National Socialist regime treated the disabled. Eugenics was part and parcel of the Nazi view of the world (and most Western liberal opinion for decades). And, as the Nazis made clear right from the beginning, the disabled had no place in a National Socialist world. They were lebensunwertes leben (life unworthy of life).\n\nStarting in September 1939, the Nazi government began removing Down Syndrome children and infants suffering from other disabilities from their parents. These children were taken to \u201chealth facilities\u201d and killed by lethal injection or gas poisoning. In the name of \u201cracial health\u201d and other eugenics nonsense, the regime murdered thousands of disabled children. Among them was a 15 year-old Down Syndrome cousin of the future pope, Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nThis would have been Anne de Gaulle\u2019s fate if she had ever fallen into Nazi hands. Although de Gaulle never referenced it specifically, it\u2019s likely that the brutal treatment of the disabled was one of the things he had in mind when referring to the evil of the Nazi regime. When de Gaulle refused to surrender in 1940 and was branded a traitor by France\u2019s political and military elites, it was certainly the act of an intensely patriotic man unwilling to accept his country\u2019s abasement by the Nazis. But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. Noone, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petiteAnne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1970/11/11/archives/de-gaulle-rallied-france-in-war-and-strove-to-lead-her-to-greatness.html", "page_content": "\u201cYour reply is going to determine the destiny of France,\u201d an intense, solemn yet aged voice told the French people on April 25, 1969, \u201cbecause if I am disa vowed by the majority of you, my present task as chief of state would obviously become impossible [and] would im mediately stop exercising my functions.\u201d\n\nThat curiously aloof yet, paternal Voiae, which in 1940 had exhorted prostrate nation to rise from defeat and fight still against a merciless and omni present enemy, and which in the years after 1958 had rallied a country to grandeur and glory beyond her size and resources, had now lost the compelling eloquence that, less than a year earlier, had seemed invincible. Thus it was that two days after his appeal for confidence over a relatively minor, issue, Charles de Gaulle was repudiated by 53 per cent of the voters. And within 12 hours he departed the splendorous. Elysee Pal ace on the banks of the Seine in Paris; his residence for almost 11 years, for his plain home in the tiny village of Co lombey\u2010les\u2010Deux\u2010Eglises. More than the end of a singular political reign, it was the end of an era:\n\nThat era started virtually, unobserved on June 18, 1940, when an obscure tem porary brigadier general; having escaped to London from \u2018a battered and disorganized France about to capitulate to Nazi Germany, exhorted his country men to continue in a war that he per ceived would evolve into a world con flict.\n\n\u201cBut has the last word been said?\u201d the 49\u2010year\u2010old officer asked in his pun gent speech in a British Broadcasting Corporation studio. \u201cMust we abandon all hope?

But de Gaulle\u2019s act of resistance also concerned safeguarding his defenseless daughter from those who viewed her as sub-human.\n\nLife after Death\n\nLike many Down Syndrome children, Anne de Gaulle died at an early age. Her brother Philippe recollects arriving at his parents\u2019 house in 1948 to find the entire residence immersed in silence. No one, he writes, dared to say anything to his grief-stricken father. Anne was subsequently buried in the cemetery at the de Gaulles\u2019 parish church in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises. After attending their regular Sunday Mass and always on the anniversary of her death, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle would visit Anne\u2019s grave. 22 years after she died, her father was laid to rest beside Anne. Her mother joined them in 1979.\n\nThat, however, wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Back in October 1945, the de Gaulles raised enough money from private donors to buy the chateau de Vert-C\u0153ur in the department of Yvelines, not far from Paris. They then began creating a home for intellectually disabled girls. A few months after Anne\u2019s death, the Fondation Anne-de-Gaulle opened its doors at the chateau. Staffed by nuns, funded by the considerable royalties generated by de Gaulle\u2019s memoirs, and presided over by Yvonne de Gaulle until her death, the Foundation continues to serve the disabled today.\n\nOne of Charles de Gaulle\u2019s biographers, the late Jean Lacouture, records him as once saying, \u201cWithout Anne, I could never perhaps have done what I did. She gave me the heart and the inspiration.\u201d In that sense, the man of June 18 and his beloved pauvre petite Anne teach us something which we are tempted to forget\u2014that all of us can find strength in weakness and that nothing is more powerful than self-giving love.\n\n________________________________\n\nDr. Samuel Gregg is Research Director at the Acton Institute.

Churchill, in reference to de Gaulle, said that the heaviest cross he had to bear during the war was the Cross of Lorraine, the symbol of the Free French forces.\n\nArrogant, autocratic, often completely unreasonable, de Gaulle was all of these. However, there is no denying that he was also a great man. Rallying the Free French forces after the Nazi conquest of France, he boldly proclaimed, \u201cFrance has lost a battle, France has not lost the war.\u201d For more than a few Frenchmen and women, de Gaulle became the embodiment of France. It is also hard to dispute that De Gaulle is the greatest Frenchman since Clemenceau, \u201cThe Tiger\u201d, who led France to victory in World War I. However, de Gaulle was something more than a great man, he was also at bottom a good man, as demonstrated by his youngest daughter Anne de Gaulle.\n\nAnne de Gaulle Had Down Syndrome\n\nCharles and Yvonne de Gaulle were both devout Catholics, so when their youngest daughter Anne was born on New Years Day in 1928, they had a strong faith to fall back on when they learned that Anne had Down Syndrome. She also had birth injuries that meant that she would never walk unaided. There was never any question about Anne being institutionalized. She was a member of their family, and she stayed with the family in all their travels. There was one sacred rule in the de Gaulle household: Anne was never to be made to feel different or less than anyone else.\n\nCharles de Gaulle was noted for his reserve and even with family members he was usually not very demonstrative. Not so with his daughter Anne, who received a warmth that he had seemed to be storing for his entire life just for her. \u201cPapa\u201d was the one word that Anne could say clearly. He would sing to her, read her stories and play with her. She was, he said simply, \u201cMy joy\u201d. As de Gaulle said, \u201cShe helped me overcome the failures in all men, and to look beyond them.\u201d\n\nThe De Gaulles Were Heartbroken\n\nYvonne de Gaulle, a formidable woman in her own right, as she demonstrated after the collapse of France in 1940 when by herself she traveled across the war-torn country and made sure her family, including Anne, was on the last transport from Brest to England, in October 1945 bought the Ch\u00e2teau de Vert-C\u0153ur and established a hospital for handicapped girls, the Fondation Anne de Gaulle. The de Gaulles were heartbroken when their beloved daughter died on February 6, 1948, in her father\u2019s arms. After they had buried her, Charles gently told his weeping wife, \u201cMaintenant, elle est comme les autres.\u201d (Now, she\u2019s like all the others.)\n\nOf course , the de Gaulles did not forget their daughter. Charles de Gaulle\u2019s\u2019 life was saved by his love for Anne on August 22, 1962, when an assassin\u2019s bullet was deflected in the car he was riding by the frame of the picture of his daughter which he carried with him at all times. When he died in 1970 he was buried beside his daughter at Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises as he requested. Love gives us no guarantees against the tragedies of life, but it does give us the strength to surmount them."}, {"url": "https://www.parisaeroport.fr/en/group/group-news/paris-anne-de-gaulle", "page_content": "From Saturday 3 December to 10 December 2022, Paris-Charles de Gaulle airport gave way to Paris-Anne de Gaulle airport , in tribute to the daughter of Yvonne and General de Gaulle, Anne, who had a disability.

Charles de Gaulle led the Free French forces in resisting capitulation to Germany during World War II and became provisional president of France in the immediate aftermath of the war. Later he was an architect of the Fifth Republic and was president from 1959 to 1969. When did Charles de Gaulle become famous? Charles de Gaulle was undersecretary of state for defense and war when Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain took over the government of France with the intention of signing an armistice with Adolf Hitler. De Gaulle left for London, where, on June 18, 1940, he broadcast an appeal to his countrymen to continue to fight under his leadership. What were Charles de Gaulle\u2019s policies as president of France? Charles de Gaulle was determined that France should be treated as one of the great powers and not fall under the sway of any other country, particularly the United States. To that end, he made France a nuclear power, withdrew France from the military command of NATO, and followed his own views on foreign policy. When did Charles de Gaulle lose power? Charles de Gaulle lost power twice. He resigned as provisional president in 1946 because he opposed political parties forming the Fourth Republic, and, when his own movement failed to gain a majority, he retired from politics in 1953. The second time, voters rejected his proposed reforms, and he resigned as president in 1969.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, in full Charles Andr\u00e9 Joseph Marie de Gaulle, (born November 22, 1890, Lille, France\u2014died November 9, 1970, Colombey-les-deux-\u00c9glises), French soldier, writer, statesman, and architect of France\u2019s Fifth Republic.\n\nEducation and early career De Gaulle was the second son of a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-class family. The family had produced historians and writers, and his father taught philosophy and literature; but, as a boy, de Gaulle already showed a passionate interest in military matters. He attended the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr, and in 1913, as a young second lieutenant, he joined an infantry regiment commanded by Colonel Philippe P\u00e9tain. De Gaulle was an intelligent, hardworking, and zealous young soldier and, in his military career, a man of original mind, great self-assurance, and outstanding courage. In World War I he fought at Verdun, was three times wounded and three times mentioned in dispatches, and spent two years and eight months as a prisoner of war (during which time he made five unsuccessful attempts to escape). After a brief visit to Poland as a member of a military mission, a year\u2019s teaching at Saint-Cyr, and a two-year course of special training in strategy and tactics at the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Guerre (War College), he was promoted by Marshal P\u00e9tain in 1925 to the staff of the Supreme War Council. From 1927 to 1929 de Gaulle served as a major in the army occupying the Rhineland and could see for himself both the potential danger of German aggression and the inadequacy of the French defense. He also spent two years in the Middle East and then, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, spent four years as a member of the secretariat of the National Defense Council. De Gaulle\u2019s writing career began with a study of the relations between the civil and military powers in Germany (La Discorde chez l\u2019ennemi, 1924; \u201cDiscord Among the Enemy\u201d), followed by lectures on his conception of leadership, Le Fil de l\u2019\u00e9p\u00e9e (1932; The Edge of the Sword). A study on military theory, Vers l\u2019arm\u00e9e de m\u00e9tier (1934; The Army of the Future), defended the idea of a small professional army, highly mechanized and mobile, in preference to the static theories exemplified by the Maginot Line, which was intended to protect France against German attack. He also wrote a memorandum in which he tried, even as late as January 1940, to convert politicians to his way of thinking. His views made him unpopular with his military superiors, and the question of his right to publish under his name a historical study, La France et son arm\u00e9e (1938; France and Her Army), led to a dispute with Marshal P\u00e9tain. Britannica Quiz Pop Quiz: 17 Things to Know About World War II\n\nWorld War II At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle commanded a tank brigade attached to the French Fifth Army. In May 1940, after assuming command as temporary brigadier general in the 4th Armoured Division\u2014the rank that he retained for the rest of his life\u2014he twice had the opportunity to apply his theories on tank warfare. He was mentioned as \u201can admirable, energetic, and courageous leader.\u201d On June 6 he entered the government of Paul Reynaud as undersecretary of state for defense and war, and he undertook several missions to England to explore the possibilities of continuing the war. When the Reynaud government was replaced 10 days later by that of Marshal P\u00e9tain, who intended to seek an armistice with the Germans, de Gaulle left for England. On June 18 he broadcast from London his first appeal to his compatriots to continue the war under his leadership. On August 2, 1940, a French military court tried and sentenced him in absentia to death, deprivation of military rank, and confiscation of property. De Gaulle entered his wartime career as a political leader with tremendous liabilities. He had only a handful of haphazardly recruited political supporters and volunteers for what were to become the Free French Forces. He had no political status and was virtually unknown in both Britain and France. But he had an absolute belief in his mission and a conviction that he possessed the qualities of leadership. He was totally devoted to France and had the strength of character (or obstinacy, as it often appeared to the British) to fight for French interests as he saw them with all the resources at his disposal.

Broadcasts from London, the action of the Free French Forces, and the contacts of resistance groups in France either with de Gaulle\u2019s own organization or with those of the British secret services brought national recognition of his leadership; but full recognition by his allies came only after the liberation of Paris in August 1944. Henri Giraud, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle, and Winston Churchill; Casablanca Conference In London de Gaulle\u2019s relations with the British government were never easy, and de Gaulle often added to the strain, at times through his own misjudgment or touchiness. In 1943 he moved his headquarters to Algiers, where he became president of the French Committee of National Liberation, at first jointly with General Henri Giraud. De Gaulle\u2019s successful campaign to edge out Giraud gave the world proof of his skill in political maneuvering."}]}
