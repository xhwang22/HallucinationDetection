Two months later he volunteered for the army as a pilot, serving in France, where he was officially credited with having brought down four German warplanes. Following his discharge of February 5, 1919, Germer was given a medical examination and was treated for shock and nervous strain. On March 1, 1919, Germer returned to his position at Western Electric and was assigned to work with Dr. Clinton J. Davisson, an electron physicist who was doing research on a reliable, distortionless repeater, or amplifier, for use in the long-distance telephone lines of AT&T. While studying the effect of positive ion bombardment on the efficiency of electron emission for oxide coated cathodes, Davisson and Germer noted that electrons directed at metal targets were reflected without loss of energy, a surprising result. While Davisson and a newly appointed colleague, Charles Kunsman, began to pursue studies with the elastically scattered electrons, Germer was assigned to a new project on thermionic emission. He and Davisson published important results on this topic in 1922, and in 1924 Germer published the results of further studies as his Ph. D. dissertation. Germer's hectic schedule (work, graduate school, and raising a family) was interrupted from April 1923 to July 1924, during which time he was treated for a nervous breakdown probably linked to a severe, recurrent sinus infection that was aggravated by noxious gas overseas. Shortly after Germer returned to work in 1924, he was reassigned to the electron scattering studies that had been assigned to Kunsman in 1920 but had been abandoned in late 1923, at which time Kunsman left the company. On February 5, 1925, while the electron tube previously used by Davisson and Kunsman was being reactivated, an accident occurred that eventually changed the character of the investigation. The heated, evacuated tube cracked, the nickel target was damaged, and the experiments were halted. When the tube was repaired and the experiments resumed, a surprisingly different pattern of the scattered electrons was observed. Attempts to explain this new behavior on the basis of the altered crystal structure of the nickel target were inconclusive, and Davisson and Germer expanded their study. Two years later, after further experimentation and after Davisson had obtained new theoretical insights during a trip to England and attendance at the 1926 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Davisson and Germer realized that the new behavior of the scattered electrons could best be understood by attributing wave properties to them. In a series of papers published by Davisson and Germer, both jointly and separately, during the period 1927-1929, they demonstrated conclusively that electrons, like light, have the physical characteristics of waves as well as particles. Davisson and Germer realized that their discovery also had potential for yielding information about the structure of the material from which the electrons were scattered. Germer pursued these studies, using both the scattering method he and Davisson had developed, and also an electron transmission method developed by George P. Thomson in England, publishing over twenty papers in the field. At that time he developed an interest in the behavior of metal contacts under electrical discharge, another subject of interest to AT&T, which he pursued until 1957, publishing nearly twenty papers on this topic. Having completed this long series of studies, Germer's interest in electron diffraction was rekindled when a colleague at Bell Telephone Laboratories asked him to assist in developing a modified form of the electron scattering apparatus he and Davisson had used thirty years earlier. After Germer and his colleagues perfected this method, it proved to be so fruitful for the investigation of surface structures that Germer, even after his retirement from Bell Labs in 1961, continued this work as a research associate at Cornell University. During this time, besides publishing the results of his own research, he traveled to locations all over the world, lecturing and giving advice on the technique and interpretation of low-energy electron diffraction studies (LEED), a technique that has become indispensable to many fields of research. He died after a fall while climbing near Gardiner, New York."}, {"url": "https://new.nsf.gov/od/honorary-awards/national-medal-of-science", "page_content": "The drop down items below will help you with the nomination process.\n\nInformational Webinar to be held on March 21, 2023\n\nPlease join us for an informational webinar about the National Medal of Science and the 2023 Call for Nominations.

The tips are meant to help you prepare a package that will enable the Committee to evaluate how well the nominee meets the Award Selection Considerations.\n\n\n\n1. The PCNMS has the challenge of selecting a small set of candidates for consideration by the White House, from a (typically) large number of nominations. Virtually all the nominees are leaders in science and the PCNMS is faced with the difficult task of determining who among the nominees should be recommended for consideration. The quality of the nomination package can profoundly impact the PCNMS\u2019 ability to properly assess a nominee. Nominators should invest the time to craft a nomination that clearly sets out the nominee\u2019s impact, achievements, and service to their field and to the nation.\n\n\n\n2. As described in the Overview, the disciplines represented by the award cover a wide range of subject-matters. One consequence is that some nominees may specialize in an area of science not well-represented on the PCNMS. Nominators should write the nomination to be straightforwardly understood by scientists who are not necessarily experts in the nominee\u2019s discipline.\n\n\n\n3. The National Medal of Science is a national award. Furthermore, laureates of the National Medal of Science can have a strong impact on advancing and strengthening the diversity of the science and engineering enterprise in the United States. The PCNMS looks for the nomination to demonstrate significant positive impact on the United States that can reasonably be attributed to the nominee.\n\n\n\n4. The National Medal of Science represents a cumulative achievement award for the candidate, rather than an award for a specific discovery or action. It may be useful to have the narrative statement and letters of reference address different aspects of the nominee\u2019s accomplishments to convey the broad scope of the nominee\u2019s contributions to science and society.\n\n\n\n5. Nominations should highlight accomplishments across the span of the candidate\u2019s career to date. If significant accomplishments include co-discovery or team accomplishments, the committee suggests that one or more of the reference letters be from a collaborator on the significant accomplishment(s).\n\nNomination form description"}, {"url": "https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/medalofscience50/nirenberg.jsp", "page_content": "Marshall Nirenberg (1927-2010)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun to discover things, and it\u2019s important to discover things.\u201d\n\n\u2013Marshall Nirenberg\n\nNational Medal of Science (NMS) recipient in 1964 \u201cfor studies of the genetic control of protein synthesis and, in particular, for deciphering the chemical code relating nucleic acid structures to protein structures.\u201d\n\nMarshall Nirenberg was born in New York City, but after developing rheumatic fever as a teenager, his family moved to Orlando, Fla., for the subtropical climate. In high school, Nirenberg enjoyed exploring the \u201cnatural paradise\u201d of Florida, and kept detailed journals documenting his observations of local flora and fauna.\n\nNirenberg became interested in biochemistry while pursuing his undergraduate and master\u2019s degrees at the University of Florida. After receiving his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 1957, he began his career at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where he studied the relationship between RNA, DNA and protein production. In 1961, Nirenberg and his assistant, J. Heinrich Matthaei, made the groundbreaking discovery that RNA is the director of protein synthesis.\n\nThough very few people attended Nirenberg\u2019s talk on this finding at the International Congress of Biochemistry in Moscow in 1961, the celebrated biologist Francis Crick was in attendence, and arranged for him to give the presentation a second time. In his repeat performance, more than 1,000 people attended and news of his discovery turned Nirenberg into an overnight celebrity.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported: \u201cNo stronger proof of the universality of all life has been developed since Charles Darwin\u2019s \u2018The Origin of Species\u2019 demonstrated that all life is descended from one beginning.\u201d\n\nFollowing the announcement that Nirenberg had \u201ccracked\u2019 the genetic code, a race ensued to decipher the codons, or \u201ccode words,\u201d of messenger RNA for all 20 amino acids. Despite competing against better-known, better-funded laboratories, Nirenberg succeeded in being the first to identify all 63 codons in the genetic code. For this achievement, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1968.\n\nFollowing this achievement, Nirenberg turned to the field of neurobiology, where he used his knowledge of information processing to explore the workings of the brain. He pursued the topic for three decades, making significant contributions to cancer research and public health.\n\nThroughout his career, Nirenberg expressed a commitment to practicing socially responsible science. In 1966, he quoted virologist Salvador Luria, who said that \u201cthe impact of science on human affairs imposes on its practitioners an inescapable responsibility.\u201d Nirenberg was vocal about political, social and humanitarian issues, speaking out on subjects ranging from world hunger to nuclear war to stem cell research.\n\nUpon Nirenberg\u2019s death in 2010, Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health and fellow NMS recipient, called him \u201cone of science's great titans.\u201d He was predeceased by his wife of 40 years, Perola Zaltzman Nirenberg.
