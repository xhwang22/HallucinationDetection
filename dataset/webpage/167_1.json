{"Raymond Harry Brown is best known for his invention of the Brown Box, the first commercial video game console.": [{"url": "https://www.history.com/topics/inventions/history-of-video-games", "page_content": "Today, video games make up a $100 billion global industry, and nearly two-thirds of American homes have household members who play video games regularly. And it\u2019s really no wonder: Video games have been around for decades and span the gamut of platforms, from arcade systems, to home consoles, to handheld consoles and mobile devices. They\u2019re also often at the forefront of computer technology.\n\nThe Early Days\n\nThough video games are found today in homes worldwide, they actually got their start in the research labs of scientists.\n\nIn 1952, for instance, British professor A.S. Douglas created OXO, also known as noughts and crosses or a tic-tac-toe, as part of his doctoral dissertation at the University of Cambridge. And in 1958, William Higinbotham created Tennis for Two on a large analog computer and connected oscilloscope screen for the annual visitor\u2019s day at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York.\n\nIn 1962, Steve Russell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology invented Spacewar!, a computer-based space combat video game for the PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor-1), then a cutting-edge computer mostly found at universities. It was the first video game that could be played on multiple computer installations.\n\nHISTORY Vault: Game Changers: Inside the Video Game Wars Brought to life by Academy Award-winning director Daniel Junge, this is the untold story of the personal battles that gave rise to the multibillion-dollar video game industry. WATCH NOW\n\nDawn of the Home Console\n\nIn 1967, developers at Sanders Associates, Inc., led by Ralph Baer, invented a prototype multiplayer, multi-program video game system that could be played on a television. It was known as \u201cThe Brown Box.\u201d\n\nBaer, who\u2019s sometimes referred to as Father of Video Games, licensed his device to Magnavox, which sold the system to consumers as the Odyssey, the first video game home console, in 1972. Over the next few years, the primitive Odyssey console would commercially fizzle and die out.\n\nYet, one of the Odyssey\u2019s 28 games was the inspiration for Atari\u2019s Pong, the first arcade video game, which the company released in 1972. In 1975, Atari released a home version of Pong, which was as successful as its arcade counterpart.\n\nMagnavox, along with Sanders Associates, would eventually sue Atari for copyright infringement. Atari settled and became an Odyssey licensee; over the next 20 years, Magnavox went on to win more than $100 million in copyright lawsuits related to the Odyssey and its video game patents.\n\nIn 1977, Atari released the Atari 2600 (also known as the Video Computer System), a home console that featured joysticks and interchangeable game cartridges that played multi-colored games, effectively kicking off the second generation of the video game consoles.\n\nThe video game industry had a few notable milestones in the late 1970s and early 1980s, including:\n\nThe release of the Space Invaders arcade game in 1978\n\nThe launch of Activision, the first third-party game developer (which develops software without making consoles or arcade cabinets), in 1979\n\nThe introduction to the United States of Japan\u2019s hugely popular Pac-Man\n\nNintendo\u2019s creation of Donkey Kong, which introduced the world to the character Mario\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s release of its first Flight Simulator game\n\nThe Video Game Crash\n\nIn 1983, the North American video game industry experienced a major \u201ccrash\u201d due to a number of factors, including an oversaturated game console market, competition from computer gaming, and a surplus of over-hyped, low-quality games, such as the infamous E.T., an Atari game based on the eponymous movie and often considered the worst game ever created.\n\nLasting a couple of years, the crash led to the bankruptcy of several home computer and video game console companies.\n\nThe video game home industry began to recover in 1985 when the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), called Famicom in Japan, came to the United States. The NES had improved 8-bit graphics, colors, sound and gameplay over previous consoles.\n\nNintendo, a Japanese company that began as a playing card manufacturer in 1889, released a number of important video game franchises still around today, such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, and Metroid.\n\nAdditionally, Nintendo imposed various regulations on third-party games developed for its system, helping to combat rushed, low-quality software. Third-party developers released many other long-lasting franchises, such as Capcom\u2019s Mega Man, Konami\u2019s Castlevania, Square\u2019s Final Fantasy, and Enix\u2019s Dragon Quest (Square and Enix would later merge to form Square Enix in 2003).\n\nIn 1989, Nintendo made waves again by popularizing handheld gaming with the release of its 8-bit Game Boy video game device and the often-bundled game Tetris. Over the next 25 years, Nintendo would release a number of successful successors to the Game Boy, including the Game Boy color in 1998, Nintendo DS in 2004, and Nintendo 3DS in 2011.\n\nThe First Console War\n\nAlso in 1989, Sega released its 16-bit Genesis console in North America as a successor to its 1986 Sega Master System, which failed to adequately compete against the NES.\n\nWith its technological superiority to the NES, clever marketing, and the 1991 release of the Sonic the Hedgehog game, the Genesis made significant headway against its older rival. In 1991, Nintendo released its 16-bit Super NES console in North America, launching the first real \u201cconsole war.\u201d\n\nThe early- to mid-1990s saw the release of a wealth of popular games on both consoles, including new franchises such as Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat, a fighting game that depicted blood and gore on the Genesis version of the game.\n\nIn response to the violent game (as well as congressional hearings about violent video games), Sega created the Videogame Rating Council in 1993 to provide descriptive labeling for every game sold on a Sega home console. The council later gives rise to the industry-wide Entertainment Software Rating Board, which is still used today to rate video games based on content.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, video games leaped to the Big Screen with the release of the Super Mario Bros. live-action movie in 1993, followed by Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat over the next two years. Numerous movies based on video games have been released since.\n\nWith a much larger library of games, lower price point, and successful marketing, the Genesis had leapfrogged ahead of the SNES in North America by this time. But Sega was unable to find similar success in Japan.\n\nThe Rise of 3D Gaming\n\nWith a leap in computer technology, the fifth generation of video games ushered in the three-dimensional era of gaming.\n\nIn 1995, Sega released in North America its Saturn system, the first 32-bit console that played games on CDs rather than cartridges, five months ahead of schedule. This move was to beat Sony\u2019s first foray into video games, the Playstation, which sold for $100 less than the Saturn when it launched later that year. The following year, Nintendo released its cartridge-based 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64.\n\nThough Sega and Nintendo each released their fair share of highly-rated, on-brand 3D titles, such as Virtua Fighter on the Saturn and Super Mario 64 on the Nintendo 64, the established video game companies couldn\u2019t compete with Sony\u2019s strong third-party support, which helped the Playstation secure numerous exclusive titles.\n\nSimply put: Sony dominated the video game market and would continue to do so into the next generation. In fact, the Playstation 2, released in 2000 and able to play original Playstation games, would become the best-selling game console of all time.\n\nThe Playstation 2, which was the first console that used DVDs, went up against the Sega Dreamcast (released in 1999), the Nintendo Gamecube (2001), and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox (2001).\n\nThe Dreamcast\u2014considered by many to be ahead of its time and one of the greatest consoles ever made for several reasons, including its capability for online gaming\u2014was a commercial flop that ended Sega\u2019s console efforts. Sega pulled the plug on the system in 2001, becoming a third-party software company henceforth.\n\nModern Age of Gaming\n\nIn 2005 and 2006, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox 360, Sony\u2019s Playstation 3, and Nintendo\u2019s Wii kicked off the modern age of high-definition gaming. Though the Playstation 3\u2014the only system at the time to play Blu-rays\u2014was successful in its own right, Sony, for the first time, faced stiff competition from its rivals.\n\nThe Xbox 360, which had similar graphics capabilities to the Playstation 3, was lauded for its online gaming ecosystem and won far more Game Critics Awards than the other platforms in 2007; it also featured the Microsoft Kinect, a state-of-the-art motion capture system that offered a different way to play video games (though the Kinect never caught on with core gamers or game developers).\n\nAnd despite being technologically inferior to the other two systems, the Wii trounced its competition in sales. Its motion-sensitive remotes made gaming more active than ever before, helping it appeal to a much larger slice of the general public, including people in retirement homes.\n\nTowards the end of the decade and beginning of the next, video games spread to social media platforms like Facebook and mobile devices like the iPhone, reaching a more casual gaming audience. Rovio, the company behind the Angry Birds mobile device game (and, later Angry Birds animated movie), reportedly made a whopping $200 million in 2012.\n\nIn 2011, Skylanders: Spyro\u2019s Adventure brought video games into the physical world. The game required players to place plastic toy figures (sold separately) onto an accessory, which reads the toys\u2019 NFC tags to bring the characters into the game. The next few years would see several sequels and other toy-video game hybrids, such as Disney Infinity, which features Disney characters.\n\nThe 8th generation of video games began with the release of Nintendo\u2019s Wii U in 2012, followed by the Playstation 4 and Xbox One in 2013. Despite featuring a touch screen remote control that allowed off-TV gaming and being able to play Wii games, the Wii U was a commercial failure\u2014the opposite of its competition\u2014and was discontinued in 2017.\n\nIn early 2017, Nintendo released its Wii U successor, the Nintendo Switch, the only system to allow both television-based and handheld gaming. Microsoft released its 4K-ready console, the Xbox One X, in late 2017, and followed up in 2020 with the Xbox Series X and Series S. In 2020, Sony released the Playstation 5, a successor to Playstation 4.\n\nWith their new revamped consoles, both Sony and Microsoft currently have their sights set on virtual reality gaming, a technology that has the potential to change the way players experience video games.\n\nSources\n\n\u2018Spacewar!\u2019 The story of the world\u2019s first digital video game.

Vacuum tube circuit produced two-spot display, game used joystick. People able to play a \"chase' game on the set, with one 'player's dot trying to 'catch' the other player's.\n\n3) Also known as \"Fox and hound\" chase game was demonstrated to Sanders corporate director of research and development, Herb Chapman. The demonstration was a success, and shortly thereafter the project was granted the sum of $2 500 to maintain it. Project was unofficial.\n\n4) Console uses a type of removable printed circuit board, called a game card, that inserts into a slot similar to a ROM cartridge slot. The game cards do not contain any components, but have a series of \"jumpers\" \u2014 simple electrical connections \u2014 between pins of the card connector. These jumpers interconnect different logic and signal generators in the console to produce the desired game logic and screen output.\n\n5) In late 1967 the \"Chase\" game got a machine-controlled third dot, as well as compatibility with the first ever \u2018light-gun\u2019 peripheral. Bauer create first light gun and developed several video games. First gun for a home console was in fact a big rifle.\n\n6) A video game console is a device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game. The term \"video game console\" is used to distinguish a console machine primarily designed for consumers to use for playing video games in contrast to arcade machines or home computers. It includes home video game consoles, handheld game consoles, microconsoles and dedicated consoles.\n\n7) Light gun is a pointing device for computers and a control device for arcade and video games, shaped as a pistol. Modern screen-based light guns work by building an optical sensor into the gun, which receives its input from the light emitted by on-screen target(s). The first device of this type, the light pen, was used on the MIT Whirlwind computer. First ever mechanical light gun game was arcade game \"Seeburg Ray-O-Lite\" (1936).\n\n8) First official prototype of a console plays game of \"Ping Pong\" (it inspired arcade game Pong (1972).\n\n9) Game is not emulated."}, {"url": "https://www.studyquestions.org/what/what-was-the-brown-box-and-who-created-it/", "page_content": "What was the brown box and who created it?\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n\n34\n\nWhat was the brown box and who created it?\n\nBetween 1967 and 1969, he and colleagues Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch created several video game test units.

After his family was sold, Brown committed himself to escaping from bondage. He had himself shipped in a wooden box from Virginia to Philadelphia, where slavery had been abolished. Brown was subsequently the subject of a popular slave narrative, which he adapted into a stage show. The details of his death are unknown.\n\nEarly Life and Family\n\nHenry \"Box\" Brown was born enslaved in Louisa County, Virginia, in 1815. The precise date of his birth is unknown. At the age of 15, he was sent to Richmond to work in a tobacco factory. Although he married and had four children, he was unable to live with his family. In 1848, his wife and children were sold to a plantation in North Carolina. This tremendous loss fueled Brown's fervor to escape from slavery.\n\nEscape from Slavery\n\nBrown, an active member of a local church, enlisted fellow parishioner James Caesar Anthony Smith and a white contact, Samuel Smith, to aid him in his escape. Brown's plan was to have himself shipped as cargo from Richmond to Philadelphia, where slavery had been abolished.\n\nSamuel Smith shipped a box containing Brown by Adams Express Company on March 23, 1849. The box, labeled \"dry goods,\" was lined with cloth and had a single hole cut in the top for air. 27 hours later, the box arrived at the headquarters of the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society. Emerging from the box, Brown recited a psalm.\n\nCareer as a Performer\n\nFollowing Brown's successful escape, Samuel Smith attempted to ship more enslaved people from Richmond to Philadelphia on May 8, 1849. His plan was discovered, however, and he was subsequently arrested. James Caesar Anthony Smith was also arrested on similar charges, though he did not serve time.\n\nGiven the dangers of making Brown's escape public, some abolitionist leaders \u2014 including Frederick Douglass \u2014 argued that it should be kept confidential. Others argued that the story would inspire other innovative and daring escapes. Brown made the decision to publicize his experience. Shortly after his escape, Brown appeared before the New England Anti-Slavery Society Convention in Boston. He subsequently toured the region performing his story. Boston publisher Charles Sterns also published a version of the story, which would become one of the best-known slave narratives in American history.\n\nBrown again developed his stage show to include a panorama on the institution of slavery. In 1850, the \"Mirror of Slavery\" show opened in Boston. After passage of the Fugitive Slave Act later that year, Brown moved to England with his panorama. He remained in England for the next quarter-century, marrying and fathering a daughter despite criticism that he should purchase the freedom of his first wife and four children.\n\nIn 1875, Brown returned to the United States with his English wife and child. He performed as a magician to make a living. As part of his stage act, he emerged from the original box in which he had traveled to freedom.\n\nLater Life\n\nBrown's last recorded performance took place in Ontario, Canada, on February 26, 1889.

Much of what we know about him comes from his memoir, the Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself (1851).\n\nBrown was born enslaved in 1816 at the Hermitage plantation near present-day Cuckoo, Virginia. Brown recalled a memory of his childhood when the plantation owner, John Barret, told him and his siblings \u201cAll you children run into the house now, for its going to thunder.\u201d The children ran for shelter, and the rain began. Not realizing Barret saw the rain clouds coming from a distance, Brown believed Barret had the ability to conjure rain until he was eight years old.\n\nBrown learned his first sleight-of-hand tricks around the age of nine from a man enslaved on the same plantation. This man, known as Tricky Sam, informally performed the tricks as a way of entertaining each other.\n\nHenry Brown eventually married a woman named Nancy, who was enslaved at a nearby plantation. They had four children together before they were forcibly separated. Angry and vowing to escape, Brown later said \u201cI felt my soul call out to Heaven to breathe a prayer to Almighty God.\u201d And then, in response, he heard a voice say \u201cGo get a box, and put yourself in it.\u201d\n\nFrom this, Henry Brown developed a plan to have himself mailed as freight to a free state. With the help of a carpenter named Samuel Smith, they built a box three feet long, two feet wide, and two-and-a-half feet tall with three small air holes and lined with a woolen felt cloth. On March 29, 1849, Brown climbed into the finished box with a small container of water, a few biscuits, and a tool for poking additional air holes in the box if needed. The crate was closed and addressed to William Johnson, a barber in Philadelphia who was an operator in the Underground Railroad.\n\nA note was added to the box indicating \u201cRight side up with care.\u201d Despite this caution, the box was roughly handled by the Adams Express company on its way from Richmond, Virginia to Philadelphia. The box arrived a day later, and a small gathering of abolitionists were in attendance. Worried that Brown had died en route, one of the members present knocked on the box and asked, \u201cAll right?\u201d to which Brown immediately responded, \u201cAll right, sir.\u201d The lid was quickly removed, and Brown stepped out of the box and into freedom for the first time in his life. From that moment, he was known as Henry \u201cBox\u201d Brown.\n\nFearing bounty hunters, Brown soon left Philadelphia for New Bedford and Boston where he began speaking at public rallies about his life in Virginia and his escape. His story appeared in several major publications and Brown quickly became a leading voice within the abolitionist movement. He supported himself through the speaking fees charged at the rallies and lectures.\n\nBrown toured across the northeast until the enactment of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850 which made it easier for those who escaped enslavement to be captured and returned to the South. After he narrowly avoided capture in Providence, Rhode Island in August, 1850, Brown left the United States for England and began touring there. To garner publicity for his talks, Brown had himself shipped from Bradford to Leeds in a box that was opened in front of a large audience.\n\nBrown was still touring England in 1865 when slavery was constitutionally abolished in the United States. He adapted his touring program, continuing to tell the story of his escape while also presenting magic tricks.\n\nUnfortunately, Brown was never reunited with his wife and children. He remarried in England in 1855 and he and his new wife, Jane Floyd, started a family together. Jane and their children would eventually join Henry on stage as performers in his magic act.\n\nEngland was experiencing a new golden age in the performance of magic at this time, and Brown began teaching himself tricks that had been exposed by the press, including the popular spirit cabinet trick performed by the famous Davenport Brothers. In this trick, a member of the audience would tie the performer to a chair in one side of the cabinet. Various musical instruments would be placed in the other side of the cabinet. The doors would be closed, and the instruments could be heard and other surprising acts of spiritualism would be witnessed. Opening the doors, the performer would be seen still tied to the chair. Brown learned the spirit cabinet trick in order to show audiences how it was done.\n\nMagic featured more and more prominently in Brown\u2019s public appearances over the years, and around 1875 he returned to the United States and continued touring there. Illusionist and collector Harry Houdini acquired and saved a number of the original playbills and tickets for Brown\u2019s performances in his collection, which came to the Ransom Center in 1958. These rare pieces of ephemera provide valuable insights into the content of Brown\u2019s performances.\n\nA playbill from the Horns Assembly Rooms in Kennington, England from March, 1868 hails Brown as \u201cKing of all Mesmerisers and Professor of Magic.\u201d The program also suggests that in addition to sleight-of-hand tricks, he was performing \u2018electro-biology\u2019 tricks \u2013 a subgenre of hypnotism. Tickets for these performances in Kennington reveal that the presents given away each night of the performance included \u201ccoffee pots, tea pots, brooches, scarf pins, wedding rings, silver spoons, etc.\u201d Give-aways such as these were enormously popular marketing techniques for variety performances in England and the United States, especially effective in drawing women and families to shows at a time when theatre could sometimes be seen as crass or morally dangerous.\n\nA later playbill from Harris\u2019 Hall in Woonsocket, Rhode Island dated February 8, 1878 shows how Brown\u2019s act developed in complexity over the previous decade. Billed as a professor, and performing at a relatively early 5pm for schools, Brown\u2019s program consisted of:\n\nDestroying and restoring a Handkerchief, astounding feat with the Sword and Cards, the wonderful Flying Card and Box Feat, Burning Cards and Restoring them again, the most Wonderful and Mysterious Doll, the Inexhaustible Hats, the wonderful experiment of passing a Watch through a number of Boxes, the extraordinary feat of Flying Money, the Inexhaustible Pan, the instantaneous Growth of Flowers, the Enchanted Glass, etc., etc.\n\nThe playbill notes that Mr. Brown will be exposing spiritualism tricks, presumably performing the Davenport Brothers cabinet trick. His wife, \u201cMadame Brown,\u201d introduced Henry Brown\u2019s second-sight trick, and the performance concluded with their daughter, Annie Brown, performing the early sack escape trick.\n\nEphemera like this is exceedingly rare. Much of what is known about Brown and his magic act comes from contemporary newspaper accounts, which suggest that he and his family continued performing until at least 1889.\n\nHenry \u201cBox\u201d Brown is largely remembered today for his extraordinary escape narrative, but lately more attention is being given to his later career as an acclaimed stage magician.

Brown subsequently joined the abolitionist movement as a public speaker and performer and later became an entertainer. After his escape, Brown attended the New England Anti-Slavery Convention, where he was jokingly introduced as \u201cBoxer.\u201d He was thereafter fondly known among abolitionists as Henry (\u201cBox\u201d) Brown.\n\nBrown and his immediate family\u2014his parents and seven siblings (three brothers and four sisters)\u2014were all enslaved on a tobacco plantation near Richmond, Virginia. When their owner died, the family was divided among several slaveholders. Brown, then about 15 years old, was sent to work in a tobacco factory in Richmond. There Brown attended the First African Baptist Church, where he met and married a woman named Nancy, who was enslaved at a nearby plantation. The couple had three children before 1848, when Nancy\u2019s abusive owner sold her and their children to an enslaver in North Carolina. Nancy was pregnant with the couple\u2019s fourth child. Brown was devastated by the sale and vowed to escape from the cruelties of slavery.\n\nBrown eventually asked a friend, James C.A. Smith, Jr., a free Black man, to help him escape to the North. Smith agreed to pay for the assistance of a Massachusetts-born white man, Samuel Smith. With James Smith, Brown conceived a plan in which he would hide in a wooden crate that would be sent to Pennsylvania, where slavery was virtually nonexistent. Samuel Smith arranged for the leader of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, James Miller McKim, to take possession of the crate in Philadelphia.\n\nOn March 23, 1849, Brown crawled into a crate that was approximately 3 feet (1 metre) long, 2.5 feet (0.8 metre) deep, and 2 feet (0.6 metre) wide. The crate had three holes in it through which Brown was able to breathe. Samuel Smith took the crate to a shipping company and sent it to Philadelphia as dry goods. The crate traveled by wagon, steamboat, and railroad. Brown had an uncomfortable journey of 27 hours before McKim freed him at the office of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society. Upon his emergence Brown sang a hymn that he had prepared for his release, based on Psalm 40 of the Old Testament\u2019s book of Psalms:\n\n\n\nAnd he\n\nI waited patiently, I waited patiently for the Lord,\n\nAnd he inclined unto me, and heard my calling:\n\nAnd he hath put a new song in my mouth,\n\nEven a thanksgiving, even a thanksgiving, even a thanksgiving unto our God.\n\nBlessed, Blessed, Blessed, Blessed is the man, Blessed is the man,\n\nBlessed is the man that hath set his hope, his hope in the Lord;\n\nO Lord my God, Great, Great, Great,\n\nGreat are the wondrous works which thou hast done.\n\nGreat are the wondrous works which thou hast done, which thou hast done:\n\nIf I should declare them and speak of them, they would be more, more, more than I am able to express.\n\nI have not kept back thy loving kindness and truth from the great\n\nI have not kept back thy loving kindness and truth from the great congregation.\n\nWithdraw not thou thy mercy from me,\n\nWithdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord;\n\nLet thy loving kindness and thy truth always preserve me,\n\nLet all those that seek thee be joyful and glad,\n\nLet all those that seek thee be joyful and glad, be joyful, and glad, be joyful and glad, be joyful, be joyful, be joyful, be joyful, be joyful and glad\u2014be glad in thee.\n\nAnd let such as love thy salvation,\n\nAnd let such as love thy salvation, say, always,\n\nThe Lord be praised,\n\nThe Lord be praised.\n\nLet all those that seek thee be joyful and glad,\n\nAnd let such as love thy salvation, say always,\n\nThe Lord be praised,\n\nThe Lord be praised,\n\nThe Lord be praised.\n\nI waited patiently, I waited patiently for the Lord, for the Lord;And he inclined unto me, and heard my calling:I waited patiently, I waited patiently for the Lord,And he inclined unto me, and heard my calling:And he hath put a new song in my mouth,Even a thanksgiving, even a thanksgiving, even a thanksgiving unto our God.Blessed, Blessed, Blessed, Blessed is the man, Blessed is the man,Blessed is the man that hath set his hope, his hope in the Lord;O Lord my God, Great, Great, Great,Great are the wondrous works which thou hast done.Great are the wondrous works which thou hast done, which thou hast done:If I should declare them and speak of them, they would be more, more, more than I am able to express.I have not kept back thy loving kindness and truth from the great congregation I have not kept back thy loving kindness and truth from the great congregation.Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me,Withdraw not thou thy mercy from me, O Lord;Let thy loving kindness and thy truth always preserve me,Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad,Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad, be joyful, and glad, be joyful and glad, be joyful, be joyful, be joyful, be joyful, be joyful and glad\u2014be glad in thee.And let such as love thy salvation,And let such as love thy salvation, say, always,The Lord be praised,The Lord be praised.Let all those that seek thee be joyful and glad,And let such as love thy salvation, say always,The Lord be praised,The Lord be praised,The Lord be praised.\n\nSoon after his arrival Brown began telling the story of his enslavement and escape at various public forums, where he lectured and performed the hymn that he had sung upon his emergence from the crate, as well as a song about his escape based on the melody of a popular minstrel tune by Stephen Foster. His performances also included printed versions of the songs accompanied by a painted \u201cEngraving of the Box.\u201d Brown soon met a white abolitionist, Charles Stearns, who published in September 1849 the Narrative of Henry Box Brown, Who Escaped from Slavery Enclosed in a Box 3 Feet Long and 2 Wide. Stearns presented the book as a semi-autobiographical account of Brown\u2019s life, written partly in Brown\u2019s voice and partly in his own. The Narrative of Henry Box Brown thus resembled many other slave narratives, a popular genre consisting of autobiographies written or orally related by enslaved persons. Brown and Stearns spent the next two months traveling throughout New England, where they sold copies of the book and gave anti-slavery speeches. Beginning in April 1850 Brown accompanied his lectures and songs with a moving panorama of paintings, called Henry Box Brown\u2019s Mirror of Slavery, that depicted his experiences as an enslaved person and the history and evils of slavery.\n\nAbout the same time, however, the U.S. Congress passed the second Fugitive Slave Act (1850), which provided for the seizure and return of enslaved people who had escaped from one state into another or into a federal territory. Soon afterward, Brown, fearful of being captured, left for England, where he successfully toured with his slavery panorama. In May 1851 a second version of Brown\u2019s autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, Written by Himself, was published in England. Despite its title, Brown did not write the second Narrative himself, though it presents a fuller account of his life and contains details that only he could have provided. The actual writer of the work is unknown.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nBy mid-1851 James C.A. Smith, Jr., who had assisted Brown in his tours in the United States and England, had ceased his collaboration with Brown as a result of a financial dispute. Smith also chastised Brown for not trying harder to use the money he had gained from his anti-slavery tours\u2014which eventually involved additional panoramas, reenactments of his escape, and performances of hypnotism and magic tricks\u2014to purchase the freedom of his wife and family in the United States. Brown subsequently distanced himself from other abolitionists, who criticized him for what they considered to be excessive showmanship and concern with profit. In 1859 Brown remarried, and in 1875 the couple and their daughter, Annie, moved to the United States, where Brown continued his performances."}, {"url": "https://allthatsinteresting.com/henry-box-brown", "page_content": "In 1849, Henry Brown shipped himself 250 miles to the free state of Pennsylvania. Though it took him 27 grueling hours, he lived the remainder of his life as a free man and a traveling performer.\n\nHenry \u201cBox\u201d Brown was a man that had everything torn from him. Born into slavery and separated from his family in a series of inhumane sales, Brown found himself utterly alone by his early 30s. But in a fateful vision, he saw his road to his salvation through a small box.\n\nWith the aid of his allies, Brown defied the odds in 1849 by embarking on a harrowing journey to freedom \u2014 within a box postmarked to a free state. This is the unbelievable true story of the slave who mailed himself to freedom.\n\nAs A Boy, Henry Box Brown Was Separated From His Family\n\nHenry Box Brown was born in 1815 in Louisa County, Virginia. He spent his early years at the Hermitage, a plantation about 10 miles from Yanceyville in Louisa County, with his parents, his four brothers, and his three sisters. His owner was John Barret, the former mayor of Richmond, Virginia. Barret was known to be atypical in how he treated slaves.\n\nBrown described Barret in his autobiography, Narrative of the Life of Henry Box Brown, as \u201cuncommonly kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs he moved about in his dignity he seemed like a god to us, but notwithstanding his kindness although he knew very well what superstitious notions we formed him, he never made the least attempt to correct our erroneous impression, but rather seemed pleased with the reverential feelings which we entertained towards him.\u201d\n\nWhen John Barret was on his deathbed, he sent for Henry Brown and his mother. Believing that their family was going to be freed, the pair came to their owner with \u201cbeating hearts and elated feelings.\u201d Barret\u2019s son had freed 40 of his own slaves several years earlier, however, Barret informed them that they were being allotted to his other son, William Barret, and that they should be obedient to him instead.\n\nBarret claimed that his son promised to treat the Browns with kindness, but what Barret critically ignored was the fact that he was splitting up the Brown family as they were divvied up among his four sons.\n\nBrown\u2019s mother and sister Martha were part of William Barret\u2019s inheritance, but Brown himself was sent to work in a tobacco factory in Richmond at the age of 15. Martha Brown eventually became William Barret\u2019s mistress.\n\nBrown\u2019s Wife And Children Were Sold From Under Him\n\nThough he was torn from his family, Brown managed to find love. Now in his early 20s, Henry Box Brown fell in love with a slave girl named Nancy. She was the slave of a man called Mr. Leigh, a bank clerk. Brown went to Clark and asked for permission to marry her and also asked that he and Nancy not be sold away from one another.\n\nMr. Leigh assured Brown that he would do no such thing. Brown recalled that Leigh \u201cpromised faithfully that he would not sell her, and pretended to entertain an extreme horror of separating families.\u201d\n\nAnd so in 1836, Brown and Nancy became husband and wife in Richmond, Virginia. They eventually produced three children together and joined the First African Baptist Church. Henry even joined the church choir. He became a skilled tobacco worker and earned enough money to rent a home.\n\nBut in August of 1848, Mr. Leigh reneged on his word and sold Nancy and their three children to another slave owner in North Carolina. Brown was not told about what Mr. Leigh had done until it was far too late. He recalled the event later:\n\n\u201cI had not been many hours at my work, when I was informed that my wife and children were taken from their home, sent to the auction mart and sold, and then lay in prison ready to start away the next day for North Carolina with the man who had purchased them. I cannot express, in language, what were my feelings on this occasion.\u201d\n\nNancy, who was pregnant, and their three children were sold along with 350 other slaves to a slave-trading Methodist minister. Brown begged his master to stop the sale of his family, but Leigh coldly told him that \u201cyou can get another wife.\u201d\n\nHenry Brown never saw his wife and children again.\n\nThe Desperate Man Embarked On A Daring 250-Mile Journey\n\nAfter mourning the loss of his family for several months, Henry Box Brown came to the decision that he had to win his freedom \u2014 and he stumbled on his escape plan while engaged in prayer.\n\n\u201cThe idea suddenly flashed across my mind of shutting myself up in a box, and getting myself conveyed as dry goods to a free state,\u201d he later wrote.\n\nBrown immediately secured the help of a freed black man and a member of his choir to aid in his escape. A white shoemaker named Samuel Smith was also was instrumental in his dangerous journey. Ironically, Smith himself owned slaves. Smith put Brown in contact with James Miller McKim, a leader of the Philadelphia chapter of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society who was involved with the Underground Railroad.\n\nBrown then hired a carpenter to construct the box, which was three feet long, two feet wide, two and a half feet deep, and lined with a coarse woolen cloth. It had just three small air holes near where his face would be that would allow him to breathe. A prominent sign was attached that read \u201cThis Side Up With Care.\u201d\n\nThe journey would be an arduous one. Once inside the box, Brown would be unable to shift his position, and he\u2019d have to stay silent for the 247 miles from Richmond to Philadelphia.\n\nNonetheless, on March 23, 1849, Henry Box Brown slipped inside his claustrophobic box to be shipped across the States. Within hours of the shipment, however, the box was placed upside down. The box continuously switched positions, but in one harrowing instance, it almost killed him. Brown recounted his terrifying experience:\n\n\u201cI felt my eyes swelling as if they would burst from their sockets; and the veins on my temples were dreadfully distended with pressure of blood upon my head. In this position I attempted to lift my hand to my face but I had no power to move it; I felt a cold sweat coming over me which seemed to be a warning that death was about to terminate my earthly miseries.\u201d\n\nYet he persevered, and 27 hours later, he arrived in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen the box was opened, Brown tried to stand and lost consciousness. When he eventually awoke, he sang his own version of Psalm 40: \u201cI waited patiently, I waited patiently for the Lord, for the Lord; And he inclined unto me, and heard my calling.\u201d\n\nBrown Failed To Secure His Family\u2019s Freedom\n\nAfter he arrived at freedom in 1849, Brown became a well-known speaker for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, and it was at one of the society\u2019s conventions that he was nicknamed \u201cBox\u201d for his ingenious escape.\n\nHe went on the lecture circuit across the States speaking about his journey. He made something of a show out of it, even bringing with him a moving panorama on which he displayed his escape and preached anti-slavery.\n\nBut some abolitionists, like Frederick Douglass, were not so enthusiastic about Brown\u2019s show. Douglass reportedly wished that Brown had not publicized his escape so that other slaves could have used it to get to freedom as well.\n\nIn fact, Brown ruffled a few feathers among the abolitionist community. He was especially criticized when he was contacted by his family\u2019s new owner who offered to sell his wife and kids back to him but Brown refused.\n\nIn 1850, he moved to England where he continued to tour and present his anti-slavery panorama. He tried his hand at acting and even became a magician for a time before remarrying and returning to the States as a traveling performer.\n\nThe last record of Henry Box Brown is an advertisement for one of his shows in 1889, and he is believed to have died in Toronto, Canada, on June 15, 1897.\n\nAfter learning about Henry Box Brown, check out Cudjo Lewis, the last slave brought to America.

Mr. Brown's comments on secession, insurrection, and the Electoral College are suddenly relevant again.\n\n\n\nWe may be viewing these topics through the lens of racism rather than slavery now, but it is quite eerie to read the words of someone speaking to the same issues, so many years ago.\n\n\n\nThree stars for a prose style unsuited to 2021.\n\n\n\nAudiences coming from a 19th century low-information environment, where microphones or amplification were not invented yet, probably loved these long flowery sentences, and thrilled to hear each phrase declaimed, one after the other, as they sat in a crowded row of uncomfortable chairs. Mr. Brown's delivery no doubt made him a hit on the abolition lecture circuit.\n\n\n\nPicked this book up in solidarity with Henry \"Box\", as my great-great-grandfather also shipped himself to this country, in a steamer trunk, to avoid the Kaiser's wars. Should the \"box\" tactic for escape ever prove necessary in your own life-- Grandpa lasted 3 days in the trunk, until the sailing ship could not turn back to port. Mr. Brown's \"THIS SIDE UP\" wooden crate was a much more dangerous proposition than a steamer trunk. The wooden crate was turned over the wrong way several times as it was loaded and reloaded, which was almost the end of Mr. Brown, who was suspended upside down, unable to move. Using the steamer trunk technique can prevent this potentially fatal problem. By selecting a trunk with a rounded top, you pretty well guarantee that whoever puts the trunk down will ensure that it is turned right side up, so as not to get in trouble for having left a very heavy object sitting on its unstable, wobbly lid.\n\n\n\nAs a reader seeking tips for escape via shipment options, this book disappointed, because Mr. Brown glossed over his planning, in an attempt to avoid revealing sources and methods, implicating those who helped him, or impeding future escapes by others.\n\n\n\nHowever, the escape itself wasn't the point of the book.\n\nThe dramatic escape is used as a way to get the audience's attention for the larger cause of abolition."}, {"url": "https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/brown-henry-box-1816-1889/", "page_content": "To escape enslavement on a plantation near Richmond, Virginia, Henry \u201cBox\u201d Brown in 1849 exploited maritime elements of the Underground Railroad.

Using \u201coverwork\u201d (overtime) money, Brown decided to arrange for his freedom.\n\nHe constructed a wooden crate three feet long and two feet six inches deep with two air holes. With help from Philadelphia abolitionists, he obtained a legal freight contract from Adams Express.

The package was a heavy wooden box holding Brown\u2019s 200 pounds.\n\nHenry \u201cBox\u201d Brown loaded himself in Richmond on March 22, 1849, and from there the package moved via horse-drawn carriage to the rail depot of the Richmond-Fredericksburg-Potomac Railroad. Brown\u2019s freight car was off-loaded 56 miles north on the Potomac River\u2019s Aquia Landing and then placed aboard a Potomac River steamboat and shipped 40 miles upriver into Washington D.C. Here, the \u201cpackage\u201d transferred to the Washington & Baltimore Train Depot and passed by rail through Baltimore, arriving 149 miles later in the Port of Philadelphia on March 24, 1849. A local Philadelphia carting firm delivered \u201cthe package\u201d to the Philadelphia Anti-Slavery Society. Delivered in 27 hours, Brown was welcomed by Philadelphia abolitionists led by Underground Railroad organizer, William Still.\n\nBrown carried a bladder filled with drinking water and a gimlet if he needed to drive more air holes in the box.

It had a two-player setup where players would use separate controllers that connected to an analog computer and had an oscilloscope for a screen.\n\nThe game was up for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory's annual public exhibition where hundreds of visitors lined up for a chance to play.\n\nWhat was the first video game console?\n\nThe forefather of video games is Nimatron, an early electromechanical game machine from 1940s. It came in a form of a computer allowing you to play the mathematical game of NIM.\n\nBut the first video game console (and a true console) is the so-called \u201cBrown Box\u201d, a game system designed for commercial home use which was released in 1967. The device was licensed to Magnavox, which released it as the Magnavox Odyssey in 1972.\n\nUnfortunately, with only 300,000 consoles sold, the Magnavox Odyssey was discontinued in 1975. Whether the poor sales were due to mismanaged in-store marketing campaigns or the fact that home gaming was a relatively new concept to the average American at that time, the Magnavox device was no more.\n\nStill, as mismanaged as it may have been, the \u201cBrown Box\u201d was the start of the digital gaming we know today.\n\nWhat was the First Sega Console?\n\nThe first Sega console was the SG-1000, which was released in 1983 and sold only in Japan where Sega released several variations of this console. The third variation, the Sega Mark III, was rebranded as the Master System and released worldwide in 1985.\n\nAfter that, Sega went on to produce the highly successful Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside of North America), as well as other popular models.\n\nWhat was the First Nintendo Console?\n\nThe Nintendo NES console (aka the Nintendo Entertainment System - NES), was released as the Famicom in 1983 in Japan. The console made it easy to play popular arcade games (such as Donkey Kong) on a home TV. Its success in Japan piqued American interest and the NES stormed America in1986.\n\nDuck Hunt, Hogan\u2019s Alley, and Super Mario Bros were just some of the playable games which contributed to Nintendo\u2019s massive success with over 60 million NES consoles sold worldwide.\n\nWhat Was The First Nintendo Game?\n\nThe first Nintendo-developed and manufactured arcade video game was EVR Race.

We'll just do a quick rundown of some of the most important moments in gaming that opened the door to today's video game entertainment, along with some interesting photographs taken at the Computer History Museum.\n\nThe first ever video game on a computer was made by Steve Russell on the PDP-1 minicomputer of MIT's RLE club, and it was called \"Spacewar!\" This was in 1962, and the game was soon a success on PDP-1 computers. Alan Kotok and Bob Saunders even built a gamepad to make the control of the game easier.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nThe first prototype of a game console was made in 1967 by Ralph Baer, a German engineer, and it was called the \"Brown Box.\" It worked on a standard television and the first game, called \"chase game,\" was very simple. With help from his colleagues at the electronics firm where he worked, Baer developed 12 games and managed to even add a light gun to the system. Eventually, the team used the experience gained from the \"brown box\" prototype, and the first commercial game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, hit the stores in 1972.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nAtari's Pong wasn't a game console but an arcade machine, but it helped make video games popular. In 1972 Allan Alcorn finished a working Pong prototype and, along with Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, installed the machine at a local bar. There was so much excitement about the arcade game that a few days later the coin mechanism couldn't receive any more quarters because it was full.\n\nImage 1 of 2\n\nFairchild Semiconductor is a pioneer in manufacturing transistors and integrated circuits. The company was founded in 1957, and for many years it played an active role in computer hardware. Fairchild was involved in other endeavors as well, including gaming consoles. The first home video game console that used programmable ROM cartridges and featured a microprocessor (CPU) was the Fairchild Channel F, which was released in 1976, a year before the Atari Video Computer System (VCS), or Atari 2600 as it was called later. The Channel F fared pretty well in sales, although it didn't manage to beat the highly popular Atari VCS.\n\nImage 1 of 4\n\nThe Atari 2600 game console was released in 1977, and a year later the fist Atari 8-bit home computers were introduced. The 400 and 800 models featured a full keyboard and used a MOS 6502 CPU clocked at 1.79 MHz. The most interesting fact about these computers was their ability to double as game consoles.\n\nAtari games, along with software applications, came on plug-in cartridges, and thanks to the co-processor chips, the graphics and sound capabilities were much better than other computers of this era (e.g. the Apple II and Commodore PET). It took four years for a competing offer to make its appearance on the market in the form of the mighty Commodore 64.\n\nFinally, in 1982 Atari Inc. released a port of the famous Pac-Man game for the Atari 2600. Although the port wasn't very successful, mostly because of the limited time that the lead programmer was given to complete the task, Atari was still able to sell around seven million copies of it.\n\n\n\nMORE: Desktop GPU Performance Hierarchy Table"}, {"url": "https://vglegacy.com/hardware/brown-box/", "page_content": "While waiting at a bus terminal for another Sanders engineer to arrive in town for a meeting with a client, Baer took the opportunity to write down some notes on the subject of using standard home television sets to play games. The following morning, he turned his notes that he written down into a four-page paper which described the idea of playing television games on a home television set. The document listed various types of games that might be playable using a standard television set, such as action games, board games, sports games, chase games and many others. Baer was creating what is now known as video game genres even before a system was created. The four paged document is now located at the Smithsonian along with all of the game hardware that was created over the next three years.\n\nWhat Baer originally had in mind was to develop a small game box that would play simplistic games and perhaps cost $25 at retail. He asked one of the engineers in his division at Sanders Associates to read, date and sign the document he created as this was a standard procedure to establish a legal record. This document was used years later in 1974 in Federal Courts in Chicago, San Francisco, New York, Ottawa and many other cities in pursuit of patent infringement which would result in millions of dollars changing hands.\n\nSanders Associates was a military electronics company and video games had absolutely nothing to do with the normal business of developing complex military electronic systems. At the time Baer was a Division Manager and Chief Engineer for Equipment Design at Sanders where he ran eight departments with up to 500 technical and support personnel. He also supervised much of the internal research and development work at Sanders. Baer was running a large operation at the time and could afford to utilize a technician to do some experimental work without affecting his division\u2019s productivity. After a few demonstrations to the Corporate Director of Research & Development at Sanders it wasn\u2019t long before the project became official and would eventually payoff very handsomely for Sanders.\n\nThe development of the gaming device continued through 1968 with most of the work being done by two engineers, Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch. Both of these engineers made important contributions to the game concept as Baer supervised the activity which was being done at Sanders Canal Street building in Nashua, New Hampshire. Several game systems were developed which allowed them to play different types of sports games such as Ping-Pong, volleyball, handball, soccer, hockey and several others. They also developed a light-gun which could be used to shoot at targets on the screen of the television set. Though this was not the first light gun game it was the first light gun developed to work on a television set, the first to be used in a video game and was the first video game peripheral.\n\nBy late 1968 Baer finished building their final demonstration game system, the \u201cBrown Box\u201d. It was switch programmable and played a large number of sports, maze and quiz games. The system also had several games based on the light-gun which was created and gave the ability to shoot at stationary or moving targets displayed on the screen.\n\nThe system was finally complete and the technology that went into the system was something that could be massed produced at a reasonable cost to allow for it to be marketed to the general public. Baer tried to introduce video games to the cable television industry in 1968 but was not successful. He then proceeded to approach American television manufacturers throughout 1969 in hopes that they would be interested in this new concept. The \u201cBrown Box\u201d was demonstrated to representatives at RCA, Sylvania, GE and Motorola but no one was willing to take the risk involved in marketing the new concept to the general public.\n\nRepresentatives from Magnavox went to Sanders Associates in Nashua, New Hampshire where Baer and his team demonstrated the \u201cBrown Box\u201d for them. The reactions were overwhelmingly favorable but still it was seen as a large risk for Magnavox and they held off on moving forward. Two years later in 1971 Magnavox revisited the idea of television gaming and finally took a license from Sander Associates. Their 1972 Odyssey home video game system, a production engineered version of the \u201cBrown Box\u201d was the result. This was the first home video game console and was the beginning of the home video game market which is now a multibillion-dollar industry."}, {"url": "https://www.tellmebest.com/first-video-game-console/", "page_content": "What was the first video game console and why might you have never heard of it? It predated some of the most popular ones we know\n\nBy Doug Norrie |\n\nThe video gaming industry has become a 100s of billions of dollars behemoth at this point, operating with a massive market share and becoming part of the fabric of our current society. It\u2019s been a long time coming though I think few saw that this would ever grow to its current size. Video games are as much a part of our culture as anything else, especially on the entertainment side of things. They account for huge sums of money in the economic system and are used for hours and hours on end by folks of all ages. But where did it all start? What was the first video game console? How did we get to this place?\n\nMuch of that can be seen and explored in our History of Gaming Consoles which looks at the path and journey of these machines over many, many decades. It\u2019s a long and winding story, starting pretty innocently (though intuitively) in a research institute and growing at an almost exponential pace over the years.\n\nHere we\u2019ll look back at the first video game console and what it meant for the industry. How was it born and what did it ultimately give life to in this market? For many, the first video game console might not be what you\u2019d expect, and it didn\u2019t even necessarily have the staying power of what would come after. It laid some of the groundwork, though others went and ran with the idea and concept for their own gain. Let\u2019s take a look at the build-up for the industry and then what would become the first viable video game console to hit the market.\n\nTHE FIRST VIDEO GAMES\n\nIn the history of video gaming consoles, it makes sense that the first steps along this journey wouldn\u2019t be a box, some controllers, and a wealth of games showing up in living rooms around the world. Of course not. Though that\u2019s what would ultimately help grow the industry as a whole, before gaming consoles could take root as viable sellers, there had to be an established baseline for video games in general.\n\nMuch of this can be traced back to two specific games developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Those were Tennis for Two and SpaceWar!. Back at a time when computers were still a long way off from being in everyone\u2019s homes and offices, there were select groups out there working with this relatively new technology. Though it had military applications to start (what tech doesn\u2019t?), there were some folks exploring how everyday users could interact with the machines in a way that could be both fun and entertaining. At this point, there didn\u2019t seem to be any big push to bring computer games to the marketplace mostly because there were so few computers. But that didn\u2019t mean some weren\u2019t thinking about the possibilities.\n\nThe first was William Higinbotham who was working at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. We began the first iteration of the video game console, or at least its bones when he helped create and manufacture the game Tennis for Two. This was played on what looked like a radar readout screen and Higinbotham helped bring about the first iterations of the controller or joystick. Connected to the computer and readout, Tennis for Two allowed for two players to knock a ball back and forth using the controls. Sound like Pong? Yeah, it should. This game was essentially the predecessor for that game which came around 14 years later.\n\nThe other game which came around near the beginning of this timeline was SpaceWar! which was developed by a group of MIT students in 1962. This was another game using a similar display as Tennis for Two though it brought in that science-fiction element that would become a backbone of early gaming. In this game, two players (a ship and a wedge) were in a \u201cbattle\u201d to shoot each other while moving around the screen and avoiding the gravitational pull of the \u201cstar\u201d in the center.\n\nWAS ATARI OR NINTENDO THE FIRST GAME CONSOLE?\n\nIf you were to ask most folks, those without extensive knowledge of the history of the first video game console, it\u2019s likely that they would say one of two things: Atari or Nintendo. In many ways, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily be wrong seeing as how these two were, most definitely, the video game consoles that appealed the most to the masses. We will get to both in a little bit with just a little more detail. But it\u2019s worth noting here that they weren\u2019t the first video game consoles. Far from it.\n\nWhat Atari and Nintendo did was capitalize on a growing video game movement while also learning from the mistakes of their predecessors. Sure, this could be the story of almost any successful company in any industry, but in the gaming world it\u2019s particularly apt because there was so much some of the first companies did right, but also a ton they did wrong. Frankly, it\u2019s still happening today. So no, Atari and Nintendo weren\u2019t the first. And as we know they definitely weren\u2019t the last either.\n\nARCADE GAMES ON THE RISE\n\nTennis for Two and SpaceWar! are widely considered to help shape the video game industry, but neither really had any real commercial success. The movement had started and there were now plenty of folks out there who wanted to bring video games and consoles to the masses. There were somewhat parallel timelines and tracks happening during the late 1960s and 1970s that dovetailed in a way to help bring about the first video game console.\n\nFor starters, in 1971 coin-op arcade games began to gain popularity with the release of Computer Space, the first arcade cabinet box game manufactured and delivered to different locations. It took its approach from SpaceWar! and ended up gaining some traction, though was far from an industry mover.\n\nWhile Computer Space was first, it wasn\u2019t necessarily credited with kickstarting the next wave of video games in arcades. That was Pong which came out in 1972. Taking its direction from Tennis for Two (see how we are building here?), the game was manufactured and developed by Atari. Though not the first video game console, Pong is credited with essentially bringing this medium into the zeitgeist.\n\nInterestingly enough (though obviously not a coincidence) the two games had the same creators, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney who would found Atari. It was under the latter banner that they put out Pong and it completely worked this time around. The game was a hit in local establishments and helped Atari gain footing in the video game industry, setting the stage for what would happen next for the company. But before that happened, someone else had to develop the first video game console.\n\nTHE BROWN BOX\n\nLet\u2019s meet Ralph Henry Baer who is sometimes (and probably correctly) credited as the \u201cFather of Video Games\u201d. No, he didn\u2019t create the first one, that\u2019s been established. But Baer was the one who oversaw the development of the device that would eventually help people bring video game consoles into their own homes. That\u2019s because Baer was one of the first people who saw video games as a viable market mover and he also visioned something that, at the time, few were thinking about. Rather than developing a single-player video game for computer systems (still hard to come by) or for cabinet games (you still had to go somewhere to play them) he wanted to find a way to use something so many already had in their homes.\n\nAmazingly, not everyone was able to see this as viable and many actually scoffed at the idea. Regardless, Baer pushed ahead and with a small team at what would be called BAE Systems, the group developed what was known as the Brown Box. In many ways, this device was the precursor for the modern-day development of video game consoles. It was, like the name suggests, a brown box that could connect to television sets through connections in the back.\n\nAttached two the box were two \u201ccontollers\u201d each with knobs that could control what was happening on the screen. Sure, it looks antiquated now, but at the time this was a revolutionary device, one that finally could bring video gaming into people\u2019s homes if they so chose. Frankly, for decades the video gaming industry wouldn\u2019t diverge all that much (at least aesthetically) from what Baer first created with the Brown Box.\n\nENTER MAGNAVOX WITH THE FIRST VIDEO GAME CONSOLE\n\nBaer knew he had something big on his hands, or at least he thought he did based on some initial reactions. So he went about shopping the Brown Box to various folks. He found a taker in 1972 when Magnavox agreed to buy the system and began mass-producing it for the market. In the acquisition, they changed the name from Brown Box to Magnavox Odyssey. It\u2019s hard to argue with that move and the latter certainly would have seemed like the branding shift at the time. It connected to televisions through an input on the unit and, at the time, basically acted like a channel on the television screen. Magnavox reworked the exterior casing to fall more in line with the color schemes of television sets at the time.\n\nAt the time of the release, the Magnavox Odyssey included 12 games that came with the console. These were broken up among six different cards that were inserted into the device. Those games really spoke to the simplicity of the time and looking back almost looked like a time capsule in and among themselves. The first video game console games were Table Tennis, Ski, Simon Says, Tennis, Analogic, Hockey, Football, Cat and Mouse, Haunted House, Submarine, Roulette, and States. There were other games that were sold separately.\n\nWhile the Magnavox Odyssey did distinguish between the names of the games, it\u2019s worth noting here that almost all of them were of the same baseline type of play. They involved white balls and something like paddles on the screen to move the former around. The mechanics changed slightly, but the viewer now, with video games coming so far, one would probably think they were all the same game.\n\nAnd really the only way to distinguish between and among the games was to put an overlay on the television screen, a separate piece outside of the video game console. This meant essentially tracking the game yourself. It\u2019s hard to blame Magnavox and Baer obviously, they had done something no one had done before and lit a video game fuse forever. But because of the clunkiness and the cost ($99 or $675 dollars in today\u2019s money), the Magnavox Odyssey didn\u2019t take off at all.\n\nTHE FIRST VIDEO GAME CONSOLE IS A BUST\n\nSomeone always needs to be first and they often need to take the lumps in order to push forward an entire industry. That\u2019s definitely the case with the first video game console. Though it came along at a time when there was nothing else on the market, it failed to gain a real market foothold. As mentioned, the price was extremely high at the time, making it cost-prohibitive, to say the least. And because video games, from a name recognition aspect, hadn\u2019t become everyday talking points, many didn\u2019t see the need to put one of them in their own homes.\n\nAnd because this was a new venture, there were aspects of the video game experience that wouldn\u2019t carry over into future iterations from other companies. Namely, the Magnavox Odyssey came with components and pieces like the aforementioned video overlays, but also dice, chips, cards, and play money that was supposed to be used in conjunction with the different games. This was likely done for two reasons. The first was to help ease the transition from traditional board games into what was happening on the television screen. Folks just simply weren\u2019t used to playing games strictly on a screen with a controller. And also, the games themselves needed to be livened up in some way mostly because they were pretty boring.\n\nIn all, the Magnavox Odyssey, the first video game console, only ended up selling 350,000 units, a number well below the original expectations. And because the name was associated with a particular brand of televisions at the time (Magnavox, duh) there could have been some confusion about the compatibility with other brands. This all led in some part to the Odyssey being underwhelming in terms of sales.\n\nTHE NEXT VIDEO GAME CONSOLE IS REALLY THE FIRST\n\nMagnavox Odyssey didn\u2019t have the commercial success its creators thought it might have out of the box, but it did lead the way for Atari to take the world by storm a few years later. The company had been developing cabinet games for a few years, inspired by Pong and then adding games like Space Invaders and Asteroids to the mix. These already had arcade cabinet game name brand credibility, making the shift to the home console much smoother and much more profitable. But none of it would have happened without the Magnavox Odyssey hitting the shelves first."}, {"url": "http://www.thegameconsole.com/ralph-baer-brown-box/", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nRalp H.

Sales for the console were hurt by poor marketing and misinformation as many consumers believed that the Odyssey would only work on a Magnavox brand television. This led to other consoles in the future writing an explanation on their box saying \u201cWorks on any television set, black and white or color\u201d to avoid any confusion. Magnavox restricted the sales of the Odyssey to Magnavox franchised dealer stores only which narrowed the potential sales base considerably as the system was not widely available in many areas. Magnavox also mismanaged the sale of the additional game packs and system add-ons as sales personnel were not educated on the Odyssey. Magnavox discontinued the Odyssey in 1975 after releasing 12 game cards with the ability to play 28 games in total during the system\u2019s lifespan.\n\nAtari was extremely successful in the video arcade market so they decided the next logical step was to expand into the home video game market. It was 1974 when Atari started to design a home version of \u201cPong\u201d an idea that was proposed by engineer Harold Lee. At the time there was only one company in the home video game market which was Magnavox. With the Odyssey\u2019s not being adopted by many customers mainly due to the misconception of it only being compatible with Magnavox television sets it seemed like the perfect time for Atari to take a stab at the home video game market.\n\nAtari was able to incorporate advance features into their \u201cPong\u201d home console that gave them an edge of their competitors. The system used a single chip that provided the game with digital onscreen scoring and sound.\n\nIn 1975, Atari started looking for ways to distribute their new home \u201cPong\u201d system but it wasn\u2019t easy finding a distributor due to the track record that Magnavox had with the Odyssey. Retailers felt the price of the system was too expensive to draw an interest from the general public. After being rejected by numerous toys and electronics manufacturers Atari tried contacting Sears & Roebuck to see if they would have any better luck trying to work out distribution agreement. They were directed to Tom Quinn who was the buyer for Sears\u2019 sporting goods department and he expressed interest but wanted the system demonstrated for a few executives first. Al Alcorn travelled to Chicago to demonstrate the pong home system prototype for the Sears executives and despite some minor technical issues with the prototype was able to obtain their approval.\n\nNow that the executives gave their blessing, Quinn started to work with Nolan Bushnell to see if they could reach an agreement. Quinn wanted exclusive rights to the system as well as 150,000 systems units before the holiday season. Bushnell agreed to the terms even though he knew that Atari would not be able to produce 150,000 units with their current facility. Atari acquired a new factory through funding by venture capitalist Don Valentine in order to produce the promised 150,000 units for Sears. In the end Atari was able to fulfill the order for Sears. All systems manufactured in 1975 were branded with Sears\u2019 \u201cTele-Games\u201d name but in 1976 Atari started releasing a version under their own brand name."}, {"url": "https://www.wired.com/2007/06/gallery-game-history/", "page_content": "\n\nCourtesy of Ralph Baer\n\nBaer's Brown Box demonstration unit soon sported a nifty light gun.

The speedy hedgehog got his start on the Sega Genesis and has since starred in more than 20 games, and counting. Sonic is now slated to co-star in a game with Mario called Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games, which will be released on the Nintendo Wii and DS in time for the holidays.

It almost didn't happen. Sony only released the PlayStation as a stand-alone unit after an agreement to manufacture the product as a CD-ROM add-on for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System fell through.

Image: Courtesy of Sega\n\nA portrait of failure, the Sega Saturn was the little console that couldn't. It cost too much ($400) and was too difficult to program. Sega's choice to have a surprise launch for the console angered retailers. It never emerged as a true competitor for the PlayStation, and died a premature death. Courtesy of Sega\n\nThe Nintendo 64 was the last game console to feature cartridge-based games. Courtesy of Nintendo\n\nOn the date of the Nintendo 64's North American launch, only two games were available for the system. It didn't matter one bit; one of those games was Super Mario 64, a brilliant platformer that took the iconic hero Mario into the third dimension. Image: Courtesy of Nintendo\n\nOn 9/9/99 the video-game industry fielded its biggest console release yet. Sega recorded one-day sales of $98 million, and the Dreamcast seemed to have a promising future. Sadly, it never fulfilled that promise. Although the Dreamcast was the first game console to feature a built-in modem for online gaming, the console was eclipsed by the release of Sony's PlayStation 2. The Dreamcast was the final console Sega released. Courtesy of Sega\n\nChu Chu Rocket was Sega's first Dreamcast game built specifically for online play. It wasn't the first game to be played over a modem, but it heralded a shift in the console market toward online gaming.

Seaman was the first console game ever to use voice-recognition technology; it came bundled with a microphone and players could talk with the oftentimes disturbing fish-man hybrid. Image: Courtesy of Sega\n\nA behemoth of a game console, the PlayStation 2 launched in North America in 2000 and, despite the release of a successor in the PlayStation 3, is still considered a viable platform by most game developers. The PlayStation 2 was the first game console to play DVDs and the console has sold more than 115 million units worldwide.

An open-ended 3-D crime drama from the third-person perspective. GamePro magazine's claim that Auto is the most important game ever made has some merit \u2013 its go anywhere, do anything play flew in the face of console games' traditional dependence on linear play, and the title served as inspiration for countless other console offerings. Courtesy of Games Press\n\nNintendo stumbled with the GameCube. The console came with its own carrying handle and its small, cubish appearance made it look like a child's purse. Although a fine system, the GameCube suffered because of its perceived \"kiddy console\" image, and was eclipsed by the PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Xbox. Courtesy of Nintendo\n\nThe Microsoft Xbox marked the return of an American company to video-game console manufacturing. Bricklike in its appearance and initially packaged with a controller so bulky it was derisively nicknamed \"the Duke,\" the Xbox sold well in North America and Europe, and hardly at all in Japan. The console was the first to require a broadband connection to play online titles and was also notable for being the first to offer a built-in hard drive. Courtesy of Games Press\n\nMicrosoft's Xbox Live online-game service, using the mantra \"It's good to play together,\" set the standard for console connectivity. Players could create their own identity and build a list of friends, as well as download game demos, new content and, all-too-often, game patches as well. (And, as this picture from Microsoft proves, it's crawling with beautiful women!) The service debuted shortly after the release of the original Xbox and recently expanded service to include PCs and the Xbox 360. Courtesy of Microsoft\n\nThe Xbox 360 was the first console to come in two separate versions at launch. The 360's Core system was a pared-down version of the Premium version, and was widely mocked by serious gamers. The 360 was also the first console to launch with a wireless game controller. Courtesy of Microsoft\n\nSony released the successor to PlayStation 3 in late 2006, and although initial hype was great, demand for the console has died down considerably. Sony's decision to release versions of PlayStation 3 for $500 and $600 respectively has hampered sales. The PlayStation 3 is the first game console to offer support for Blu-Ray discs. Courtesy of Games Press\n\nNintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto is one of console gaming's most revered creators. Beyond Mario, Miyamoto is responsible for such coin-operated and console classics as Donkey Kong, Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario 64. More recently, he's credited for the Nintendo DS and the Wii. In March, game developers gave him the Lifetime Achievement Award and Time Magazine recently named him one of 2007's Most Influential People of the Year. Courtesy of Games Press\n\nThe Wii offers a unique control scheme, with its motion-sensitive remote and nunchuk controllers. Although underpowered in comparison to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the Wii has been heralded as revolutionary. Its games often involve making simple motions to replicate actions like swinging a racket or throwing punches and it appeals to a wide demographic.

Nope, not the Atari 2600, or even the popular Nintendo NES from the '80s.\n\nIn fact, the very first console dates back to 1967, when \"The Brown Box\" was released, five years before the Magnavox Odyssey launched in the early '70s, according to RIPT Apparel(Opens in a new window), which compiled a complete history of video game consoles into a tidy timeline (see below).\n\nHome video games didn't take off until about 1973, when Atari's Pong arcade machine became so popular that the company decided to market the game as a home console two years later.\n\nIn the same year, Magnavox developed the Odyssey 100 and 200, in an effort to improve upon its former system. The TV manufacturer continued to release more Odyssey boxes, turning out the 300, 400, and 500 series in 1976. They were overshadowed the next year, though, when Atari's iconic 2600 hit the market.\n\nNintendo, meanwhile, delivered its first console with 1978's Color TV Game Series, which, according to RIPT Apparel, followed the Atari Pong-style games and was only available for sale in Japan.\n\nCabbage Patch Kids maker Coleco had a decent run in the late '70s, pushing out five consoles in two years, and also introduced a line of ROM cartridges for the Atari 2600 and Intellivision before exiting the video game business in a few years later.\n\n\"As the struggle for domination continues between Nintendo and Sega, each of them released brand new consoles to challenge each other's positions,\" RIPT said, pointing to the classic Nintendo Entertainment System (1983) and the No. 1 console of its time, the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis (1988).\n\nTwo years later, the Super NES system rang in a new decade with massive competition.\n\nThe first few years of the '90s marked what RIPT called a \"notable shift in the medium used for storing games,\" moving from cartridges to the more modern compact discs, helping to increase the capacity for video gaming and prompting a transition from 2D graphics to 3D.\n\nSony finally entered the console fight in 1994 when it introduced the Playstation, competing for interest along with the cartridge-based Sega Genesis 2 and 3 (released in 1994 and '97, respectively), and the new Sega Saturn, aimed at rivaling other CD-compatible consoles. Nintendo stuck with the cartridge system for its Nintendo 64, which hit shelves in the mid '90s.\n\nIn 1998, Sega became an Internet-gaming pioneer with the Sega Dreamcast's built-in modem for online playing. By the new millennium, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo began taking over the market, with the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube, respectively.\n\n\"Finally, the current generation of video game console only has room for three major competitors: Xbox 360, Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii,\" RIPT said. With the first two's full 1080p HD graphics and the Wii's innovative movement-sensing remote, \"it seems that video gaming had indeed come a long, long way,\" the graphic said.\n\nFor a full look at the decades-spanning video game industry, check out RIPT Apparel's infographic below.
