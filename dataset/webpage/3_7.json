In 1685 he left for North America, where he was elected rector of Varina parish, Henrico county, Va.\n\nAppointed bishop\u2019s representative in Virginia in 1689, Blair proposed (1691) the founding of a college. With the endorsement of the Virginia General Assembly he returned to England to secure from the English sovereigns William III and Mary II a charter and a grant of funds for the college, which was named for its royal patrons. The charter was granted on Feb. 8, 1693. As the first president of the college, Blair proved to be a canny and expert fund-raiser, extracting money from people of all ranks and persuasions and, especially, from the estate of the natural philosopher Robert Boyle. He served for 50 years, one of the longest tenures of any university president."}, {"url": "https://www.scencyclopedia.org/sce/entries/revolutionary-war/", "page_content": "At the beginning of the 1770s, the Commons House of Assembly was embroiled in the latest in a series of fierce power struggles with royal officials, known as the Wilkes Fund Controversy. Coupled with new imperial initiatives, these clashes convinced the colony\u2019s elite that if it wanted to control the political destiny of South Carolina, then separation was the only answer.\n\nThe decision of South Carolinians to leave the British Empire was as much the result of local grievances as it was of changes in imperial policy that occurred after the French and Indian War. At the beginning of the 1770s, the Commons House of Assembly was embroiled in the latest in a series of fierce power struggles with royal officials, known as the Wilkes Fund Controversy. Coupled with new imperial initiatives, these clashes convinced the colony\u2019s elite that if it wanted to control the political destiny of South Carolina, then separation was the only answer.\n\nWhile the Wilkes Fund Controversy was still boiling, news arrived of the Tea Act granting a monopoly to the British East India Company. In late 1773 the arrival of a ship with a cargo of tea led to the call for a \u201cMass Meeting\u201d of the populace on December 3. At the meeting, all present agreed to boycott the tea and to establish a committee to enforce the boycott.\n\nThe Mass Meeting laid the groundwork for an independent government in South Carolina. At subsequent gatherings, the Mass Meeting established a General Committee to enforce its resolutions and the nonimportation association. When word arrived of the Intolerable Acts\u2013Parliament\u2019s response to the Boston Tea Party\u2013 South Carolina had in place an organization that could react.\n\nWhen the Boston town meeting asked for assistance and the New York General Assembly suggested an intercolonial congress, the General Committee issued a call for a \u201cGeneral Meeting\u201d of delegates from all corners of the province. The General Meeting, in Charleston on July 6, 1774, adopted a series of resolutions, elected five delegates to the First Continental Congress, and created a Committee of 99 to act on behalf of the General Meeting. This committee quickly became the de facto government of South Carolina as lowcountry residents responded to the Committee of 99\u2013not the king\u2019s appointees. The Commons House fully supported the actions of the General Meeting and appropriated funds for the congressional delegation.\n\nIn November 1774 the General Meeting called for the election of a Provincial Congress, which convened in Charleston in January 1775. Over the next nine months, the Provincial Congress and its committees consolidated their hold on the colony. It authorized the seizure of arms and ammunition from royal powder magazines and the Statehouse, the issuing of paper currency to support its operations, the raising of three regiments to defend the colony, and the creation of a Council of Safety with unlimited authority.\n\nAlthough a majority of congress approved these actions, it was a slim one. Not everyone was ready to make the break with the empire in the summer of 1775; however, the new revolutionary government was in no mood to tolerate dissent. Those who disagreed with congress were dealt with harshly.\n\nThe backcountry was a real concern. Nearly two-thirds of the colony\u2019s white population resided there, and backcountry residents had more of a beef with the provincial government in Charleston than they did with the British. After backcountry Loyalists ambushed a revolutionary raiding party, congress sent William Henry Drayton and a delegation to the interior settlements, and they achieved an uneasy truce.\n\nWhile Drayton and his team were in the backcountry, Lord William Campbell, the last royal governor, arrived. He refused to recognize the Provincial Congress as a legitimate body, and a meeting with the Commons House accomplished nothing. In September 1775 Campbell officially dissolved the assembly and fled for his life to a British warship in Charleston harbor. There was no one now to challenge the authority of the Provincial Congress, and it moved swiftly to suppress any opposition.\n\nRenewed tensions in the backcountry led to the mobilization of both Loyalist and patriot militia units. In November 1775, at Ninety Six, there was a skirmish and the first blood of the Revolution in the state was shed. In retaliation, Colonel Richard Richardson raised a force of more than four thousand patriot militiamen to subdue backcountry Loyalists. In what became known as the \u201cSnow Campaign,\u201d he defeated the Loyalist militia and tracked down and captured those who had fled.\n\nThe new year began with the Provincial Congress in control of all of South Carolina. The backcountry was quiet, and British war ships had left Charleston harbor. In March 1776 South Carolina became the first southern colony and the second of the thirteen to draft a state constitution. The Provincial Congress declared itself to be the new General Assembly of South Carolina and elected John Rutledge as president of the state.\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s new government was concerned with the defense of the state\u2013and with good reason. There were incessant rumors that the British intended to attack Charleston and to incite the Cherokees to invade the frontier settlements. On June 28 a British invasion force launched a combined naval and amphibious assault against revolutionary forces on Sullivan\u2019s Island. Led by William Moultrie and William Thomson, the revolutionaries repulsed a British landing force and the sand and palmetto-log fort rendered the naval bombardment ineffective. At the end of the day American casualties were light, and the British withdrew in disarray. The Battle of Sullivan\u2019s Island gave a tremendous boost to the revolutionary cause and the upper hand to those who favored a more resolute course of action.\n\nThe British fleet remained off Charleston until August. Its presence, and the urging of northern Indian nations, spurred the Cherokees and some Tories to launch a series of raids in July. The response was immediate and brutal. Andrew Williamson led backcountry militia units against the Native Americans, destroyed most of their towns east of the mountains, and then joined with the North Carolina militia to do the same in that state and Georgia. For the remainder of the war, the Cherokees were not a factor.\n\nWhile the backcountry was subduing the Cherokees, news arrived on August 2 of the Declaration of Independence. That, however, may have been the high tide of revolutionary fervor for a while. After the twin threats of invasion and Indian war had been defeated, the state entered a two-year period of calm that bordered on apathy.\n\nAfter independence the state needed a new constitution, and a new one was adopted without fanfare in March 1778. Maintaining zeal for the revolution was difficult. So many legislators absented themselves that it was difficult for the General Assembly to meet a quorum. Enlistments declined, and in order to fill its quotas for the Continental army, the legislature offered land and cash bonuses to volunteers. In 1778 the militia law was revised so that one-third of the militia could be slaves (only in support roles). Some black Carolinians, however, were more than engineers or sailors. There were black soldiers in Francis Marion\u2019s partisan band and in militia units at King\u2019s Mountain and Cowpens.\n\nThe lull in the war in the South ended in autumn 1778 when the British captured Savannah. With a base of operations, they could now execute their \u201csouthern strategy\u201d to roll up the southern colonies one by one. Throughout 1779 the British made a series of probing attacks against South Carolina almost to the walls of Charleston. In September a French fleet arrived, and the next month the allies launched an unsuccessful attack on Savannah. After the battle the French sailed away, leaving the Americans to fend for themselves.\n\nThe new year did not bode well for the American cause in the South. The already thin ranks of the Continentals had been further depleted at Savannah. Benjamin Lincoln, the commander of American forces, under pressure from South Carolina politicians, let himself be convinced that he should move his army behind the walls of Charleston.\n\nSir Henry Clinton, commander of British forces, brought a large, well-supplied army and a powerful fleet to South Carolina in February 1780. By the end of March, the British army had begun a siege of Charleston and the Royal Navy a blockade by sea. Lincoln\u2019s army was trapped.\n\nOn April 13 Governor John Rutledge and several members of his council slipped out of the city so that state government could continue. Two months earlier he had been granted extraordinary powers by the General Assembly to prosecute the war. On May 12, 1780, Lincoln surrendered his army of more than 5,500 men. When word of the capitulation reached interior garrisons, they too surrendered.\n\nThe capture of Charleston was celebrated throughout the British Empire. But within weeks, blunders by Clinton and his subordinates led to the undoing of his victory. Under the terms of surrender, which applied to civilians as well as military personnel, all adult males were paroled. They agreed that they would not take up arms against the British, and in turn they would not be molested. That suited many Carolinians who simply wanted to go back to their farms and families. However, on June 3 Clinton abrogated the parole of most Carolinians and issued a proclamation that they must take a new oath of allegiance that would require them to take up arms against their fellow Carolinians\u2013something most were loath to do. He then announced the confiscation of the estates of leading revolutionaries and looked the other way as his army plundered the lowcountry. Encouraged, Tories launched a campaign of retribution.\n\nTo solidify his hold on the province, Clinton dispatched units to occupy Ninety Six and Camden. He then left South Carolina for New York, placing Lord Charles Cornwallis in command. Cornwallis ordered his men to \u201ctake the most vigorous measures to extinguish the rebellion.\u201d As they moved into the interior, British troops followed his orders. They executed individuals almost at whim and harassed and maltreated virtually everyone. One commander declared that Presbyterian meetinghouses were \u201csedition shops\u201d and burned those he encountered. Rather than cowing the populace, these wanton acts of cruelty roused them.\n\nIn less than three months, the British and their Tory allies turned what appeared to be a brilliant triumph into a dicey situation. In the northern districts along the North Carolina border, hundreds of Scots-Irish settlers flocked to join partisan bands headed by Thomas Sumter, William Hill, and others. On July 12, 1780, at Williamson\u2019s Plantation, partisans defeated elements of the hated British Legion. Over the next ninety days there were sixteen engagements in the northern districts. With the exception of defeats at Camden and Fishing Creek, the remainder were all partisan victories culminating in the smashing victory at King\u2019s Mountain. Losing more than one thousand soldiers killed, wounded, or captured so unnerved the British that Cornwallis delayed a planned invasion of North Carolina.\n\nThe situation deteriorated throughout the remainder of the year as partisans attacked isolated outposts and supply trains. Francis Marion operated at will in the northeastern portion of the state. Andrew Pickens led forces in the Savannah River Valley, and William Harden did the same in the lowcountry south of Charleston. Thomas Sumter continued his operations in the central and northern districts.\n\nIn December, Nathanael Greene appeared with a new Continental army. It was a turning point in the war. Unlike most regular military men who disliked and dismissed partisans, Greene coordinated their efforts with his own and kept the British continually off balance. By trading space for time, he planned a war of attrition that would eventually defeat a superior enemy force.\n\nShortly after his arrival in South Carolina, he divided his command, sending a large detachment under Daniel Morgan toward Ninety Six. As he had hoped, Cornwallis divided his army. On January 17, 1781, Morgan made a stand on the Broad River in Spartan District at Hiram Sanders\u2019s cowpens. For the first time in the Revolution, a regular British force broke and ran. Nearly one thousand of the enemy were killed or captured along with most of their supplies. The successful partisan operations, coupled with the victories at King\u2019s Mountain and Cowpens, had turned the tide in South Carolina in the Americans\u2019 favor. But the war had not yet been won.\n\nAfter Cowpens, Morgan moved swiftly into North Carolina to rejoin Greene\u2019s main army with Cornwallis right behind him. Eventually, after racing to the Dan River, Greene doubled back to Guilford Courthouse, where he engaged the British. When the fighting ended, the British held the field, but they had suffered heavy casualties. Cornwallis withdrew his tattered army to Wilmington and from there marched north to Virginia.\n\nGreene headed back to South Carolina. Facing him was a combined regular-Loyalist force of about eight thousand stationed in Charleston and at outposts from Georgetown to Ninety Six. The British may have controlled the strong points, but the countryside belonged to the partisans. With Greene\u2019s army to keep the main British forces occupied, the partisans picked off the enemy garrisons one by one.\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 1781 there were three major battles in the state. On April 25 at Hobkirk\u2019s Hill, the British won the battle but withdrew their garrison from Camden. At Ninety Six, Greene conducted an unsuccessful siege from May 22 to June 19, but the British abandoned the fort in June. At Eutaw Springs on September 8, in what was the bloodiest battle of the southern campaign, Greene initially held the field, but the British counterattacked and, at the end of the day, drove the Americans back. There were other battles after Eutaw Springs, but none of any strategic significance. On November 14, 1782, the last of the 137 battles fought in South Carolina and the last battle of the American Revolution occurred on Johns Island.\n\nBecause the British still occupied Charleston in January 1782, the General Assembly met in Jacksonborough. Under the protection of Greene\u2019s army, the legislature elected a new governor and passed two acts identifying and punishing Loyalists. The state was able to reassert its authority everywhere except for James Island and the Charleston peninsula.\n\nIn September 1782 a British fleet sailed into Charleston harbor to transport the remaining troops and the 4,200 Loyalists who wished to leave the state. On December 14, 1782, the last of the occupying troops withdrew block by block, and the city was turned over to Greene\u2019s army. At 3:00 p.m. Greene escorted Governor John Mathewes and other officials into the city. For South Carolina, the war was over.\n\nAfter thirty months of bloody fighting and brutal occupation, South Carolinians were once again in control of their own affairs\u2013 thanks to Nathanael Greene and local partisan leaders. The war may have begun and ended in Charleston, but it was won in the forests and swamps of the backcountry.\n\nFrom Ninety Six to Charleston the countryside was in ruins. Dwellings, farm buildings, and mills had been burned. Fields had been abandoned and had become overgrown. Livestock had been taken by one side or the other. There were thirty thousand fewer slaves in the state than there had been in 1775. The state\u2019s economy was in shambles.\n\nNot only were the means of production damaged or destroyed, but individuals and the state faced huge debts. South Carolina, with a white population of less than 100,000, had spent $5.4 million on the war effort. In spite of the difficulties facing it, the state had regularly met its financial obligations to the Continental Congress. In 1783 it was the only state to pay its requisition in full. The financial losses were nothing compared to the personal ones. In 1783 a visitor noted the large number of widows in Charleston, but there were far more in the backcountry. In Ninety Six District it was estimated that there were at least twelve hundred widows.\n\nThe American Revolution in South Carolina was a bloody, desperate struggle\u2013America\u2019s first civil war. Because of the nature of the conflict, it is impossible to know exactly how many Carolinians perished. However, of the total number of American casualties for the entire war, eighteen percent of those killed and thirty-one percent of those wounded fell in South Carolina during the last two years of fighting. Given the material and human losses, it is no small wonder that the American historian George Bancroft would write: \u201cLeft mainly to her own resources, it was through the depths of wretchedness that her sons were to bring her back to her place in the republic . . . having suffered more, and dared more, and achieved more than the men of any other state.\u201d\n\nBuchanan, John.

Yet, American Patriots like General and South Carolina plantation owner Andrew Williamson had other ideas in mind for this Loyalist force as he hoped to turn the tide in the backcountry in favor of the Whigs. American Colonel Andrew Pickens had been on the trail of Boyd\u2019s men. On the morning of February 14th, 1779, Pickens and his backcountry Whig militiamen, fiercely ambushed Loyalist forces at Kettle Creek. While Boyd\u2019s Loyalists greatly outnumbered the American militiamen, the element of surprise ultimately led to an American victory.\n\nIn the aftermath of battle, a number of Loyalists were taken prisoner.\n\nIn the Carolina backcountry there was an ongoing fear that residents would turn to the British cause. Before hearing the result of the attack at Kettle Creek, Williamson had already decided that [if victorious] Pickens\u2019 prisoners would serve as a deterrent to future American defectors in the backcountry. Hoping to avert more Loyalists from picking up arms, Williamson wrote,\n\n\u201cOur eyes are now opened and not with standing the lenity hitherto shown them they have at this crisis given convincing proofs, and that no faith should or ought be placed in their most solumn assurance and a severe example must certainly be made for the benefit of the State, and as a terror to others.\u201d\n\nWilliamson learned of the American victory at Kettle Creek by February 20th. He was pleased to hear that a handful of his Carolina neighbors would be turned into \u201csevere examples.\u201d While only twenty or so Loyalists were captured at Kettle Creek, the group of prisoners were treated more like cattle than men. Many of the prisoners were suffering from battle wounds. The group was marched to Augusta, Georgia in chains and put in the bullpen of Old Fort Augusta. They were later joined by 78 Kettle Creek Loyalists who had turned themselves over to Williamson on the false promise that they would be released and posted bond if they were to come to his camp. Other loyalists joined the Kettle Creek prisoners and soon the numbers swelled to more than 150 prisoners. The main distinction between the prisoners held at Augusta and other prisoners held during the war was that these men were not treated as prisoners of war, but instead as pure criminals. As criminals, these men were to be put on trial in the town of Ninety Six. Led by Colonel John Williams\u2019 regiment, the prisoners were marched from Augusta, Georgia to Ninety Six, South Carolina with a brief stop at General Williamson\u2019s bull pen. The prisoners arrived at the brick jail of Ninety Six by March 10th, 1779.\n\nWhile South Carolina Governor John Rutledge ordered the trials to start on March 9th, they were postponed until March 22nd. Sheriff of Ninety Six, William Moore, was charged with the task of selecting members of the jury. While the court proceedings have been lost to time, we do know basic facts and figures surrounding the trials. Approximately 75 men were released. According to the Gazette of the State of South Carolina, another 50 men were given reprieves after being found guilty because\u2026\n\n\u201cit appeared upon their trials, that most of them had been seduced and terrified into the fatal step, by Boyd, and a number of people who frequently came amongst them from North Carolina, under a variety of pretenses; and for want of proper information on the nature of our contest with Great Britain.\u201d\n\nAnd the remaining group of approximately 20 Loyalists were sentenced to death. The trials concluded on April 12th.\n\nOne Loyalist by the name of Zachariahs Gibbes described the treatment of these condemned prisoners as cruel, saying that the prisoners were forced to look at the holes that were to be their future graves as well as the gallows they were to be hanged from. While sentenced to die on April 19th, these Loyalists seemed to strike luck when a writ of habeas corpus from Governor Rutledge came on that very day to halt the hangings. The Loyalist prisoners on death row were then moved to Orangeburg, South Carolina, where they were kept in the town\u2019s blockhouse.\n\nAll the while, the British were ablaze with frustration as they attempted to have the accused Loyalist prisoners released or exchanged as prisoners of war. Unsuccessful, some British officials penned threats to the Americans. British Colonel James Mark Prevost wrote directly to Williamson to emphasize the consequences that would befall the American Whigs if any harm was done to his majesties \u201cfaithful subjects...\" Williamson retorted that the men being held prisoner had\u2026 \u201cdaringly taken up arms against, and wantonly plundered the honest and industrious inhabitants of this state [South Carolina], were properly secured and delivered up to the civil law.\u201d General Moultrie and Major Thomas Pinckney also received fiery requests from British officials, but the Americans insisted that the prisoners were being held under the tenets of civil law. Prevost considered revenge by exacting punishment on his Whig prisoners, but was persuaded by the threat of American backlash against other British prisoners.\n\nThe British threat however loomed on the minds of Patriot authorities. In effect, South Carolina officials started to question the consequences of moving forward with the execution of the prisoners at Orangeburg. They pondered the safety of themselves, their families, and their property if they pushed the British to react. Thus, when British Lieutenant Colonel Prevost launched an invasion into South Carolina in April of 1779, all but 5 of the Loyalist prisoners were granted reprieves. The last of the 5 prisoners were returned to Ninety Six where they were to receive their fatal punishment.\n\nSheriff William Moore oversaw the hangings of Charles Draper, John Anderson, James Lindley, Samuel Clegg, and Aquilla Hall. It was said that these men had committed cruel unforgivable acts against their patriot counterparts.\n\nThe men at the forefront of the trials and executions, Sheriff Moore and General Williamson, paid the consequences they so feared and ended up in British hands as the Redcoats took control of South Carolina in 1780. Moore was actually held in the same jail in Ninety Six as the Loyalist prisoners had once been in 1779. Meanwhile, Williamson surrendered himself to the British and accepted parole. He claimed that he had been working with the British all along\u2026 giving him the debated title of \u201cArnold of the South.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.scencyclopedia.org/sce/entries/james-john/", "page_content": "Soldier, legislator. John James, son of William James and Elizabeth Witherspoon, was born in Ireland on April 12, 1732. The family migrated to Prince Frederick\u2019s Parish, South Carolina, shortly after his birth and James grew to be a prominent planter with large landholdings. Before the Revolutionary War, James owned at least 2,114 acres, including 354 acres on the Black River, 950 acres on the Waccamaw River, 710 acres along the Little Pee Dee River and Lynches Creek, and 100 acres near Indiantown in Williamsburg County. He married Jean Dobein on January 18, 1753. They had five children.\n\nJames gained his first military experience as a captain in the provincial militia during the Cherokee War (1759\u20131761). In 1775 and 1776 he participated in the Second Provincial Congress and the First General Assembly, representing Prince Frederick\u2019s Parish. At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he was elected a captain in the state militia and served in the defense of Charleston under General William Moultrie, commanding a force of 120 men at a skirmish at Tulifinny Bridge in 1779. Fortunately for James, he was not among those who surrendered when the British captured Charleston in May 1780, having been ordered by Governor John Rutledge to raise a militia unit in the Williamsburg Township region.\n\nWilliam Dobein James, John James\u2019s second son, relates the story that after the fall of Charleston, the British demanded loyalty oaths from paroled Americans. James was chosen by the local inhabitants to meet with British authorities in Georgetown to ask if the oaths included the obligation to take up arms against their neighbors still in rebellion. Meeting with a British officer in Georgetown, James was told that not only their loyalty but also their service for the king was demanded. The unarmed James, believing he was being threatened, retreated from the meeting brandishing a chair in front of him. Once clear of the officer, he returned to Williamsburg to report the event. The news of this incident, and that of General Horatio Gates arriving in North Carolina to take charge of a new American army, induced the Williamsburg patriots to return to arms against the British. Once again, James was elected to lead them.\n\nJames turned his militia force over to Francis Marion in August 1781 at Witherspoon\u2019s Ferry on Lynches Creek. James served under Marion as a major and took part in several skirmishes against the British, including the Battle of Eutaw Springs (September 8, 1781). Shortly after the battle, he was elected to the state legislature and served in the Fourth General Assembly (1782). After the Revolution, he worked to restore his properties, which were heavily damaged during the war, and was again elected to public service, representing Prince Frederick\u2019s Parish in the Sixth General Assembly (1785\u20131786). James died on January 29, 1791, and was buried at Indiantown Presbyterian Church.\n\nBailey, N. Louise, and Elizabeth Ivey Cooper, eds.

R. Presbyterian Church cemetery in Newberry County, SC.\n\nNo one is sure just when James Blair came to SC but he was living in the colony prior to the Revolutionary War.\n\nThere is the possibility James could have come to SC with his father who, per family lore, was a William Blair. A number of James Blairs came into the SC colony in the early 1770s before the Revolutionary War. One settled in Chester County and there has been confusion over which James is which. Members of the Blair Genealogical Society have accounted for all but one. A James Blair arrived in Charleston on the ship Pennsylvania Farmer in 1772 and petitioned for 350 acres of land under the SC land Bounty Act. Based on how the land act awarded acreage, this would mean James was accompanied by five family members - 100 acres for him and 50 acres for each of the other family members. There is no record of a James Blair being awarded 350 acres - 250 is most received by a James Blair and this in Chester County. It is possible this James' petition was never granted. The problem the James' in this bio is his children were born after 1772, which would rule him out as being the James on the Pennsylvania Farmer - unless he was eventually awarded land with less acreage.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Farmer was one of five ships which brought a number of persons over from Great Britain as part of the contingent called by Rev. William Marten. Rev. Marten established a Presbyterian church \"on Rocky Mountain Road, 15 miles SE of Chester.\" One of the other ships was the James and Mary which had 183 persons on board. No passenger list for this ship has been found and it is possible James was aboard this ship.\n\nA James Blair fought in the Revolutionary War. His tombstone, erected by sons James and George Blair, has the term \"Revolutionary Patriot\" inscribed. A James Blair is listed as serving in the militia during 1780, 1781 and 1782. In June 1780, he was a horseman under Col. Hill and in April and July 1781 he was under Capt. Garrison and Col. Bratton. In October 1780, he was under Capt. Robert Faris and Col. Hill. During 1782, he was under a Capt. Hind (Hinds) and Col. Bratton. At some time, he was under a Capt. Walker. There are three records for a James Blair receiving payment for Revolutionary War service. On 4 April 1785, he received Seventeen Pounds, One Shilling Sterling for hire of \"waggon,\" team and driver 62 days in militia use in 1778 and 1779. On 12 April 1785, he received one hundred and ten pounds and 6 pence sterling for continental and militia use. On 21 May 1785, he received over 16 pounds sterling for 193 days militia duty in 1780, 1781, and 1782.\n\nAbout three individuals have claimed the above service records for their James Blair. It is hard to determine from the records which service is tied to which James.\n\nJames married Jane Streight based on an entry in the Newberry County S.C. Probate Estate Abstracts, Vol 1, for the estate of a George Streight and stating he had \"a daughter named \"Jennet w/o James Blair.\" It is assumed Jennet and Jane are the same person. In addition, James Blair is listed as an executor of the estate.

A legal scholar, he avoided the burly-burly of state politics, preferring to work behind the scenes. But he was devoted to the idea of a permanent union of the newly independent states and loyally supported fellow Virginians James Madison and George Washington at the Constitutional Convention. His greatest contribution as a Founding Father came not in Philadelphia, but later as a judge on the Virginia court of appeals and on the US. Supreme Court, where he influenced the interpretation of the Constitution in a number of important decisions. Contemporaries praised Blair for such personal strengths as gentleness and benevolence, and for his ability to penetrate immediately to the heart of a legal question.\n\nCAREER BEFORE THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. Blair was a member of a prominent Virginia family. His father served on the Virginia Council and was for a time acting Royal governor. His grand-uncle, James Blair, was founder and first president of the College of William and Mary. Blair attended William and Mary and in 1775 went to London to study law at the Middle Temple. Returning home to practice law, he was quickly thrust into public life, beginning his public career shortly after the close of the French and Indian War with his election to the seat reserved for the College of William and Mary in the House of Burgesses (1766-70). He went on to become clerk of the Royal Governor's Council, the upper house of the colonial legislature (1770-75).\n\nBlair originally joined the moderate wing of the Patriot cause. He opposed Patrick Henry's extremist resolutions in protest of the Stamp Act, but the dissolution of the House of Burgesses by Parliament profoundly altered his views. In response to a series of Parliamentary taxes on the colonies, Blair joined George Washington and others in 1770 and again in 1774 to draft nonimportation agreements which pledged their supporters to cease importing British goods until the taxes were repealed. In the latter year he reacted to Parliament's passage of the Intolerable Acts by joining those calling for a Continental Congress and pledging support for the people of Boston who were suffering economic hardship because of Parliament's actions.\n\nWhen the Revolution began, Blair became deeply involved in the government of his state. He served as a member of the convention that drew up Virginia's constitution (1776) and held a number of important committee positions, including a seat on the Committee of 28 that framed Virginia's Declaration of Rights and plan of government. He served on the Privy Council, Governor Patrick Henry's major advisory group (1776-78). The legislature elected him to a judgeship in the general court in 1778 and soon thereafter to the post of chief justice. He was also elected to Virginia's high court of chancery (1780), where his colleague was George Wythe, later a fellow delegate to the Constitutional Convention. These judicial appointments automatically made Blair a member of Virginia's first court of appeals. In 1786, the legislature, recognizing Blair's prestige as a jurist, appointed him Thomas Jefferson's successor on a committee revising Virginia's laws.\n\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. Although a faithful attendee, Blair never addressed the Convention nor sat on any of its committees. When the question of how the President should be elected arose, he joined George Mason and Edmund Randolph in advocating election by the Congress, thus splitting the Virginia delegation. Coming to realize that his stand was weakening his delegation in the voting process and impeding the progress of the Convention, he abandoned his position and voted with Washington and Madison, whom, as a stalwart nationalist, he supported for the remainder of the Convention.\n\nCAREER AFTER THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. Blair returned to Williamsburg, where he supported the new Constitution in a heated ratification struggle that pitted him and his colleagues against opponents who included some of the greatest orators of the day.\n\nHe continued to sit on the Virginia court of appeals, where he made a number of decisions important in the formation of Virginia jurisprudence. In Commonwealth vs. Posey, he based his decision on a 200-year-old precedent in English Common Law, thus establishing as a principle in American law that the accepted judicial understanding of a statute forms a part of the law itself and must be adhered to. More importantly, he and his colleagues on the court drafted a Remonstrance of the Judges that was successful in defending judges from the jurisdiction of the state legislature, thus preserving the principle of separation of powers in the state.\n\nPresident George Washington, Blair's longtime friend, chose him to be an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court (1789-96), where he was involved in several important constitutional cases. Well known as a strict constructionist, Blair could find no solution in the clauses of the Constitution to the question posed by Chisolm vs. Georgia concerning the right of an individual to sue a state. The Chisolm case led directly to the passage of the Eleventh Amendment, which declared that the states were immune from citizens' suits. Blair considered the separation of powers the basis of political liberty. When Congress passed an act in 1792 subjecting certain judicial decisions to legislative review, Blair was among the justices who, using arguments from the Remonstrance, attacked the act as an infringement upon the independence of the courts. From the bench he also pressed his view that the central government had precedence over the governments of the states. In Penhallow et al. vs. Doane's Administrators, Blair asserted this primacy by defending the power of the federal circuit courts to overturn the decisions of the state maritime courts.\n\nPERSONAL DATA\n\nBORN: 1732 (exact date unknown), in Williamsburg, Virginia\n\nDEATH: 31 August 1800, in Williamsburg\n\nINTERMENT: Graveyard of Bruton Parish Church, Williamsburg, Virginia\n\n[150-151]"}, {"url": "https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers-south-carolina", "page_content": "The Founding Fathers: South Carolina\n\nPierce Butler, South Carolina\n\nOne of the most aristocratic delegates at the convention, Butler was born in 1744 in County Carlow, Ireland. His father was Sir Richard Butler, member of Parliament and a baronet.\n\nLike so many younger sons of the British aristocracy who could not inherit their fathers' estates because of primogeniture, Butler pursued a military career. He became a major in His Majesty's 29th Regiment and during the colonial unrest was posted to Boston in 1768 to quell disturbances there. In 1771 he married Mary Middleton, daughter of a wealthy South Carolinian, and before long resigned his commission to take up a planter's life in the Charleston area. The couple was to have at least one daughter.\n\nWhen the Revolution broke out, Butler took up the Whig cause. He was elected to the assembly in 1778, and the next year he served as adjutant general in the South Carolina militia. While in the legislature through most of the 1780s, he took over leadership of the democratic upcountry faction in the state and refused to support his own planter group. The War for Independence cost him much of his property, and his finances were so precarious for a time that he was forced to travel to Amsterdam to seek a personal loan. In 1786 the assembly appointed him to a commission charged with settling a state boundary dispute.\n\nThe next year, Butler won election to both the Continental Congress (1787-88) and the Constitutional Convention. In the latter assembly, he was an outspoken nationalist who attended practically every session and was a key spokesman for the Madison-Wilson caucus. Butler also supported the interests of southern slaveholders. He served on the Committee on Postponed Matters.\n\nOn his return to South Carolina Butler defended the Constitution but did not participate in the ratifying convention. Service in the U.S. Senate (1789-96) followed. Although nominally a Federalist, he often crossed party lines. He supported Hamilton's fiscal program but opposed Jay's Treaty and Federalist judiciary and tariff measures.\n\nOut of the Senate and back in South Carolina from 1797 to 1802, Butler was considered for but did not attain the governorship. He sat briefly in the Senate again in 1803-4 to fill out an unexpired term, and he once again demonstrated party independence. But, for the most part, his later career was spent as a wealthy planter. In his last years, he moved to Philadelphia, apparently to be near a daughter who had married a local physician. Butler died there in 1822 at the age of 77 and was buried in the yard of Christ Church.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Archives, Records of Exposition, Anniversary, and Memorial Commissions (148-CCD-81a)\n\nCharles Pinckney, South Carolina\n\nCharles Pinckney, the second cousin of fellow-signer Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, was born at Charleston, SC, in 1757. His father, Col. Charles Pinckney, was a rich lawyer and planter, who on his death in 1782 was to bequeath Snee Farm, a country estate outside the city, to his son Charles. The latter apparently received all his education in the city of his birth, and he started to practice law there in 1779.\n\nAbout that time, well after the War for Independence had begun, young Pinckney enlisted in the militia, though his father demonstrated ambivalence about the Revolution. He became a lieutenant, and served at the siege of Savannah (September-October 1779). When Charleston fell to the British the next year, the youth was captured and remained a prisoner until June 1781.\n\nPinckney had also begun a political career, serving in the Continental Congress (1777-78 and 1784-87) and in the state legislature (1779-80, 1786-89, and 1792-96). A nationalist, he worked hard in Congress to ensure that the United States would receive navigation rights to the Mississippi and to strengthen congressional power.\n\nPinckney's role in the Constitutional Convention is controversial. Although one of the youngest delegates, he later claimed to have been the most influential one and contended he had submitted a draft that was the basis of the final Constitution. Most historians have rejected this assertion. They do, however, recognize that he ranked among the leaders. He attended full time, spoke often and effectively, and contributed immensely to the final draft and to the resolution of problems that arose during the debates. He also worked for ratification in South Carolina (1788). That same year, he married Mary Eleanor Laurens, daughter of a wealthy and politically powerful South Carolina merchant; she was to bear at least three children.\n\nSubsequently, Pinckney's career blossomed. From 1789 to 1792 he held the governorship of South Carolina, and in 1790 chaired the state constitutional convention. During this period, he became associated with the Federalist Party, in which he and his cousin Charles Cotesworth Pinckney were leaders. But, with the passage of time, the former's views began to change. In 1795 he attacked the Federalist backed Jay's Treaty and increasingly began to cast his lot with Carolina back-country Democratic-Republicans against his own eastern aristocracy. In 1796 he became governor once again, and in 1798 his Democratic-Republican supporters helped him win a seat in the U.S. Senate. There, he bitterly opposed his former party, and in the presidential election of 1800 served as Thomas Jefferson's campaign manager in South Carolina.\n\nThe victorious Jefferson appointed Pinckney as Minister to Spain (1801-5), in which capacity he struggled valiantly but unsuccessfully to win cession of the Floridas to the United States and facilitated Spanish acquiescence in the transfer of Louisiana from France to the United States in 1803.\n\nUpon completion of his diplomatic mission, his ideas moving ever closer to democracy, Pinckney headed back to Charleston and to leadership of the state Democratic-Republican Party. He sat in the legislature in 1805-6 and then was again elected as governor (1806-8). In this position, he favored legislative reapportionment, giving better representation to back-country districts, and advocated universal white manhood suffrage. He served again in the legislature from 1810 to 1814 and then temporarily withdrew from politics. In 1818 he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he fought against the Missouri Compromise.\n\nIn 1821, Pinckney's health beginning to fail, he retired for the last time from politics. He died in 1824, just 3 days after his 67th birthday. He was laid to rest in Charleston at St. Philip's Episcopal Churchyard.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Archives, Records of Exposition, Anniversary, and Memorial Commissions (148-CCD-54)\n\nCharles Cotesworth Pinckney, South Carolina\n\nThe eldest son of a politically prominent planter and a remarkable mother who introduced and promoted indigo culture in South Carolina, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney was born in 1746 at Charleston. Only 7 years later, he accompanied his father, who had been appointed colonial agent for South Carolina, to England. As a result, the youth enjoyed a European education.\n\nPinckney received tutoring in London, attended several preparatory schools, and went on to Christ Church College, Oxford, where he heard the lectures of the legal authority Sir William Blackstone and graduated in 1764. Pinckney next pursued legal training at London's Middle Temple and was accepted for admission into the English bar in 1769. He then spent part of a year touring Europe and studying chemistry, military science, and botany under leading authorities.\n\nLate in 1769, Pinckney sailed home and the next year entered practice in South Carolina. His political career began in 1769, when he was elected to the provincial assembly. In 1773 he acted as attorney general for several towns in the colony. By 1775 he had identified with the patriot cause and that year sat in the provincial congress. Then, the next year, he was elected to the local committee of safety and made chairman of a committee that drew up a plan for the interim government of South Carolina.\n\nWhen hostilities broke out, Pinckney, who had been a royal militia officer since 1769, pursued a full-time military calling. When South Carolina organized its forces in 1775, he joined the First South Carolina Regiment as a captain. He soon rose to the rank of colonel and fought in the South in defense of Charleston and in the North at the Battles of Brandywine, PA, and Germantown, PA. He commanded a regiment in the campaign against the British in the Floridas in 1778 and at the siege of Savannah. When Charleston fell in 1780, he was taken prisoner and held until 1782. The following year, he was discharged as a brevet brigadier general.\n\nAfter the war, Pinckney resumed his legal practice and the management of estates in the Charleston area but found time to continue his public service, which during the war had included tours in the lower house of the state legislature (1778 and 1782) and the senate (1779).\n\nPinckney was one of the leaders at the Constitutional Convention. Present at all the sessions, he strongly advocated a powerful national government. His proposal that senators should serve without pay was not adopted, but he exerted influence in such matters as the power of the Senate to ratify treaties and the compromise that was reached concerning abolition of the international slave trade. After the convention, he defended the Constitution in South Carolina.\n\nUnder the new government, Pinckney became a devoted Federalist. Between 1789 and 1795 he declined presidential offers to command the U.S. Army and to serve on the Supreme Court and as Secretary of War and Secretary of State. In 1796, however, he accepted the post of Minister to France, but the revolutionary regime there refused to receive him and he was forced to proceed to the Netherlands. The next year, though, he returned to France when he was appointed to a special mission to restore relations with that country. During the ensuing XYZ affair, refusing to pay a bribe suggested by a French agent to facilitate negotiations, he was said to have replied \"No! No! Not a sixpence!\"\n\nWhen Pinckney arrived back in the United States in 1798, he found the country preparing for war with France. That year, he was appointed as a major general in command of American forces in the South and served in that capacity until 1800, when the threat of war ended. That year, he represented the Federalists as Vice-Presidential candidate, and in 1804 and 1808 as the Presidential nominee. But he met defeat on all three occasions.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Pinckney engaged in legal practice, served at times in the legislature, and engaged in philanthropic activities. He was a charter member of the board of trustees of South Carolina College (later the University of South Carolina), first president of the Charleston Bible Society, and chief executive of the Charleston Library Society. He also gained prominence in the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of former officers of the War for Independence.\n\nDuring the later period of his life, Pinckney enjoyed his Belmont estate and Charleston high society. He was twice married; first to Sarah Middleton in 1773 and after her death to Mary Stead in 1786. Survived by three daughters, he died in Charleston in 1825 at the age of 79. He was interred there in the cemetery at St. Michael's Episcopal Church.\n\nImage: Courtesy of National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution\n\nJohn Rutledge, South Carolina\n\nJohn Rutledge, elder brother of Edward Rutledge, signer of the Declaration of Independence, was born into a large family at or near Charleston, SC, in 1739. He received his early education from his father, an Irish immigrant and physician, and from an Anglican minister and a tutor. After studying law at London's Middle Temple in 1760, he was admitted to English practice. But, almost at once, he sailed back to Charleston to begin a fruitful legal career and to amass a fortune in plantations and slaves. Three years later, he married Elizabeth Grimke, who eventually bore him 10 children, and moved into a townhouse, where he resided most of the remainder of his life.\n\nIn 1761 Rutledge became politically active. That year, on behalf of Christ Church Parish, he was elected to the provincial assembly and held his seat until the War for Independence. For 10 months in 1764 he temporarily held the post of provincial attorney general. When the troubles with Great Britain intensified about the time of the Stamp Act in 1765, Rutledge, who hoped to ensure continued self-government for the colonies, sought to avoid severance from the British and maintained a restrained stance. He did, however, chair a committee of the Stamp Act Congress that drew up a petition to the House of Lords.\n\nIn 1774 Rutledge was sent to the First Continental Congress, where he pursued a moderate course. After spending the next year in the Second Continental Congress, he returned to South Carolina and helped reorganize its government. In 1776 he served on the committee of safety and took part in the writing of the state constitution. That year, he also became president of the lower house of the legislature, a post he held until 1778. During this period, the new government met many stern tests.\n\nIn 1778 the conservative Rutledge, disapproving of democratic revisions in the state constitution, resigned his position. The next year, however, he was elected as governor. It was a difficult time. The British were invading South Carolina, and the military situation was desperate. Early in 1780, by which time the legislature had adjourned, Charleston was besieged. In May it fell, the American army was captured, and the British confiscated Rutledge's property. He ultimately escaped to North Carolina and set about attempting to rally forces to recover South Carolina. In 1781, aided by Gen. Nathanael Greene and a new Continental Army force, he reestablished the government. In January 1782 he resigned the governorship and took a seat in the lower house of the legislature. He never recouped the financial losses he suffered during the war.\n\nIn 1782-83 Rutledge was a delegate to the Continental Congress. He next sat on the state chancery court (1784) and again in the lower house of the legislature (1784-90). One of the most influential delegates at the Constitutional Convention, where he maintained a moderate nationalist stance and chaired the Committee of Detail, he attended all the sessions, spoke often and effectively, and served on five committees. Like his fellow South Carolina delegates, he vigorously advocated southern interests.\n\nThe new government under the Constitution soon lured Rutledge. He was a Presidential elector in 1789 and Washington then appointed him as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, but for some reason he apparently served only a short time. In 1791 he became chief justice of the South Carolina supreme court. Four years later, Washington again appointed him to the U.S. Supreme Court, this time as Chief Justice to replace John Jay. But Rutledge's outspoken opposition to Jay's Treaty (1794), and the intermittent mental illness he had suffered from since the death of his wife in 1792, caused the Federalist-dominated Senate to reject his appointment and end his public career. Meantime, however, he had presided over one term of the Court.\n\nRutledge died in 1800 at the age of 60 and was interred at St. Michael's Episcopal Church in Charleston.\n\nImage: Courtesy of The J.B.
