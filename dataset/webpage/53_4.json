The enterprise was funded by the singer Cilla Black and Peter Brown of Apple, the Beatles's record company. Describing his first look Nutter said: 'Everybody was wearing a narrow suit at the end of the 1960s ... so I just went wild with the lapels and cut them as wide as you possibly could - enormous - and it was terribly flared at the jacket. So that was my first look and it was different from anybody else.' Tommy Nutter\u2019s celebrity clientele included Mick Jagger. Eric Clapton and the Beatles, who are pictured wearing his suits on the front cover of 'Abbey Road'. Such connections enabled Nutter to introduce high fashion to Savile Row and thus effect enormous influence on British menswear.\n\n\n\nThis suit was given by Sir Roy Strong, author, broadcaster, former Director of the National Portrait Gallery and from 1974 to1987, Director and Secretary of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Dating to around 1980, this suit was worn by Sir Roy for public and formal occasions in his capacity as Museum Director. Sir Roy became known for his vigorous support of modern design and was also recognised for his own sartorial flair."}, {"url": "https://savilerow-style.com/news/tommy-nutter-rebel-cause/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter, the tailor who ripped up the rules of Savile Row, is remembered in a new biography. Tom Corby reports\n\nJust over a quarter of a century after his untimely death from Aids, the avant-garde Tommy Nutter, like so many creatives of his generation, is still regarded as a legend, remembered as the tailor who single-handedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row with the male peacock revolution of 1960s swinging London. His contribution to some of the most iconic styles and pop imagery of the 20th century has become part of the history of his trade as he wore down the division between tailoring and fashion. Friends say that a statue ought to be put up of him, like that of Beau Brummel, the archetypal dandy who, in the 18th century, set the bespoke style for generations.\n\nTommy spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father owned a caf\u00e9, catering, in the main, to customers like truck drivers, gas fitters and builders. He was destined to be a plumber but, over the years, emerged as a blue collar boy made good in the class crucible of the 60s; a time when the alchemy of taste, cool, and sheer force of personality could transform lives in ways that would have seemed impossible in years gone by. Tommy, a 6ft 2 inches tall young man with matinee idol looks, arrived right on cue. It all started when, aged 19, he broke free from plumbing to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. He then landed an apprenticeship with Donaldson, Williamson and Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors, with premises in Burlington Arcade. There, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentlemen\u2019s classic wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thorough knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its hierarchy.\n\nIn 1969, Tommy founded his own business, joining up with Edward Sexton, a young cutter with brilliant technical skills. They were financially backed by Tommy\u2019s close friend, the singer Cilla Black, her husband Bobby Willis and others prepared to take a risk. The venture was an immediate success although a writer in the Daily Mirror snarked: \u201cThomas Nutter is opening what he calls a \u2018thoroughly square\u2019 tailoring shop \u2026 in Savile Row next week. Well that will make a change. I mean there can\u2019t be more than a dozen there now. Mr Nutter, who is 26, is weary of \u2018all those Carnaby Street gimmicks\u2019, and thinks that clothes, like hair, are settling down to something more sober \u2026 What, then, of rumours that Ringo Starr has ordered a pair of scarlet PVC trousers from Nutters?\u201d Tommy replied curtly: \u201cThey\u2019ll be very square scarlet PVC trousers.\u201d\n\nSavile Row, with its collection of Royal Warrants, had never seen anything like it when Nutters opened at No. 35a, the story of which has been brought back to life by Lance Richardson in his biography House of Nutter \u2013 The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row. A year on, the Daily Mail was declaring it \u201ca whizz bang success \u2013 the place for men\u2019s clothes\u201d, putting the charismatic Tommy in the class of actor Terence Stamp, photographer Brian Duffy, and hair dresser Vidal Sassoon, all the stylish young Londoners who had shot themselves into the new aristocracy. Clients came in from the hipper haunts of those named in Debrett\u2019s, from the media, pop stars and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End, whose ambition was to own a Nutter suit, drawn to Tommy not only because of his matchless sense of style, but also because of his personality. He welcomed them all.\n\nLike Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy who dressed The Queen, Tommy produced lively, contemporary tailoring, but with roots deeply embedded in the craftsmanship of Savile Row. Amies named Tommy as \u201cthe most exciting tailor on Savile Row in decades.\u201d For three decades, Tommy kitted out the biggest stars on both sides of the Atlantic. He was proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album, three of them wore Tommy Nutter bespoke. George Harrison chose\n\ndenim. Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong, then director of the National Portrait Gallery, Mick Jagger and Elton John. Andrew Lloyd Webber was also a client as well as a friend. He has recalled: \u201cThere was a wonderful maroon coat I wore for Ascot \u2013 he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on \u2013 Tommy made clothes for Tim Rice too \u2013 we were all great mates.\u201d\n\nMick Jagger sported an eau-de-nil three-piece for his wedding to Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971. He was in another Nutter creation days later on his honeymoon in Venice, fitted so snugly that it left no doubt as to which side he dressed. Celebrity nuptials became something of a thing for Tommy. John Lennon wore cream corduroy for his wedding to Yoko Ono on Gibraltar. For Elton John\u2019s marriage in 1984 Tommy made 20 suits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of mishap\u201d, as he later recalled, \u201cin a wide range of primary colours, including orange and very bright yellow. With each outfit went the appropriate straw boater.\u201d\n\nJohn Reid, Elton John\u2019s manager, has said: \u201cIt was quite an event going to Nutters. You\u2019d write the whole day off. Maybe you\u2019d have lunch and a couple of bottles of champagne.\u201d Tommy has said that when things became \u201cedgy\u201d with Elton he would send out for a bottle of sherry \u201cto smooth things along\u201d. For Elton\u2019s 36th birthday, Tommy made a suit overlaid with 1,009,444 bugle beads, each one painstakingly attached by hand. Tommy also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London, like the red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early 70s.\n\nPeople were attracted to Tommy not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but because of his ironic personality. He was a humorist with a wide and interesting circle of friends who were attracted by his enthusiasm, his gentle self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression, \u201cBut who am I to talk?\u201d He was a witty correspondent and his letters to his friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in London\u2019s Green Park.\n\nTommy died of Aids in August 1992, aged 49. \u201cThe saddest thing of all,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cis an in-between look.\u201d No-one could ever have accused him of that. At his memorial service in St George\u2019s, Hanover Square, just up the road from Savile Row, Cilla Black read an abridged excerpt from Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, relating the story of \u201cA true, a perfect gentle Knight \u2026 In dying in his excellence and flower, when he is certain of his high good name; for then he gives to friend, and self, no shame.\u201d\n\nThe final words should go to Nutters loyalist Elton John who said: \u201cTommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that\u2026\n\nHouse of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row by Lance Richardson, published by Chatto & Windus. \u00a325"}, {"url": "https://edinburghtailoringcompany.com/2023/05/29/who-are-tommy-nutter-and-edward-sexton-and-why-are-they-important/", "page_content": "Edward Sexton and Tommy Nutter are two of the most iconic names in Savile Row tailoring. Renowned for their creativity and skill, these two men were instrumental in revolutionizing the way men dress. Their partnership was known as the \u201cDynamic Duo of Savile Row\u201d, and they left an indelible mark on the fashion world. Through their dedication to fine craftsmanship and eye for detail, Edward Sexton and Tommy Nutter made Savile Row an international hub of bespoke tailoring.\n\nEdward Sexton \u2013 The Rebel Tailor\n\nEdward Sexton is a world-renowned tailor who has made a name for himself by breaking all the rules. His style is modern and sleek, while still maintaining the traditional look of a Savile Row suit. Sexton is the go-to tailor for many celebrities and has even made suits for the likes of Prince Charles and David Beckham.\n\nDespite his rebel status, Sexton is a true craftsman who takes great pride in his work. He is always pushing himself to create the perfect suit and strives to make each one better than the last. Sexton\u2019s style is all about bespoke, handmade garments that are designed to fit the individual wearer perfectly. He is also known for his use of bold and unconventional fabrics, which has helped him to create some truly unique looks.\n\nHe\u2019s worked with some of the biggest names in the music and fashion industry, and his suits are loved for their sharp lines and slim fits. He is known for his impeccable craftsmanship and attention to detail. His work has been featured in many major publications, including Vogue, Harper\u2019s Bazaar, and Esquire. He has also been featured on television shows such as BBC\u2019s The Clothes Show and Channel 4\u2019s How to Look Good Naked.\n\nSexton\u2019s work is truly remarkable, and he is considered to be one of the best tailors in the world. If you are looking for a tailor who can help you to create a truly individual look, then Edward Sexton is the man for you.\n\nTommy Nutter \u2013 The Rockstar Tailor\n\nTommy Nutter was nothing short of a rockstar tailor. He was the son of a Chinese laundryman who arrived in London in the 1950s and found work as a tailor\u2019s apprentice. Nutter quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the most sought-after bespoke tailors in London. His clients included everyone from the Rolling Stones and the Beatles to the royal family.\n\nNutter was known for his flamboyant style and his willingness to take risks. He was the first tailor to put his name on the label of his suits, and he was also the first to use unusual materials like leather and denim. His bold style helped to redefine menswear in the 1960s and 1970s, and his influence can still be seen today.\n\nHe was the youngest of three brothers and began his career working in his father\u2019s tailor shop. In 1966, Nutter moved to New York City and began working as a personal assistant to the Hollywood film producer David O. Selznick. After a few years in New York, Nutter returned to London and opened his own tailor shop on Savile Row. He quickly gained a reputation for his unique style and became known as the \u201cRockstar tailor.\u201d Nutter\u2019s clients included some of the biggest names in the music and fashion industries, such as The Beatles, Mick Jagger, and Twiggy.\n\nNutter\u2019s career came to an abrupt end in 1992 when he died of a heart attack at the age of 49. However, his legacy lives on through his masterpieces.\n\nHow these two came together\n\nWhen two of the most renowned tailors in the world come together, the result is bound to be special. In 1969, two young tailors from Savile Row, Tommy Nutter, and Edward Sexton, joined forces to open a bespoke tailoring business on London\u2019s iconic Bruton Street. Their goal was to create the best tailor-made suits in the world, and they quickly became known for their exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail.\n\nNutter, who was previously employed by the world-famous Savile Row tailor house Hardy Amies, brought his expert eye for detail and an appreciation for traditional craftsmanship to the partnership. Sexton, on the other hand, was known for his more modern approach to tailoring, which included shorter jacket lengths and bolder colour choices. The combination of Nutter and Sexton\u2019s talents resulted in some of the most iconic looks of the late 20th century. They were responsible for dressing some of the most famous names in the world, including the Beatles.\n\nNutter and Sexton\u2019s designs were sharp and modern, yet still classic and timeless. They were the perfect combination of form and function, and they quickly became the go-to tailors for some of the most famous names in the world. From the Rolling Stones to the Beatles, everyone who was anyone wanted a Nutter or Sexton suit.\n\nNutter and Sexton worked together for over a decade, creating some of the most iconic suits of the 1970s. Sadly, their partnership came to an end in 1980, when Nutter passed away. However, their legacy lives on, and their work continues to inspire fellow tailors and fashion lovers alike, including yours truly here at Edinburgh Tailoring Company.\n\nTheir Legacy and Influence on Fashion\n\nTommy Nutter and Edward Sexton were two of the most influential figures in the world of fashion in the 20th century. As Savile Row tailors, they revolutionized the way men dressed, and their influence can still be seen today. Tommy Nutter was known for his sharp, clean-cut suits, while Edward Sexton was known for his more reckless and experimental style. They were responsible for modernizing the look of Savile Row and helping to make it the world-renowned destination for bespoke menswear that it is today. While their style was very different from one another, both Nutter and Sexton had a profound impact on fashion. Their work helped to make Savile Row the go-to place for stylish and well-made clothing.\n\nBoth men left a lasting legacy in the world of fashion, and their influence can still be seen today. If you\u2019re a fan of Savile Row tailoring, then you owe a debt of gratitude to Tommy Nutter and Edward Sexton.\n\nHow do I get the look?\n\nSavile Row tailors Tommy Nutter and Edward Sexton revolutionized menswear in the 1960s and 1970s. By breaking away from the stuffy constrictions of traditional British tailoring, they created a new look that was fresh, modern, and stylish. Today, their legacy continues to inspire new generations of designers. Here at Edinburgh Tailoring Company, we often receive commissions from clients for tailoring with a difference.

In the last menswear fashion week in Milan, it was the likes of Corneliani, Ermenegildo Zegna and Salvatore Ferragamo -- renowned for their sartorial heritage and impeccable tailoring that stood out in the face of tremendously inventive competition. In London, new brands such as Hardy Amies, E. Tautz and A. Sauvage have injected new life onto Savile Row, the birthplace of bespoke tailoring, by celebrating and reinterpreting traditional designs and patterns. In addition, other global menswear names such as Lanvin and Abercrombie & Fitch have seen the benefit of setting up shop in Savile Row or in nearby arteries so that they would be associated with images of established heritage.\n\nIn this context, the exhibition Within the cavernous insides of the museum, the display of Nutter's garments and memorabilia is laid out as a representation of Savile Row, illustrating not only the role that Nutter had in revitalising the image of tailoring in the late 1960s and early 1970s but also how he influenced the current popularity of tailoring. Visitors are greeted with street signs, red brick walls, railings and shop windows displaying garments designed by Nutter, and are allowed glimpses into Nutter's world in the form of replicas of his workrooms and shop. In all its forms, this is an exhibition that adroitly portrays the reinvention of traditional tailoring throughout the recent history of menswear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTommy Nutter was working as a junior sales assistant when he met master cutter Edward Sexton. When they opened Nutters on Valentine's Day in 1969 on Savile Row, the duo combined contemporary styling with classic techniques to create the brand that set the Row swinging. The teaming of Nutter's innovative styling with Sexton's cutting expertise revolutionised menswear and took items such as \"Oxford\" bags, tight jackets and high waists into the mainstream. The shop (financed by Cilla Black, James Vallance White, and The Beatles' executive Peter Brown) opened up the experience of bespoke tailoring by catering to rock stars, artists and aristocrats who were keen to wear the new shapes and details pioneered at Nutters. The fa\u00e7ade of the shop was unprecedented and got the whole of Savile Row talking: an expanse of plate glass windows opened up the displaying and selling spaces and made the shop light and accessible, providing an insight into this once arcane and private world.\n\nAs Nutters broke the moulds of tailoring and shopping, the great and the good of swinging London flocked to the shop in droves. The shop's order books (on display at the exhibition) read like a roll call of the celebrities of the day: Mick Jagger, Elton John, The Beatles, Charlie Watts, Neil Sedaka, David Hockney, Andrew Lloyd Weber, Cilla Black and Twiggy were all clients. Most famously, Nutter created the suits for the wedding of Mick and Bianca Jagger. The fact that most of these clients kept their garments in perfect condition and loaned them to the present exhibition only proves how revered Nutter's talent still is.\n\nAfter leaving Nutter's of Savile Row in 1976, Tommy moved to the label Kilgour, where he created a collection under his own name. In 1988, he opened his eponymous shop on Savile Row where he continued to create distinctive suiting, and where Timothy Everest joined as an assistant and John Galliano served as an intern. During this time he created the memorable purple suit worn by Jack Nicholson's Joker character in Tim Burton's 'Batman' film, as well as the stage costumes for Elton John's Wembley shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTommy Nutter passed away in 1992 but his vision for menswear continues to have a strong influence on tailors and designers working today. Elton John's quote that \"Tommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible\" confirms that Nutter's role in opening up the physical and metaphorical borders of Savile Row was crucial for the development of menswear as it is now known. His audacious creations not only changed the way male dressing was perceived but elevated traditional tailoring techniques and ideas into the realm of fashion. Contemporary designers such as Tom Ford, Timothy Everest, Vivienne Westwood and Ozwald Boateng all pay tribute to the Nutter style by resorting to many of the original features that he developed, such as wide lapels, jackets with contrasting trimming, patchwork designs, jackets made of silk satin and velvet, and male shapes influenced by the 1920s and 1930s."}, {"url": "https://www.fashionmodeldirectory.com/designers/tommy-nutter/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter was a British tailor.\n\nTommy Nutter was born in 1943.\n\nIn his youth Nutter studied at the Tailor and Cutter Academy and worked for traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward.

Though most people knew him as the \"Tailor to the Stars\" -- the bon vivant Savile Row designer who dressed everyone from the Beatles and Elton John to Diana Ross and Twiggy -- his private life was where the most interesting things happened. From underground London clubs in the 1960s, before it was even legal to be gay, to the infamous bathhouses -- and trucks -- of hedonistic Manhattan at the height of the sexual '70s, Nutter was there, both witness and participant. His own biography is also, in miniature, the biography of gay life over the second half of the 20th century -- flagrantly joyful, traumatically brutal. In House of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row, Lance Richardson charts the story of one of fashion's most intriguing figures, including the AIDS diagnosis that would bring his life to an untimely end.\n\nThe crowd convened in Fulham's Eel Brook Common, opposite John Galliano's design studio. It was a brisk, blustery Sunday morning in April 1989. Clouds threatened rain with enough conviction that some people had brought their raincoats, though others were committed to their tutus and fairy wings, to showing off rainbow patch pants, Comme des Garcons jackets, antique neck scarves, and brown suede brogues. Roger Dack, the director of Fashion Acts, which had organized the event in London, strolled across the grass with a megaphone rallying his troops. Later, he would describe it as \"the most chic walk ever.\"\n\nMore than 900 marchers had turned up, pledging some PS90,000. The official route threaded up the King's Road, through Knightsbridge and Westminster, all the way over to Covent Garden, where the finish line was a Champagne reception at Tuttons restaurant. Bruce Oldfield stood at the front of the procession, itching to go; Galliano, lingering behind a battalion of strollers, brought up the rear.\n\nBut first, before anyone could take a single step forward, 1,116 red balloons were released into the sky: one for every person in the country who had died from AIDS-related causes.\n\nEarly in the epidemic, AIDS had been dismissed by some members of the British public as \"an American problem\" that would never creep its way across the Atlantic. Of course, it had already arrived; in 1982, a man named Terrence Higgins had collapsed on the dance floor at Heaven and died a few months later from Pneumocystis pneumonia. \"I hope you get very scared today because there is a locomotive coming down the track and it is leaving the United States,\" Mel Rosen, an American AIDS activist, had warned at a conference in London the following year. By late 1985, there were 241 cases of AIDS in Britain, and newspapers were reporting instances of \"scared\" firemen and paramedics who were refusing to perform the \"kiss of life,\" lest they get infected. In 1987, as conservatives talked seriously about compulsory testing of all gay men and possibly even mass quarantine, the science correspondent of the London Times wrote that \"leading specialists believe... between 40,000 and\n\n100,000 people in Britain are now carriers.\"\n\nAs the red balloons drifted into the sky above Fulham, Tommy Nutter took swigs from a hip flask to fortify himself for the long march to Covent Garden.\n\nThe first black spot had appeared on his own leg toward the end of the 1980s: small, dark, refusing to heal.\n\nStewart Grimshaw, one of Tommy's close friends, first noticed it when they were summering together in Saint-Tropez. Others noticed because Tommy drew their attention to it, making light of what the mark could possibly signify. When Carol Drinkwater read an article describing Kaposi's sarcoma lesions, the reddish-purple patches often associated with AIDS, she asked Tommy if he had anything like that. He replied, \"Yeah, yeah,\" indicated his leg, and shrugged away the question. But then the spot got worse, his health took a turn, and ignoring it became impossible.\n\nMany of the gay men Tommy knew went to St. Mary's Hospital, in Paddington, to be screened for sexually transmitted diseases. But Tommy refused; he hated being seen in that environment. Instead, he went to see Stewart, who, Tommy knew, had been actively involved in AIDS awareness since the days it was known as the dreaded \"gay cancer.\" As Stewart recalls, \"He came to me because he had loads of questions, and he thought I'd have all the answers.\"\n\nFor example: How many people get over it?\n\nStewart told him that nobody \"got over it.\"\n\nAnd how long before...?\n\nThat depends on your T-cell count, Stewart said.\n\nAfter Tommy exhausted his inquiry, Stewart convinced him to follow up with a brilliant clinician named Brian Gazzard. Having encountered his first case of what became identified as AIDS back in 1979, Gazzard was one of the leading medical authorities in Britain. He'd already seen hundreds of HIV-positive patients by the mid-1980s, and more recently, he'd been instrumental in setting up the Kobler Centre, a dedicated HIV/AIDS research and outpatient facility funded by a combination of private donations and money from the National Health Service. (Princess Diana opened the day-care wing during a well-publicized visit in 1988; it had been packed with patients ever since.) The Kobler saw \"a never-ending procession,\" Gazzard recalls, and the atmosphere was both depressing -- with up to 10 deaths a week -- and inspiring, because \"people were full of courage and determination.\"\n\nTommy made an appointment to see Dr. Gazzard, but he didn't want to go alone. He asked Stewart to keep him company.\n\nThe doctor sat them down in a quiet office. He told them that some people wanted to hear all the details, while others didn't want to hear any of the details.\n\nTommy said, \"Tell me everything.\"\n\n\"But that's not really what he wanted,\" Stewart recalls.\n\nWhat Tommy would have been told is something like this: That there is no easy way to break bad news. That, according to his test results, he was HIV-positive, with a very low CD4 cell count. That he already had opportunistic infections, and there was a good chance he would contract even more. That the treatments available to him were limited -- AZT, perhaps, though its effectiveness at prolonging life was finite and accompanied by side effects. That most types of treatment would focus on infections rather than the virus itself, which could not be cured. That there would be ways forward, however, to remain in control of the situation. Because that was the most frightening thing for patients newly cognizant of their status: the prospect of losing control.\n\nStewart listened carefully and understood exactly what was going to happen to his friend.\n\nTommy also listened, silent until the doctor finished and asked him if there was anything further he wanted to know.\n\nTommy thought for a moment. Then, Stewart remembers, he said, \"Yes, there is one thing I'd like to know. I'd like to know when Mack and Mabel is opening in the West End.\"\n\nMack and Mabel was an American musical by Michael Stewart and Jerry Herman that had premiered on Broadway in 1974, but thus far failed to transfer to London, except for a one-off charity performance at Drury Lane, in 1988. It told the tragic \"true\" (heavily fictionalized) story of Mabel Normand, a working-class girl who became a glamorous star of silent cinema before sliding into scandal and ultimately dying from pulmonary tuberculosis at the premature age of 37. Tommy had acquired a cast recording, and declared to several friends that it was his new favorite show.\n\nThe doctor stared at Tommy.\n\n\"I truly think he thought that Tommy already had dementia,\" Stewart recalls.\n\nWhen Tommy arrived home that evening, he telephoned Carol Drinkwater, whom he'd known since they met at a nightclub called La Douce in the early 1960s.\n\n\"What is it?\" Carol asked. She was standing in her upstairs bedroom.\n\n\"I've got AIDS,\" Tommy said.\n\nCarol took a deep breath. \"Tommy, you've got to be positive.\"\n\n\"I just said that,\" he snapped. \"I am 'positive.' \"\n\nOnce Tommy knew for sure that he had HIV, his first response was to make jokes, and his second was to adopt a kind of optimistic denial. \"In the first six months, he was very sure that something would be done and that he would be OK,\" recalls Tim Gallagher, one of the salesmen in Tommy's Savile Row emporium who had also become a close friend. \"I think he took it very well indeed.\" Occasionally, Tommy called up Stewart to ask some more questions: What about that new drug mentioned in the newspaper? What about this experimental form of treatment? But mostly he preferred not to discuss the situation at all, carrying on as though absolutely nothing had changed. Which is not to say, however, that he wasn't affected. His assistant, Wendy Samimi, spent enough time with Tommy to notice cracks in the carapace. Despite his demeanor of cool unconcern, she could tell that he was rattled. \"Would it affect his brain? Would he get all the sarcomas? It could manifest in so many different ways -- that's where his demons were about it.\"\n\nThese demons manifested most clearly whenever it came time for another doctor's appointment, now regular and essential. Visiting the Kobler meant Tommy could not pretend that everything was just the same; it forced him, for a few hours each month, to confront the full spectrum of AIDS, from patients like him with mild ailments right through to those in terminal stages -- his probable future, given it was still more than five years before the life-saving cocktail would be released.\n\nThe days leading up to his treatments were \"awful,\" Wendy recalls, \"because he'd be hell at work.

In the era when mass production was booming and many ready to wear men\u2019s fashion labels were coming up, Tommy Nutter single-handedly made a mark on men\u2019s couture.\n\nNutter\u2019s impact and influence on menswear was unique because he combined the skills of tailor and designer before Armani and Paul Smith created global empires\n\nIn 1969, at the age of 26, Tommy Nutter opened an unusual new boutique on the \u2018golden mile\u2019 of bespoke tailoring, the first new tailor in Savile Row in over a century. His store was called \u201c Nutters of Savile Row\u201d.\n\nA model wearing a Nutter Suit in New York, 1975. Right:\n\nNutter revolutionized the traditional savile row suit. Nutter created a thrilling new look, with a tighter waist and chest, incredible lapel widths on single-breasted jackets and a structure that was loose enough to dance in. There were wonderfully crazed juxtapositions of plaids and traditional tweeds and worsted cloths reinvented in bold, often clashing, colors, prints, and textures.\n\nThrough the 70s, Nutter even branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing his brand in Japan.\n\nNutter\u2019s life speaks volumes about the British fashion industry, how a designer and their name can be divorced as quickly as the price of a garment is cut for the end-of-season sales. With a slender grasp on the complexities of share ownership, Nutter was forced out of his first operation in 1976 by his business partner, Edward Sexton, and left virtually penniless while the company continued to trade under his name. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row successfully with a ready to wear shop: \u201cTommy Nutter, Savile Row.\n\nTommy Nutter had dressed all the popular actors singers and artists of his time. He dressed three of the four Beatles on the album cover of Abbey Road. He outfitted Mick Jagger \u2014 and then Jagger\u2019s wife. Elton John became one of his muses. Elton John turned to Tommy Nutter for more than 20 years when it came to his offstage getup \u2014 and occasionally his onstage getup, too: see the legendary black and white yin-yang ensemble he wore at Wembley Stadium in 1984.\n\nElton John in Nutter Suit 1975\n\nMick Jagger and Bianca Jagger in Tommy Nutter suits\n\n3 out 4 Beatles members wearing Tommy Nutter Suits\n\nNutter may have died at 49, but his legacy has proved enduring both on and off the Row. Tailor-designers like Timothy Everest, Oswald Boateng and Richard James are indebted to Nutter, and Tom Ford has acknowledged his stylistic influence. Recently, Tommy Hilfiger credited his \u201cirreverent approach\u201d as a source of inspiration, and in February this year, the American designer Todd Snyder debuted a collection at New York Fashion Week directly referencing Nutters of Savile Row.\n\nJ&J Crombie Limited, a British fashion company, today owns the \u201cTommy Nutter\u201d trademark. Crombie continues to produce tailoring and accessories based on the wealth of sketches and designs created by Tommy Nutter during his lifetime and now held in the Crombie archives."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/tommy-nutter/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter (17 April 1943 \u2013 17 August 1992) was a British tailor, famous for reinventing the Savile Row suit in the 1960s.\n\nBorn in Barmouth, Meirionnydd to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local High Street Cafe. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing, and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy.\n\nIn the early 1960s, he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton, to open Nutters of Savile Row at No 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White.\n\nThe business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of The Beatles' album Abbey Road in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims.\n\nIn the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976 Sexton bought Nutter out of the Business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row with a ready to wear shop: \"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\". (This new venture, which traded at No 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \"Tommy Nutter\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name.\n\nIn the 1980s, he described his suits as a \"cross between the big-shouldered Miami Vice look and the authentic Savile Row.\" He created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.\n\nNutter died in 1992 at the Cromwell Hospital in London of complications from AIDS. In 2018 House of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row a biography of Nutter, with reminiscences by his brother David, a New York celebrity photographer, was published; it was written by Lance Richardson."}, {"url": "https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/101601", "page_content": "Resources for Research\n\nThe Met's Libraries and Research Centers provide unparalleled resources for research and welcome an international community of students and scholars.\n\nThe Met Collection API is where all makers, creators, researchers, and dreamers can connect to the most up-to-date data and public domain images for The Met collection.
