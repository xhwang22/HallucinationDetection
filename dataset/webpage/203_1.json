Courtesy Everett Collection (2)\n\nOberon was born Estelle Merle O'Brien Thompson in 1911 in Mumbai (then Bombay), India, to a mother of mixed South Asian heritage and a White British father, according to The Washington Post. She later moved to Calcutta (now Kolkata) and, eventually, France and England, the latter by 17.\n\nShe began her career in British films, starting with bit parts before a bigger break as Anne Boleyn in 1933's The Private Life of Henry VIII.\n\nOberon would soon star as Lady Blakeney in The Scarlet Pimpernel and Kitty Vane in The Dark Angel. The latter role landed Oberon her Best Actress Oscar nomination. (She lost the award to Bette Davis.) She also starred as Cathy in 1939's Wuthering Heights.\n\nThe actress \u2014 who was married four times and had two children \u2014 had more than 50 screen credits to her name before retiring from acting following a final film role in the 1973 romantic drama Interval. Oberon died in 1979 at age 68, after suffering a stroke.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Oscars 2023 Nominations: Brendan Fraser, Austin Butler and Ana de Armas Among Nominees\n\nOberon's biracial heritage is not widely known because she herself hid it from the public during her life.\n\nAccording to the Post, which cites the podcast You Must Remember This, Oberon used white makeup and products to help bleach her skin, as well as a British accent, to try and obscure her origins. She also claimed she was born in the Australian state of Tasmania, per the Post.\n\nIn his 2008 book Merle Oberon: Face of Mystery, historian Bob Casey said in part, \"Merle Oberon set out as a charming, good-looking girl with a lovely smile who made the most of her looks and her luck,\" according to Australian outlet the Herald Sun.\n\n\"But she kept painting herself into a corner with these lies about being born in Tasmania, which I believe she paid a heavy price for,\" he added.\n\nMerle Oberon.

If she can do it, I can freaking well do it as well.' That is the most important thing.\"\n\n\"I'm very ordinary. I just work very hard,\" she added. \"There are so many brilliant actresses, actors out there who know that they have a seat at the table. All they have to do is find an opportunity and get there.\"\n\nThe Malaysian-born actress \u2014 who is considered a Best Actress frontrunner at the upcoming Academy Awards for her performance as Evelyn Wang in Everything Everywhere All at Once \u2014 told TIME last month that she has \"thought about\" the fact that no Asian woman has ever won Best Actress at the Oscars, adding, \"And not just me \u2014 I feel like my full Asian community has thought about it.\"\n\n\"They come up to me and they say, 'You're doing it for us,' \" Yeoh told TIME.\n\nThe 95th Academy Awards will air live on ABC March 12."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/mar/06/merle-oberon-oscars-best-actress", "page_content": "Magazine writers didn\u2019t know what to make of Merle Oberon when she took Hollywood by storm in the 1930s. One writer described her as \u201cbizarre, bewildering, and different\u201d, while others marveled at her \u201cdelicate\u201d oval face, \u201celoquent\u201d emerald eyes, \u201cbright red lips\u201d and \u201calabaster\u201d skin.\n\nThough her 1936 best actress Oscar nomination for the coming-of-age drama The Dark Angel affirmed her place in a league with Katharine Hepburn and the eventual winner, Bette Davis, the glamor paragons of the day, it was only later that the world discovered Oberon was a south Asian woman passing for white.\n\nGiven the way Everything Everywhere All at Once has dominated this awards season, it seems increasingly likely that Michelle Yeoh will take home this year\u2019s best actress prize. But when Yeoh\u2019s name was announced among the best actress nominees for this year\u2019s Academy Awards in late January, the Hollywood Reporter was at pains to call the veteran actor \u201cthe first person who identifies as Asian to ever be nominated for the award\u201d.\n\nLaurence Olivier and Merle Oberon in Wuthering Heights. Photograph: United Artists/Allstar\n\nCritics condemned the declaration as too politically correct, even as it captured the complex tie that binds these women, each a product of her time. Where the 60-year-old Yeoh is a butt-kicking film pioneer on the brink of smashing a cultural ceiling for playing a role originally written for Jackie Chan, Oberon carefully hid her true identity to evade certain racial persecution and took that secret to her grave. It wasn\u2019t until decades after her death in 1979 at age 68 that the world learned her truth. That, not Oberon\u2019s eye-opening work in The Dark Angel, is what should rightly be hailed as her signature performance.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about the story of racial representation,\u201d says Shilpa Dav\u00e9, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, \u201cMerle Oberon is a really important part. She brings a global aspect to it, the shades of brown.\u201d\n\nBorn Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in what was then the British Indian city of Bombay, Oberon was determined to make the most of her innately fairer complexion. It became her ticket to a bigger world, the shroud that helped disguise the fact that she was the product of rape. Her birth father was the Anglo-Irish foreman of a tea plantation. Her mother, believed to have been of Sri Lankan and M\u0101ori ancestry, was just 14 when she gave birth in 1911. After centuries of intermixing, babies born from biracial relationships had evolved into a quiet shame \u2013 shunned by Britons and Indians alike.\n\nThe family nicknamed Oberon \u201cQueenie\u201d, as her birth coincided with Queen Mary and King George\u2019s visit to India. In an attempt to soften Oberon\u2019s lot in life, her grandmother raised her as her own and convinced her that her teenage mother was actually her half sister. But that wasn\u2019t enough to shield Oberon from the relentless taunts over her mixed heritage. At the age of three, after a cross-country move to Calcutta, she won a scholarship to one of the city\u2019s best all-girls private schools, only for classmates to drive her out with their overt racism. Films and the nightlife scene became her escape, and playing pretend key to her survival.\n\nMerle Oberon and Leslie Howard in The Scarlet Pimpernel. Photograph: Allstar Picture Library Ltd/Alamy\n\nIn adolescence, Oberon began honing a posh accent and lightening her skin with bleach creams loaded with ammoniated mercury \u2013 a dangerous poison that had more of a weakening effect on Oberon\u2019s many male suitors. Those who didn\u2019t dump her outright after discovering her race helped sponsor her moves from India to France and England, where she worked for a time as a club hostess under the name Queenie O\u2019Brien. When she became romantically involved with the Hungarian-born British director Alexander Korda, Oberon\u2019s acting career clicked into high gear.\n\nA bit part as Anne Boleyn in the 1933 blockbuster The Private Life of Henry VIII announced her breakout. A mad scramble to come up with a cover story for the actor credited as \u201cMerle Oberon\u201d ensued. She told people she had been born in Tasmania \u201cbecause it was so far from the US and Europe and generally considered to be \u2018British\u2019 to its core\u201d, wrote Mar\u00e9e Delofski, director of the 2002 documentary The Trouble with Merle. (In her lifetime, Oberon visited Australia twice.) Oberon claimed her birth records had been destroyed in a fire. (Her half-brother, Harry, would discover them in Bombay, now Mumbai, after her death.) As for her much darker-skinned mother \u2013 her biological grandmother \u2013 Oberon presented her as a maid.\n\nSuch was the cost of making it in show business at a time when the US government was keen to crack down on indecency. Rather than leave it up to lawmakers, Hollywood seized on the opportunity to police itself, adopting a set of rules known as the Hays Code \u2013 which, among many other things, frowned upon interracial romance. With representational casting essentially made illegal, studios embraced yellow and blackface. And when Oberon\u2019s early work with Korda, whom she eventually married, led to a successful career under Samuel Goldwyn, it became in everyone\u2019s best interest to keep her identity a mystery. \u201cThink about it,\u201d says Dav\u00e9. \u201cShe was part of this cadre of actors and actresses that were loaned out to make all these movies. She was dependent on Goldwyn and Korda for her livelihood. I can see why she had to hide in that way. She had no power.\u201d\n\nNot even the 1936 best actress nomination brought Oberon any extra clout. For a start, the Oscars were barely a decade old and not yet the gold standard award. For another, the media was even tougher on female actors than they are now and held Oberon up for extra scrutiny.\n\nOberon gets a tip as she leaves for Royal Ascot, in a 1950 photo in London. Photograph: Norman Vigars/Getty Images\n\nOne critic derided Oberon\u2019s performance in the 1934 action film The Scarlet Pimpernel, citing a \u201ctendency to strongly orientalize her appearance by means of facial makeup and the slant of black brows\u201d. When a 1934 Los Angeles Times story used the term \u201cEuro-Asian\u201d to describe her, Oberon dismissed it as a coincidence. In an ad campaign for Max Factor, the cosmetics brand bragged about how its makeup turned her from \u201cslightly unreal and exotic\u201d to a \u201cbeautiful, charming girl\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that she would be Oscar nominated for The Dark Angel, a film about a first world war love affair that is complicated when the male protagonist suffers a battle injury that costs him his eyesight. Strangely, it was Oberon\u2019s only nomination, even as Hepburn and Davis became Oscar perennials and Oberon kept working into the early 70s. She starred opposite Laurence Olivier in 1939\u2019s Wuthering Heights and as herself in 1966\u2019s The Oscar, which is about the awards.\n\nStill, she soldiered on in spite of the damage she\u2019d caused to her skin from so much bleach cream and a car accident that left her disfigured and forced Korda to abandon production of the epic I, Claudius. To keep the cracks in Oberon\u2019s white facade from surfacing on screen, the cinematographer Lucien Ballard developed a special camera light for her to obscure her facial scars. This was after \u201cLady Korda\u201d had divorced her knighted director husband to marry Ballard.\n\nOn her downslope, Oberon reveled in her grand dame status, regaling magazine reporters with her true Hollywood stories, when she wasn\u2019t making the odd cameo on the game show What\u2019s My Line? or presenting a special achievement award to the Poseidon Adventure at the 1973 Oscars. Even then Charlton Heston called her \u201ca lady whose beauty is not only a legend, but a reality\u201d.\n\nBut even as times changed and Hollywood\u2019s aversion toward race mixing on screen began to relax, Oberon remained committed to her lie and quickly tightened up when it unraveled. When her nephew Michael Korda, then editor-in-chief at Simon and Schuster, tried to write a biography on Oberon, he says, she threatened to sue him and cut him out of her will if he used real details. So he turned it into the roman-\u00e0-clef Queenie, which became an ABC miniseries.\n\nAccording to the Australian historian Cassandra Pybus, a visit to Hobart in 1978 turned awkward for Oberon when officials couldn\u2019t find proof that she had been born in Tasmania. After confirming as much, Oberon ducked reporters and skipped a ceremony at a theater named in her honor before quietly returning home.\n\nA year later, she died in Malibu from a stroke."}, {"url": "https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/who-was-first-woman-color-bring-anne-boleyns-story-screen-180977882/", "page_content": "When British broadcaster Channel 5 announced the cast of its \u201cAnne Boleyn\u201d miniseries last October, the show\u2019s eponymous star\u2014Black actress Jodie Turner-Smith\u2014faced immediate backlash from critics who objected to a woman of color portraying the white Tudor queen.\n\nThe racist overtones of this outcry weren\u2019t lost on Turner-Smith, who tells Glamour\u2019s Abigail Blackburn that she knew \u201cit would be something that people felt very passionately about, either in a positive or a negative way, because Anne is a human in history who people feel very strongly about.\u201d As the actress adds, she responded to the criticism by focusing on the story she and the series\u2019 creators wanted to tell\u2014a \u201chuman story\u201d of Anne as a mother.\n\nThe three-part production, which premiered earlier this week, revisits the final days of Anne\u2019s life from her own perspective, framing the intrigues of Tudor court as a psychological thriller rather than a historically accurate period drama. In addition to Turner-Smith, the show features Black actors Paapa Essiedu as Anne\u2019s brother and Thalissa Teixeira as the queen\u2019s cousin.\n\nInstead of practicing color-blind casting, the show\u2019s creators adopted an \u201cidentity-conscious\u201d approach to choosing its stars, reports Flora Carr for RadioTimes.com. Mark Stanley, a white actor who portrays Anne\u2019s husband, the mercurial Henry VIII, tells RadioTimes.com that \u201c[i]t was all about this being the right person for the job, rather than what we as a society might perceive as the \u2018right look\u2019 for the job. Anne Boleyn was beautiful, witty, vibrant, intelligent and Jodie is all of those things.\u201d\n\nTurner-Smith\u2019s casting is part of a broader trend within the cultural sphere. Instances of Hollywood whitewashing real-life historical figures abound, from John Wayne as Genghis Khan in The Conqueror (1956) to Elizabeth Taylor as the title character in Cleopatra (1963). Though some creators have taken steps to combat whitewashing, either through color-blind casting or the intentional casting of non-white actors (Broadway blockbuster Hamilton and Netflix drama \u201cBridgerton\u201d stand out as recent examples), the furor over \u201cAnne Boleyn\u201d underscores the polarizing nature of this approach.\n\nThe real Anne Boleyn wasn\u2019t Black. But as Anita Singh argues in the Telegraph\u2019s review of the miniseries, other adaptations of the Tudor period have taken comparable liberties without attracting the level of ire directed at Turner-Smith. Showtime\u2019s \u201cThe Tudors,\u201d for instance, transformed a 30-something Jonathan Rhys Meyers into the aging, increasingly obese Henry VIII by simply giving him a graying beard and a raspy voice. Singh further points out that Turner-Smith\u2019s casting doubles as \u201ca clever way of illustrating Anne\u2019s outsider status at court in the final months of her life.\u201d\n\nDecades before \u201cAnne Boleyn\u201d debuted, another British starlet made history as the first non-white actress to play a British royal onscreen: Merle Oberon, who hid her Asian heritage to protect her career at a time of rampant racism. Though the young actress appeared in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933) for just a few minutes, her performance was \u201cquietly riveting,\u201d writes Ed Power for the Telegraph. The film\u2019s success, and her subsequent casting in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), inspired Oberon to relocate to the United States. She received an Academy Award nomination for her starring turn in The Dark Angel (1935) but is perhaps best known for playing the Cathy to Laurence Olivier\u2019s Heathcliff in the 1939 adaptation of Wuthering Heights.\n\nSupposedly born in Tasmania to a British Army officer who died when she was young, Oberon claimed to have been raised by her aristocratic Indian godparents. But as Lisa Liebman reported for Vanity Fair in 2017, this account was likely a fake origin story invented by the actress\u2019 first husband, Henry VIII director Alexander Korda. (The couple wed in 1939, six years after the film\u2019s premiere.)\n\nIn truth, Oberon was born Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in 1911. She grew up in poverty in Mumbai, which was then under British control. Her mother, Constance Selby, was of Sri Lankan and M\u0101ori descent, while her father, Arthur Thompson, was a British railway engineer.\n\nOberon \u201cwas the product of rape two generations over,\u201d noted journalist Halley Bondy in a 2020 episode of the \u201cYou Must Remember This\u201d podcast. Her grandmother, 26-year-old Charlotte Selby, was in a relationship with Thompson when he impregnated Constance, who gave birth to Oberon at just 12 years old. More than a decade earlier, Charlotte herself was raped by an Irish foreman of a tea plantation in Sri Lanka and gave birth to Constance at age 14.\n\nCharlotte raised Oberon as her own daughter, and the young girl grew up believing that Constance was her sister. Years later, when one of Constance\u2019s sons learned the truth about Oberon\u2019s parentage, he attempted to arrange a meeting with her but found his request refused, per Claire Ellicott of the Sunday Tasmanian. Thompson, for his part, fought for the British Army during World War I and died of pneumonia at the Battle of the Somme.\n\nOberon, who had significantly lighter skin than her grandmother, began wearing white makeup to mask her true complexion during her teenage years. Following her discovery by Korda at age 17, she took additional steps to alter her appearance, including lightening her hair and using skin bleaching products laced with toxic mercury. According to Kevin O\u2019Keeffe of Mic, Oberon reportedly refused to appear on camera without wearing makeup\u2014a choice explained, in retrospect, by her desire to present herself as white.\n\nBondy argued that Oberon\u2019s tragic family history, as well as her upbringing in a deeply racist society, may have left her with \u201cuntreated, inherited trauma, [which] can give someone the uncanny ability to be so disassociated from their true identity that [they] think they can slip undetected between false identities in order to seem to be whatever people want them to be.\u201d Oberon certainly never admitted to her past: In 1978, the year before her death at age 68, she accepted an invitation to Tasmania to see her \u201cbirthplace\u201d but spent most of the trip hiding in her room, \u201cterrified from the moment she got [there that] her story would unravel,\u201d per biographer Bob Casey.\n\nThe first inklings of Oberon\u2019s true heritage came to light in 1983, when two biographers \u201cintrigued by [her] evasiveness\u201d raised questions about her early years, as the Washington Post\u2019s Christopher Schemering wrote in 1985. Two years later, Oberon\u2019s nephew, Michael Korda, published a novel loosely\u2014but transparently\u2014based on his aunt\u2019s secret life. The full truth of the matter was only revealed in 2014, when a joint initiative between the British Library and ancestry website findmypast.co.uk published Oberon\u2019s birth certificate, which identified Constance, not Charlotte, as her mother.\n\nOberon was the first woman of color to play Anne Boleyn. Turner-Smith won\u2019t be the last. As soon as this September, Filipino Canadian actress Andrea Macasaet is set to step into the role for the Broadway production of Six, a pop musical based on the lives of the Tudor king\u2019s six wives.\n\n\u201cWe have these iconic figures from history and literature, who people feel possessive about in some way,\u201d says scholar Miranda Kaufman, author of Black Tudors: The Untold Story, to History Extra\u2019s Rachel Dinning. \u201cBut you have to remember that it\u2019s not a historical reconstruction: it\u2019s a thriller; it\u2019s a drama; it\u2019s entertainment.

It\u2019s believed Korda, who became the first of Oberon\u2019s four husbands, concocted the fake origin story.\n\nNicknamed \u201cQueenie\u201d in honor of King George V and Queen Mary\u2019s 1911 visit to India the year she was born in the city now known as Mumbai, Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson\u2019s true provenance wasn\u2019t revealed until four years after her death in 1979. The biography Merle: A Biography of Merle Oberon exposed what seems to have been known by those in her inner circle: Oberon was Anglo-Indian. Her mother\u2014or the woman believed to be her mother (more about that later)\u2014came from what\u2019s now Sri Lanka, and was part M\u0101ori; her father, Arthur Thompson, was a British mechanical engineer. Ironically, the regal actress\u2014she became \u201cLady Korda\u201d when her first husband was knighted in 1942\u2014had an impoverished childhood in India.\n\nIn 1985, her nephew Michael Korda, then editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, penned the roman \u00e0 clef Queenie about his aunt, and told The Los Angeles Times that her Eurasian ancestry \u201cwas an open secret\u201d within his family. He also said that when he wrote a 1979 family memoir, Oberon threatened to sue him for including her real name and birthplace, so he had to obscure them.\n\nIn The Last Tycoon, which premieres July 28, Beals\u2019s Margo negotiates her own deals and rides roughshod over directors, demanding they show her their genitals before she\u2019ll shoot a frame of film. She also has a secret: she\u2019s passing for white\u2014with her black mother by her side, masquerading as her maid\u2014much as Oberon\u2019s mother, Charlotte Selby, did when the actress lived in England.\n\nWhile Beals knew Margo was based on Oberon, she says her goal for her character, who wears \u201clayers of masks,\u201d was to make her distinct. Yet her interpretation of the fiercely independent actress may also offer insight into Oberon\u2019s own mindset. \u201cMargo is willing to suppress so much in order to get as far as she can,\u201d says Beals. Oberon was just as tenacious: after a 1937 car accident damaged one side of her face, she hid her scars with makeup and good lighting. Then, on the set of the 1944 filmThe Lodger, cinematographer Lucien Ballard mounted a light on the side of a camera, which diffused her flaws. The \u201cObie,\u201d as the device became known, went into wide use\u2014and Oberon left Korda to marry Ballard in 1945."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/Merle-Oberon/6000000008452636654", "page_content": "About Merle Oberon\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle_Oberon\n\nMerle Oberon (19 February 1911 \u2013 23 November 1979) was an Anglo-Indian actress. She began her film career in British films as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933). After her success in The Scarlet Pimpernel (1934), she travelled to the United States to make films for Samuel Goldwyn. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in The Dark Angel (1935). A traffic collision in 1937 caused facial injuries that could have ended her career, but she soon followed this with her most renowned performance in Wuthering Heights (1939). Throughout her adult life, in order to conceal her Indian heritage she maintained the fiction that she was born in Tasmania, Australia; the year before she died she finally admitted this story was not true, and records located since her death have confirmed her true origin.\n\nFamily\n\nFather: unknown\n\nMother: Constance Thompson (daughter of Charlotte and Henry Alfred Selby)\n\nMarried: 1) Alexander Korda 2) Lucien Ballard 3) Bruno Pagliai 4) Robert Wolders\n\nChildren: 2 adopted with Bruno Pagliari\n\nFilmography\n\nActress (60 credits)\n\n1973 Interval Serena Moore\n\n1967 Hotel The Duchess Caroline\n\n1966 The Oscar Merle Oberon\n\n1963 Of Love and Desire Katherine Beckmann\n\n1957 General Electric Theater (TV Series) Mata Hari - I Will Not Die (1957) ...

A thirteen-year Boleyn gap followed. Then, in 1933, Anne Boleyn broke into talking pictures. An actress named Merle Oberon rocked the B necklace, and the movie world, when she appeared as Anne in Alexander Korda\u2019s Oscar-winning Private Life of Henry VIII.\n\nMerle Oberon, one of the glamour goddesses of the movies\u2019 golden era, actually had quite a lot in common with Anne Boleyn, the woman she portrayed so memorably in only a few minutes of screen time.\n\nGirls who would be queen\n\n\n\nAnne Boleyn, of course, famously held out on Henry VIII until she was sure he would put a queen\u2019s crown on her head. Merle also reckoned herself a queen, if somewhat more prosaically. Born Estelle Merle O\u2019Brien Thompson in 1911, she was known as \u2018Queenie\u2019 O\u2019Brien during her childhood and during her early adult years, when she was variously a night club hostess, a wealthy man\u2019s companion, and a bit part actress.\n\nDark Angels\n\nMerle Oberon is probably most famous for her role as Kathy in Wuthering Heights. The Dark Angel, a World War I drama, was the 1935 film for which Oberon won her only Oscar nomination.\n\nThe words \u2018dark angel\u2019 described Merle\u2019s exotic brunette looks perfectly. The woman was, in fact, Eurasian, something which, in a time of less enlightened sensibilities than we have now, would have put paid to her film career, were it known. Merle spent a lifetime hiding the fact that she was born into a family of part-Eurasian, part-Maori blood in Bombay, India.\n\nAnne Boleyn was also a dark angel, with brunette good looks that, while irresistible to Henry VIII, were not typical of the English Rose appearance that was the prototype of beauty at the Tudor court. Anne\u2019s French ways, a product of a youth spent at the French court, only added to her exotic quality.\n\nDysfunction junction\n\nIt can\u2019t have been easy for Anne Boleyn to live down being the sister of Mary Boleyn, who one person stated was known as \u2018a great whore, infamous above all\u2019, for her antics at the French court with the French King, and who became Henry VIII\u2019s mistress; some even attribute her marital Carey children to the English King. There was even a rumour about the English court that Anne Boleyn\u2019s mother, Elizabeth, had also been Henry\u2019s mistress.*\n\nMerle Oberon likewise had a lot of family dysfunction to live down. Although raised by a woman named Charlotte Selby, Merle was actually the child of Charlotte\u2019s twelve year old daughter, Constance, and Charlotte\u2019s man of the moment, one Arthur Thompson. Merle always obfuscated about her origins, which would, in the first half of the twentieth century, have done considerable damage to her social standing and her career.\n\nLife and Death\n\nWhen she was twenty-six or so years old, Anne Boleyn suffered from the sweating sickness, a plague prevalent in Tudor England and often deadly. Anne happily survived its depredations.\n\nAt around the same age, Merle Oberon was involved in a very serious auto accident. She, too, survived her misfortune, but sustained significant facial scars.\n\nBeauty is imperfection\n\nMarilyn Monroe is said to have made the above statement, but it is likely that Merle Oberon and Anne Boleyn would not have agreed. Both beauties were said to have imperfections that they went to great lengths to hide.\n\nA late 16th century writer described Anne has having a sixth finger on one of her hands and a swelling on her neck. Although this description is taken with a huge pinch of salt by modern historians, a contemporary did describe her as \u201cNot one of the handsomest women in the world\u201d.\n\nMerle Oberon, as has already been mentioned, had a car accident in 1937 that caused considerable facial injury and scarring. She may also have had an allergic reaction to makeup that caused further skin damage years later. As a result of these unfortunate occurrences, Merle had to be very carefully and heavily made up, and very carefully lit, when filmed. In the movies\u2019 early days, cinematographers worked in black and white, and were experts in using light and shadow. They were able to effectively hide any of Merle\u2019s imperfections; she always appeared the ideal, dewy-eyed beauty on screen. Oberon\u2019s second husband, cinematographer Lucien Ballard, invented a light to use specifically to light Oberon\u2019s face. It has gone down in history as the Obie light, and it highlighted and emphasized Oberon\u2019s glowing eyes.\n\n\n\nCatching the eye of The Big Man\n\nWe all know which Big Man Anne Boleyn had the fortune, or misfortune, to captivate: Henry VIII, the man who ruled England.\n\nIn the 1930s, the man who ruled Merle Oberon\u2019s world of British cinema was mega-producer Alexander Korda. He is said to have noticed the enchanting Merle while she was standing in a movie studio tea line; he cast her as Anne Boleyn in The Private Life of Henry VIII, and eventually married her. The two were wed from 1939-1945; he was the first of Merle\u2019s four husbands.\n\n\n\n\n\nSomebody always loves a little more\n\nHenry VIII\u2019s infatuation with Anne Boleyn and the passionate love letters he sent to her, make it easy to theorize that of the two of them, Henry was the one who loved more, if not most. The same was apparently true in the Korda-Oberon union. Korda\u2019s nephew, Michael, has been quoted as saying \u201cAlex had a deep, deep passion for Merle, but she didn\u2019t return it, although she had considerable affection for him.\u201d\n\nThe King\u2019s Great Matter\n\nHenry VIII\u2019s Great Matter was his divorce from Katharine of Aragon, preparatory to marrying Anne Boleyn. Although he eventually achieved his end, Henry\u2019s Great Matter proved disastrous to his reputation and to the lives of many who were involved in it, including Anne Boleyn, Thomas Wolsey, and Thomas More.\n\nAlexander Korda\u2019s Great Matter, in 1937, was a planned filming of Robert Graves\u2019 epic I Claudius. It has gone down in history as one of the greatest films never made; like Henry\u2019s undertaking, Korda\u2019s I Claudius was also plagued by disaster, and the production was eventually shelved. Involved in the project were movie greats Joseph Von Sternberg, Charles Laughton, Flora Robson, Emlyn Williams, and, of course, Merle Oberon. Legend has it that it was Oberon\u2019s serious car accident in 1937 that was the final nail in the film\u2019s coffin; Oberon was to have starred in the film as the scheming and licentious Messalina, but her accident precluded this. In yet another Oberon-Boleyn coincidence, Alison Weir notes that Eustace Chapuys, the Spanish Ambassador to Henry VIII\u2019s court, was known to refer to Anne Boleyn as \u2018The English Messalina\u2019.\n\n\n\nFusion\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see Merle Oberon as Anne Boleyn, check out The Private Life of Henry VIII.

Life stepped in, and she wound up with a Master\u2019s Degree in Nursing instead. A twenty-five year nursing career didn\u2019t extinguish that early interest in books and history-especially Tudor history. It did, however, stoke a decidedly gallows sense of humor.\n\nEventually, JoAnn read just about every spin there was on the stories of Henry VIII and the extended Tudor family. Every spin, that is, except the one with the gallows humor. The Tudors certainly qualified for it, but it just wasn\u2019t out there. JoAnn decided that with gallows humor to spare, she would do her best to remedy the Tudor comedy gap. A little inspiration from the classic \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d showed her the way to go, and \u201cSix of One\u201d, a new kind of Tudor novel, was born. JoAnn thought \u201cSix of One\u201d, her story about Henry VIII\u2019s six wives, would be an only literary child. Then, two years after its birth, she was caught by surprise with the idea for a sequel. In October, 2015, \u201cSeven Will Out\u201d made its debut and bought the latter-day Tudors into the comedy mix.\n\nClick here to read my reviews of JoAnn\u2019s novels, which are both rip-roaring reads.\n\n\n\nNotes and Sources\n\nCategories: Representations of Anne Boleyn, Books, Spoofs\n\n"}]}
