King said, \u201cThat\u2019s just him.\u201d\n\nThey talk about his easygoing personality and how he allows the players their freedom. Calvin de Haan said recently, \u201cKinger\u2019s come in, said the right things, I believe, and he\u2019s got a real down-to-earth mentality and personality. He\u2019s been fun to talk to and fun to be around in the locker room. I think he\u2019s kind of letting us steer the ship to a certain extent.\u201d\n\nThey mention his unselfishness and say how good of a person he is. Dallas Eakins, who played and coached with King, said, \u201cBack when we\u2019re playing, like one of the call-up guys wouldn\u2019t have a car here. \u2026 He\u2019s like, can I give you a ride? It\u2019s who he is, and I just can\u2019t say enough about him. \u2026 Like 10 out of 10, this is a guy you\u2019d want as your friend. You\u2019d want him as your father. You\u2019d want him as your son-in-law.\u201d\n\nThey describe how he\u2019s content wherever he is, which allows him to do the job at hand and is why he seemed to be the ideal candidate for interim head coach. Rockford IceHogs president of hockey operations and general manager Mark Bernard said, \u201cIf I asked him his five-year plan, it was going to be, \u2018Well, to be in Rockford five years. I just want to come in and I want to help the future players in the Blackhawks.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have an agenda where, \u2018Well, I\u2019d like to be in Rockford for two years and then I want to move up to the NHL as assistant and then I want to move up as a head coach.\u2019 He was quite adamant that he could be in Rockford for the rest of his career and to develop players and be happy with that.\u201d\n\nWhat about when he isn\u2019t happy?\n\nAnders Sorensen, IceHogs interim head coach and King\u2019s former assistant, provided some intel on a seldom-seen but very effective King facial expression that seems to get his players\u2019 attention.\n\n\u201cI joke around, I like when he gets his angry Scottish face on,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cHe can really stare a guy down with the best of them. His eyes go all black and he gives you the death stare. I\u2019ve seen it a few times. I think guys definitely respect that. It\u2019s not a daily thing at all, so you know when he does it, he means it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether the 54-year-old King will be the long-term choice for the Blackhawks as head coach is unknown. Interim general manager Kyle Davidson has already stated the search for a permanent head coach won\u2019t begin until the offseason. The search could begin and end with King. He\u2019ll have at least a 70-NHL game sample size to analyze at that point.\n\nBut for now, he is the Blackhawks head coach, and for many who have played and coached with and for him, he\u2019s the perfect person for the Blackhawks at this moment.\n\n\u201cWhen times are tough up top there, those guys feel the pressure,\u201d said Cody Franson, who played for King when King was an IceHogs assistant and head coach. \u201cSometimes when you get a new coach, it can provide that spark on its own. But I think what Kinger\u2019s going to bring to those guys is a guy who played, a guy who understands it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go in there and try and change everything overnight. But I think Kinger\u2019s going to be a guy that naturally guys want to play for and try and have success for.\n\n\u201cI went through coaching changes midseason in Toronto, so I\u2019ve been through it, too. There\u2019s different elements that come into play. But Kinger\u2019s one of those personalities that guys gravitate to. He\u2019s the kind of guy who wants to make you run through a wall for because he shows you respect when you deserve it and he manages a group really well and gets a good feel of his guys and tries to do everything he can to help guys win. He\u2019s very much a guy that\u2019s trying to work with the guys and doesn\u2019t want his room divided and that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nDerek King began considering coaching at the end of his own long and successful playing career.\n\nKing produced 612 points in 830 career NHL games. There was a three-season stretch with the New York Islanders in the early 1990s where he scored 108 goals. He wrapped up his NHL playing days with the 1999-2000 season and kept playing elsewhere for a few seasons. He went to Germany and then returned to North America to play for the Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Griffins attracted him with an interesting proposal \u2014 be a player and a coach for them.\n\n\u201cHe was always a guy who had a good head for the game,\u201d said Danton Cole, who was the head coach of the Griffins at the time and is now Michigan State\u2019s men\u2019s head coach. \u201cWe talked to him about a lot of stuff anyhow, so it was a good kind of progression there. It was something that made our spot interesting for him. He was still playing, and I\u2019ve had player-assistants before; you try to involve them in certain parts and give them a flavor of what coaching is like. It\u2019s a lot different than what we think of as a player.\u201d\n\nKing mainly assisted on special teams and provided insight into what he was seeing on the ice. He remained player-assistant for two seasons, but there wasn\u2019t a full-time coaching position available after that.\n\nAfter the 2003-04 season, he permanently moved to Arizona, where he owned some real estate properties. He coached his eldest son, D.J., occasionally helped out at some pro camps and golfed. He and his wife later had twin sons while living in Arizona.\n\n\u201cAnd then my twins came and my golf game went pfft,\u201d King said.\n\nThat was his life and might have remained his life until Dallas Eakins called one day. They had played and roomed together while with the Toronto Maple Leafs and became good friends. When Eakins was hired as Toronto Marlies head coach in 2009, he first sought an assistant with coaching experience and hired Gord Dineen. There were fewer parameters with the second assistant position, and he thought of his old friend.\n\n\u201cDerek King was coaching kids in Scottsdale, like helping kids out, and I just thought he would be an unbelievable coach, even though he had no pro experience, because he had played for so long, he had played for Al Arbour, he had played for Pat Quinn, and I think when you play for great coaches whether you\u2019re cognizant of it or not, you\u2019re learning great lessons from them,\u201d said Eakins, who is now the head coach of the Anaheim Ducks. \u201cAnd then just the way Kinger\u2019s personality was, I just thought he was really going to see the game through the players\u2019 eyes, and I really believe that\u2019s a massive part of the coaching process. And so that\u2019s kind of where it started.\u201d\n\nDerek King was a first-round draft pick by the New York Islanders in 1985. (Getty Images)\n\nKing wasn\u2019t really aware of the impact Arbour and Quinn, who are third and sixth in NHL coaching victories, had on him at the time, but he does recognize it now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI played in a time where the video and the iPads on the bench, there was none of that,\u201d King said. \u201cCoaches coached with feel. They had a feel for the game and they just knew how to manage players, so I had some great coaches that did that. Al Arbour was huge. \u2026 Because he used to ride me, but then when you retire and you start coaching kids, you understand why he was riding me: to make me a better player, better person, so I take stuff from him. Pat Quinn was another guy like that. He just had a way with things. He knew how to push buttons, he knew who to hug, who to kick in the butt, and he was excellent at it. I go to Toronto and I\u2019m getting kicked in the butt and yelled at, and I\u2019m wondering why, but I figured it out: I drove these coaches nuts. Now it\u2019s time for guys to drive me nuts.\u201d\n\nRay Ferraro witnessed Arbour driving King nuts. Ferraro played with King under Arbour while with the Islanders.\n\n\u201cHe was hard on Kinger because he knew Kinger had lots more,\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cHe knew Kinger had more than Kinger thought he had. And so, Kinger got 40 goals for Al. \u2026 Kinger could score, and Al kept pushing him for more because he knew he had it.\u201d\n\nWith Eakins\u2019 Marlies coaching offer, King jumped at the chance. Eakins gave him a lot of responsibility early on and put him in charge of the forwards. King had some things to learn, but he had a lot of coaching instincts already.\n\nKing was Eakins\u2019 assistant for four years with the Marlies. Eakins moved on and King stayed. He was then an assistant under Steve Spott during 2013-14 season and then an associate coach for Dineen for a season.\n\nAfter the 2014-15 season, King was let go by the Maple Leafs while the organization went through staff changes. King took an assistant position with the Owen Sound Attack of the OHL the following season, but he found the team was too far from his home in the Toronto area and only coached there for one season.\n\nMark Bernard and Derek King both grew up in Hamilton, Ontario. King was nearly two years older than Bernard, but they hung out within the same group of hockey players and skated together a lot of summers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBernard and King had kept in touch a bit over the years, so it wasn\u2019t completely out of the blue when King rang Bernard after the 2015-16 season and asked if the Blackhawks were looking for any coaches. King had just left his OHL position.\n\nIt just happened the Blackhawks were searching for a new assistant for the IceHogs. The problem is they had already interviewed a number of people and Stan Bowman, then the Blackhawks general manager, was close to a final decision.\n\n\u201cIn Stan\u2019s mind, he really liked one of the applicants,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cAnd I kind of begged, kind of said, \u2018No, let\u2019s just interview him in Buffalo. We\u2019re going to the draft and he can drive up from Hamilton. Trust me, you\u2019ll love this guy as an applicant.\u2019 Stan held off and we interviewed him before the draft in Buffalo, and it worked out and Stan loved him and he got the job and off we went.\u201d\n\nKing was an assistant under Ted Dent his first season with the IceHogs. It was a trying season for the team, and Dent was fired after it. King was retained and became an assistant for Jeremy Colliton.\n\nUnder Colliton, King had more of a vocal role at times.\n\n\u201cWhen (King) was the assistant coach, Jeremy wasn\u2019t much of a scream and yell guy,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who played for the IceHogs from 2017-2020. \u201cWhen we needed that, that would be Kinger\u2019s kind of job to step in, make sure everybody\u2019s on their toes. If he wasn\u2019t happy with how things were going, he was going to let you know about it.\u201d\n\nDerek King became the Rockford IceHogs coach early into the 2018-19 season. (Nathan Vestal/IceHogs)\n\nThe IceHogs reached the playoffs that season. Colliton and King returned together for the 2018-19 season. When the Blackhawks fired Joel Quenneville early into the season, Colliton was promoted to head coach of the Blackhawks, and King was made the IceHogs\u2019 interim head coach. King was given the job permanently after the season.\n\nWhile King did know how to push his players\u2019 buttons like his former coaches, he knows where the balance is at and often leans towards keeping the atmosphere light.\n\n\u201cHe knows when it\u2019s time to be serious with them, but at the same time, he puts them at ease where he can talk to them and be one of the guys,\u201d Bernard said. \u201cWhen he was the assistant coach here, he\u2019d go out and play (two)-touch soccer with them before the game. And we used to always laugh because he\u2019d go out to play and come right back. We\u2019d be like, \u2018I thought you\u2019re to play soccer.\u2019 \u2018Yeah, they got me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen Jeremy got called up to Chicago and Derek took over here, that was my main point of advice for him \u2014 just be yourself, the guys love you. They play hard for you. Just continue to be yourself because that\u2019s what the players love, and he did that, to his credit. The players here in Rockford, I know, all enjoyed playing for him.\u201d\n\nDylan Sikura, another one of King\u2019s former players, did enjoy playing for him, but he also recalled him not leaving the soccer games so graciously.\n\n\u201cDefinitely a players coach,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cKept it very loose around the locker room but demanded a lot from his guys. Was always cracking jokes always, keeping it light. You could tell he got a real joy being around the guys like when he used to play. He would play sewer ball (also known as two-touch soccer) with our team and refuse to get out. I remember one time we were down in a (hockey) game going into the third not playing well at all. In between periods, he said that we\u2019re going back to minor hockey, which meant when you get off the ice you enter in one (bench) door and exit in the other. No lines, no pairs. Whenever you get off, that\u2019s who you would go with. I remember playing some shifts with five forwards or sometimes D playing forward. We ended up coming back and winning.\u201d\n\nCody Franson had come to the decision he wasn\u2019t going to return to the KHL last season and would pursue a team to play for in North America again. He looked at his options and thought immediately about the IceHogs.\n\nFranson had already been through one stint with the IceHogs while under contract with the Blackhawks during the 2017-18 season. Back then, King was an assistant for the IceHogs. With King as the head coach this time around, Franson felt good about returning to Rockford.\n\n\u201cRight away I reached out to my agent and asked him to reach out to Rockford to see if it would work just because I knew Kinger was there,\u201d Franson said. \u201cI loved playing for Kinger. We had a great relationship. Him and Anders took that approach of trying to use the brains around them to potentially bounce things off of, and Colly (Colliton) did the same thing when I was there for the first time. I really enjoyed my role and really enjoyed working with Kinger, Colly and Anders the first time. That just made it very easy to reach out and hope something would happen with Rockford obviously. I had great relationships with everyone that was there, and Kinger was a massive part of that.\u201d\n\nThe 2020-21 season was challenging for the IceHogs. There was everything COVID-related that all teams had to go through, but the IceHogs were also young and inexperienced. Franson had played more pro seasons than nearly all of the IceHogs\u2019 defensemen combined. A 9-4 loss to the Iowa Wild on March 3 gave them a 1-6-1 start to the season.\n\nKing and the IceHogs battled through the ensuing months, continued to focus on development more than anything and finished with a 12-19-1 record.\n\n\u201cI know last year was really tough in Rockford,\u201d Franson said. \u201cThey took a very developmental approach to it and it was a struggle. I think our group last year in Rockford came a long way. At the start, we were a group that was very young and very green and had a ton to learn, a lot more than you usually do with a team. Man, to be able to come out with a record that we came out with, just shows how much work he put in and how good of a coach he is because that wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do to turn that into a respectable season.\u201d\n\nDerek King has been with the Blackhawks organization since 2016. (Scott Powers / The Athletic)\n\nIt helped that King bought into what the Blackhawks were doing developmentally. He wasn\u2019t concerned about wins and losses as some AHL coaches can be when their sights are on becoming NHL coaches.\n\n\u201cObviously I think he wanted to be a head coach, at least in the American League, but I think he\u2019s not a guy who is on a certain track looking to make it to a certain place,\u201d said Tyler Sikura, who was a captain under King. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who enjoys what he\u2019s doing day to day. I think he was enjoying working with some of the younger guys. He has a couple of younger kids. He\u2019d bring them out for practice and things like that. It\u2019s a lot of pressure to be an NHL head coach. Obviously, when everybody\u2019s in this business, you want to have ultimate success, you want to make it there, but I don\u2019t think that was the kind of thing that struck you with him. \u2026 He\u2019s enjoying what he\u2019s doing and he loves being around the game and he loves being around the guys, and that\u2019s kind of his day-to-day approach.\u201d\n\nSorensen and King discussed that very topic during their last few seasons together.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve obviously gotten close over the years, and we\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about this,\u201d Sorensen. said. \u201cSo just being happy where your two feet are right now. Where you are right now, be happy with it and do the best and make the best out of that situation. \u201d\n\nRay Ferraro tuned into Derek King\u2019s introductory news conference as Blackhawks interim coach to see his former teammate.\n\n\u201cI was watching the press conference and Kinger\u2019s up there, he\u2019s fiddling around with the mic and his hands were on the mic, and the way he talked and the way he answered the questions, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my god, it\u2019s Kinger,'\u201d Ferraro said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same guy. He just got no hair. Because he had a long mane when we played. He didn\u2019t get to shaving it down until much later. But it looks very familiar. I was really happy to see him sitting there. I don\u2019t know. I was just really happy. I saw him out on the ice and he had a toque on. Like, it\u2019s just what I would expect.\u201d\n\nWearing a winter hat during practices is very unique to King.\n\n\u201cThe way he does, no, (I\u2019ve never had a coach do that),\u201d Tyler Sikura said. \u201cThat\u2019s his own style, I would say.\u201d\n\nFranson said while laughing, \u201cI think that Kinger\u2019s thing.\u201d\n\nWhile different, it does speak to King saying true to himself. When King was named Blackhawks interim coach, Eakins called him and reminded him of a few things. The conversation was a lot like what Bernard said to King when he became the IceHogs head coach.\n\n\u201cKinger played what, I don\u2019t know, probably 16 years or more pro, he\u2019s been coaching for a long time, too, so he has this vast amount of experience, as did I, but as much as you\u2019re ready, and you know you\u2019re ready, when you get that first job, there is the first few days like, holy man, I\u2019m a head coach of an NHL team,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cAnd I simply called him to remind him of how many games he played in the NHL, remember Al Arbour, remember Pat Quinn, remember all the lessons you\u2019ve learned along the way, and that he was 100 percent ready for this and to trust his instinct.\u201d\n\nKing doing just that throughout his career path, first as a player and now as a coach, has led to him accumulating a lot of people in his life who wish to see him do well.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people excited for that man,\u201d Eakins said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how my phone blew up from former staff people in other organizations, former players all, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s unbelievable for Kinger,\u2019 or, \u2018Do you have Kinger\u2019s new cell because the one I have isn\u2019t working.\u2019 It\u2019s amazing to me how much my phone blew up when he got the job. It\u2019s incredible because it\u2019s all people who love him and he\u2019s been able to have a positive effect on and influence. I think in the end, like, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a coach or what you do in your life, when something good is happening for you and people are excited for you, I think that\u2019s a real true mark on what mark you\u2019ve left on their lives.\u201d\n\n(Photo: Bill Smith / NHLI via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Derek_King_(Australian_footballer)", "page_content": "Derek King (7 September 1948 \u2013 28 April 2014) was an Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the late 1960s.\n\nAustralian rules footballer\n\nAustralian rules footballer\n\nQuick facts: Derek King, Personal information, Full n... \u25bc\n\nKing came into the St Kilda senior side after making his way up from the thirds but couldn't establish himself in the VFL.\n\nA rover, he played briefly in Western Australia with Swan Districts before joining Oakleigh in the Victorian Football Association.

He currently serves the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL as an assistant coach.\n\nNew fans of the ice hockey professional might be eager to learn about him. So, let's get to know more about Derek King and see how he went from playing to coaching in this biography.\n\nAn\u017ee Kopitar Biography - Hockey Player\n\nDerek King Net Worth And Career\n\nIncluding his career as an athlete and a coach, the former left winger has been actively involved in hockey for over 35 years. He must have bagged a massive fortune throughout the years. Likewise, Derek King's net worth must be immense.\n\nThe sportsman was drafted 13th overall by the New York Islanders in the NHL Entry Draft in 1985 and made his NHL debut in the 1986-87 season. He also played for Hartford Whalers, Toronto Maple Leafs, and St. Louis Blues of NHL. In addition, he also competed for different teams in leagues other than NHL. For example, King played for Grand Rapids Griffins in IHL and AHL and Oshawa Generals in the OHL. In his career as an NHL athlete, he played 830 games, scored 261 goals and 351 assists, and earned 612 points.\n\nNow, let's look at some of Derek's playing statistics in the table below:\n\nSeason Team Games Played Goals Scored Points 1996\u201397 New York Islanders 70 23 53 1997\u201398 Toronto Maple Leafs 77 21 46 1998\u201399 Toronto Maple Leafs 81 24 52\n\nTable Source: NHL Official Website\n\nAfter retiring from playing, the Hamilton native started his career as a coach in August 2009, when he became the assistant coach of the Toronto Marlies, the AHL affiliate team of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Five years later, in 2014, he was promoted to associate coach. Then, in July 2015, Derek became the OHL's Owen Sound Attack's assistant coach. However, he left the team in just three months, in October.\n\nFinally, in July 2016, King was named an assistant coach of the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League, which is the minor league affiliate of the Chicago Blackhawks. He was later promoted to the interim head coach of the IceHogs on November 6, 2018. Eventually, he landed his first head coaching position at the end of the 2018-19 season.\n\nThe 1967-born sportsperson became the interim head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL on November 2, 2021. Just a day later, he earned his first win with the Blackhawks, defeating the Nashville Predators. Sadly, he was let go from the position on June 27, 2022. However, on July 11, 2022, Chicago Blackhawks announced Derek's return as an assistant coach for the 2022-23 season.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, veteran assistant coaches, with little head coaching experience, earn between $500,000 and $700,000 per year. Since King also previously served as a head coach, he must also earn in a similar range. Hence, Derek King's net worth must be a significant amount.\n\nLikewise, John Gibson is another sports celebrity with a massive net worth.\n\nDerek King Is Happily Married\n\nAs the title suggests, the Canadian coach enjoys a blissful marital life with his partner. But unfortunately, little to no information about his beloved spouse is known to the public as of now. Even the name of his missus has not been disclosed yet, making it hard to find her on social media. In addition, Mrs. King completely stays away from the limelight. Perhaps she prefers to keep a low profile.\n\nNonetheless, Derek has talked about his other half a few times in some of his interviews. Once in an interview with Chicago Tribune, while talking about how hectic his NHL schedule is, he revealed that Mrs. King controlled everything and got everything figured out. He also added that she is a huge supporter of his career. Hopefully, we will get to learn more about Derek King's wife in the future.\n\nProud Father Of Three\n\nThe former left winger and his spouse are parents of three lovely boys. Their eldest is D.J. King, who was born on August 7, 2000, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Derek King's son is pursuing a career in hockey and following in his footsteps. He is a professional hockey player who competes in the East Coast Hockey League as a Defense for the Fort Wayne Komets.\n\nDerek King shares three lovely sons with his wife. Image Source: Derek King's Twitter.\n\nDerek King's other children are a set of twins who arrived when he was living in Arizona. But, as in the case of his wife, along with their birth details, the names of his baby boys remain a mystery. Regardless, according to the coach's bio on his Twitter account, his younger kids also love the game of hockey. They often go to the Rockford Hockey Club rink for games and practices. So, could the twins be planning on becoming ice hockey players in the future?\n\nIs From Hamilton\n\nThe coach was welcomed by his parents on February 11, 1967, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Sadly, information regarding Derek King's mother and father, including their names, has yet to be revealed. Likewise, he has not disclosed much about his other family members. Perhaps, his parents and siblings are people of privacy and want to stay away from the limelight.\n\nFurthermore, not much has been made known about the assistant coach himself. Due to this reason, it is difficult to learn about his childhood. It seems he is also a secretive person and isn't eager to share about his life before starting his hockey career.\n\nWell, it's unfortunate that Derek King has not opened up much about his personal life. Hopefully, we will learn about his parents, wife, and children in the days ahead. Nonetheless, with his fortune likely to grow with his career, he must enjoy a comfortable life. We wish him and his close ones lead a happy and prosperous life in the future.\n\nTrivia And Facts"}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2943532/2021/11/09/for-blackhawks-derek-king-and-ahl-player-d-j-king-a-missed-father-son-opportunity-makes-for-an-unforgettable-moment/", "page_content": "D.J. King awoke from his pregame nap on Saturday afternoon to his phone going off with text after text after text.\n\nEach one congratulated him.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Congrats for what?'\u201d King said on Monday.\n\nKing opened Twitter and learned his father, Derek King, had been promoted to Chicago Blackhawks interim head coach. The congratulatory messages instantly made sense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was so excited for him,\u201d D.J. said. \u201cHe\u2019s deserving. He\u2019s worked so hard for it.\u201d\n\nSaturday was going to be a special day for father and son regardless of the news, but that did change things. Prior to the announcement, Derek was scheduled to coach against D.J. for the first time \u2014 Derek coaching the Rockford IceHogs, the Blackhawks\u2019 AHL affiliate, at home against D.J., making his AHL debut, and the Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nWith Derek\u2019s promotion, the father-and-son matchup was no longer, but neither King was heartbroken. D.J. was excited for his dad\u2019s opportunity in the NHL, but it also worked out where Derek could really sit back and watch his son play. Coaching against him would have been different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably better off I didn\u2019t, probably send Ozzy (Dmitry Osipov) after him or something like that,\u201d Derek joked after the Blackhawks practice on Monday. \u201cIt was nice to watch. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re going there as a fan and watching him play. But, yeah, it was fine and I was happy for him. He looked pretty good out there and it\u2019s a step in the right direction for my kid.\u201d\n\nIt had been a while since Derek had been able to see D.J. play in person. With Derek\u2019s own busy coaching schedule, D.J. couldn\u2019t recall the last time that happened.\n\nD.J. King made his AHL debut on Saturday. (Todd Reichel / Rockford IceHogs)\n\nOn Saturday, Derek watched from an IceHogs press box with one of D.J.\u2019s younger brothers. D.J.\u2019s other brother and mother were at a hockey tournament, and they watched the game online. D.J. and Derek were able to catch up after the game.\n\n\u201cIt was great,\u201d D.J. said. \u201cHe was so excited. I\u2019m sure he was a little nervous for me watching up there. He was happy for me. He hasn\u2019t seen me play in a while now because of COVID last year. Yeah, he was really excited to watch me play. \u2026 It was a good Saturday night.\u201d\n\nAdding to the connection, Derek also once played for the Griffins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously special being able to put on a jersey that my dad once wore,\u201d D.J. said. \u201cI grew up a little bit in GR. I was just a little guy, though, so I don\u2019t remember much. Even the trainers\u2019 dog is still here. He remembers my dad when he played. He\u2019s told me some stories about me and my dad. It\u2019s been great coming here. I\u2019m really excited to be here so far.\u201d\n\nD.J., who is a defenseman because his dad convinced him at a young age he was better off there, felt like he had a solid debut for the Griffins and hopes to stick with the team. A day after his AHL debut, D.J. turned on the Blackhawks game on Sunday and saw his dad\u2019s NHL coaching debut. D.J. described it as \u201cunbelievable\u201d and \u201cfunny\u201d seeing his dad on the bench.\n\nD.J. said he couldn\u2019t be prouder of his father who has been a huge influence in his own career.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been my role model since the day I put on skates,\u201d D.J. said. \u201cKnowing how much success he had in his career, I know he\u2019s in my corner, I can talk to him whenever I can with things I\u2019m struggling with or things I need to work on. Like I said, he\u2019s just been a role model ever since. We just have a great relationship. It\u2019s just awesome.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day Sunday, D.J. touched base with his dad, but he knew Derek was exhausted from the previous two days.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he needed sleep, D.J. said. \u201cI let him be.\u201d\n\nDerek confirmed he needed just that.\n\n\u201cI passed out,\u201d Derek said of his postgame celebration. \u201cI had an ice-cold drink after and then I passed right out. I slept right through. I was tired. It was good.\u201d\n\nThose couple of days will certainly be forever remembered by father and son.\n\n(Photo: Jonathan Daniel / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://bettingsite.com.au/english-premier-league/australians/", "page_content": "There once was a time you could switch on the English Premier League on a Saturday night and be sure of seeing a few Australian players in action.\n\nThe days of Cahill, Emerton, Kewell, Viduka and Schwarzer are long gone now, but there remain one or two Socceroos stars running around in England\u2019s top flight.\n\nFollowing the deaprture of Aaron Mooy to the CSL in the transfer window before the start of the 2020/21 season, it has left Aussies cheering just two Socceroos in the EPL.\n\nRyan burst onto the scene with Central Coast Mariners in 2010 after first-choice keeper Jess Vanstrattan went down with a ruptured ACL. After some early jitters, he made the spot his own and helped steer the Mariners to the 2011 A-League Grand Final, where he won the Joe Marston Medal for best on ground despite a penalty shootout defeat to Brisbane Roar.\n\nTwo more impressive seasons in Gosford earned Ryan a trade to Belgian side Club Brugge in 2013. Two years later, he became only the third Australian to play in La Liga when Valencia signed him on a six-year deal. An ill-timed injury ruined his chances of nailing down a starting place, however, and he was loaned to Racing Genk before penning a five-year deal with Brighton & Hove Albion in 2017.\n\nThe Seagulls were newly promoted to the Premier League when Ryan joined them. He proved his worth from the off, making 124 saves \u2013 third in league \u2013 as Brighton secured their top-flight status for another season.\n\nHaving been a main-stay throughout the last three years for Brighton, Ryan was loaned out during the winter transfer window to powerhouse club Arsenal after falling out of favour with the Brighton management during the first half of the 2020/21 premier league season.\n\nThere have been 52 Australians to have played in the English top flight, but only a select few have made more than 50 appearances.\n\nMark Schwarzer 514 Premier League Appearances Did you know that Mark Schwarzer was the first player born outside of England to appear in 500 or more Premier League games? He notched that milestone at age 40 in 2013, during one of his 172 games for Fulham. The New South Welshman also made 325 EPL appearances for Middlesbrough and finished his career with stints at Chelsea and Leicester City. While not as controversial as Mark Bosnich, nor as recognisable as Harry Kewell or Tim Cahill, Schwarzer has been a constant for the Socceroos since he made his debut against Canada in a World Cup qualifier way back in 1993. He retired from internationals in 2013 after two FIFA World Cup finals and a record 109 caps.\n\nLucas Neill 279 Premier League Appearances | 6 Goals The rumble is former Socceroos\u2019 captain Lucas Neill could be returning to Australia \u2013 in the New South Wales National Premier League. Not the sort of place you\u2019d expect a guy who spent 10 years in the English Premier League to bob up, but we guess that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re 37. Neill was known as one of our toughest players and captained the country for a long period after Mark Viduka passed on the job in 2006. He has given great service as a defender with Blackburn Rovers, West Ham and Everton in the English Premier League. Neill spent the 2014 season with Watford, which had just made it back in the top flight.\n\nHarry Kewell 274 Premier League Appearances | 57 Goals Many felt he was our greatest international representative before Cahill came along and stole the show. That\u2019s probably why he left the Everton great out of his best Socceroo team of all time. But, while his judgement might have been affected, there\u2019s no arguing with his ability. Kewell was a superstar, both in international and Premier League play. The leader of Australia\u2019s \u2018Golden Generation\u2019 Kewell debuted for Leeds as a teen and is still the only Australian who owns a UEFA Champions League title. He won the FA Cup after he moved to Liverpool when Leeds struck money troubles and, despite always seeming to battle injury, he was considered the most naturally talented player ever to step on the pitch for Australia. He struck 45 times in 181 appearances for Leeds, making him one of the club\u2019s best attacking midfielders ever.\n\nBrett Emerton 247 Premier League Appearances | 13 Goals Australia\u2019s fourth most capped international player enjoyed a long Premier League stint with Blackburn Rovers. He made 247 appearances with Rovers after crossing from Feyenoord in 2003 and scored 13 goals for the club. The AIS product was so loved at Ewood Park that the club let him out of the last year of his contract without financial penalty so he could return home and play for Sydney FC in the twilight of his career.\n\nMark Viduka 240 Premier League Appearances | 92 Goals The gun centre forward was known for his ability to control the ball and set up play up front in 240 Premier League appearances with Leeds, Middlesbrough and Newcastle United. The big fella banged in 92 goals in that time, with some serious highlights to boot. None of those were greater than the day he fired in all four goals in Leeds 4-3 win over Liverpool. It\u2019s always good when Liverpool loses, especially at the hands (or feet) of an Australian. Viduka scored 11 goals in 43 appearances for the Socceroos. Big Duke retired from professional football in 2009.\n\nTim Cahill 226 Premier League Appearances | 56 Goals For some bizarre reason, the Socceroos\u2019 greatest goal scorer isn\u2019t in Harry Kewell\u2019s best ever Australian team. Jewell has either lost the plot or has taken some sort of umbrage with the star striker. Regardless of his standing in the international realm, Cahill was a hero at his beloved club Everton. He spent eight years Merseyside scoring 56 goals in 210 appearances and is known as one of the club\u2019s best players of the Premier League era and its second top scorer ever. Purchased by then manager David Moyes for the tiny sum of 1.5 million pounds, Cahill proved to be one of the Premier League\u2019s best ever bargains. Cahill spent time in the American MLS with New York Red Bulls, but now plies his trade in China with Shanghai Shenhua, where he has become a cult figure of epic proportions in the soccer mad Asian country. The evergreen Cahill, at 35, is still turning out for Australia and still scoring goals, including one of the best you will ever see during the World Cup against the Dutch.\n\nMark Bosnich 206 Premier League Appearances Bozza is now better known as the friendly face on Fox Sports\u2019 English Premier League coverage nowadays, but did you know he was once one of the most controversial figures in the Premier League? You don\u2019t get signed as the number one goal keeper for power house Manchester United if you don\u2019t have talent oozing out of you. And Bosnich was arguably the best Australian goal keeper ever. He had two stints at United as well as a lengthy stay at Aston Villa, where he made 179 appearances. His time at Chelsea was cut short when he failed a drug test and was banned for nine months. He won the Premier League title with United, but was later called a \u201cterrible professional\u201d by none other than legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Bozza, always quick witted, retorted: \u201cThe fact remains that I was the only player he signed twice at Manchester United. I\u2019m honoured to be mentioned. He\u2019s entitled to his view and I\u2019m entitled to mine.\u201d\n\nStan Lazaridis 166 Premier League Appearances | 7 Goals In the late 1990\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s Stan Lazaridis was a mainstay in both West Ham\u2019s and Birmingham City\u2019s midfields. It was at Birmingham City where Stan made his biggest impact, apearing 191 times in all comeptitions for the club up until the end of the 2005-06 season where he was released and made his way back home to join the Perth Glory. Lazaridis, who appeared 60 times for the Socceroos would not grace a field again post 2008 after testing positive to an illicit drug and thus curtailing his career.\n\nAaron Mooy 96 Premier League Appearances | 9 Goals Aaron Mooy had a largely successful stint in the premier league with Huddersfield Town in the 2017-18 season and managed to help the Terriers stay in the Premier League until the end of the 2018-19 season where they were relegated back to the Championship. Many experts expected Mooy to remain in the Premier League despite Huddersfield being relegated, and he did when signing for Brighton for the 2019-20 Premier League season. Mooy has since jetted off to the Chinese Super League, but many predict the Socceroos midfielder to be back in the Premier League sooner rather than later.\n\nMile Jedinak 90 Premier League Appearances | 6 Goals Former socceroo captain Mile Jedinak was a crucial element to the Crystal Palace midfield from 2013-2016 as the club continually battled relegation. Jedinak played just 100 matches in the top flight of English football and was always a dominant force in defence for Palace, as well as causing trouble for opposition defences at set pieces. The former socceroo announced his retirement in 2019 after spending a couple of years at Aston Villa plying his trade in the EFL Championship.\n\nRobbie Slater 84 Premier League Appearances | 4 Goals Bozza\u2019s partner in crime on the Fox Sports commentary team, Robbie Slater was actually born in the UK but played for the Socceroos. Slater hopped to four teams in England, spending time with Blackburn Rovers, West Ham United, Southampton and Woverhampton Wanderers. But his finest moment in football will forever be his English Premier League title with Blackburn Rovers. \u201cLooking back, it\u2019s unbelievable! If you play for long enough in the Premier League but don\u2019t win it of course you\u2019ve had a a great career \u2014 look at Timmy Cahill, a Premier League legend, Harry as well. But it\u2019s a great thing that I can look back on, and Bozza as well. It\u2019s special. I was lucky to move at the right time and right circumstances. OK I didn\u2019t play every game but we only used 17 players. I was an integral part of it, finished with six or seven assists and hit the post four or five bloody times!\u201d\n\nJohn Filan 74 Premier League Appearances The former Socceroo goalkeeper managed to represent three top flight teams throughout his career. He first made an appearance in the Premier League representing Coventry City, before heading to Blackburn Rovers in the late 90\u2019s. Filan then made a further 25 appearances for Wigan Athletic in the mid 2000\u2019s, who Filan represented 184 times throughout all competitions between 2001 and 2007."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/derek-king-1/", "page_content": "Derek King (7 September 1948 - 28 April 2014) was an Australian rules footballer who played for St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the late 1960s.\n\nKing came into the St Kilda senior side after making his way up from the thirds but couldn't establish himself in the VFL.\n\nA rover, he played briefly in Western Australia with Swan Districts before joining Oakleigh in the Victorian Football Association. He played his best football at Oakleigh, winning two Association best and fairest awards: the first division's J. J. Liston Trophy in 1975, and then the second division's J. Field Trophy in 1977, when he polled a record 67 votes. he also placed second by a single vote for the Liston Trophy in 1976, and third in 1970. He transferred to first division team Caulfield in 1978, and placed third for the Liston Trophy again in 1980.\n\nHis son, Clinton King, was an AFL player at three separate clubs.\n\nHe died from cancer on 28 April 2014, aged 65."}, {"url": "https://theathletic.com/2995017/2021/12/02/derek-king-believes-the-blackhawks-scorers-will-start-scoring-and-hes-getting-them-to-believe-too/", "page_content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 From 1991 to 1994, Derek King was a goal-scoring machine. He potted 108 goals for the New York Islanders during those three seasons \u2014 more than Wayne Gretzky, more than Jaromir Jagr, more than Mark Messier, more than Steve Larmer, more than Tony Amonte.\n\nDuring that three-season span, King never went more than seven games without a goal. Heck, he rarely went more than two or three.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the following season, 1994-95, King scored in the third and fourth games after the lockout ended, then had just one goal in his next 14 games. In 1995-96, he had one goal in his first 17 games, then later had an 11-game goal-less drought. In 1996-97, he had a stretch of one goal in 20 games and another of two goals in 17. In 1997-98, he had one goal in 17 games, then a 12-game drought. He finished those last two seasons with 26 and 21 goals, respectively and respectably.\n\nSo the Blackhawks\u2019 interim coach knows exactly how Jonathan Toews feels. And Patrick Kane. And Dominik Kubalik. And Kirby Dach.\n\nFrustrated. Furious. Flailing and fishing for answers.\n\n\u201cI was streaky,\u201d King said. \u201cI drove coaches nuts. When I was on a streak, it was fun. When I wasn\u2019t on a streak, I did the same thing (as them): I started second-guessing myself.\u201d\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s spirited 4-3 shootout win over the first-place Capitals, Kane now has one goal in 11 games. Dach hasn\u2019t scored in 15 straight. Toews hadn\u2019t scored in 15 months. And Kubalik\u2019s power-play goal in Washington was his first tally in 16 games. That\u2019s four of the top six mired in prolonged scoring droughts for a team that doesn\u2019t have much scoring beyond that top six. It\u2019s kind of a problem.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I have a grayness in my beard,\u201d King said, stroking his chin beneath a wry smile.\n\nBut King\u2019s experience as a player has informed his upbeat, don\u2019t-sweat-it philosophy. It also makes that philosophy an easier sell to players who might be less willing to hear it from a coach with less playing experience.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, I think the squeezing of the stick is just your confidence \u2014 you don\u2019t feel like you could score anymore,\u201d King said. \u201cI always say it\u2019s like riding the bike. Having (not) ridden a bike for 20 years, once you get on the bike that first time and start pedaling, you find out you can do it still. It\u2019s the same (for) goal scorers. Guys that are just naturally skilled or are good goal scorers, you don\u2019t lose it. The only thing you lose is that confidence. So the big thing for them is try to be composed, don\u2019t put pressure on yourself, and just play. But usually, it takes a defenseman shooting the puck and it hits you in the butt or off your head or shoulder, it\u2019s like a crazy goal that goes in, and then all of a sudden you just take a deep breath and you\u2019re like, \u2018All right, I\u2019m on the scoresheet.\u2019 That\u2019s the biggest thing. Just getting on the scoresheet helps so much.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that said, it\u2019s a challenge to stay positive amid a goal drought. I wrote at length about the internal struggle every player deals with at some point in their career and how difficult \u2014 and sometimes, as King alluded to, random \u2014 it can be to bust out of it.\n\nAs Dach put it, \u201cI\u2019d be lying to you if I said it doesn\u2019t suck.\u201d But in video sessions with King and his staff, the focus hasn\u2019t been on missed opportunities. Rather, it\u2019s been on all the positive things that are happening during their shifts. A good defensive play here, a nice pass there, a quality zone entry here. All the little things that should \u2014 and eventually will, if mathematical regression has anything to say about it \u2014 add up to goals.\n\nFor Kubalik, the law of averages finally might have kicked in during the second period, when he scored a power-play goal off the rush to put the Blackhawks up 2-1. You could almost see the weight lift off his shoulders with his ferocious fist-pump.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying right now,\u201d Kubalik said before the game. \u201cAlways trying to watch my shifts with the coaches and talk most of the time about the positive things, especially away from the puck. Obviously, it\u2019s nice to do something that brings us success. But on the other side, you\u2019re not going to score every night, so you\u2019ve got to find a way to help the team in other ways.\u201d\n\nThe pressure on Kubalik has been even greater than on the other three slumping stars. He\u2019ll be a restricted free agent this summer, and interim general manager Kyle Davidson is still trying to determine whether Kubalik will be part of the Blackhawks\u2019 future. If he starts scoring again, he should get his first big multiyear payday, a raise from his current cap hit of $3.7 million. He\u2019d also become a more attractive trade chip who could get sent to a contender ahead of the trade deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs it stands, he\u2019s suddenly a third-liner (with Henrik Borgstr\u00f6m and Jujhar Khaira instead of Toews and Brandon Hagel) with one five-on-five goal all season.\n\nBut Kubalik, generally an upbeat guy, said his future isn\u2019t on his mind.\n\n\u201cI (didn\u2019t) even think about it the years before,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just another year. It\u2019s the first normal year for me in the NHL, which is nice, finally. I know that my starts of the seasons the last two years weren\u2019t good, too, and I always found a way to come back. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nHe has a point. Like King outside of those three dynamite seasons, Kubalik has been streaky since coming to the NHL. Last year, he scored in just two of the first 15 games before scoring 14 in the next 35, and even that stretch included droughts of five, four and four games. As a rookie, he had eight goals in his first 34 games before ripping off 21 goals in his next 29 games. That, of course, coincided with his rise from the third line to the top line, however. This year, Kubalik has been in the top six pretty much all season until recently, and he hasn\u2019t produced.\n\nThis time around, King\u2019s hoping the line demotion will spark him.\n\n\u201cHopefully, that gets him working in the offensive zone a little harder, because those guys will push that,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll make him come and help in the corners and stuff, and I think when he does that, he\u2019ll create more opportunities for himself.\u201d\n\nOffensively, that\u2019s where the Blackhawks are \u2014 throwing anything against the wall and hoping it sticks the puck in the net. Kubalik on a grinder line? Sure. Uniting Kane and Toews on the top line? Go for it. Dropping Alex DeBrincat to the second power-play unit, giving Kubalik a mirror image one-timer in the opposite circle? Why not? Putting Dach between the built-in chemistry of DeBrincat and Dylan Strome? Can\u2019t hurt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis deep in the hole, and this deep into the droughts, it\u2019s just a matter of trusting the work, trusting the law of averages and trusting the coach when he says to relax. It finally worked for Kubalik. It\u2019ll eventually work for the others. It has to, right?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen a puck go in, obviously,\u201d said Toews, who made a vintage power move to the net in the first period, only to hit the post, and was later robbed by Vitek Vanecek. \u201cI definitely like scoring goals. So I\u2019d like to get going in that area. Just got to keep working through it. I\u2019m not really sure what else to say at this point.\u201d\n\nToews said that 10 days ago. He could have said it 10 minutes ago. He \u2014 and Kubalik, and Kane, and Toews \u2014 can only hope he\u2019s not still saying it 10 days from now.\n\nFive thoughts and observations\n\n1. Nobody wants to be known as a low-event hockey team. But with their third straight strong defensive performance \u2014 and their first win in Washington in nearly 16 years \u2014 that appears to be the Blackhawks\u2019 new identity.\n\nJust don\u2019t say it out loud.\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re saying, (but) I don\u2019t want to say our identity is low-event hockey,\u201d King said. \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for it. We have to manage the puck. That\u2019s the biggest thing with our team. We can\u2019t afford to turn pucks over against a lot of these teams, because they\u2019re good teams.\u201d\n\nThe safe, smart style of hockey worked against Washington. Other than a poor start to the second period and a frantic final few minutes of regulation, the Blackhawks had one of their best efforts of the season against a very good Capitals team. They were patient. They were careful. They dumped the puck when they didn\u2019t have a clear entry. They got back on defense when they anticipated a change in possession.\n\nAnd they still generated scoring chances by pouncing in transition. It\u2019s clearly a recipe for success, too, after beating St. Louis, playing well in a loss to San Jose and knocking off the Caps. Washington hitting five posts didn\u2019t hurt, but Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury made 25 of his own saves. Most importantly, the Blackhawks were credited with only three giveaways all game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe always talk about greasy road wins,\u201d said Jones, who wired in the equalizer at 11:56 of the third after Garnet Hathaway scored on a breakaway right out of the penalty box in the opening minute. \u201cThe crowd\u2019s not on our side, we have to create our own energy, and you don\u2019t do that by turning pucks over and giving them odd-man rushes. So I thought we did a great job of taking the crowd out of it in the first, sticking to our game, keeping it low event. That\u2019s just giving ourselves a chance.\u201d\n\n2. With his parents, wife, sister-in-law and trainer in attendance at Capital One Center, Josiah Slavin had a terrific NHL debut, centering the fourth line with Mike Hardman and Ryan Carpenter. The trio had several scoring chances early on, and Slavin picked up his first point by setting up Jones\u2019 goal in the third period.\n\nSlavin entered the offensive zone and stickhandled his way through traffic, then peeled back rather than simply dump the puck in. As he turned, he saw Jones barreling down the middle of the ice with nobody near him. Slavin made the pass, and Jones blistered a wrist shot past Vanecek to tie it 3-3.\n\nSlavin was on the ice for 13 shot attempts for and just six against, with seven scoring chances (four of them high-danger) in barely 10 minutes of ice time. He also got a shift on the Blackhawks\u2019 lone penalty kill.\n\n\u201cThe first one, you never know going into it, right?\u201d Slavin said. \u201cSo I think to get it out of the way was good, and I think I\u2019ll be more comfortable in the next one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks extremely comfortable out there,\u201d Jones countered. \u201cBig body down the middle, was making plays out of our own end, skating through the neutral zone with speed and creating offensively. He set up (Hardman) a couple times off the rush for some great chances. I thought he looked great. He didn\u2019t look out of place at all and definitely helped us get the win tonight.\u201d\n\n3. Dach\u2019s inability to finish has been an issue for all three of his NHL seasons and is the one thing that seems to prevent him from taking that next step into a true No. 1 center. But his unwillingness to even try to finish is an issue as well.\n\nIn the second period, Strome made a terrific move down the right wing to set up Dach on the doorstep. Dach had time and space and a point-blank shot on Vanecek, but he hesitated for a split second, then forced a tricky backdoor pass back to Strome that failed to connect. Sometimes, you just have to shoot the puck. Dach basically predicted the play earlier in the day.\n\n\u201cYou kind of get in the situations where you\u2019re gripping the stick a little bit too tight or trying to set up the perfect backdoor play where you go through the seams two or three times,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you get in slumps like this, it\u2019s never a bad idea just to shoot the puck.\u201d\n\nAfter the game, King joked he\u2019d have to \u201cwhip him with a hose\u201d to get Dach to start shooting the puck.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just keep beating it in him (to) shoot,\u201d King said. \u201cWe need more shots. We have to have a shooting mentality.\u201d\n\n4. Connor Murphy was knocked out of the game 22 seconds into the second period when Alex Ovechkin hit him hard along the boards. Murphy was slow to get up and had to be helped off the ice and back to the dressing room. King didn\u2019t have any details or an update after the game.\n\nIn other injury news, Riley Stillman made a surprise appearance at the morning skate, and King said he\u2019d be a game-time decision. He wasn\u2019t on the ice for warmups, however, and was scratched along with Calvin de Haan (back) and Reese Johnson (healthy). King was hopeful de Haan would return to the lineup either Saturday against the Rangers or Sunday against the Islanders. With de Haan out, the resurgent and defensively improved Erik Gustafsson was on the top pairing with Jones.\n\n5. The Blackhawks traded Malcolm Subban to goalie-starved Buffalo on Thursday for \u201cfuture considerations,\u201d which could mean anything but most likely means nothing. The Sabres needed goaltending with Craig Anderson hurt and Dustin Tokarski in COVID-19 protocol, and the Blackhawks needed to clear their logjam in Rockford. Subban had been splitting time with fellow veteran Collin Delia and potential goalie-of-the-near-future Arvid S\u00f6derblom, and nobody benefits from that situation.\n\nSubban, acquired from Vegas in the Robin Lehner trade, was a solid backup for Kevin Lankinen last season and will get his third real chance to prove he\u2019s an NHL goalie with the Sabres.\n\n(Photo of Dominik Kubalik and Alex DeBrincat: Rob Carr / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/31677/derek-king", "page_content": "Edit Mode\n\nGo Premium to enter Edit Mode\n\nTake control of your EliteProspects profile!

This is because the former Leeds United and Liverpool star had the kind of playing career that --rightly or wrongly --usually means that you get to start your coaching journey higher up the pyramid than would be the case for your average journeyman professional.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat career gave Kewell a major advantage when going into coaching.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile walking straight into a Premier League position was always going to be difficult given that the best coaches in the world are working there at the moment, others have found the Championship a realistic option.\n\n\n\n\n\nKewell\u2019s former Leeds team-mate Lee Bowyer walked straight into the Charlton role. Scott Parker\u2019s first coaching job was with Fulham, a team that could return to the Premier League on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nKewell\u2019s playing career outstripped that pair. He was a bigger name.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is probably true that leaving England before the end of his playing career has made it more difficult. It is better for a famous player to move into coaching before the mud dries on their boots. Kewell moved to the edge of the English radar after leaving Liverpool and fell off it completely upon departing Turkish giants Galatasaray.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps it could have worked had he taken a job in Australia. Had the former winger coached in the A-League --and what an intriguing prospect that would have been --and had success, it could have made for an interesting combination. A player with a successful career and with overseas success as a young coach, there would surely have been opportunities back in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is true that football does not always work like that and hindsight does play a part but Kewell\u2019s coaching trajectory is flatter than it could have been. It could also be argued that his nationality is a minus as Australians simply don't coach in Europe -- or don't get the chance to -- but Kewell's reputation was big enough, in my opinion, to have transcended all that.\n\n\n\n\n\nKewell may be aware of the risks in taking the Oldham job but becoming the coach of Crawley, as he did in 2017, was also a risk. Once you start in the lower leagues then it is very difficult to break out. As soon as Kewell is at Crawley then his playing career means less. He is the manager of a fourth-tier club first and a former World Cup star second.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lower leagues of England are brutal for coaches and few last long at one club. A lack of money means that players tend to be on short-term contracts and the constant turnover makes it really difficult to build anything meaningful. Eddie Howe managed it at Bournemouth, taking over that club in a similar position but such stories are not common.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter Crawley, it was Notts County, a historic club that had fallen on hard times. It was short and not sweet for the Australian though those two months plus must have been quite a learning experience.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it is north-west to Oldham. While there has been talk of restoring a former English Premier League side to that glory, the Latics are no sleeping giant but a club that had a heady spell in the early nineties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may be ambition at Boundary Park (one of the coldest places to watch football in the world) and it is to be hoped that Kewell takes the team back up the leagues because if not, then it is hard to see where, in England at least, he can go from Oldham.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt could be that overseas in the answer. Asia perhaps, a place where Kewell is remembered for a glittering playing career and where any coaching spell in England tends to be looked on positively.\n\n\n\n"}]}
