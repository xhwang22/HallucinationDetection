Fiji Water and parent company Roll Global are buying Sonoma's Landmark Vineyards, known for high-quality Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Syrah. The deal includes the winery, inventory and an 11-acre vineyard. The sale price was not disclosed.\n\nIn December, Roll Global purchased its first wine property\u2014Justin Winery in Paso Robles\u2014and company officials told Wine Spectator they plan to continue building a wine portfolio.\n\n\"We felt [Landmark] met our profile for a good quality brand, and what I'd consider the affordable premium area,\" said Stewart Resnick, chairman and owner of Roll Global, the Los Angeles-based holding company that owns Fiji Water, one of the largest brands of imported bottled water. Roll's holdings also include Pom Wonderful pomegranate juice, flower delivery service Teleflora, Paramount citrus, which grows and sells fresh citrus, and Paramount Farms, which does the same for almonds and pistachios.\n\nBill Mabry and his family founded Landmark in 1974 in Windsor, Calif. One of the original investors, Damaris Deere Ethridge, took over control in 1989 and relocated the firm to Sonoma Valley, where she built a winery. Ethridge is a descendant of John Deere, founder of the world's largest tractor manufacturer.\n\nHer son Michael Deere Colhoun and his wife Mary joined the company in 1992 as her partners, and the couple became the face of the winery. They hired consultant Helen Turley and winemaker Eric Stern, and the wines improved. The Overlook Chardonnay has appeared on Wine Spectator's Top 100 list six times.\n\n\"I'm sure it will be gut-wrenching in certain ways, but very liberating in other ways,\" said Mike Colhoun. \"[The sale] was a good fit for us because we have two children that aren't in the wine business. We had no exit strategy.\"\n\n\"It's bittersweet,\" said Mary, noting that wine has been at the center of their life for 20 years. \"This is an extraordinary opportunity for Landmark. Roll totally understands what our brand is about\u2014quality and excellence in agriculture\u2014because they are about the same things.\"\n\nLandmark owns an 11-acre vineyard but buys most of its grapes from several well-known vineyards, including Heintz, Kanzler, Sangiacomo and Bien Nacido. Roll plans to continue with the current contracts, and possibly expand the brand, which makes about 20,000 cases a year. \"Look, we're farmers at heart,\" said Resnick. \"They have good sources, we'll go carefully, making sure we maintain their quality.\" The Colhouns will no longer be involved, but winemaker Greg Stach will stay on.\n\nResnick said that the Fiji sales force will be able to sell the wine side of the business too. \"There's a lot of good wines around. But the problem is that people don't know how to get them to market,\" said Resnick. \"We think we're good at getting them to market.\""}, {"url": "https://www.bevnet.com/news/2004/11-29-2004-fiji_water_acquired_roll_international.asp", "page_content": "Privately held Roll International Corporation announced today that it has acquired FIJI Water LLC.

It is clear that the wine industry is in the midst of a strong planting cycle, and we believe in the long-term prospects for grape growing.

A portion of the research will focus on decomposable plastics, along with tackling issues of water, energy, food, and waste in a world confronting rapid climate change.\n\nFIJI Water will further reach its sustainability goals through new packaging innovations and plastic reduction that advance the independent brand beyond pledges made by the largest global beverage companies.\n\nAs an alternative to single-use bottles, FIJI Water will introduce a new 2.5-gallon packaging option for the refrigerator or counter and a 5-gallon option designed to fit in a standard hot and cold water dispenser. Both options will utilize up to 76 percent less plastic\u2014in the case of the 5-gallon option, an estimated equivalent of 38 fewer 500mL bottles.

The company was still permitted to say that the product had health benefits.\n\nOn their website, https://www.pomtruth.com, the Resnicks note that \u201cout of 600 print and outdoor ads, the judge found less than 2% misleading.\u201d They invited consumers to view \u201csome of the other 98%.\u201d\n\nThe website included links to Pom Wonderful advertisements, including some that promoted the juice as \u201cDeath Defying,\u201d \u201cHealth\u2019s Angel\u201d and a \u201cLife Preserver.\u201d Those claims are based on the idea that pomegranate juice contains health-promoting antioxidants.\n\nPom\u2019s website contains flattering comments from Chappell\u2019s ruling, including his finding that \u201cpomegranate juice is a natural fruit product with health-promoting characteristics. The safety of pomegranate juice is not in doubt.\u201d\n\nThe website says Chappell rejected the FTC\u2019s efforts to require Pom to receive Food and Drug Administration approval before promoting health benefits of its products. He also declined to require the company to pay for double-blind, placebo-controlled studies before making health claims.\n\nKit Yarrow, a professor at Golden Gate University in San Francisco who specializes in consumer psychology, said Pom\u2019s response is \u201ca really sophisticated P.R. campaign and a sign of our times.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me, the idea that a company is taking their message to consumers directly like this is completely fresh,\u201d Yarrow said. \u201cIt\u2019s a really new way of approaching this kind of problem.\u201d\n\nShe said she thought it would be effective.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point where consumers distrust the government enough, they\u2019re willing to believe the business over the very agency that\u2019s designed to protect them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting more free mileage by fighting this than they ever could possibly spend in advertising. Did you ever think about Pom before? Well, now you are.\u201d\n\nAugust Hovarth, an attorney who specializes in advertising law at Kelley, Drye & Warren in New York, said he thought the Resnicks\u2019 response was counterproductive. The appeal will eventually be heard by five FTC commissioners who may be put off by the public relations blitz, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is something that a lot of companies that are not happy about an FTC order would like to do, but someone sensible talks them out of it,\u201d Hovarth said. \u201cPom is really in their face with it.\u201d\n\nWhether the FTC ruling has affected Pom Wonderful sales is unclear.\n\n\u201cAs a private company we don\u2019t speak about sales results,\u201d Corey Martin, a spokesman for Pom, said in an email.\n\nBut there are some indications that sales might be slowing, at least at some specialty health food shops.\n\nAt Erewhon Natural Food Market on Beverly Boulevard in Los Angeles\u2019 Fairfax neighborhood, sales of Pom Wonderful\u2019s pomegranate juice has decreased significantly in recent weeks, said the store\u2019s owner, Tony Antoci.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a decline,\u201d Antoci said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it has anything to do with the FTC. But customers who shop at my store, health is a primary concern. They would be more aware of what\u2019s going on than someone shopping at Ralphs.\u201d\n\nPom Wonderful is one of several successful brands that the Resnicks control through their company, Roll Global. Among them: Fiji Water, florist network Teleflora and Paramount Citrus, which produces Cuties, the popular Clementine oranges. They are also one of the world\u2019s largest growers of almonds and pistachios.\n\nForbes magazine estimated the Resnicks\u2019 net worth at $2 billion. The Resnicks have used their wealth to make a $45-million contribution to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which opened the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Exhibition Pavilion.\n\nIn a 2010 interview with The Times, Lynda Resnick said she thought Marie Antoinette could have avoided the guillotine if she had better managed public relations.\n\n\u201cA great deal of her bad press was manufactured by her enemies,\u201d she said. \u201cShe needed a better publicist.\u201d\n\nstuart.pfeifer@latimes.com"}, {"url": "https://www.made-in-china.com/showroom/englandtong", "page_content": "We are Asian sourcing office of our US headquarter - Roll International Corporation.
