He is the founding director of the UK\u2019s National Science Learning Centre.\n\nJohn Holman\n\nSir John Holman is President of the Royal Society of Chemistry and an Emeritus Professor at the University of York, UK. He is the founding director of the UK\u2019s National Science Learning Centre. In addition to having been a headteacher at Watford Grammar School for Boys, Sir John has previously been the British government\u2019s National STEM Director.\n\nIn 2014 he was named by the Science Council as one of the UK\u2019s leading 100 practising scientists. Sir John is a trustee of the National History Museum.\n\nSkills\n\nWhat are the skills we need to be teaching our children?\n\n100 years is a very long time, and we can\u2019t possibly predict what the world will be like in 2116, so we have to resort to saying what do we think our youngsters will need for the future. Of course that includes a lot of things such as the ability to communicate in mother tongue languages, mathematics, but it also includes a whole set of softer skills, or we should say high order skills, about interaction with other people.\n\nIn 100 years time, our daily lives will definitely involve interaction with other people. I think we need to get a much better understanding of those high order skills, things like teamwork, communication, working with others and leadership. We need to understand how people develop those skills and how we can measure them.\n\nTeachers\n\nWhat is the role of the teacher?\n\nWe will still have teachers in 100 years time and I think the teacher is absolutely critical. For many years we have been predicting the disappearance of the teacher. For instance, in 1913 Thomas Edison said: \u2018Soon teachers will not be necessary, because children will be taught entirely through motion pictures.\u2019 This was at the dawn of the movie age and of course that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThere is something about the transaction and interaction between humans that is central to the life of all humans and to the way people learn. I\u2019m absolutely convinced that individual teachers will still be at the heart of the educational process. Therefore, they are right at the center of making education as good as we can possibly make it. We need to make sure that they are highly skilled, that very highly qualified people come into education, that they are well trained and have good continued training, and that they are also highly respected and trusted.\n\nI have seen schools in Finland and one of the things I\u2019m struck by is the trust adults, the community, and parents put in teachers to make the right judgements. We need more of that across the world.\n\nAssessment\n\nDo you think standardized testing is an effective way to assess learning?\n\nIt depends what you\u2019re testing and we have to test at some point throughout young people\u2019s education experience. The parents expect it, the public expects it and it\u2019s a way to hold the whole system to account, certainly in the United Kingdom. I know countries where there is less emphasis on it.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think testing in itself is the wrong thing, but I think we have to think very carefully about what we test. The big danger is, and I think this was attributed to Einstein, is that not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts. In other words, it\u2019s actually quite easy to measure some things and to get very robust results from them - a straightforward record of facts, easy to measure, reliable results. But these aren\u2019t necessarily the things that matter, so I think we have to think very carefully about what we are testing.\n\nI am very excited about the potential of digital technologies making testing much more sophisticated. We do need to test some basic knowledge, but we also need to test high level thinking skills, the ability to reason, solve problems and the ability to work with other people and to show leadership and teamwork - some of those skills that I was referring to before.\n\nI think one of the things we will see happening over the next 100 years is a better ability to measure higher level skills that lead to high employability, and that this will probably happen through digital methods.\n\nEnvironments\n\nWhat would be the most exciting learning environment?\n\nI think people young and old learn by doing things, and so I would always want them to be in an environment where they can learn by doing, hands-on. As the virtual world becomes more and more powerful and realistic and we can enter through the virtual simulated world, I think the real world becomes more important. As people realize there is a virtual world out there that can give them anything, for example we can all go to the moon in a simulation, the real world becomes more important by contrast.\n\nFor example, at the National History Museum where I am a trustee, we are going through a process where we make sure that everything that people see is authentic - real fossils, real meteorites, and I think that authenticity of the experience is going to become more important.\n\nSo my ideal learning environment is where people can learn by doing. As a science specialist, my ideal environment is a highly equipped laboratory with all the facilities needed to carry out experiments at any point in any lesson that the teacher wants to. Or a highly equipped field station where people can go out into the natural world and learn about the natural world by doing and experiencing it.\n\nPersonal memory\n\nWhat was your favorite moment in your own education?\n\nI am a chemist and I studied chemistry at university. I had a very good chemistry teacher who was rather tough. He wasn\u2019t a wild enthusiast who was always making jokes, he was very serious, but he was brilliant at giving you problems that would stretch you. My most memorable experience was when I was around sixteen, he gave me an orange powder and said: \u2018find out everything about that,\u2019 and didn\u2019t give me any help leaving me to my own devices. I had to go make tests on it, add other chemicals to it, analyze it and in the end I nearly found out what it was and we had a really good discussion about it.\n\nI felt that it was such a journey of discovery. I was doing experiments, it was hands-on, new things and revelations were happening, I was going down blind tracks and coming back up again and I was using books. So It was a great journey of discovery so that was very memorable.\n\nI also had a very good English teacher and I love English literature. I had a very early introduction to poetry, because my mother, who was an English graduate, loved poetry and had a prodigious memory for poetry. She would walk around the house speaking poetry and so I learned a lot of poetry just by listening unconsciously.\n\nI can remember talking about the Lady of Shalott in a lesson, I had all the words in my head but it was my teacher who told me what they meant. Together we talked about why some words, when you put them together, mean more than their literal meaning, which is, of course, what poetry is. That was the lesson in which my home experience with my beloved mother and my school experience came together, and it was that coming together that was very revelatory. I loved poetry before and ever since.\n\nThe next 100 years\n\nThe next 100 years of Finnish education should\u2026 continue to do the things that Finland already does well. I don\u2019t think we can assume, that because something good is happening now, it will always happen. There are pressures such as economic pressures and technological pressures.\n\nThe thing that Finland does well, for me, is the contract that they have between the public and the schools. Education is very notably the Finnish national project. It\u2019s what they do absolutely brilliantly. Lying behind that is the trust between schools, parents and school principals, which is important to keep.\n\nSo the next 100 years of Finnish education must keep doing the things that they do so well, but it must also come to terms with the astonishing development of technology - and heaven knows what that will bring to us. I think there will be pressures to replace teachers and I think there is a very important job to be done reconciling the role of the teacher with the role of technology. Also, resisting economic pressures which will drive people towards replacing the teacher with technology, because it\u2019s cheaper that way and even in Finland it could happen.\n\nWe\u2019ve all got big challenges in understanding the role of technology in education and I think, as I\u2019ve said before, we need to look for the big positives that technology can bring to education such as more subtle assessment of the things that really matter to parents and to their children\u2019s futures. That isn\u2019t just about the things we normally assess now, so I think we\u2019ll see very powerful development in how we use computers for that.\n\nI think in the next 100 years in Finland, and everywhere else, we\u2019ll have a very fast growing understanding of how the brain works. Our understanding of neuroscience is in its infancy at the moment, but it\u2019s a very powerful and active field, and a lot of that is going to be relevant to education. We don\u2019t know what it is, but we need to resist fashions and believing myths that don\u2019t have any evidence in them, but rather be rigorously evidence-based. If we follow the evidence in schools, as neuroscientists understand more and more about how the brain works and how we learn, we will be able to take this understanding and improve the way that we teach young people.\n\nFor example, we are now beginning to learn things about the structure of the school day, about teenager\u2019s circadian rhythms and their optimum, about the optimum way of sequencing learning between initial learning and reinforcement, all these things to inspire positive learning. In the next 100 years we will understand a great deal more and be able to structure the school day more intelligently.\n\nThere will be many other things we will learn from neuroscience in the future that we must all embrace."}, {"url": "https://www.yorkscienceconference.com/john-holman", "page_content": "Professor Sir John Holman\n\nSir John Holman is an emeritus professor of chemistry at the University of York, a senior advisor in education at the Welcome Trust and the Gatsby Foundation, founding director of the National Science Learning Centre, Chair of the Teacher Development Trust and immediate past president of the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\n\u200b\n\nHe was named in 2014 by the Science Council as one of the UK's 100 leading practicing scientists, and was the 2014 recipient of the Royal Society's biennial Kavli Education Medal, \"in recognition of his significant impact on science education within the UK\".\n\nHe is author of the Good Career Guidance report for the Gastby Foundation, which is the basis for the English government's national strategy for career guidance in schools: Careers strategy: making the most of everyone's skills and talents."}, {"url": "https://royalsociety.org/fellows/", "page_content": "President\n\nSir Adrian Smith is President of the Royal Society.

This was the title Sir John Holman chose for his Royal Society Kavli Education Medal Lecture, delivered last week. It is a tantalising title, for it carries with it more than a hint of ambition and excitement. And Sir John\u2019s presentation was richly infused with both, though he didn\u2019t shy away from expressing a number of attendant concerns and fears.\n\nOf course, as Sir John acknowledged, there are so many unanswered questions in science education. But having considered the matter deeply and also consulted with various colleagues around the country, he had boiled down the many possibilities to ten, categorised under four headings: Teachers, Teaching, Curriculum and Assessment. All of these, he asserted, are required to ensure \u2018good\u2019 science education and, of these, teachers and teaching are the most important.\n\nSo here are Sir John\u2019s ten questions, in the considered order in which he presented them:\n\nTeachers\n\n1. What are the drivers that bring teachers into science teaching?\n\n- What keeps them in?\n\n2. How important are specialist subject qualifications for successful science teachers\n\nTeaching\n\n3. What difference does practical work make to science learning and progression?\n\n4. What can be learned from overseas about encouraging more girls into physics and engineering?\n\n5. How can the \u2018nature of science\u2019 be taught?\n\nCurriculum\n\n6. What do employers want from science education?\n\n7. What is the value of \u2018informal science learning\u2019?\n\n8. What is the value of teaching science in primary schools?\n\nAssessment\n\n9. What would exam questions look like if you designed them with learning as the goal?\n\n10. What conditions would be needed for the public to trust teacher assessment in high-stakes qualifications?\n\nThis list of questions merits serious consideration by education researchers, funders and policy-makers. It is a courageous list. It challenges the science (and wider STEM) community to seek new \u2013 and review the existing \u2013 evidence that demonstrates that science at any level is best taught by people who have specialist science and science-teaching qualifications. It also challenges the education and business communities to develop a shared understanding of each other\u2019s needs. Finally, it challenges policy-makers to take greater care in assessing international comparisons and to reconsider whether a high-stakes assessment system is really most conducive to young people\u2019s development and ensuring the country\u2019s economic prowess.\n\nAs Sir John observed, a number of these questions have either been asked, but not answered, or else they have been asked and unsatisfactorily answered. Several can reasonably be traced back to the introduction of the National Curriculum in 1989, which made science a core subject of study for all 5\u201316 year olds.\n\nSo why the lack of progress? Answering this question requires assessing the UK\u2019s capability to undertake the research required. Certainly there are doubts about this now. Quoting statistics from the latest Research Excellence Framework (REF) exercise, Sir John said that although 66% of education research staff submitted were adjudged to be \u2018world-leading\u2019 or \u2018internationally excellent\u2019, only 27% of eligible researchers had actually been submitted to the REF. The picture for science education research appears to be bleaker still, with the supply of new researchers having almost dried up. New ways, he said, need to be found to energise education research, including drawing more on the expertise of, for instance, neuroscientists and psychologists.\n\nSir John is an inveterate optimist and, in an upbeat finale, he called on the science community to continue to be ambitious about improving science education, to be inspired by the aspirations of the Royal Society\u2019s Vision for science and mathematics education and take seriously the Government\u2019s Election manifesto pledge \u2018to make Britain the best place in the world to study maths, science and engineering\u2019. He ended with these uplifting words from the poet Robert Browning:\n\n\u2018Ah, but a man\u2019s reach should exceed his grasp,\n\n\n\nOr what\u2019s a heaven for?\u2019"}, {"url": "https://royalsociety.org/about-us/history/", "page_content": "The story of the Royal Society is the story of modern science.\n\nOur origins lie in a 1660 \u2018invisible college\u2019 of natural philosophers and physicians. Today we are the UK\u2019s national science academy and a Fellowship of some 1,600 of the world\u2019s most eminent scientists.\n\nNullius in verba\n\nThe very first \u2018learned society\u2019 meeting on 28 November 1660 followed a lecture at Gresham College by Christopher Wren. Joined by other leading polymaths including Robert Boyle and John Wilkins, the group soon received royal approval, and from 1663 it would be known as 'The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge'.\n\nThe Royal Society's motto 'Nullius in verba' is taken to mean 'take nobody's word for it'. It is an expression of the determination of Fellows to withstand the domination of authority and to verify all statements by an appeal to facts determined by experiment.\n\nAdvancements and adventure\n\nThe early years of the Society saw revolutionary advancements in the conduct and communication of science. Hooke\u2019s Micrographia and the first issue of Philosophical Transactions were published in 1665 alone. Philosophical Transactions, which established the important concepts of scientific priority and peer review, is now the oldest continuously-published science journal in the world.\n\nWe published Isaac Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica, and Benjamin Franklin\u2019s kite experiment demonstrating the electrical nature of lightning. We backed James Cook\u2019s journey to Tahiti, reaching Australia and New Zealand, to track the Transit of Venus. We published the first report in English of inoculation against disease, approved Charles Babbage\u2019s Difference Engine, documented the eruption of Krakatoa and published Chadwick\u2019s detection of the neutron that would lead to the unleashing of the atom.\n\nThe leading scientific lights of the past four centuries can all be found among the 8,000 Fellows elected to the Society to date. From Newton to Darwin to Einstein, Hawking and beyond, pioneers and paragons in their fields are elected by their peers. Current Fellows include Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Sophie Wilson and Tim Berners-Lee.\n\nIndependence\n\nOver time, the criteria for, and transparency of election to the Fellowship became stricter, and Fellows were elected solely on the merit of their scientific work. The first female Fellows were elected in 1945 \u2013 Dorothy Hodgkin, elected in 1947, remains Britain\u2019s only female Nobel Prize-winning scientist.\n\nIn the 19th century, a Parliamentary Grant system was introduced, allowing the Society to aid scientific development while remaining an independent body.

He is better known today for adding two elements to the periodic table, chlorine and iodine, and for inventing a safety lamp for miners. In 1820, he became President of England's premier scientific organization, The Royal Society. In 1869 the Davy Medal was established under the will of his brother, Dr. John Davy, F.R.S. Since 1877, the Davy Medal and a monetary prize have been given annually by The Royal Society \"for an outstandingly important discovery in any branch of chemistry.\" In 1926, this example of the medal was awarded to Sir James Walker (1863-1935) for his work on the theory of ionization.\n\nIn 1800 the British chemist, Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829) published his meticulous research on nitrous oxide (N2O), also known as laughing gas. Davy's experiments had included inhaling the gas and observing his own reactions. He noted that it eased the pain of his toothache, and suggested that it might be used to relieve surgical pain. Although his book was widely praised, the idea of inhalation anesthesia was not immediately embraced. Another 44 years passed before the American dentist Horace Wells tested nitrous oxide's capacity to diminish pain by having one of his own teeth extracted while under the effects of the gas.\n\nCatalog Record: Davy Medal\n\nAccess Key: aknr\n\nAccession No.: 2004-09-07-1\n\nTitle: [Davy Medal] / A.

He became Private 180847 of the 88th Battalion. After sailing to England in June 1916 under the command of Lieutenant Colonel H J R Cullin, the battalion was absorbed into the 30th Reserve Battalion at East Sandling, Kent on 18 July 1916. Four weeks later Private 180847 was part of a draft sent to France as reinforcements for the 47th Battalion.\n\n\n\nJohn joined his new unit in billets at Nordes Que commune. The battalion then travelled by train and foot to Warloy, Somme and the trenches at Tara Hill. They alternated between time in the trenches and in the reserve brigade. By the middle of November 1916, they were at Regina Trench and it was here that John was wounded in the neck and spent eight days in No 29 Casualty Clearing Station before returning to duty at the end of the month.

His research confirmed the decline of the ozone layer in the Arctic and over populated latitudes in the northern hemisphere.\n\nIt has also showed that since the Protocol was introduced, the ozone layer has started to recover. A healthier ozone layer means that by 2030, there will be some two million fewer cases of skin cancer each year.\n\nJohn says: \u201cI am very pleased and honoured to receive such a prestigious award.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cThe Montreal Protocol demonstrates that international action \u2013 supported by fundamental science and technology and by policy, backed up by appropriate funding initiatives \u2013 can successfully address a global environmental problem.\u201d\n\nJohn is Chief Scientist at the UK\u2019s National Centre for Atmospheric Science.

Mr. Kearns will sing at Dr. Holman\u2019s memorial service at 1 p.m. Thursday, May 23, at Lovers Lane United Methodist Church. Dr. Holman was a member of the Lovers Lane choir for 50 years, and recorded and photographed many of the performances at the church for their archives.\n\nDr. Holman retired from SMU as Brown Foundation Professor of Mechanical Engineering in 2005 after a 45-year teaching career on the Hilltop, where he regularly won outstanding teaching awards. He also served terms as head of SMU\u2019s department of civil and mechanical engineering and as assistant provost for instructional media. He was voted outstanding faculty member by the student body 13 times, and had the honor of having the Mechanical Engineering Department Complex named for him.\n\n\u201cProfessor Holman literally wrote the book(s) on heat transfer, experimental methods, and thermodynamics,\u201d said Marc Christensen, dean of SMU\u2019s Bobby B. Lyle School of Engineering. \u201cOver the years, alumni returning to campus have fondly remembered Professor Holman\u2019s lectures and advice. He made a tremendous impact on so many lives. He is a major part of the legacy at SMU Lyle and will be greatly missed.\u201d\n\nDr. Holman was born in Dallas July 11, 1934 and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1951. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering at SMU in 1955 and his Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering, also from SMU, in 1956. He earned his Ph.D. at Oklahoma State University in 1958 and spent two years of active duty as a research scientist in the Air Force Aerospace Research Laboratory before joining SMU as associate professor of mechanical engineering in 1960. He began earning professional recognition almost immediately, receiving the Mechanical Engineer of the Year award from the North Texas Section of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1961.\n\nDr. Holman published over 30 papers and was the author of three widely used textbooks: Heat Transfer, first published in 1963, Experimental Methods for Engineers, first published in 1966, and Thermodynamics, first published in 1969. All were published by McGraw-Hill, have been reprinted multiple times and have been translated into at least six languages. He also is the author of the utilitarian monograph What Every Engineer Should Know About EXCEL (2006) published by CRC Press.\n\nA member of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), Dr. Holman was past Chairman of the National Mechanical Engineering Division. He was a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and past Chairman of the ASME Region X Mechanical Engineering Department Heads.\n\n\u201cHe was such a giant in the field of thermodynamics and heat transfer,\u201d said Bijan Mohraz, professor of environmental and civil engineering in SMU\u2019s Lyle School. \u201cHe was one of those who had a knack for taking the most difficult subjects and writing them in a very clear and concise manner. As a result of that, his books were very popular. At one time, the book on heat transfer was being used in over 130 universities throughout the United States.\u201d\n\nDr. Holman was a prolific researcher, serving as principal investigator for research sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission, the National Science Foundation, NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency. He also conducted research for the Strategic Defense Initiative \u2013 the Ronald Reagan-era program known as \u201cStar Wars.\u201d\n\nOver the course of his career, Dr. Holman won some of the most prestigious national awards available to members of his profession, including the George Westinghouse Award from the American Society of Engineering Education in 1972; the James Harry Potter Gold Medal, awarded by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1986; and the Worcester Reed Warner Gold Medal, the distinguished literature award of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, in 1987. In 1993, Dr. Holman was the recipient of the Lohmann Medal from Oklahoma State University, which is awarded annually to a distinguished engineering alumnus. In 1995, Dr. Holman received the Ralph Coats Roe Award as the outstanding mechanical engineering educator of the year from the American Society for Engineering Education.\n\nDr. Holman is survived by his wife, Katherine; his son, Blake Holman, and daughter-in-law, Joan Holman; his daughter, Bevin Holman Lonngren, and son-in-law, Kent Lonngren; and his grandchildren John Holman, Emma Lonngren, and Lawrence Lonngren.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, Dr. Holman\u2019s family requests that memorials be made to the Dallas Area Parkinsonism Society, 6370 LBJ Freeway #176, Dallas, TX, 75220 or at http://www.daps.us/; to the Lovers Lane Sanctuary Choir Fund, 9200 Inwood Road, Dallas, TX 75220; to the Jack P. and Katherine K.
