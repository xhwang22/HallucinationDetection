Over the course of their almost five decades of music making, the band has produced eight gold albums, three sextuple-platinum albums, and one platinum album, just to name a few of their accomplishments. Kansas will bring their Point of Know Return Tour to the People\u2019s Bank Theatre for two dates later this month, and tickets are still available for the Saturday, November 20 show.\n\n\u201cPoint of Know Return,\u201d which the band will play in its entirety throughout the tour, is an album and a cultural landmark. After all, what screams \u201ccultural landmark\u201d like being a music reference in the 2000, John Cusack-starring film \u201cHigh Fidelity\u201d?\n\nIn the film (and maybe in the 1995 Nick Hornby novel the film is based on, but this music journalist can\u2019t say for sure because I haven\u2019t read that \u2014 yet) Championship Vinyl employee Barry Judd (played by Jack Black,) refers to \u201cPoint Of Know Return\u201d as one of the most obvious selections for being the LP with the \u201cbest side one, song one in the history of pop music.\u201d\n\nI was given the opportunity to speak with Rich Williams, the band\u2019s guitarist, about Kansas\u2019 cultural endurance, how unlikely rock stardom seemed when the group was just starting out, and what audiences can look forward to at the band\u2019s shows at the Peoples Bank Theater later this month."}, {"url": "https://rockcellarmagazine.com/kansas-band-interview-rich-williams-point-of-know-return-live/", "page_content": "Facebook Twitter Email Reddit\n\nIt is sad to report that Kansas founder and violinist Robby Steinhardt has passed away. Steinhardt was the original violinist and vocalist on \u201cDust in the Wind,\u201d \u201cPoint of No Return\u201d and \u201cCarry on Wayward Son.\u201d Steinhardt, who was working on a solo album, was 71. The following interview with guitarist Rich Williams was conducted May 14, 2021.\n\nClassic rock bands have always experienced a revolving door of musicians. Kansas has seen its share of upheaval, but guitarist Rich Williams and drummer Phil Ehart have been with the band since its debut album. \u201cWe have a work ethic that we get from our parents and from where we grew up of just sticking to it,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThings get tough, you stick with it.\u201d\n\nAfter years of false starts, the band signed with producer Don Kirshner\u2019s label and released Kansas in 1974. Its mix of progressive rock and symphonic arrangements with the work of violinist Robby Steinhardt produced the band\u2019s signature sound \u2014 a sound that has allowed the group to still maintain a steady presence today.\n\nThe band\u2019s breakout LP was 1976\u2019s Leftoverture, which featured the hit single \u201cCarry On Wayward Son.\u201d Point of Know Return followed in 1977. The success of the title track and \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d secured the band\u2019s spot as a major arena headliner.\n\nIn July 2020, Kansas released its 16th studio album, The Absence of Presence. The album introduced the band\u2019s newest member, Tom Breslin, a vocalist who contributed music and lyrics.\n\nKansas in concert delivers performances that remain true to the original studio cuts. In 2016\u20132017 Kansas launched the Leftoverture 40th Anniversary Tour, which became the 2017 live album Leftoverture Live & Beyond. Kansas followed with its Point of Know Return Anniversary Tour. The band recorded every show and on May 28, 2021, released Point of Know Return Live & Beyond.\n\nClick here to pick up Point Of Know Return Live & Beyond on 2-CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\nClick here to pick up Point Of Know Return Live & Beyond on 3-LP/2-CD from our Rock Cellar Store\n\n\u201cWe thought maybe one day we would release this,\u201d says Williams. \u201cAnd then with the pandemic, we figured, \u2018we have the time, let\u2019s put this together.\u2019\u201d\n\nRock Cellar talked with the guitarist shortly before the live album\u2019s release, and it was made evident that decades of success have not changed his intensity and work ethic.\n\nWilliams explains how the band\u2019s music \u2014 and members \u2014 evolved over more than four decades. It\u2019s an object lesson that every musician should read before putting pen to contract.\n\nRock Cellar: Why was Point of No Return the focus of the new live album?\n\nRich Williams: We had previously released the Leftoverture Live & Beyond album. To have a recording done in its entirety, in its original running order, it had never been done. Until this tour, we\u2019d never played all these songs ever. It also gave us the opportunity to go deeper into a lot of other albums. Like \u201cLonely Wind,\u201d we hadn\u2019t played it forever. If we played it, we didn\u2019t play it for long. To bring certain songs back from the dead was just smart to do.\n\nWe recorded every night from out front, so we probably had 100 shows taped. That process becomes a lot easier, it\u2019s almost like a studio at that point. You\u2019ve got everything mic\u2019d just right.\n\nRock Cellar: Kansas recently played its first live show in 14 months. What went into preparing for the show after such a long layoff?\n\nRich Williams: As far as the group, we showed up, we did the show. But fortunately we have the live album. And almost everything we\u2019re playing at the moment comes off of that album. So we just compiled the setlist and then a playlist and everybody just did their homework.\n\nFor the last two months I\u2019ve played that set twice a day. At home, I have the same setup as my live setup. So I can just stand there and go through all the motions of what I have to do and play along with the same guys, just through my studio speakers.\n\nThat\u2019s really what everybody did. We just continued doing the show. We had a real brief hotel room rehearsal the night before. And then we jumped on stage and did it. The weirdest part was walking out on stage. It\u2019s like another day. It didn\u2019t seem like that much time had passed. The lights went on and we did the show.\n\nWe were just glad to see each other. That part was exciting, but everybody was very prepared. There was a bit of adrenaline, some nerves, it\u2019s like, \u201chow\u2019s this going to go?\u201d Normally, if we\u2019re on the road, and we go three weeks without shows, one of us will put together a rehearsal. We probably won\u2019t do that anymore now because we know we can do it without that. It\u2019s six responsible guys that kept up on it.\n\nRock Cellar: How do you approach improvisation when performing live, especially on the best-known songs?\n\nRich Williams: For me, there are certain things I want to play not quite note-for-note, but I stick to the theme at least. There are other things I just don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, \u201chere comes a part, what are you going to play?\u201d I don\u2019t know. Then I just start playing.\n\nI\u2019m just going to play in the moment, kind of the way I do it in the studio. I hate to over-rehearse. What moves me at the moment is what I usually tend to go for. There\u2019s been so many times where, in the studio, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to play here. Just roll the tape.\u201d\n\nFor example, in the song \u201cThe Voyage of Eight Eighteen\u201d on The Prelude Implicit, I had no idea what I was going to play in the solo. I just knew I wanted to get this big, out of control-kind of a sound. Usually, I record in the control room but for this I went out and had the amp right next to me, just crankin\u2019. I said, \u201cjust run it by, let me get a feel for this.\u201d\n\nSo it went by, I was just kind of holding on, I didn\u2019t know what I was gonna do exactly. And they said, \u201cyou\u2019re done.\u201d I said, \u201cwhat?\u201d That was great.\n\nI had no idea what I was doing whatsoever. I was just trying to get a feel for where the feedback points were and just get a general feel of it all. And it\u2019s one of my favorite things I\u2019ve ever done. That\u2019s my approach to a lot of solos. \u201cI have no idea, here it comes.\u201d It\u2019s the shotgun approach. I just aim it in the general direction and pull the trigger and see what happens.\n\nKANSAS will be extending the popular Point of Know Return Tour starting with new shows starting November 13, 2021. Before that, the band will be performing sets of KANSAS Classics later this summer & early fall.

It\u2019s one thing to sit down and practice it but then you\u2019ve got the lights and the crowd and so many distractions. To keep a constant focus on what you\u2019re doing [can be tough], because if your mind wanders, you\u2019re in the weeds really quickly. It\u2019s mentally exhausting staying focused. But then on the other hand, there are some simpler songs that my mind will tend to wander and I will get lost. It\u2019s like, pay attention! It\u2019s funny how that works.\n\nMany bands of our era sit around and party before they go out and get half drunk and go out. We just have too much to do. There\u2019s no way to do that and go out there and play. It\u2019s too hard.\n\nRock Cellar: You\u2019ve said that the success of Leftoverture and Point of Know Return changed the internal workings of the band. What did you mean?\n\nRich Williams: When we first started, we were young men. It\u2019s not like we were from poor families, but leaving home, we all played in different bar bands, some together, some with other people, you\u2019re not successful in any way. People living in band houses, you have kind of an all-for-one, one-for-all, you\u2019re like pirates out on the open sea. It\u2019s teamwork. And it goes like that. And time goes on.\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t a complaint, it\u2019s an observation. It\u2019s just the way things go.\n\nThe way the money works with records, etc. is we did not sign a good deal with Don Kirshner. He was our benefactor, it was the only offer we got. Without him, nothing would have ever happened. But the first thing he did was say, \u201cI am a publisher. I want to publish or go somewhere else.\u201d So right away, we threw a third of the pie away. Another third of the pie is writer\u2019s royalties. And the last part of it is the royalties that the band would bank.\n\nThat part has to pay for every possible recording cost of everything. It takes a long time to pay off recording debts. So no money comes to the band. But the songwriters, and rightfully so, they get paid from the first record sold. They get money from that. So after Leftoverture went gold, we paid off all of our previous debt. The songwriters had already made a small fortune. That starts to change the dynamic.\n\nAt that point in the band, we\u2019re getting a little older, we\u2019ve been together for a while, people are buying houses, cars, getting married. So that all-for-one, one-for-all mentality has taken its natural course and starts to change the dynamic within the band.\n\nThen Point of Know Return, some people have made a lot of money and they don\u2019t want to work as much. Others are, \u201cI\u2019d like to get mine now.\u201d So things just changed. People were going from young, dumb guys to maturing a bit.\n\nAnd money does change people. So people will wander in all sorts of directions.\n\nThings just take their natural course. People naturally drifted apart because it wasn\u2019t really working anymore. But we\u2019re all good friends to this day. No animosity towards anybody through all of that.\n\nThat\u2019s just the dynamic of what happens within a band that\u2019s been around for a little while.\n\nRock Cellar: How do you maintain the classic Kansas sound despite so many personnel changes?\n\nRich Williams: For the first album, everyone was involved in arranging things, in editing things, saying this works, this doesn\u2019t work. Identifying what we\u2019re comfortable with, what parts we like, which parts we don\u2019t. My input is recognizing what fits within a quintessential Kansas part. Or what can we do to this to make it more Kansas-esque? I just have an ear for that.\n\nWe\u2019ve surrounded ourselves with people who have done it for quite a while with us, people who came in very familiar.\n\nWe know who we are and we know who we were and what we want to continue to be, so it\u2019s really not that difficult. Tom Breslin, the newest addition, brought in a lot of material and it wasn\u2019t difficult for us to turn this into what sounds like Kansas.\n\nRock Cellar: The title, The Absence of Presence, is a reference of modern technology?\n\nRich Williams: Yes, but it\u2019s a bit ambiguous. It tends to mean different things to different people. I like things that are ambiguous. The original concept of it was people are so out of touch with what\u2019s around because of the technology in their hand or what they\u2019re watching or computers, whatever.\n\nRock Cellar: The album continues the use of the band\u2019s trademark violin. Explain the violin\u2019s importance in the Kansas sound.\n\nRich Williams: We did a couple of albums, Steve Morse on guitar [Power and In the Spirit of Things], good albums but they sound like a different band. They just do. It is a signature sound, it does set us apart. I think it made us do something. What that is is the violinist needs something to do besides stand around and play fiddle parts. It changes my parts, it changes keyboard parts, because suddenly you find yourself in more of an orchestral sense.\n\nIt creates a more symphonic sound. If you take the violin away, all of a sudden the guitarist is just flashing, the keyboards are just playing away. You add that other dimension and suddenly you become more artistic in your approach.\n\nRock Cellar: You and Phil have been together since the first album. What\u2019s the secret of your longevity together?\n\nRich Williams: The top of the list would be tenacity. We grew up in the Midwest, family life. My dad met my mother in England during World War II. They married and remained married until their death. He had a job at a place called Baker Truck Rental before the war. He came back, Baker Truck Rental became Ryder Truck Rental. He remained with them until he retired. Phil\u2019s dad, he was a colonel in the Air Force. They travelled all over the world. His family life was very similar. He had one job, married until their death.\n\nWhat I learned was that sticking to a commitment is in my nature by birth and by example. We have a work ethic that we get from our parents and from where we grew up of just sticking to it. Things get tough, you stick with it. Things get good, you stick with it. I started at a certain age to take the next step: when something shitty happens, OK, fine, fuck it. Next step. I\u2019ve never quit anything. So that part isn\u2019t an effort. It\u2019s my nature.\n\nPeople ask, when are you going to retire, Rich? I go, what would you have me do? Play more golf? Stamp collecting? I\u2019ve got the best job on earth. And someone says, what do you do in your spare time? I practice. I\u2019ve got a guitar room with 30 guitars in it, a wall of amplifiers and my computer is all set up so I can prepare for the next show. That\u2019s what I do. And that\u2019s true for both of us.\n\nWe talked about it recently. It comes up once in awhile, after the pandemic especially. It\u2019s like, what do you think? Hey, I\u2019m in. Good, I\u2019m glad to hear that \u2019cause I am too. We will do this until we can\u2019t. Because we love to do it.\n\nRock Cellar: Let\u2019s do a Lightning Round. A Kansas song more people should have listened to.\n\nRich Williams: \u201cThe Voyage of Eight Eighteen.\u201d\n\nRock Cellar: What would be a great song for Kansas to cover?\n\nRich Williams: We have done some in the past. We did \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d with the London Symphony Orchestra. We did \u201cBringing It Back\u201d by J. J. Cale on the first album. A song that I always thought we\u2019d do great is \u201cSolsbury Hill\u201d by Peter Gabriel.\n\nRock Cellar: Favorite guitarist.\n\nRich Williams: Jeff Beck.\n\nRock Cellar: If you weren\u2019t in Kansas, what band, past or present, do you think you would have been a good fit for?\n\nRich Williams: AC/DC."}, {"url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/fellow-kansas-member-rich-williams-called-guitar-wizard.html/", "page_content": "Kansas guitarist Rich Williams joined the band known for its rotating roster in 1972. He\u2019s one of the few among his bandmates to stick around since the early days, ensuring he crossed paths with dozens of incredible musicians over the decades. As it turns out, a particular music legend stuck out more than others.\n\nRich Williams called working with Steve Morse \u2018terrifying\u2019\n\nRich Williams | Scott Dudelson/Getty Images\n\nRenowned guitarist Steve Morse joined Kansas in the mid-\u201980s, which Williams recently admitted intimidated him. In an interview with Guitar World, he recalled what it was like working with the Morse on Power, the band\u2019s first album to feature them both.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started rehearsing in Phil [Ehart] \u2018s basement, I was sitting down with Steve, and he had just been awarded the best guitar player ever for the third year in a row and was now in the Hall of Fame. And here I am, in a room with him, and we\u2019re creating material together. For me, that was a terrifying experience until I got to know what Steve was like. He\u2019s the least threatening and intimidating guy you could ever meet. He\u2019s a guitar wizard.\u201d\n\nEven though Morse only played with the band for three years, his influence was profound.\n\nSteve Morse was always learning\n\nDespite being labeled the best guitarist in the world, Morse never stopped looking out for new techniques or strategies. In the same interview, Williams shared a story from when he toured with Morse and learned a valuable lesson from his bandmate.\n\n\u201cWe were on the road somewhere, had just done a show, and walked into the hotel lobby, and there was this crappy band playing in the lounge. I was about to make a joke about it when Steve turned to me and said, \u2018Did you see what the guitar player just did there?\u2019 It was something that the player did with his toggle switch. Steve said he had never seen anybody do it that way before. I thought, \u2018He is the best guitar player in the world, and he is still always learning.\u2019 He was looking for something that was different, like this kid did in that band. And I thought that, as a guitar player, it was such a great mindset to have.\u201d\n\nHappy Birthday Richard Williams!!\n\n\n\nPhoto Credit \u2013 Mark Schierholz pic.twitter.com/nse25DaAih \u2014 KANSAS (@KansasBand) February 1, 2023\n\nMusicians rotated in and out of Kansas\n\nOther than Williams and Ehart, the members of Kansas frequently changed since it first formed in the \u201970s. According to Musician Guide, most of the original members knew each other from high school. Don Montre, Kerry Livgren, Lynn Meredith, Dan Wright, Scott Kessler, and Zeke Lowe first performed as Saratoga before merging with White Clover.\n\nThey changed the band\u2019s name to Kansas when White Clover members Dave Hope and Phil Ehart joined. Unfortunately, the band\u2019s initial attempt wasn\u2019t successful. By 1971, Ehart, Hope, and others left to reform White Clover.\n\nThis pattern repeated several more times before Kansas maintained a consistent roster and released its self-titled debut album in 1974. The band had a cult following in the early days and reached true stardom after they released their fourth album Leftoverture in 1976. Fifty years later, they still tour regularly.\n\nRich Williams never imaged Kansas would still tour 50 years later\n\nEven though it\u2019s common for young people to dream big, Williams admitted he didn\u2019t think Kansas would still tour so many years later. In fact, he thought he would have bought a bar by now for him and his friends to jam at!\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of perpetually toured, but we never would have imagined we\u2019d get 50 years,\u201d he told Guitar World. \u201cWe thought we might get four or five good years, and then I would go back to Kansas and maybe buy a bar, have a little stage there, and play with my friends. But it just kept going.\u201d\n\nWhile owning a bar is a respectable backup plan, music lovers are grateful Kansas is still performing live!"}, {"url": "https://www.guitarworld.com/features/richard-williams-not-to-sound-pompous-but-kansas-pretty-much-gave-birth-to-american-prog-bands", "page_content": "Mention the band Kansas to the average listener, and he or she will instantly name two classic rock staples: Carry On Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind.\n\n\u201cOh, sure, those are the big ones,\u201d says guitarist Richard Williams, who co-founded the progressive rock outfit back in 1970. \u201cI could let it get to me and go, \u2018Hey, we\u2019ve got a whole body of work,\u2019 but that would be a waste of time. Those are the songs that brought us to the table. Without Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind, we wouldn\u2019t be around today.\u201d\n\nWilliams recalls how in 1976, with the band deep in debt to their record label and facing an uncertain future after their first three albums (Kansas, Song for America and Masque) stiffed, they approached the recording of their fourth album, Leftoverture, with a sense of impending doom.\n\n\u201cIt was a pretty dark time. We were bleeding money pretty seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were signed to Kirshner Records, and our benefactor, Don Kirshner, could have easily said, \u2018Guys, it\u2019s been fun, but you need to find another record company.\u2019 We needed a hit, and thank goodness we came up with Carry On Wayward Son. It saved us so we could go on. And then we had Dust in the Wind. Those songs exploded and our worlds changed forever.\u201d\n\nKansas were in a unique position in the mid Seventies. Not only did they represent the last trace of progressive rock on AM playlists that were suddenly ruled by disco, but they were also one of the very few purveyors of American prog, period.\n\n\u201cNot to sound pompous, but we pretty much gave birth to American prog bands,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is, we did it pretty sneakily. We were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019d slip in one of our own tunes and tell the crowd that we were playing the B-side of Smoke on the Water. We\u2019d stretch songs out and go crazy, and the people loved it. It became our thing.\u201d\n\nWe were playing bars in Topeka, doing all the hits of the day \u2013 Motown, the British Invasion, all that \u2013 but we really wanted to do our own material\n\nOf the seven current members of Kansas, only Williams and drummer Phil Ehart remain from the original crew. Singer Steve Walsh, who ended his on-and-off association with the band in 2014, has been replaced by two co-lead vocalists, Billy Greer and Ronnie Platt, who double on bass and keyboards, respectively.\n\nWilliams\u2019 longtime guitar foil Kerry Livgren, who also served as Kansas\u2019 chief songwriter, split in 2000, and in his place is New Jersey picker Zak Rizvi.\n\n(Image credit: Paul Natkin/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cIt feels like a different band sometimes because we\u2019ve got a bunch of newer faces,\u201d Williams says, \u201cbut at the same time, it feels like the original band because we\u2019ve got seven guys who really love to perform and create. Back in the day, we let money and business get in the way. This bunch of guys just wants to make music.\u201d\n\nThe band has a new album out, 2020\u2019s The Absence of Presence, and all told, it sounds like quintessential Kansas: there\u2019s muscular, epic prog-rockers like Throwing Mountains and the eight-minute-plus title track, symphonic power ballads such as Jets Overhead and Memories Down the Line, and there\u2019s even a \u201chow-over-the-top-can-we-go?\u201d instrumental in the form of Propulsion 1.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re kind of always in a state of having to prove ourselves,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe had to do it on our last album, [2016\u2019s] The Prelude Implicit, because it was our first new music in 16 years, and I think this time we had to prove that we still mean it.\u201d\n\nHe lets out a laugh, then adds, \u201cI imagine on the next one, we\u2019ll have to do the same thing. That\u2019s OK \u2013 I\u2019m used to it.\u201d\n\nBefore the band got started, who were the guitar players that you were really listening to and emulating?\n\n\u201cI was copying anybody who was there. The Yardbirds were pretty big to me. My introduction to blues wasn\u2019t through the Americans; I dug the British guys. John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton \u2013 Clapton\u2019s first solo album was like Guitar 101 to me.\n\n\u201cInstead of this twangy rhythmic instrument, suddenly here\u2019s this ballsy guitar with a guttural saxophone lead voice. Suddenly, I was hearing blues in a different way. Of course, I also loved Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck \u2013 those guys made a big impression on me. That stuff really formed the basis of my sound and style.\u201c\n\nGrowing up in Topeka, was it easy for you to get good guitars living where you were?\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I had Marshall amps and Les Pauls. I had a Gibson ES-335, which I still have to this day. Everything that you could buy in Los Angeles you could buy in Topeka. When I was 15, I had a charge account at the local music store. If I wanted something, I\u2019d charge it and make weekly payments on it.\n\n\u201cThis was a pretty cool time. When The Beatles were on Ed Sullivan\u2019s show, Topeka exploded, just like every other town in the country. Everybody had to be in a band. There was a garage band on every block.\u201c\n\nKansas played covers in clubs for a few years. Do you remember when you first heard prog from England and when it started to influence the band?\n\n\u201cIt took a while. For a time it seemed as if only the two coasts were hearing the prog stuff. Gradually the stations in Kansas started playing it \u2013 I guess somebody\u2019s ears were tuned to it. We\u2019d be like, 'Wow, have you heard this band called ELP?' Or 'Have you heard Genesis\u2019 Selling England by the Pound?'\n\n\u201cIt was very exciting to find all these new, creative ways of addressing rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. I don\u2019t even know if 'rock \u2018n\u2019 roll' was the correct term for that music.\u201c\n\nSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it... We cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different\n\nEven so, it didn\u2019t seem as if American bands were jumping on the prog bandwagon. You guys were outliers.\n\n\u201cSome bands were resistant to chance, but we embraced it. I mean, we played Mitch Ryder & the Detroit Wheels-type stuff; we cut our teeth on rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. But we were looking to be different. I remember playing cover songs during our club days. You\u2019d get to a part and be like, 'Man, this song sucks. I hate the middle part.'\n\n\u201cSo we started thinking that we could do some sort of interlude at the beginning, or maybe we could play the song at half-time. We did anything to change it up and put some balls to the music. In hindsight, we were doing something very important: We were learning how to be us.\u201c\n\n(Image credit: Dimitri Hakke/Redferns)\n\nDid it seem as if playing throughout your home state was a dead end? Did the band consider relocating to one of the two coasts to get noticed?\n\n\u201cWell, what happened was, we made a demo tape, and that\u2019s what we sent out to the coasts. One of them wound up on Don Kirshner\u2019s desk. The people at Don\u2019s company loved it \u2013 they really dug the violin \u2013 and they sent a guy named Wally Gold to check us out.\n\n\u201cWe put together a show and did that old free-beer trick: 'Come to the show and the drinks are free.' So Wally showed up and the place was packed; everybody was drunk and partying. So Wally called Don and said, 'Man, there\u2019s something going on here. People are crawling through the windows to get in the place.' That sealed the deal. Next thing you know, we signed a deal with Don Kirshner and were making records.\u201c\n\nLeftoverture [1976] and Point of Know Return [1977] hit one after the other. After being hitless for several years, that must have felt remarkable.\n\n\u201dI\u2019m still here today doing this because of that explosion. We didn\u2019t really know how huge it was at the time. We were just blue-collar guys from the Midwest. I remember arriving at Madison Square Garden in a limo with our manager, and he was going, 'Madison Square Garden! This is so big!'\n\n\u201dWe were like, 'Yeah, yeah, whatever.' We\u2019d been on the road for so long, so to us this was just a natural progression of more and more shows. Today I realize how big it was, but back then we didn\u2019t really see it.\u201d\n\nHow much of Carry On Wayward Son had Kerry written before the band got to dive into it? And how long did it take to work out that intricate guitar and keyboard solo section?\n\n\u201cThat was the last song we did for the album, on the final day or recording. Kerry came in and said he had a new song. We learned the structure of it and got to it. The version you hear on the record is probably the first time we ever played it correctly.\n\n\u201cThe solo thing didn\u2019t take long. My approach to guitar is just wing it. I didn\u2019t really have a planned solo. I just responded to what everybody else was doing and threw stuff out there. I was kind of like, 'I\u2019ll just play stuff. Let me know if it sounds right.'\u201c\n\nFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression\n\nThe acoustic guitar figure of Dust in the Wind is so recognizable. I understand that Kerry wrote it as a fingerpicking exercise.\n\n\u201cYeah, Kerry didn\u2019t write the song to write a song; he wrote this chord pattern to teach himself fingerstyle guitar. His wife thought it was a song, and he was like, 'No, this isn\u2019t Kansas. The band would never play this.' But he brought it in and we thought it was really nice.\n\n\u201cThe figure was there; it didn\u2019t have the middle section or the violin solo. But it came together fast. I remember when we were listening back to it, somebody said, 'That\u2019s the next single.' Kerry didn\u2019t think so, but the rest of us knew. And sure enough \u2013 boom. The track exploded on the radio.\u201c\n\nThe way you approached the solo section of Wayward Son \u2013 is that still the way you compose leads in the studio? I\u2019m thinking of the title track of the new album, which has a similar solo structure.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of the same. What happens is, somebody lays something down and everybody else plays off of it. It\u2019s very collaborative, but not as instant as it was back in the day. Somebody else\u2019s solo will dictate what you\u2019re going to do, and you take inspiration from what they\u2019ve done to go somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always fun to do it that way. I\u2019ll lay down the foundation, and then Zak will play something; Tom will do a smoking keyboard part. Sometimes we redo our parts based on what somebody does.\u201c\n\nThe riff in the song Throwing Mountains sounds as tough and mean as early grunge. Did any of that stuff ever make an impression on you?\n\n\u201dNot really at first. I could appreciate the honesty of grunge. It\u2019s like, I loved The Beatles for their polish, but I loved The Rolling Stones for their rawness. You listen to Bob Dylan \u2013 his recordings are very elementary, but they\u2019re honest.\n\n\u201dFor rock, it\u2019s always best if it\u2019s not perfect. You need an edge to it. I think that\u2019s one thing about Kansas that\u2019s always been cool \u2013 we have that aggression. So you mention grunge and that song, sure, I\u2019ll take that. It reminds me of how punk obliterated disco back in the day. Let\u2019s get back to being raw.\u201d\n\nHow are you enjoying playing live with Zak Rizvi?\n\n\u201dOh, I\u2019m loving it. Zak has a deep love and knowledge of the band. He\u2019s a tremendous engineer and guitarist \u2013 just brilliant musically. He\u2019s a real scholar of music. Playing with him and having him in the band is great. There isn\u2019t much he can\u2019t play. I mean, he played trombone in a symphony. I have a blast working with him.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like working with Steve Morse during his time in the band?\n\n\u201dWhat an interesting guy! When he came in, he had just won every guitar award imaginable; they had to invent awards to give him. I\u2019ll be honest: I was a little intimidated at first, but I was pleased to find out that he\u2019s the least intimidating man around. He\u2019s fascinated by everything.\n\n\u201dWe would be on tour, and we would see some crappy band playing at a Holiday Inn or wherever. We would be like, 'Let\u2019s go. This band sucks.' But Steve would say, 'Did you see what that guitar player just did with his on/off switch?' The guitarist wasn\u2019t even that good, but Steve was learning from him anyway.\u201d\n\n\ufeffFor a while you played PRS guitars, but I understand you\u2019ve moved back to Les Pauls now.\n\n\u201dI still play PRS guitars occasionally, but I got my hands on a Les Paul that blew me away. It\u2019s one of the Lee Roy Parnell signature models \u2013 a reissue of the \u201957 Goldtop \u2013 and it\u2019s fabulous.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s got a support in the back of the headstock, so if it falls over it won\u2019t break, and the heel has a cutaway so you can get up the neck a lot easier. I run that through a Fractal Axe-Fx III and I\u2019m good to go. I used to have to spend hours getting tones. Now I can just dial in the sound, and boom \u2013 let\u2019s play.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://vintagerock.com/the-rich-williams-interview-2023/", "page_content": "By Ralph Greco, Jr.\n\nPhotos by Ron Lyon\n\nRich Williams has been the long-standing guitarist in Kansas since the band\u2019s formation in 1973. Along with drummer Phil Ehart, the only other original member still onboard, he is about to hit the road for the Kansas 50th Anniversary Tour \u2013 Another Fork In The Road.\n\nReleasing both studio and live albums across the past few years, the band has resumed touring in earnest post-COVID-19. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any stopping the affable Mr. Williams and his band, no matter if he\u2019s wearing overalls or a tux on stage.\n\n~\n\nI wanted to start right there: Is there ever going to be another Native Window album? I love that record.\n\nI really doubt it. That album was born out of the frustration of not recording. Steve (Walsh, original Kansas vocalist and keyboardist)didn\u2019t want to record any new material. And we were frustrated, the rest of us. So, we said, well, let\u2019s just do something else, right? And, of course, we can\u2019t. We can\u2019t be us. So, we took a left turn just to scratch an itch. Get the creative edge going. That was its purpose. It wasn\u2019t to be a departure, a Plan B., another touring entity. It was just simply being creative for a change because we hadn\u2019t been, in that way, for a while.\n\nSo, can one extrapolate from that presently, touring, and making music with Kansas, you\u2019re scratching this itch?\n\nOh absolutely. We\u2019re talking about doing a new album, but we\u2019ve got so many things going on at the moment. We put out the last two studio albums (2016\u2019s The Prelude Implicit and the 2020\u2019s The Absence Of Presence, and we\u2019d like to do another one. The Another Fork In The Road \u2013 50 Years of Kansas set has just come out, and we are touring that which will go into next year, and I\u2019m sure we will more than likely extend beyond the fifty dates. We\u2019re just; we\u2019re busy, you know? The live album came out recently (2017\u2019s Leftoverture Live & Beyond), so there\u2019s been a lot of creativity going on. So yeah, we were scratching the itch constantly.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing to think about how long you guys have been doing this and how well.\n\nIt\u2019s so fun. It\u2019s not like, \u201cOh crap, we\u2019ve got to do a record. What are we gonna do? I don\u2019t wanna do that.\u201d No, it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, here\u2019s the next tour, the next record, what are we gonna do?\u201d Plans change, things move constantly; it\u2019s an ongoing process. We rehearse in the dressing room every night for at least an hour before we go on. And a lot of times, you know, we come up with something brand new. Somebody will play something, and it\u2019s like, \u201cTell me, what was that? Play that again,\u201d and we\u2019ll record it, a spark of an idea for a song in the future. Getting ready for sound check, Tom (Brislin, Kansas keyboardist) will play something. I\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat? What did you play?\u201d And so that process of creating is ongoing, and it\u2019s easy when you know the whole team is into it.\n\nI\u2019m always interested when a band has a big catalog like you guys, and you\u2019re on the road a lot. Beyond featuring an entire album like you sometimes do, how do you pick what songs to play?\n\nWell, there\u2019s, you know, half the set list has already chiseled itself; we know the songs we really need to be playing. So, then it\u2019s just a matter of, you know, maybe we\u2019ve kind of beaten this one to death, let\u2019s put it on the shelf for a while. Or, we haven\u2019t played this in a while. Of course, it\u2019s still in flux, but I think as of yesterday, we\u2019ve finalized the setlist. Of course, as soon as I say that, it\u2019s going to change, right? (laughs) And then the Another Fork in the Road \u2013 50 Years of Kansas kind of dictates a direction as well.\n\nI figured that is what you would be led by.\n\nYeah, we represent each album in the live set as we are, but we noticed yesterday we completely left an album off. So, we take one out because we got too many of those and add in another. So, it\u2019s an ongoing process, making the decisions for us that make sense on a 50th anniversary tour.\n\nSo, any surprises this time around when you went back to a song that you hadn\u2019t played in a long time, and you went, \u201cHoly shit, I\u2019m really having a good time playing that tune!\u201d\n\nWell, we haven\u2019t played these live yet, only in rehearsal. Everybody\u2019s doing homework and relearning songs. And I can\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to let the cat out of the bag, what some of these songs are, but there was one. My wife and I just had a deck put on our house. We got some speakers out there, so we just put Kansas on randomly, and this song came on, and it\u2019s like, I haven\u2019t heard that in a long time. \u2018Oh man, that\u2019s one of my favorite songs. I love the lead I am playing there.\u2019 So that\u2019s one that was added to the list, and I\u2019m really looking forward to performing that song that hasn\u2019t been done in twenty years, and we have two songs we haven\u2019t played for forty-five years. So, it\u2019s been that kind of a thing, and that is very exciting. It\u2019s kind of like opening Christmas presents that you forgot to open a long time ago.\n\nCertainly, as Kansas has changed and morphed over the years, the onus of you as a guitar player shifts as you are sometimes a single player, then there are other guys playing guitar as well with you. How is it different from years ago when you approach playing these days?\n\nWell, yes, there are some spots, yeah, where it is just me. But then, David Ragsdale (Kansas violinist) is a very good guitarist, and we often are playing together. In a song like \u201cIcarus\u201d for instance, he has to go back and forth from guitar to violin, so that song keeps him busy because he is on off on, off on. But often these days, when I want the sound of two guitars, the technology allows me to create it on stage by just stepping on the right button.\n\nYou mention David Ragsdale, and that makes me think of Robbie Steinhardt and his last solo album and the fact that he passed in 2021. Had you spoken to him in a long time? Were you still friends?\n\nWe\u2019re still friends with everybody, all the previous members. Robbie, bless him, always marched to the beat of his own drummer, and even though he was out of the band for a while, when we\u2019d play close to his hometown, he\u2019d come up and do a few numbers with us. I\u2019m not sure who the company or the guys were that got him involved with the solo album. They do a lot of projects like this where they put a lot of material together, and then they bring someone in to do it. They did a great job.\n\nOh yeah, definitely, Not In Kansas Anymore is a very good album.\n\nYeah, I think so. And I had heard that he had plans to go out and tour it. The project wasn\u2019t put together as a band, so he would have had to assemble one. But, of course, that never came to fruition. But Robbie was a dreamer, always had lots of big dreams. And he loved being a rock star, had the old problem with not always showing up on time; he was always the one we\u2019d have to find. That\u2019s the way it was with him from day one. There\u2019s an old band picture; we\u2019re walking down a country road back in Kansas. Five of us are on one side, and Robbie\u2019s on the other, and we\u2019re all walking toward the camera. That really tells the story of Robbie; he was a part of it, but yeah, a step or two away.\n\nDo you find that the other members who come and go defer to you because you and Phil are the long-standing original members?\n\nSomewhere, within the whole process of being in a band, between original members and the newer guys, there is a difference. But that\u2019s not something we project, and it\u2019s not one we demand. It just simply is. It makes a little bit of difference somewhere, I\u2019m sure, but we do our best\u2026I mean, everybody has an equal voice. Like when Tom Brislin joined the band. He\u2019s always been a side man, but we were very direct with him, saying we\u2019re not looking for a side man. You\u2019re not going to be a sideman with us; we want a band member. And he was like, \u201cCan I submit material I\u2019ve written, you know, is that allowable?\u201d And we were like, of course, we wanted him to do that. So, everybody knows they have an equal voice and, you know, rehearsals and working on material, etcetera, ideas. It\u2019s never a situation where it\u2019s don\u2019t say that to the boss. That\u2019s not a healthy dynamic. By method or just by default, Phil and I are the original guys, but that\u2019s no fault of the other guys.\n\nCan you pick a period or an album that you\u2019d say, \u201cMan, that was when we were firing on all pistons?\u201d A time or album when you really felt Kansas had come into its own?\n\nIt happens kind of along the way with a lot of things beyond the original band, even. Something that is always kind of shocking to me is to go back to watch us playing Don Kirshner\u2019s rock concert. We had basically just finished the first album, and suddenly we\u2019re thrust from where we hadn\u2019t really started touring at all yet, and Don Kirshner\u2019s Rock Concert is new. We\u2019re thrust upon the stage, right? And they fill the house with all these people and there\u2019s cameras on stage, there\u2019s cameras everywhere. And they have us just start! I mean, we flew in, it\u2019s like we\u2019re gonna be using a backline, but I said, I\u2019m bringing my guitar, bringing my Marshall head. I didn\u2019t even have a case for it. I can still see it rolling down the conveyor belt; it just had a luggage tag on it. And although you\u2019d never know it, we were scared shitless.\n\nAnd it\u2019s live. That\u2019s the thing lots of people don\u2019t understand. Acts people played live on that show.\n\nYeah, well, and of course, you know, when I watch it that now it\u2019s like, \u201cMy God, what a great band.\u201d\n\nOh, yeah, you guys were smoking. Really great.\n\nYeah, but I remember what it felt like and how terrified we all were. I remember there was a camera two feet from Kerry\u2019s hands as he is soling. We were all so terrified, but it doesn\u2019t come off that way. We had been playing in bars, night after night after night. We were tight. We knew the material, played it inside out right so we could play through our fear. And I see that performance, and I think we really never knew what we had.\n\nI know you are aware of how Kansas is one of a rare breed of American progressive bands growing into its own at a time where most of the progressive sound was coming from the U.K. You are even a rarer breed in the unprecedented success you had.\n\nYeah, there\u2019s always a lot of luck involved, right? And a lot of tenacity involved. And as in anything in the music business, it really required all those elements. The first album did well, the second a little better, the third better than that. But you know Don Kirshner\u2019s (Kansas was signed to Kirshner\u2019s label) coffers were bleeding pretty heavily from supporting three records. I mean, he was a great benefactor, but at that time, the question was, how long can he keep it going? Keep taking it the shorts before he says, \u2018Guys, \u2018m. I\u2019m done.\u2019 So Leftoverture was a crucial album, and the last song to arrive as we\u2019re working material was \u201cWayward Son.\u201d And that song just exploded; I mean, it changed everything.\n\nExploding to this day where it had a crazy second life on the show Supernatural.\n\nOh yeah, the biggest thing that that\u2019s done is give our career a second explosion. We were starting to notice all these young kids are in the front row. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d I\u2019d say all the time, \u201cWhy are you here? How do you know about us?\u201d\n\nYou knew they had used the song, right?\n\nSure, but I wasn\u2019t familiar with the show. I don\u2019t really watch a lot of just whatever\u2019s on television. And we were not that aware of what it was because it wasn\u2019t the official theme song; it\u2019s the unofficial one. And probably, I don\u2019t know, about maybe ten years ago, we started becoming aware of this. And that show had a 15-year run. International, too. Now those fifteen-year-old kids are in their thirties, and along the way, they have discovered our entire catalog. We added a whole generation or two. And we\u2019re still getting younger kids that are watching Supernatural in reruns for the first time. So that\u2019s been tremendous.\n\nAnd then there was the famous Comic-Con performance around the show.\n\nIt was so cool and yes, from the enormous popularity of that show that they had us play there. They spent a fortune on this, on their presentation, and it started with us. They roll the scene in the show of the guys sitting in their car talking to this room of a couple thousand people. There\u2019s screams all the way around. The excitement is building, the room was insane, and we\u2019re watching from 360 degrees right there on stage, and they play the scene, then there\u2019s this big explosion, and we start \u201cWayward Son.\u201d The crowd went insane. And meeting the guys from the show, hanging out. They were two of the most humbled, centered human beings I\u2019ve ever met. Such great guys; you would never guess they were some of the biggest stars.\n\nAnd the Kansas relationship with Supernatural was to have a coda.\n\nYes, we had such a good relationship with them that they wrote us into the final episode. It was going to be some kind of coming together of all the characters, and I\u2019m not sure what the storyline was, but we were supposed to be playing in a bar on the show. And we were headed to the airport to fly up to film, had just finished that leg of our tour of the whole West Coast, and we were told to turn around because Canada had just closed its borders because of COVID. So, we went home and then Oregon, Washington, and California all that day and the next day closed. Then more in a couple of weeks. So, after a while, when they got back to filming, they did a rewrite, and we weren\u2019t in it, unfortunately.\n\nBut then, there\u2019s more; it doesn\u2019t end there, right?\n\nRight. The show was still something we wanted to do; it felt incomplete that we never got the chance to film. So, then there\u2019s this show Walker, a take-off of Walker, Texas Ranger (starring Jared Padalecki, who also starred in Supernatural), and we were playing in Austin, and word came down if we\u2019d like to do a Walker. We had maintained a good relationship with the people involved, so since we were performing in Austin that night, the next afternoon, we shot a Walker, where we were the entertainment for what was supposed to be a Texas Rangers\u2019 convention. So, we got to be with the guys again.\n\nBeing in it as long as you guys have, and then COVID and all that stuff, you still seem to be surfing the business rather well, a business that has drastically changed so much in the last few years.\n\nWell, as far as 2022 was concerned, last year was a pretty normal year. And this year will be, knock on wood barns, barring some new strain or something. I\u2019m not gonna worry about the what-ifs. The way things are right now, it looks like it\u2019s going to be a fantastic year. And I\u2019m just gonna go with that. But the music business, um, from a business standpoint, sucks.\n\nGoing back to Native Window, the reason to make an album for us now is to scratch that itch. Back in the late seventies and eighties, to put out a record and go gold was extremely common; now, it\u2019s an extreme rarity. Only a certain small, thin portion of the pop people of the day really achieve the big goals now. And that has nothing to do with us and hasn\u2019t since the mid-80s. We\u2019ve been out of that market forever. And so, we really don\u2019t concern ourselves with that part of it. But there is still that need to create, to be relevant, to be still creative, even if it\u2019s only for us. And we also have many fans out there who would like to hear new stuff from us.\n\nAbsolutely, me personally.\n\nSo, it\u2019s also to satisfy them, to bring, to provide them with something new, to fulfill their curiosity of where we go next. And since there\u2019s no pressure in it, we can continue that process when we want.\n\nWe covered a lot of ground, and when I told your PR person I was a big fan and knew if left to my own devices, I could talk your ear off. I have one last one a buddy of mine dared me to ask. It\u2019s a sartorial question that has to do with stage costumes.\n\nOK, go ahead (laughs).\n\nLet\u2019s go back a bit if you could remember\u2026\n\nYeah?\n\nTell me about wearing a tux on stage.\n\nI don\u2019t really know exactly what my thought was at the time. When we started out, you know, I\u2019m wearing overalls.\n\nYes. I remember those. That\u2019s why it always struck me \u2014 from overalls to a tux?\n\nPeople misinterpreted the overalls. Thinking, \u201cOh, he must have been a farmer. He\u2019s from Kansas. He rolled the tractor to band practice.\u201d I grew up in an upper middle-class family and a very nice home. The only time I was on a farm was when I visited the farm in England where my mother was born, OK? There\u2019s not a farmer bone in my body.\n\nBut you know, in the late 60s and stuff, the hippie movement, people were wearing overalls, and that was just what I was wearing. They were comfortable. I wasn\u2019t planning to pick peas. I\u2019d tie them with rubber bands, dunk them in bleach, make some tie-dye on them. Whatever, it was just a fashion statement, nonconformity. But then I thought, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll wear a tux, just go the other way, right?\u201d So, I did that for a while, but then suddenly everybody, you know, suddenly Kerry\u2019s wearing a karate kimono. Steve is jumping around in a little Adidas outfit. Then Robbie was in his T-shirts, a real non-conformist in all respects. I think he had, like, a thousand T-shirts in his closet.\n\nI cringe when I look back at some of that stuff. Remember, we were from the middle of Kansas; there was no fashion people, you know, the record company didn\u2019t bring somebody in and tell us we had to work on what we wore. We were left to our own devices. And it\u2019s funny now, but we, I mean, we thought we looked cool at the time, but now I look at it and think, we really did look like freaking dorks.\n\nNever dorks to me and always fantastic musicians and a great band. Thanks so much for taking the time to talk to me.\n\nYou too. Thank you very much.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.vintageguitar.com/35009/richard-williams/", "page_content": "Unleashing pent-up creativity is a gratifying experience for a band, as Kansas guitarist Richard Williams can attest. The band known for the prog-/hard-rock hybrid exemplified by \u201cCarry On Wayward Son\u201d and \u201cDust in the Wind\u201d recently released Leftoverture Live & Beyond, which included the 1976 classic Leftoverture performed in its entirety along with material from 2016\u2019s The Prelude Implicit.\n\nOriginal members Williams and drummer Phil Ehart today lead a rejuvenated lineup that includes longtime bassist Billy Greer, violinist David Ragsdale along with three new members \u2013 vocalist Ronnie Platt, keyboardist David Manion, and guitarist Zak Rizvi. Their collective excitement is palpable on both Leftoverture Live & Beyond and The Prelude Implicit.\n\nLeftoverture Live & Beyond is 19 songs recorded at 12 shows in early 2017.\n\n\u201cThe only song we\u2019d never played live from Leftoverture was \u2018Questions of My Childhood.\u2019 And we didn\u2019t re-record anything or go back in and do overdubs,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cTraditionally, we\u2019ve done a lot of rearrangements of Kansas songs \u2013 sometimes for good, sometimes for not so good. With this new lineup, we\u2019ve gone back as much as we can to the way the songs were written and recorded. We\u2019re trying to lean more on the original arrangements.\u201d\n\nBefore they started work on The Prelude Implicit, the band toured, and it went so well, he said, \u201c\u2026the restraints were off of us, musically.\u201d At first, doubts nagged about their ability to write new songs because former vocalist/keyboardist Steve Walsh and guitarist/keyboardist Kerry Livgren had always been Kansas\u2019 primary songwriters; Somewhere to Elsewhere was Livgren\u2019s material with the original members performing, but Williams said it was \u201can assembly-line thing\u201d with parts recorded separately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the same as sitting in a room with a bunch of guys, developing ideas. That ebb and flow is really where some of our best stuff came from \u2013 not just from one person but by the combination and effort of everybody. We didn\u2019t have that on Somewhere to Elsewhere. That\u2019s what we had on The Prelude Implicit again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe made the album for us as much as we made it for anything else. We didn\u2019t know what it was going to be going into it. We had never done it this way before. We wanted to be quintessentially Kansas from the artwork to the lyrics to the music to the variety within the music \u2013 very well-thought-out to be as Kansas as we possibly can.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2019 main concern has always been about what\u2019s best for Kansas as a whole.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a team player. There\u2019s no Richard Williams solo album. I\u2019ve never had a desire to do a solo album,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my opinion, Kansas has always been the sum of its parts, not so much the talent of any one person. I\u2019ve always just been very comfortable in the role of a team player.\u201d\n\nHis attitude applies to working with other guitarists in Kansas, whether it\u2019s been Livgren, Steve Morse, or Rizvi.\n\n\u201cIn our early days, we were doing an interview and they asked Kerry, \u2018Who\u2019s your biggest influence?\u2019 He said, \u2018Probably Rich, because we play together all the time.\u2019 We were working on equipment together and guitars and guitar tones and different things. You\u2019re not in competition, but constantly working together. That\u2019s all very positive,\u201d said Williams.\n\nFor more than 30 years, Williams\u2019 main electric has been a PRS Custom from \u201984 or \u201985. Early in Kansas, he played a Gibson L-6S that\u2019s still part of his collection of about 30 guitars. He also plays a Martin D-28 based on the one he used on \u201cDust in the Wind.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty nipping at Kansas\u2019 heels in recent years has been replaced with forward-thinking confidence; pending is a tour during which they\u2019ll perform 1977\u2019s Point of Know Return in its entirety, and they\u2019re set to record a new studio album.\n\n\u201cThe quality of the shows and the performance level of the band is at an all-time high,\u201d said Williams. \u201cThe energy level, the crowd enjoyment \u2013 everything \u2013 is greater than it has been since the early days. It feels much like it did on the second, third, and fourth albums,\u201d said Williams. \u201cIt\u2019s that type of focused energy. It\u2019s been a tremendous experience. None of us are looking back, remembering when. Our best days are in front of us.\u201d \u2013 Bret Adams\n\nThis article originally appeared in VG\u2018s June 2018 issue.
