As a guitarist, he toured with Motown singer Marvin Gaye and later played for over twenty years in Henry Mancini\u2019s orchestra until the composer died in 1994. Royce Campbell\n\nJB: How old were you when you started to play jazz guitar and what was most helpful in your personal development as a guitarist?\n\nRC: I was around 16 when I started playing jazz. My uncle, Carroll DeCamp was most helpful in my development. He was an accomplished pianist/guitarist/arranger who played with Wes Montgomery\u2019s group in the 1950s. I learned more from him than I could have from a music school. He also introduced me to a host of older players in the Indianapolis area who also contributed a lot to my development. I learned on the gigs with them rather than in classes. I got a lot of work as a pit orchestra player for musicals and had to develop my reading skills for those jobs. Even though these weren\u2019t jazz gigs, I grew a lot as a player and as a professional.\n\nJB: What are three of the most influential jazz guitar albums and why?\n\nRC: The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery was among the most influential albums for me because it was the first jazz LP I ever bought. It introduced me to jazz guitar. Pat Martino\u2019s album The Visit was another one that was an early influence. It introduced me to Martino and was the first album I attempted to do some transcribing. The other is also a Wes album, Smokin\u2019 at the Half Note. Since this album was live it presented Wes in a looser environment where he could really stretch out so I could hear Wes at his very best.\n\nJB: Practice and listening aside, can you pinpoint one or two \u2018things\u2019 that really boosted your profile and career toward where it\u2019s at today?\n\nRC: Initially, it was my recordings with other guitarists that helped me build a profile in the first place since so many of them were famous. I recorded with Pat Martino, Larry Coryell, John Abercrombie, Bucky Pizzarelli, Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Mundell Lowe, Cal Collins, Charlies, Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Herb Ellis, John Pisano, and Dave Stryker. I am really grateful that I had the chance to be forever associated with them in this way.\n\nIn later periods of my career, the other \u2018thing\u2019 that contributed to my profile was the recordings I was able to do for small labels in Holland, Germany, Italy, and Japan. Those labels specialized in building catalogs of world-class recordings despite the fact that they did not have the resources of bigger labels, and they also gave me a chance to play with and be associated musically with some extraordinary musicians.\n\nJB: Talk about your musical experience with the great Henry Mancini.\n\nRC: My 19 years with Mancini have given me the fondest memories of my career. Not only did I play great music with Mancini, but he was really a great bandleader who was always kind, generous, and loyal to his musicians. I feel that playing his compositions all those years helped my development as a composer.\n\nJB: What was it like working with the Smithsonian Jazz Orchestra in the Washington DC- Northern Virginia area?\n\nRC: Years ago, I played in DC with the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra which is an awesome big band. It might just be one of the most under-appreciated collections of musicians anywhere. I had the honor and privilege to play with incredibly talented colleagues, real\u201d jazz musicians\u2019 musicians.\u201d\n\nJB: What about your career today that you find rewarding?\n\nRC: Due to health issues I\u2019m semi-retired now, but I do some gigs at retirement communities that are rewarding because the residents appreciate the music so much. I also still compose and work on recording projects, some my own and some as collaborations.\n\nJB: Talk about your composing.\n\nRC: Composing is incredibly rewarding. To create something from nothing is pretty special; there is an energy and beauty to the process that is an important counterpoint to some of the darker aspects of our world right now.\n\nI still love to do recording projects. The whole planning process, the actual sessions, and the post-production work are all exciting and energizing, and even though I am getting older, that process never does.\n\nIn a bigger sense, one of the most rewarding aspects of my recording career in particular is that those recordings still draw new, young audiences. It seems that younger generations don\u2019t get hung up as much on specific genres of music or time periods and fashions; they are willing to engage with a broader variety of styles. I am always gratified when I hear from young fans\u2014some fellow guitarists others just new fans\u2014that they enjoyed listening to particular albums. It might be corny, but it makes the last 50+ years in the biz really worth it.\n\nJB: Tell us about the guitar and amp that you use.\n\nRC: I usually use a Benedetto Fratello guitar and an Acoustic Image amp. I do some gigs that include some funk; for that, I use a Gibson ES-335. I also still play a Gibson L5 from time to time. I love the difference in tone that I get from the Benedetto and the Gibson. One is bright and a little cool, and the other is darker and warmer; each offers different possibilities in terms of what I can create.\n\nJB: Tell me about one of your CD albums that best represents your playing.\n\nRC: It\u2019s difficult to pick just one because I\u2019ve done different styles from mainstream jazz to smooth jazz to free jazz. My personal favorite of the 33 CDs I\u2019ve released is the Tribute to Henry Mancini CD. It was an inspiring moment when we recorded it. Mancini was definitely present, and we could all feel it. It made us all play at our best. I recently had a gig with my friend, bassist Bill Moring, and completely without prompting he said much the same thing. He also still remembers that session as musical magic.\n\nJB: How has your playing changed over the years?\n\nRC: I hope it\u2019s gotten better. I feel that over the years my soloing has gotten more melodic. Because I have gotten older and various health conditions have posed challenges, I might not have the same technique I had as a younger player or the speed, but I think my sense of melodic storytelling has been sharpened over the years. Composing and improvising go hand in hand for me and are both ways to tell stories that listeners can relate to. I happen to be a romantic, and melodic lines tell the stories that I want to tell, so I have been working on that all my life, though it\u2019s become even more important in recent years.\n\nSubscribe to Jazz Guitar Today \u2013 it\u2019s FREE!"}, {"url": "https://www.indianapolisjazzhalloffame.org/inductee/royce-campbell", "page_content": "Royce Campbell\n\n(June 7, 1952 - Present)\n\nRoyce Campbell, jazz guitarist, was a member of the Henry Mancini orchestra for twenty years and whose blues-influenced, jazz-guitar playing has earned him accolades as a solo performer and sought-after session musician. Born in North Vernon, Indiana with a stepfather who was career military, Campbell grew up in cities throughout the U.S. and the world. He started playing the guitar at 9 and the first jazz guitarist he was interested in was Wes Montgomery. By the time he finished high school in Spain in the early 1970s, he had decided to pursue a career in music. His uncle, pianist Carroll DeCamp, who had done arrangements for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited him to Indianapolis to live and study. His uncle provided his education in music theory and composition and at 21, he toured with rhythm and blues (R&B) singer Marvin Gaye before spending twenty years as a member of the Henry Mancini orchestra until Mancini's death in 1994.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Campbell recorded more as a leader. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis, and fellow Hoosier Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker, and Bucky Pizzarelli. On Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass (1999) he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano.\n\nIn addition to recording with many of the greats of the jazz guitar, Royce has had multiple tours in Europe and Japan as a soloist. Royce has also performed with many other jazz giants such as Mel Torme, James Moody, Nancy Wilson, Sarah Vaughn, Jack McDuff, Ray Brown, Dave Brubeck, Joe Williams, Cleo Laine, Eddie Daniels, Eddie Harris, Frank Morgan, Ken Poplowski, Gerry Mulligan, Houston Person, Freddy Cole, Vanessa Rubin, Jimmy Cobb, Fred Hersch, Rosemary Clooney, and Mose Allison.\n\nRecording since 1983 and with more than 30 albums as a leader, Campbell has said he is most proud of his 2009 release Solo Mancini: A Solo Guitar Tribute to Henry Mancini."}, {"url": "https://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en/music-database/musician/23863981e9384cb3556b8909564e1e4c966d7f/biography", "page_content": "Royce Campbell\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nRoyce Campbell is a jazz guitarist.\n\nRoyce Campbell was born in Seymour, Indiana, in 1952. The son of a career navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.[1]\n\nBy the time Royce finished high school in the early 1970s, he was certain he wanted to pursue a professional career in music. His uncle, Carroll DeCamp, an arranger/pianist who arranged for Stan Kenton and Les Elgart, invited Royce to live with him and study in Indiana, providing most of Royce's musical education in theory and composition, and by age 21, Campbell had begun touring with R&B artist Marvin Gaye and developing his talents for stage performance. In 1975, Royce was hired by a local music contractor to do three concerts with award-winning film composer Henry Mancini in Indianapolis. Soon after Royce became the touring guitarist with Henry Mancini's orchestra, holding that positing until Mancini's death in 1994.[2]\n\nWhile appearing on recordings as a sideman, and a couple as leader, during the early years of his career, Campbell started recording and touring more on his own during the 1990s, focusing at first on mainstream or straight-ahead jazz. Although he cites Wes Montgomery as his main influence, horn players such as Dexter Gordon and Chet Baker are evident in Royces, tone and approach to changes. In 1993, he produced Project G-5: A Tribute to Wes Montgomery which also featured guitarists Tal Farlow, Jimmy Raney, Herb Ellis and Cal Collins. His 1994 album 6x6 featured guitarists Pat Martino, John Abercrombie, Larry Coryell, Dave Stryker and Bucky Pizzarelli.With Project G-5: A Tribute to Joe Pass, in 1999, he combined the talents of Charlie Byrd, Gene Bertoncini, Mundell Lowe, and John Pisano.\n\nDuring his career Royce Campbell has released more than 30 CDs as leader or co-leader among various sideman projects. Fifteen of these CDs have made it onto the US national jazz radio charts. Campbell's soloing is documented among other jazz guitarists of the era, in Mel Bay's Anthology of Jazz Guitar Solos: Featuring Solos by the World's Finest Jazz Guitarists!

I lived there for the first five years. Then my mom remarried a career Naval officer, and we moved around a lot when I was a kid. I've lived in three foreign countries\u0097Barbados, Japan and Spain\u0097and in many U.S. cities.\n\n\n\nJW: When did you start playing guitar?\n\nRC: At age 9 after seeing Chuck Berry on TV. I told my mom I wanted a guitar and she bought one for me. But I didn't get serious about music until age 16, when my uncle Carroll DeCamp exposed me to jazz. He had arranged for Stan Kenton and Eddie Daniels. He arranged my album with strings, Plays for Lovers. Having a world-class musician in the family actually made it easier when I told my parents that I wanted to be a musician. They were very supportive.\n\n\n\nJW: Where did you go to music school?\n\nRC: I didn't. I didn't have a formal music education. My uncle was my education. When I graduated from high school in Spain, he invited me to live with him for a few years in Indianapolis, and I welcomed the stability after moving around so much. He showed me things and was always there to answer questions. So I'm primarily self-taught.\n\n\n\nJW: Can you read music?\n\nRC: Yes. I had music lessons at a music store in Louisville, Kentucky, when my family lived there. When I lived with my uncle later, I began playing locally. Then I began to get noticed. Soon I was the first-call guitarist in Indianapolis.\n\n\n\nJW: Is that how you landed a job with Marvin Gaye?\n\nRC: Yes. I was called to join his concert orchestra in late 1973. At the time, his big hit was Let's Get It On. I was 21 years old and did three tours with him\u0097at three or four days apiece. All of the charts were written out. I knew at the time it was kind of a big deal, especially when we started playing major arenas with screaming fans. They had bouncers at the edge of the stages who would throw women back into the audience when they tried to climb up there. I really got an education about the music business on those tours.\n\n\n\nJW: How so?\n\nRC: For one, we were paid poorly. Marvin's band hired young musicians so they didn't have to pay us much. We also traveled on buses without hotel stays, again for savings. Being on the road was very rough, even by the 1970s. The rhythm section was huge\u0097there were eight pieces. Marvin didn't have many interactions with band members. He'd just come in toward the end of a sound check and then show up for the concert.\n\n\n\nJW: What was your overall impression of Gaye?\n\nRC: He seemed introverted for a star. He seemed almost like a reluctant celebrity. You don't really run into that anymore. Anyone who has a high profile today is completely committed to touring and fully understands their responsibilities to audiences and musicians. But back then, concerts were an afterthought, a replay of albums that crowds had already owned. Today, concerts mean everything. It's where the money is made. So a star's commitment to performing and stamina have to be there.\n\n\n\nJW: What was your favorite Gaye song to play?\n\nRC: Inner City Blues. I love the phrasing. The other thing about Marvin is that he never did the same song the same way twice. He changed them up every night. He could improvise.\n\n\n\nJW: How did you wind up touring with Henry Mancini for 19 years? RC: The same way. An Indianapolis music contractor called me in 1975. It was a time when Henry was thinking about taking on a regular guitarist. Then I impressed him enough to stay on for all his live gigs going forward. The venues for those concerts were large auditoriums. Over the years he kept adding instruments to the point where we were eventually the size of a symphony orchestra.\n\n\n\nJW: Do you think your years with Mancini influenced your tasteful, patient style?\n\nRC: Thank you. Yes, absolutely. After all that time with Henry, playing his music, I came to understand what a master of melody and romance he was. I feel it rubbed off on me.\n\n\n\nJW: What surprised you most about Mancini?\n\nRC: Henry told me that he wished he could play jazz, which came as a surprise. He said, \u0093I'd love a genie to give me the power to be a jazz pianist, to be able to improvise.\" Henry wrote beautifully and played beautifully. But he also wanted to improvise and was lightly frustrated that he couldn't do so with conviction.\n\n\n\nJW: As an insider, what's special about Mancini's music?\n\nRC: Henry's style and how clear his ideas were. A lot of arrangers get carried away. They write cluttered arrangements or go too far. Henry learned early what not to do. He told me one of his first arranging jobs was for Benny Goodman. Eager to impress, he wrote a chart that was hard on the trumpets. The first trumpet took him aside and told him that he had to learn to write cleaner lines. That was a wake-up call for him.\n\n\n\nJW: What did he learn?\n\nRC: He learned that when it came to writing and composing, you have to take out all the fluff. He said, \u0093You just want to leave the meat and potatoes.\"\n\n\n\nJW: Anything else?\n\nRC: Henry knew how to figure out the right balance between creating music that musicians would like to play and music that audiences wanted to hear. I strive for that, too. I can write and play stuff that's far out, things that certainly would impress musicians. I love free jazz. It's a lot of fun. But it's a stretch for audiences. Most listeners have a hard time getting it.\n\n\n\nJW: What's the hardest thing about playing pretty?\n\nRC: Keeping it simple. That's hard. If you play notes that don't fit the melody or you play too fast, you start to lose your listeners. A guitar is different than most other instruments. It's highly audible and most often you're playing one note at a time. So listeners' ears catch every one of them. If you play notes that don't fit or you jam in too many notes, audiences stop listening to the instrument's storyline.\n\n\n\nJW: What's most important?\n\nRC: As a guitarist, you must know harmony inside and out to play melodically. You have to know how the notes you play relate to the melody. It's not about scales. It's about the harmony, about the notes the listener will find familiar and will welcome even more than the melody itself.\n\nAs a jazz guitarist, it's not easy to play pretty. You have to worship harmony, you have to love the sound of the instrument, and you have to want to seduce audiences. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, guitarists like Barry Galbraith, Jimmy Raney, Chuck Wayne, Mundell Lowe, Wes Montgomery and others understood the conversational quality and beckoning nature of the instrument. One guitarist around today who is carrying that torch is Royce Campbell.Royce's name might not ring a bell, since he rarely performs publicly these days. I've enjoyed his music for years through his magnificent 1996 album, A Tribute to Henry Mancini. So it was a surprise a week or so ago when I received a lovely email from him complimenting me on a post. I've long wanted to tell him how much I enjoy his playing. Royce today spends much of his time recording and composing down in Virginia. But he's considering offers to play clubs again, and I hope he does. He's an absolute joy on the ears, and I can listen to his patient, lyrical playing for hours on end.Royce and I spoke yesterday about his early life and playing with Marvin Gaye and Henry Mancini:Royce Campbell's playing is gorgeous. Like Henry Mancini's music, Royce's lines caress your ears until you're won over to what he's playing.Three of my favorite albums by Royce are A Tribute to Henry Mancini, Plays for Lovers and What Is This Thing Called. You'll find them iTunes or here here and here The first album is one of the finest tribute albums to the late composer. On the second album, Royce is backed by a string section beautifully arranged by Carroll DeCamp. The third CD is a clever concept. Each song is based on the chord changes to standards but Royce has given them different melody lines and new titles. So we have I Fall in Love Too Hard, Have You Met Miss Smith and How About Me?

I\u2019m currently playing a \u201970 Gibson L-5 and I also have a Benedetto Fratello.\n\nJGL: What other gear are you using? Do you have a specific stage set-up that works best for you in a variety of musical situations?\n\nRC: I just use an Acoustic Image amp through a Raezer\u2019s Edge speaker.\n\nJGL: Who were your influences on jazz guitar when you were beginning, and have they stayed the same or have they changed over the years? Who are you listening to today (guitarists or non-guitarists)?\n\nRC: Wes Montgomery is by far my main influence. Some other of my favorites are Tal Farlow, Jim Hall, Jimmy Raney and Pat Martino.\n\nJGL: In the same vein, who has been most influential in your life as a Jazz Guitarist and why?\n\nRC: Wes.\n\nJGL: Is there anyone \u2013 alive or dead \u2013 who you\u2019d love to play and/or record with and why?\n\nRC: Chet Baker or Miles Davis. I love their melodic styles.\n\nJGL: I\u2019ve really enjoyed your playing in all that I\u2019ve heard you do, from straight-ahead to some outside playing as well. What was your practice routine like when you were beginning and what is it like now? Are there specific areas that you work on or do you just play through tunes?\n\nRC: I never practiced scales. I just worked on playing songs and improvising over the chords.\n\nJGL: What would you advise students of Jazz Guitar to work on if you could only choose two components?\n\nRC: Harmony and melody.\n\nJGL: You were Henry Mancini\u2019s guitarist for 19 years which is very impressive. How did you land the gig?\n\nRC: I was hired by a music contractor to do a couple of concerts with Mancini in Indiana and Mancini asked me to be his regular after those concerts. I must have impressed him.\n\nJGL: Was this only for touring or did you also record with him as well?\n\nRC: Touring only.\n\nJGL: As Mancini\u2019s guitar player, what was expected of you and were there any challenges that caught you off guard?\n\nRC: It was usually easy rhythm guitar parts. The challenge was just to blend in well with the full orchestra.\n\nJGL: You have been very open about your health issues on Face Book and at one point it looked like you would be hanging up your guitar for good. How is your health these days and is it still affecting your playing?\n\nRC: It\u2019s been a long road but I feel like I\u2019m pretty much back.\n\nJGL: Apart from Mr. Mancini, you have played with a variety of super-stars including Marvin Gaye, The Pointer Sisters, Dave Brubeck, Quincy Jones, Pavarotti, Mose Allison, Gerry Mulligan, Brother Jack McDuff, Ray Brown, Rosemary Clooney and Sarah Vaughn to name the most popular of performers. Do any of these musical associations stand out more than others? (in a positive sense of course)\n\nRC: All those names are great so one doesn\u2019t really stand out to me. Of those names, I worked the most with Marvin Gaye.\n\nJGL: Having worked with so many popular artists, you\u2019ve been outspoken about not working as much as you feel you should. Given your status as a top-shelf musician and player, why do you think it is that work is hard to come by? Do you think it\u2019s a sign of the times? Or is it a young players game now?\n\nRC: Jazz just isn\u2019t very popular and getting less so all the time. No way could I make a living as a player anymore. I make my main income from composer royalties, downloads and streaming sales.\n\nJGL: You\u2019ve been recording since 1983 and have more than 30 albums out as a leader. Sadly I am only aware of a few \u201cSix by Six\u201d \u2013 which I reviewed, \u201cProject G-5, A Tribute to Wes Montgomery\u201d and \u201cElegy to a Friend\u201d \u2013 which I have also reviewed. Are these albums still available and if so, how would one go about purchasing them from you? Also, do you plan on recording anymore?\n\nRC: All my CD\u2019s are available through the usual outlets: CDBaby, Amazon or directly from me www.roycecampbell.net Yes, I recently recorded an organ trio album.\n\nJGL: Among your prodigious number of recordings are there any that you dig more than the others? Any special moments you would like to share from these sessions?\n\nRC: I like my Tribute to Henry Mancini CD the best.\n\nJGL: It seems like you\u2019ve done it all! What type of musical situation do you enjoy the most (ie: trio, quartet, duo, solo, etc.) and is there something that you\u2019d still like to do?\n\nRC: I have pretty much done it all. I haven\u2019t done anything with a string quartet.\n\nJGL: Conversely, almost every musician, no matter their level and professional stature have their own insecurities to deal with when it comes to music and playing their instrument. What, if any, insecurities do you face on your instrument and how do you work at getting over them?\n\nRC: I wish I had better technique to feel more at ease playing real fast tempos. The only way to get over that is to practice a lot.\n\nJGL: In 2010 you were inducted into the Indianapolis Jazz Foundation Hall of Fame. Wow, how cool is that!!?? What was that experience like?\n\nRC: It was a surprise and an honor.\n\nJGL: What\u2019s your personal take on the health of Jazz Guitar in particular and the genre in general these days?\n\nRC: Not good.\n\nJGL: Do you find the business side of being a Jazz musician something that should be taught in music schools or should the playing be left to the player and the business side of things be left to managers and agents?\n\nRC: I think the business angle should be addressed in school.\n\nJGL: What \u2013 if any \u2013 new technology (ie: Internet, Face Book, YouTube, Instagram etc\u2026) do you incorporate into your looking to get gigs or get hired?\n\nRC: I try to use whatever is available.\n\nJGL: Any advice for the younger guy or gal who is thinking about playing jazz guitar?\n\nRC: Learn how to read music and study harmony, harmony and more harmony.\n\nJGL: Have you ever had second thoughts about your choice to have music as a career and if so, what other career path do you think you would have followed had you not been a guitar player.\n\nRC: Photography or art.\n\nJGL: If you had to do one thing over again, what would it be and why?\n\nRC: If I had to do thing over I think I would have stuck more to one style instead of trying to be a jack-of-all-trades.\n\nJGL: What does the future hold for Royce Campbell?\n\nRC: I\u2019d like to do more recording and hopefully some concerts.\n\nJGL: Before I bring this interview to a close, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that you have a fondness for funny word-plays, which I enjoy as well. Can you share a few with us and have you ever gotten into trouble for using such word-plays in public or on the job?\n\nRC: I\u2019ve used word play in some of my titles such a In A Sorta Mental Mood and Bossa Me Mucho . So far my puns haven\u2019t gotten me in trouble. So far."}, {"url": "https://www.jazzwax.com/2010/09/royce-campbell-beautiful-guitar.html", "page_content": "As a jazz guitarist, it's not easy to play pretty. You have to worship harmony, you have to love the sound of the instrument, and you have to want to seduce audiences. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, guitarists like Barry Galbraith, Jimmy Raney, Chuck Wayne, Mundell Lowe, Wes Montgomery and others understood the conversational quality and beckoning nature of the instrument. One guitarist around today who is carrying that torch is Royce Campbell.\n\nRoyce's name might not ring a bell, since he rarely performs publicly these days. I've enjoyed his music for years through his magnificent 1996 album, A Tribute to Henry Mancini . So it was a surprise a week or so ago when I received a lovely email from him complimenting me on a post. I've long wanted to tell him how much I enjoy his playing. Royce today spends much of his time recording and composing down in Virginia. But he's considering offers to play clubs again, and I hope he does. He's an absolute joy on the ears, and I can listen to his patient, lyrical playing for hours on end.\n\nRoyce and I spoke yesterday about his early life and playing with Marvin Gaye and Henry Mancini:\n\nJazzWax: When were you born?\n\nRoyce Campbell: In North Vernon, Indiana, in 1952. I lived there for the first five years. Then my mom remarried a career Naval officer, and we moved around a lot when I was a kid. I've lived in three foreign countries\u2014Barbados, Japan and Spain\u2014and in many U.S. cities.\n\n\n\nJW: When did you start playing guitar?\n\nRC: At age 9 after seeing Chuck Berry on TV. I told my mom I wanted a guitar and she bought one for me. But I didn\u2019t get serious about music until age 16, when my uncle Carroll DeCamp exposed me to jazz. He had arranged for Stan Kenton and Eddie Daniels. He arranged my album with strings, Plays for Lovers. Having a world-class musician in the family actually made it easier when I told my parents that I wanted to be a musician. They were very supportive.\n\n\n\nJW: Where did you go to music school?\n\nRC: I didn\u2019t. I didn't have a formal music education. My uncle was my education. When I graduated from high school in Spain, he invited me to live with him for a few years in Indianapolis, and I welcomed the stability after moving around so much. He showed me things and was always there to answer questions. So I\u2019m primarily self-taught.\n\n\n\nJW: Can you read music?\n\nRC: Yes. I had music lessons at a music store in Louisville, Kentucky, when my family lived there. When I lived with my uncle later, I began playing locally. Then I began to get noticed. Soon I was the first-call guitarist in Indianapolis.\n\n\n\nJW: Is that how you landed a job with Marvin Gaye?\n\nRC: Yes. I was called to join his concert orchestra in late 1973. At the time, his big hit was Let\u2019s Get It On. I was 21 years old and did three tours with him\u2014at three or four days apiece. All of the charts were written out. I knew at the time it was kind of a big deal, especially when we started playing major arenas with screaming fans. They had bouncers at the edge of the stages who would throw women back into the audience when they tried to climb up there. I really got an education about the music business on those tours.\n\n\n\nJW: How so?\n\nRC: For one, we were paid poorly. Marvin's band hired young musicians so they didn't have to pay us much. We also traveled on buses without hotel stays, again for savings. Being on the road was very rough, even by the 1970s. The rhythm section was huge\u2014there were eight pieces. Marvin didn\u2019t have many interactions with band members. He\u2019d just come in toward the end of a sound check and then show up for the concert.\n\n\n\nJW: What was your overall impression of Gaye?\n\nRC: He seemed introverted for a star. He seemed almost like a reluctant celebrity. You don\u2019t really run into that anymore. Anyone who has a high profile today is completely committed to touring and fully understands their responsibilities to audiences and musicians. But back then, concerts were an afterthought, a replay of albums that crowds had already owned. Today, concerts mean everything. It's where the money is made. So a star's commitment to performing and stamina have to be there.\n\n\n\nJW: What was your favorite Gaye song to play?\n\nRC: Inner City Blues. I love the phrasing. The other thing about Marvin is that he never did the same song the same way twice. He changed them up every night. He could improvise.\n\n\n\nJW: How did you wind up touring with Henry Mancini for 19 years?\n\nRC: The same way. An Indianapolis music contractor called me in 1975. It was a time when Henry was thinking about taking on a regular guitar player. Then I impressed him enough to stay on for all his live gigs going forward. The venues for those concerts were large auditoriums. Over the years he kept adding instruments to the point where we were eventually the size of a symphony orchestra.\n\n\n\nJW: Do you think your years with Mancini influenced your tasteful, patient style?\n\nRC: Thank you. Yes, absolutely. After all that time with Henry, playing his music, I came to understand what a master of melody and romance he was. I feel it rubbed off on me.\n\n\n\nJW: What surprised you most about Mancini?\n\nRC: Henry told me that he wished he could play jazz, which came as a surprise. He said, \u201cI\u2019d love a genie to give me the power to be a jazz pianist, to be able to improvise.\u201d Henry wrote beautifully and played beautifully. But he also wanted to improvise and was lightly frustrated that he couldn't do so with conviction.\n\n\n\nJW: As an insider, what's special about Mancini\u2019s music?\n\nRC: Henry's style and how clear his ideas were. A lot of arrangers get carried away. They write cluttered arrangements or go too far. Henry learned early what not to do. He told me one of his first arranging jobs was for Benny Goodman. Eager to impress, he wrote a chart that was hard on the trumpets. The first trumpet took him aside and told him that he had to learn to write cleaner lines. That was a wake-up call for him.\n\n\n\nJW: What did he learn?\n\nRC: He learned that when it came to writing and composing, you have to take out all the fluff. He said, \u201cYou just want to leave the meat and potatoes.\u201d\n\n\n\nJW: Anything else?\n\nRC: Henry knew how to figure out the right balance between creating music that musicians would like to play and music that audiences wanted to hear. I strive for that, too. I can write and play stuff that\u2019s far out, things that certainly would impress musicians. I love free jazz. It\u2019s a lot of fun. But it\u2019s a stretch for audiences. Most listeners have a hard time getting it.\n\n\n\nJW: What\u2019s the hardest thing about playing pretty?\n\nRC: Keeping it simple. That's hard. If you play notes that don\u2019t fit the melody or you play too fast, you start to lose your listeners. A guitar is different than most other instruments. It\u2019s highly audible and most often you're playing one note at a time. So listeners\u2019 ears catch every one of them. If you play notes that don\u2019t fit or you jam in too many notes, audiences stop listening to the instrument's storyline.\n\n\n\nJW: What\u2019s most important?\n\nRC: As a guitarist, you must know harmony inside and out to play melodically. You have to know how the notes you play relate to the melody. It\u2019s not about scales. It\u2019s about the harmony, about the notes the listener will find familiar and will welcome even more than the melody itself.\n\nJazzWax clips: Royce Campbell's playing is gorgeous. Like Henry Mancini's music, Royce's lines caress your ears until you're won over to what he's playing.\n\nThree of my favorite albums by Royce are A Tribute to Henry Mancini, Plays for Lovers and What Is This Thing Called. You'll find them iTunes or here, here and here.\n\nThe first album is one of the finest tribute albums to the late composer. On the second album, Royce is backed by a string section beautifully arranged by Carroll DeCamp. The third CD is a clever concept. Each song is based on the chord changes to standards but Royce has given them different melody lines and new titles. So we have I Fall in Love Too Hard, Have You Met Miss Smith and How About Me?\n\nJazzWax clip: Here's Royce Campbell playing a blues with all chords..."}, {"url": "https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=Royce%20Campbell", "page_content": "Royce Campbell\n\ng, *1952 US, North Vernon, Indiana\n\nMusician of Jazz and Spoken Word\n\nRoyce Campbell (born June 7, 1952) is a jazz guitarist primarily associated with mainstream jazz, but also has released smooth jazz and post bop jazz recordings.Campbell was born in Seymour, Indiana. The son of a career navy man, Campbell grew up in various cities around the U.S. and abroad, including Asia, Europe, and the West Indies. Exposure to various musical genres while a child contributed to Campbell's musical style and approach in jazz composition and playing. A love for rock and roll marked Campbell's first connection with the guitar, at the age of nine, when he discovered Chuck Berry. Like many guitarists of his generation, Campbell was also influenced by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton."}, {"url": "https://rambles.net/campbell_gsoul06.html", "page_content": "For those expecting an album of fast-paced gypsy-style music, you will be disappointed, but with well over a dozen albums and a reference list that reads like a who's who in the entertainment world, the title of Royce Campbell's newest album Gypsy Soul is very appropriate as a description for his musical career. Campbell began playing guitar at age 9. After high school it wasn't long before his reputation as a quality musician was well known. His first professional gig was a two-year stint with soul legend Marvin Gaye. Then what started out as a three-performance fill-in for Henry Mancini turned into a 19-year engagement. Along the way, Campbell has played with such notable artists as Dave Brubeck, Sarah Vaughn, Mel Torme, Rosemary Clooney, Gerry Mulligan, Bob Hope, Liza Minelli, the Drifters, Luciano Pavoratti, Andy Williams, Perry Como, Julia Andrews and many many more. On his newest album, Gypsy Soul, Campbell demonstrates the quality of his musicianship with a collection of 10 jazz tunes. The simplicity of instrumentation on the album -- only a bass and drum play with Campbell -- allows Campbell's expertise on the guitar to shine through. Gypsy Soul allows the listener to either just sit back and relax -- to chill out -- or for the guitar enthusiast to follow along and listen in to Campbell's style of playing. Gypsy Soul is the type of CD that's good as a multi-purpose album -- from everything from background music at a dinner party to working to learning some new riffs or techniques. by Sherrill Fulghum\n\nRambles.NET\n\n19 May 2007 [ visit the artist's website ]"}]}
