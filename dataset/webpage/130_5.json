{"Bill Brown went on to make over 100 appearances for the club before moving to Celtic in 1957.": [{"url": "https://dundeefc.co.uk/club/history/hall-of-fame/", "page_content": "Dundee Football Club is proud of its history that has developed ever since it became the first professional football club founded in the city in 1893. That history has not been achieved by time but by the achievements, star quality and inspirational characteristics of the players and management who have served our great Club.\n\nIn 2008 the Directors of the Club decided to mark the achievements of these legendary figures and a Committee was set up decide the criteria for the Hall of Fame. The public were asked to vote for their favourites through the official matchday programme, website and local newspapers and the idea sparked great debate amongst the Dark Blue support. After hundreds of votes were cast, a total of eight legendary players were inducted in the inaugural Dundee Football Club Hall of Fame on Friday 3rd April 2009\n\nInductees\n\nWILLIAM \u201cPLUM\u201d LONGAIR \u2013 2009 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nThe first Inductee into the Hall of Fame was William \u201cPlum\u201d Longair who served the club for 33 years, captaining the side in its first ever match in 1893 against Rangers at West Craigie Park. He went on to make over 100 appearances and brought international recognition to Dundee by becoming its first ever-international player when capped against Wales in 1894. After his retirement from playing he helped train the team, including the Scottish Cup winners of 1910 and in over 20 years of coaching he never missed a game.\n\nOn his death in 1926 an estimated 20,000 people lined the streets as his coffin was taken from his home in Victoria Street to Eastern Cemetery to honour one of the greatest footballing figures in the early development of football in the city.\n\nDOUG COWIE \u2013 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nThe next entry into the Hall of Fame was Doug Cowie who played 446 games for the club in a 16-year spell; a club record. The highlight of his career came when Dundee won the League Cup in successive seasons against Rangers and Kilmarnock in 1951 and 1952. The winner\u2019s medals were overdue after Dundee and Doug sadly lost the League title on the last day of the 1948/49 season.\n\nPlaying at either wing-half or centre-half made no difference to Doug, his skill and elegance on the ball was always on show. Even the bullish Billy Steel admitted that his half back could \u201cplay a wee bit\u201d.\n\nIn 1953 Doug made his international debut alongside Billy as Scotland drew 2-2 against England at Wembley. It was the first of 20 full caps for the national side and all gained whilst playing for Dundee. He is the only Dundee player to represent his country in two World Cup Finals.\n\nCLAUDIO CANIGGIA \u2013 2009 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nThe first ever International Award was given to Claudio Caniggia whose arrival in the City of Discovery in many ways mirrored that of Billy Steel fifty years previously. Both arrivals stunned the Scottish football scene and brought massive media attention and while both arrived with a reputation as controversial characters, they were quickly taken to the hearts of a Dens public who recognised their undoubted ability.Caniggia was aged 33 in September 2000 and hadn\u2019t played for months but from the moment he took to the field for his debut as a substitute at Pittodrie there was no doubt that he was still the real deal. His last minute goal was pure theatre and 3,000 Dark Blue fans headed south from the Granite City that evening ready to tell anyone who hadn\u2019t been lucky enough to make the trip \u201cI was there when Claudio played for Dundee for the first time.\u201dIn the weeks and months that followed it was unusual to see a replica top with anything other than \u2018Caniggia 33\u2019 on the back as \u2018The Tayzurri\u2019 revelled in the Argentinean\u2019s presence on Tayside \u2013 and on the field the darting runs of a man who still had phenomenal acceleration over short distances lit up a season when entertainment almost seemed more important than results. It was a brief stay on Tayside but full of so many fond memories for Dundee supporters.\n\nBARRY SMITH \u2013 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nCaniggia\u2019s captain Barry Smith was next into the Hall of Fame. Few would have imagined that when Barry arrived at Dens in 1995 as part of the deal which saw Morton Wieghorst move to Celtic, that the club would be welcoming a man who would go on to be one of the finest captains in the clubs history. Barry\u2019s time at Dens spanned over 11 years and as captain led the club to the First Division Championship, a Scottish Cup Final and the club\u2019s return to Europe after a 27 year absence.Dundee spent seven seasons in the SPL with Barry as captain, in the first year the side finished 5th under the management of Jocky Scott. The next few seasons saw Barry as the Scottish heart in Ivano Bonetti\u2019s continental Dees before Jim Duffy took over and led the club to the Scottish Cup Final. His legendary status was further enhanced on how he captained the side through the pain of Administration in November 2003 before going on to taste success winning the Icelandic league with FC Valur. In late 2008, Barry was welcomed back to Dens as part of Jocky Scott\u2019s backroom staff. Taking charge of the under 19\u2019s he was given the chance to join Brechin on loan to continue playing until the club came calling again in October 2009 and asked him to take up the position of caretaker-manager when the club fell into Administration for a second time. The heroic efforts in overcoming a draconian 25-point penalty from the Scottish Football League to avoid relegation had many wondering if he could be voted into the Hall of Fame for a second time.\n\nBILLY STEEL \u2013 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nIn September 1950 the next entrant of the Dundee Hall of Fame had developed into one of the first football superstars with 17 Scottish caps to his name and since his wonder goal for Great Britain against the Rest of the World in 1947, he was regarded as one of the best inside forwards in the world. George Anderson wanted the best for Dundee and in Billy Steel there was no finer inside forward so when an initial approach was rejected he re-doubled his efforts and offered a new record British transfer fee of \u00a323,500.\n\nBilly\u2019s outstanding ability gave him a confidence, often seen as arrogance, however a year after his arrival Dundee beat Rangers to win the League Cup with Billy setting up Alfie Boyd for the winning goal. Success bred more success and the following year Dundee became the first club to retain the League Cup by beating Kilmarnock in the final.\n\nBilly Steel played a total of 131 games for the club scoring 45 goals and also gained a further 13 Scotland caps during his Dens career, playing alongside Doug Cowie in two Internationals against England and Sweden. In over 40 years involvement in local football Tommy Gallagher regarded Billy Steel as the best player ever to play for Dundee and many who were lucky to watch him would agree.\n\nJOCKY SCOTT \u2013 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nJocky Scott\u2019s place in the Club\u2019s Hall of Fame was never in doubt after a 45-year connection with the Club after arriving as a 16 year old in 1964 and made his debut in a 6-0 win over Motherwell at Dens. Two weeks later he scored the first of his many career goals for The Dee with his double putting Dundee on the way to a 4-1 derby win at Tannadice.The creative part of his game was as important as the goals he scored and a succession of Dens strikers would testify to the service supplied by the keen football brain of Scott and he was part of the Dundee that beat Celtic on a rain swept day in 1973 to win the League Cup Final at Hampden and bring the cup back to Tayside for the third time. The run to the Scottish Cup semi-final in the same season saw Dundee regarded as the best in the country at the time. Jocky returned to Dens as a player in 1980 playing five more first team games but it was as a coach that his future would map out. He progressed to assistant-manager at Dens under Archie Knox and took over the hot seat when Knox returned to Aberdeen. It was the first of three spells in charge at Dens.\n\nALAN GILZEAN \u2013 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nThere have been some great forwards in Dundee\u2019s history but none have had a strike rate to match Alan Gilzean, the Coupar Angus born hit-man delivering 169 goals in 190 top-flight competitive appearances in the club\u2019s colours.\n\nHe holds almost every club goalscoring record \u2013 most career goals, most goals in a season, European top scorer, most hat-tricks and shares the honour of scoring most goals in a game when he netted an incredible seven goals against Queen of the South in December 1962. That season Gillie\u2019s fame spread throughout the Continent as Dundee progressed to the European Cup semi-final, beating Cologne, Sporting Lisbon and Anderlecht on the way.\n\nAmazingly the following season he surpassed his impressive scoring rate with 52 goals in 48 games and a winner for Scotland against England in April 1964. A month later he scored twice as Scotland drew 2-2 with West Germany in Hanover and by now it was obvious that English clubs would come calling for his talents. In December 1964 he moved to Tottenham Hotspur but not before signing off in style with a hat-trick against St Johnstone.\n\nBOBBY COX \u2013 2009 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nThe inaugural Hall of Fame Dinner came to a fitting close with the final Legends Award going to whom Dundee supporters simply called Mr Dundee \u2013 Bobby Cox.\n\nHe was born overlooking Dens Park and was educated at nearby SS Peter and Paul then St. Johns,signing for Dundee in 1955 and a year later after only four reserve games he was given his debut at home to Queens Park. The story of a Legend had begun.\n\nBobby was an almost ever present in the side for the next decade only missing out for injuries to his cartilage and slipped disc. He was given the honour of taking over the club captaincy from Doug Cowie and thus leading the club into its finest hour at Muirton Park on 28th April 1962.\n\nThat League championship brought qualification to the European Cup and Bobby led the team on the brilliant aggregate defeats of Cologne, Sporting Lisbon and Anderlecht. Injury against Motherwell ruled him out against AC Milan in the semi-final and robbed Dundee of one of its most influential players. Bobby would experience further European ties in the European Cup Winners Cup and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.\n\nIn 1964 he captained the team in the Scottish Cup Final on 25th April 1964 against Rangers, their last appearance at that stage of the tournament for 39 years.\n\nBobby retired in 1969 after 14 years with club but the association would not stop there for this one club man and through his hosting of the hospitality lounges at Dens he gave the club a loyal service for over 50 years.\n\nBOB SHANKLY \u2013 2010 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nThe second recipient of the Heritage Award was Bob Shankly, manager of what many regard as the greatest team in the club\u2019s history.\n\nHe managed Dundee to their one (and only) League Championship in 1962 then into the European Cup beating the famous names of Cologne, Sporting Lisbon and Anderlecht before falling at the semi-final stage against Italian giants AC Milan. His free scoring side reached the Scottish Cup final in 1964 during a season in which they scored an incredible 141 goals.\n\nShankly once recalled what he looked for in a player \u201cI look for character. I want lads with guts and go, who won\u2019t crumple when things don\u2019t go their way.\u201d No one could argue with his philosophy or how he moulded his team into winners. He let his players express themselves but earned their utmost respect and they rewarded him with the greatest days in the club\u2019s history.\n\nGIORGI NEMSADZE \u2013 2010 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nThe International Award went to Giorgi Nemsadze, a player who had a nomadic existence in Europe before arriving at Dens in 2000. His ability was without question as he had almost 50 caps for his country but as part of the Tayzurri he had his longest stay at any club in his career and that stability brought the best out of him.\n\nThe man with the dancing feet brought joy to the terraces at Dens. He could command a match from the centre of midfield and when he scored they were memorable.\n\nIn November 2000 at Tannadice he linked with Barry Smith and Claudio Caniggia before chipping united keeper Alan Combe. A goal that sent 5,000 Dundee supporters into ecstatic celebration. His goal against Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2003 gave the club their first Scottish Cup final appearance in 39 years. That was a mark of a Dundee Legend \u2013 he always brought joy to Dundee supporters when they watched him. One reporter even commented on his play at Dundee: \u201cThe Georgian\u2019s close control was such that one wondered if he had wiped his boots with glue rather than polish\u201d.\n\nGORDON WALLACE \u2013 2010 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nAsk any Dundee supporter who Gordon Wallace is and you will get the reply: \u201cHe\u2019s the man who scored the winner in Dundee\u2019s League Cup victory over Celtic in December 1973!\u201d And so he did, chesting down a Bobby Wilson free-kick with his back to the goal, turning and, almost all in the one movement, firing the ball past the desperately diving Ally Hunter for one of the best goals ever seen in a Hampden Cup Final.\n\nBorn and bred in the city, Gordon watched Billy Steel make his debut at Dens in 1950 and overcome the setback of being released by Dundee in his early career to make his way into the club\u2019s Hall of Fame.\n\nIn a career laden with goals his 265 League goals was a Scottish record for over 20 years until broken by Ally McCoist. In 1968 he broke an Old Firm monopoly and was awarded the Scottish Writers Player of the Year for almost single-handedly keeping Raith Rovers in Division One with his goals.\n\nHe managed the club in 1989 and won the Scottish League Centenary Cup the following year.\n\nALEX HAMILTON \u2013 2010 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nAlex Hamilton was one of the Scottish game\u2019s great characters both on and off the pitch. Crew cut hairstyle, driving a white jaguar and forming a pop band Hammy and the Hamsters was all show.\n\nSo was his football. Pace, self-confidence and the ability to sell dummies like a salesman in a tailor\u2019s shop made him one of the first overlapping full-backs in the country. He would very soon become the best in the country with 24 full Scottish International caps to prove it. At his peak in 1964, declared himself, Mohammed Ali-style, to be \u201cThe Greatest\u201d right-back in Europe \u2013 a claim not without foundation as that very year he appeared for the Rest of Europe against Scandinavia.\n\nHe formed a formidable full back partnership with lifelong friend Bobby Cox and in 1961-62 Hammy was an ever present in the side that won the Scottish League Championship as he was the following season in the European Cup campaign that saw the Dark Blues reach the semi-final.\n\nAlex made 359 appearances for Dundee in ten seasons, won a club record 24 International caps, 2 International Trial Appearances, 8 Scottish League Caps and most importantly that League Championship medal.\n\nJIM DUFFY \u2013 2010 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nIn 2009 Jim Duffy hosted the first Dundee Hall of Fame Dinner but twelve months later he was himself inducted into the legends of the club for his tremendous service in his various roles as player, coach, assistant-manager and manager in his four spells with the club.\n\nHe was a tremendous centre-half for Dundee and a rock in a Dark Blue jersey and a solid inspiration not just to the fans but also to all around him. Only the wealth of talent in the Scottish defence at the time prevented him from gaining any full international caps. His playing career was cruelly curtailed when a knee injury forced him to give up the game in 1987, just as Dundee looked to be challenging again for honours. Fellow Dundee Legend Gordon Wallace declared upon resuming his playing career in 1989 that if he had retuned earlier the team would not have been relegated.\n\nJim has had two spells as manager at Dens. In his first spell as manager, he led Dundee to the League Cup Final and then to the semi final the following season, a tremendous feat for a First Division side. His second spell at the helm saw him lead Dundee to their first Scottish Cup final since the days of Bob Shankly, capture a top six finish with a fourteen match unbeaten run and lead Dundee into Europe for the first time in twenty-nine years.\n\nTOMMY GALLACHER \u2013 2011 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nTommy Gallacher was inducted into the Hall of Fame with the Heritage Award to mark not only his cultured playing days in the late 1940\u2019s and early 1950\u2019s but for his work in the local newspaper industry.\n\nHis senior career started with Queens Park as his legendary father, Patsy Gallacher, was determined none of his sons would follow him and play for Celtic. After World War II this peerless half-back was in demand and could have signed for Wolves, St Mirren or Aberdeen but chose Dundee. That coincided with one of the greatest eras in the club\u2019s history and the backbone of the legendary Dundee team was Tommy Gallacher, Doug Cowie and Alfie Boyd. It is a half-back line still recited to this day by older Dundee fans. He won the Scottish League Cup in 1951 but the honours list could have been so much longer as that Dundee team missed out on the League Championship on the last day of the 1948/49 season and a Scottish Cup final to Motherwell in 1952.\n\nHis impact on Dundee was not just as part of one of the greatest sides in the club\u2019s history but after his retirement in 1956, he became one of the most respected journalists in the country. During the next 30 years his words became the staple diet of the city\u2019s football support before the internet and wall-to-wall television coverage.\n\nPAT LINEY \u2013 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nPat Liney, the club\u2019s Honorary President became the first ever goalkeeper inducted into the Hall of Fame. In his time at Dens he had the task of replacing one of the country\u2019s best ever keepers in Bill Brown \u2013 a task he accomplished in style being a member of that elite team who won the Scottish League Championship in 1962.\n\nHe is perhaps most remembered by Dundee\u2019s supporters for a crucial penalty save in the penultimate game of the Championship season at home to St Mirren. With only twelve minutes left and Dundee 1-0 up disaster struck when the referee awarded St. Mirren a penalty and Dundee\u2019s chances of winning the League Flag looked like they were over. That is until the keeper parried the spot kick and Dundee went up the park to score again. As they left the pitch the players heard of Rangers\u2019 defeat at Aberdeen and the title was almost there.\n\nFellow Championship team member Bobby Wishart remembers this Legend as someone who fancied himself as a bit of a crooner. At the 40th Anniversary Championship Dinner in 2002 at the Hilton Hotel, he grabbed the microphone and led the assembled Dees in a chorus of, \u2018Hail, Hail, The Dees are Here.\u2019 Legends are made of such stuff!\n\nIAN URE \u2013 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nAnother rock of the Dundee League winning defence was next up to receive his Legends award. Things could have been so different for this Dundee FC hero and bedrock of Dundee\u2019s title winning defence had he followed his first love of rugby and gave in to the early doubts he harboured about his footballing ability.\n\nIan Ure turned his back on his first love, rugby to join Dundee in 1958 and learnt his trade from another Dundee Great, Doug Cowie. In season 1961/62, Dundee become Scottish League Champions and this colossus was an ever present making the number five jersey his own for both club and country. He made the first of eleven international appearances for Scotland, eight of which he won at Dens, in November 1961 against Wales and just three days later was part of the Dundee side which recorded the club\u2019s greatest ever league result, a 5-1 victory over Rangers at Ibrox.\n\nIn December 1962, his superb performances at both home and in the European Cup, saw him presented with the Scottish Footballer of the Year Award, the only Dundee player to win such an accolade. Four months later as he starred in Scotland\u2019s 2-1 win over England at Wembley the B.B.C. commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme described him as \u2018the greatest centre half in the world today\u2019\n\nIt took a then world record fee for a defender of \u00a362,500 to take him away to Arsenal but the memories live long in the minds of the Dundee support.\n\nALAN COUSIN \u2013 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nThroughout his playing career Alan Cousin became a Dundee Legend whilst remaining part-time as he chose to combine his early senior career with a St. Andrews\u2019 University degree course.\n\nSporting mainly the number nine shirt, the striker proved the perfect foil for fellow front man Alan Gilzean and between them proved to be a very effective partnership that shot Dundee not only to the League title but also to the European Cup semis and Scottish Cup Final in subsequent years.\n\nIn over a decade at Dens, he played 384 games putting him comfortably in the top ten of most appearances for The Dee. He sits fourth in Dundee\u2019s all time scorer list with a terrific 141 goals. This loyalty to the club was achieved despite approaches from several clubs when he was widely acclaimed as one of the top forwards in the country.\n\nHe became known as \u2018the King of the Double Shuffle\u2019 with a unique scissors movement that seemed to propel him away from opponents in an instant and he regularly mesmerised teams at both home and abroad.\n\nANDY PENMAN \u2013 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nWhen you enter through the main reception at Dens Park, you are greeted with a picture with the simple caption \u2018The Penalty King\u2019 and inside the frame is a photo of a boy genius of Dundee, Andy Penman, who made his debut at the tender age of fifteen making him the club\u2019s youngest player, won a Championship medal aged just nineteen after scoring the goal which clinched the title.\n\nHe was a wonderful midfield player and contributed a terrific 141 goals as one of only ten players to hit over a century for Dundee and is the club\u2019s fifth top scorer of all time. A dead ball expert, his forte was from the penalty spot where he rarely missed, scoring twenty-five of them in eight years at Dens. He had startling vision and was a fine passer of the ball who could clip balls precisely through, round and over defences to give his forwards clear, unhindered runs at goal. He was a genius, a child prodigy in the art of football.\n\nSadly, Andy died in 1994, aged just fifty-one but his legacy lives on at Dens Park. Not only are you greeted by Andy\u2019s image when you enter the main door but there is also a hospitality lounge that bears his name showing that \u2018Boy Kings\u2019 never grow up and they never die, at least not in the memories of those who were lucky enough to witness the skills and genius of Andy Penman.\n\nTOMMY COYNE \u2013 2011 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nTommy Coyne\u2019s first spell at Dens was short \u2013 barely lasting two years \u2013 but it was certainly illustrious, earning him legendary status in the Hall of Fame.\n\nHe formed a prolific partnership with Keith Wright that produced a goals-to-game ratio barely matched in Dundee\u2019s history. The Cobra and The Mongoose terrorised opposition defences and by the end of their first season, the magnificent attacking football had seen the side score a remarkable 100 goals in all competitions with this legend netting 15 at a strike rate of one goal in less than every two games.\n\nThe Cobra would start his second season in the same way and in September Dundee got revenge for a Scottish Cup semi-final five months earlier when they defeated Dundee United in a pulsating League Cup quarter-final at Dens in front of a capacity 19,724 crowd.\n\nIn November Coyne inflicted more misery on The Arabs when he scored a brace in a 3-1 Derby win at Tannadice as the Dundee fans taunted their rivals by thanking them for giving them their former striker. In his time at Dens he would be a thorn in United\u2019s side scoring five goals, playing in three wins and five draws.\n\nBy the turn of the year he had netted his 30th goal, a magnificent achievement that put him in the running for the U.E.F.A. Golden Boot for Europe\u2019s top league scorer. Ultimately however, Tommy would score thirty-three league goals to finish third and win the Bronze Boot: compensated by going into the record books as the Premier League\u2019s top scorer. In February 1989 he left for Celtic Park, leaving a legacy of 60 goals in only 109 games but would return again in 1999 for a second spell where he helped Dundee to fifth in the SPL \u2013 their joining highest league placing since being Champions of Scotland in 1962.\n\n2012 AWARDS\n\nIn 2012 the club integrated the Hall of Fame event with the 50th Anniversary of its League Championship win in 1962 with a dinner held in the Caird Hall attended by around 700 supporters desperate to recognise the greatest achievement ever by a Dundee team.\n\nIn a marvellous evening of nostalgia, the remaining players from the core of 11 who won the League Championship were inducted into the Hall of Fame with Legends Awards. Bobby Seith, Bobby Wishart and Gordon Smith had all won League titles before they arrived at Dundee and their experience was vital in nurturing the youthful talent abundant at Dens. That talent included winger Hugh Robertson who fittingly was the last name on the team sheet at No. 11 and became the last of the League Legends into the Hall of Fame.\n\nIn the year of Dundee\u2019s 120th anniversary, a further five Legends were inducted at the club\u2019s fifth Hall of Fame dinner at the Invercarse Hotel on Friday 29th March 2013.\n\nHUGH ROBERTSON \u2013 2012 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nHugh Robertson was wonderfully tricky left-winger in his 292 appearances for Dundee and as well as being a key supply line for Dundee\u2019s forwards, contributed 61 goals in his eight years a Dens. A coal miner before joining The Dee from Auchinleck Talbot in 1957, Shug was an ever present in the 1961/62 title winning campaign in which he also won his first full Scottish cap against Czechoslovakia a World Cup play-off match as well as two Under-23 caps. Was part of the side to reach the European Cup semi-final in 1963 and the Scottish Cup Final the following year and would later return to Dens in 1975 as first a coach and then chief scout.\n\nBOBBY SEITH \u2013 2012 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nA cultured and artistic right-half, Bobby Seith won the English League title with Burnley in 1960 before repeating that feat with Dundee two years later as part of the formidable half-back line of Seith, Ure and Wishart. He captained the Scottish League v Scotland during Dundee\u2019s championship season and the following year captained the Dark Blues in both legs of the European Cup semi-final against AC Milan. Made 197 appearances for The Dee, including the 1964 Scottish Cup Final and would later go on to become a coach at Dens Park upon hanging up his boots.\n\nGORDON SMITH \u2013 2012 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nGordon Smith was a hugely important member of Dundee\u2019s 1961/62 title winning squad and is regarded by many as the final piece of the successful jigsaw that manager Bob Shankly pieced together. Smith\u2019s precision play was perfect in aiding the development of young forwards Alan Cousin and Alan Gilzean and Gillie\u2019s prowess in the air was the perfect foil for Smith\u2019s superb crossing ability. He was the pin-up of Scottish Football and the oldest member of the Dundee title winning side at 38 years old and in view of his age, Smith achievements at Dens are extraordinary. In total he played 100 times in three seasons, scoring 19 times and during the championship winning season he played 37 games, bettering that a year later with 48 appearances including a European Cup semi-final appearance at the age of 39. Having already won the League Flag with Hibs and Hearts as well as 32 caps for Scotland during a glittering career, Gordon contributed nine goals in he Dark Blue\u2019s league winning year, including a famous strike in a 4-1 win over Dundee United on his home league debut.\n\nBOBBY WISHART \u2013 2012 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nBobby Wishart was a cultured left-half and a member of the celebrated Dundee half-back line of Bobby Seith, Ian Ure and himself A championship winner with Aberdeen in 1955, he repeated that feat with The Dee after joining from The Dons in January 1961 for a fee of \u00a33,500 which gave him a golden finish to an excellent footballing career. Scored on his debut against Dundee United, Bobby also scored seven times in the Dark Blues\u2019 league winning campaign, including the opening goal of the celebrated season. He played 37 times in the title winning year and in the following European Cup season, played ten games more including being an ever present in the Champions Cup run to the semi-final, scoring a famous goal in the first round 8-1 win over Cologne at Dens.\n\nALFIE BOYD \u2013 2013 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nAlfie Boyd\u2019s induction into the Hall of Fame with a Legends Award comes as the most successful captain in the club\u2019s history and lived the dream that all Dees have by growing up to play for the team he supported as a boy and scoring the winning goal in a cup final for them. He is the captain with the most winners\u2019 medals in the club\u2019s history with two League Cup medals and one Scottish League B Division medal and in the first League Cup win in 1951, he scored a dramatic last minute winner to defeat Rangers 3-2 at Hampden. As part of the famous half-back line of Gallacher, Cowie and Boyd, Alfie made 169 appearances for The Dee which also saw him lead Dundee out in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final and finish as Scottish League Championship runner-up three years before.\n\nBOBBY GLENNIE \u2013 2013 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nBobby Glennie is a Dens Park cult hero who was lucky enough to play for the club he supported as a boy for twelve enjoyable years and relished his Legends Award when he was inducted into the Hall of Fame. As a Dundee player there is arguably no one who was more committed to the cause and he quickly became a fans favourite during his 388 appearances in Dark Blue. In 1980 he had the honour of captaining Dundee in the Bell\u2019s League Cup Final and in the last game of that season, in which he played in every match, he laid on the goal against East Stirlingshire for Eric Sinclair to secure promotion back to the Premier Division. Bobby was also a key member of Dundee\u2019s 1979 First Division title winning team and is also revered for his forty yard screamer against Aberdeen in 1983.\n\nBOBBY WILSON \u2013 2013 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nBobby Wilson\u2019s induction with a Legends Award comes after his eleven years at Dens makes him one of the Club\u2019s longest serving players. In total he made 411 appearances for The Dee which includes a club record seventeen outings in European competition. A right-back very much in the wing back mould, Bobby\u2019s highlight in a Dundee shirt undoubtedly came in the 1973 League Cup Final when he played a key part in the victory as his free kick was controlled by Gordon Wallace who then struck it into the net for the winner. Bobby also played in the 1967 League Cup Final against Celtic, scored in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-final against Leeds United the same season and also scored the winner in the famous UEFA Cup game against Cologne in 1971 when Dundee came back from 4-2 down with twenty minutes to go, to win 5-4.\n\nJACK COWAN \u2013 2013 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Claudio Caniggia and Giorgi Nemsadze, Canadian Jack Cowan is the latest International Award inductee into the Dundee FC Hall of Fame. Cowan was a popular left back who made 149 appearances for The Dark Blues between 1949 and 1954 and was a key member of successful side of that period. In 1951 Jack was part of the team which defeated Rangers in the League Cup Final at Hampden in October and became the first Canadian soccer player to win a major football honour in Europe. Two months later he was named as the North American Football Confederation Player of the Year for 1951 after his terrific displays for Dundee and his League Cup winning achievement and became the first Dundee player to be awarded with any player of the year award outside of the club. Jack also played in the 1952 Scottish Cup Final later that season and was one of the inaugural inductees into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame in May 2000.\n\nGEORGE ANDERSON \u2013 2013 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nGeorge Anderson\u2019s induction with this year\u2019s Heritage Award is as the most successful manager in The Dee\u2019s history who did as more than anyone to shape the major force that Dundee became post-war. His first involvement with the club was as a goalkeeper in the all-conquering 1917/18 wartime Dark Blues which won every competition it entered but he is more fondly remembered as the manager who brought the most silverware to Dens during his eleven years in charge. Becoming managing/director in 1944, he found Dundee in the second tier and as he rebuilt the club from its wartime hiatus, he led them to back to back B Division Championships before being granted promotion to the top tier. Within two years Dundee were runners-up in the Scottish League Championship and after spending a world record fee for Billy Steel in 1950, his \u2018think big, be big\u2019 philosophy paid off as Dundee became the first side to retain the Scottish League Cup in 1951 and 1952 with a Scottish Cup Final appearance sandwiched in between.\n\nBILL BROWN \u2013 2015 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nBill Brown was one of the greatest Scottish goalkeepers of the post-War period and is a legend at Dens Park as a member of the 1951 League Cup winning side. He represented Scotland in the 1958 World Cup as a Dundee player and his legacy at Dens is 274 appearances, making sixty-two shut outs, winning one major trophy, gaining thirteen international caps at various levels and a host of memories of a keeper who was elastically agile, endowed with remarkably sharp reflexes and never less than impeccable for The Dee. Bill went on to achieve legendary status with Spurs in their double winning side of 1960/61 playing 292 times for the London club up to 1966.\n\nJOHN DUNCAN \u2013 2015 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nLocal boy made good John Duncan was one of the privileged few who got to play for the club he loved and repaid that by scoring goals for fun. In a seven year Dens Park career he scored 109 goals in 188 appearances, including forty in season 1972/73 where he finished as Scotland\u2019s top scorer. The following season he was part of the team to win the League Cup against Celtic at Hampden while in European competition he is revered for his hat-trick against Cologne in 1971 in one of the greatest games Dens Park has ever seen. He was signed by Spurs in 1974, where his goal scoring feats continued, scoring 73 goals in 148 appearances over 5 seasons.\n\nSANDY MACFARLANE- 2015 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nA legendary figure in the annals of Dundee FC with a career that spanned over a quarter of a century \u2013 will receive the Heritage Award. He was both a player from 1901 to 1913 and as a manager where he had two spells between the Wars. The clever inside-forward made 333 appearances for Dundee, scoring 71 times and his time at Dens saw him win eight international honours, be a Scottish League Championship runner-up three times and was a key figure in Dundee\u2019s 1910 Scottish Cup win.\n\nJAMES GRADY (GOAL VS. DUNDEE UNITED) \u2013 2015 HALL OF FAME MODERN MOMENT\n\nA new category introduced this year \u2013 was be awarded to the ever popular James Grady. The pint-sized striker etched himself in to Dundee folklore, latching on to a Eddie Annand flick on before producing a stunning half volley that gave Jocky Scott\u2019s Dark Blues a 1-0 victory against Dundee United at Tannadice in November 1998. Playing nearly 100 times for the Dark Blues, he was an integral part of the team that won the Scottish First Division and secured promotion back to the Premier League in season 1997/98.\n\nJULIAN SPERONI \u2013 2015 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nArgentinian keeper travelled up from London especially for the event \u2013 to be presented with the International Award. Signed under freedom of contract from Argentinean side Athletico Platense by Italian manager Ivano Bonetti in the summer of 2001, he quickly established himself as Dundee\u2019s No. 1 and was an ever present the following season under Jim Duffy. He joined Crystal Palace for \u00a3750,000 ten years ago and has remained at Selhurt Park ever since, winning 4 Player of the Year Awards and having a restaurant at the Stadium named in his honour.\n\nBOBBY GEDDES \u2013 2016 SPECIAL RECOGNITION AWARD\n\nGeddes is a member of Paul Hartley\u2019s backroom team and he is a man who knows Dens Park well having been an excellent and popular goalkeeper for eleven years. Having served the Dark Blues with distinction for almost two decades, the Club felt it only right to induct him into the 2016 Hall of Fame with a new category, a Special Recognition Award.\n\nGeddes kept 97 clean sheets in 313 appearances, played in a national cup final, was part of a promotion winning side, won 5 Scotland Under-21 caps, captain Dundee to success in the Tennents Sixes and is the oldest player to play a competitive senior match in Scotland after coming off the bench at Raith in April 2010 aged 49 years and 256 days, almost 30 years after he played for Dundee in the League Cup Final.\n\nJOHN \u2018SAILOR\u2019 HUNTER \u2013 2016 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nJohn \u2018Sailor\u2019 Hunter is a legendary name in the history of Dundee Football Club as the man who scored the winning goal when the Dark Blues first won a major trophy, the Scottish Cup in 1910. Sailor scored four goals en route to lifting the trophy, including the winner against Hibs in the semi-final and was part of the side to finish as Scottish League runners-up by one point the year before.\n\nHunter scored 60 goals in 107 appearances, won one full Scotland cap while at Dens and was top seasonal scorer on two occasions in his three years at Dens and is inducted into the Dundee Hall of Fame with a Heritage Award.\n\nJIMMY TONER \u2013 2016 GOLDEN ERA AWARD\n\nThe 2016 Hall of Fame introduced a new category, the Golden Era Award to recognise the successful post-war period in the Club\u2019s history. In the twenty five or so years after the Second World War Dundee FC won the Scottish League Championship, were the first team to win back to back Scottish League Cups, reached two Scottish Cup Finals and another League Cup Final, were League Championship runners-up, won two Scottish League B Division titles and reached the European Cup and Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-finals; it truly was a golden era. This new award is designed to honour the players whose achievements made it such a special time and the Club were delighted to announce that the first recipient of the Golden Era Award was Jimmy Toner, a member of that wonderful George Anderson side of the early Fifties who won two Scottish League Cups. Dundee were the first side to win back to back League Cups and Toner played in both finals against Rangers and Kilmarnock in 1951 and 1952 in his 71 appearances for the Dark Blues. He is one of only seven players to win two major winners medals with The Dee and returned to coach at Dens between 1966 and 1978.\n\nALLY DONALDSON \u2013 2016 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nAlly Donaldson\u2019s Dark Blue career spanned 14 years over two spells where he amassed 408 appearances for The Dee. He was part of the Dundee side to win the First Division title and promotion in 1979 and won two Scottish League caps and two Scotland Under-23 caps while at Dens.\n\nThe popular keeper played in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup semi-final against Leeds in 1968 and with 126 clean sheets he holds the Club\u2019s clean sheet record and is the fifth goalkeeper to be inducted into the Dundee Hall of Fame after Pat Liney, Bill Brown Julian Speroni and Bobby Geddes.\n\nBILLY PIRIE \u2013 2016 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nBilly Pirie is a goalscoring legend for The Dee who found scoring as natural as breathing. In four years at Dens he scored 106 goals in 138 appearances and his record speaks for itself as a prolific goal getter, not just in Dundee\u2019s history but also in Scottish Football history. His 44 goal haul in his first season with Dundee has yet to be bettered by any player who has followed and helped him win the 1977 Scottish League First Division Player of the Year.\n\nHis 1.3 goals per game ratio did much to alleviate the sense of doom and gloom then prevailing at Dens Park following relegation from the inaugural Premier Division and the memory of him scoring for fun in the First Division lives long in the memory of all who saw him. Part of the 1979 First Division winning side, goals king Billy more than deserves to be inducted into the club\u2019s Hall of Fame with a Legends Award.\n\nNEIL MCCANN \u2013 2016 MODERN HEROES AWARD\n\nNeil McCann came through the youth ranks and Dens and burst onto the scene in the early Nineties where he became the first winner of the Andy De Vries Memorial Trophy as Dundee Player of the Year. He scored the goal which took Dundee to the 1995 League Cup Final with a fantastic strike in the semi against Airdrie and he came out of retirement in 2011 in the Dark Blues\u2019 hour of need to score another sensational goal as a Dee-Fiant hero against Raith Rovers; one of Dens Park\u2019s greatest moments.\n\nThe winger won ten Scotland Under-21 caps while at Dens and those two never-to-be-forgotten strikes were among 12 goals in 97 appearances. Neil McCann is a true modern day hero of Dundee FC and in recognition of everything he achieved with and did for The Dee, the Club are honoured to induct him into the 2016 Hall of Fame with a new Modern Heroes Award.\n\nALEC TROUP \u2013 2017 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nKnown to many fans as \u2018Wee Troupie\u2019 due to his small stature, Alec was a wonderfully tricky winger whose sparkling play, gentlemanly demeanour, good humour and extremely likeable personality undoubtedly brightened up many a troubled heart during the dark days of the First World War and the years that followed. He became a real hero of the people at Dens Park at a time when such role models were in great demand to rouse the population\u2019s spirits as well as being an extremely talented player.\n\nAlec Troup is a Dundee legend and folk hero and the Club were delighted that his grandson Brian Taylor, who himself lives Troup\u2019s native Forfar, was in attendance to accept the 2017 Heritage Award on \u2018Wee Troupie\u2019 behalf\n\nALEX STUART \u2013 2017 GOLDEN ERA AWARD\n\nAlex Stuart won a Scottish League Championship medal with Dundee at the tender age of 21, played in the European Cup semi-final and had the honour of captaining Dundee in the 1967 League Cup Final. An accomplished defender, Stuart was famed for his powerful shooting and in his nine seasons in the first team, he scored a very credible 31 goals making him the highest scoring defender in the Club\u2019s history to date.\n\nAlex Stuart enjoyed a memorable eleven years at Dens Park when Dundee were at the height of their glory and was the only member of the league winning squad to play in both the Scottish and League Cup Finals. He was the last of the Championship side to leave Dens Park and his departure marked the end of a golden age for Dundee F.C.\n\nTHOMSON ALLAN \u2013 2017 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nDundee have had a fine tradition of good goalkeepers over the years and Thomson Allan certainly fits into that category, winning the Scottish League Cup in 1973 and going to the World Cup in West Germany with Scotland the following year. He was confidence personified and inspired his team mates with his immaculate handling and wonderful ability to cut out cross balls and is one of the best keepers to have worn the number one shirt for Dundee.\n\nThe consistent, reliable and agile keeper is fondly remembered by Dundee supporters who were lucky enough to see him and he came out with the most number of votes in a fans\u2019 favourite goalkeeper online poll on Dundee\u2019s official site in 2009 and is now voted into the Hall of Fame by the supporters\n\nKEITH WRIGHT \u2013 2017 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nFor Dundee fans everywhere a mongoose is so much more than a small predatory mammal from Africa, chiefly known for its distinctive long tail. Rather it is a bona fide legend, famed for predatory goal scoring exploits while wearing a distinctive dark blue shirt, namely Keith Wright. Signed from Raith Rovers in 1986, Wright was part of two successful goal scoring partnerships in his time at Dens but became a legend in his own right when he scored a hat-trick in a memorable derby win over Dundee United in 1989.\n\nWright scored 75 goals in 197 appearances, won the Tennents Sixes and the Centenary Cup and was the last Dundee player to represent the Scottish League in 1990 and his goals against United will live long in the memory.\n\nROBERT DOUGLAS \u2013 2017 MODERN HEROES AWARD\n\nThe Club introduced the Modern Heroes Award to recognise the contribution of a player or manager from the Nineties onwards and Robert Douglas is a player who earned legendary status across the three decades that this award covers.\n\nWith 98 clean sheets in 303 appearances, Douglas is a Dark Blue goalkeeping great and as big a Dundee hero as you\u2019ll meet. He won the First Division in 1998 and the Player of the Year an unprecedented three times before becoming a Dee-Fiant in his second spell at Dens.\n\nRobert Douglas has a special place in the hearts of many of the supporters who saw him play for their club and country and now that he has finally hung up those big gloves, Scottish Football is a sadder place.\n\nDAVID \u2018NAPPER\u2019 THOMSON \u2013 2018 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nDavid Thomson was a pre-war Dark Blue stalwart making 385 appearances over a fourteen year period with Dundee FC, his only senior club. Nicknamed \u2018Napper\u2019 because of his cool, collective approach, he played for Dundee in the 1925 Scottish Cup Final and earned one full cap and two Scottish League caps during a distinguished Dens Park career.\n\nBOBBY FLAVELL \u2013 2018 GOLDEN ERA AWARD\n\nTo score a goal in a winning cup final for Dundee is pretty special but to do it twice is incredible and only one man has achieved this tremendous feat, Bobby Flavell. When Dundee became the first side to win back to back League Cups in 1951 and 1952, Flavell wrote himself into the Dark Blue history books by scoring in both victorious finals and the forward scored 53 goals in 98 appearances, striking up a famous partnership with 2009 inductee Billy Steel.\n\nCAMMY FRASER \u2013 2018 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nHailing from Fintry, Cammy Fraser is \u2018one of our own\u2019 and an inspirational captain from the early eighties. He joined Dundee in September 1980 when they were bottom of the First Division and by the end of the season his drive and attacking midfield flair helped Dundee win promotion and to a national cup final after scoring the winner in the League Cup quarter-final away at Premier League champions Aberdeen and a vital equaliser in the semi against Ayr. He also played his part in the First Division title winning campaign in his second spell in 1992 and was a terrific player who gave his all every time he pulled on a dark blue shirt.\n\nERIC SINCLAIR \u2013 2018 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nEric Sinclair was a player who was wholeheartedly committed to the cause, played for the jersey and who enhanced his reputation and popularity when he scored the goal which returned Dundee to the Premier Division in May 1981. The tall, blond, predatory striker never gave anything less than 100% during games and was a regular goal getter for The Dee, netting 95 times in 289 appearances and finishing as top goal in two different seasons. He won the SPFA First Division Player of the Year in 1980/81 when his 22 goals helped Dundee into the top flight and was capped by the Scottish League when he scored against the English League. Sinky\u2019s speciality was shielding the ball with his back to goal and he was also part of the Dundee side which won the 1979 First Division title and played in the 1980 League Cup Final. Eric also scored in the famous 5-1 win over Celtic in April 1980 and to cap it off scored the only goal against Dundee United earlier the same season; the second time he had scored a winner in the derby.\n\nGAVIN RAE \u2013 2018 MODERN HERO AWARD\n\nGavin Rae truly is a Dark Blue Modern Hero who enjoyed three spells at Dens between 1994 and 2014. He became the 21st player in 120 years to reach his third century of games for the club just before lifting the Championship trophy as skipper in May 2014 and his time at Dens also saw him win the First Division, play in the Scottish Cup Final, score in the U.E.F.A. Cup and become Dundee\u2019s first Scottish internationalist in fifteen years. Starting and finishing his career at Dens Park, Gavin scored 32 times in 302 appearances and gave his all every time he pulled on the famous dark blue.\n\nALBERT JULIUSSEN \u2013 2019 HERITAGE AWARD\n\nAlbert Juliussen was a real \u2018Roy of the Rovers\u2019 post war hero to the Dundee support when he scored an incredible 95 goals in 73 competitive games (plus another 33 goals in Forfarshire Cup, Dewar Shield and friendly matches) and was top scorer for The Dee for three years in a row from 1945/46 to 1947/48. He was part of a free scoring Dundee side which won back to back Scottish League B Division championships and has the best goal ratio of any Dundee striker who has played more than 20 goals for the club with an average of 1.3 goals per game. Juliussen was a goal scoring machine in his time in Dark Blue and his seven goals against Dunfermline is a joint club record (with Alan Gilzean) for most goals in one match. He brought hope and joy to a war weary Dundee footballing public who were grateful for the goals that fired Dundee back into the big time and the club were honoured to have his son Laurence in attendance to accept his Heritage Award on his behalf.\n\nTOSH McKINLAY \u2013 2019 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nTosh McKinlay was a wonderfully, classy left-back with attacking flair who served Dundee with distinction in his 204 appearances. He scored nine goals in a Dark Blue shirt and none is more fondly remembered than his stunning goal in a famous derby win over Dundee United at Tannadice in 1984 for which Dundee fans are forever grateful. His record in the derby of seven wins and six draws help cement his Dark Blue popularity and the Dundee fans were proud to see him go on and represent Scotland at both Euro 96 and France 98 after leaving Dens.\n\nGEORGE STEWART \u2013 2019 LEGENDS AWARD\n\nGeorge Stewart\u2019s 12 year career at Dens Park saw him play in a European semi-final, ten domestic semi-finals and two national cup finals and pick up winners\u2019 medal as part of the Dundee side which won the Scottish League Cup in 1973. Powerful in the air with a good touch on the ground, Stewart had been a popular character in both the dressing room and on the terracing is part of the last Dundee side to win a major trophy. He talks with pride of his 292 appearances for The Dee and deservedly entered the Dundee FC Hall of Fame, joining five of his team mates from that iconic 1973 side, one of whom Gordon Wallace, presented him with his award.\n\nDARIUSZ ADAMCZUK \u2013 2019 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nDariusz Adamczuk was a cult hero to the Dundee support during the Nineties when he arrived for a club record fee, left 11 games later for another club record fee, returned to Dens three years later to help Dundee win the First Division and then was part of the side which secured the Dark Blues\u2019 highest ever Premier Division finish. While at Dens Dariusz was capped four times by Poland and won the Dundee FC Player of the Year in 1999. His two spells at Dens Park were his most successful in his career and were as enjoyable for player and fans alike. He is a modern day Dundee FC hero who gave his all every time he pulled on the Dark Blue.\n\nMORTEN WEIGHORST \u2013 2019 INTERNATIONAL AWARD\n\nMorten Weighorst was a hero for both his club Dundee and his country Denmark and while a player from a Scottish First Division side winning an international tournament with a top five FIFA ranked side may seem unlikely, that is exactly what Morten Weighorst did in 1995 the Danes won the King Fahd Cup (renamed the Confederations Cup in 1997). That same year Morten was a vital cog in the Dundee side that reached the Coca-Cola Cup Final and in the quarters against Hearts at Dens, scored a stunning strike to make it 4-4 in extra time before slotting home the winning penalty. A popular player at Dens, Morten was hugely influential in the Dark Blue midfield with his craft, surging runs and an eye for goal, and the week before the League Cup Final at Hampden scored the winning goal in a derby at Tannnadice. Legends are made of such stuff.\n\n\u201cHonouring the past, inspiring the future\u201d, these inductees are worthy entrants into the Dundee FC Hall of Fame and represent all that is great about this wonderful club."}, {"url": "http://www.margatefootballclubhistory.com/billbrown.shtml", "page_content": "Bill Brown\n\n*Indicates unconfirmed information.

Bill was especially strong in the air and he scored his first goal for Margate on 8.11.69 during a 2-1 defeat at Hillingdon. It was a spectacular strike - a scissor kick that the local paper said \"ripped into the roof of the net with such velocity that the netting required immediate repairs\".\n\nOn 15.11.69 Bill was in the Margate side that were thrashed 7-2 by visitors Aldershot in the FA Cup 1st Round but he struggled for form after that and only played three more first team games, scoring in the last of them - a 3-1 defeat at Hillingdon on 20.12.69.

His time at the Liberty was a great success and he scored a number of stunning goals, including a brace at Wembley in the League Cup final win, plus a call up to the Dutch national team. But after two loan seasons at the club, he moved to Napoli. He currently plays for German side Eintract Frankfurt. He was a part of the Dutch squad for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\n\nDORUS DE VRIES\n\nDorus began his career in his native Holland with Telstar before joining ADO Den Haag. After a successful time with the club he moved to Scotland, signing for Dunfermline Athletic where he played in the Scottish Cup final against Celtic alongside another future Swan, Jason Scotland. His contract ended in the summer of 2007 and he opted to join Swansea alongside another former team-mate, Ferrie Bodde. In his first season at the club he helped the Swans gain promotion from League One and in the club\u2019s first season back in the Championship he kept a club-record 22 clean sheets, winning the Football League\u2019s Golden Glove award in the process. The following season saw Dorus play in the victorious Wembley win over Reading to reach the Premier League for the first time, but the goalkeeper surprisingly opted to sign for fellow top-flight side Wolves instead after 203 appearances.

Locally born, he was a trainee at the Vetch Field and signed professional in July 1999, making his League debut in Swansea's 1-0 victory at Leyton Orient five months later. He made his Welsh U-21 debut against Armenia in August 2001 but failed to secure a regular first-team slot with Swansea and had loan spells at Merthyr Tydfil and Llanelli to gain match practice. Making 23 League appearances for the Swans before moving to Carmarthen Town in January 2003, he has also played for Port Talbot.\n\nJOHN DEWSBURY\n\nYoung full-back John Dewsbury briefly played alongside Gilbert Beech in Swansea's defence. Locally born, he progressed through the ranks at the Vetch Field and turned professional in April 1950. He made his League debut in Swansea's 2-2 draw at home to Everton in October 1952 and played nine consecutive Second Division games in place of Steve Leavy. Helping the Swans win the West Wales Senior Cup in 1954, he followed Billy Lucas to Newport County in August 1955 and later played for Milford United.\n\nYAN DHANDA\n\nDudley-born Dhanda joined Swansea on a free transfer in May 2018 signing a four year deal. He enjoyed a memorable senior debut scoring the winning goal against Sheffield United just 29 seconds after being introduced off the bench on the opening day of the season. He made a further five first team appearances during that campaign. In his four years at the club, he made a total of 63 appearances and scored four goals. He left the club at the conclusion of his deal in July 2022.\n\nSTEPHEN DOBBIE\n\nThe Glasgow-born striker began his career at Scottish giants Rangers, but after finding his playing time restricted he moved to Hibernian, before joining St Johnstone and then Queen of the South. After impressing north of the border, Dobbie joined Swansea on a free transfer in the summer of 2009 under the guidance of Paulo Sousa. He had excellent technique and a wonderful football brain, impressing the most during the 2010-11 season. He scored the third goal in that memorable play-off final win over Reading at Wembley and featured for the Swans in their opening Premier League clash against Manchester City the following August. After a loan spell back at former club Blackpool, Dobbie was reunited with Ian Holloway at Crystal Palace, helping the Eagles reach the top flight before loan spells at Blackpool. He made 62 appearances (31 as sub) for the Swans with 17 goals.\n\nTOMMY DODDS\n\nVersatile inside-forward Tommy Dodds appeared for Swansea during the early post-war era. Initially with Hebburn St Cuthberts, he moved via North Shields to Aston Villa in January 1939 and featured in their first post-war League match against Middlesbrough in August 1946. He joined Swansea as part of the Trevor Ford deal in January 1947 and scored twice in 11 League outings while at the Vetch Field before returning to North Shields in August 1948. Moving to Barry Town in January 1949, he then played for Hereford United and settled back in his native North-East, residing in South Shields until his death in April 1998.\n\nDAVE DODSON\n\nEx-England Youth winger Dave Dodson scored in Swansea's 1960 West Wales Senior Cup final success. Signing professional for Arsenal in November 1957, he failed to secure a first-team slot at Highbury and joined Swansea in July 1959. He made his League debut in the following month's 2-1 victory at home to Lincoln City and netted 11 goals in 30 Second Division games before being sold to Portsmouth for \u00a34,000 in December 1961. Helping them clinch the Third Division title that season, he joined Aldershot in January 1965, then played for Hereford, Guildford, Andover and Fleet.\n\nPETER DONNELLY\n\nInside-forward Peter Donnelly played for Swansea during the 1961-62 campaign. Signing professional for Doncaster Rovers in March 1954, he scored on his League debut the following month. He moved to Scunthorpe United in July 1958 and was leading marksman in 1959-60, joining Cardiff City in exchange for Joe Bonson in June 1960. Trevor Morris paid \u00a36,500 for him in October 1961 and he netted three goals in 16 Second Division games for Swansea before being sold to Brighton for \u00a37,000 in July 1962. He topped their goalscoring charts in 1962-63 and later played for Bradford City, Margate and Canterbury City.\n\nSCOTT DONNELLY\n\nA strong, forceful midfielder who began his career at QPR before moving to Aldershot Town in the hope of finding first-team football. Scott was a regular goalscorer from midfield for the Shots, earning himself a move to the Liberty in June 2010. However, the competition for places was evidently intense under Brendan Rodgers and after 18 months at the club he had made just one substitute appearance in the league and one start in the cup. After a loan spell at Wycombe, Donnelly moved to the club on a permanent basis, before spells at Aldershot, Southend and Newport County. He featured for County at Wembley in their victorious Conference play-off win over Wrexham before joining Farnborough and Havant.\n\nFRANK DONOVAN\n\nEx-Welsh Amateur international outside-right Frank Donovan played for Swansea during the 1950-51 season. He developed with Milford United and Haverfordwest, then skippered Pembroke Borough to promotion in 1947-48 and was selected for the 1948 Great Britain Olympic squad. Moving to the Vetch Field in May 1950, he scored twice in 15 Second Division games for Swansea prior to re-joining Pembroke in July 1951.

He revived his career with Garden Village before re-joining Winch Wen.\n\nDEREK DRAPER\n\nWelsh U-23 inside-forward Derek Draper was an influential figure in Swansea's 1963-64 FA Cup run. Locally born, he turned professional at the Vetch Field in May 1962 and netted ten goals in 61 League games for Swansea before being sold to Derby County for \u00a35,000 in April 1966. He joined Bradford PA in September 1967 and moved to Chester in January 1969. Leading marksman in 1972-73, he starred as they won promotion and were League Cup semi-finalists in 1974-75.\n\nDARYL DUFFY\n\nThe Scotland Under-21 international arrived in English football from Falkirk in January 2006, signing for Hull City after netting 27 goals in 65 starts north of the border. Duffy signed on loan for the Swans from Hull in February 2007 season, scoring five goals in five starts. This form prompted boss Roberto Martinez to make Duffy\u2019s move permanent, with the striker going on to help the club win promotion from League One in 2008 before joining Bristol Rovers, Cheltenham and Salgaocar in Goa after 40 appearances (18 as sub) and seven goals.\n\nRICHARD DUFFY\n\nTeenage defender Richard Duff"}, {"url": "https://www.sportsbroadcastjournal.com/bill-brown-after-30-years-with-the-astros-i-thought-it-was-time-before-fans-get-critical/", "page_content": "Not many non ex ballplayers start their broadcast careers right in the big leagues. Bill Brown did and spent 30 fulltime seasons with the Houston Astros after seven years working Cincinnati Reds TV .\n\nAmong the microphone men in major league parks today, most folks paid their minor league dues, some for a shorter time and others longer. They include Marty Brennaman, Ken Korach, John Rooney, Tom McCarthy, Dave Van Horne, Terry Smith, Andy Freed, Rick Rizzs, Joe Davis, Dave Femming and Matt Hicks. Brown\u2019s circumstances didn\u2019t permit it.\n\nIf we examined the entire roster of MLB announcers, we would see lots more who did the bus grind in either or both the top and lower minors. Those who didn\u2019t will likely admit that the learning curve was littered with unevenness or rust.\n\nBallplayers are exceptions. Their early work might be choppy, yet they bring a depth of knowledge that generally surpasses the professionally trained broadcaster. The best to transition from the field to the play-by-play booth include Don Drysdale, Ernie Johnson Sr., Rick Monday, Mike Shannon, Buddy Blattner, Phil Rizzuto, Geogre Kell, Bob Uecker, Mike Krukow, Herb Score and Duane Kuiper. If we looked under the hood, we would likely identify more.\n\nDuring his young adulthood, years when others were in the minors honing their play-by-play skills, Bill Brown was in Vietnam. A communications major at Missouri, he did play-by-play for the school station. But after college and a short stay in San Antonio where he cut his teeth on commercial television, Uncle Sam called. Bill was off to Vietnam where 58,000 Americans were killed. Lucky for Bill though and we talk about it in our Q&A, he was assigned there to do radio and TV for the troops. (Mel Allen and Lindsey Nelson did similar communications work in World War II.)\n\nAfter he was back on American soil, Brown wound up in Cincinnati where he did studio work for WLWT-TV before delving into play-by-play.\n\nUnlike other announcers, Brown recognized when it\u2019s time to turn off the mic. There are not many who do. \u2018My wife will tell me when I\u2019m not as sharp,\u2019 is a refrain which is no more than an excuse to stay on \u2013 just when the memory begins to lapse, word retention weakens and information retrieval isn\u2019t quite at the tip of the tongue.\n\nThe legendary Cawood Ledford, who called the Kentucky Wildcat games for eons got out when he felt it was time. He didn\u2019t want to hear that fans were talking about him, saying Cawood is losing it. He picked himself up on his own accord and took retirement. Brown did the same. He left (albeit he does some promotional work for the club and occasional on-air fill-in).\n\nIn all, Brown spent 37 fulltime seasons on television .Ten of those seasons he did radio too. He retired from fulltime play-by-play in 2016.\n\n***\n\nServing in Vietnam, as you did, is a challenging transition to adulthood. Back in 1971 in Saigon, before the magic of instantaneous worldwide communication, you gave the troops in Vietnam a touch of home, providing scores and sports news on military radio and television. The Vietnam experience for you transcended sportscasting. What was it like?\n\nWe used to joke in the Army about troops being assigned to jobs not even close to what they were trained to do, but for some reason this time, it worked in my favor and I was really grateful to be able to do what I always wanted to do \u2013 broadcast sports. We had all the creature comforts any Specialist 4 could ever hope for in Vietnam \u2013 housing in a hotel, bus transportation to work and security. It didn\u2019t seem like being in Vietnam at all. We read the sports stories on the AP and UPI wires, rewrote them into our scripts and went on the air. We worked 12-hour shifts every day.\n\nYour first baseball play-by-play gig was in Cincinnati. You were a TV anchor but had never done major or even minor league ball. How did you get your reps and your experience, to enable you to start right in the big leagues with the Reds?\n\nI knew play-by-play was coming. So I went to every game when the team was in town and found an empty broadcast booth; used game notes and score sheets to create a simulated broadcast to work on the craft. I kept thinking about all the great experiences minor league broadcasters were getting every night and how I was competing with them for jobs in the future. Practicing at the big ballpark was the best I could do.\n\nAfter seven seasons with the Reds (1972-82), your career took another direction. You eventually headed out west and were away from day-to-day baseball until you ran into Dick Wagner, then general manager in Houston. Wagner, of course, worked in Cincinnati beforehand while you were there. He hired you to broadcast Astros games in 1987 where you spent 30 years in the booth. You arrived in Houston after the team\u2019s original voice, Gene Elston, left. He was the first voice of the Astros and was embedded in the community. Any challenges being accepted in Houston?\n\nI thought people would be hopping mad that Gene was no longer in the booth and would not accept a guy they had never heard of as his replacement. In my mind I created a problem that probably wasn\u2019t so much of an issue; but for the first few years it was not a comfortable feeling.\n\nWagner helped build the Big Red Machine and later strengthened the Astros. He also had worked in small market radio. How did he treat you?\n\nHe carefully checked out people before hiring them. He had been a radio station owner in Nebraska who paid a lot of attention to broadcasting and broadcasters. He counseled me to ask short interview questions like Jack Buck. Dick was always looking for bargains in the broadcast booth rather than hiring expensive big names. I was fortunate to be an easy mark for a low salary when it came to realizing my dream.\n\nDo you have any sense of what it was like for Gene Elston when Milo Hamilton arrived in 1985? Milo had somewhat of an overpowering personality. Gene was more restrained. The two were together a couple seasons. Did Gene feel threatened?\n\nI would be guessing, but from what I heard they kept each other at arm\u2019s length. Gene actually made out the announcers\u2019 schedules, so he had control of when he worked on radio and when he was on TV. He and Milo were not on the air in the same booth. Geno might do radio one day and Milo would be on TV that day, so they did not have to interact that much. Apparently, they didn\u2019t.\n\nOf the Astros\u2019 announcers, you\u2019ve had the longest tenure to date, 30 seasons! Milo was there 27 years, and Elston, 25. You\u2019re talented, of course. Yet, what\u2019s the secret to survival as a big-league announcer?\n\nUnderstanding that you are an employee is very important. Some broadcasters become tremendously popular with fans and they allow themselves to think they\u2019re more important than anyone in the front office. That can be the kiss of death.\n\nYou grew up in Missouri a fan of Jack Buck. You told me you would often think to yourself, \u201cAm I trying to sound too much like him?\u201d What made Buck special and why did you look up to him more than Harry Caray who was the Cards\u2019 lead announcer? Buck was his number #2 for many years.\n\nI went to a game in St. Louis with my transistor radio. Harry Caray was doing play-by-play. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s a hot smash to Ken Boyer at third\u2026\u201d as he often did. What my eyes saw was a routine two-hop ground ball not hit very hard. Harry lost all credibility with me on that play. Harry built drama as well as any broadcaster, but accuracy sometimes suffered. Jack was more intent to be a reporter and was more accurate. The broadcast was not about Jack. It was about what happened on the field. I loved his lack of ego.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Milo Hamilton can be a difficult boothmate. He had uneasy relationships with other announcers, notably Harry Caray. What made him difficult and did you have problems working with him?\n\nI did not experience problems with Milo. He did not see me as a threat to his job. He was a Ford Frick Award winner in 1992, and after winning the highest award for a baseball broadcaster he had no worries. He was keyed very high and had a healthy ego. It\u2019s my opinion that the egos in the booth can be every bit as large as they are on the field. In the final result, few of the listeners/viewers know or care about that. The broadcaster\u2019s resume should be his body of work on the air. That\u2019s not to excuse anybody from not being a good citizen, of course.\n\nYou left the Astros on you own accord and by your own initiative. You wanted to retire and transition to new opportunities at an age when you still had work years ahead of you. Why?\n\nIn my opinion, my performance on the air was slipping. Management was terrific and held my letter of resignation for two days, asking if I wanted to reconsider before it acted on it. But I had thought it through and was certain it was the right move. It was always my opinion that many broadcasters stayed on the job too long. Fans are forgiving and they do usually give an old broadcaster a \u201cpass\u201d when he makes an obvious mistake. I really couldn\u2019t live with it and was not willing to keep going further down that road. When I was 30, I used to look at all the announcers in their 70s and wonder why they hadn\u2019t had enough. When I got there,68, I realized how blessed I was to have many years on the job and thought the team would be better served with someone more proficient and more passionate. I could feel that some of my passion had exited, and that meant it was time for me to exit. Fortunately, the team asked me to stay on as a part time employee. If not, I planned to play some golf, do some volunteer work and travel with my wife. We have three grandchildren, and we love spending time with them.\n\nYou\u2019ll hear some of the older guys say, \u201cI\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time\u201d or \u201cMy wife will tell me when I\u2019m beginning to lose my sharpness.\u201d Are these announcers just looking for excuses? Word retention, word retrieval and eyesight all generally weaken over time.\n\nYes, frequently they do not know when it\u2019s time. People are talking about them, and it\u2019s not complimentary. I experienced decline in all those areas you mention. Also, I mentioned in a little press conference at the retirement announcement that I felt as if I was on a high-speed train going through a tunnel, with images of many games and memories flashing past too quickly to enjoy them. For me, it was time to try to slow down the passing of time with more time to savor it.\n\nAt one point, I asked you about Vin Scully. You unhesitatingly chuckled and said, \u201cVin\u2019s on another planet.\u201d You won\u2019t get an argument from anyone in their right mind. Yet, why so?\n\nHe\u2019s not the ONLY broadcaster who would reference an opera or Broadway show or literary work on a baseball broadcast, but with anybody else it would be forced to create attention to his genius. He avoided clich\u00e9s as well as anybody. He told countless stories about the players from his unquenchable preparation and made baseball broadcasts learning experiences."}, {"url": "https://www.spursodyssey.com/0405/brown.html", "page_content": "Spurs Odyssey was very saddened to hear this week of the death of another Spurs Legend - Double goalkeeper, Bill Brown. (1st December, 2004) Bill had spent many years living in Canada, after he ended his playing days in Toronto. The Spurs and Scotland legend had been unable to travel to England for the Double Reunion dinner in 2001, and also was not well enough to make it to White Hart Lane for the induction of Bill Nicholson and all the Double side into the Spurs Hall of Fame in March this year.\n\nPlayers from both Spurs and Liverpool wore black armbands in last night's Carling Cup quarter-final, but it is unfortunate that the club seems to have set a precedent by not holding a one-minute silence for one of the true Spurs' greats. Bill left the club in 1966, having been superceded by a young Pat Jennings, who was a fitting successor to a great goalie.\n\nHere is an extract from Brian Judson's excellent introduction to the Double series on Spurs Odyssey:-\n\nBill Brown was a very unflashy goalkeeper who just got on with the business of playing football instead of playing to the gallery like some goalkeepers do. Born in 1931, Brown played his first football for junior teams in Scotland before joining Dundee. In 1959, Nicholson signed Brown from Dundee for what seems a paltry sum of money these days but was then an enormous amount. Brown brought confidence to the defence for the first time since the heyday of Ted Ditchburn. Brown was rarely absent from the team until he left for Northampton Town in 1966 but in his last two seasons with Tottenham, he was encouraging the very young Pat Jennings, who had been signed from Watford. Brown only missed two games during 1960-61. After ending his career at Northampton, Brown emigrated to Canada, where he worked in property development for many years.\n\nThus, a third former player enters the \"Great Double Team in the Sky\" along with John White and Danny Blanchflower, where they have been joined recently by the much-loved and much-missed Bill Nicholson, who no doubt will be keeping a fond eye on them all.\n\nFollow @spursodyssey\n\nTop of page | Index to 2004-5 Matches & Reports"}, {"url": "https://football-talk.co.uk/182879/who-am-i-guess-the-footballer-based-on-their-transfer-history/", "page_content": "Welcome to \u201cWho Am I?\u201d, the guessing game that challenges your knowledge of footballers and their transfer histories.

Shortly after making my international debut, I was signed by Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson\u2019s Sampdoria.

Made his debut as a substitute in the 3-3 draw at Weymouth and the 19-year went on to make two uneventful starts in a City shirt. Then headed back from where he came. Spent time on loan at Bashley and Swindon Supermarine during the 2004-05 season. Joined Team Bath in October 2005.\n\nBernard Adams 1 0 Played for City during the 1921-22 season.\n\nGeorge Adams 21 7 George moved to City from Leyton Orient in July 1950 having previously played for Chelmsford City. The Falkirk born wing-half played for Crystal Palace later in his career.\n\nMike Adams 175 22 Attacking midfielder Micky was signed from Bristol Rovers toward the end of the 1983-84 season by Bobby Jones and became a regular in the City side for the next four seasons. A frequent goalscorer he was best remembered for his injury-time winner, scored with his knee, against Aylesbury United in the FA Cup to set up the famous Bristol City matches in 1986. However, his failure to register even a single goal during the 1987-88 season contributed to City\u2019s relegation and saw him released by new manager Harold Jarman. Went on to play for Weston Super Mare and Keynsham Town.\n\nReg Adams 179 0 A goalkeeper signed from Chippenham Town following the First World War. After six seasons with the club he retired in 1925.\n\nPaul Adcock 129 41 Plymouth-born striker Paul\u2019s City career began in spectacular style with a debut day hat-trick against Macclesfield Town in August 1993. He ended that season as top scorer with 23 goals and continued this form in the early stages of the next campaign. However, regular injury and suspension problems contributed to a loss of form and he struggled to recapture this start. Despite this Paul earned a three-month contract with Torquay United in the summer of 1996. When this was not extended he briefly returned to City (5 games 1 goal) before joining Gloucester City in November 1996. Also played for Weymouth and most recently South Western League side Tavistock.\n\nDavid Adekola 9 3 Despite making just nine appearances for City \u2018Pepsi\u2019 or \u2018Prince\u2019 Adekola is a name that remains etched on many City fans minds. It was a major coup when Tony Ricketts obtained his services just before the 1995 transfer deadline as the striker had played top division football in both France and Belgium as well as scoring 14 goals in just 22 appearance for Nigeria. His performances for City seemed to support this pedigree and Ricketts made, ultimately unsuccessful, attempts to keep him at Twerton Park during the summer of 1995. However, many years later it was revealed that this whole background may have never actually happened! What is true is that he played for Bury between 1992 and 1994 and is remembered as a legend there, and also had brief spells with Oldham, Hereford, Cambridge United, Bishop\u2019s Stortford and Brighton.\n\n????

Moved onto York City then had a spell in Hong Kong from where he joined City in 1982. He left almost immediately to join AFC Bournemouth but after one game was back at Twerton Park. Made over 100 appearances before quitting for Trowbridge Town at the end of the 1984-85 season. Spent three seasons at Frome Road, where he also began coaching, then moved onto Forest Green Rovers. His second spell lasted just six months and nine games in 1988. Was back again as assistant to Tony Ricketts in the summer of 1991 but cost cutting measures before the end of that season saw him leave the club. Now back at Rovers as their Community Scheme Organiser.\n\nE Alden 17 7 Played for City for two seasons between 1926 and 1928.\n\nW Alden 16 4 Played for City during the 1908-09 season, netting on four occasions.\n\nW Allan n/a 2 Played for City during the 1904-05 season.\n\nBertie Allen 18 3 Bertie played for City during the 1948-49 season before joining Chippenham United.\n\nBertie Allen n/a 2 A young striker from Peasdown, Bertie scored on his debut against Bromsgrove Rovers in November 1972 and his first league start a month later but failed to fulfil this early promise.

He went on to make over 200 appearances for the club before joining Trowbridge Town in July 1971.\n\nKenny Allen 289 0 As part of City\u2019s 1978 Southern League championship winners side Kenny is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers to ever pull on a City shirt. The 6\u20194 shot-stopper arrived at Twerton Park from Torquay United in 1973 and made 280 appearances in the next five years before a surprise move to Bournemouth for \u00a36000 took him back into league football. Spent five seasons with the South Coast club and then had spells with Peterborough, Bury, Swindon Town and, once again, Torquay. It was from the Gulls that he rejoined City in July 1988 but after just nine games he broke his leg conceding a penalty against Dorchester. Was released when he regained fitness early in 1989 and returned to Torquay where he made his last appearance at Wembley in the 1989 LDV Vans Trophy Final.\n\nTom Allen 69 38 Thomas was an inside-forward who played 69 games for City, scoring 38 goals, in two spells with the club before the First World War. In-between these two stints he spent a season with Bristol City but only made one first team appearance.\n\nMalcolm Allison 2 0 The word most commonly associated with Malcolm is \u2018flamboyant\u2019 and even in his early managerial career with City there were signs of this approach. As a player he made nearly 250 appearances for West Ham United before illness brought his professional career to a premature end. He did turn out for Romford after this and played two games for City during his one season with the club. Of course, it was a manager he is most well-know and he began at Twerton Park in 1963, leading the club to a 3rd place finish in the Southern League and an appearance in the 3rd Round of the FA Cup, plus introducing full-time training and the sweeper system. At the end of that season he left to join Plymouth Argyle before going on to manage Manchester City, Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough. He also managed overseas, in Turkey with Galatasaray (1976-1977), and in Portugal with Sporting. With the Lisbon club he won the championship title, and the Portuguese Cup, in 1981-1982.\n\nSam Allison 56 8 Undoubtedly talented but never consistent pacy forward Sam had two spells with City. Burst onto the scene with five goals in eight reserve team games at the start of the 2000-01 season. Made over 40 first team appearances after this, although just 16 in the starting line-up. Following a falling out with manager Alan Pridham he joined Clevedon Town in October 2001 for \u00a3500. Returned to Twerton Park at the beginning of the next season but only added one further start and three substitute outings to his tally. Following his release at the end of that season played for Salisbury City and Paulton Rovers before joining Chippenham Town in December 2003.\n\nSimeon Allison 3 1 Younger cousin of Sam Allison, Simeon\u2019s career with City followed a similar path without ever quite making the step up to the first team. Was a regular in the reserve side before switching to Clevedon Town in December 2001. Was back with City again the following year but only made one substitute appearance. Joined Frome Town in July 2005.\n\nGil Alsop 67 47 A regular reserve team player, Gil made the step up to the first team squad during the late 1920\u2019s. His goalscoring feats began to attract the attention of a host of league clubs during the 1929-30 season, with scouts from Sheffield Wednesday, Crystal Palace and Bristol City all watching City\u2019s 7-1 FA Cup win over Garrards Athletic, in which Gil scored once. Eventually he signed for Coventry City \u2013 who had knocked City out of the FA Cup a few weeks earlier \u2013 in December 1929, along with George Plummer for a joint fee of \u00a3700. He went on to play for Walsall, WBA and Ipswich Town, before returning to Walsall to finish his playing career in 1947, staying with the Midlands clubs as groundsman and trainer. When they moved to their new Bescott Stadium in 1990 a stand was named in his honour, although ten years later it became the Purple Loans and then Floors-to-Go Stand!\n\nHarry Andrews 13 10 A forward signed from Merthyr Town during the second half of the 1928-29 season. He began his career with Torquay United (then a non-league club) before joining Exeter City in 1927.

He had started his career at Wrexham, but failed to make a first-team appearance. In April 1948 he joined Cardiff City where he played one game before his short spell at Twerton Park. After this he went on to have two spells with Newport County, plus stints at Merthyr Tydfil, Millford and Barry Town.\n\nCyril Ashworth 1 0 Played for the club during the 1949-50 season.

David McKay was well known for preparing and racing cars and specialised in preparing cars for longer distance events and this led to some endurance drives for Brown and Martin.\n\nIn 1964 Brown teamed up with Martin for the 500 mile race at Bathurst and the pair won their class at in a Vauxhall Viva.\n\nThe relationship with McKay grew and saw Bill Brown racing in sports cars.\n\nIn 1966, he took a class victory in the Surfers Paradise 12Hour in a Volvo P1800 he shared with David McKay.\n\nThe relationship with McKay also gave him the opportunity to race the fabulous Scuderia Veloce Ferrari 250LM.\n\nThe 250LM delivered Brown many race wins. Indeed, Brown rated his greatest race victory as that of winning the 1967 Surfers Paradise 12 Hour. In that race he shared the victory with Greg Cusack.\n\nBrown also managed to prang the very valuable Ferrari at Warwick Farm in 1967.\n\nThe relationship with Scuderia Veloce\u2019s David McKay also gave him the opportunity to race another fabulous Ferrari, when in 1968 McKay imported the Ferrari Can-Am 350. The Ferrari had been converted from one of the 1967 Le Mans 4.0 Litre V12 factory P4\u2019s.\n\nOriginally imported for Chris Amon to race, Brown drove the car at a round of the Tasman Series at Longford. During the event, Brown set an Australian speed record at the tree lined Tasmanian road circuit of 182.9 MPH (294.5 Km/h), this was the fastest ever recorded outright speed at an Australian race circuit at the time.\n\nA few months later he raced the car at Bathurst and set another record for the fastest official time down Conrod straight of 181 MPH (291 Km/h).\n\nIn 1968 Brown was part of the first Holden Dealer Racing Team, racing the new HK Holden Monaro GTS 327.\n\nIt was a clandestine \u2018Factory effort\u2019 sponsored by the Sydney Daily Telegraph newspaper and put together by Scuderia Veloce\u2019s David McKay.\n\nAlthough a Monaro delivered Holden its first \u2018Great race\u2019 win, it was a privateer in Bruce McPhee and Barry Mullholland who took the flag first.\n\nThe best placed car of the McKay managed Holden Dealer Racing Team Monaro\u2019s was Jim Palmer/Phil West in second, while a damaged wheel put Brown and teammate Paul Hawkins Monaro out of the race.\n\nBut for most race fans, it was the two big Bathurst crashes that Brown had during the running of the 500-mile production car races that he became infamous for.\n\nIn 1969, on the opening lap he crashed the big Falcon XW GT HO on the run down the hill from Skyline after a slight touch with another competitor. It was a big crash that saw many competitors get caught up in and the race was slowed to a crawl while the wreckage was removed.\n\nAnd then in 1971, it was the huge crash at McPhillamy Park that will live long in the memories of most touring car fans.\n\nIt is a crash that is still considered to be one of the most violent ever witnessed and is regularly played in event highlight packages.\n\nWhile running competitively in the front part of the field, Brown\u2019s XY GTHO Phase III Falcon blew a tyre in the high-speed run through McPhillamy and then after losing control and slamming into the fence, the big Falcon barrel rolled along the top of the armco narrowly missing an official and slicing the big sedan in half just behind the driver\u2019s seat.\n\nMost who witnessed the incident feared that Brown had been killed or at least seriously injured, but after several minutes, with the help of officials and spectators Brown emerged from the wreckage with a few minor cuts and bruises and was thankful that the big Falcon had not ended up in the crowd.\n\nBrown kept racing and in the early 1970\u2019s was still a fast peddler in 911 Porsche\u2019s and competed in the Australian Touring Car Championship races. Later his Porsche 911 carried the Grace Bros signage.\n\nDuring the \u201970\u2019s Brown continued to race occasionally at Bathurst and last competed at Bathurst in 1978, with by then former wife Sue Ransom in Ford Capri GT 3000 Mk.1.\n\nWhile he only ever considered himself an amateur racer, he was still highly regarded for his abilities.\n\nBrown retired from a successful business life several years ago.\n\nAUTO ACTION extends our condolences to Bill Brown\u2019s family, friends and those who knew him."}, {"url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a7208731/celebrity-club-appearances-facts/", "page_content": "Getty\n\nA chart-topping song or TV role can yield a pretty paycheck, sure, but for many celebs, the real bread and butter is in the two-hour club appearance. So what goes into these lucrative deals, beyond fist-pumping? Cosmopolitan.com spoke to David Weintraub, CEO of DWE Talent, a management, film and television production company that represents the likes of Scott Disick, Brody Jenner, and Ray J \u2014 all big-paycheck club headliners \u2014 to learn more.\n\n1. From beginning to end, a club appearance usually takes less than two hours. \u201cThe job is to come in, take pictures, do something like a press line \u2014 but without any real important press \u2014 and host. Obviously a 90-Day Fianc\u00e9 star is not going to be talking to Cosmo about their future in the TV business at a red carpet. However, Scott Disick for an example, he is going to do 20 minutes on the press line, which will be five to 10 interviews; he will probably do four minutes of pictures with [the club\u2019s] big-dollar spenders who are guaranteed to get a picture with him, and then after that everything is cut off, he has to go in and do his appearance, talk on the mic, say hello to everyone, maybe do a couple of inside pictures, depending. His total amount of job duties [take], like, 30 minutes, tops.\u201d\n\nMore From Cosmopolitan play icon The triangle icon that indicates to play\n\n2. The celebrity isn\u2019t actually there to party. \u201cThey are not really trying to hang out at the club \u2014 it\u2019s a meat circus for them. You can\u2019t really have fun there, especially if your life is getting scrutinized. Everything they are doing is being looked at and talked about: Who did they talk to? Who did they hug? Who shook their hand? How did they treat somebody? Any picture can be taken out of context. A photo at the wrong angle of some girl saying, \u2019Hi, I am a huge fan,\u2019 and whispering in your ear can all of a sudden become, \u2019Are you dating that person or did you hook up with them?\u2019 The world of Instagram and social media has complicated public appearances. I would say [it can cause] issues at home.\u201d\n\n3. The negotiations are intense. \u201cYou don\u2019t just walk up and you get handed a stack of cash. This is planned out, weeks and sometimes months, in advance. There are a lot of [logistics] like hair and makeup, arrival time. How many pictures they are going to take? How many autographs are they going to sign? Are they drinking? Are they bringing their TV-show crew with them? Then there are all the travel arrangements. Will it be coach tickets, first-class tickets, your own private plane? How many hotel rooms, meals per diem? I have seen crazy demands.\u201d\n\nGetty\n\n4. Seriously, the demands can be crazy. \u201cSometimes I will talk the clients into the crazy demands \u2014 I know that we can get them, so why not? If you\u2019re going to a major hotel like Omnia at Caesars Palace and you\u2019re going to go perform, I know that they can give you 10 rooms, two suites, a fantasy suite, all the ground transportation, all the food, anything you want, because it\u2019s really just a write-off and it\u2019s all there. There is also picking and choosing what type of crowd you want in the club that night \u2014 you want it to be mostly girls, mostly guys, a mix? Big things that people demand a lot of these days is Don Julio 1942, Johnnie Walker Blue. Ace of Spades is the big \"It\" Champagne that everybody has to drink. The bottle is [about] $300 and it comes in this black box, and it\u2019s a whole thing to open the box.\u201d\n\n5. Social media stars aren\u2019t a major draw. \u201cThe biggest payday is in the DJ world, reality TV, and rap. You\u2019ve got to remember, to do an appearance, it\u2019s not that you need to be highly skilled, it\u2019s that you need to have some type of value that is going to attract people to come. So the Instagram and YouTube world, a lot of which is semi-comedy, [aren\u2019t as profitable]. It\u2019s not like people are going to go to a nightclub to hear somebody do some type of shtick or do some weird Vine video. Also, women make a lot more than men \u2014 not compared to rappers or DJs, strictly in the reality world.\"\n\n6. Paychecks range from a couple thousand to over a quarter million dollars. \u201cBottom-of-the-barrel reality TV stars, they are probably getting between $5,000 to $15,000 to do an appearance. The next tier up is going to be your Love & Hip Hop, your Housewives, and they are going for probably between $15,000 and $50,000. And then you have the Kardashians, Paris Hilton, Amber Rose, Blac Chyna, Future, Drake, 2 Chainz, Snoop Dogg \u2014 they have their own tier, which is probably $50,000 to $250,000 and upward. I am not doing a deal for $5,000 \u2014 I don\u2019t have time to do that kind of deal. I don\u2019t have time to hear your demands. I don\u2019t need to make $300 on a deal, I need to make $30,000.\u201d\n\n7. Venues expect exclusivity. \"These guys have to commit to some level of exclusivity for a period of time \u2014 that will [affect] the money they are going to receive. Depending on the talent, they likely can\u2019t [go to another club prior to their commitment]. It really comes down to the territory. If you\u2019re doing something in Atlantic City, you\u2019re not going to be affected by an L.A. pop-in. [But] they do try to keep the attention that you may be getting to a minimum. You definitely can\u2019t allow [another venue] to do any marketing or advertising with your likeness.\"\n\nGetty\n\n8. There is a constant need for damage control. \u201cAs a manager and as a booker for those celebrities, you are in a constant battle between the client and the venue and all of the rigmarole that goes in between. I have to be the sane person to mediate, to let talent know that their demands are maybe off the wall and crazy, and to let the club know when they are oversold and they have too much press and they want too many pictures. Or they want you to meet this guy because this guy usually spends $100,000 a week at the club and he has got to sit right next to the talent \u2014 but your talent doesn\u2019t like that person and they want to sit next to [the talent].\u201d\n\n\n\n9. You can\u2019t cash in on appearances forever. \u201cYou got to get it while you\u2019re hot. You are only as relevant as your last hit or your last look. You got to monetize it immediately. If a big story hits or a big show is about to come out or we know there\u2019s going to be a big media circus surrounding something, you got to be preemptive, out there booking the dates ahead of time.\u201d\n\n10. There\u2019s a huge market for private parties. And foodie celebrities are on the rise. \u201cPeople assume club, club, club \u2014 OK, but the other huge world that we deal with is the private world \u2014 and it\u2019s 10 times the money. The bar mitzvahs, the private birthday parties, the rich family get-togethers, the holiday parties, those are the big ones. [An artist] can go get $300,000 to play two songs at a party for somebody. Also, the foodie scene is starting to emerge as a big payday world. This is the next area. I haven\u2019t seen the big plateau with the Instagram/model world; everybody thinks that these Instagram models are making money but they are not. They are making $100 to $500 to go do appearances. I am not really going to deal with somebody who takes pictures all day unless you\u2019re the biggest one in the game.\u201d\n\nFollow Darla on Twitter.\n\n\n\nCorrection: a previous version of this post suggested Omnia hosts celebrity red carpets, which is not accurate. It also incorrectly stated that Omnia is at the MGM; it\u2019s at Caesars Palace."}, {"url": "https://theanalyst.com/2022/08/youngest-players-to-play-100-premier-league-games/", "page_content": "Race to the Century: The Youngest Players to Play 100 Premier League Games\n\nArsenal\u2019s Bukayo Saka and Manchester City\u2019s Phil Foden both made their 100th Premier League appearance at the weekend, versus Bournemouth and Newcastle United respectively.\n\nSurely they\u2019re two of the youngest players to reach a century of Premier League games, right?\n\nCorrect for Saka, but very wrong for Foden.\n\nWhilst Saka enters just inside the top 10 \u2013 level with Joe Cole at 20 years and 349 days old, there are 52 tyros that can put their hand up and say that they were younger than Foden when they reached the 100 appearances in the competition \u2013 we look in detail at the youngest five.\n\nNo.1: Wayne Rooney\n\n19 years, 321 days old\n\nMatch: Manchester United 1-1 Manchester City (10 September 2005)\n\nWayne Rooney became the youngest player to reach 100 Premier League appearances when he played for Manchester United in their derby against Manchester City at Old Trafford in September 2005. In doing so, he broke a 10-year record in the competition, overtaking Chris Bart-Williams\u2019 achievement of being the youngest of the landmark in February 1995.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t to score or assist in his 100th league appearance, but Rooney had tallied 39 goal involvements by this point in his career \u2013 only Michael Owen (54) has ever had more goal involvements by Rooney\u2019s age on the day of this record-breaking 100th appearance.\n\nTotal Premier League appearances: 491\n\nTotal top flight league appearances: 539\n\nVerdict: At the time of writing, Rooney is still the all-time leading scorer for Man Utd in all competitions (253 goals), while only Bobby Charlton (199) has scored more league goals for the club than he did (183). He is also the leading scorer in England men\u2019s history (53), while no outfielder has won as many caps for the Three Lions (120).\n\nOnly Alan Shearer (260) scored more Premier League goals than Rooney (208), only Ryan Giggs (162) and Cesc F\u00e0bregas (111) assisted more often in the competition than he did (103), while he was one of only three players to reach the century of goals and assists in the competition (alongside Shearer and Frank Lampard), but having played his last Premier League game 179 days short of his 33rd birthday, there will always be a lingering feeling that he could have achieved even more.\n\nRooney is, arguably, the Premier League\u2019s last anti sports science player who will make it on sheer talent alone.\n\nNo.2: Cesc F\u00e0bregas\n\n19 years, 340 days old\n\nMatch: Newcastle United 0-0 Arsenal (9 April 2007)\n\nNothing much happened on Monday 9 April 2007 at St James\u2019 Park in a drab 0-0 draw between Newcastle and Arsenal, but it did see Spanish midfielder Cesc F\u00e0bregas make his 100th Premier League appearance.\n\nHe missed out on becoming the youngest to the landmark by only 19 days, but as a consolation prize he became the youngest non-English star to a century of Premier League appearances.\n\nTotal Premier League appearances: 350\n\nTotal top flight league appearances: 500 (at the time of writing)\n\nVerdict: Cesc F\u00e0bregas is rightly remembered as one of the best creative players in Premier League history, with only Ryan Giggs (162) having more assists in the competition than him. Since his first Premier League season in 2004-05, F\u00e0bregas has created 846 chances and assisted 111 goals \u2013 no player can match those tallies in the competition.\n\nHe left Arsenal in the search for a league title medal \u2013 which he got in his second season in the first-team at Barcelona in La Liga (2012-13), before adding two Premier League titles with Chelsea in 2014-15 and 2016-17.\n\nA rarity in that he\u2019s loved by both Arsenal and Chelsea fans, just like the FA Cup trophy this century.\n\nNo.3: James Milner\n\n20 years, 104 days old\n\nMatch: Wigan Athletic 3-2 Aston Villa (18 April 2006)\n\nJames Milner made his 100th Premier League appearance in a five-goal thriller between Wigan and Aston Villa in April 2006 \u2013 unfortunately for the English midfielder, he ended on the losing side.\n\nOn loan from Newcastle United at the time, Milner became the second youngest player to reach 100 appearances, just seven months after Wayne Rooney set the record (Fabregas overtook Milner a year later, pushing him to third in the rankings).\n\nMilner was recognised for his achievement with a card \u2013 a yellow from then-referee, now TV-man-in-a-room-explaining-VAR-decisions expert Peter Walton.\n\nTotal Premier League appearances: 590 (at the time of writing)\n\nTotal top flight league appearances: 590 (at the time of writing)\n\nVerdict: Nothing boring about being the third youngest player to 100 Premier League appearances, is there.\n\nHe holds the title of the Premier League\u2019s most used substitute (177) and is now just 10 matches away from being only the fourth player to reach 600 Premier League appearances. With only 64 appearances left to make before breaking Gareth Barry\u2019s competition appearance record, Milner is a rare occurrence of a player being used so often in his teenage years yet lasting the distance. Even more impressively, he\u2019s still doing it at one of the best clubs in European football, Liverpool, and now has a beard.\n\nNo.4: Chris Bart-Williams\n\n20 years, 247 days old\n\nMatch: Sheffield Wednesday 1-2 Aston Villa (18 February 1995)\n\nChris Bart-Williams is probably a name unknown to many modern Premier League fans but let me be the one to tell you that he was an excellent player, equally as comfortable in an attacking midfield role or more defensively later in his career.\n\nBart-Williams was a key player across England youth sides, but cruelly never won a full international cap for the Three Lions despite their struggles in the first half of the 1990s.\n\nHis 100th Premier League appearance came in February 1995, as the Owls lost 2-1 at home to Aston Villa \u2013 a Dean Saunders brace ruining his day.\n\nBart-Williams may have been the 27th player to reach 100 appearances in the Premier League, but a little-known fact is that he was the first to do so under the age of 21.\n\nTotal Premier League appearances: 211\n\nTotal top flight league appearances: 226\n\nVerdict: Bart-Williams made more Premier League appearances before his 21st birthday (109) than he did after it (102), with four of his last five seasons as a Nottingham Forest player coming in the second tier. Undoubtedly a big talent, he never lived up to expectations of many \u2013 but still had a solid enough career overall, though.\n\nNo.5: Michael Owen\n\n20 years, 270 days old\n\nMatch: Liverpool 3-2 Manchester City (9 September 2000)\n\nWhen Michael Owen broke through at Liverpool in 1998, he was arguably the first potential world class striker produced by England in the Premier League era.\n\nOn his 100th Premier League appearance \u2013 against Man City in September 2000, Owen scored his 54th goal in the competition. Only 12 players have scored more than Owen by the time they\u2019d reached a century of appearances in the Premier League, none of those at a younger age.\n\nOverall, he managed 72 goal involvements in his first 100 Premier League games, and he was still 95 days shy of his 21st birthday.\n\nTotal Premier League appearances: 326\n\nTotal top flight league appearances: 362\n\nVerdict: Weirdly, despite being such an obvious talent and potent goal scorer, Owen never registered 20 goals in a single league season as a player.\n\nOnly five players scored more goals for the England men\u2019s team than Owen (41), while he remains the last Englishman to win the Ballon d\u2019Or (2001).\n\nInjuries robbed Owen of a phenomenal career \u2013 he played just 619 minutes of league football following his 30th birthday, scoring four goals. To show what he could have achieved with a little more luck, Alan Shearer was able to come back from serious injuries in his 20s and go on to score 84 more Premier League goals in his 30s.\n\nNo. 6-10\n\nHere are the names who round out the top 10, all of them English and with nine Premier League title wins between them.\n\n\n\nNo.6: Raheem Sterling (20 years, 285 days)\n\nNo.7: Gareth Barry (20 years, 323 days)\n\nNo.8: Micah Richards (20 years, 334 days)\n\nNo.9: Robbie Fowler (20 years, 342 days)\n\n=No.10: Joe Cole (20 years, 349 days)\n\n=No.10: Bukayo Saka (20 years, 349 days)\n\nEnjoy this?
