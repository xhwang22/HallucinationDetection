How should he be remembered?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Harry Benson/Getty Images Harry Benson/Getty Images\n\nJust after midnight on June 5, 1968, in a ballroom in the ornate Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, a packed crowd watched charismatic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy give a victory speech after winning the California primary.\n\nAlmost five years after his older brother John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Robert Kennedy was making his own run for the White House. America was divided over the Civil Rights Movement and the war in Vietnam.\n\nThe New York senator was gaining momentum to potentially secure the Democratic nomination. But that night \u2014 55 years ago today \u2014 was the last time he would address the public.\n\nA second Kennedy assassinated\n\nAs Kennedy walked off stage at the Ambassador Hotel through a pack of eager reporters, the crowd chanted his name.\n\n\"We want Bobby,\" they cheered.\n\nKennedy shook hands with supporters and exited the ballroom through the kitchen. Then, the crowd heard what witnesses would later describe as the sound of firecrackers. A gunman fired a .22 caliber revolver, hitting Kennedy and injuring five others.\n\nOlympic gold medalist Rafer Johnson \u2014 one of Kennedy's friends who worked on his campaign \u2014 wrestled the gunman to the ground and tried to disarm him.\n\nAmid the chaos, teenage busboy Juan Romero comforted Kennedy, who was sprawled out on the floor.\n\n\"I kneeled down to him and put my hand between the cold concrete and his head just to make him comfortable,\" Romero told StoryCorps in 2018. \"I could feel a steady stream of blood coming through my fingers. I had a rosary in my shirt pocket, and I took it out thinking that he would need it a lot more than me. I wrapped it around his right hand, and then they wheeled him away.\"\n\nKennedy died the next day. He was 42. His widow, Ethel, was pregnant with their 11th child.\n\nCampaigning on race, with some contradictions\n\nMourners lined up before dawn outside New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral for Kennedy's funeral mass.

Ted Kennedy delivered the eulogy.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images\n\n\"As he said many times in many parts of this nation: Some men see things as they are and say 'Why?' \" Kennedy said. \"I dream things that never were and say 'Why not?' \"\n\nRobert Kennedy was memorialized as a liberal icon who found support among Black and Latino voters.\n\n\"He made a virtue of abrasiveness in his 1968 campaign, deliberately taunting affluent constituencies on behalf of the disadvantaged,\" NPR commentator Rod MacLeish said in 1983.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption AFP via Getty Images AFP via Getty Images\n\nBut Kennedy was complicated and contradictory, especially when it came to one particular decision. As U.S. attorney general, he authorized the FBI to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr.'s telephones in 1963, because of suspicion that one of King's aides had communist ties.\n\nBut Kennedy was a well-known advocate for marginalized communities and spoke about racial equality during his campaign. Two months before his own death, Kennedy gave an impromptu speech to a mostly Black crowd in Indianapolis about the assassination of Dr. King.\n\n\"What we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but love and compassion toward one another, a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer, whether they be white or whether be Black,\" he said.\n\nOn the day Kennedy died, Congress responded by expanding Secret Service protection to include major presidential candidates. The man who shot Kennedy was convicted of first-degree murder and continues to serve a life sentence.\n\nThe room where it happened\n\nToday, there is no Ambassador Hotel. It was demolished in 2006.\n\nThe site in LA is now a complex of public schools called the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools. There are vibrant murals all over campus and in the hallways. The walls of the school library are adorned with portraits and huge, colorful paintings of Kennedy.\n\nMost of the students there are Latino. Over the years, many of the students who graduate are the first in their families to attend college."}, {"url": "https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/bobby-kennedy-is-assassinated", "page_content": "Shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, Senator Robert Kennedy is shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles after winning the California presidential primary. Immediately after he announced to his cheering supporters that the country was ready to end its fractious divisions, Kennedy was shot several times by 24-year-old Palestinian Sirhan Sirhan. He was pronounced dead a day later, on June 6, 1968.\n\nThe summer of 1968 was a tempestuous time in American history. Both the Vietnam War and the anti-war movement were peaking. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated in the spring, igniting riots across the country. In the face of this unrest, President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to seek a second term in the upcoming presidential election. Robert Kennedy, John\u2019s younger brother and former U.S. Attorney General, stepped into this breach and experienced a groundswell of support.\n\nKennedy was perceived by many to be the only person in American politics capable of uniting the people. He was beloved by the minority community for his integrity and devotion to the civil rights cause. After winning California\u2019s primary, Kennedy was in the position to receive the Democratic nomination and face off against Richard Nixon in the general election.\n\nAs star athletes Rafer Johnson and Roosevelt Grier accompanied Kennedy out a rear exit of the Ambassador Hotel, Sirhan Sirhan stepped forward with a rolled up campaign poster, hiding his .22 revolver. He was only a foot away when he fired several shots at Kennedy. Grier and Johnson wrestled Sirhan to the ground, but not before five bystanders were wounded. Grier was distraught afterward and blamed himself for allowing Kennedy to be shot.\n\nSirhan, who was born in Palestine, confessed to the crime at his trial and received a death sentence on March 3, 1969. However, since the California State Supreme Court invalidated all death penalty sentences in 1972, Sirhan has spent the rest of his life in prison. According to the New York Times, he has since said that he believed Kennedy was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in the oppression of Palestinians. Hubert Humphrey ended up running for the Democrats in 1968, but lost to Nixon."}, {"url": "https://www.shapell.org/historical-perspectives/between-the-lines/the-assassination-funeral-of-robert-f-kennedy/", "page_content": "Robert F. Kennedy died some twenty-six hours after having been shot, on June 6th, 1968. He was 42 years old, and his death marked more than the end of the most revolutionary, passionate, and remarkably inclusive campaign in American history. Kennedy\u2019s assassination at the hands of a Palestinian fanatic, Reagan presciently noted, was also a beginning. This was a terrorist attack, he said just days later, rooted in anti-Semitism and hatred of Israel, against the United States itself. While most of the news coverage focused on the history of American political assassination \u2013 by then four presidents had been assassinated, and the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., shot and killed just 8 weeks before \u2013 Reagan sensed, in the unraveling of the sixties, a terror yet to come.\n\nBut Reagan\u2019s speech about Kennedy\u2019s death was a week away; his prophecy about Arab terrorism on American soil, decades: it was what began on the night Kennedy was shot, and ended three nights later when he was laid to rest at Arlington cemetery next to his brother\u2019s gravesite, that truly marked those days out of time. It was, for those who lived through it, perhaps the greatest, and most spontaneous expression of national grief, they would ever know.\n\nThe Funeral of Robert Kennedy\n\nThe funeral of Robert Kennedy began simply. At 1:59 on the morning of June 6th, Kennedy Press Secretary Frank Mankiewicz, his Kennedy pin on his lapel, made a short announcement. The Senator had died fifteen minutes before; his wife, two of his sisters, one of his brothers-in-law, and his sister-in-law, Mrs. John F. Kennedy, were with him at the time of his death. He was 42 years old.\n\nOn the afternoon of the 6th, a funeral cortege made its way down Wilshire Blvd. to the airport. A jet, one of the three officially emblazoned \u201cUnited States of America\u201d had been sent by President Johnson to carry the coffin and mourners home to New York City. Jacqueline Kennedy, seeing this Air Force One, had to be assured it was not the plane that carried President Kennedy\u2019s coffin from Dallas to Washington before she would board it.\n\nTed Kennedy\u2019s Eulogy For Robert Kennedy\n\nIn New York, on Saturday, June 8th, at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral on 5th Avenue, Kennedy\u2019s brother Ted, his voice cracking, delivered the eulogy, of which one sentence proved indelible: \u201cMy brother need not be idealized,\u201d he said, \u201cor enlarged in death beyond what he was in life, to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it.\u201d From New York, Kennedy\u2019s body traveled the 225 miles to Washington, through mostly rural and poorer America aboard a 21-car funeral train. The trip, which should have taken 4 hours, took double. About 2 million people lined the train tracks to say goodbye. Some wore suits-and-ties, some bathing trunks; some carried flags, some saluted, some held signs, some wept silently. Occasionally Ethel Kennedy, now a widow with 10 children and an 11th on the way, appeared with Ted Kennedy on the last car\u2019s platform, waving.\n\nArriving in Washington, the funeral cortege stopped at the Lincoln Memorial where, in the gathering darkness, the Marine Band sang \u201cThe Battle Hymn of the Republic.\u201d At the gravesite, hastily lit by hundreds of candles (and a bank of blinding floodlights), there was a brief ceremony, and then the folded flag that had draped the casket was handed to Kennedy\u2019s eldest son who, in turn, handed it to his mother. Kennedy\u2019s coffin was lowered into the grave at 11:34 P.M. \u2013 the only night funeral ever at Arlington National Cemetery. It was over."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/US/50-years-shots-rang-ambassador-hotel-controversy-surrounds/story?id=55504645", "page_content": "Deafening chants of \"We want Bobby!\" filled the stifling Embassy Room of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles around midnight on June 5, 1968, as New York Sen. Robert Francis Kennedy weaved his way across a jam-packed stage.\n\nWhen he finally reached the microphones, they weren't working.\n\n\"Can we get something that works?\" the senator shouted to his aides in a Boston Brahmin accent that reminded many in the ballroom of his assassinated brother, the 35th president of the United States who challenged America to \"choose to go to the moon.\"\n\nHe had arrived in the ballroom to declare victory in the California Democratic presidential primary, beating Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy by a narrow voting margin of 46 percent to 42 percent.\n\nRear view of Sen. Robert Kennedy and his pregnant wife Ethel standing at a podium at the Ambassador Hotel as he addresses supporters after his California primary election victory, Los Angeles, June 5, 1968. The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nThe win was a prized milestone for Bobby Kennedy in what was still an uphill battle for the Democratic nomination for president, a journey that got a late jump on March 16, 1968, when he announced his candidacy in the Senate Caucus Room of the Capitol Building in Washington, the same venue where his brother, John F. Kennedy, launched his successful presidential bid in January 1960.\n\n\"I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I'm obliged to do all I can,\" the 42-year-old Kennedy, who had served as U.S. Attorney General in his brother's administration, said as he pitched his hat into the ring for the nation's highest office.\n\nFive decades after Kennedy emerged as a beacon of hope to millions of young Americans disenchanted by a war half a world away and disintegrating race relations at home in the chaotic aftermath of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, many questions about his death remain unanswered. His eldest son and namesake now says he firmly believes his father's real killer eluded arrest and the case needs to be reinvestigated.\n\nSen. Robert Kennedy addressing a crowd from a stage with his wife Ethel moments before Kennedy's assassination, Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, June 5, 1968. Julian Wasser/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images\n\n\"I was disturbed that the wrong person might have been convicted of killing my father,\" Robert F. Kennedy Jr., 64, an environmental attorney and activist, told The Washington Post last month. \"My father was the chief law enforcement officer in this country. I think it would have disturbed him if somebody was put in jail for a crime they didn't commit.\"\n\nRFK Jr., who was just 14 when his dad was killed, said he reached the conclusion that a second gunman got away after visiting for three hours late last year with his father's convicted assassin. He is renewing calls to reopen the homicide case, a request he first made in a 2012 letter to U.S. Attorney Eric Holder and presented to the California Department of Corrections Board of Parole in 2016 at convicted killer Sirhan Sirhan's 15th unsuccessful parole hearing.\n\nWhile there is little doubt Sirhan wounded Kennedy and five others, some of the major questions about one of the most public homicides in U.S. history persists today:\n\n-- Why did forensic scientists studying audio of the shooting hear 13 shots when Sirhan's gun only held eight bullets and he had no time to reload?\n\n-- How could Sirhan have killed Kennedy when he was standing in front of him when he fired his weapon, while the autopsy report shows the fatal point-blank shot entered RFK's skull behind his right ear?\n\n-- But the biggest question can never be answered. Had he been elected president, could Kennedy have realized his ambition to unite a country divided on many fronts, end poverty and foster race and economic equality?\n\nCampaign gets late start\n\nWhen Robert Kennedy started his campaign, President Lyndon Johnson, who had been his brother's vice president and former Senate Majority Leader, was still expected to seek reelection. But when Johnson stunned the country on March 31, 1968, in a televised announcement that he would not run, Kennedy's quest to succeed him skyrocketed.\n\nHe won primaries in Indiana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Washington, D.C. By the night of his victory in California, he had become a viable challenger to be his party's nominee. But it was not a sure thing. Sitting Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the favored candidate of the Democratic Party machine, stood in his way as the countdown to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago got underway.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy (silhouetted) speaks at U.C. Berkeley's Greek Theatre on behalf of Gov. Edmund G. Brown, Oct. 1, 1966. Bill Eppridge/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nAs Kennedy finally found a working microphone at the Ambassador Hotel that Wednesday, the first person he mentioned, surprisingly, was Don Drysdale, the All-Star pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\n\"I want to express my high regard to Don Drysdale, who pitched his sixth straight shutout tonight and hope that we have as good fortune in our campaign,\" a smiling Kennedy said as supporters cheered loudly.\n\nKennedy appeared jovial, his optimistic mood added even more electricity to an already electrified crowd as he thanked those who worked on his California campaign. His wife, Ethel, three months pregnant with their 11th child, stood next to him.\n\nThe candidate joked that he wanted to \"express my gratitude to my dog, Freckles, who has been maligned,\" he said, referring to the criticism he had received for taking his beloved English springer spaniel on the campaign trail with him. \"As Franklin Roosevelt said, 'I don't care what they say about me, but when they start to attack my dog...'\"\n\nLater in the speech, Kennedy -- who had become a critic of the Vietnam War, a conflict he admitted helping prolong as his brother's most trusted White House adviser, and had made combating poverty and racial inequality cornerstones of his campaign -- turned serious.\n\n\"What I think is quite clear is that we can work together in the last analysis and that what has been going on in the United States over the last three years, the divisions, the violence, the disenchantment with our society, the divisions whether it's between blacks and whites, between the poor and the more affluent, or between age groups or on the war in Vietnam, that we can start to work together,\" Kennedy said.\n\n\"We are a great country, an unselfish country, a compassionate country. And I intend to make that my basis for running,\" he said. \"So, my thanks to all of you, and now it's on to Chicago and let's win there.\"\n\nCheers turn to horror\n\nThe time was 12:15 a.m. when Kennedy left the stage to euphoric cheers and more chants of \"Kennedy! Kennedy! Kennedy!\" and \"RFK!\"\n\nHe was led off the stage and through a door to the pantry where surprised kitchen workers clamored to meet him. He was leaning over a counter shaking hands with 17-year-old busboy Juan Romero when a man armed with an eight-shot, .22-caliber Iver-Johnson revolver charged up to Kennedy and opened fire.\n\nRFK, according to the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's autopsy report, was hit three times. One bullet grazed his forehead, another penetrated his neck, and the third entered behind the right ear and smashed through his skull.\n\nThe path of the fatal bullet, according to the autopsy report, traveled through the \"skin of [the] right mastoid region\" and continued through the \"right mastoid, petrous portion of right temporal bone, right temporal lobe, right cerebellum, and brain stem.\"\n\nFive other people, including Paul Schrade, the regional director for the United Auto Workers, and a close friend of Kennedy, and William Weisel, a retired ABC News associate director, were wounded by the gunfire.\n\nSen.

J.R. McArthur of the Los Angeles Police Department told ABC News at the time.\n\nRafer Johnson, who won the gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, was among the shocked bystanders who quickly grabbed the gunman, later identified as Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship.\n\nAn iconic picture taken by photojournalist Bill Eppridge for Life magazine captured Juan Romero kneeling and cradling Kennedy's bleeding head against his white busboy coat.\n\nNews of the shooting quickly spread, transforming the chandeliered ballroom where the large boisterous crowd was still celebrating into a room of horror and tears. Screams of \"No!\" and \"Why?\" echoed through the venue. Kennedy's aides returned to the microphones that the hopeful candidate had used to now ask for doctors to come backstage immediately and try to save his life.\n\nKennedy was taken by ambulance to Central Receiving Hospital and then transferred to The Good Samaritan Hospital, where he battled for his life as the nation held its collective breath and the president addressed the nation in a televised statement.\n\n\"I speak to you this evening not as your president, but as a fellow American that's shocked and dismayed as you are by the attempt on Sen. Kennedy's life,\" Johnson said from the White House. \"Deeply disturbed, as I know you are, by lawlessness and violence in our country of which this tragedy is the latest spectacular example.\"\n\nHe asked the nation to pray, but the prayers were not answered.\n\nAt 1:44 a.m. on June 6, 1968, Kennedy died. At his bedside when he took his last breath were his wife, his sisters, Jean Smith and Patricia Lawford, and his widowed sister-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nRFK's body was flown to New York, where a funeral Mass was held on June 8 at St. Patrick's Cathedral.\n\n\"My brother need not be idealized or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it,\" Ted Kennedy said in the eulogy to his second brother slain in less than five years.\n\nHis casket was placed aboard a special funeral train at Manhattan's Penn Station and with 1,000 relatives, friends and campaign workers set off to Union Station in Washington, D.C., a 225-mile trip delayed numerous times by tens of thousands of people lining the tracks to get a glimpse and pay respects to the now-martyred people's champion.\n\nKennedy, who had enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and served from 1944 to 1946, was buried 50 feet southwest of JFK's grave at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nAssassin convicted\n\nSirhan Sirhan's trial in Los Angeles Superior Court began on Feb. 12, 1969, after Judge Herbert V. Walker rejected his offer to plead guilty to all charges and face execution.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy being comforted by an aide, after being fatally wounded at the Ambassador Hotel, June 5, 1968. Bill Eppridge/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nIn his opening argument, prosecutor David Fitts said Sirhan had practiced at a gun range the day before Kennedy's assassination, that he had cased out the Ambassador Hotel in advance of the shooting, and told his garbage collector a year before the murder that he intended to kill RFK.\n\nOn March 3, 1969, Sirhan was called to testify at his trial and admitted he shot Kennedy \"with 20 years of malice aforethought.\" When his defense attorney Grant Cooper asked him why, the defendant went on a rant about the \"Middle East conflict between Arab and Jew.\"\n\nA psychiatrist called by the defense said Sirhan suffered from diminished mental capacity at the time of Kennedy's murder, but the jury rejected his diagnosis.\n\nOn April 17, 1969, Sirhan was convicted of murdering Kennedy and six days later he was sentenced to die in the gas chamber in San Quintin State Prison. His sentence was commuted to a life term in 1972 when the California Supreme Court found that the death penalty constituted cruel and unusual punishment under the California state constitution.\n\nAppeals and parole denials\n\nIn a 1989 televised interview British broadcaster David Frost conducted for \"Inside Edition\" at the maximum-security state prison in Soledad, California, Sirhan said he felt betrayed by Kennedy's support of Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.\n\n\"My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians,\" he told Frost, referring to a speech RFK gave in support of United States supplying fighter jets to Israel.\n\n\"I was not doing it out of personal malice toward the man, but out of concern for other people,\" Sirhan, who had immigrated to the United States with his family as a boy, said of why he killed Kennedy.\n\n\"I can't say anything except that I am totally sorry and feel nothing but remorse for having caused that tragic death,\" he said.\n\nIn 2011, Sirhan's new lawyer, William F. Pepper, filed an appeal asking for a retrial based on newly discovered evidence. Pepper argued that sophisticated tests done on an audio recording of the shooting made by freelance newspaper journalist Stanislaw Pruszynski detected 13 gunshots fired in the attack.\n\nHe introduced the theory that a second gunman killed Kennedy and laid out a wild plot in which Sirhan was brainwashed into being the fall guy.\n\n\"There is no question he was hypno-programmed,\" Pepper told ABC News at the time. \"He was set up. He was used. He was manipulated.\"\n\nRobert F. Kennedy's wife Ethel tries to comfort him after he was mortally wounded on June 5, 1968 at the Ambassador Hotel in California. Bill Eppridge/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the appeal in April 2016.\n\nBut that same year, an unlikely witness came forward to speak at Sirhan's 15th parole hearing and asked for a new investigation.\n\n\"I am here to speak for myself, a shooting victim, and to bear witness for my friend, Bob Kennedy,\" Paul Schrade, then 91, told the parole board, according to a transcript of the hearing.\n\nSchrade, who had been shot in the head during the attack, had testified at Sirhan's 1969 trial, pointing the defendant out as the man who committed the shooting.\n\nDuring the parole board hearing, Schrade said he still had no doubt that Sirhan shot him but that he was no longer convinced he killed Kennedy.\n\n\"Kennedy was a man of justice. But, so far, justice has not been served in this case,\" Schrade told the parole board. \"And I feel obliged as both a shooting victim and as an American to speak out about this -- and to honor the memory of the greatest American I've ever known, Robert Francis Kennedy.\"\n\nHe continued, speaking directly to Sirhan: \"The evidence clearly shows you were not the gunman who shot Robert Kennedy. There is clear evidence of a second gunman in that kitchen pantry who shot Robert Kennedy. One of the bullets -- the fatal bullet -- struck Bob in the back of the head. Two bullets struck Bob literally in his back. A fourth bullet struck the back of his coat's upper right seam and passed harmlessly through his coat. I believe all four of those bullets were fired from a second gunman standing behind Bob. You were never behind Bob, nor was Bob's back ever exposed to you.\"\n\nHe then forgave Sirhan for shooting him, and even apologized, saying, \"I should have been here long ago.\"\n\n\"Sirhan, I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you,\" Schrade said as he requested the board to grant parole.\n\nAt the end of the three-hour hearing, the board denied Sirhan parole, finding he had not shown adequate remorse nor understood the gravity of the crime he committed.\n\n\"This crime impacted the nation, and I daresay it impacted the world,\" Parole Board Commissioner Brian Roberts said at the time. \"It was a political assassination of a viable Democratic presidential candidate.\"\n\nSirhan, now 74, is not scheduled for another parole hearing until 2021.\n\nCamelot split on new investigation\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. is picking up where he left off in 2012 -- calling for investigators to reopen the homicide case. It was his letter Schrade read to the parole board.\n\n\"Paul and his team ... strongly believe this new evidence is conclusive and requires a new investigation,\" the letter read. \"I agree and support his request for a new investigation.\"\n\nThe push for a new look at the case has split parts of the family, however. Even though Kathleen Kennedy Townsend agrees with RFK Jr., two other siblings -- Joseph Kennedy II and Kerry Kennedy -- are opposed to opening up fresh wounds, according to the Boston Globe, and would rather people focus on their father's legacy.\n\n\"As we approach the 50th anniversary of my father's passing, I think what is most important is that our country and my family reflect on what my father stood for and fought for -- a legacy promoting global peace, social justice, and civil rights,\" she told the newspaper in a statement.\n\nTheir mom, Ethel Kennedy, \"will not comment\" on the calls for a new probe, the Globe, quoting Kerry Kennedy, reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ethel Kennedy and other members of her family will gather for a ceremony in what is now called the Kennedy Caucus Room at the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., to reflect on RFK's legacy and honor four youth-activist groups with the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. Among the groups honored will be students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, who organized the March for Our Lives rally in Washington in the aftermath of a mass shooting at their school that left 17 people dead.\n\nOn Wednesday, RFK's family will mark the 50th anniversary of his death by gathering at his gravesite at Arlington National Cemetery for a private service. At 10 a.m. Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton is expected to join the Kennedy family for a public service at the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater.\n\nStill, Schrade was optimistic that Kennedy Jr.'s support could help breathe new life into the 50-year-old case.\n\n\"The fact that Robert Kennedy Jr. would say, 'Sirhan did not kill my father,'\" he said, according to the Globe, \"I think that's very effective.\""}, {"url": "https://www.thoughtco.com/robert-kennedy-assassination-1779358", "page_content": "Shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, presidential candidate, Robert F. Kennedy was shot three times after giving a speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, California. Robert Kennedy died of his wounds 26 hours later. Robert Kennedy's assassination later led to Secret Service protection for all future major presidential candidates.\n\nThe Assassination\n\nOn June 4, 1968, popular Democratic Party presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy waited all day for the election results to come in from the Democratic primary in California.\n\nAt 11:30 p.m., Kennedy, his wife Ethel, and the rest of his entourage left the Royal Suite of the Ambassador Hotel and headed downstairs to the ballroom, where approximately 1,800 supporters waited for him to give his victory speech.\n\nAfter giving his speech and ending with, \"Now on to Chicago, and let's win there!\" Kennedy turned and exited the ballroom through a side door that led to a kitchen pantry. Kennedy was using this pantry as a shortcut to reach the Colonial Room, where the press was waiting for him.\n\nAs Kennedy traveled down this pantry corridor, which was filled with people trying to catch a glimpse of the potential future president, 24-year-old, Palestinian-born Sirhan Sirhan stepped up to Robert Kennedy and opened fire with his .22 pistol.\n\nWhile Sirhan was still firing, bodyguards and others tried to contain the gunman; however, Sirhan managed to fire all eight bullets before being subdued.\n\nSix people were hit. Robert Kennedy fell to the floor bleeding. Speechwriter Paul Shrade had been hit in the forehead. Seventeen-year-old Irwin Stroll was hit in the left leg. ABC director William Weisel was hit in the stomach. Reporter Ira Goldstein's hip was shattered. Artist Elizabeth Evans was also grazed on her forehead.\n\nHowever, most of the focus was on Kennedy. As he lay bleeding, Ethel rushed to his side and cradled his head. Busboy Juan Romero brought over some rosary beads and placed them in Kennedy's hand. Kennedy, who had been seriously hurt and looked in pain, whispered, \"Is everybody all right?\"\n\nDr. Stanley Abo quickly examined Kennedy at the scene and discovered a hole just below his right ear.\n\nRobert Kennedy Rushed to the Hospital\n\nAn ambulance first took Robert Kennedy to the Central Receiving Hospital, which was located just 18 blocks away from the hotel. However, since Kennedy needed brain surgery, he was quickly transferred to Good Samaritan Hospital, arriving around 1 a.m. It was here that doctors discovered two additional bullet wounds, one under his right armpit and another just one-and-a-half inches lower.\n\nKennedy underwent three-hour brain surgery, in which doctors removed bone and metal fragments. Over the next few hours, however, Kennedy's condition continued to worsen.\n\nAt 1:44 a.m. on June 6, 1968, Robert Kennedy died from his wounds at age 42.\n\nThe nation was severely shocked at the news of yet another assassination of a major public figure. Robert Kennedy was the third major assassination of the decade, following the murders of Robert's brother, John F. Kennedy, five years earlier and of the great civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. just two months earlier.\n\nRobert Kennedy was buried near his brother, President John F. Kennedy, in Arlington Cemetery.\n\nWhat Happened to Sirhan Sirhan?\n\nOnce police arrived at the Ambassador Hotel, Sirhan was escorted to police headquarters and questioned. At the time, his identity was unknown since he was carrying no identifying papers and refused to give his name. It wasn't until Sirhan's brothers saw a picture of him on TV that the connection was made.\n\nIt turned out that Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was born in Jerusalem in 1944 and emigrated to the U.S. with his parents and siblings when he was 12 years old. Sirhan eventually dropped out of community college and worked a number of odd jobs, including as a groom at the Santa Anita Racetrack.\n\nOnce the police had identified their captive, they searched his house and found handwritten notebooks. Much of what they found written inside was incoherent, but amidst the rambling, they found \"RFK must die\" and \"My determination to eliminate RFK is becoming more [and] more of an unshakable obsession...[He] must be sacrificed for the cause of the poor exploited people.\"\n\nSirhan was given a trial, in which he was tried for murder (of Kennedy) and assault with a deadly weapon (for the others that were shot). Although he pleaded not guilty, Sirhan Sirhan was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death on April 23, 1969.\n\nSirhan was never executed, however, because in 1972 California abolished the death penalty and commuted all death sentences to life in prison. Sirhan Sirhan remains imprisoned in Valley State Prison in Coalinga, California.\n\nConspiracy Theories\n\nJust as in the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., many people believe there was also a conspiracy involved in the murder of Robert Kennedy. For Robert Kennedy's assassination, there seem to be three main conspiracy theories that are based on inconsistencies found in the evidence against Sirhan Sirhan."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-F-Kennedy", "page_content": "Robert F. Kennedy, in full Robert Francis Kennedy, (born November 20, 1925, Brookline, Massachusetts, U.S.\u2014died June 6, 1968, Los Angeles, California), U.S. attorney general and adviser during the administration of his brother Pres. John F. Kennedy (1961\u201363) and later a U.S. senator (1965\u201368). He was son of Rose and Joseph P. Kennedy. He was assassinated while campaigning for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination in 1968.\n\nRobert interrupted his studies at Harvard University to serve in the U.S. Navy during World War II but returned to the university and graduated in 1948. After receiving a law degree from the University of Virginia Law School in 1951, he began his political career in Massachusetts the next year with the management of his brother John\u2019s successful campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robert first came into national prominence in 1953, when he was an assistant counsel to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, headed by Joseph R. McCarthy (he resigned in mid-1953 but returned in 1954 as counsel to the Democratic minority). In 1957 he was chief counsel to the Senate select committee conducting investigations into labour racketeering, which led to his long-standing feud with James R. Hoffa of the Teamsters Union. Kennedy resigned from the committee staff in 1960 to conduct his brother\u2019s campaign for the U.S. presidency. After John won the election, he appointed (1961) Robert attorney general in his cabinet.\n\nMore From Britannica Sirhan Sirhan\n\nOn November 22, 1963, the president was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Kennedy continued to serve as attorney general until he resigned in September 1964. The months after his brother\u2019s death were a desperate time for him. He was stooped by grief and spent long periods staring out windows or walking in the Virginia woods. He had presided over the Department of Justice for 44 months. He had emerged as a statesman of the law, improving the lot of many. Learning on May 20, 1961, that a hostile mob threatened the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., and about 1,200 of his supporters in Montgomery, Alabama, Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals to protect them. In subsequent racial crises he used long telephone sessions to work out the strategies of peace officers in the South. He also led a tough and imaginative drive against organized crime. One of his proudest achievements was assembling the evidence that convicted Hoffa. On Kennedy\u2019s departure from the Department of Justice, The New York Times, which had criticized his appointment three years earlier, said editorially,\n\nHe named excellent men to most key posts, put new vigor into protecting civil rights through administrative action, played a pivotal role in shaping the most comprehensive civil rights law in this century\u2026. Mr. Kennedy has done much to elevate the standard.\n\nHe was the author of The Enemy Within (1960), Just Friends and Brave Enemies (1962), and Pursuit of Justice (1964).\n\nIn November 1964 he was elected U.S. senator from New York. Within two years Kennedy had established himself as a major political figure in his own right. He became the chief spokesman for liberal Democrats and a critic of Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Vietnam policy. On March 16, 1968, he announced his candidacy for the presidency. By June 4 he had won five out of six presidential primaries, including one that day in California. Shortly after midnight on June 5 he spoke to his followers in Los Angeles\u2019 Ambassador Hotel. As he left through a kitchen hallway, he was fatally wounded by a Palestinian immigrant, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan.

Kennedy was shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles shorty after claiming victory in the California and South Dakota presidential primaries. Sen. Kennedy was gunned down as he walked through the hotel kitchen and died 26 hours later at Good Samaritan Hospital.\n\nDecades after the assassination, CBS News correspondent Michelle Miller finally found proof to back up her late father's claims that he rushed to the fallen senator's side, minutes after the shooting took place. Prompted by her son to find evidence of his grandfather's role in history, Miller discovered that her father, Dr. Ross Miller, was indeed at the Ambassador Hotel that night as a delegate from Compton and was interviewed by CBS News about his efforts to save Kennedy and five others injured in the shooting.\n\n\"My father campaigned for Kennedy and became his delegate. ... He believed the senator was the best hope for bridging the nation's economic and racial divide. He and hundreds of supporters were celebrating Kennedy's victory in the California primary,\" Miller explained.\n\nAfter a desperate plea for \"a doctor in the house\" rang out from the podium, Dr. Miller, a trauma surgeon, rushed backstage to help.\n\nIn a 1968 interview just hours after the shooting, Dr. Miller described the scene that unfolded in the minutes after the shooting to CBS News correspondent Terry Drinkwater.\n\n\"There was massive blood. And he had head injuries,\" Miller said, \"The extent of them could not be ascertained immediately.\"\n\nDr. Miller said Robert Kennedy's wife, Ethel, was \"obviously ... terribly upset.\"\n\n\"I thought she handled herself excellently. She was not in a state of panic. She was deeply concerned about her husband,\" he said.\n\nPaul Shrade, a union official who shared the stage with the senator minutes earlier, was the first to go down in the shooting, wounded from a gunshot to the head.\n\nMiller told Drinkwater that he knew of two others who were hit and said, \"I also took care of Paul Schrade.\"\n\nSchrade was drifting in out of consciousness and has virtually no memory of that night. CBS News archival footage shows Dr. Miller describing the extent of his injuries.\n\n\"He had a deep laceration of the forehead. And although he had a great deal of blood loss and there was a lot of blood around. Apparently his injuries are not critical,\" Miller said.\n\nSchrade recently told Michelle Miller that the archived interview \"is a real surprise for me, because you know, I didn't see him, for one thing. But now you know that he was there and helping. How can I express my gratitude for that, except to say you had a great father.\"\n\nIn all, there were six shooting victims at the Ambassador Hotel -- including journalists Ira Goldstein and William Weisel, Democratic activist Elizabeth Evans and Kennedy campaign volunteer Irwin Stroll. Everyone except Kennedy survived.\n\nDespite his critical role in tending to the injured, virtually none of the photographs from that night showed Dr. Miller in action. Michelle Miller spoke to photographer Bill Eppridge, who took many of the iconic images of the fallout. The photographer shared his unpublished photos with CBS News and Michelle Miller identified her father in a picture inside the Good Samaritan Hospital.\n\n\"Finally, the photographic proof that my dad actually did what he said,\" Miller said, adding, \"My family history [is] forever intertwined with the night that may have changed the course of American history.\""}, {"url": "https://abc7.com/robert-f-kennedy-rfk-assassination-good-samaritan-hospital/3570647/", "page_content": "Robert F.

Robert Francis Kennedy was forty-two when he was shot down in Los Angeles. The seventh child of his family and the great-grandson of Irish immigrants in the previous century, he would succeed his brother John F. as leader of the dynasty. On November 22nd, 1963, he was having a swim and lunch with his wife Ethel at their grand mansion in McLean, Virginia, when FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover telephoned to tell him that President Kennedy had been shot.\n\nElected as a Democratic senator for the state of New York in 1964, Robert Kennedy announced his candidature for the presidency in 1968. He would win four out of five Democratic primaries and it looked as if he might well be the second Kennedy president when he went to California for the primary there. Among cheering crowds in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown with Ethel on June 3rd, the sound of shots rang out. It was an ominous moment, but they turned out to be firecrackers. Later that day the senator spoke in Los Angeles and San Diego before spending the night in Malibu, north of Los Angeles.\n\nThe next day, voting day in the primary, it was foggy and cold. Kennedy played with his children on the beach before being driven in the evening to a suite in the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles to await the results. News of his victory came in and around midnight he went down to the hotel ballroom to speak to a crowd of supporters gathered there. He had left the ballroom by a crowded passageway, shaking hands with supporters and hotel staff, when a man stepped out in front of him and fired shots from a .22 calibre revolver at the Senator and his entourage, hitting him at close range in the head and body, and wounding five others as well. The assassin was seized, but it was too late and Robert Kennedy was taken to the Good Samaritan Hospital, where he died the next day.\n\nFlown to New York for the funeral in St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, the body was then taken by special train to Washington DC, past enormous grieving crowds, and Robert Kennedy was buried at dead of night, close to his brother John in the Arlington National Cemetery. The assassin proved to be a Palestinian from Beirut named Sirhan Sirhan, aged twenty-four, whose Christian family had emigrated to California and settled in Pasadena in 1956. At his trial he maintained that he had acted in revenge for Kennedy\u2019s pro-Israeli sympathies. He was sentenced to death in 1969, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment three years later.

Kennedy was shot and mortally wounded after claiming victory in California\u2019s Democratic presidential primary at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles; assassin Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was arrested at the scene.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1794, Congress passed the Neutrality Act, which prohibited Americans from taking part in any military action against a country that was at peace with the United States.\n\nIn 1950, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Henderson v. United States, struck down racially segregated railroad dining cars.\n\nIn 1967, war erupted in the Middle East as Israel, anticipating a possible attack by its Arab neighbors, launched a series of pre-emptive airfield strikes that destroyed nearly the entire Egyptian air force; Syria, Jordan and Iraq immediately entered the conflict.\n\nIn 1975, Egypt reopened the Suez Canal to international shipping, eight years after it was closed because of the 1967 war with Israel.\n\nIn 1976, 14 people were killed when the Teton Dam in Idaho burst.\n\nIn 1981, the Centers for Disease Control reported that five homosexuals in Los Angeles had come down with a rare kind of pneumonia; they were the first recognized cases of what later became known as AIDS.\n\nIn 2002, 14-year-old Elizabeth Smart was abducted from her Salt Lake City home. (Smart was found alive by police in a Salt Lake suburb in March 2003. One kidnapper, Brian David Mitchell, is serving a prison sentence; the other, Wanda Barzee, was released in September 2018.)\n\nIn 2004, Ronald Wilson Reagan, the 40th president of the United States, died in Los Angeles at age 93 after a long struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nIn 2006, more than 50 National Guardsmen from Utah became the first unit to work along the U.S.-Mexico border as part of President George W. Bush\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\nIn 2013, U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, accused of killing 16 Afghan civilians, many of them sleeping women and children, pleaded guilty to murder at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, to avoid the death penalty; he was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIn 2016, Novak Djokovic (NOH\u2019-vak JOH\u2019-kuh-vich) became the first man in nearly a half-century to win four consecutive major championships and finally earned an elusive French Open title to complete a career Grand Slam, beating Andy Murray 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-4.\n\nIn 2020, Minneapolis banned chokeholds by police, the first of many changes in police practices to be announced in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death; officers would also now be required to intervene any time they saw unauthorized force by another officer. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league had been wrong for not listening to players fighting for racial equality."}, {"url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/robert-f-kennedy-assassinated-june-5-1968-223826", "page_content": "Kennedy was buried later that day at Arlington National Cemetery.

Kennedy was killed by an assassin. In what is now the first study of its kind, a team of specialists has conducted a systematic review of the medical care he received during the critical hours following the shooting. Their findings offer unprecedented details about that tragic night, while also dispelling myths that have fueled conspiracy theories for years.\n\nOn June 6, 1968, the same night he gave his victory speech at the California Democratic Party presidential primary, Kennedy, age 42, was shot three times. He would ultimately succumb to his injuries 26 hours later in a Los Angeles hospital. Much has been said and written about the assassination over the years\u2014including some outlandish conspiracy theories\u2014but surprisingly, no one has ever taken the time to conduct a medical review of RFK\u2019s injuries or assess the quality of his treatment. A new study published today in the Journal of Neurosurgery is now the first to do so, providing an unprecedented, yet grim, overview of the events leading to RFK\u2019s death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA research team from Duke University School of Medicine, led by Jordan M. Komisarow, reviewed a number of sources while conducting its review, including eyewitness accounts, various medical records, and the autopsy report itself. In the final analysis, the authors say there\u2019s nothing more doctors could have done to save Kennedy\u2019s life, despite a 45-minute delay in getting the senator to the hospital. RFK was treated according to the medical standards of the time, including an emergency craniotomy similar to ones performed today. And importantly, the autopsy report corroborates eyewitness accounts, dispelling a conspiracy theory that suggests more than one gunman was involved in the shooting.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAfter giving his victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, RFK walked through the hotel kitchen to meet with the press in the Colonial Room. Kennedy had a small security detail, but nothing on the scale of what such a prominent figure would have today. While walking through the crowded kitchen, and as he was turning to shake hands with a busboy, the assassin, Sirhan Sirhan, stepped in front of Kennedy, firing eight shots with his .22-caliber Iver Johnson Cadet revolver. At 12:15 am local time, three bullets struck RFK, one in the head and two in his upper body. Five people standing nearby were also hit, suffering non-fatal injuries.\n\n\n\nKennedy fell immediately to the floor, and a crowd of people cried out for help. No fewer than five physicians were in attendance at the California presidential primary, including a trauma surgeon. Within minutes of the shooting, the senator was already receiving medical care. RFK was in a semi-conscious state, lying on the kitchen floor for 17 minutes as paramedics were en route. His left eye was shut, his right eye open, but with the pupil shifted to the right. Kennedy was still able to move all four of his limbs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut then Kennedy began to lose consciousness, prompting one of the doctors, a radiologist named Stanley Abo, to examine the senator\u2019s head wound. A small blood clot had formed at the site of the bullet hole, so Abo inserted his finger into the hole to disrupt the clot. \u201cWith that action, the clot dislodged, blood flowed freely from the bullet hole, and Kennedy\u2019s consciousness briefly improved,\u201d the authors write.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy 12:32 am, RFK was on a stretcher and on his way to LA\u2019s Central Receiving Hospital, arriving at 12:45 am. He was immediately cared for by Dr. V. Faustin Bazilauskas. At this stage, Kennedy\u2019s gaze became fixed, he wasn\u2019t breathing, and his pulse was almost impossible to detect. The medical staff hooked him up to an IV, inserted an oral airway, placed a respirator mask on his face, and started compressions, which went on for 10 minutes. They also gave him some adrenaline and other medications. Eventually, the senator\u2019s blood pressure returned. It soon became obvious to Bazilauskas and his colleague Dr. Albert Holt that they weren\u2019t able to offer the care required to treat Kennedy\u2019s injuries, so they transferred him to the Good Samaritan Hospital. As the authors of the new study point out, the delay in getting the senator to the appropriate hospital was the biggest mistake made that evening\u2014a problem caused when the initial call for ambulance was made, and the nature of Kennedy\u2019s injuries was not fully disclosed.\n\n\u201cIf the dispatcher had known the injury was a gunshot to the head, the ambulance driver would likely have been instructed to bypass the smaller hospital and go directly to the nearby 400-bed Good Samaritan Hospital,\u201d write the researchers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat said, the Good Samaritan hospital was just two blocks away, and as the authors admit, the delay ultimately didn\u2019t have an effect on the final outcome.\n\nOnce at the ICU unit of the new hospital and placed under the care of Drs. Paul A. Ironside and Hubert Humble, RFK was disrobed so that his other two wounds could be inspected. He had a gunshot wound on the right side of his back, with X-rays showing a bullet lodged in his neck; the injury was not considered life threatening. He also had a wound on his right shoulder, but no other bullets were found lodged within his body.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe senator was now in very bad shape, and he was no longer responding to pain. At 2:45 am, Kennedy was transferred to the operating room where he received an emergency craniotomy. In 1968, doctors did not have the benefit of modern medical tools such as computed tomography (CT) scans, but they did have X-rays, and they were able to perform brain surgery, and in a manner similar to how it\u2019s still done today.\n\nOver the course of the three hour and 45 minute long craniotomy, the doctors worked to remove as many bits of bone and bullet fragments as possible. After the surgery, RFK regained some motor activity on the right side of his body, as shown by his response to a pin prick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his brief postoperative phase, several specialists around the US were consulted. All agreed that the senator was in grave shape, and that in the event he somehow managed to survive the brain injury, he would remain in a severely compromised neurological condition.\n\nRFK remained relatively stable in the hours following the surgery, but by 6:00 pm on June 5, about 12 hours after the craniotomy, his condition began to deteriorate. The pressure in his brain began to rise, his electroencephalogram readings became flat, and he stopped breathing. Kennedy never regained consciousness, and he was pronounced dead at 1:44 am local time on June 6, 1968.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe doctors had worked feverishly to save his life, but death was not unexpected. Aside from the 45-minute delay in getting Kennedy to the Good Samaritan Hospital, the authors found no faults with the care administered to the senator. \u201cIt is the authors\u2019 opinion that Senator Kennedy received aggressive and appropriate care in line with the standard of the day,\u201d write the authors in the study. What\u2019s more, if the shooting happened today, Kennedy would still have died, the authors state. The only differences between the care Kennedy received in 1968 and the care he would have received today include postoperative monitoring and the types of medications used.\n\nAccording to Kennedy\u2019s autopsy report, the senator suffered extensive injuries to his right cerebellum (the part responsible for motor control) and right occipital lobe (required for visual processing). The report also noted damage to the brainstem, and evidence of hemorrhaging both inside and outside of the skull. Bone and bullet fragments, despite the surgery, were found lodged in tissue throughout the brain. Powder burns suggested the gun was fired at point blank range, no less than three inches away from the senator. As the authors note in the study, this should put conspiracy theories to rest about an alleged second shooter:\n\nThis is despite the fact that many people witnessed the shooting. Much has been made of the fact that the assassin approached Kennedy from the front, but the gunshot wounds were in the back. Several witnesses documented that Kennedy\u2019s head was turned to his left as he was shot, which explains the trajectory of the bullets. In addition, witnesses claim that Sirhan came no closer than a foot from Kennedy when the shooting occurred, but the autopsy report estimates that the gun was within inches of the skin based on the presence of gunpowder in the wound. The same witnesses did not see another shooter. Despite concern over the trajectory of the bullet and controversy about gunpowder on the skin, there was never clear evidence of conspiracy and Sirhan was ruled the lone gunman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSirhan, a Christian Jordanian of Palestinian descent, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, though his sentence was later commuted to life in prison. Writing in his diary, Sirhan wrote that \u201cKennedy must die\u201d owing to his support of Israel.\n\nHubert Humphrey would go on to win the Democratic nomination, with Republican Richard Nixon winning the presidential election. These were trying times for the United States. Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated just two months before RFK, and the country was mired in a the very unpopular Vietnam War. Four years later, the Watergate scandal would rock the nation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica is no stranger to tumultuous times, as these new examinations of history continue to remind us.\n\n[Journal of Neurosurgery]"}, {"url": "https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/05/29/Hospital-where-Robert-Kennedy-died-rich-in-other-history/4136486187200/", "page_content": "LOS ANGELES -- In the wee hours of June 5, 1968, a startled, heartsick nation turned its eyes to Good Samaritan Hospital as two surgeons worked frantically on the ninth floor to remove a bullet from the brain of the dying Robert F.

It became a nightmarish symbol of the turbulent '60s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than 4,000 people gathered that night on street corners outside the hospital near downtown Los Angeles.\n\nMany silently lit candles. Some spoke tearfully about the country's violent plight while the 42-year-old senator -- cut down at the most triumphal moment in his quest for the presidency -- slowly retreated toward death.\n\nAt 1:43 a.m. June 6, Kennedy died inside a 40-foot-long, green-tiled intensive care unit on the fifth floor, nowthe site of the hospital's print shop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe ninth floor surgical unit is now just a heap of outdated equipment scattered randomly in darkened corridors. And the two neurosurgeons, Dr. Henry Cuneo, who pronounced Kennedy dead, and his assistant, Dr. Nathan Reid, have both died.\n\nThe Good Samaritan Hospital turned a century old this year, carrying a load of Hollywood history aside from its involvement with the Kennedy assassination.\n\nAt the 411-bed, marble and beige stucco edifice, Spencer Tracy waged a quiet battle for survival in the fall of 1965 following a prostate operation.\n\nJohn Wayne was treated for lung cancer here, and Buckminster Fuller, the inventor and philosopher, suffered a heart attack and died at the hospital while visiting his sick wife.\n\nJames Cagney recuperated here following a stroke. Hollywood sex legend Mae West languished here in 1980 when she suffered a stroke at age 88.\n\nHoward Hughes was often treated at Good Samaritan, and when he died authorities searched the hospital for clues to the whereabouts of his will.\n\nLittle is known about the founder of The Hospital of the Good Samaritan, its actual name. She was known simply as Sister Mary, an Episcopalian missionary who came to Los Angeles from San Francisco in 1885.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hospital began in a rented house with beds for seven patients. Good Samaritan moved to its present location on Sixth Street in 1911, and the new hospital building was erected in 1976.\n\nOn June 2, the hospital will celebrate its centennial with a reunion of babies born at Good Samaritan the past 100 years. More than 1,300 people are expected to converge on the hospital's parking lot for the birthday gala.\n\nThe oldest 'baby' attending is 80 years old, said hospital administrator Geneva Clymer. ---\n\nClymer was nursing director during that awful spring night in 1968. She remembers it as if it were yesterday.\n\n'I was at home when the phone rang. It was late. I turned on the TV and saw all these people milling around in the hospital,' Clymer recalled. 'I took a shower and got down there, and the police wouldn't let me cross Sixth Street ... I saw him (Kennedy) in intensive care. I, well, you just can't put it into words.'\n\nThere's now a paper-folding machine and booklet stitcher on the spot where Kennedy took his last breath. The track remains where the white curtains were pulled in a semicircle around the dying senator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 17-year-old youth works several feet away on another printing machine.
