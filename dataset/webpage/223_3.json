He was 81.\n\nKurowski, who lived in Shillington, had been in failing health since suffering a stroke after heart bypass surgery in July, according to his wife, Joan.\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 5, 1942, a remarkable stretch of World Series success for the Yankees came to an end with one swing by a rookie infielder. George (Whitey) Kurowski's two-run home run off Red Ruffing into the left-field stands at Yankee Stadium in the ninth inning of Game 5 propelled the Cardinals to a 4-2 victory and a Series title, the first time the Yankees had been beaten in nine trips to the Series since they were defeated by the Cards in 1926.\n\nThat Kurowski was even in a major league uniform defied the odds. When he was growing up in Reading, Pa., he fell off a fence and landed in broken glass, severely cutting his right arm. Two years later, he began suffering severe pain and was found to have developed osteomyelitis, a bone inflammation. Three inches of bone above his wrist were surgically removed, leaving the arm weakened and with an unnatural bend. He strengthened his arm muscles as he embarked on a baseball career, but his right arm, his throwing arm, had become shorter than his left."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kurowwh01.shtml", "page_content": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhen was Whitey Kurowski born?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was born on April 19, 1918.\n\nWhere was Whitey Kurowski born?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was born in Reading, PA.\n\nHow tall was Whitey Kurowski?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was 5-11 (180 cm) tall.\n\nHow much did Whitey Kurowski weigh when playing?\n\nWhitey Kurowski weighed 193 lbs (87 kg) when playing.\n\nHow many seasons did Whitey Kurowski play?\n\nWhitey Kurowski played 9 seasons.\n\nIs Whitey Kurowski in the Hall of Fame?\n\nWhitey Kurowski has not been elected into the Hall of Fame.\n\nWhat position did Whitey Kurowski play?\n\nWhitey Kurowski was a Third Baseman.\n\nHow many hits did Whitey Kurowski have?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had 925 hits over his career.\n\nHow many home runs did Whitey Kurowski have?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had 106 home runs over his career.\n\nWhat was Whitey Kurowski's average?\n\nWhitey Kurowski had a .286 average over his career.\n\nHow many teams has Whitey Kurowski played for?\n\nWhitey Kurowski played for 1 team, the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nHow many World Series has Whitey Kurowski won?\n\nWhitey Kurowski won 3 World Series.\n\nWhen did Whitey Kurowski retire?\n\nWhitey Kurowski last played in 1949."}, {"url": "https://retrosimba.com/2018/08/10/johnny-lewis-from-pupil-to-mentor-with-cardinals/", "page_content": "Johnny Lewis, a prospect considered to have more potential than Lou Brock, overcame personal tragedy, rebounded from setbacks in his playing career and became a pioneering coach for the Cardinals.\n\nLewis was an outfielder with a strong throwing arm, speed and a powerful hitting stroke. He got to the major leagues with the Cardinals in 1964 and was given prominent playing time in right field the first two months of the season, but by June he was back in the minor leagues.\n\nTraded to the Mets two months after the Cardinals won the 1964 World Series championship, Lewis played three more seasons in the major leagues before returning to the Cardinals and building a second career with them as an administrator, coach, manager and instructor.\n\nHeavy heart\n\nLewis was born in Greenville, Ala., and moved to Pensacola, Fla., as a toddler. At 19, he entered the Cardinals\u2019 organization in 1959.\n\nAdvancing through the St. Louis system, Lewis played his best for manager Whitey Kurowski, a former Cardinals third baseman. Lewis played for Kurowski at Winnipeg in 1960 and at Tulsa in 1961 and 1962. In 1960, Lewis hit .299 with 23 home runs and 104 RBI for Winnipeg and he followed that with a .293 batting mark, 22 home runs and 85 RBI for Tulsa in 1961.\n\nWhile in the minor leagues, Lewis got married and he and his wife, Ola Mae, began raising a family. In the winters, Lewis played baseball in the Dominican Republic and Venezuela.\n\nLewis, 22, was in Venezuela when his wife was killed in an automobile crash in the United States.\n\n\u201cMy wife went to a church convention and on the way back the car she was in got into an accident and all five people in it were killed,\u201d Lewis said to Milton Gross of the North American Newspaper Alliance. \u201cI came back from Venezuela and there I was with two little babies, one wasn\u2019t a year old, and I said to myself, \u2018What do I do now?\u2019\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to quit baseball, get a job, stay home and take care of the babies, but my mother said she\u2019d take care of them. She\u2019s a good woman, my mother, and I got to keep remembering that my babies are with somebody who loves them.\u201d\n\nSpring sensation\n\nIn 1964, Lewis, 24, reported to spring training with the Cardinals and competed with several other prospects, including Mike Shannon, for an outfield spot. Lewis played splendidly in the exhibition games, hitting .333, and was named the Cardinals\u2019 top prospect in a poll of writers and broadcasters.\n\nStan Musial, who became a club executive after retiring as a player, called Lewis the Cardinals\u2019 \u201cbest outfield prospect since Bill Virdon,\u201d who won the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 1955.\n\nThe Sporting News described Lewis\u2019 success as \u201cthe Cinderella epic of the spring.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anybody like him in the last 10 years,\u201d Cardinals manager Johnny Keane said.\n\nLewis \u201crates high in all five categories. He can run, throw, field, hit and also hit for power,\u201d Keane said to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nAccording to Keane, the five-tool players in the National League in 1964 were Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Vada Pinson and Roberto Clemente.\n\nLearning curve\n\nLewis was shy and quiet and his teammates nicknamed him \u201cGabby\u201d because he said so little, the Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nCardinals first baseman Bill White, who became Lewis\u2019 mentor, said, \u201cWhat we got to do is make Lewis think more aggressively, but it will take time. He knows nothing but Florida, where he\u2019s lived, and Alabama, where he was born. Where could he have learned anything else?\u201d\n\nAs the season neared, Keane decided to platoon Lewis and Carl Warwick in right field. Lewis, a left-handed batter, would play against right-handed pitchers and Warwick, who batted right-handed, would play against left-handers.\n\nThough Lewis had the talent, some offered caution.\n\n\u201cLewis has all the potential, but the boy has an inferiority complex,\u201d Cardinals consultant Branch Rickey told The Sporting News. \u201cI wish he\u2019d believe in himself as much as all of us believe in him.\u201d\n\nSaid third baseman Ken Boyer: \u201cThe kid should be a good player. I just hope they don\u2019t expect him to break down the fences the first few years.\u201d\n\nShort stay\n\nOn April 15, 1964, Lewis got his first big-league hit, a RBI-single against Don Drysdale of the Dodgers. Boxscore Three days later, on April 18, Lewis slugged his first big-league home run, a solo shot against Bobby Bolin of the Giants. Boxscore\n\nLewis hit .207 in April and .278 in May. On June 10, he injured an ankle and had to leave the game. Three days later, on June 13, the Cardinals acquired outfielder Bob Skinner from the Pirates and sent Lewis to their Jacksonville farm team. Lewis hit .234 in 40 games for St. Louis, making 28 starts in right field.\n\nOn June 15, the Cardinals made another trade, getting outfielder Lou Brock from the Cubs.\n\n\u201cWe hope Brock will fill the category of one of our regular outfielders until someone in the future, perhaps Johnny Lewis, comes along,\u201d Cardinals general manager Bing Devine said to The Sporting News.\n\nIn an interview with the Post-Dispatch, Devine said, \u201cI feel Lewis probably has more potential than Brock. He fields better and he throws better.\u201d\n\nBrock, however, took hold of the left field job and Shannon, recalled from the minors, became the right fielder. Meanwhile, Lewis floundered at Jacksonville until an X-ray on Aug. 6 revealed he had a hairline fracture of his ankle. Lewis \u201chad been bothered by the ankle for some time,\u201d The Sporting News reported.\n\nIn September, after Lewis returned to the lineup and helped Jacksonville win the International League championship, he was called up to the Cardinals but didn\u2019t get into a game. The Cardinals clinched the National League pennant on the last day of the season and won four of seven games against the Yankees in the World Series.\n\nMeet the Mets\n\nThe Cardinals tried converting Lewis into a switch-hitter at the Florida Instructional League in October 1964, but the experiment failed. On Dec. 7, 1964, the Cardinals traded Lewis and pitcher Gordon Richardson to the Mets for pitcher Tracy Stallard and infielder Elio Chacon. Devine, fired by the Cardinals in August 1964, had joined the Mets as assistant to president George Weiss and advocated for Lewis.\n\n\u201cPlaying with the Cardinals, it was a case of making good instantly or you were gone,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them for that. They were pennant contenders and they couldn\u2019t afford to wait, but for me it meant I always was more conscious of making mistakes. I couldn\u2019t take chances. I was constantly tight.\u201d\n\nLewis hit .245 with 15 home runs in 148 games for the 1965 Mets. On June 14, 1965, he broke up a no-hit bid by the Reds\u2019 Jim Maloney with a home run in the 11th inning at Cincinnati. Boxscore\n\nAfter the 1965 season, Lewis remarried. However, while his personal life improved, his playing career declined. He played parts of two more seasons with the Mets, batting .193 in 1966 and .118 in 1967, and finished with a year in the minors in 1968.\n\nSecond career\n\nBy 1970, Devine was back with the Cardinals as general manager and he gave Lewis a chance to return to St. Louis, too. Lewis was hired to be Cardinals assistant promotions and sales director and he spent two years (1970-71) in the role.\n\nIn 1972, Lewis became administrative coordinator of player development and scouting for the Cardinals.\n\nAfter a year in that job, Lewis became the first African-American to serve on the Cardinals\u2019 coaching staff. Lewis was the Cardinals\u2019 first-base coach on manager Red Schoendienst\u2019s staff for four seasons (1973-76).\n\nFor the next five years (1977-81), Lewis was a Cardinals\u2019 minor-league manager at Calgary (1977-78), Gastonia (1979) and Johnson City (1980-81). Among the future major-leaguers managed by Lewis were pitchers Danny Cox and outfielders Curt Ford and Stan Javier.\n\nFrom 1982-84, Lewis was a Cardinals\u2019 minor-league hitting instructor.\n\nIn 1985, Lewis became the hitting coach for the Cardinals and was a special mentor to rookie speedster Vince Coleman. Lewis was the hitting coach on manager Whitey Herzog\u2019s staff for five seasons (1985-89) and the Cardinals won two National League pennants in that time. Another Lewis pupil, Willie McGee, won the NL Most Valuable Player Award and the league batting title in 1985.\n\nFrom 1990-98, Lewis was a Cardinals minor-league hitting instructor. He finished his career as the minor-league hitting coordinator for the Astros from 1999-2001."}, {"url": "https://baseballroundtable.com/baseball-roundtables-all-polish-american-team/", "page_content": "by\n\nIf are Milwaukee-born (particularly into the Karpinski family), you are very likely to be a baseball fan and proud of your Polish heritage. (I learned a great deal about both from my Aunt Irene.) With that in mind, this post will be dedicated to my personally selected Polish-American MLB All Star squad \u2013 one player at each position in the field, two starting pitchers (a lefty and a righty) and two relievers (again, a right-hander and a southpaw).\n\nThe team I came up with looks pretty competitive. The twelve players played a combined 204 major leagues seasons (none fewer than nine). The lineup includes six MLB Hall of Famers. Together, this dozen major leaguers garnered 79 All Star selections, 24 Gold Gloves and 12 batting titles. They also can point to four Most Valuable Player Awards and one Triple Crown. In addition, eleven of the twelve have been inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in Orchard Lake Village, Michigan.\n\nNote: For a look at an All Star squad picked on the basis of the ability to handle Nolan Ryan\u2019s heat, click here.\n\nWe\u2019ll go through the All Star Squad first, but there are a couple of special mentions (detailed at the end of the post): 1) Moe Drabowsky \u2013 The best-ever major leaguer actually born in Poland; and Art \u201cPinky\u201d Deras \u2013 the Polish-American youngster acknowledged as the Best Little League Player Ever (there\u2019s even a documentary about him). So, let\u2019s get to it.\n\n\u2014\u2013THE BASEBALL ROUNDTABLE POLISH-AMERICAN ALL STAR TEAM\u2014\u2013\n\nCatcher \u2013 A.J. Pierzynski\n\nI\u2019ve got a special spot in my heart for the catcher on my All Polish-American squad \u2013 a hard-nosed player who started his MLB career with my Minnesota Twins. A.J. Pierzynski was a consistent and quality performer who always came to win\n\n_______________________________________\n\nIf you played against him, you hated him. If you played with him, you hated him a little less \u2026. He\u2019s worth the work because he always shows up for you.\u201d\n\nOzzie Guillen, Manager, Chicago White Sox\n\n__________________________________\n\nPierzynski, signed by the Twins out of high school in 1994, made his MLB debut with Minnesota (as a 21-year-old) in 1998. The 6\u20193\u201d/250-pound, left-handed hitter (right-handed thrower) played in 19 MLB seasons \u2013 for the Twins (1998-2003); Giants (2004); White Sox (2005-2012); Rangers (2013); Red Sox (2014); Cardinals (2014); and Braves (2015-16).\n\nPierzynski was a two-time All Star. He collected 2,043 hits in 2,059 games (for a .280 career average), hit 188 home runs and drove in 909. His best season came with the Twins in 2003, when he hit .312, with 11 home runs and 74 RBI (although he did hit a career-high 27 home runs for the White Sox in 2012). He ranks eighth all time in games played at catcher. He holds the AL record for most consecutive games (by a catcher) in a season without an error at 117 in 2005 (tied with Buddy Rosar, Athletics, 1946). Pierzynski was about as steady at the plate as you can get. For his career, he hit .280:\n\n.283 at home \u2013 .277 on the road\n\n.282 in the first-half of the season; .278 in the second half.\n\n.287 with runners on base; .287 with runners in scoring position; .275 with the bases empty.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nFirst Base \u2013 Ted Kluszewski\n\nTed \u201cBig Klu\u201d Kluszewski was a rare breed \u2013 a true power hitter who also practiced exceptional plate discipline. In 1954, for example, Kluszewski hit .326, with 49 home runs and 141 RBI \u2013 a season made even more remarkable by the fact he struck out only 35 times (versus 78 walks). I doubt if we\u2019ll ever see another player top 40 home runs without reaching 40 whiffs. Kluszewski, in fact, had a streak of four seasons (1953-56) when he hit over .300, drove in 100+ runs, bashed 35+ home runs \u2013 and struck out no more than 40 times in any season. In those four seasons, Kluszewski hit 171 home runs \u2013 and fanned 140 times (average 43 HR\u2019s and 35 whiffs a season). It should also be noted that Kluszewski led NL first baseman in fielding percentage every year from 1951 through 1955. Unfortunately, a back injury in 1956 hampered his performance in the later years of his career (he played until 1961). He played for the Reds (1947-1957); Pirates (1958-59); White Sox (1959-60); and Angels (1961).\n\nKluszewski \u2013 a big man for his time at 6\u20192\u201d/225-pounds \u2013 is also noted for adding a bit of flair to the game, making his own intimidating fashion statement. Big Klu complained that his uniform jersey was too tight for his large and powerful biceps. He went on to have the sleeves cut from his jersey \u2013 exposing his bare arms from the shoulder. (This was considered a bold move at that very conforming time in the game\u2019s history.)\n\nKluszewski only appeared in one post-season \u2013 hitting .391, with three homers and ten RBI in the 1958 World Series (for the White Sox). True to his form \u2013 Big Klu did not strike out even once (25 plate appearance) in the Series.\n\nBig Klu was an Angel Taken by the Angels in the 1960 expansion draft, Kluszewski hit the first-ever home run for the expansion team (a two-run shot in the first inning of the Angels\u2019 first game \u2013 April 11 versus the Orioles). He added a punctuation mark, by hitting the Angels\u2019 second\u2013ever home run (a three-run shot) the very next inning. The Angels won 7-2 and, of course, Kluszewski did not strikeout.\n\nThe big left-hander hit .298 over his 15-season MLB career, with 279 home runs and 1,028 RBI. The four-time All Star topped .300 in seven seasons, drove in 100+ runs in four seasons and hit 40 or more long balls in three campaigns. His best season was 1954, when he hit .326-49-141. Ultimately, however, Big Klu is best remembered for those sleeveless jerseys, muscular arms and exceptional bat control.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nSecond Base \u2013 Bill Mazeroski\n\nConsidered the best fielding second baseman of all time by many, Bill Mazeroski was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001.He played 17 MLB seasons \u2013 all with the Pirates \u2013 hitting .260, with 138 home runs and 853 RBI. It was, however, his glove the earned him a spot on this squad. \u201cMaz\u201d was a seven-time All Star and an eight-time Gold Glover at the keystone sack. He led NL second baseman in assists nine times, putouts five times and double plays turned eight times. (He is the all-time career leader in double plays by a second baseman, fifth in assists, seventh in puts and tenth in games played at the two-bag. The 5\u201911\u201d/183-pound right-hander\u2019s best season at the plate was probably 1962, when he hit .271, with 14 home runs and 81 RBI.\n\nBill Mazeroski is best remembered for two things \u2013 his unmatched skill at turning the double play and his walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game Seven of the 1960 World Series \u2013 which gave the Pirates a 10-9 win and an unlikely World Championship. In the Series, the Yankees outhit the Pirates .338 to .256, out-homered the Pirates 10 to four and outscored Pittsburgh 55 to 27. Mazeroski hit .320 in the seven-game set, smacked two of the Pirates\u2019 four home runs and drove in five tallies. Bobby Richardson of the losing Yankees hit .367 and drove in 12 runs to win the Series MVP Award \u2013 still the only player on a losing team to take home the World Series MVP Trophy.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nThird Base \u2013 George Kurowksi\n\nGeorge \u201cWhitey\u201d Kurowski played in nine MLB seasons (1941-49), all for the Cardinals. In the six seasons that he played at least 100 games, he was an All Star four times. In the three seasons from 1945 to 1947, Kurowski hit .311, with 62 home runs and 295 RBI. For his career, he hit .286 (in 916 games), with 106 home runs and 529 RBI. He led NL third baseman in putouts in three seasons, as well as in assists and doubles plays once each. He finished in the top ten in home runs in the league five times, RBI four times and batting average three times. His best season was 1947, when he hit .310, with 27 home runs, 104 RBI and 108 runs scored.\n\nWhitey Kurowski had to overcome the effects of a childhood injury and osteomyelitis in his right (throwing) arm in his quest to reach the major leagues. The surgery required to save his arm left his right wing about three inches inches shorter than his left. His determination is reflected in the fact that he made the major leagues as a third basemen \u2013 a position the demands a strong throwing arm. Arm problems most likely shortened his career. (The Society for American baseball Research reports Kurowski \u201cunderwent 13 operations on the arm so he could continue playing.)\n\n_________________________________________________\n\nShortstop \u2013 Alan Trammell\n\nThe shortstop selection for this team \u2013 Alan Trammell \u2013 was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2019. The 6\u2019/165-pound Trammell (a right-hander) was a Tigers\u2019 second round draft pick right out of high school in 1976. He made his MLB debut in September of 1977 and went on to play 20 MLB seasons \u2013 all for the Tigers.\n\nTrammell was a six-time All Star and a four-time Gold Glover. Over his career, he collected 2,365 hits (.285 average), with 185 home runs, 1,003 RBI, 1,231 runs scored and 236 stolen bases. He hit over .300 seven times (a high of .343 in 1987), hit 20 or more home runs twice, scored 100+ runs in three seasons and stole 20 or more bases three times. His best season was 1987, when Trammell hit .343, collected 205 hits, knocked 28 home runs, drove in 105 and scored 109.\n\nAllen Trammell (SS) and Lou Whitaker (2B) played together for 19 seasons \u2013 MLB\u2019s longest every SS-2B teammates run.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nHonorable Mention at Shortstop \u2013 Troy Tulowitzki Troy Trevor Tulowitzki earns honorable mention here with his glove (a two-time gold Glover) and bat (topping 20 home runs in seven of 12 MLB seasons). Still active, \u201cTulo\u201d may someday take Alan Trammell\u2019s spot in this lineup. Tulowitzki has played for the Rockies (2006-2015) and Blue Jays (2016-17). He missed the 2018 season (ankle surgery) and signed with the Yankees for 2019. Tulowitzki is a five-time All Star, whose best season was 2014, when he hit .340 with 30 home runs and 105 RBI for the Rockies. For his career, he is .290 (in 1,286 games), with 224 home runs and 779 RBI. His numbers would be even stronger if not for the injury bug. His past injuries include: a torn left quadriceps, fractured wrist, groin surgery, fractured rib, hip surgery, cracked shoulder blade. Troy Tulowitzki \u2026 Rare Feats Troy Tulowitzki is one of only two players to both hit for the cycle and turn an unassisted triple play (the other is John Valentin).\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nOutfield \u2013 Stan Musial\n\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with Stan \u201cThe Man\u201d Musial on your team. One of the greatest players in MLB history (inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1960), Musial played 22 MLB seasons (all for the Cardinals) between 1941 and 1963 (he missed 1945 to military service).\n\nMusial was an All Star in 20 of his 22 seasons and a three-time NL Most Valuable Player. He won seven batting titles and led the NL in hits six times, runs scored five times, RBI two times, doubles eight times and triples five times. He also topped the NL in total bases, on base percentage and slugging percentage six times each.\n\nStan Musial hit .347 in 1944 \u2013 missed the 1945 season due to military service \u2013 and came back to hit .365 in 1946.\n\nMusial hit over .300 in 17 full seasons and over .350 in five campaigns (a high of .376 in 1948). He topped 20 home runs ten times, with a high of 39 in 1948. He also hit 50 or more doubles twice, 20 triples twice, had 200 or more hits in six seasons, 100+ RBI in ten seasons and 100+ runs scored in 11. For his career, Musial had 3,630 hits (.331 average), 475 home runs and 1,951 RBI. and 1,949 runs scored. He is in MLB\u2019s top ten all time in games played, hits, runs scored, runs batted in, doubles and total bases.\n\nHow good was Stan Musial? He was good enough to take your breath away.

However, Simmons did not enjoy as notable a nickname as \u201cStan the Man.\u201d Due to his unusual batting style (front foot pointed toward third base), he became known as \u201cBucketfoot Al.\u201d (Note: It\u2019s reported Simmons went with Simmons over Szymanski because of the difficulty people had pronouncing Szymanski.)\n\nSimmons played 20 MLB seasons (1924-41, 1943-44) and ended just 73 hits shy of 3,000 \u2013 with a .334 career average and 307 home runs.

The Baseball Hall of Famer was an All Star in 18 seasons, a seven-time Gold Glover and the 1967 AL Most Valuable Player (when he won the batter\u2019s Triple Crown \u2013 Avg.-HR-RBI).\n\nYastrzemski was a three-time batting champ and topped .300 in six seasons. He had 100+ RBI in five campaigns, 100+ runs scored in three and 40 or more home runs in three. He led the AL in runs scored three times, doubles three times, hits twice and home runs and RBI once each. His best year was 1967, when he won the AL Triple Crown with a .326-44-121 stat line. Yaz finished his career with 3,419 hits (.285 average), 452 long balls and 1,944 RBI. He also hit .369-4-11 in 17 post-season contests. He is among MLB\u2019s top ten (career) in games played, at bats, hits, total bases, doubles and walks. In 1968 \u2013 known in baseball lore as \u201cThe Year of the Pitcher\u201d \u2013 Carl Yastrzemski won the American League batting title with a .301 average \u2013 the lowest ever for a league leaders.\n\nSide Note:\n\nI have my own memories of Yaz. With two games left in the 1967 season, my Twins went into Boston with a one-game lead over the Red Sox and lost two games (and the pennant) to Boston by scores of 6-4 and 5-3. All Yaz did was go 7-for-8 with a double, a home run, two runs scored and six RBI.

During that time, Niekro earned 318 wins (16th all time) versus 274 losses \u2013 and put up a 3.35 ERA. The 6\u20191\u201d/180-pound knuckleballer won 20 or more games three times and 15 or more in 13 seasons. His nickname was \u201cKnucksie,\u201d but I would have preferred \u201cKnuck-ski.\u201d\n\nNiekro led the National League in wins in 1974 (20) and 1979 (21) He was also the league leader once each in earned run average (1.87), winning percentage (17-4, .810 in 1982 \u2013 at age 43) and strikeouts (262 in 1977). Working with the tireless ease of a knuckleballer, he also led the NL four times each in games started, complete games and inning pitched. Niekro\u2019s best season was 1974, when he went 20-13, 2.38 \u2013 leading the NL in wins, complete games (18) and innings pitched 302 1/3.\n\nPhil Niekro Trivia \u2026 Phil Niekro is the last MLB pitcher to lead his league in both wins and losses in the same season \u2013 going 21-20, 3.39 in 1979. That season, he also led the league in starts (44), complete games (23) and innings pitched (342). Phil Niekro and his brother Joe Niekro hold the record for the most MLB wins by brothers, with 539. Phil went 318-274, while Joe went 221-204. In 1979, Phil and Joe Niekro tied to the NL lead in victories with 21 each. On May 29, 1976, Joe Niekro hit the only home run of his 22-season (1,165 plate appearances) MLB career. The opposing pitcher? His brother Phil. On August 5, 1973, Phil Niekro threw the first no hitter for the \u201cAtlanta\u201d Braves \u2013 defeating the San Diego Padres 9-0.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nLH Starting Pitcher \u2013 Ed Lopat (Lopatynski)\n\nEddie Lopat pitched in 12 MLB seasons \u2013 for the White Sox (1944-47), Yankees (1948-55) and Orioles (1955). He went 166-112, with a 3.21 earned run average. It\u2019s reported that Eddie used Lopat over Lopatynski because the latter did not fit into a box score. Lopat also picked up the nickname \u201cThe Junkman,\u201d because of his ability to both change speeds and deliver a wide range of breaking pitches.\n\nThe 5\u201910\u2019/180-pound southpaw was an All Star with the Yankees in 1933, when he went 21-9, 2.91 (his only 20-win season \u2013 although from 1947 through 1953, he won 15 or more games in six of seven seasons). In 1953, again with the Yankees, Lopat went 16-4 and led the American League in winning percentage (.800) and ERA (2.42).\n\nIn seven World Series starts, all with the Yankees, Lopat went 4-1, 2.60 with three complete games.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nRH Reliever \u2013 Jim Konstanty\n\nJim Konstanty has the distinction of being the first MLB relief pitcher to win a league MVP Award. He accomplished the feat in 1950, when he was called on in relief a league-leading 74 times by the Phillies. Konstanty won 16 games (seven losses) and led the league with 22 saves. That season, the Phillies won the NL pennant with a 91-63 record \u2013 which means Konstanty won or saved 42 percent of Philadelphia\u2019s wins.\n\nIn his eleven MLB seasons, the 6\u20191\u201d/202-pound righty went 66-48, 3.46 and saved 76 games (152 innings pitched in relief). By the way, James was Konstanty\u2019s middle name \u2013 his first name was Casimir.\n\nA Man for All Seasons \u2026 In his senior year in high school, Jim Konstanty was captain of the Arcade High School basketball, baseball and football teams. Then, at Syracuse University, he lettered in baseball, basketball, soccer and boxing.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nLH Reliever \u2013 Ron Perranoski\n\nRon Perranoski \u2013 a 6\u2019/180-pound southpaw \u2013 went 79-74, 2.79 with 178 saves in 13 MLB seasons. He played for the Dodgers (1961-67, 1972); Twins (1968-71); Tigers (1971-72); and Angels (1973).\n\nPerranoski led his league in games pitched in three seasons and games saved twice (with a high of 34 saves for the 1974 Twins). In 1963, he led the NL in winning percentage at .842 \u2013 picking up 16 wins (three losses) and 21 saves, all in relief. Add in his 1.67 earned run average and it is clearly his best season.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-A COUPLE OF SPECIAL MENTIONS \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMoe Drabowsky \u2013 Best Polish-Born Major Leaguer\n\nMiroslav Drabowsky was born in Ozano, Poland on July 21, 1935, to a Jewish (American citizen) mother and a Polish father. His family moved to the United Stars in the late 1930\u2019s, as Adolf Hitler was gaining momentum in Eastern Europe. Growing up in Connecticut, Drabowsky played high school baseball at Loomis Chaffee School and college baseball at Trinity College in Hartford. He signed with the Cubs in July of 1956 and made his MLB debut on August 7 of that year (at age 21).\n\nThe 6\u20193\u201d/190-pound righty was a starter his first four seasons, going 29-40, 3.81, with 22 complete games in 83 starts. Drabowsky switched to the bullpen in 1960 (seven starts in 32 appearances) and made a name for himself coming in from the pen. From 1960-72, he went 59-65, 3.66, with 54 saves (421 appearances in relief, 71 starts).\n\nIn 17 MLB seasons, Drabowsky went 88-105, 3.71 with 54 saves. He struck out 1,162 batters (702 walks) in 1,641 innings. Drabowsky pitched for the Cubs (1956-60); Braves (1961); Reds (1962); Athletics (1962-65); Orioles (1966-68, 1970); Royals (1969-70); Cardinals (1971-72); and White Sox (1972).\n\nMoe Drabowsky, a member of the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame (NPASHOF), gave up the 3,000th hit of Stan Musial (another NPASHOF inductee).\n\n____________________________________________\n\nArt \u201cPinky Deras \u2013 Best-Ever Little Leaguer\n\nArt \u201cPinky\u201d Deras was inducted into the National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame in 2011 \u2013 recognizing his exploits as a 12-year-old Little Leaguer \u2013 leading the Hamtramck, Michigan team to the 1958 Little League National Championship. Now, Deras was big for his age, six-feet tall and 135 pounds as a 12-year-old. He was also a dominant force \u2013 going 18-0 on the mound (16 shutouts and ten no-hitters) and whiffing 298 batters in 108 innings. That means 92 percent of his outs came via the strikeout. He also hit a resounding .641, with 33 home runs and 112 RBI.\n\nDeras signed a contract with the Cardinals right out of high school, declining of football scholarship to Michigan State. He played five minor league seasons, hitting .243, with 32 home runs in 518 games. He did not pitch in professionally ranks.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nPrimary resources: Baseball-Reference.com; Society for American Baseball Research; National Polish-American Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nBASEBALL ROUNDTABLE ON THE TOP 100 BASEBALL BLOG LIST\n\nBaseball Roundtable is on the Feedspot list of the Top 1oo Baseball Blogs.

However, hominins were eating meat at least 2.6 million years (Myr) ago, and were probably hunting large prey 1.9 Myr ago (Supplementary Note 1). Although contemporary hunter-gatherers rarely rely on throwing to kill prey, earlier hominins probably needed to throw projectiles frequently to acquire and defend carcasses before the relatively recent inventions of the atlatl and bow10. We can therefore surmise that the ability to throw well would confer a strong selective benefit to early hunters. However, to test when and how hominins evolved the ability to throw projectiles effectively, it is necessary to understand both throwing biomechanics and how changes in hominin anatomy affect throwing performance.\n\nThrows are powered by rapid, sequential activation of many muscles, starting in the legs and progressing through the hips, torso, shoulder, elbow and wrist11,12,13,14. Torques generated at each joint accelerate segmental masses, creating rapid angular movements that accumulate kinetic energy in the projectile until its release. It has been shown that internal (medial) rotation around the long axis of the humerus makes the largest contribution to projectile velocity15. This rotation, which occurs in a few milliseconds and can exceed 9,000\u00b0 per s (ref. 13), is the fastest motion that the human body produces. Although previous research has focused on the internal rotator muscles of the shoulder11,16,17, these muscles alone cannot explain how humans generate so much internal rotational power. Calculations of the maximum power-production capacity of all of the shoulder\u2019s internal rotator muscles indicate that these muscles can contribute, at most, half of the shoulder rotation power generated during the throwing motion (Supplementary Notes 2 and 3). Peak internal rotation torque also occurs well before the humerus starts to rotate internally12. Furthermore, variation in muscle fibre orientation in these muscles produce actions other than internal humeral rotation that reduce power output for this action.\n\nElastic energy storage has been shown to be an important source of power amplification for many high-powered movements18,19. We propose that several evolutionarily novel features in the human shoulder help to store and release elastic energy to generate much of the power needed for rapid humeral rotation during human throwing. According to this model, energy storage occurs during the arm-cocking phase (Fig. 1a), which begins with completion of a large step towards the target. As the foot hits the ground, the arm is already externally rotated, horizontally extended, and abducted nearly 90\u00b0 at the shoulder, with forearm flexion approaching 90\u00b0 at the elbow13. As the cocking phase begins, large torques are generated by rapid rotation of the torso towards the target and by the activation of the major shoulder horizontal flexor, pectoralis major11,16. The positioning of the shoulder and elbow at this time increases the mass moment of inertia around the long axis of the humerus, causing the forearm and hand to lag behind the accelerating torso. Furthermore, a flexed elbow during the cocking phase enables passive inertial forces to externally counter rotate the arm, stretching the short, parallel tendons, ligaments and elastic components of muscles that cross the shoulder, potentially storing elastic energy in the large aggregate cross-sectional area of these structures (Supplementary Note 4). When the biceps deactivate and elbow extension begins, the arm\u2019s moment of inertia is reduced, allowing these stretched elements to recoil, releasing energy and helping to power the extremely rapid internal rotation of the humerus (Supplementary Note 5).\n\nFigure 1: Model of elastic energy storage. a, Arm-cocking and acceleration phases of the overhand throw. Light grey text boxes show the relative timing of the \u2018cocking\u2019 motions; dark grey boxes indicate the relative occurrence of the opposing \u2018acceleration\u2019 motions. Short boxes illustrate variation in timing of onset and cessation. b, c, Humans (right) and chimpanzees (left) differ in arm abduction and elbow flexion during throwing (b; a free-body diagram shows the torso (cylinder), arm and forearm, with black dots representing segmental centres of mass and \u03c4 vectors showing input torques), because of differences in shoulder orientation, that alter the major line of action (white arrows) of the pectoralis major (human, right; chimpanzee, left) (c). In humans, aligning the long axis of the humerus with the major axis of the pectoralis major and flexing the elbow maximizes inertia to shoulder flexion torque and loads the elastic elements in the shoulder. However, in chimpanzee morphology there is conflict between maximizing humeral rotation or maximizing elbow extension, hence chimpanzees are unable to achieve the same elastic energy storage. d, Signatures of shoulder orientation found in the scapula (human, right; chimpanzee, left) can be used to reconstruct hominin shoulder orientation; for example, the vertebral\u2013glenoid angle is shown in red. PowerPoint slide Full size image\n\nThree derived morphological features of humans that are not present in chimpanzees, our closest extant relatives, have a major role in storing and releasing elastic energy during throwing (Supplementary Note 6). First, the tall, mobile waists of humans decouple the hips and thorax, permitting more torso rotation20, in turn enabling high torque production over a large range of motion (ROM), which is needed to load the shoulder\u2019s elastic elements. Second, humeral torsion, the angle between humeral head orientation and the axis of the elbow, is 10-20\u00b0 lower in human throwers\u2019 dominant arms compared to chimpanzee humeri5. Decreased torsion extends the rotational ROM at the shoulder externally21,22, potentially enabling more elastic energy storage during the cocking phase. Finally, humans have a more laterally oriented glenohumeral joint, which aligns the pectoralis major flexion moment around the same axis as the torso rotation moment. This orientation allows humans to increase the arm\u2019s moment of inertia by abducting the humerus in line with the torso rotation and shoulder flexion torques, maximizing resistance to both (Fig. 1b, c, d). In contrast, chimpanzees have a more cranially oriented glenohumeral joint and limited ability to produce torso rotation torque, and this requires them to maximize inertial loading by abducting their humeri more than humans to bring their arm in line with the pectoralis major flexion moment. However, this increased abduction would force chimpanzees to position their elbow in a more extended posture to maximize the arm\u2019s moment of inertia, resulting in a costly reduction in elbow extension during the throw.\n\nWe tested the effects of these derived features on throwing performance using high-speed, three-dimensional kinematic and kinetic data from 20 human throwers with considerable prior training to quantify power production at the shoulder during overhand baseball throwing (Supplementary Note 7). During the arm-cocking phase, the throwers\u2019 humeri externally rotate 57 \u00b1 15\u00b0 (mean \u00b1 s.d.) past the active ROM limit achieved using their own muscular power, indicating passive stretching of the ligaments, tendons and muscles crossing the shoulder. Inverse dynamics analysis shows that during this period, the shoulder produces an opposing internal rotation torque, causing a sustained period of power absorption (Fig. 2). During arm-cocking, the negative work of shoulder rotation averages \u2212201 \u00b1 70 J, with an average power of \u2212631 \u00b1 337 W. In contrast, the total rotational work of the subsequent internal rotation motion is 346 \u00b1 116 J, with power during acceleration averaging 3,847 \u00b1 1,697 W. If 90% of the negative work during arm-cocking is stored and returned elastically23, this energy can account for 54 \u00b1 15% of the internal humeral rotation work done during a typical throw.\n\nFigure 2: Shoulder rotation and elbow flexion\u2013extension power. Mean shoulder rotational power (solid blue line) with 95% confidence intervals (dotted blue lines) shows a sustained period (white) of negative power and work during arm-cocking (C), between stride (STR) and maximum external rotation (MER). This negative work is recovered (grey) during acceleration (A), between MER and release (REL). Recovered work powers both internal rotation at the shoulder and extension of the elbow. All power values are normalized by phase duration, with relative time and per cent arm-cocking duration shown on the x axis. Graphs on the right show the mean \u00b1 s.d. PowerPoint slide Full size image\n\nElastic energy storage at the shoulder also augments the generation of joint velocity and power at the elbow. During acceleration, the elbow extends at very high angular velocities (2,434 \u00b1 552\u00b0 per s) despite large amounts of negative power and work (\u2212246 \u00b1 63 J), indicating that the triceps alone are not powering this rapid extension (Fig. 2). As previous studies have shown, elbow extension is powered primarily by segments proximal to the elbow15,24, particularly the shoulder.\n\nAn additional line of evidence to support the idea that elastic energy storage is important comes from experimentally limiting shoulder rotational ROM with therapeutic braces (Supplementary Notes 8\u201311); restricting external rotation by 24 \u00b1 9\u00b0. During brace trials, shoulder rotation beyond the active ROM decreased by 50 \u00b1 36% and shoulder work during arm-cocking decreased by 39 \u00b1 16% (repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), P < 0.001) (Fig. 3). Shoulder rotation work during the subsequent acceleration phase was not significantly different between conditions, but average shoulder rotation power during acceleration decreased significantly (\u221216 \u00b1 35%, repeated measures ANOVA, P = 0.036). Wearing a shoulder brace also decreased elbow negative work during acceleration by 20 \u00b1 21% (repeated measures ANOVA, P < 0.001). Overall, these work and power reductions from less elastic energy exchange significantly reduced humeral rotation angular acceleration (\u221224 \u00b1 29%, repeated measures ANOVA, P < 0.001) and elbow extension angular velocity (\u221221 \u00b1 10%, repeated measures ANOVA, P < 0.001), reducing ball speed by 8 \u00b1 6% (multivariate ANOVA, P < 0.001).\n\nFigure 3: Shoulder-brace restriction condition. Brace restricted mean power (solid red line) with 95% confidence intervals (dotted red lines) for shoulder rotation and elbow flexion-extension. Values for the unrestricted condition (no brace) are shown by the solid blue line. In the right panels, work values are shown in red bar and red solid bar (restricted using a brace) or white bar and solid grey bar (unrestricted). Significant reductions (**P < 0.05) in shoulder-rotation work occur during arm-cocking (C) and during elbow flexion\u2013extension work when accelerating (A). Graphs on the right show the mean \u00b1 s.d. PowerPoint slide Full size image\n\nNatural variation in humeral torsion (Supplementary Note 12) produces similar performance effects. It has been known for a long time that athletes such as pitchers have lower degrees of humeral torsion, by 10\u201315\u00b0, in their throwing versus non-throwing arms21,22,25. By maintaining relatively lower, juvenile levels of torsion into adulthood26, throwing athletes increase power generation by shifting the rotational ROM of the humerus externally21,22. This shift enables further external rotation during arm-cocking and increases internal rotation during acceleration (Fig. 4a), permitting more elastic energy storage and release (Fig. 4b, c). It is unknown whether the plasticity of humeral torsion is greater in humans than in other taxa, but we speculate that plasticity in humans may be advantageous, enabling low torsion to persist in the throwing arm, whereas higher torsion (useful for manipulative tasks) develops in the non-throwing arm5,25.\n\nFigure 4: Humeral torsion and throwing performance. a\u2013c Low humeral torsion shifts the shoulder rotational ROM externally (a), enabling increased negative work during arm-cocking to be stored as elastic energy (b), and resulting in faster projectile speed (c). d, Humans and chimpanzees show comparable degrees of torsion5, although throwing athletes show reduced dominant-arm torsion25 consistent with low torsion in Australopithecus and Homo erectus5. Chimpanzees are a combined sample as they do not show arm dominance, whereas human values are split between dominant and non-dominant arms as they show arm dominance. In d, the black and grey boxes and whiskers show torsion-angle quartiles, and the red dot shows the torsion-angle mean. PowerPoint slide Full size image\n\nIt is difficult to establish when high-speed throwing first evolved because the first projectiles were probably rocks and untipped wooden spears (Supplementary Notes 7 and 13). However, many of the derived morphological features that help human throwers to store elastic energy can be assessed in the fossil record (Supplementary Note 14). These features evolved in a mosaic fashion, some pre-dating the evolution of Homo. Tall, decoupled waists first appear in Australopithecus as adaptations for locomotion20. Low humeral torsion also appears in Australopithecus, probably resulting from the release of the forelimbs from weight-bearing during quadrupedal locomotion, and is present in early Homo5 (Fig. 4d). Although variation in glenoid orientation exists within Australopithecus27, a fully lateral glenoid position is first definitively present in Homo erectus28 (Supplementary Notes 15 and 16). Such laterally oriented shoulders probably decreased the mechanical advantage of the scapular rotator muscles during climbing, and probably had little or no effect on stone-tool production. Throwing performance may also have benefited from low, wide shoulders, long legs, and hyperextendable wrists, which are all present in H. erectus20,29. Although some of these features were probably selected for functions other than throwing, their combined configuration, first present in H. erectus, would have benefited throwing performance by enabling elastic energy storage in the shoulder, providing a selective advantage during hunting (Supplementary Note 1). Furthermore, high-speed throwing was probably a critical component of a suite of hunting behaviours that enabled early members of the genus Homo to thrive in new and varied habitats both in and out of Africa.\n\nToday, technological advances such as the bow and arrow, nets and firearms have reduced contemporary hunter-gatherers\u2019 reliance on thrown projectiles, but the human ability and proclivity to throw persists in many sports, in which athletes rely on the same mechanics (Supplementary Note 7). In this modern context, the evolution of adaptations for elastic energy storage during human throwing has implications for the high prevalence of injuries in throwing athletes. Paleolithic hunters almost certainly threw less frequently than modern athletes, who often deliver more than 100 high-speed throws over the course of a few hours. Unfortunately, the ligaments and tendons in the human shoulder and elbow are not well adapted to withstanding such repeated stretching from the high torques generated by throwing, and frequently suffer from laxity and tearing12,30. Although humans\u2019 unique ability to power high-speed throws using elastic energy may have been critical in enabling early hunting, repeated overuse of this motion can result in serious injuries in modern throwers."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-07-03-sp-750-story.html", "page_content": "NEWSDAY\n\nThe year was 1927.

He threw hard, he threw accurate. All his throws were so good. He hit 60 home runs and made 600 great throws. But our left fielder, Bob Meusel, had the best arm in baseball. He played the sun field in Yankee Stadium. Him and Babe went at it that whole year.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRuth, Koenig said, had to settle for second best to Meusel. \u201cBut,\u201d Koenig said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want Babe to know I said that.\u201d\n\nSept. 29, 1954. One of the best throws in history was obscured by one of the most memorable catches. In the deepest recesses of the Polo Grounds, Willie Mays made his back-to-the plate grab of Vic Wertz\u2019 long drive to center in Game 1 of the World Series against the Cleveland Indians. It forever became known as The Catch. Far less was made of what should be remembered as The Throw, which held base-runners Larry Doby on second and Al Rosen on first.\n\n\u201cYou know where he caught the ball,\u201d Doby said, \u201cnearly 500 feet away. From the position he threw the ball and the accuracy, it was a great throw.\u201d Despite written accounts to the contrary, Doby insists he did not tag up.\n\nMays\u2019 throw, not the catch, was canonized by author Arnold Hano in his book \u201cA Day in the Bleachers.\u201d Hano wrote: \u201cWhat an astonishing throw, to make all other throws ever before it appear as flings of teen-age girls. This was the throw of a giant, the throw of a howitzer made human ... \u201c In the ensuing years, Mays would talk more of the throw than the catch.\n\nBaseball writer Dan Daniel, who started covering the sport in 1909, wrote that Mays had the greatest arm he ever saw. \u201cIn 1966, center fielder Mays nearly threw for the cycle, throwing runners out at home, third and first and missing at second only because Tito Fuentes missed the tag on the incoming runner.\u201d\n\nAug. 27, 1951. Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca allowed what should have been his first hit of the game -- a one-hop liner to right by Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Mel Queen. But right fielder Carl Furillo charged the ball and gunned it to first in time to nail Queen. The no-hitter lasted until the ninth when Branca gave up two hits. In the next morning\u2019s newspaper, Dick Young wrote, \u201cThe two fine Italian arms of Branca and Furillo had a no-hitter running for eight innings.\u201d\n\nBaseball often overlooks one of the game\u2019s most integral weapons: the armed robbers of the outfield. They can be embodied in players such as Ruth, Mays, Furillo, Roberto Clemente and even lesser-known riflemen such as Ellis Valentine, Mike Hershberger and part-time player Bob Kennedy, whom Rosen recalled having an even stronger arm than Mays.\n\nFew in baseball have had the ability to throw the ball with such power and accuracy that it compares to the excitement of a tape-measure homer.\n\nMost tributes to mighty arms would list Clemente, the late Hall of Famer for the Pirates, as the top thrower. \u201cClemente was bigger than life as far as his arm was concerned,\u201d said broadcaster Tim McCarver, who played against Clemente for more than a decade. \u201cWhat made it unique with Roberto was his whirl and throw. He would actually field the ball off the carom in that short, but very difficult Forbes Field wall, catch it, pivot on the back foot and turn and throw almost blindly at times.\u201d\n\nRusty Staub, a contemporary of Clemente and also a right fielder, said Clemente was simply the best. \u201cHe made the greatest throws I ever saw in my life,\u201d Staub said. \u201cHe would go into that bullpen (along the right-field line in Forbes Field) where you couldn\u2019t see home plate. One time, he went for a ball that spun into the bullpen. A guy was tagging up from third base with one out. He knew he had it made, he didn\u2019t run hard. All of a sudden this rocket came from nowhere. It was like a strike, right across the plate. He (Clemente) couldn\u2019t even see home plate!\u201d\n\nOakland A\u2019s Coach Gene Clines, who played with Clemente, added, \u201cNo runner, no matter who he was, could ever advance an extra base on a ball hit to right.\u201d\n\nIf a great throwing arm was the only criteria, Rocky Colavito would have made it to the Hall of Fame. If he did not have the best arm in all of baseball, it certainly was the most thrilling. Colavito honed his throwing skill in the Bronx.\n\n\u201cAs a kid I used to throw rocks and stones,\u201d Colavito, the former Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers outfielder, said from his home near Reading, Pa. \u201cI used to throw them as far as I could. There was a little park that we used to play in across the street from P.S. 4 called Crotona Park, with a little playground area. There was a fence around the area and you had to hit the ball over the second fence for a home run.\u201d\n\nColavito\u2019s brothers made little Rocky throw the ball over that fence. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go home at night until I threw the ball over that second fence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever I needed a little extra money, my friends would bet me. You know where the Third Avenue el is? I\u2019d go halfway up the block, maybe three quarters up the block and I would throw the ball over the elevator and it would come down on the other side. It was like taking candy from a baby it was so funny. I never lost one bet in my life.\u201d\n\nLater, in the majors, teammates would bet Colavito he could not throw the ball over the roofs of stadiums. It was more pocket change for him. \u201cFrom home plate it would have been nothing to throw it up on the roof in Yankee Stadium,\u201d Colavito said. Once, in a publicity stunt for a Triple-A team in San Diego that was run by Ralph Kiner, Colavito said he threw a ball 440 feet. Kiner confirmed it and added the other participants in the throwing contest were using jai-alai cestas.\n\nColavito was sometimes known as a loose cannon for his wild throws and he proved it one day in the late 1950s in a comical incident involving Mickey Mantle. \u201cIt was a Sunday doubleheader in Cleveland,\u201d Colavito said. \u201cMickey\u2019s on third base, and they hit a ball to medium right field to me. I would get back on a ball like that, and then I\u2019d come in and take it on the run and I really put everything I had behind it. I caught the ball on the run and Mickey faked me. I see him tagging up, and I wasn\u2019t taking any chances. The way he ran you couldn\u2019t afford to. So I reach back and let it go as hard as I could. It was like a line drive, but it was a little too high. It took off. (Catcher) Russ Nixon jumped for the ball, but it just carried right over his glove. Mickey saw that and ran home.\n\n\u201cThe ball hit the brick wall -- they didn\u2019t have cushions around the walls in those days -- and bounced -- can you believe this -- right back to Russ at home plate. Mickey was out at home. Mickey was so embarrassed, but it wasn\u2019t his fault. I had to laugh.\u201d\n\nDave Winfield, the former Yankee now with the California Angels, said he made his arm a defensive weapon. He refers to the foul line as a \u201cgun sight\u201d for setting up throws. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like being a gun-slinger,\u201d he said about throwing. \u201cYou get yourself a little reputation and you want to keep it up.\u201d\n\nThe \u201890s will see a farewell to the great arms of Winfield, the Boston Red Sox\u2019s Dwight Evans and Andre Dawson of the Cubs. Among the few others who stand out are Snyder, Jesse Barfield of the Yankees, rookie Dante Bichette of the Angels and the Seattle Mariners\u2019 Ken Griffey Jr. According to Dawson, none has a better arm than Cubs shortstop Shawon Dunston, who does not like the outfield. \u201cI don\u2019t know how far I could throw a ball,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to find out. The outfield is boring.\u201d\n\nSnyder, Cleveland\u2019s right fielder, is generally regarded as the best, but Bichette may be the brashest. \u201cCory Snyder has a pretty strong arm, but I haven\u2019t seen anybody that can throw harder or more accurately than myself,\u201d Bichette said. \u201cI\u2019ve never measured how far I can throw a baseball. I remember one time they challenged me to throw it out of Anaheim Stadium, and I\u2019ve done that a few times. I played a lot of shortstop when I was younger and I can throw off-balance. I don\u2019t have to set my feet, my feet are quick. The runners are starting to respect me a little bit more.\u201d\n\nSnyder started his career as an infielder, and was not sure if the switch to the outfield would be to his liking. \u201cFor a little while I was feeling very different because I was used to fielding more balls and getting more action,\u201d Snyder said. \u201cYou have to adapt. I think the most important thing is first-step quickness. Being able to read the pitcher, maybe look in and see where the catcher\u2019s moving to see where the ball\u2019s going. I am able to pick up the ball pretty quick, get that jump. I take a lot of pride in my throwing. Sometimes I can throw behind runners because I know I have a chance. I go through a series of questions before the ball\u2019s ever hit to me. Two or three steps to my left or my right, or if it\u2019s right at me, whatever it is, I know where I am going with it.\u201d\n\nNot too many runners dare to test Snyder\u2019s arm. \u201cThey respect me and still want to take a shot at me, but they haven\u2019t been running on me as much this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI only have a few assists. Everybody kind of goes to second base or third base and stops, which is the ultimate respect. I do look for a challenge with a Rickey Henderson, for example.\u201d\n\nThe Athletics\u2019 Henderson, said he has not encountered the arm that could consistently hold him back. \u201cNobody\u2019s tough for me. Snyder\u2019s got a great arm and Barfield, too. That rookie (Bichette) they got now might have the best arm in the game. I ran on all of them many times. I\u2019ve been thrown out twice going from second to home -- Barfield did throw me out one time and Jose Canseco one time, both in Yankee Stadium.\u201d\n\nWhile many of the great outfield arms have gone unrecognized, there is at least one that has not. Colavito\u2019s baseball legacy is his great gun. In a 14-year career, he hit 374 home runs and drove in 1,159 runs but few recall that, not even Colavito himself.\n\n\u201cIn batting practice they stopped everything to watch Ted Williams hit,\u201d Colavito said. \u201cThey stopped to watch me throw. Today, when I meet somebody, they remember the arm.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://thesporting.blog/blog/hardest-hitters-boxing-history", "page_content": "This has been proven throughout boxing\u2019s history. Many boxers have built great legacies simply by being the hardest punchers, Deontay Wilder anyone?\n\nBut who exactly is the hardest-punching boxer of all time? In this article, we\u2019ll cover the 5 biggest hitters of all time.\n\nWhat Makes Someone A Hard Puncher In Boxing?\n\nBoxing is a sport in which you\u2019re supposed to punch your opponent as hard as you can. This is to inflict enough blunt force trauma so they cannot continue the fight.\n\nHowever, there are some boxers who hit their opponents with a freakishly high amount of power.\n\nThese boxers are usually able to finish off their opponents with just one punch and they have a high knockout rate as a result.\n\nIn this list, we\u2019ll look at the top boxers who punch extraordinarily hard. And yes, everyone\u2019s a heavyweight here so don\u2019t be surprised!\n\nThe 5 Hardest Hitters of All Time\n\n1. Mike Tyson\n\nHe had a devastating overhand right and a quick, powerful left hook.\n\nTyson was a relentless attacker who often overwhelmed his opponents with a barrage of punches. He was known for his \"peek-a-boo\" style, where he would tuck his chin behind his gloves and charge forward, throwing punches in rapid succession.\n\nDespite his aggressive style, Tyson was also very accurate with his punches\n\nWhenever there\u2019s a discussion about the hardest-hitting boxer, Mike Tyson is always mentioned. Known as the baddest man on the planet, Tyson was feared for his punching power.\n\nAn example of the media hype around Iron Mikes punching power was when Tyson delivered a scripted punch to Shawn Michaels at WM 14."}]}
