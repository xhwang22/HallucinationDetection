Preparing the first inventory of the United State's natural resources, the commission was divided into four parts: water, forests, lands, and minerals.\n\nIn 1925, at the age of 17 years old, Benjamin was alive when on November 28th, radio station WSM broadcast the Grand Ole Opry for the first time. Originally airing as \u201cThe WSM Barn Dance\u201d, the Opry (a local term for \"opera\") was dedicated to honoring country music and in its history has featured the biggest stars and acts in country music.\n\nIn 1935, when he was 27 years old, the BOI's name (the Bureau of Investigation) was changed to the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) and it officially became a separate agency with the Department of Justice. J. Edgar Hoover, the Chief of the BOI, continued in his office and became the first Director of the FBI. The FBI's responsibility is to \"detect and prosecute crimes against the United States\".\n\nIn 1956, Benjamin was 48 years old when this was the year that the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, became an international sensation. He began the year as a regional favorite and ended the year with 17 recordings having been on the Billboard\u2019s Top 100 singles chart, 11 TV appearances, and a movie. Elvis scandalized adults and thrilled teens.\n\nIn 1981, in the year of Benjamin Flanagan's passing, on August 1st, MTV debuted. It was the first music video TV channel. The first music video played was the Buggles' \"Video Killed the Radio Star\" - the second was Pat Benatar's \"You Better Run\"."}, {"url": "https://www.ccri.edu/hof/members/flanagan.html", "page_content": "1994 Hall of Fame inductee - Dr. William F.

During that time, Dr. Flanagan was honored to deliver thousands of babies into the world and enjoyed watching them grow up in the community over the years. When Dr. Flanagan retired, he and Mary traveled, and his love of the sea continued beyond his service in the Navy. One of his favorite places to be was on the beach with Mary. He will be deeply missed by family and friends who knew and loved him, although they take comfort knowing he is at home with the Lord.\n\nDr. Flanagan is survived by his loving wife, Mary; his children, Bill and his wife Julie Flanagan; Patti and her husband Jeff Kennedy; and David Flanagan; his grandchildren Brandon Flanagan, Skyler Kennedy, Ryan Flanagan, Jenna Flanagan, and Reagan Flanagan; his sister Alice and her husband Bruce Schick and their children; and his two sister-in-laws Sandra Cunningham and Judy Volner.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, Dr. Flanagan requested that donations be made to Love My Dog, a nonprofit organization that trains service dogs at no cost to the recipients. He learned about the owner, Clint Lothrop, and his organization when their beloved dog, Kokomo, received training. Donations can also be mailed to Love My Dog at 429 Whispering Pines Road, Auburn, AL. 36832."}, {"url": "https://obituaries.seattletimes.com/obituary/william-bill-flanagan-1083016720", "page_content": "Plant a tree: How does it work\n\nWhen your purchase is complete, a post will be made on the tribute wall of the deceased signifying the planting of a memorial tree.\n\nAn official certificate recognizing your purchase will be included with your email receipt.
