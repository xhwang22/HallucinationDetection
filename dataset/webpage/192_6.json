{"Alan Dinehart transitioned to sound films in the early 1930s.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/art/history-of-the-motion-picture/Postsynchronization", "page_content": "The technological development that most liberated the sound film, however, was the practice known variously as postsynchronization, rerecording, or dubbing, in which image and sound are printed on separate pieces of film so that they can be manipulated independently. Postsynchronization enabled filmmakers to edit images freely again. Because the overwhelming emphasis of the period from 1928 to 1931 had been on obtaining high-quality sound in production, however, the idea that the sound track could be modified after it was recorded took a while to catch on. Many motion-picture artists and technicians felt that sound should be reproduced in films exactly as it had originally been produced on the set; they believed that anything less than an absolute pairing of sound and image would confuse audiences.\n\nFor several years, both practice and ideology dictated that sound and image be recorded simultaneously, so that everything heard on the sound track would be seen on the screen and vice versa. A vocal minority of film artists nevertheless viewed this practice of synchronous, \u201cnaturalistic\u201d sound recording as a threat to the cinema. In their 1928 manifesto \u201cSound and Image,\u201d the Soviet directors Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Grigory Aleksandrov denounced synchronous sound in favour of asynchronous, contrapuntal sound\u2014sound that would counterpoint the images it accompanied to become another dynamic element in the montage process. Like the practical editing problem, the theoretical debate over the appropriate use of sound was eventually resolved by the practice of postsynchronization.\n\nPostsynchronization seems to have first been used by the American director King Vidor for a sequence in which the hero is chased through Arkansas swamplands in the all-Black musical Hallelujah (1929). Vidor shot the action on location without sound, using a freely moving camera. Later, in the studio, he added to the film a separately recorded sound track containing both naturalistic and impressionistic effects. In the following year Lewis Milestone\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front and G.W. Pabst\u2019s Westfront 1918 both used postsynchronization for their battle scenes. Ernst Lubitsch used dubbing in his first American sound films, the dynamic musicals The Love Parade (1929) and Monte Carlo (1930), as did the French director Ren\u00e9 Clair in Sous les toits de Paris (Under the Roofs of Paris, 1930). In all these early instances, sound was recorded and rerecorded on a single track, although some American directors, including Milestone and the Russian-born Armenian Rouben Mamoulian (Applause, 1929; City Streets, 1931), had experimented with multiple microphone setups and overlapping dialogue as early as 1929. Generally, through 1932, either dialogue or music dominated the sound track unless they had been simultaneously recorded on the set. In 1933, however, technology was introduced that allowed filmmakers to mix separately recorded tracks for background music, sound effects, and synchronized dialogue at the dubbing stage. By the late 1930s, postsynchronization and multiple-channel mixing had become standard industry procedure."}, {"url": "https://blog.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/brief-history-of-sound-in-film/", "page_content": "How did we get from the era of silent films to the stereo surround sound of today\u2019s cinemas? Ewan Grainger takes a whistle-stop tour of the history of sound in film.\n\nMany of us are familiar with the sight of pianists and even entire orchestras at film screenings of the \u2018silent era\u2019 (1894\u20131927) that look so alien when compared to cinema technology today. But how did sound in cinema evolve from the sometimes-peculiar era of silent films to what we know today? In this post we will take you on a whistle-stop tour of the story of sound in film.\n\nMuybridge and Edison\n\nWhen attending a lecture utilising Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s Zoopraxiscope, Thomas Edison began pondering the idea of sound and film. You may be familiar with this Zoopraxiscope, a method of projection which allowed Muybridge and others to study complex and difficult to observe actions, like a horse running, fencing, dancing, or boxing.\n\nMuybridge\u2019s experiments in moving images inspired Edison to consider marrying moving images with his existing phonogram sound technology. This technology, with its limited amplification of sound, provided more immersive audio experiences for a single viewer. But this was far from synchronisation as we know today.\n\nBy 1894, Edison\u2014inspired by Muybridge\u2019s early successes\u2014had placed much faith in his Kinetoscope. This was a personal viewing device that used a series of pulleys and gears to pull longer strips of film before a viewing port. And, while you won\u2019t likely see this on MTV, below is the only surviving footage of possibly the first-ever music video utilising a phonograph mechanism, allowing for the playback of sound in time with moving images.\n\n\ufeff\n\nThe Vitaphone\n\nLater patents, such as the Vitaphone used by Warner Bros., would enter into people\u2019s lives in the 1920s. The Vitaphone system was produced alongside Bell Telephone Company and Western Electric to gain a monopoly over film and sound technology in America. Expensive equipping costs for both industry and cinemas saw an initial rejection of this next great leap. But when sound burst into cinemas with the likes of Don Juan in 1926 and The Jazz Singer in 1927, it became clear the technology was here to stay.\n\nHowever, even these bombshell productions were at times hemmed in by still having sound recorded onto a shellac disc that could only store five minutes at a time. This stifled the creative freedom of film-makers significantly; even technologically groundbreaking films like The Jazz Singer still contained many silent speech intertitles.\n\nSound on film\n\nEventually, derivatives from outside Edison\u2019s grasp and inspired by the shortcomings of the Vitaphone system emerged. This came in many forms such as the Fox-owned Movietone (1927) and RCA\u2019s Photophone (1927).\n\nAfter much corporate espionage, personal competition, and sabotage to rival the greatest spy novels, the two systems were agreed upon as a standard for all the major American film studios. Europe would standardise on Tobis-Klangfilm and Tri-Ergon systems. This finally saw the leap to sound synchronisation on the physical film reels itself, as seen in the rare example of preserved Photophone film strips shown above.\n\nThis technology allowed for fluidity in film once again. From here, more complex and epic films emerged, such as King Kong in 1933.\n\nThe 1940s\u201350s: The television threat and multi-track sound\n\nEarly combinations of sound and projection technology existed in the 1930s, and by the 1940s, the issue of capturing sound synchronised footage onto film had been widely solved. By the late 1940s, this technology was widespread to the point that production could exist around the country. An example is the Gaumont-Kalee GK21 35mm cinema projector pictured to the right: manufactured by the Leeds-based company A Kershaw and Sons Ltd, it is now on display in Pictureville Bar at the National Science and Media Museum.\n\nIn the same period, however, the threat of TV emerged, and audiences needed to be stunned into going to the cinema. In terms of sound technology, this meant surround sound would again throw standardisation into disarray as the widening of screen aspect ratios called for more epic audio. One of the most popular processes, Cinerama, utilised a complex system of seven audio channels.\n\nAs screen sizes increased, so too did the need for deeper soundscapes. However, with this came a strange throwback to the earliest cinemas, in which a small army of personnel was needed in the theatre itself. Projectionists, sound controllers and engineers of all calibres were needed to bring widescreen and surround sound to life.\n\nSo, audiences were treated to epics like The Wizard of Oz as early as 1939 and the first Star Wars film as late as 1977. However, in this period of expanding auditory spectacle, those behind the scenes scrambled for standardisation amid a spiralling technological web. This is where Ray Dolby enters the story.\n\nDolby and the future\n\nIn 1938, the \u2018Academy curve\u2019 offered a crude solution to the question of how to standardise sound technology in cinemas. This is a method of chopping off the highs and lows of soundwave frequencies so that almost any cinema could project sound alongside film consistently. For many countries still struggling to bring film to rural areas, this technology was a miracle, allowing audio immersion only dreamt of before. But Ray Dolby knew better was possible.\n\nIn 1966, the noise reduction system Dolby A became standard in the recording industry. It eliminated the hissing sound that came with earlier standardisation efforts. This was achieved by having four channels all pressed onto the film strips themselves, which not only allowed more flexibility in the editing suite but also meant fewer people were needed on site to operate the technology.\n\nFrom here, Dolby improved on the system to bring about Dolby Stereo, a revolutionary surround system of compression that allowed cinema designers to consider the acoustics of any given theatre. When Star Wars premiered in 1977, audiences in local village cinemas could enjoy a comparable audio experience to that of their big city counterparts.\n\nBut what next? Will the pandemic push personal viewing and virtual reality sales, further forcing audio engineers to create more intricate technology to meet demands? Will this spell out a decline in shared viewing, making audio on a grand scale a smaller part of our lives?\n\nNothing is certain, but what can be said is that artificial intelligence and remastered audio seem to have combined with a keen interest in nostalgia to bring about new editing possibilities in audio from home.

A few are better known than the star I've chosen to focus on today, though none were nearly as active during such a short span as my pick, Alan Dinehart, was in 1930s and early '40s Hollywood.\n\nMore following the image of Alan Dinehart, born 1889-ish.\n\nIf you put a star by one of my top picks for October, Dante's Inferno (1935), and caught it on TCM earlier this week then you saw Alan Dinehart as Spencer Tracy's right hand man Jonesy. Another recent sighting was in The Whistler (1944) a few weeks back. Dinehart was seen offering advice to J. Carrol Naish in that first film of the Columbia series starring Richard Dix.\n\nAlan Dinehart was very active on Broadway from 1918 onwards and originally arrived in Hollywood as a leading man in 1931. But Dinehart was better suited for character roles and that is how we best remember him today. Dinehart typically played villains, or at the very least his characters were not completely on the level. I like him best for his brash businessmen, though I'd never want to sign a contract with one of his characters!\n\nAlan Dinehart was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, October 3, 1889. Maybe. No doubt about St. Paul, but every time new paperwork was filled out the rest gets called into question. His given first name was definitely Harold with the middle name of either Alan or Allen. In 1936 Alan Dinehart legally changed his name to that of his father, Mason Alan Dinehart, so that his youngest son could legally be known as Alan Dinehart III. I'd imagine that move didn't sit too well with his son by a previous marriage, Alan Dinehart, Jr.\n\nWhile the date on our Alan Dinehart's birth registration is given as October 5, later paper work, including his World War II draft registration card , give the date as October 3. The year Dinehart was born seems generally accepted as 1889, but it should be noted that on both his birth and draft registrations it is given as 1888, and in Dinehart's own hand on the latter. Dinehart's 1944 obituaries claimed he was 48, but Alan seemed flexible about his date of birth, even claiming he was just 40 on the 1930 census ... and he remained 40 on the 1940 census\n\nSome time after his birth Alan's father disappears (dies?) and the young man moved to Montana with his mother, Elizabeth, and stepfather, Louis Brasch. There he attended Butte High School where he had his first taste of acting.\n\nIn 1907 he married a Joe Trickey in Miles City, Montana, though I do not know what happened to this first Mrs. Dinehart. One way or another Alan left her behind when he took the cattle train to New York and embarked upon his acting career. He's said to have appeared in Applesauce in Chicago in 1910 and made his way to Broadway by 1918. In between he married a second time, to actress Marie Louise Dyer, with whom he'd have son Alan Dinehart, Jr. in 1918. It wasn't until after arriving in Hollywood that Dinehart would marry the woman he'd spend the rest of his life with, actress Mozelle Britton, in 1933.\n\nAlong with Alan's name change in 1936 came son Mason Alan Dinehart III, who would claim Irving S. Cobb as his godfather. In early 1939 Mozelle was involved in a terrible car accident, but she recovered and even played alongside Alan in a radio drama shortly before his death. Alan died in 1944; Mozelle in 1953. She was just 41. I'll leave it to you to decide how old Alan Dinehart was, I'll go with the flow and say 54.\n\nOne of Alan Dinehart's greatest triumphs came later in his career, off the screen and on the Broadway stage. His play Separate Rooms, which he wrote, directed and starred in along with Lyle Talbot and Glenda Farrell, was a Broadway hit playing over 600 times during 1940-41. That was after overcoming the lousy reviews which greeted it, no small feat.\n\nOther films you may have seen Alan Dinehart in include Lawyer Man (1932), where he's William Powell's uptown partner; as Cagney's competition in Jimmy the Gent (1934); and as Virginia Bruce's press agent in Born to Dance (1936) starring Eleanor Powell and James Stewart.\n\nYou've surely seen him in a number of other films as well: According to the IMDb, Alan Dinehart managed a total of 89 credited roles during his active Hollywood career from 1931 until his 1944 death. Mid-1930's newspaper reports noted that he typically worked in 15 films per year.\n\nBesides Lawyer Man, other movies featuring Alan Dinehart that I have previously written about on this site as The Payoff (1935) and The World Changes (1933).\n\nAlso\n\n... born on October 3 ... they're each better remembered for other projects, but I have to point to my Werewolf of London (1935) article in mentioning that co-stars Henry Hull and Warner Oland each celebrated their birthday on October 3.\n\nOland, best known for his portrayals of Charlie Chan, was the elder, born iN Sweden, 1879. While Hull, best recalled for Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat (1944), was Kentucky born in 1890.\n\nAlso born on October 3 were legend of the stage Eleanora Duse in 1858; character actor Charles Middleton in 1874; author of so many great stories turned into Depression era films, Damon Runyon, in 1880; director Leo McCarey, of so many favorite comedies, in 1896; and silent starlet Josephine Hill in 1899.\n\nTCM Pick\n\nYou can chop up today's TCM programming into four parts and all of them have something to recommend about them!\n\nThe day begins with five films starring character man James Gleason including the first Hildegarde Withers mystery, Penguin Pool Murder (1932) starring Edna May Oliver at 7:45 am. Next are three films directed by Leo McCarey, mentioned in the birthday section immediately above, beginning with Love Affair (1939) at 2 pm EST.\n\nThe first of TCM's Classic Horror marathons begins at 8 with The Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), the first of four chillers featuring Lionel Atwill. That's followed by Doctor X (1932) at 9:30; Mark of the Vampire (1935) at 11:00 pm; and House of Dracula (1945) at 12:15 am.\n\nThe overnight is populated by zombies with George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead (1968) airing at 2:45 am and the Val Lewton produced I Walked With a Zombie (1943) from Jacques Tourneur following at 4:30 am.\n\nTo pick just one? Well, if you've never seen any of these I'd feel you out some before insisting upon Night of the Living Dead, but since that one falls outside of the general timeline of this website I'd instead suggest Mark of the Vampire (1935), which besides Atwill also features Lionel Barrymore and Bela Lugosi.\n\nSales Notes\n\nI must really love the 1940 A and M Wix Cinema Cavalcade tobacco card sets because I'm constantly using examples from either the first or second volume to illustrate my posts!\n\nI've recently listed some higher grade examples, averaging about EX-MT or 7/10, to eBay in the Fixed Price/Buy it Now format. There are three different sized cards in these sets and so far I've listed all of the large and medium cards that I have on hand. The small ones are scanned and ready to be listed any day now.\n\nYou can find all of my Cinema Cavalcade cards on eBay HERE , including several from the tougher Volume 2 set that I listed soon before these Volume 1 beauties. (High grade only, EX-MT or better, HERE )\n\nAs an example we'll go with a favorite pose, that's also currently in stock, picturing Fredric March, Miriam Hopkins and Gary Cooper in Design for Living (1933), which I recently discovered will be airing on TCM this coming December 13 (right after Trouble in Paradise, fellow Hopkins and/or Lubitsch fans!).

Then when you least expect it, the advancement of technology changes how your job works. Some can adapt to the changes very well while others can\u2019t bring themselves to do so. These conflicting emotions took place when the film industry transitioned from silent films to sound films a.k.a \u201ctalkies.\u201d In honor of National Silent Movie Day, here is a media education lesson for you on how the transition from silent to sound films changed the acting industry forever.\n\nWhen you think about it, silent film collections were never 100% silent. Musical accompaniment allowed audiences to feel the emotions running through the characters and situations. At the time, the only way to bring recorded sound to an index of movies was through cylinders or discs of recordings. However, these devices could only hold four minutes of sound, were hard to amplify for the entire audience, and struggled to sync with the action on screen.\n\nAfter a ton of experimental attempts, 1927\u2019s The Jazz Singer changed everything by having a movie recorded in a Vitaphone\u2014a sound-on disc that involves the process of recording all of the audio on a phonograph record and then syncing it in real-time with the projector. Actors actually heard Al Jolson speak lines for the first time that were spontaneous and natural considering they were ad-libbed. Then in 1928, the first \u201c100%\u201d talkie came about with Lights of New York, and sound films were born.\n\nWith sound being incorporated into films, this changed the Hollywood definition of performance. According to Backstage, there were a lot of actors who succeeded in \u201ctalkies.\u201d Swedish actress Greta Garbo was one of the biggest box office performers of the silent era. Then when sound came to film, her thick Swedish accent did not turn audiences or filmmakers away as her low, husky voice fit in with the mysterious characters she played. Her first sound film Anna Christie was actually marketed as \u201cGarbo speaks!\u201d being the biggest box office hit of 1930 and earned her an Oscar nomination.\n\nAnother star that transitioned to sound that you can add to your movie library was John Barrymore whose stage talents in comedy and Shakespeare helped him fit in very well with sound films. His thundering stage-trained voice had him star in huge hits like Grand Hotel. Carole Lombard started in silent slapstick comedies of the 1920s with her energetic performances being brought onto classics like My Man Godfrey. This film earned her an Oscar nomination and \u201ctalkies\u201d helped critics put her on their top comedian's list.\n\nBoris Karloff would be typecast as Indian or Arabic villains for silent films despite being British. When he transitioned to sound films, his most famous role came in 1931\u2019s Frankenstein. While playing this classic monster was still silent, his subtle yet powerful performance wowed audiences which launched his classic horror film career. And if you want to hear his voice in full, just listen to him narrate the animated classic Christmas film How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\n\nSome stars may have succeeded with this transition, but sound movies ruined the careers of a lot of stars. According to Daily Telegraph, flapper sex symbol Clara Bow, known for her silent pantomime-style acting, said she \u201chated talkies\u201d calling them \u201cstiff and limiting.\u201d After all, hidden microphones restricted movements. Silent actors were used to directors screaming out directions while the cameras rolled as well as using exaggerated facial expressions and movements to convey emotion.\n\nActors like Douglas Fairbanks retired from acting when he was almost 50 after four \u201ctalkies\u201d as he felt technical restrictions ruined it for him. Mary Pickford won Best Actress for her role in Coquette, but she didn\u2019t enjoy the new changes to film either and retired in 1933 only returning to film with silent film star Charlie Chaplin in the mid-1950s.\n\nVilma Banky\u2019s popularity as a silent All-American character hit a decline when she revealed her Hungarian accent while playing a cook in This is Heaven. Charlie Chaplin resisted talking in movies because he also felt \u201ctalkies\u201d were a limited field. But, he was still willing to lend his voice when it counted, like when he delivered one of the best speeches you\u2019ll ever hear in a movie in The Great Dictator.\n\nSilent films and sound films clearly hit different nerves with different actors. Some actors used \u201ctalkies\u201d as an opportunity to show off their powerful voices and were seen in a new light and sound. Others felt more comfortable acting using movements and animated facial expressions. It\u2019s unfortunate that the challenging transition to sound led to early retirement for other actors, but they will always live on in the silent era film archive of cinema history."}, {"url": "https://www.moma.org/calendar/events/7214", "page_content": "If you would like to reproduce an image of a work of art in MoMA\u2019s collection, or an image of a MoMA publication or archival material (including installation views, checklists, and press releases), please contact Art Resource (publication in North America) or Scala Archives (publication in all other geographic locations).\n\nMoMA licenses archival audio and select out of copyright film clips from our film collection.

Postsynchronization enabled filmmakers to edit images freely again. Because the overwhelming emphasis of the period from 1928 to 1931 had been on obtaining high-quality sound in production, however, the idea that the sound track could be modified after it was recorded took a while to catch on. Many motion-picture artists and technicians felt that sound should be reproduced in films exactly as it had originally been produced on the set; they believed that anything less than an absolute pairing of sound and image would confuse audiences.\n\nFor several years, both practice and ideology dictated that sound and image be recorded simultaneously, so that everything heard on the sound track would be seen on the screen and vice versa. A vocal minority of film artists nevertheless viewed this practice of synchronous, \u201cnaturalistic\u201d sound recording as a threat to the cinema. In their 1928 manifesto \u201cSound and Image,\u201d the Soviet directors Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and Grigory Aleksandrov denounced synchronous sound in favour of asynchronous, contrapuntal sound\u2014sound that would counterpoint the images it accompanied to become another dynamic element in the montage process. Like the practical editing problem, the theoretical debate over the appropriate use of sound was eventually resolved by the practice of postsynchronization.\n\nPostsynchronization seems to have first been used by the American director King Vidor for a sequence in which the hero is chased through Arkansas swamplands in the all-Black musical Hallelujah (1929). Vidor shot the action on location without sound, using a freely moving camera. Later, in the studio, he added to the film a separately recorded sound track containing both naturalistic and impressionistic effects. In the following year Lewis Milestone\u2019s All Quiet on the Western Front and G.W. Pabst\u2019s Westfront 1918 both used postsynchronization for their battle scenes. Ernst Lubitsch used dubbing in his first American sound films, the dynamic musicals The Love Parade (1929) and Monte Carlo (1930), as did the French director Ren\u00e9 Clair in Sous les toits de Paris (Under the Roofs of Paris, 1930). In all these early instances, sound was recorded and rerecorded on a single track, although some American directors, including Milestone and the Russian-born Armenian Rouben Mamoulian (Applause, 1929; City Streets, 1931), had experimented with multiple microphone setups and overlapping dialogue as early as 1929. Generally, through 1932, either dialogue or music dominated the sound track unless they had been simultaneously recorded on the set. In 1933, however, technology was introduced that allowed filmmakers to mix separately recorded tracks for background music, sound effects, and synchronized dialogue at the dubbing stage. By the late 1930s, postsynchronization and multiple-channel mixing had become standard industry procedure."}], "Alan Dinehart appeared in popular films such as The Big Broadcast (1932), The Invisible Man (1933), and The Little Minister (1934).": [{"url": "https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events/2015/03/16/big-broadcast-milky-way", "page_content": "\n\nIn the late 1920s, the talkies introduced a wave of all-star revues, such as MGM\u2019s The Hollywood Revue of 1929 and Warner Bros.\u2019s The Show of Shows (1929), which were inspired by the boisterous spirit of vaudeville. Paramount used this variety format as a vehicle to showcase a dazzling array of radio personalities\u201415 total\u2014whose stardom was built on coast-to-coast radio programs, record sales and nightclub shows. Radio was in its golden age, and Hollywood had found ways to capitalize on its popularity.\n\nThe Big Broadcast stars Bing Crosby in his first major role in a feature. The crooner had made his screen debut in Universal\u2019s King of Jazz (1930) as part of The Rhythm Boys trio. Crosby later signed with Mack Sennett, starring in a string of successful musical comedy shorts. In The Big Broadcast, Crosby portrays a radio heartthrob whose perennial tardiness\u2014caused by Sharon Lynn\u2019s vampy Mona Lowe (a play on the tune \u201cMoanin\u2019 Low\u201d)\u2014leads a sponsor to pull the plug on the WADX station. When Mona jilts him for another man, the inconsolable (and inebriated) Bing enters a suicide pact with newfound friend Leslie (Stuart Erwin), an equally lovelorn Texas oilman. In the sober light of day, Leslie resolves to set things right by buying the radio station and preparing the next big broadcast.\n\nThe loose narrative interweaves performances by each of the radio talents, among them the Boswell Sisters, Cab Calloway (who steals the show with \u201cKickin\u2019 the Gong Around\u201d) and the Mills Brothers. Burns and Allen make their feature film debut as the distressed station manager and his birdbrained stenographer. Director Frank Tuttle, who had been making comedies since the early 1920s, further animates the film by employing a number of delightful camera tricks that harken back to slapstick two-reelers. The film proved to be a hit, prompting Paramount to revisit the variety format with International House (1933) and three more Big Broadcast pictures in the 1930s. \u2014Jennifer Rhee\n\nDirector: Frank Tuttle.

He blows all of the money that he won gambling and now needs a job. He asks for a job as mechanic at his brother-in-law. Beef's (James Gleason's) garage and gets one. It's not long before Gabby figures out that Beef is in cahoots with some car thieves in the same building as the auto repair shop. Here I have to get into architecture, because it has a major place in the plot. Beef's garage is in an eight story building. The repair shop is on the second floor, the auto paint shop that is fronting for the auto theft ring is on the sixth floor and a speakeasy is on the seventh. There is a circular ramp/driveway that connects the floors together so you can drive from the street all the way to the seventh floor if you wish.\n\n\n\nThrown into this mix is the marvelous Wynne Gibson as Silver, a saucy blonde who is the girlfriend of the titular head of the auto theft ring, Jenkins (Alan Dinehart). Gabby ends up towing her wrecked car one day, and the two embark on an affair punctuated with lots of precode dialogue that consists of rhetoric so ribald that I'm surprised it made it to the screen.\n\n\n\nGabby: What are you sitting on?\n\n\n\nSilver: Please judge, do I have to answer that?\n\n\n\nGabby figures the car thieves and Beef's involvement - he's doing it for extra cash for his wife and kid - is Beef's business. But then one day Beef's son and Gabby's nephew is run over by a speeding car and Gabby ties it to a stolen car that was speeding up the ramp where the garage is moments later. At this point, things get dicey.\n\n\n\nThis is a great precode with a marvelous cast. I always loved Edmund Lowe as the extremely flawed guy who is the private eye or the reporter or in this case just an average Joe who gets mixed up in a dangerous situation. This was a most unusual role for James Gleason, and you need to watch the film to see what I mean. Dickie Moore as Gleason's son is cute as a button. And Alan Dinehart as the titular head of the theft ring always excelled as the slimy weasel with a refined veneer. When you see the real brains of the ring - George Rossener - you figure out why there's a front man. He's playing a deaf mute, but he is also no fun to look at and has a perpetual scowl on his face.\n\n\n\nThen there are the strange little things that make the film such as the autopen that the mute gangster uses to communicate with Dinehart and a wedding chapel that is across the street from the garage where everybody who gets married gets interviewed by a radio host and then there is the little person groom at the beginning of the film who gets the last laugh.\n\n\n\nI'd highly recommend it as a great example of a precode film. It has everything - including that macabre scene I mentioned in the title. If anything sticks with you years after you see it, it will be that one scene."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022675/reviews", "page_content": "10 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nMusicals hadn't quite come back in fashion but one that certainly helped was \"The Big Broadcast\". Radio favourites had always been popular in the movies (\"Check and Double Check\" (1930) featuring Amos and Andy) even if only for the novelty, so Paramount was excited enough about a movie built around current radio stars to finance the short lived Broadway show \"Wild Waves\" in order to gain screen rights.\n\n\n\nThe slim story about an unreliable radio star was tailor made for Bing Crosby who actually played himself!! Frank Tuttle directed with a breezy comic style, featuring some visual gimmicks such as a black cat stopping in it's tracks and an opening which has radio acts coming to life from lobby photos and singing a few bars of a song which is associated with them. The surrealistic start combines rhythmic sound and action. Crosby, the station's popular star is late again but that doesn't deter Cab Calloway, who launches into the frenetic \"Hot Toddy\". When the station manager goes on the warpath the clock puts on an alarmed face, a black cat melts under a door and Cab Calloway's microphone even jumps along with the swinging beat. Bing is mobbed the instant he arrives and the crush carries him up in the lift and leaves him, lip stick smeared, at the microphone where he only has time for the last line of \"I Surrender, Dear\". This is a terrifically fun movie by the way. He instantly goes to the men's room where he gives a fantastic scat version of \"Dinah\" with the beat of the song provided by the shoe shine boy and his trusty towel and in another scene Bing gives a casual vocal treatment to \"Please\", accompanied by Eddie Lang on guitar - for me two of the movie's highlights.\n\n\n\nThe irate sponsor, Mr. Clapsaddle (George Barbier), gives the order - \"Bing must be sacked\"!!! Even the switchboard operators (a harmonizing trio called \"Major, Sharp and Minor\") get into the act with a Boswell inspired blues number - \"Have You Heard That Bing is Through\". Meanwhile Texas oil millionaire Leslie McWhinney (Stuart Erwin) is crying into his beer because \"a dame has taken him for all his dough\"!! He is in New York to look up the fianc\u00e9e that left him for the Big City - it is none other than Mr. Burn's (George Burns) efficient secretary (well efficient compared to Gracie) Anita (Leila Hyams). Bing also finds he is unlucky in love - his girl Mona Lowe (a play on the song \"Moanin' Low)(Sharon Lynne) has given him the air and to the strains of street singer Arthur Tracy's rendition of \"Here Lies Love\" he takes McWhinney back to his place. With the \"Crosby Cry\" in full force his rendition of \"Here Lies Love\" soon has McWhinney crying into his pillow and a very weird scene follows when they both decide to end it all but are stopped by the visiting ghost of Arthur Tracy!!!!\n\n\n\nMcWhinney hasn't lost all his money and buys the radio station to give as a wedding present to Anita and Bing. Yes, there is a muddled love triangle going on - Leslie loves Anita who is star struck about Bing but when Mona returns Bing is once again putty in her hands and it is doubtful if he will make it to the big broadcast that night. The radio stars were interspersed with the funny amblings of Leslie, on a night mission to see if he can secure a recording of \"Please\" as a backup in case of a Bing no show!! Definitely the highlights for me were the Mills Brothers performing \"Hold That Tiger\", the Boswell Sisters crazily scatting to \"Crazy People\" and Cab Calloway's zany drug inspired \"Kicking the Gong Around\". Not so pleasant was Kate Smith's very fruity interpretation of \"It Was So Beautiful\". I know she was known as the Songbird of the South but I think Annette Hanshaw's version is so much better. Kate Smith also owed the cameraman no favours and showed why she fared so much better on radio than she did on the movies.\n\n\n\nBing Crosby having just finished a series of two reel Mack Sennett shorts and bringing the same insouciant personality that he seemed to have in real life, fared the best but despite the popularity of the film it was almost five years before a follow up, \"The Big Broadcast of 1936\" was produced."}, {"url": "https://www.kozaksclassiccinema.com/the-big-broadcast-1932/", "page_content": "The Big Broadcast (1932). 80 minutes. Directed by Frank Tuttle. Starring Bing Crosby (as Bing Hornsby), Stuart Erwin (as Leslie McWhinney), Leila Hyams (as Anita Rogers), Sharon Lynn (as Mona Lowe), George Burns (as Mr. Burns), and Gracie Allen (as reception clerk). Featuring musical performances by Cab Calloway, The Mills Brothers, The Boswell Sisters, Vincent Lopez and His Orchestra, Eddie Lang, Donald Novis, Kate Smith, and Arthur Tracy.\n\nFor a modern audience, watching The Big Broadcast\u2014the first installment of the Big Broadcast film series that Paramount produced in the 1930s\u2014is like watching two different movies at once. On the one hand, it can be enjoyed as a nostalgic, even escapist trip through the past: the movie features a plethora of wonderful period musical acts (including Cab Calloway, The Boswell Sisters, and The Mills Brothers) and boasts some delightful vintage comedy in the form of radio stars George Burns and Gracie Allen. But at least as interesting is what makes the movie challenging and sometimes wonderfully unpalatable, including the somewhat surreal meta-comic plot where Bing Crosby essentially plays himself, which involves all of the weirdness that stems from a celebrity participating in a feature-length cameo on screen. The depiction is both celebratory (which we might expect) and oddly unflattering (which comes as more of a surprise): Bing is portrayed both as a magnetic crooner who is mobbed in public by crowds of desirous women and as a chronically late and suicidal loser. As a pre-Code film, The Big Broadcast presents us accordingly with taboo topics such as his attempted suicide and even domestic violence, using a light and humorous touch in treating these subjects that would have found repudiation under the enforcement of the Hollywood Production Code approximately two years later and is in questionable taste even today. Overall, the radio-friendly atmosphere combines with this edginess to form an at times bizarre film that manages to be both above-board and devious at the same time.\n\nIn the film, the habitually late Bing Hornsby misses a broadcast at radio station WADX, where he is employed as a regular performer, and is subsequently fired. He takes his termination in stride because he is getting married the next day to his girlfriend Mona, but he then learns that Mona has run off with another man. In a speakeasy, Bing commiserates with new acquaintance Leslie McWhinney, who has also been jilted, and the two end up at Bing\u2019s apartment, where Bing persuades Leslie to commit suicide with him. Leslie\u2019s ex-girlfriend Anita (who also works at Bing\u2019s former station) checks up on Bing, whom she is enamored with, and prevents the two from being successful in their attempt. Bing begins to date Anita.\n\nMeanwhile, the station manager Mr. Burns learns that WADX is bankrupt, and its assets are seized by the bank. Leslie surprises everyone by buying the station (it turns out that he is secretly a Texas oil tycoon) and by planning a big broadcast that will feature Bing and a cavalcade of stars, including The Boswell Sisters singing \u201cCrazy People,\u201d Cab Calloway performing \u201cKickin\u2019 the Gong Around,\u201d Kate Smith warbling \u201cIt Was So Beautiful,\u201d Donald Novis presenting a musical arrangement of the poem \u201cTrees,\u201d The Mills Brothers singing their hit \u201cTiger Rag,\u201d and Vincent Lopez and His Orchestra performing a fun percussion-based piece (\u201cDrummer Man\u201d). However, Bing feigns drunkenness on the night of the broadcast and tells Leslie that he is unable to perform; he has also left Anita to reunite with Mona. Leslie frantically scrambles to track down a record of Bing singing that he can use in place of the performer on the air, but his efforts to replace Bing are disastrous. In the nick of time, Bing shows up, bringing about Leslie and Anita\u2019s reconciliation (he has deliberately acted to repel her and bring them back together) and saving the show.\n\nIt is true that the film at times has the feel of a retro compilation of early 1930s\u2019 American radio stars performing their hit material. But far from being a mere relic of earlier times, The Big Broadcast pushes boundaries even in the twenty-first century. For example, the depiction of its protagonist is at times decidedly unpleasant for a mainstream Hollywood film, then or now. Because Bing plays a character referred to throughout by his own unusual first name, the film opens up the possibility for the audience to conflate the Bing we see on screen with the real Bing Crosby, and what we see on screen is not all good. From the very beginning, Bing is shown to be deficient in professionalism: he is chronically late to shows (he completely misses the broadcast in the first scene) and is fired just before the station is shut down. Leslie purchases the station for Anita but wants Bing to run it because the responsibility of doing so, Leslie says, may be just the thing Bing needs to whip him into shape\u2014a contrivance that acknowledges everyone\u2019s favorite crooner lacks maturity and respectability.\n\nThe Big Broadcast is eager to show us Bing\u2019s deficiencies as they apply to romance as well, where he is a cad at best. Bing steals Leslie\u2019s girlfriend Anita, then runs off with Mona without telling her. He also apparently physically assaults Mona before the big broadcast, giving her a black eye, and rather than repent for what he has done, creepily sings \u201cPlease\u201d to her in the last scene while making a fist and appearing to threaten her through the glass window of the studio. Moreover, the movie suggests (albeit in a playful fashion) that Bing, whose sexual magnetism on screen is tied to his musical prowess, is not even a skillful singer: Leslie, in his first scene with the crooner, does not recognize Bing and observes that his singing is flat and unaccomplished (\u201cMy voice slips like that, too, sometimes,\u201d he remarks). The Big Broadcast is the kind of movie that allows a character to say that to its hallowed star.\n\nBut perhaps none of that is as bewildering as the sustained episode where Bing attempts suicide with Leslie in his apartment during a power outage. To be fair, Leslie is the one who inadvertently introduces the idea of suicide to Bing, but Bing, who is deep in mourning for his lost love Mona, embraces the notion fully and quickly hatches a plan, bringing two funereal candles and pillows into the dark kitchen where they are to do the deed. With a smirk on his face and a near wink in his eye, Bing turns on the stove gas and the two lie back. As if all of this were not sufficiently bizarre, the kitchen radio, which is built into the wall, lights up and metamorphoses into an animated skull. It then changes into Arthur Tracy\u2019s singing head and his disembodied hands, which perform Bing\u2019s hit \u201cHere Lies Love\u201d on the accordion as animated mists from the gas swirl around playfully like spirits from a cartoon. The kitchen scene is reminiscent of the sort of Betty Boop short you might see during the Halloween season; we even hear a slide whistle and the sounds of tinkling bones, which come straight out of the early animation world.\n\nWhen Leslie begins to object to what they are doing and asks to open a window, Bing commands him to lie down\u2014at which point the independent nature of Leslie\u2019s participation seems to diminish and Bing inches closer to being culpable for Leslie\u2019s demise. Without a moment to spare, Anita and a porter that she has summoned appear at the door to check on Bing; they light a match to see better, and a loud explosion follows. No one is hurt, but the scene, up to and including its ending, is exceedingly macabre, presenting a suicide attempt that quickly metamorphoses into a potential act of manslaughter and reckless endangerment yet remains infused with romance, fantasy, and humor. Unbelievably Bing\u2019s own popular music and therefore his personal brand are linked to everything that we see; in the uninhibited times of pre-Code Hollywood, perhaps the risk to Bing\u2019s career posed by the suicide scene seemed less concerning. In any case, the attempt is treated so lightly and Bing\u2019s portrayal is so unsavory that it is hard to imagine the scene would be acceptable in any form under the Hollywood Production Code as it came to be enforced just a few years later, or even today.\n\nThe Big Broadcast remains provocative today due to its bizarre use of radio superstar Bing in these scenes, but one of its most flagrant displays of subversive behavior occurs in Cab Calloway\u2019s performance on the air, where the movie\u2019s pre-Code nature spills into the music studio. Calloway sings \u201cKickin\u2019 the Gong Around\u201d (a sequel to his well-known \u201cMinnie the Moocher\u201d), and as he narrates a scene full of \u201ccokies\u201d who are \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d and have run out of \u201cjunk\u201d in Chinatown, he appears to actually mime snorting cocaine out of his hand three separate times (pretending to arrange lines of the drug on his palm at one point); he then shudders with his upper torso and wipes his nose. Calloway\u2019s lyrics offer no condemnation of any of the drug users involved in the story that he tells, including his subject Minnie, who herself \u201ckick[s] the gong around\u201d (a euphemism for smoking opium):\n\nIt was down in Chinatown,\n\nAll the cokies laid around\u2014\n\nSome were high and some were mighty low.\n\nThere were millions on the floor\n\nWhen a knock came on the door,\n\nAnd there stood old Smoky Joe.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was sweatin\u2019, cold and pale,\n\nHe was lookin\u2019 for his frail,\n\nHe was broke and all his junk ran out.\n\nAs he stood and looked around,\n\nNobody made a sound,\n\nAnd then you hear old cokie shout:\n\n\n\nSaying, \u201cTell me where is Minnie?\n\nI want Minnie!\n\nHas she been here,\n\nKickin\u2019 the gong around?\u201d\n\nThere is something about watching him pretending to participate in the squalid drug use of the scene he narrates in his immaculate white tuxedo with tails that sends the movie right over the edge at that point. His appearance and demeanor while performing, including his signature and slightly surreal dancing, are magnetic and cool, making his behavior\u2014all of it\u2014not only entertaining but invigorating. \u201cKickin\u2019 the Gong Around\u201d is an unapologetic and brazen contribution to the film, and Calloway\u2019s performance ties with Bing\u2019s suicide scene for the honor of being the weirdest sequence we see.\n\nThe Big Broadcast contains a whole world of pre-Code oddities such as its ethically compromised main character, the bizarre suicide attempt, and Calloway\u2019s simulated snorting, but it also bears the playful sexual hallmarks of wilder cinematic times. For example, although Bing lives alone, nevertheless random women appear in his bathrobe and bedroom; in one scene, Leslie calls Bing\u2019s building manager to complain that Mona has been hiding there, reporting \u201cI just found a girl in our boudoir\u2014is that customary?\u201d In another scene, Anita appears nude in Bing\u2019s shower (discreetly but barely covered up by some well-placed hands and camera work). Bing, who thinks she is really Leslie, reaches over to the shower curtain for a bit of rough play with his friend and through the curtain smacks Anita on the bottom. He then accidentally drops his soap into the shower (while she is still nude behind the curtain) and gropes for it around her legs. In the same scene, Leslie absentmindedly dresses in Anita\u2019s discarded and lacy negligee.\n\nLeslie is not the only one linked to women\u2019s underwear (or cross-dressing) in this film, and what women (and men) are wearing close to their skin comes up in more than one conversation. At the station, when Anita is reading back a note she is writing for Mr. Burns about Bing\u2019s negligent behavior, she stumbles on the line, \u201cDuring the entire current week, you have been in a neg\u2026,\u201d to which Bing pops in and responds \u201cIn a negligee?\u201d It is not surprising that women\u2019s intimates are on his mind as the sponsor of WADX happens to be an underwear brand (the Good Tide Girdle Company). But our attention is drawn to the female anatomy when it is fully clothed as well. When Leslie is describing to Bing how Anita can dance, he implores Bing to \u201cfeel how solid she is\u201d (\u201cWhere?\u201d Bing asks, bewildered). Leslie then traces his hands over the space above her backside to emphasize how well it moves when she rhumbas. The Big Broadcast does not focus exclusively on sexual gags, either visual or verbal\u2014for movies that are more in that vein, I recommend other pre-Code films such as Murder at the Vanities (1934) or Baby Face (1933)\u2014but they do make for a film that has a free-and-easy way with sexual mores.\n\nThe sexual comedy can come off as risqu\u00e9, perhaps even vulgar, but elsewhere in the film the humor is less sex-centric and still very funny. For example, the exchanges between Burns and Allen around the radio station have a beautiful comic rhythm. The first time we see Bing is also amusing: he is identified in the streets on his way to the studio by a horde of adoring female fans that attacks him and grasps for his dropped glove as if it were the relic of someone holy. The soundtrack switches to the Yale fight song for the occasion as Bing is smothered with heavy lipstick kisses and mistakenly grabs a lady\u2019s hat to wear back to the studio instead of his own.\n\nThere is also the long sequence where Leslie learns that Bing is drunk and unable to perform (he is only pretending to be drunk), and seeks out a record of Bing singing \u201cPlease\u201d to play on the big broadcast in the singer\u2019s absence. As Leslie passes from an apartment building to a record store to the studio lobby, the multiple copies of the record he obtains are obliterated in fantastic ways. (Watching the many, many records destroyed over the course of this sequence, especially the hundreds that drop and shatter in the record shop, may bring some pain to audiophiles.) Interestingly, while Leslie\u2019s journey to the studio has an instrumental soundtrack and notable sound effects, it is filmed as a silent montage, without dialogue, and relies heavily on the use of gesture to convey meaning. The silent-era comedy of the sequence is amusing but also lends a neat structural counterpoint to the sounds of the big broadcast that is taking place simultaneously at the radio station.\n\nIn addition to the clever use (and avoidance of) sound in the final sequence, The Big Broadcast harkens back to the visual ingenuity of artier silent fare as it establishes a playful and energetic atmosphere. For example, when the Good Tide Girdle Company owner complains that Crosby is late to an on-air performance, we see a shot of his hand banging repeatedly on Mr. Burns\u2019s desk. The film cuts from this shot to a shot of what we will learn is Bing\u2019s hand banging on a taxi\u2019s steering wheel horn in a quick transition that keeps us on our feet. The stylish editing is supported by stylish camera work: in the first performance by Cab Calloway\u2019s band, the camera follows the trombone player up and down the length of his instrument, and the string bass is traced from low to high as well. When the camera is focused on Calloway\u2019s conducting, it cranes down and towards him in a moving shot. Later when The Boswell Sisters are seated at a telephone switchboard, we see them in a shot from above, swaying and humming. There is also the angled shot of the record shop owner yelling at Leslie from his apartment over the store, and a long tracking shot of Leslie running along the station hallway on the night of the big broadcast. Many of these shots and transitions are reminiscent of some of the better silent-era European movies from only a few years earlier, and together they combine to make The Big Broadcast a pleasure to watch.\n\nWe might reflect that in spite of the successful comic content, much of the film remains offbeat, even potentially unsettling, but there is at least one way in which Bing\u2019s plotline overcomes its peculiar nature and becomes, in a way, chic\u2014namely, because Bing loses by reuniting with the loathsome Mona in a relationship that is, to say the least, unadmirable. In other films, Bing is typically portrayed as a cool cat crooner who glides through his career with a hip but understated sense of humor, and while he is undoubtedly associated with what would become his characteristic laissez-faire attitude and easygoing demeanor in films such as Holiday Inn (1942) and later White Christmas (1954), The Big Broadcast is willing to commit to the idea of Bing as loser all the way to the end. The result is that Bing appears both radically undesirable and undeniably smooth as he allows the film to poke holes in his celebrity veneer. It is admittedly not a mainstream Hollywood ending, but it is a refreshingly twisted way of appreciating a mega-star at the start of his career."}, {"url": "https://letterboxd.com/film/the-big-broadcast/", "page_content": "The first and the best of the \u2018Big Broadcast\u2019 movies.\n\nA grand collection of acts singing with the comedy of Burns&Allen.\n\nWhat held the action together is the backstage view of how a 1932 radio station operated.\n\nBing Crosby in real life liked the idea of recording his shows , he invested in new technologies that allowed him to do the East coast shows live, but play recordings unbeknownst to the other time zones."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029912/reviews", "page_content": "7 /10\n\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nEssentially, a variety show, with the uniting plot theme of a race between 2 ocean liners: the Colossal, and the newer and bigger Gigantic. The race is from NYC to Cherbourg ,France, in about 2 1/2 days. The first third of the film is dominated by the hijinks of Bob Hope(as Buzz Fielding) and especially W.C. Fields, as both T.F. and S.B. Bellows, who own the Gigantic. S.B. is the younger, goofier, brother. T.F. arranges for him to be on the Colossal, so that he can hopefully pull some stunt that will cause it to lose the race. We see T.F only briefly, at the beginning.\n\n\n\nHope begins in jail on a delinquent alimony charge. He's supposed to be the emcee for the variety show to be held on the Gigantic. His 3 ex-wives, as a group, come to see him in jail, but don't offer to bail him out. However, current girlfriend Dorothy(Lamour) does get him released in time to board the liner and take his position. His wives(Shirley Ross, as Cleo, Grace Bradley, as Grace, and Virginia Vale, as Joan) evidently find out about his release and board the ship to try to discourage him from marrying a fourth, who will cut in on their alimony payments(assuming he can make them). Hope has a $50,000. bet on the Gigantic to win, so the ex-wives want to make sure they get a slice of that, if the Gigantic wins.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, S.B. takes his car to a filling station. A misunderstanding leads to one of his tires overinflating, causing a massive blowout. With just 3 tires, he drives off after tossing his partially used cigar out the window. He knocks over one of the gas pumps on his exit, causing gasoline to spray out on his still lit cigar, resulting in an explosion engulfing the filling station. Ignoring the destruction and probable deaths he has caused, he takes in a round of golf. He has a whole bevy of caddies and irons, and gets around in his specially modified golf bike, with folded wings that stick up from the sides, and a propeller behind. After a series of irregularities in his golf game, he calls it a day, pushes down his folded wings, turns on his propeller and takes off, flying over the ocean toward the 2 liners. He makes a perfect landing on the Gigantic, whether by accident or design. Aboard, S.B. soon causes important mischief when he touches the end of his umbrella to one of the giant coils that powers the radio transmitter, causing a cloud of smoke and sparks.(Why he wasn't killed nor even harmed isn't explained!). This puts the transmitter out of service for a while, which means it can't be used to power the ship(?) past the Colossal, which is well ahead. Later, it's discovered that a piece of the umbrella was touching a coil, shorting out the transmitter. With this removed, the transmitter is again working and begins to greatly accelerate the Gigantic. Later, he would play a game of 'dirty pool', with many irregularities.\n\n\n\nAt about the half way mark, Martha Raye finally makes an appearance. She is one of several survivors of a sunken yacht, and is S.B.'s daughter, with a similar penchant for accidentally causing problems. She used her legendary big mouth to blow the lifeboat sail toward the Gigantic. Aboard, she immediately starts to shatter windows and mirrors with her supposed ugliness. Her biggest contribution to the ongoings was to sing the spritely romantic ditty \"Mama, that Moon is Here Again\", initially mainly to her new beloved: Scoop(Lynn Overmann). While still singing it, she was then tossed and swung around by a bevy of sailors. Later, as part of the big production in which the history of dance is sampled, she would lead a group sing and dance of the exuberant 'Truckin'(They're going Hollywood in Harlem). I could have used more songs and skits featuring Martha. She was such a unique talent.\n\n\n\nAmong the other talents, Shep Fields and his band played a number that included a cartoon segment. Tito Guizar sang a couple of songs, followed by Dorothy Lamour, who serenaded her new found love: Leif Erikson, with the Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin romantic ballad \"You Took the Words Right Out of my Heart\". Later, she would do an encore. Kirsten Flagstad did an excellent rendition of Wagner's \"Brunnhilde's Battle Cry\" Patricia Wilder was supposed to do a little comedy and song act, but it was a nothing. Incidentally, Ben Blue's attempts at comedy stank, as usual.\n\n\n\nRainger and Robin composed the most remembered new song \"Thanks for the Memories\", with Hope and Shirley Ross going back and forth, singing the lyrics, which involve remembering the good times they used to have together....Lastly, a series of old and new songs were sung and danced to in a celebration of various dance forms through history. Pleasant, but unmemorable."}, {"url": "https://immortalephemera.com/12668/lawyer-man-1932-william-powell-joan-blondell/", "page_content": "It was an impassioned courtroom defense made by Lionel Barrymore in A Free Soul (1931) that won him the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1931. Talking pictures are just a natural for lawyers, after all, who can talk like a mouthpiece? In November 1931 Counsellor-at-Law starring Paul Muni as George Simon would open on Broadway and be the longest running play of the season. It'd be made into a film by Universal that was released at the end of 1933. Counsellor at Law, the film (minus the hyphens), replaced Muni with John Barrymore, who also played a lawyer in 1932's State's Attorney at RKO, a movie which credits Gene Fowler as one of the writers.\n\nIn 1931 Fowler had published The Great Mouthpiece , a life of the colorful real-life lawyer, William J. Fallon. Fallon earned hefty fees successfully defending the notorious in cases as dramatic as the films which would follow. He spent big too and became quite popular along the Great White Way, especially with the ladies. The best portrayal of Fallon is Warren William's breakout role in The Mouthpiece, also 1932. From late that same year came Warner Brothers' Lawyer Man, starring William Powell as a fast-talking, leg-loving defender in the Fallon tradition, Anton Adam.\n\nLawyer Man premiered in New York on Christmas Eve, 1932 but didn't go into general release until January 7, 1933. Thus the conflicting release dates you'll see with this title.\n\nIt's interesting to note that very little of Lawyer Man actually takes place in court. The best scenes of The Mouthpiece came inside the courtroom where audiences got to see William's Fallon character, Vince Day, in action molding the law to his own purposes and often shocking his own clients with his brazenness. Lawyer Man, on the other hand, goes out of its way to avoid the courtroom, keeping the focus on the hallways during trials and muting what went on behind the court's closed doors. Lawyer Man, like the title says, is about the man.\n\nAt the start of Lawyer Man defense attorney Anton Adam is a man of the people, bumping shoulders in the crowded Manhattan Streets and taking on charity cases at his East Side offices where his secretary Olga (Joan Blondell) micro-manages his professional life with hopes of taming Adam's private life as well. But Anton loves a pretty girl, his eyes drawn to every pair of shapely legs in their path, leaving the childlike Ogla to huff and puff in frustration whenever Anton is distracted by a new woman.\n\nDespite the seemingly meager setting of Adam's law office he manages to crush well-heeled prosecutor Granville Bentley (Alan Dinehart) in a case and receives a call to come to Bentley's offices for a meeting. While Olga is especially nervous about Bentley's invitation, a reserved Anton arrives, still looking a bit shabby, and is surprised with an offer of a partnership by the uptown lawyer. He's moving on up. The vast Bentley and Adam offices not only have a fantastic view of the city, but they come with legs attached, as Anton is soon in the clutches of Bentley's sister, Babs, played by uptown vamp Helen Vinson.\n\nAfter whipping local political boss Gilmurry (David Landau) in a case, Anton bumps into him in a club and Gilmurry does his best to get Anton to jump over to his side. Anton isn't going for that, but he is going for Claire Dodd, playing actress Ginny St. Johns, an acquaintance of Gilmurry's. Ginny is all over Anton and gets him excited professionally as well when she has him initiate a breach of promise suit for her against a city hall doctor named Gresham (Kenneth Thomson). Gresham's brother is a judge and both men are Gilmurry cronies. Partner Bentley warns Anton to stay away from a case as trashy as this, but Anton, as always, has something to prove and is smitten with Ginny as well, so he's working doubly hard.\n\nSo he's got Joan Blondell making big eyes at him in his office; he's got Helen Vinson playing cat and mouse with him from up above his usual sphere; and he's got Claire Dodd clinging to him out on the town. Poor guy. But it all cracks pretty quick when Dodd's Ginny tells him she wants to drop her case and Gresham, with Ginny's help, records Anton telling her the case is too valuable to drop. Anton is indicted and Bentley dissolves the partnership. Vinson's Babs becomes unreachable. Professionally broken Anton goes begging to Gilmurry who tells him he's a wash-out and he wants no part of him.\n\n\"Everybody's walked out on you but the landlord,\" Blondell says. Anton replies softly to Olga, \"Except you.\" He looks out amongst the people of the city, \"pushing, shoving, trampling each other,\" and declares that \"They made a shyster out of me. Okay. I'll be the biggest, busiest shyster that ever hit this town.\" Anton pushes himself into full Fallon mode, always making sure to grab a sizable cut. Opportunity knocks once more when he has the opportunity to squeeze Gilmurry.\n\nAnton is an interesting character in that no matter how much he gouges his clients it's pretty clear that money is not his primary motivation. Here he differs from the real Fallon and from William's Vince Day, who appear to have worshiped the almighty dollar over all. For William Powell's Anton Adam power is the motivation. What's more, it's an in-your-face kind of power preceded by a cry of \"I'll show you,\" before knuckling down and actually showing them.\n\nWhile Bentley and Babs and Ginny St. Johns will disappear once and for all, and while the relationship with Blondell's Olga is supposed to be the common thread throughout Anton Adam's life and career, I found his uneasy interaction with Gilmurry to be the most interesting facet of Lawyer Man. In another movie Gilmurry would be the strong arm and Adam would be trying to literally save his own skin after double-crossing him. Not in Lawyer Man.\n\nOh sure, Gilmurry has thugs (fresh faced Allen Jenkins and Jack La Rue!), but his meetings with Adam always remain cordial. When Powell's Adam stalls Gilmurry prior to a meeting and Gilmurry enters Adam's office to find him putting together a jigsaw puzzle he isn't insulted, he just kind of smirks. They have their talk, then Gilmurry, looming over Adam's desk casually grabs a piece of the puzzle and puts it in place. It's a nice little touch to show business is business, but these men really don't dislike one another.\n\nYes, Adam and Gilmurry insult each other freely, but neither seems to take the others words too hard, perhaps because they can see the truth in what the other man says. At one point Adam puts the squeeze on Gilmurry for an extra $10,000 in fees. Gilmurry not only pays but makes Adam an offer to come work for him.\n\nGilmurry is played by David Landau, a character actor who appeared in over 30 films from 1931-34. He died in September 1935, age 56. Landau had a long career on the stage prior to coming to Hollywood, which best I can tell began around the turn of the century. He worked in a stock company owned by Charles B. Newhall and married Newhall's daughter, Frances, in 1903. In 1906 Frances convinced her husband to change his name from David Magee to David Landau and from that time going forward Landau's name regularly appears in the dramatic sections of the New York newspapers. His gruff voice and craggy long face made Landau a great villain on the screen for the short time he was able to play on it. In Lawyer Man he's more disreputable than villainous, but he's excellent nonetheless.\n\nLawyer Man is the last of 10 films made featuring hardworking Joan Blondell in 1932. I think you could make the case that Powell's presence looms so largely over Lawyer Man that any actress could have played Olga, but I'm still glad it was Blondell. While Helen Vinson and Claire Dodd just have to make an entrance to get a leading man drooling, the pure and sassy Blondell provides a definite balance and at least one woman to root for in Lawyer Man. The problem is Olga's only goal is Anton and since she works for him she can't be too aggressive about it. She's the voice that's always in his ear, but Anton has to fall down several times before he begins to hear her. Blondell's energy upgrades the role of Olga from a part we'd otherwise forget to someone for us to pull for amongst the muck and corruption surrounding everyone else, including even Anton.\n\nWhile I'd take Vince Day and The Mouthpiece over Anton Adam and Lawyer Man any day, William Powell is still perfect for this part. On the heels of two other pre-code gems for Warner's, Jewel Robbery and One Way Passage (both 1932), Powell continues to be the slick and fast talking leading man that we sometimes forget existed prior to The Thin Man. It may be a bit early for the debonair label which always seems to find him, but Powell, circa 1932, sure is a charmer!\n\nWhen the staid Alan Dinehart proposes a partnership because he's \"not a spellbinder when it comes to juries,\" we know that any mouthpiece William Powell plays is. And again, we barely get to see Powell in the courtroom, but because of who he is, and how confident his Anton Adam is throughout Lawyer Man, we know he would be fantastic in front of any jury. Lionel Barrymore needed that courtroom speech to cop his Oscar for A Free Soul; With Powell the performance is implied.\n\nLawyer Man has been a favorite in my collection of movies for quite some time now. I often watch it back to back with The Mouthpiece, the similarities of which should now be obvious. I've always found both movies underrated and generally overlooked and have wished to see both get the wider audience that comes with a mainstream DVD release for several years now. While I can understand how The Mouthpiece has managed to avoid rediscovery, I can't say the same for Lawyer Man given the presence of two major and perpetually beloved stars in William Powell and Joan Blondell.\n\nFans of movies about lawyers should really check this one out and William Powell fans simply have to see Lawyer Man.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Actor's Widow Bares Poverty.\" Oakland Tribune 24 September 1935: 16.\n\n\"In Other Days.\" Oakland Tribune 13 October 1935: 29.\n\n\"Portrait of a Lawyer.\" Galveston Daily News 11 October 1931: 13.\n\nRelated Links:\n\nThe Great Mouthpiece by Jacob A.

I can't think of any actor who used it more often or better for comic effect. In \"Lawyer Man,\" he must have done a dozen or more double takes. They range from the obvious scene stoppers of a knowing look on his face and turn of the head, to more subtle light pauses with a stern or amusing look as if to catch a breath. We see the first big one in the opening scene when he is stepping out of his office building onto an open market street on New York's East Side.\n\n\n\nAn iceman is delivering a block of ice and is entering the building with it over his shoulder. Powell's character, Anton Adam, says, \"Good morning, Jake. How's the ice business?\" Iceman, \"Not so hot.\" Powell pauses a second and turns his head toward the iceman who has passed him in the doorway. There's no way the audience could miss the humor of the dialog with Powell's double take that allows just enough time for it to sink in. One might say the double take multiplies (doubles) the comedy of the lines.\n\n\n\nThis movie isn't billed as a comedy, and one can see why. It's one of the earliest films about city machine politics and corruption, and shady aspects of a political justice system. But, this drama and crime movie has a good dose of comedy. It's mostly in Powell's character, rather than situations. This is the story about a New York East Side (of the 1930s) lawyer who makes good and moves up to Park Avenue.\n\n\n\nAdam has been in the East Side defending the poor and the down and out for some years. He is well known and liked in the neighborhood, and by the cops and by others in his profession. He then tackles a case that beats the political machinery. That starts him on a rise and track of prominence. After a double-cross by the machine connections, his reputation is hurt among the high-class set. So, he starts over defending low-life criminals and others. But now he takes some shady cases and charges them accordingly. He has become a shyster, in his own words. There's nothing in the film that indicates he did anything illegal himself, but that he was defending a lot of people who were shady operators and getting them off. He wins and builds himself back up.\n\n\n\nWhen he gets appointed assistant district attorney, he comments about being back on the right side of the law. Indeed, Anton Adam's character seems to have high ideals about justice. In a very early scene, he turns down a case from a man who he says must come to justice. When the man leaves and Adam's secretary comes into the office, Adam says of the guy, \"Just a small-time mouse trying to be a big time rat.\"\n\n\n\nJoan Blondell is Olga Michaels, Adam's long-time and faithful secretary and confidant. She's crazy in love with the guy, but keeps her composure, and he doesn't know it until toward the end of the film. Adam has one weakness, which we see in his glances at pretty women. It's likely more in his head than in practice, though, because when he gets with an attractive stage performer, he is shy and awkward.\n\n\n\nOlga knows his weakness, and some of the humor of the film is when she brings him up short for it. An exchange between the two sums up the situation. Olga, \"I worked for a successful man once, and you know why he was a success?\" Anton, \"Sure, because you worked for him.\" Olga, \"No! 'Cause he left the dames alone.\" After the double- cross, Olga says to Anton, \"That's what happens when a smart lawyer gets mixed up with a dumb blonde.\"\n\n\n\nThe supporting cast in \"Lawyer Man\" are all very good. David Landau is especially good as John Gilmurry who runs the local political machine. Alan Dinehart plays Granville Bentley, the Park Avenue attorney whom Adam beats in a big case and who then invites Adam to be his partner. Claire Dodd is very good as Virginia St. Johns and Allen Jenkins plays a usual heavy or hooligan role as Izzy Levine.\n\n\n\nThis is a very good film that most adults should enjoy. Here are a couple more favorite lines from the movie.\n\n\n\nOlga, \"Who's gonna take your case?\" Anton, \"I am. I know. I have a sap for a client.\"\n\n\n\nOlga, \"Remember, I told you about taking these cases against those big uptown lawyers. They got too much pull.\" Anton, \"Yeah, well I got a lot of push.\"\n\n\n\nOn a historical note for younger generations, the iceman was a common site in America before the mid-20th century. In the years before electric refrigerators, the iceman delivered blocks of ice to homes that had iceboxes. The lady of the house would use an ice pick to chip the ice block into pieces to fit in the top of the icebox. The term \"icebox\" continued to be used for decades, referring to the refrigerator. More than a few early crime movies had murders committed with ice picks. I doubt if one could be found in a 21st century home."}, {"url": "https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?year=1932&title_type=feature&", "page_content": "69 min | Drama, Music, Mystery\n\n5.7 Rate this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 5.7 / 10 X\n\nThirteen years ago, somebody murdered the wealthy host of a dinner party.
