However, after the tragic death of vocalist Dolores O\u2019Riordan, on January 15, the mooted anniversary edition of their landmark record was put on hold while the band mourned the sudden and unexpected loss of their friend. Eventually, though, The Cranberries\u2019 instrumental trio \u2013 guitarist Noel Hogan, his bassist brother Mike and drummer Fergal Lawlor \u2013 made the unanimous decision to press ahead with the reissue of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?.\n\nListen to the super deluxe edition of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? now.\n\nFounding member Noel Hogan was Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s songwriting partner in The Cranberries and, as he told us in an exclusive interview, their debut album still \u201cjust sounds like a great collection of songs.\u201d Yet, as he goes on to reveal, when the young Irish teenagers began learning their craft in Limerick, the idea that they could possibly experience mainstream success was beyond their comprehension.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis was around the time of The Joshua Tree, and U2 were just massive,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cIf you thought Irish rock music, you thought U2, but that was way out of our reach. Coming from a small town in the south of Ireland, we thought no further than forming a band and playing a local club in front of a few friends if ever we got good enough. Really, we would have been content with that.\u201d\n\nAs Hogan freely admits, he started the band with his brother and long-time school friend Lawlor \u201cwithout even knowing a chord.\u201d Yet the trio were galvanized by punk\u2019s DIY ethic and their collective love of classic English indie-pop acts such as The Cure and Echo & The Bunnymen. This led to The Cranberries\u2019 initial line-up: a much quirkier affair known as The Cranberry Saw Us featuring the Hogans, Lawlor and local singer-songwriter Niall Quinn. The latter\u2019s tenure was brief, but he later introduced the band to Dolores O\u2019Riordan: a friend of Quinn\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s sister and also a budding local singer-songwriter.\n\n\u201cThat day changed our lives\u201d\n\n\u201cWe played a few songs for her, then she sang Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u2018Troy\u2019 and a couple of songs she\u2019d written, and it was obvious she could sing, so that was it \u2013 she was in,\u201d Noel Hogan says, recalling the classic line-up\u2019s embryonic first rehearsal.\n\n\u201cI gave her a cassette with the music for \u2018Linger\u2019 on it,\u201d he adds, \u201cand a few days later, Dolores brought it back with all the words and the song that we now all know. That was the first song we wrote together. At the time, it was just another song and another day, but years later I realize how much that day changed our lives.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries - Linger (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHaving found the final piece of their puzzle with O\u2019Riordan, The Cranberries sporadically performed low-key local gigs and began looking for a deal when they had a set of songs in place. Hogan, for one, was determined the band would bypass the small and insular Irish club circuit and send their first demo direct to London.\n\nRemarkably, the tape immediately received a positive response from Rough Trade\u2019s Geoff Travis (later to become their manager). While they didn\u2019t sign to Travis\u2019 label, the enthusiastic response later set off a bidding war in London, with numerous major labels keen to sign the band.\n\nNoel Hogan elaborates: \u201cIsland were actually the last label to show an interest, but their A&R guy, Denny Cordell, was just completely different to the others. He was an English guy based in New York. He\u2019d produced [Procol Harum\u2019s] \u2018A Whiter Shade Of Pale,\u2019 he knew [Island boss] Chris Blackwell and the whole business inside out, but he was realistic too. Unlike the other labels, he didn\u2019t promise us the world. We just had a feeling about him and, thankfully, we were right. He died early, sadly, but he always believed in us and if it wasn\u2019t for Denny, we\u2019d never have taken off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe perfect time and place\u201d\n\nAfter the initial album sessions at The Cranberries\u2019 demo studio in Limerick failed to work out, the band asked Island if they could work with Stephen Street. As his CV included engineering and production credits with The Smiths and on Morrissey\u2019s Viva Hate solo album, O\u2019Riordan and company were big fans, but they felt they were chancing their arm when they suggested hooking up with the much in-demand producer.\n\nAs it turned out, Street had already seen The Cranberries play at London\u2019s Marquee and immediately saw their potential. After an initial trial session which pleased all concerned, the producer \u2013 whose credits also include Blur and Kaiser Chiefs \u2013 signed up to man the console for the Everybody Else Is Doing It\u2026 sessions.\n\n\u201cWe more or less knew what we wanted, but not quite how to get it, and that\u2019s where Stephen comes in,\u201d Hogan reveals. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t completely change what you have, but he always wants to explore your ideas \u2013 he\u2019s great at fine-tuning your music and keeping you focused. You look forward going to the studio every day with Stephen and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent 30 years working with him. We\u2019ve the greatest respect for him.\u201d\n\nNoel Hogan remembers Everybody Else Is Doing It\u2026 as \u201cthe perfect time and place for us,\u201d and that everything slotted into place for them artistically. Yet, while the band felt they had a great debut under their belt, the initial response to the album was lukewarm.\n\nFearing that their time had come and gone, the band set off on tour, accepting a mismatched opening slot for The Hothouse Flowers. However, while they slogged around half-empty European concert halls, Noel Hogan and company were completely oblivious to what was happening across the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cWe were about a month into the European tour and we get a call out of the blue, requesting we come to the States,\u201d he remembers. \u201cDenny Cordell had been working on [the album\u2019s] first single, \u2018Linger,\u2019 in New York and it had become a hit on college radio, where it had gone to No.8. Suddenly, from thinking we were about to get dropped by Island, we went to play our first American gig in Denver, Colorado, opening for The The. We went onstage and everyone knew the songs and the place just went mental.\n\n\u201cOvernight, it literally went from us thinking our career was dead to this \u2013 and from then on, it went from strength to strength. MTV picked up on \u2018Linger\u2019 and put it on heavy rotation and off we went.\u201d\n\n\u201cSongs I honestly feel have stood the test of time\u201d\n\nWith a buzz building around the band, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? went on to enjoy a remarkable second life in the UK and Europe. Underlining the quality of Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s haunting, ethereal vocals, and the band\u2019s sophisticated melodicism, the album\u2019s signature tracks, \u201cLinger\u201d and \u201cDreams,\u201d both cracked the UK Top 30, with the album itself topping the British charts in the summer of 1994 and moving over six million copies worldwide.\n\nThe Cranberries - Dreams (Dir: Peter Scammell) (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOn its own, the newly-remastered Everybody Else Is Doing Is, So Why Can\u2019t We? reminds us why its reputation as one of the key alt-rock albums of the 90s remains gloriously intact, but its new edition also offers a wealth of rare and previously unreleased material that paints a bigger picture.\n\nEarly demo recordings reveal how The Cranberries often reworked and honed their songs\u2019 arrangements, while their radio sessions for the BBC\u2019s John Peel and Irish DJ Dave Fanning are joined by valuable rarities including the eerie, Irish-language \u201c\u00cdosa\u201d and the first-ever demo recording of \u201cDreams\u201d: the latter mastered from a cassette Noel Hogan came upon in his garage completely by accident.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t listened to the album front to back in 20 years, so when I heard the remastered version at Abbey Road in February, I was genuinely shocked by how good it sounded,\u201d Noel Hogan confesses. \u201cIt was only about a month after Dolores\u2019 death, so hearing her voice was emotional, obviously, but even so, I was really surprised and delighted that four young kids from Limerick could produce an album with songs I honestly feel have stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nThis feature was first published in late 2018. We are re-publishing it today in celebration of the March 1, 1993, release of the album. The 25th-anniversary edition of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? is out now."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/08/the-cranberries-how-we-made-linger-dolores-oriordan-noel-hogan", "page_content": "Dolores O\u2019Riordan, singer-songwriter\n\nBands in Limerick just did cover versions, so when I met this group called The Cranberry Saw Us, I was immediately impressed: they wanted to write their own songs. They couldn\u2019t really play, which was part of their charm. Noel Hogan, their guitarist, used to make up his own chords, sometimes with just one finger. Linger was the first song we wrote. Initially, it was just a chord shape, with no real melody or lyrics. I took a tape of it home and came up with a verse and chorus. I wrote about being rejected. I never imagined that that it would become a big song.\n\nIt was inspired by a night I had at a club called Madonna\u2019s. This guy asked me to dance and I thought he was lovely. Until then, I\u2019d always thought that putting tongues in mouths was disgusting, but when he gave me my first proper kiss, I did indeed \u201chave to let it linger\u201d. I couldn\u2019t wait to see him again. But at the next disco, he walked straight past me and asked my friend to dance. I was devastated. Everyone saw me being dumped, publicly, at the disco. Everything\u2019s so dramatic when you\u2019re 17, so I poured it into the song.\n\nI was in a shop buying underwear and about some fans spotted me. I had to run away and hide behind a skip\n\nAs a teenager, I felt unattractive. My mum wouldn\u2019t let me wear makeup. While my friends were all getting dolled up and using sunbeds, I was the overprotected, awkward girl in a pink flowery dress with bows in her hair, who played the organ in the church. My mother bought my clothes, so at the first photoshoot for the Cranberries, as the band was now called, Noel brought me an outfit and gave me a pair of Doc Martens. They were too big for me, but I put them on anyway. Suddenly I looked like an indie girl.\n\nLinger was a worldwide smash. Fans were chasing me all over. Once, I was in a shop buying underwear and about eight people spotted me. I started running and after three blocks hid behind a skip. Some years later, after I was married, the guy Linger is about wrote me a long letter, saying: \u201cI know the song\u2019s about me. I never meant to hurt your feelings. Can we meet?\u201d I thought: \u201cIt\u2019s too late. You dumped me!\u201d I didn\u2019t reply.\n\nNoel Hogan, guitarist-songwriter\n\nWe were terrible when we started. I knew about five chords and four of them are probably in Linger. But when Dolores heard the monotonous loops that would become Linger, she knew they had potential.\n\nWe scraped together money for a demo and sent it to record companies. When Island signed us, we asked if we could work with Stephen Street, because he was the Smiths\u2019 producer and we all loved them. In the studio, I kept thinking: \u201cHe used to sit with Johnny Marr, and now he\u2019s sat with me.\u201d I tried to play it cool but couldn\u2019t help myself and started grilling him about the Smiths.\n\nThe magnitude of Linger\u2019s success was overwhelming. Michael Stipe came to the video shoot and the next thing we knew we were on tour with REM. I remember at this massive gig gazing out at 50,000 people and thinking: \u201cNot so long ago I was sat in my parents\u2019 kitchen.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries\u2019 new album, Something Else, is out now. The tour starts on 17 May at Belfast Waterfront.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/13/she-was-on-a-roll-the-cranberries-on-the-last-days-of-dolores-oriordan", "page_content": "The last time the Cranberries guitarist Noel Hogan saw Dolores O\u2019Riordan was in the Limerick hotel where we are now standing, in November 2017. He had agreed to do an interview with a Chinese journalist: the band are huge in China, apparently, and had a run of arena gigs booked there. O\u2019Riordan was living in New York and she wanted distraction; she decided, in a typically whimsical move, to come to meet the journalist, too, taking the direct flight to Shannon airport. She was in good spirits, although ongoing back problems \u2013 a slipped disc, from picking up a guitar \u2013 had led to a cancelled tour that summer.\n\nChristmas came and went, but the Cranberries were still recording. O\u2019Riordan would send Hogan vocals by email. On 14 January, she emailed him new songs: she had flown to London to mix an album with her side project D.A.R.K. At 1.12am on 15 January, calling from the Park Lane Hilton, she left a friend an excited voicemail in which she said a new recording was sounding \u201cfucking terribly good\u201d. At 2am, she spoke to her mother. Later that night, she died. I meet the band four days before an inquest ruled that the 46-year-old had drowned accidentally in the bath, with high levels of alcohol in her blood. Hogan looks around the lobby and says it is hard to believe that the last time he saw her it was somewhere so mundane.\n\nLetting it Linger \u2026 remaining Cranberries Fergal Lawler, Noel and Mike Hogan. Photograph: Patrick Bolger/The Guardian\n\nOn the top floor, with its views out over the Shannon river, three Cranberries bear the mark of men still coming to terms with bereavement. Like many bands who lose a member, they threw themselves into activity. Their new album was nearly finished, so they completed it; April and May passed by in a blur. The strangest thing, they tell me, was that working in the studio was not all that different. The three of them would always record by day and Dolores would come in to sing at night, alone, with producer Stephen Street.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d pass each other in the corridor,\u201d says bassist Mike Hogan, Noel\u2019s brother, who was only 20 when the band achieved international fame. \u201cDolores would say: \u2018You know that thing you recorded?\u2019 I\u2019d say: \u2018You mean the thing that took me five hours to get right?\u2019 She\u2019d say: \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s not working!\u2019 This time around, there were nights when we were waiting, looking for her to come in the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cWaiting for her to come in, like,\u201d echoes his brother. \u201cI found that, at night, I was so exhausted. Not physically, but mentally; those months from when Dolores passed away were intense.\u201d\n\nWhen she first sang, I wondered how and why she wasn\u2019t already in a band. I didn\u2019t want to question our luck Noel Hogan\n\nThe pair, along with drummer Fergal Lawler, are a close-knit circle, managed by one of O\u2019Riordan\u2019s five brothers. She grew up 10 miles out of Limerick in Ballybricken, but they are from the town and met when breakdancing in their teens in the mid-80s. They first saw Dolores when she was 19 and tried out for their band; she was painfully shy and quiet, they all agree, but \u201cwhen she sang\u201d, says Noel, \u201cI wondered how and why she wasn\u2019t already in a band. I didn\u2019t want to question it. We were lucky enough that she had come into this room.\u201d\n\nWhile the four of them shared a love for the Smiths and the Cure, O\u2019Riordan\u2019s vocal style stood alone: it was described by a Melody Maker journalist in 1991 as \u201cthe voice of a saint trapped in a glass harp\u201d. She learned her yodel from her dad, a country music fan, and there were church influences, too. The music mag went to her family home to meet the band and painted an intriguing, kitsch picture: a Jesus clock and holy water from Lourdes, with Christmas turkeys being bred in a shed in the dark. She adored her father, a farm labourer who was injured in a motorbike accident that left him unable to work; she is buried alongside him in St Ailbe\u2019s Church, Ballybricken.\n\nClick here to watch the video for the Cranberries\u2019 Zombie.\n\nO\u2019Riordan recalled an idyllic childhood \u2013 warm beds, hearty dinners, a fair dose of spirituality \u2013 but, in 2013, she told the Irish Independent that between the ages of eight and 12 she had been sexually abused by a family friend. Throughout her life she would flip, in interviews, between poetic positivity and confession.\n\nThe heady combination of raw, emotional lyrics and evocative Irish flavours quickly caught the attention of the wider world: the very first song O\u2019Riordan wrote for the band was Linger, and it remains their biggest hit. Although their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?, tanked the first time round, after two US tours Linger was put on heavy rotation by MTV and upon its rerelease the album went to No 1 in the UK. By 1995, it had sold 5m copies in the US. It is being reissued in a box set next month.\n\nDespite their huge commercial success, the Cranberries were never exactly cool in a UK smitten with Britpop; the US was always their second home, where Irish connections were felt so strongly. O\u2019Riordan wrote an international protest song in Zombie, her response to the IRA bombing that killed two children, Jonathan Ball and Tim Parry, in Warrington in 1993. Its lyric was so powerfully abstract that Parry\u2019s father, Colin, only realised, on O\u2019Riordan\u2019s death, what had inspired it. Their label was wary of the track\u2019s politics, but the band were not.\n\nNoel, Mike, Dolores and Fergal at an Irish music awards in 2002. Photograph: Paul McErlane/Reuters\n\n\u201cIn the 30 years with Dolores, what she wanted to do lyrically was her thing; we never interfered,\u201d says Noel. \u201cThat first album was all about relationships that she\u2019d had through her teenage years, and to stand there and spurt that out to everyone, you could open yourself to ridicule \u2013 but she didn\u2019t care. That remained with her always. She wrote what she felt was right.\u201d\n\nWhen fame hit, they were all about 20. It was always tougher for Dolores, says Mike, being on the front of the local paper, buying fish fingers at the supermarket. She broke her leg badly on a group ski trip during the recording of their second album \u2013 she wrote songs from her hospital bed \u2013 and, during her protracted convalescence, she began to struggle with depression and anorexia. By 1999, she was listed as the fifth-richest woman in the British Isles, but fame was wrecking her nervous system. By 2003, the band were \u201cburned out\u201d: they saw very little of each other for six years, with O\u2019Riordan living in Canada with her husband, Don Burton, and their three young children. There was a reunion in 2009, but you get the sense of a band kept on their toes by an unpredictable leader.\n\nShe always said she found it hard to write songs when she was happy. Put a bit of misery in her life and it was easier Noel Hogan\n\n\u201cShe would say we needed some time off and a week later she would be bored,\u201d says Noel. \u201cHer emails were like text messages. Fifteen of them, but they\u2019re all like two lines, at two o\u2019clock in the morning \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes when you did want time off you\u2019d be dreading seeing her ringing,\u201d his brother smiles.\n\nAfter her split from Burton, she spent a period living in hotels in New York. In 2014, she had a manic, paranoid episode on a flight from JFK to Shannon and assaulted the cabin crew, reminding them who she was. Shortly afterwards, she invited the Irish journalist Barry Egan into her home and told him how much trouble she was in; it was a cry for help from someone who had grown up in the public eye and who possibly struggled in periods of relative obscurity. \u201cMy life has no control,\u201d she said. Shortly afterwards, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. How much did the band know about her problems in her later years?\n\n\u201cIt was only the last few years that she started talking about psychological problems, because she didn\u2019t know herself,\u201d says Lawler. \u201cShe saw a few different therapists and realised what she had and she started getting treatment for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was a lot more herself,\u201d says Noel. \u201cEspecially last year, when we were rehearsing: you wouldn\u2019t even know, because they had found the right cocktail of whatever it was she needed to be on. There wasn\u2019t even a case of having to \u2018work around it\u2019. The hardest thing was her back, because playing live she could not move as freely as she used to.\u201d The new album gave her something to focus on, he says. \u201cShe was really psyched about getting back out and really looking forward to China, because that was a big tour for us.\n\n\u201cDolores had an awful lot going on and she was on a roll of being able to write,\u201d he continues. \u201cLyrically, the new album is very strong. She always said she found it hard to write songs when she was happy. She always said: put a bit of misery in her life and it was easier.\n\n\u201cWe will do this album and then that will be it,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere is no need to continue.\u201d\n\nThe band step out on to the balcony to do the photoshoot. Noel stood out here with O\u2019Riordan the last time he saw her. This is new for them: no frontwoman, no idea how to stand, to pose, without their focal point.\n\n\u201cWith Dolores, doing pictures was so easy, because you knew exactly what to do,\u201d he smiles. \u201cJust all get behind her.\u201d\n\nThe box set of Everyone Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? is released on 19 October on UMC.

Written by O\u2019Riordan following the deaths of two young boys during a 1993 IRA-linked bombing attack in England, the singer was adamant that \u201cZombie\u201d needed to be heavier and the music had to be angrier, denser, and electric.\n\n\u201cLittle did we know that it would become the monster that it did,\u201d says Hogan.\n\nNow, 26 years after their \u201cmonster\u201d was released, \u201cZombie\u201d has surpassed one billion views on YouTube, and part of the legacy of The Cranberries second release, 1994\u2019s No Need to Argue, still resonates today.\n\n\u201cSome days it seems like yesterday and then other times it seems like \u2018yea, that was a long time ago,'\u201d says Lawler. \u201cLooking back at that, you\u2019re like \u2018Jesus, we were so young,\u2019 but I remember it all that time.\u201d\n\nHonoring that pivotal album, the band\u2019s history, and O\u2019Riordan, who passed away unexpectedly in January of 2018, the band continued putting the finishing touches on a remaster of No Need to Argue, following the release of their final album In the End, featuring previously recorded vocals by O\u2019Riordan, in 2019.\n\nThe Deluxe edition of No Need to Argue features B-sides, live performances and other extras, including \u201cI Don\u2019t Need,\u201d \u201cAway,\u201d and \u201cSo Cold in Ireland,\u201d all pulled from the original No Need to Argue demo tapes, along with 19 previously unreleased tracks like \u201cYesterday\u2019s Gone\u201d from The Cranberries\u2019 1995 \u201cMTV Unplugged\u201d performance and \u201cSerious,\u201d a song that has lived primarily in bootleg form on YouTube for years.\n\nSeveral additional tracks were also pulled from the band\u2019s 1994 performance at Liverpool Royal Court and a 1995 National Stadium show in Milton Keynes. Spanning 36 tracks, different variations of \u201cZombie\u201d resurfaced, including The Orb\u2019s dub-reggae \u201cCamel\u2019s Hump\u201d remix and a captivating version of \u201cZombie\u201d from Milton Keynes. A new video for No Need to Argue\u2018s \u201cDaffodil Lament\u201d was also released featuring footage from the album\u2019s recording sessions in Oxford, England.\n\nThough several tracks were recorded in New York City at the The Magic Shop and London\u2019s Townhouse Studios, when thinking back to the band\u2019s time recording a majority of the album at The Manor in Oxford, what Lawler remembers most is how much they all laughed. \u201cIt was this big, old manor house,\u201d he says, \u201cand we were having a ball, because we were in our early 20s and just really enjoying ourselves.\u201d\n\nReturning to work with In the End producer Stephen Street, who also produced the band\u2019s 1993 debut Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? and No Need to Argue, along with Wake Up and Smell the Coffee (2001) and 2012\u2032 Roses, Hogan says there was some healing in releasing their last album, but O\u2019Riordan\u2019s absence is still too fresh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still fresh for all of us, but time definitely helps with all of this stuff,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cWe\u2019re particularly proud of that release and that we managed to finish it. I think it was a nice way to do a lovely last Cranberries album. We all believed from the start that it was probably one of the strongest albums that we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nHogan adds, \u201cWe just consider ourselves lucky that Dolores left these vocals behind that we could work with. Doing it at the time was hard, because it wasn\u2019t that long after Dolores passed away. It was Stephen\u2019s [Street] idea to do it while that emotion was still fresh with everybody, and I think that does come across in the album.\u201d\n\nAt the moment there are no plans to release any additional material as they\u2019re taking each project as it comes along. \u201cWe\u2019re not even really sure what is out there, but it\u2019s lovely to hear because you tend not to listen to your own music as time goes by,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cYou record an album, and you play it to death the first few months, go off touring and then stop listening to it. Then when something like this comes around, you listen to it again for the first time in nearly 20 years.\u201d\n\nReleasing the Milton Keynes and Magic Shop demo of No Need to Argue\u2018s \u201cRidiculous Thoughts\u201d was special since that song evolved more than any other for the band live.\n\n\u201cThe live version and the recorded version or two different beasts all together,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cRecorded, it\u2019s quite calm, whereas the live version was probably one of the highlights for us every night. It\u2019s a huge song live, so it\u2019s really hard to compare it to the recorded version. It keeps it interesting for us to play it and see where you can take a song over time.\u201d\n\nInitially, The Cranberries started working on the remaster of the album two years ago with Universal, following the 25th anniversary reissue of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? in 2018. \u201cEven before they released the first one, they started talking about this one,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cOf course, we were delighted at the chance to remaster our album, and to relook at it in today\u2019s kind of sound was great. Then it takes so long to find all the other pieces, because we each probably have bits at home and Universal had stuff in their archives.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries (Photo: Andy Earl)\n\nIn revisiting the songs, the band also perused old photographs taken by Andy Earl, who worked on most of the band\u2019s album artwork through 2017\u2019s Something Else.\n\n\u201cWhen you get the artwork and see things that you\u2019d forgotten about, old photos that weren\u2019t used at the time, it\u2019s a trip down memory lane,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cBut it\u2019s really nice since we all have great memories of that time.\u201d\n\nWhen thinking what Dolores would have thought of the remaster, Hogan and Lawler believe she would have liked all of it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very lucky over the years that we tend to agree on most things,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cWhen we\u2019d record x number of songs for an album, we never really kind of had a big argument about what should or shouldn\u2019t go on it. We were always on the same page, so I\u2019d like to think that even with this, we\u2019d still be on the same page. It\u2019s always harder to pick the ones that aren\u2019t going to make it, than the ones that do, because they\u2019re all your baby in a certain way, and you don\u2019t want to be throwing anything away.\u201d\n\nBoth chipping away at individual side projects, Lawler and Hogan say they\u2019re open to releasing more Cranberries material from the archives and want to continue piecing together the band\u2019s documentary, which they started working on prior to Dolores\u2019 passing, once the pandemic eases up. For now, No Need to Argue is having its moment once again.\n\n\u201cThe songs really come from the heart,\u201d says Lawler. \u201cYou can really feel the emotion in them, and people can relate to that. And when you put on the album now, it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s from the \u201990s. It sounds relevant today. It\u2019s hard to put your finger on it, but I think you can feel the emotion from it. You know that it\u2019s honest songs. They\u2019re written from the heart.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.musicweek.com/publishing/read/primary-wave-acquires-songwriting-catalogue-of-cranberries-noel-hogan/078637", "page_content": "Primary Wave acquires songwriting catalogue of Cranberries' Noel Hogan\n\nPrimary Wave has acquired a majority stake in the music publishing catalogue of Noel Hogan, co-songwriter and lead guitarist for The Cranberries, Music Week can reveal.\n\nThe deal includes some of the group\u2019s biggest hits, such as Linger, Salvation, Dreams and Ode to My Family, as well as a number of songs on the band\u2019s final album In The End.\n\nIn The End is nominated for Best Rock Album at this year\u2019s Grammy Awards.

On the 12th, the Cranberries frontwoman and her longtime bandmate, guitarist Noel Hogan, spoke by phone about a March tour and starting their first studio album in six years. \u201cShe was great,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cWe spoke about getting back to work.\u201d Two days later, O\u2019Riordan e-mailed him several fresh songs that would be considered for that next band album.\n\nSadly, those plans never came to be. On the morning of January 15th, O\u2019Riordan was found dead in a London hotel room. She was 46. At press time, the results of an autopsy and toxicology report had not been announced, and police were treating the death as unexplained but not suspicious. (The coroner\u2019s investigation has been adjourned until April 3 \u201cas they await the results of further tests,\u201d according to that office.) The news marked the shocking end for a singer whose steely, siren-like voice and lyrics about both the personal and the political made her one of the most potent stars of the alt-rock era. As U2 said in a group comment, \u201cShe had such strength of conviction, yet she could speak to the fragility in all of us.\u201d\n\nBorn in 1971, O\u2019Riordan was raised near the Irish city of Limerick, the youngest of seven. She idolized her dad, a farm laborer who was injured in a bike accident that prevented him from working. But a degree of darkness overshadowed her early life. At one point, her sister accidentally burned down the family home. Later, Dolores said that as a child she had been sexually molested by an older man. As O\u2019Riordan told Rolling Stone in 1995, \u201cI have a lot of secrets about my childhood.\u201d\n\nMusic became her escape. In grade school, her voice stood out: \u201cIf I started to sing, then all the others in the room would stop and listen,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. In 1990, she met a local band, the Cranberry Saw Us, and replaced the departing lead singer. Thankfully, they were rechristened the Cranberries. \u201cDolores came and sang a few songs she had written,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cWe were blown away that this small girl from Limerick had such an amazing voice. The fact that she wasn\u2019t already in a band was a miracle.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nInitially, O\u2019Riordan was a shy performer, even singing with her back to the audience. \u201cThere was no big act,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cI think [that] resonated with people.\u201d Despite their newness, the Cranberries were swept up in the Nineties alt-rock major-label bidding fever. Their 1993 debut, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?, begat crashing-wave hits like \u201cLinger\u201d and \u201cDreams,\u201d powered by the blend of the band\u2019s guitar shimmer and O\u2019Riordan\u2019s luxurious, haunted voice. That album and its 1994 follow-up, No Need to Argue, sold millions of records, and the Cranberries even taped an MTV Unplugged.\n\nAccording\n\nto former manager Allen Kovac, O\u2019Riordan intentionally decided to set her band\n\napart with politically urgent lyrics; she wrote its biggest hit, 1994\u2019s \u201cZombie,\u201d\n\nabout two children killed during a 1993 bombing in England by the Irish\n\nRepublican Army. Kovac says Island Records urged them not to release it as a\n\nsingle. (In his telling, she ripped up a $1 million check the label offered her\n\nto work on another song.) \u201cDolores was a very small, fragile person, but\n\nvery opinionated,\u201d says Kovac \u201cHer belief was that she was an\n\ninternational artist and she wanted to break the rest of the world, and \u2018Zombie\u2019\n\nwas part of that evolution. She felt the need to expand beyond \u2018I love you, you\n\nlove me\u2019 and write about what was happening in Ireland at the time.\u201d\n\nIn the summer of 1994, O\u2019Riordan married Don Burton, a tour manager of Duran Duran; the couple eventually moved to his native Canada and had three kids. But she and the Cranberries soon hit a rough patch. \u201cDolores gave so much of herself at the gigs,\u201d says Stephen Street, who produced their first two albums. \u201cPerhaps she could have tempered her behavior and been more measured, but that wasn\u2019t her way.\u201d A 1996 tour was cut short while she dealt with exhaustion. \u201cI had to fly to Ireland and take her to a doctor,\u201d Kovac says. \u201cHe said to her, \u2018You\u2019re not healthy enough to tour.\u2019 My belief was you had to deal with those issues, but I don\u2019t think she ever got through.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries never again repeated their early level of success \u2014 their 2001 album Wake Up and Smell the Coffee peaked at 45 \u2014 but even as their sound grew edgier and punkier, they never lost their fan base, for whom the troubled O\u2019Riordan remained a relatable pop star. The Cranberries\u2019 music remained in demand, used in soundtracks from The Sopranos and Gossip Girl to You\u2019ve Got Mail. (A sample of \u201cZombie\u201d threads through \u201cIn Your Head\u201d on Eminem\u2019s new Revival.) As Hogan says, \u201cThere are songs I hear today that we wrote over 20 years ago and I see and hear people singing along with them.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nWhen the Cranberries broke up in 2003, O\u2019Riordan recorded two under-the-radar solo albums, and the Cranberries regrouped in 2009, eventually releasing one of their strongest albums, Roses, three years later. But O\u2019Riordan\u2019s life remained chaotic. She later claimed she tried to overdose on pills in 2012 and had a drinking problem. Her marriage ended in 2014, the same year she was arrested for stepping on the foot of a flight attendant and head-butting a police officer; a judge spared her from jail after determining she was mentally ill at the time. (\u201cYou can\u2019t arrest me \u2014 I\u2019m an icon!\u201d she yelled at the police.) She was subsequently diagnosed as bipolar. \u201cDolores had a lot of things going on in her life over the past 10 years \u2014 good and bad,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cBut what made Dolores connect with people was her honesty. What you saw was what you got.\u201d\n\n\u201cDolores was so disappointed when we had to cancel the last tour \u2026 She did everything in her power to fix the back problem but it persisted and won in the end.\u201d \u2013 Cranberries co-founder Noel Hogan\n\nAgain, O\u2019Riordan powered through it all with music. With the end of her marriage, she moved to New York and began working with a new band, D.A.R.K., featuring former Smiths bassist Andy Rourke (who calls her talent \u201cbreathtaking\u201d) and DJ Ol\u00e9 Koretsky, who eventually became her life partner. The band\u2019s 2016 debut, Science Agrees, took O\u2019Riordan\u2019s voice into new, electronica areas. But she never fully abandoned the Cranberries, who last year unveiled Something Else, a collection of new and old material played unplugged and orchestrated. In an interview with the BBC to promote it, O\u2019Riordan admitted, \u201cI\u2019ve had health issues the last few years.\u201d Those problems \u2013 specifically back pain from years of playing guitar for so many years \u2013 led to a canceled tour. \u201cDolores was so disappointed when we had to cancel the last tour,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cShe did everything in her power to fix the back problem but it persisted and won in the end.\u201d\n\nThe day before she died, O\u2019Riordan flew to London (one source says she flew from New York to Dublin, where she stayed for a short while before continuing on to London). There, work again beckoned. She was planning to meet with Youth about the second, near-completed D.A.R.K. album, and she was also carving out time to add her vocals to a new version of \u201cZombie\u201d by the L.A. metal band Bad Wolves.\n\nAfter midnight on January 15th, O\u2019Riordan left two voicemail messages for Dan Waite, a label executive who had set up the collaboration with Bad Wolves (and who had worked with the Cranberries in the early 2000s). In her messages, O\u2019Riordan talked lovingly about her kids, expressed their thrill at the Eminem sample and sang a snippet of the Verve\u2019s \u201cBitter Sweet Symphony\u201d (which Youth had produced). \u201cShe was in a good space,\u201d says Waite. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a few things saying she was depressed but she was definitely making plans for the week\u201d \u2014 including, he says, dinner with him and his wife.\n\nInstead, O\u2019Riordan will be buried today in Limerick.\n\nDolores O\u2019Riordan was the lead singer of hits like \u201cLinger\u201d and \u201cZombie\u201d with the Irish band the Cranberries.

It is curated by deputy editor Stuart Clark, who has known the band since their early days.\n\nThe group, known for 1990s hits such as \"Zombie\" and \"Linger\", went on to become Ireland's best-selling rock band after U2, selling more than 40 million records.\n\nO'Riordan drowned in a London hotel bath in January 2018 due to alcohol intoxication. The group disbanded in 2019.\n\nReuters spoke to guitarist Noel Hogan about the book, which can be pre-purchased in one of two editions, including a hardback copy signed by band members and O'Riordan's mother.\n\nBelow are excerpts of the conversation, edited for length and clarity:\n\nQ: What is the book about?\n\n[1/5] A handout photo shows a cover design of a book, \"WHY CAN'T WE? \u2013 The Story Of The Cranberries and the band's iconic frontwoman Dolores O'Riordan\", curated by deputy editor Stuart Clark, featuring interviews as well as previously unseen pictures. Courtesy of Hot Press/Handout via REUTERS\n\nHogan: \"We know Stuart from way back ... We live here in Limerick and he was a local DJ on a pirate radio station when we started out so Stuart used to interview us, then he moved to Hot Press and he always covered us. So there's literally, there is about 30 years worth of interviews, photos and so on.\n\n\"We liked the idea (Hot Press were) going to do everything but they wanted us to be part of it.\"\n\nQ: Why do this book now?\n\nHogan: \"Certainly, when they brought it to us, it wasn't something that was ever mentioned, maybe that's what kind of sparked this idea. The other side of it (is) the band obviously up until three years ago were a running entity. So I guess you do something like this when you're finished, more so.\n\n\"It probably didn't seem like right then would be the time, because things are moving along and you would be doing interviews and maybe, if Dolores hadn't passed away, I think the band was going and (it would be) something you could do way off down the road. So, maybe it's the combination of these things that kind of made them think, 'yep'.\"\n\nQ: Did you have specific moments or thoughts when helping put the book together?\n\nHogan: \"It's a bittersweet thing for us because you have amazing memories and you realise, God, we did so much stuff. And then it reminds you again that Dolores isn't here and that the band is finished and you don't have that anymore. But I guess we have learned to live with in time the legacy of the band more now, that it's still appreciated. And, I mean, to have that after all this time, it's a pretty cool thing.
