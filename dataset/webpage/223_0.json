After his father deserted his mother, the family moved in 1920 to Los Angeles. Robinson attended Muir Technical High School, where his athletic feats opened college doors. At Pasadena Junior College and at the University of California at Los Angeles, he won acclaim in basketball, football, and baseball. In 1941, when family financial problems forced him to leave the University of California without a degree, he played professional football. In 1942 he enlisted in the Army and in 1943 was commissioned a second lieutenant. He served as a morale officer, and his opposition to racial discrimination led to a court-martial for insubordination, but he was acquitted.\n\nIn 1944 Robinson began a professional baseball career, playing with the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Major League. His performance in the east-west championship games (1945) interested Branch Rickey, general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, who was scouting black players. A baseball innovator, Rickey knew that civil rights laws would soon end segregation in major league baseball, and he chose Robinson as a test case for integrating the sport. In 1946 Robinson signed a Dodger contract and was assigned to the Montreal team of the International League. Cautioned to prove himself worthy because other black players' futures depended on his success, Robinson maintained a subdued posture. He achieved stardom with the Dodgers, a team he joined in 1947, and in 1949 won the National League's batting championship and its Most Valuable Player Award.\n\nWith the admission of other African Americans to baseball, Robinson began to aggressively advocate more honest integration. His expos\u00e9s of racial prejudice in baseball helped better the lot of black players but also branded him a troublemaker. He retired from the sport in 1956 and went into business. His lifetime batting average of .311 and his leadership prompted sportswriters in 1962 to vote him membership in Baseball's Hall of Fame.\n\nAs a businessman, Robinson fought for increased civil rights and economic opportunity for African Americans. For his civil rights work he received the Spingarn Medal from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1956. He died suddenly on Oct. 24, 1972, in Stamford, Conn.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFive semiautobiographies deal with Robinson's career, of which Carl. T. Rowan with Jackie Robinson, Wait till Next Year: The Life Story of Jackie Robinson (1960), is a candid portrayal. With other sportswriters Robinson coauthored Jackie Robinson: My Own Story (1948); Jackie Robinson (1950); Baseball Has Done It, edited by Charles Dexter (1964); and Breakthrough to the Big League (1965). Rickey's role in Robinson's breakthrough is described in Arthur Mann, Branch Rickey: American in Action (1957), and Branch Rickey, The American Diamond (1965). Richard Bardolph, The Negro Vanguard (1959), places Robinson's contribution in the context of the black civil rights movement, and David Q. Voigt, American Baseball (2 vols., 1966-1970), places him in the general history of baseball. \u25a1"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Curt-Schilling", "page_content": "Curt Schilling, byname of Curtis Montague Schilling, (born November 14, 1966, Anchorage, Alaska, U.S.), American professional baseball player who emerged as a leading pitcher in the 1990s and helped both the Arizona Diamondbacks (2001) and the Boston Red Sox (2004 and 2007) win the World Series.\n\nSchilling was drafted by the Red Sox out of Yavapai Junior College in Prescott, Arizona, and made his major league debut with the Baltimore Orioles in 1988. He was traded to the Houston Astros in 1991 and to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1992. Schilling was primarily a relief pitcher early in his career, but he joined the Phillies starting rotation during his first year with the team and promptly posted a career-low 2.35 earned run average (ERA). The following year he won 16 games and helped the Phillies reach the World Series, which they lost to the Toronto Blue Jays. He was limited by a series of injuries over the next three seasons, but in 1997 he returned to form with 17 wins and a league-leading 319 strikeouts to earn the first of six career All-Star selections. Schilling was traded to the Diamondbacks in 2000, and the following year he teamed with left-hander Randy Johnson to form one of the most imposing pitching duos in baseball. In 2001 Schilling won 22 games and compiled a 2.98 ERA. That year he helped the Diamondbacks upset the New York Yankees to win the World Series. Schilling and Johnson shared Series Most Valuable Player honours.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nIn 2003 Schilling signed with the Red Sox. His 21 wins in 2004 were the most in the league and marked the third time Schilling had posted 20 or more victories in a single season (2001 and 2002). Aided by his pitching, Boston staged a remarkable play-off run in 2004. Schilling helped the Red Sox rally to become the first team in major league history to overcome a three-games-to-none series deficit to defeat the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series (ALCS). His performance in the pivotal ALCS game six, popularly known as the \u201cbloody sock game,\u201d became a part of baseball lore. Having aggravated an ankle injury earlier in the play-offs, Schilling pitched game six shortly after having undergone an experimental surgical procedure that consisted of stapling the tendon in his right ankle to keep it in place. The staples did not hold during the game, and television cameras frequently focused on the growing bloodstain on Schilling\u2019s ankle, but he pitched through the pain and limited the powerful Yankees lineup to four hits and one run over seven innings in a 4\u20132 victory. The Red Sox then proceeded to sweep the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, ending Boston\u2019s 86-year world championship drought. Schilling\u2019s 2005 season was marred by injuries, but in 2006 Schilling became the 14th pitcher in league history to accumulate 3,000 strikeouts and the 3rd to do so before compiling 1,000 walks. Hampered again by injuries, Schilling won only nine games in the 2007 regular season, but his three postseason wins helped the Red Sox capture another World Series championship (a four-game sweep of the Colorado Rockies). After missing the 2008 season because of a shoulder injury, he retired from professional baseball in March 2009.\n\nIn 2006, while still playing with the Red Sox, Schilling\u2014a longtime fan of electronic role-playing games\u2014founded a video-game company, which eventually was named 38 Studios, for the number Schilling wore during the last 16 years of his career. Originally based in Massachusetts, the company relocated to Rhode Island in 2011 after receiving a $75 million loan from the state. When the company defaulted on the loan in May 2012 and subsequently declared bankruptcy, with more than 400 employees losing their jobs, Schilling was accused by some of mismanagement.\n\nSchilling joined the sports network ESPN in 2010, serving as a cohost on in-studio baseball shows and as a colour commentator on games the network broadcast. In 2015 the politically outspoken Schilling was suspended for a month for sharing a Twitter post that compared extremist Muslims to Nazis. The following year he was fired from the network after sharing an anti-transgender post on Facebook. In October 2016 he began hosting a daily online radio program that focused on conservative politics."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christy-Mathewson", "page_content": "Christy Mathewson, in full Christopher Mathewson, also called Matty and Big Six, (born August 12, 1880, Factoryville, Pennsylvania, U.S.\u2014died October 7, 1925, Saranac Lake, New York), American professional baseball player, regarded as one of the greatest pitchers in the history of the game.\n\nMathewson was one of the first \u201ccollege men\u201d to enter the major leagues, having played football and baseball at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. After pitching for teams in various independent leagues during the summers following his freshman and sophomore years, his contract was purchased by the New York Giants of the National League (NL), and Mathewson made his major league debut at age 19 in July 1900. He appeared in only six games during his first season, but he entered the Giants\u2019 starting pitching rotation in 1901, when he placed sixth in the NL in both earned run average (ERA) and wins.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nMathewson won more than 20 games in each of 13 seasons (12 consecutive, 1903\u201314) and 30 or more on four occasions. His landmark season came in 1905, when he won his first pitching Triple Crown by leading the NL in wins (31), ERA (1.28), and strikeouts (206). But Mathewson was even more impressive in the 1905 World Series, in which he pitched three complete-game shutouts, striking out 18 total batters while allowing just one base on balls as the Giants defeated the Philadelphia Athletics in a five-game series. In 1908 he recorded 37 victories (11 of them shutouts), had a 1.43 ERA, and struck out 259 batters to win his second Triple Crown. He also led the league in ERA in 1909, 1911, and 1913, but his skills had eroded by 1916. Realizing that his playing days were numbered, Mathewson requested a trade to the Cincinnati Reds. Although he only pitched one game for the Reds before retiring as a player in 1916, Mathewson served as the team\u2019s manager until 1918.\n\nHe won 373 regular-season games in his career\u2014tying Grover Cleveland Alexander for the third highest total in major league history\u2014while losing only 188. A right-handed thrower and batter, Mathewson was a master of the fadeaway pitch, later called the screwball. Testifying to the pitcher\u2019s exceptional control, a Giants\u2019 catcher said he could \u201ccatch Matty in a rocking chair.\u201d Mathewson was an intelligent, proud, reticent man with great powers of concentration.

He was the last player to hit .400 in Major League Baseball (.406 in 1941).\n\nWilliams was an excellent ballplayer as a child and later led his high school team to the state championships. He batted left-handed but threw right-handed, baseball\u2019s most desirable combination. Williams was signed by a minor league team in the Pacific Coast League, and after several seasons in San Diego and Minneapolis he was brought up to the Red Sox major league team in 1939. He had a fine rookie season with a batting average of .327.\n\nBritannica Quiz Baseball\n\nHis sophomore season in 1940 was more difficult. Although he batted .344 for the year, he was in something of a hitting slump in the early months. The criticism and heckling that arose from the sporting press and the fans soured Williams\u2019s attitude; thus began a career-long feud between Williams and the media and a love-hate relationship with Boston fans. Williams began refusing to acknowledge cheering fans\u2014for the rest of his career he would never again tip his cap to the crowd.\n\nIn 1941 Williams hit for a season average of .406. His battle with the media continued, however. He had requested a draft deferment in 1942 because he was his mother\u2019s sole support. Many other players played baseball instead of enlisting in 1942 (Joe DiMaggio, for example), but the press called Williams\u2019s choice unpatriotic and derided him for it. He decided to enlist in the U.S. Navy and entered active duty in November 1942. In that same year he won the first of two Triple Crowns (in which a player has the best batting average, most home runs, and most runs batted in [RBIs] during a single season).\n\nWilliams missed the baseball seasons of 1943\u201345 training and serving as a Navy flyer, but he saw no combat. Upon his return to baseball in 1946 he had lost none of his skill, hitting .342 in 1946 and in 1947 winning his second Triple Crown. In 1952 he was once again called up for military service, and for most of the \u201952 and \u201953 seasons he served as a pilot during the Korean War, this time in combat. (He batted .400 and .407 respectively for these years, but because he played only 43 games the records are not for complete seasons and therefore are not counted.)\n\nWilliams hit a career total of 521 home runs, even though he lost five prime years of his career to military service. He won the American League batting title in 1958 (at age 40) with a .328 average, the oldest player ever to do so. Concerning his abilities as a hitter, Williams once said, \u201cA man has to have goals\u2014for a day, for a lifetime\u2014and that was mine, to have people say, \u2018There goes Ted Williams, the greatest hitter who ever lived.\u2019\u201d In 1960 he announced that he would retire at the end of the year. During the final home game of the season he hit a home run in his last at bat. The fans cheered and called for him but Williams still refused to come out of the dugout and recognize them (an incident that author John Updike famously described with the line \u201cgods do not answer letters\u201d).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

He left the franchise in 1972, after it had become the Texas Rangers. After his retirement as a manager, he occasionally worked as a batting coach and became a consultant for a line of fishing equipment (he was an avid fisherman).\n\nWilliams was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966. His autobiography, My Turn at Bat, written with John Underwood, was published in 1969. The two men also wrote The Science of Hitting (1971)\u2014in which Williams described his famous swing, which was known for its speed and efficency\u2014and Ted Williams\u2019 Fishing \u201cThe Big Three\u201d: Tarpon, Bonefish, and Atlantic Salmon (1988).

Largely because of his home-run hitting between 1919 and 1935, Ruth became, and perhaps remains to this day, America\u2019s most celebrated athlete.\n\nBaseball offered Ruth an opportunity to escape both poverty and obscurity. While a teenager at St. Mary\u2019s, he achieved local renown for his baseball-playing prowess, and in 1914 Jack Dunn, owner of the local minor-league Baltimore Orioles franchise, signed him to a contract for $600. Ruth obtained the nickname \u201cBabe\u201d when a sportswriter referred to him as one of \u201cDunn\u2019s babes.\u201d For his day, Ruth was a large man; he stood more than six feet tall and weighed more than 200 pounds. Before the end of the 1914 season, his performance as a pitcher was so impressive that Dunn sold Ruth to the American League Boston Red Sox . That same year Ruth met, courted, and wed waitress Helen Woodford.\n\nPart of the aura surrounding Ruth arose from his modest origins. Though the legend that he was an orphan is untrue, Ruth did have a difficult childhood. Both his parents, George Herman Ruth, Sr., and Kate Shamberger Ruth, came from working-class, ethnic (German) families. Ruth, Sr., owned and operated a saloon in a tough neighbourhood on the Baltimore waterfront. Living in rooms above the saloon, the Ruths had eight children, but only George, Jr., the firstborn, and a younger sister survived to adulthood. Since neither his busy father nor his sickly mother had much time for the youngster, George roamed the streets, engaged in petty thievery, chewed tobacco, sometimes got drunk, repeatedly skipped school, and had several run-ins with the law. In 1902 his parents sent him to the St. Mary\u2019s Industrial School for Boys, a Baltimore , Maryland , asylum for incorrigibles and orphans run by the Xaverian Brothers order of the Roman Catholic Church . For the next 10 years Ruth was in and out of St. Mary\u2019s. When his mother died from tuberculosis in 1912, he became a permanent ward of the school.\n\nAt the same time, Ruth exhibited so much hitting clout that, on the days he did not pitch, manager Ed Barrow played him at first base or in the outfield. In an age when home runs were rare, Ruth slammed out 29 in 1919, thereby topping the single-season record of 27 set in 1884 (by Ned Williamson of the Chicago White Stockings ). In 1920 Harry Frazee, the team owner and a producer of Broadway plays who was always short of money, sold Ruth to the New York Yankees for $125,000 plus a personal loan from Yankee owner Jacob Ruppert. While initially reluctant to leave Boston, Ruth signed a two-year contract with the Yankees for $10,000 a year.\n\nRuth soon became the best left-handed pitcher in baseball. Between 1915 and 1919 he won 87 games, yielded a stunning earned run average of only 2.16, won three World Series games (one in 1916 and two in 1918), and, during a streak for scoreless World Series innings, set a record by pitching 292/3 consecutive shutout innings.\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nAs a full-time outfielder with the Yankees, Ruth quickly emerged as the greatest hitter to have ever played the game. Nicknamed by sportswriters the \u201cSultan of Swat,\u201d in his first season with the Yankees in 1920, he shattered his own single-season record by hitting 54 home runs, 25 more than he had hit in 1919. The next season Ruth did even better: he slammed out 59 homers and drove in 170 runs. In 1922 his salary jumped to $52,000, making him by far the highest-paid player in baseball. That summer he and Helen appeared in public with a new daughter, Dorothy, who was apparently the result of one of his many sexual escapades.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn 1922 Ruth\u2019s home run totals dropped to 35, but in 1923\u2014with the opening of the magnificent new Yankee Stadium, dubbed by a sportswriter \u201cThe House That Ruth Built\u201d\u2014he hit 41 home runs, batted .393, and had a record-shattering slugging percentage (total bases divided by at bats) of .764. He continued with a strong season in 1924 when he hit a league-leading 46 home runs, but in 1925, while suffering from an intestinal disorder (thought by many to be syphilis), his offensive production declined sharply. That season, while playing in only 98 games, he hit 25 home runs.\n\nHe also struggled in his private life. Two years earlier he had met and fallen in love with actress Claire Hodgson, and in 1925 he legally separated from Helen. Helen\u2019s death from a fire in 1929 freed him to marry Hodgson the same year. The couple then formally adopted Dorothy, and Ruth adopted Hodgson\u2019s daughter, Julia.\n\nOn the field during the 1926 season, Ruth returned to his old form. Indeed, in the 1926\u201332 seasons Ruth in his offensive output towered over all other players in the game. For those seven seasons he averaged 49 home runs per season, batted in 151 runs, and had a batting average of .353 while taking the Yankees to four league pennants and three World Series championships. In 1927 Ruth\u2019s salary leapt to $70,000. That season he hit 60 home runs, a record that remained unbroken until Roger Maris hit 61 in 1961 (see also Researcher\u2019s Note: Baseball\u2019s problematic single-season home run record). That same season Ruth teamed with Lou Gehrig to form the greatest home-run hitting duo in baseball. Ruth and Gehrig were the heart of the 1927 Yankees team\u2014nicknamed Murderer\u2019s Row\u2014which is regarded by many baseball experts as the greatest team to ever play the game.\n\nThe 1932 World Series revealed not only Ruth\u2019s flair for exploiting the moment but produced his famous \u201ccalled shot\u201d home run. In the third game of the series against Chicago, while being heckled by the Cubs bench, Ruth, according to a story whose accuracy remains in doubt to this day, responded by pointing his finger to the centre-field bleachers. On the very next pitch, Ruth hit the ball precisely into that spot. After 1932 Ruth\u2019s playing skills rapidly diminished. Increasingly corpulent and slowed by age, his offensive numbers dropped sharply in both 1933 and 1934. He wanted to manage the Yankees, but Ruppert, the team\u2019s owner, is reported to have said that Ruth could not control his own behaviour, let alone that of the other players, and so refused to offer him the post. Hoping eventually to become a manager, in 1935 Ruth joined the Boston Braves as a player and assistant manager. But the offer to manage a big-league team never came. Ruth finished his career that season with 714 home runs, a record that remained unblemished until broken by Henry Aaron in 1974."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roger-Clemens", "page_content": "Roger Clemens, in full William Roger Clemens, (born August 4, 1962, Dayton, Ohio, U.S.), American professional baseball player who was one of the most successful power pitchers in history, thus earning his nickname, \u201cRocket.\u201d He was the first pitcher to win the Cy Young Award seven times.\n\nClemens was raised in Texas and played college baseball for the University of Texas Longhorns before being drafted in 1983 by the Boston Red Sox. After only one year in the minor leagues, Clemens made his major league debut in 1984. In 1986 he had a record of 24 wins and 4 losses with a league-leading earned run average (ERA) of 2.48, and he helped the Red Sox to the American League pennant. He was awarded his first Cy Young Award and was also voted the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP), a rare double honour for a pitcher. Clemens went on to win two additional Cy Young Awards (1987 and 1991) while playing with the Red Sox.\n\nBritannica Quiz Sports Quiz\n\nClemens left Boston to play with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1997 and once again won the Cy Young Award after winning his first career pitching triple crown by leading the AL in wins (21), strikeouts (292), and ERA (2.05). In 1998 he won a second triple crown (with 20 wins, 271 strikeouts, and a 2.65 ERA) to earn his record fifth career Cy Young Award. He was traded to the New York Yankees in 1999 and finally won a World Series championship that season. He had respectable seasons in 1999 and 2000, but he was back in top form in 2001, earning 20 wins and a sixth Cy Young Award. In 2004 he pitched for the Houston Astros, posting 18 wins and earning his seventh Cy Young Award (and his first in the National League). After three seasons with the Astros, Clemens returned to the Yankees in 2007, a year in which he started just 17 games and threw a career-low 68 strikeouts. Although he never officially retired, 2007 was his final season in the major leagues.\n\nClemens twice struck out 20 batters in a single game (in 1986 and 1996\u2014at that time no pitcher had reached this record even once) and passed the 4,000-strikeout mark in 2003, the same year he picked up his 300th career win. Clemens suffered from shoulder problems during the latter stages of his career, but he remained a feared pitcher despite his age and the decreased velocity of his fastball.\n\nIn December 2007 Clemens was prominently mentioned in the report on steroid use in baseball by former U.S. senator George J. Mitchell. In it Clemens was alleged to have taken performance-enhancing drugs during the 1998, 2000, and 2001 baseball seasons; Clemens denied the allegations. In 2010 he was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of perjury and making false statements to Congress for allegedly lying to a U.S. House of Representatives committee in 2008, when he denied having used performance-enhancing drugs. After a mistrial in 2011, Clemens went on trial again the following year and was found not guilty on all charges."}]}
