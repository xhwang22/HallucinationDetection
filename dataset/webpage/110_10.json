I am someone who believes in not airing our dirty laundry in public.\n\n\u201cDespite me being part of the Umno supreme council, no one can point at me and say that I have ever exposed Umno\u2019s flaws to the public.\n\n\u201cI believe in respecting the party and keeping its honour. If the party is in pain, we as housekeepers must provide the cushioning measures.\n\n\u201cWe may have our differences within the party, but we live in the same house. Even when we lost (the Federal Government in 2018), Umno managed to stay intact,\u201d said Reezal.\n\nReezal also called on those who are \u201cexcessive\u201d in their campaigning to tone it down as their actions might not only take down individuals, but also give a bad name to the party.\n\n\u201cThe party is obviously still very much alive, judging from the crowd that is willing to contest all the posts in Umno both at the grassroots and national level.\n\n\u201cI offer myself as a 24-hour housekeeper of the party and I want those who vote for me to look at my record.\n\n\u201cI have been with the party since I was in my 20s and have stuck with the party through thick and thin for more than two decades, rising through the ranks. This shows that I have climbed the political steps and I offer my services. My record is for all to see.\n\nThe nomination period closes on Feb 26.\n\nUmno is in the midst of its internal elections for the 191 divisions and 22,000 branches, including the divisions that were suspended.\n\nThe party\u2019s new office bearers will be elected from Feb 1 to March 18, but the top two positions of president and deputy president will not be contested this time around.\n\nIn May last year, Umno amended its constitution to allow party polls to be held within six months after the conclusion of the 15th General Election.\n\nUmno had postponed its party elections for 18 months after the 2018/2021 term ended on June 30, 2021, which meant party polls for the 2021/2023 term should have been held before Dec 30 last year. However, the polls were postponed."}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2023/03/19/umno-polls-tengku-zafrul-isham-jalil-among-25-elected-to-supreme-council", "page_content": "KUALA
