The win was the fourth in a row for the Cardinals over the Yankees in the best-of-seven World Series.\n\nKurowski\u2019s home run rates with those by players such as Ken Boyer (1964), Tim McCarver (1964), Willie McGee (1982), Tom Lawless (1987), Albert Pujols (2011) and David Freese (2011) as being among the most prominent and most important in Cardinals World Series lore.\n\nBeating the odds\n\nGeorge \u201cWhitey\u201d Kurowski, a Reading, Pa., native, debuted with the Cardinals on Sept. 23, 1941 _ six days after another Polish-American from Pennsylvania, Stan Musial, played his first game for St. Louis.\n\n\u201cKurowski\u2019s right arm, which flaps in the breeze like a seal\u2019s flipper, is the result of a bone operation, in which a large piece was removed from the forearm,\u201d wrote Tom Meany, a New York-based syndicated columnist. \u201cAs a kid, he fell off a fence and landed on some broken glass. Osteomyelitis was the result and osteomyelitis is no fun for an 8-year-old who can\u2019t even pronounce it.\u201d\n\nDetermined to earn a spot with the 1942 Cardinals, Kurowski was at spring training when he learned his father had died of a heart attack. Kurowski also had lost a brother who died in a coal mining accident.\n\nJimmy Brown opened the 1942 season as the Cardinals\u2019 starting third baseman, with Kurowski in reserve. In late May, manager Billy Southworth shifted Brown to second base, replacing Frank \u201cCreepy\u201d Crespi, and made Kurowski the starter at third.\n\nKurowski, 24, batted .254 with nine home runs and 42 RBI in 115 games for the 1942 National League champions.\n\nDecision time\n\nIn Game 1 of the 1942 World Series, Kurowski struck out three times against Yankees starter and future Hall of Famer Red Ruffing.\n\nKurowski produced a hit in each of the next three games, all Cardinals victories.\n\nNeeding one more win to clinch the championship, the Cardinals started rookie Johnny Beazley, winner of Game 2, against Ruffing in Game 5. Ruffing, 37, had seven World Series wins in his career.\n\nIn the ninth, with the score tied at 2-2, Walker Cooper led off for the Cardinals with a single to center. Johnny Hopp\u2019s sacrifice bunt moved Cooper to second.\n\nKurowski batted next. With first base open, Ruffing looked to the dugout to see whether Yankees manager Joe McCarthy wanted him to give an intentional walk to Kurowski. On deck was the eighth-place batter, Marty Marion, who had no home runs during the regular season. After Marion came the pitcher, Beazley.\n\nMcCarthy ordered Ruffing to pitch to Kurowski.\n\nDramatic ninth\n\nKurowski connected on a high, inside pitch and drove the ball through a fog toward the left-field corner. \u201cNot one-tenth of the spectators saw the ball,\u201d wrote Tom Meany.\n\nThe ball _ fair by about five feet _ cleared the fence for a two-run home run, giving the Cardinals a 4-2 lead.\n\nCooper and Kurowski \u201creceived a few pats on the back when they arrived at the bench,\u201d the St. Louis Star-Times reported. \u201cThe Cards were not going to celebrate before the final verdict had been sealed.\u201d\n\nThe Yankees threatened in their half of the ninth. Joe Gordon led off with a single. Bill Dickey rolled a grounder to second, but Jimmy Brown booted the ball for an error.\n\nWith runners on first and second, no outs, Jerry Priddy bluffed a bunt. The Cardinals\u2019 catcher, Walker Cooper, fired the ball _ \u201ca lightning peg,\u201d The Sporting News called it _ to Marion, who was covering second. Gordon, caught off guard, was tagged out.\n\nThe pickoff took the steam out of the Yankees\u2019 comeback hopes. Priddy popped out (Brown made a sprawling catch on the play) and George Selkirk, batting for Ruffing, grounded out, ending the game and clinching the championship for the Cardinals. Boxscore\n\nTeam player\n\nIn the victorious clubhouse, Cardinals players \u201chugged and pounded Kurowski on the back and then hoisted him on their shoulders,\u201d the Associated Press reported. Teammates tore pieces off the back of Kurowski\u2019s uniform pants and kept the shreds as souvenirs.\n\n\u201cI hope my brother, Ray, was listening to the radio,\u201d Kurowski said. \u201cHe\u2019s a Marine down in Parris Island, S.C. I got a letter from him congratulating me on getting into the World Series, but telling me I made him look silly by fanning my first three times at-bat. I got even with him today.\u201d\n\nEach member of the Cardinals earned a World Series championship share of $6,192.50.\n\nUpon arriving in St. Louis by train from New York, the Cardinals were greeted by a crowd so thick on the station platform \u201cit was hard to see who was coming out of the train,\u201d the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nSoon after, 13 of the Cardinals, including Kurowski, went to the Red Cross headquarters in St. Louis and donated blood for use in treating U.S. military members.\n\nWrote the Star-Times, \u201cThe team spirit that carried the Cardinals to the top of the heap can be best illustrated by Kurowski, the blonde-haired Polish boy from the hills of Pennsylvania who sidesteps all personal glory _ even after that epic smash.\u201d\n\nPreviously: From Les Bell to David Freese: Cards 3rd base champs\n\nPreviously: Tom Lawless and his role in Cards World Series lore"}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=kurowwh01", "page_content": "Whitey Kurowski was born on Friday, April 19, 1918, in Reading, Pennsylvania.

He was 81.\n\nKurowski, who lived in Shillington, had been in failing health since suffering a stroke after heart bypass surgery in July, according to his wife, Joan.\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 5, 1942, a remarkable stretch of World Series success for the Yankees came to an end with one swing by a rookie infielder. George (Whitey) Kurowski's two-run home run off Red Ruffing into the left-field stands at Yankee Stadium in the ninth inning of Game 5 propelled the Cardinals to a 4-2 victory and a Series title, the first time the Yankees had been beaten in nine trips to the Series since they were defeated by the Cards in 1926.\n\nThat Kurowski was even in a major league uniform defied the odds. When he was growing up in Reading, Pa., he fell off a fence and landed in broken glass, severely cutting his right arm. Two years later, he began suffering severe pain and was found to have developed osteomyelitis, a bone inflammation. Three inches of bone above his wrist were surgically removed, leaving the arm weakened and with an unnatural bend. He strengthened his arm muscles as he embarked on a baseball career, but his right arm, his throwing arm, had become shorter than his left."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8391/george-john-kurowski", "page_content": "Your suggestions have been submitted and will be reviewed by the memorial manager.\n\nYour edit did not contain any changes from the original.\n\nThank you!
