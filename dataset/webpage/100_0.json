It is not the first time.\n\nIn 2016, then Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Tathagata Satpathy moved a Private Member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha to decriminalise defamation \u2014 the Protection of Speech and Reputation Bill (commonly known as the \u201cSpeech Bill\u201d). Satpathy, who is now the editor of Odia daily Dharitri, speaks to The Indian Express about what prompted him to introduce the Bill, its features, the response of other parties, and the effect criminal defamation has in today\u2019s political climate. Excerpts:\n\nAs an editor, I had about 87 defamation cases filed against me. In Odisha, you have a law that women don\u2019t have to deposit money if they want to file a defamation case. Normally, if you want to file a defamation case you have to deposit a certain percentage of what you claim in court. What happens if you level an allegation or publish a story against the police officials and bureaucrats in the newspapers is that they will get their wives or mothers or sisters to file a case against you. Even if you have enough evidence against them, they will file. Eventually, you will get cleared \u2014 in my case, I won all the cases if not in the lower court, then in the higher court. But it\u2019s harassment.\n\nSo, partly, my Bill was driven by my personal experiences. Because two proceedings, civil and criminal, for the same offence do not seem justified to me. If you look at the global picture, the criminal aspect of the defamation case is not there in any democratic country. The last one I know that had it was Australia but they also removed it a few years ago. In most countries, it\u2019s only the civil part. My simple counter was how can we prosecute twice for the same offence?\n\nI sought the help of lawyers and others, including journalists. Apar Gupta was one of the lawyers who played a key role in drafting that Bill. I may have read the Bill at least 100 times before I went ahead with it. Apar then suggested it would be good if we could put it up for public review, which we did. We had a website \u2014 speechbill.in \u2014 and sought people\u2019s views also. We received a lot of feedback.\n\nWhat were the features of the Bill?\n\nThe main feature of the Bill was that it decriminalised defamation and treated it as a civil offence. It had provisions to curb the chilling effects of criminal defamation and had provisions to prevent damage to reputations. It had quantification of damages for defamation, fixed the maximum amount of damages, and barred governments and institutions exercising government or statutory functions from filing defamation suits.\n\nHow relevant is it in the wake of recent political events?\n\nI did not foresee such an event. I always thought that it is very wrong. Today, everyone seems to have woken up. At the time, the Congress did not support my Bill, no one backed me. But, I wanted to put it on record for posterity at least. I would not say it was a watertight Bill. It needed improvement. But I would like MPs to take it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing an editor, and an active politician not so long ago, what do you think of the position that the right to reputation is no less important a right than the right to freedom of speech?\n\nRight to reputation is a debatable point and that can never ever infringe on freedom of speech or freedom of expression. A statement or a post or a tweet can be said to be hurting someone\u2019s sense and sensibilities. We are seeing it across the country. Then, it is up to them, not to the defendant, to prove how their reputation has been hurt. It\u2019s in the legal process also that during the cross-examination the complainant has to prove how \u2026 but all they can do is to find one or two witnesses in their neighbourhood to say \u2018yes, we thought bad of her or him because of the remark\u2019.\n\nThere are instances of people in power using the defamation law. Do you think it is being used to silence people?\n\nYes, people in power become super touchy. Some people say vulgar things but defend those by claiming freedom of speech. When someone calls me leftist or presstitute or sickular, I get offended. I am very badly hurt because I do not consider myself as someone selling his pen, I consider myself to be neither secular nor Leftist. Yes, I consider myself a liberal, I agree. I was in the House (Lok Sabha) when a Minister of State uttered the word \u2018Presstitute\u2019 on the floor of the House. As an editor and a working journalist, I was hurt. We knew that nothing will come of it. Yes, the same people use defamation clauses against others.\n\nAnother thing is that our lower judiciary is not trained to handle so many issues that come up with something like defamation. They are not normal criminal cases but are hypothetical ones. Our lower judiciary is not equipped to handle them. We talk of judicial reforms and the law minister is constantly talking against the collegium. But they are talking about the Supreme Court that they are dealing with every day. But the common Indian does not get to reach the Supreme Court. They are penalised, prosecuted, sentenced, jailed, given life terms, and the appeals take years. Some die in prisons. I would say 99 per cent of our population even. The high courts seem very high. People can afford to go to only the lower courts. I do not think the lower courts can sit in judgment on such delicate issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you come across instances of defamation clauses being used against political rivals?\n\nI have never experienced (it), at least not in Odisha. But, of course, it comes up against the media. Of late, it has been happening. They are managing to corner opponents that way. The number of defamation cases was much lower 15-20 years back. Either people were gentler or they were not so touchy. If you start taking one line out of a speech, it can work any which way.\n\nYou are an editor. Does the new trend make you think twice before criticising someone powerful even if it\u2019s based on fact? Do you think there is increasing fear among citizens about criticising someone or exposing corruption?\n\nYes, people across India today are much more careful about what they say, especially about politics and politicians. Also about big business. All the powerful people.\n\nYou too?\n\nI am a don\u2019t-care-a-hoot kind of person but I refrain from being abusive. I speak what I like and also write what I think is correct. Also, must admit I have personally not felt fear or threatened, as yet."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/tathagata-satapathy/", "page_content": "Tathagata Satpathy (born 1 April 1956) was a member of the 12th , 14th, 15th and 16th Lok Sabha of India. He represented the Dhenkanal constituency of Odisha, and was re-elected for the fourth time in 2014. He was a member of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) political party, and the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha. He took voluntary retirement from politics in March 2019. He is not an active politician ever since.\n\nLife and work\n\nTathagata Satpathy is the younger son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy and Devendra Satpathy. He is the owner and editor of the daily Odia newspaper, Dharitri, and the English daily, Orissa Post.\n\nIn 2000, Satpathy joined the Orissa Gana Parishad ( a non political outfit), and served as its secretary general. After Naveen Patnaik got elected in 2000, Satpathy had used his newspaper Dharitri to criticise his policies which he does even now. In March 2004, just before the 2004 Indian general election, Satpathy reconciled with BJD. He said that he was forced to quit OGP due its changing into a political party as also forming an alliance with Janaki Ballabh Patnaik-led Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nHis nephew Suparno Satpathy had unsuccessfully contested him in 2014 for the office of MP Lok Sabha, Dhenkanal.\n\nIn March 2015, Tathagata Satpathy became the first Indian Member of Parliament to hold an official \"Ask Me Anything\" session on the content-sharing website Reddit. In April, Satpathy came forward in support of net neutrality, after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) come out with a consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services. In December 2015, Satpathy had supported a bill to decriminalise homosexuality. The bill was introduced by INC leader Shashi Tharoor. But, it was defeated with 71 against, 1 abstaining and 24 in favour.\n\nViews and opinions\n\nOn net neutrality\n\nIn March 2014, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released a formal consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services and whether telecom operators should be allowed to charge separately for some messaging apps. Soon afterwards, Tathagata Satpathy wrote an open letter to TRAI stating his support for net neutrality. In the letter, he said such a policy would hinder the Digital India project and kill new startups. He said that he used such apps to interact with his constituency and this policy will hinder his functioning as a representative.\n\nOn legalisation of cannabis\n\nTathagata Satpathy has criticised the ban on cannabis in India, while pointing out the long history of its usage as a ritual and recreational intoxicant. He has said that cannabis was banned in India while alcohol was not, because of \"an elitist bias\" as cannabis was a poor man's drug. He has said the addiction depends on person's character and not on the intoxicant. He has suggested an amendment to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 to allow recreational and medicinal usage of marijuana. During his \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit in March 2015, Satpathy admitted that he smoked cannabis when he was young. In August 2015, during the monsoon session of the Parliament, he proposed the decriminalisation of cannabis. In December 2015, he repeated his proposal during the winter session, saying that banning cannabis has forced villagers to turn to alcohol.\n\nOn homosexuality and moral policing\n\nTathagata Satpathy has condemned the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises homosexuality in India, calling it \"archaic\" and called for its repeal. He had supported a bill introduced by INC MP Shashi Tharoor to decriminalise homosexuality during the 2015 winter session of the Parliament. When the bill was defeated, Satpathy called it a very sad day. Satpathy has also condemned moral policing and called for a repeal of laws banning pornography in India.\n\nOn privacy and Aadhaar\n\nTathagata Satpathy has raised concerns that the Aadhaar project could be used for mass surveillance or ethnic cleansing in the future. He has questioned why a new identity card project was created despite having several identity cards systems. He has also criticised the decision to present the Aadhaar Bill, 2016 as a money bill. He pointed out that although the bill allows the sharing of biometric under circumstances of national security, there was no concrete definition of national security included in the bill.\n\nOn religious laws and missionaries\n\nSatpathy supports the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code in India. He has criticised those current laws which are based on various religions, saying that the world is moving beyond religious scriptures and such laws only divide the society. He has also said that a lot of faith-based foreign aid comes to Odisha through missionaries. They offer the poor Dalits free education and jobs, this results in mass conversions to Christianity. Satpathy has said that politicians should use the dictionary definition of secularism to avoid confusion.\n\nOther opinions\n\nSatpathy has supported the inclusion of Members of Parliament under the Jan Lokpal Bill to curb corruption. In December 2015, he criticised the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 during a debate, saying that the government was favouring big corporations with such laws. He has also criticised the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana calling it flawed and that it looks good only on paper. He said it forces him to choose only 8 villages from his constituency for development out of 3000. Satpathy has opposed the proposal to make Hindi the national language.\n\nSatpathy has criticised the construction of new nuclear power plants in India, claiming that most of the world was now moving away from nuclear energy. He has also claimed that Areva nuclear firm of France sold outdated technology to Maharashtra. He has also said that the centre should release the data regarding the safety of nuclear power plants as they are in other countries."}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Tathagata_Satpathy", "page_content": "Indian politician\n\nTathagata Satpathy (born 1 April 1956) was a member of the 12th, 14th, 15th and 16th Lok Sabha of India.

Campaigners for a free internet have argued that these companies are trying to clamp down on the internet\u2019s transparency and freedom. While India does not have an existing legislation for net neutrality, TRAI has come up with a consultation paper that seeks views of the public on the matter.

However, BJD sources said Satpathy was trying to get a BJP ticket for his wife Adyasha for Dhenkanal Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nBorn to politician parents (father Debendra Satpahy was two time MP and mother Nandini was Union minister as well as CM) and educated in Puducherry\u2019s Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education, he seemed to be well-set for a career in politics, but did not achieve any success initially. Known to be brash, Tathagata during the emergency days allegedly called shots in Odisha administration taking advantage of his mother\u2019s position as CM.\n\nIt was in 1990, when Tathagat had tasted his first political success after he joined Janata Dal in 1989 under Biju Patnaik and was elected from Dhenkanal Sadar assembly constituency. To secure her son\u2019s career, Nandini moved to neighbouring Gondia seat, from where she won on a Congress ticket. In 1998, he was elected to Lok Sabha for the first time from Dhenkanal, but suffered a defeat in 1999 general election at the hands of KP Singh Deo.\n\nA year later he quit BJD to join Bijoy Mohapatra\u2019s nascent Odisha Gana Parishad where he was secretary general. When he realised that his political career was going nowhere with OGP, he quit to join BJD a month before the 2004 Lok Sabha election. Since then he has never lost from Dhenkanal.\n\nSatpathy is better known in Odisha as editor of Dharitri, now among the top three Odia dailies.

It is not the first time.\n\nIn 2016, then Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Tathagata Satpathy moved a Private Member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha to decriminalise defamation \u2014 the Protection of Speech and Reputation Bill (commonly known as the \u201cSpeech Bill\u201d). Satpathy, who is now the editor of Odia daily Dharitri, speaks to The Indian Express about what prompted him to introduce the Bill, its features, the response of other parties, and the effect criminal defamation has in today\u2019s political climate. Excerpts:\n\nAs an editor, I had about 87 defamation cases filed against me. In Odisha, you have a law that women don\u2019t have to deposit money if they want to file a defamation case. Normally, if you want to file a defamation case you have to deposit a certain percentage of what you claim in court. What happens if you level an allegation or publish a story against the police officials and bureaucrats in the newspapers is that they will get their wives or mothers or sisters to file a case against you. Even if you have enough evidence against them, they will file. Eventually, you will get cleared \u2014 in my case, I won all the cases if not in the lower court, then in the higher court. But it\u2019s harassment.\n\nSo, partly, my Bill was driven by my personal experiences. Because two proceedings, civil and criminal, for the same offence do not seem justified to me. If you look at the global picture, the criminal aspect of the defamation case is not there in any democratic country. The last one I know that had it was Australia but they also removed it a few years ago. In most countries, it\u2019s only the civil part. My simple counter was how can we prosecute twice for the same offence?\n\nI sought the help of lawyers and others, including journalists. Apar Gupta was one of the lawyers who played a key role in drafting that Bill. I may have read the Bill at least 100 times before I went ahead with it. Apar then suggested it would be good if we could put it up for public review, which we did. We had a website \u2014 speechbill.in \u2014 and sought people\u2019s views also. We received a lot of feedback.\n\nWhat were the features of the Bill?\n\nThe main feature of the Bill was that it decriminalised defamation and treated it as a civil offence. It had provisions to curb the chilling effects of criminal defamation and had provisions to prevent damage to reputations. It had quantification of damages for defamation, fixed the maximum amount of damages, and barred governments and institutions exercising government or statutory functions from filing defamation suits.\n\nHow relevant is it in the wake of recent political events?\n\nI did not foresee such an event. I always thought that it is very wrong. Today, everyone seems to have woken up. At the time, the Congress did not support my Bill, no one backed me. But, I wanted to put it on record for posterity at least. I would not say it was a watertight Bill. It needed improvement. But I would like MPs to take it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing an editor, and an active politician not so long ago, what do you think of the position that the right to reputation is no less important a right than the right to freedom of speech?\n\nRight to reputation is a debatable point and that can never ever infringe on freedom of speech or freedom of expression. A statement or a post or a tweet can be said to be hurting someone\u2019s sense and sensibilities. We are seeing it across the country. Then, it is up to them, not to the defendant, to prove how their reputation has been hurt. It\u2019s in the legal process also that during the cross-examination the complainant has to prove how \u2026 but all they can do is to find one or two witnesses in their neighbourhood to say \u2018yes, we thought bad of her or him because of the remark\u2019.\n\nThere are instances of people in power using the defamation law. Do you think it is being used to silence people?\n\nYes, people in power become super touchy. Some people say vulgar things but defend those by claiming freedom of speech. When someone calls me leftist or presstitute or sickular, I get offended. I am very badly hurt because I do not consider myself as someone selling his pen, I consider myself to be neither secular nor Leftist. Yes, I consider myself a liberal, I agree. I was in the House (Lok Sabha) when a Minister of State uttered the word \u2018Presstitute\u2019 on the floor of the House. As an editor and a working journalist, I was hurt. We knew that nothing will come of it. Yes, the same people use defamation clauses against others.\n\nAnother thing is that our lower judiciary is not trained to handle so many issues that come up with something like defamation. They are not normal criminal cases but are hypothetical ones. Our lower judiciary is not equipped to handle them. We talk of judicial reforms and the law minister is constantly talking against the collegium. But they are talking about the Supreme Court that they are dealing with every day. But the common Indian does not get to reach the Supreme Court. They are penalised, prosecuted, sentenced, jailed, given life terms, and the appeals take years. Some die in prisons. I would say 99 per cent of our population even. The high courts seem very high. People can afford to go to only the lower courts. I do not think the lower courts can sit in judgment on such delicate issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you come across instances of defamation clauses being used against political rivals?\n\nI have never experienced (it), at least not in Odisha. But, of course, it comes up against the media. Of late, it has been happening. They are managing to corner opponents that way. The number of defamation cases was much lower 15-20 years back. Either people were gentler or they were not so touchy. If you start taking one line out of a speech, it can work any which way.\n\nYou are an editor. Does the new trend make you think twice before criticising someone powerful even if it\u2019s based on fact? Do you think there is increasing fear among citizens about criticising someone or exposing corruption?\n\nYes, people across India today are much more careful about what they say, especially about politics and politicians. Also about big business. All the powerful people.\n\nYou too?\n\nI am a don\u2019t-care-a-hoot kind of person but I refrain from being abusive. I speak what I like and also write what I think is correct. Also, must admit I have personally not felt fear or threatened, as yet."}, {"url": "https://tathagatasatpathy.com/site/Biography", "page_content": "Biography :\n\nCurriculum Vitae\n\nTathagata Satpathy\n\nDOB: April 01, 1956 at Cuttack, Orissa, India\n\nEducation\n\nEducated at Sri Aurobindo Center of Education, Pondicherry, South India.\n\nSubjects studied English, Philosophy and French\n\nCan speak English, Oriya, Hindi, French\n\nOccupation\n\nJournalism & Publishing Editor Dharitri, published from Bhubaneswar and Sambalpur\n\nDharitri is the first Oriya daily to have an online presence.\n\nThe newspaper is 16 paged with a reach of 12,50,000 readers and has local, national and international news along with views that promote thoughts of a free and liberal world order\n\nElected Representative\n\nHas been a Member of:\n\nOrissa Legislative Assembly (1990-95)\n\nOrissa Legislative Assembly (1990-95) 12th Lok Sabha (1998-99)\n\n(1998-99) 14th Lok Sabha (2004-09)\n\n(2004-09) 15th Lok Sabha (2009-14)\n\n(2009-14) 16th Lok Sabha (2014-present)\n\n(2014-present) Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology\n\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Coal & Steel\n\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Privileges\n\nOther positions held\n\nMember of Marine Product Export Development Authority, India (MPEDA)\n\nPresident of Chacrateertha Bikash Parishad, Puri, Orissa: an organization focused on creating public awareness on the importance of environment protection and waste management\n\nWorking President Akhshyam Kalyan Samiti, Dhenkanal, Orissa: a voluntary organization aiding poor physically challenged children.

It was obvious even to our founding fathers that the \u201cHouse of People\u201d (Lok Sabha) can fall prey to passionate rhetoric and thus felt a need for a \u201cHouse of Elders\u201d (Rajya Sabha) to instil calm. The powers of the Upper House to delay and oppose legislation passed by the Lower House were recognised and enshrined right from the very birth of the Rajya Sabha. It can be nobody\u2019s case that today\u2019s Lok Sabha MPs are any less vulnerable to passing laws in the spur of the moment than our founding fathers were. So, to argue that the Rajya Sabha is being obstructionist for merely opposing legislation of the Lower House is a flawed argument.\n\nNext is this false narrative of indirectly elected members of the Rajya Sabha having veto powers over the members of the Lok Sabha who are direct representatives of the people. In our first-past-the-post electoral system where a political party can form a government without the majority of citizens voting for it, legislation passed by the Lok Sabha may not necessarily represent the views of the majority. The percentage of seats won in the Lok Sabha by a political party is not the same as percentage of Indians voting for that party, as we all know. It then becomes even more pertinent and critical to have an active and vibrant Rajya Sabha.\n\nThat the Rajya Sabha would an indirectly elected body and would act as a balance to certain whimsical legislation of the people\u2019s representatives in the Lok Sabha was a conscious design of our founding fathers. If anything, this need has only been exacerbated with creeping majoritarianism in the current Lok Sabha. It is thus futile to argue that somehow directly elected representatives are better lawmakers than those indirectly elected, and hence should be subordinate. The inability to build consensus by a ruling party cannot be disguised as opposition obstruction and elicit calls for reducing the powers of the Rajya Sabha. The need to build consensus in both Houses of Parliament to pass legislation should be the guiding principle of our parliamentary democracy.\n\nThen, there is the argument that the Anti-Defection Act, which immediately disqualifies any member of Parliament who either changes political parties mid-way or disobeys the whip of her party, aggravates the chances of a dysfunctional Parliament. The core principle behind the Anti-Defection Act is to prevent horse-trading on the floor of the House and penalise members who succumb to temptations from opposition parties. This principle still remains very relevant for a large, diverse polity such as ours, with a large number of regional parties. The Lok Sabha recently held a discussion on a private member\u2019s bill to de-criminalise certain Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. There was no whip issued by the major parties and members voted according to their choices, many times contrary to their party colleagues. The choice of when to issue a whip rests with the party. The Anti-Defection Act in itself cannot be made a villain for an internal matter of political parties over degrees of freedom to be given to their members for voting in Parliament.\n\nScope for reform All this is not to suggest everything is hunky-dory with our current system. There is clearly a need for new rules to prevent productivity of the entire House being held hostage by a few members rushing to the Well. There has to be an outlet for opposition members to voice their protests without disrupting productivity. One suggestion is to have designated day(s) in a week on which the opposition can raise, discuss and debate issues rather than the government dictating the order of business every day of the session. There can be innovative ways to create a framework within which the right to protest is not taken away but is done constructively. But to argue that the construct of the Upper House and the Anti-Defection Act need to be amended or done away with lends credence to our founding fathers\u2019 fears of lawmaking in a fit of frenzy.\n\n(Tathagata Satpathy is a member of Parliament and Chief Whip of the Biju Janata Dal in the Lok Sabha.

The senior BJD leader, who is the party's chief whip in Lok Sabha, reinitiated his demand in the Lower House, wheeling away from the official position of his party.\n\n\"Cannabis is a drug that has been given a bad name, the alcohol lobby, peddling something far more dangerous, has managed to club cannabis with more dangerous narcotics,\" Satpathy had told The Hindu.\n\nBefore a Supreme Court of India (SC) verdict decriminalising homosexuality in September 2018, Satpathy was one of the few MPs who had batted for it. He had said that some socially relevant laws \"need a re-look\" and \"repealing\".\n\n\"I would give an example of something like Section 377, the law relating to a small section of society. But it has a relevance to a particular kind of people who are human beings, who have feelings like us, but their sexual needs are different from a lot of people we know,\" Satpathy had said. He is also against the ban on pornography, reasoning that with changing times, laws should also change in order to change the societal outlook.\n\nThe son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy, Tathagata entered politics during the 1980s, but tasted his first electoral success as a legislator in 1990. Satpathy had then contested on Janata Dal ticket, led by his current boss, Naveen Patnaik's father Biju Patnaik.\n\nThe MP later jumped to Odisha Gana Parishad (OGP) before switching back to the BJD during the 2004 general elections. He is the owner and Editor of Odiya daily Dharitri and English daily Orissa Post and had spoken in favour of net neutrality and the Jan Lokpal Bill.\n\nSatpathy has continued to remain in news for his comments. During the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Hyderabad University row, where leaders from both the spectrum were involved in mud-slinging, Satpathy's speech on the issue was praised by many as balanced.\n\n\"I am heartbroken to say that the youth of the country does not deserve us. We are the most undeserving set of people to be in this House today,\" the BJD leader had said in Lok Sabha, underlining a need to find solutions to the problems and keep the issue out of politics.\n\nThe MP, who is a member of Standing Committee on Coal and Steel, has 92 percent attendance in the lower house, according to PRS Legislative Research data and has participated in debates on Aadhaar Bill, Triple Talaq Bill and a discussion on sustainable development goals.\n\nHe quit politics on the insistence of his 13-year-old son, according to a report by Hindustan Times.

This startling advocacy was certainly not the official position of his party.\n\n\u201cI feel in these socially conservative times, somebody is needed to bell the cat,\u201d Mr. Satpathy told The Hindu . \u201cCannabis is a drug that has been given a bad name, the alcohol lobby, peddling something far more dangerous, has managed to club cannabis with more dangerous narcotics,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNot only legalisation of cannabis, I\u2019m in favour of decriminalising Section 377 [criminalises gay sex] of the Indian Penal Code, and against the ban on pornography,\u201d Mr. Satpathy said, adding that he was making common cause with young people, and that as representatives of a very young population \u201cwe cannot be mundane and outdated\u201d. He said his party has allowed him the freedom to raise issues which he considers important.\n\nChampioning Tamil Another MP with a cause, BJP\u2019s Rajya Sabha member Tarun Vijay fell foul not of his party high command, but \u201cnorth Indian\u201d colleagues over his >championing of the Tamil language and poet Thiruvalluvar. Mr. Vijay, who is in the process of getting a statue of Thiruvalluvar installed in Haridwar on the banks of the Ganga, said his unlikely championing of this cause had very mundane beginnings.\n\n\u201cIt was during the UPSC agitation, when examination papers were being demanded in Hindi that I realised that north Indians had a disproportionate sense of language chauvinism,\u201d said Mr. Vijay, who hails from Uttarakhand. How many of the MPs finding common cause with agitating students sent their own children to Hindi medium schools, read Hindi literature or even newspapers, he asked. \u201cYou are not preserving Hindi in your States and you want Tamilians to learn Hindi?\u201d Mr. Vijay asked. Since then he has been quite a champion of the Tamil language, leaving his colleagues wondering as to just what he would gain from this.\n\nTransgenders\u2019 rights Another MP facing the same question is Shobha Karandlaje of the BJP who is a co-sponsor of a private member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha on transgender rights, which has already been cleared in the Rajya Sabha. That Bill, the >first private member\u2019s Bill to be passed in any House of Parliament in 40 years, was steered by >Tiruchi N. Siva of the DMK. \u201cEven as Minister in the Karnataka government I initiated several measures for providing identity papers, ration cards, and pension for transgenders, therefore when this Bill was cleared in the Rajya Sabha, it was important to sponsor it,\u201d she said. One of her co-sponsors is Baijayant \u201cJay\u201d Panda of the BJD.\n\nParliament provides time each week for members to move Bills which they sponsor privately away from party lines.

I am here to hear who has a word of solace and point of solution to the problems that the nation is facing today. Is it only votes that matter? Is it just us and them?\"\n\nHis speech went viral on social media with people praising him for taking the matter above politics. This is not the first time that Satpathy has stood out among other parliamentarians. On several other occasions in the past, he has articulated his views on women\u2019s reservation, crimes against women, net neutrality, Section 377 and even legalisation of cannabis.\n\nDuring an AMA (ask me anything) session on Reddit last year, Satpathy admitted that he had smoked cannabis. \u201cWhile in college, I have smoked (and unlike Bill Clinton have inhaled) cannabis many a times. In villages of Orissa, many people openly smoke and, as their representative, I am not entitled to be judgmental.\"\n\nSpeaking to Mint after his speech in Parliament, Satpathy said he speaks his mind, does not fear controversies and believes in change through debate.\n\nThe 59-year-old, also the chief whip of the BJD, is the son of Odisha\u2019s only woman chief minister Nandini Satpathy. He is currently serving his fourth term as a member of the lower house of Parliament. A journalist by profession, Satpathy is the owner and editor of leading Odia daily Dharitri and English daily Orissa Post.\n\n\u201cWe have been harping on rights for far too long.

I see good times ahead.\"\n\nEven during the monsoon session last year, when 25 Congress MPs were suspended, Satpathy spoke up in the lower house and made a strong plea against taking up any legislative business in the absence of MPs from several opposition parties, including Congress.\n\nThough Satpathy does not have a personal Twitter or Facebook account, his office runs a Twitter account on his behalf at @SatpathyLive. \u201cI am more a print media guy. I regret to say that I am not very social media savvy, though I am very social. I love to sit down with my friends and chat,\" he said.\n\nHis attendance record in the current Lok Sabha has been 93% as opposed to an average of 83% for parliamentarians. In the 16th Lok Sabha, he has participated in a total of 34 debates and asked three questions, according to the New Delhi-based PRS Legislative Research.\n\n\u201cParliament is partisan when it comes to giving more time and importance to leaders from parties. Someone like Satpathy would be heard and much more noticed outside Parliament than inside. His is a sane and rational voice. The point that he made on Tuesday about us and them is very critical.

The politician has said he wants to take suggestions from the Reddit community for discussions in parliament. Kumbhkaran's post requesting policy inputs is a step towards this effort.\n\n\"I believe this could prove to be a game changer for public participation in policy,\" Kumbhkaran wrote on Reddit.\n\nSatpathy followed in the footsteps of Ashwin Mahesh of Karnataka's Lok Satta Party, who was the first politician to hold an AMA in April 2013.\n\nSatpathy is in the company of noted individuals like US President Barack Obama, pop star Madonna and Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who fielded questions from the International Space Station.

Campaigners for a free internet have argued that these companies are trying to clamp down on the internet\u2019s transparency and freedom. While India does not have an existing legislation for net neutrality, TRAI has come up with a consultation paper that seeks views of the public on the matter. The debate, which has whipped up enormous intensity in the last few weeks, is supported by online petitions like this one on change.org which has already garnered more than 1,00,000 signatures.\n\nIn his letter, Satpathy argues that he uses the internet in different ways, by using messaging apps to keep contact with his staff, using cloud services to prepare documents and video calling to keep in touch with his constituents.\n\n\u201cInternet forms an integral part of how I do my work, therefore I see this move by TRAI as a threat to my functioning as a representative,\u201d the BJD MP writes in his letter.\n\nHe also argues in his letter that charging separately for over-the-top services will be seen as restricting the access to internet.

The Sankha Bhavan is looking great.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no interest to contest in the 2024 elections,\u201d he added.\n\nIt is to be noted here that Tathagata Satpathy was a member of the 12th, 14th, 15th and 16th Lok Sabha. He represented the Dhenkanal constituency and was re-elected for the fourth time in 2014. He was also the Biju Janata Dal\u2019s chief whip in the lower house of the Parliament. He did not contest the 2019 election and had announced not to stay away from politics and work as a journalist. Since then he was not seen in any of the programs of the State ruling party.\n\nHowever, his attendance at the inauguration of the Sankha Bhavan today has now become a subject of discussion in Odisha politics.\n\nSeveral senior politicians and BJD leaders and workers from across the State attended the inauguration of the Sankha Bhavan."}, {"url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/tathagata-satpathy-mp-who-accepted-the-internet-challenge-and-won/story-Mx1ZLZM5Twi3JFwdDXqEZP.html", "page_content": "Lok Sabha member Tathagata Satpathy has gone \"viral\" on the web, not for a foot-in-mouth moment or an absent sense of humour. He won numerous fans by inviting people to \"ask him anything\" on Reddit, the user-generated social media forum, and then took the grilling sportingly. Tathagata-Satpathy-announcing-the-AMA-on-Sunday-Image-via-Imgur\n\nSatpathy participated in a cracker of a Reddit AMA (ask me anything), or a Q&A session, sharing policy insights and talking about smoking cannabis with convincing honesty and a sense of humour over the course of an hour.\n\nThe MP from the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), who represents Dhenkanal constituency of Odisha, was witty from the word go. His very first response earned him brownie points for a reference to Pink Floyd.\n\n\"An MP who gets Floyd references. Why can't you be my MP?\" wrote user Deepit6431.\n\nUser Eepsu asked Satpathy about his party\u2019s take on decriminalising the use of cannabis.\n\nPat came the MP\u2019s reply: \"BJD's election manifesto definitely did not contain anything on cannabis. While in college, I have smoked (and unlike Clinton have inhaled) cannabis many a times. In villages of Orissa, many people openly smoke and, as their representative, I am not entitled to be judgmental.\"\n\nHe added: \"BTW cannabis, luckily, is legal in certain states in India, like Orissa. You can walk up to a government excise shop and buy your day's need.\"\n\n\"Who would have thought a politician impresses Reddit better than a film star (priyanka chopra) or a startup ceo (zomato),\" Reddit user Naive_babes said while praising Satpathy.\n\nIn a smart move, Satpathy disclosed while announcing the Reddit session that his views \u201cshould definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal.\"\n\n\n\nSatpathy is the BJD\u2019s chief whip in the Lok Sabha. The four-time MP is a journalist by profession and the editor of two newspapers, Dharitri (Oriya) and Orissa Post (English).\n\nHis mother Nandini Satpathy served as chief minister of Odisha during 1972-76. His father Devendra Satpathy was a politician and represented the same constituency.\n\nSatpathy was helped by members of his policy team, notably user Kumbhakaran. It was clear that the MP had done his homework to ensure an efficiently coordinated chat.\n\nKumbhkaran too answered questions, cracked jokes and took the discussion forward with a : \"Using Reddit India to get policy inputs for Parliament: Learnings from AMA with /u/tathagatasatpathy\".\n\nOther highlights of the session were its informal natural and Satpathy's well-thought out responses.\n\nThough the AMA session is over, Satpathy is here to stay. The politician has said he wants to take suggestions from the Reddit community for discussions in parliament. Kumbhkaran's post requesting policy inputs is a step towards this effort.\n\n\"I believe this could prove to be a game changer for public participation in policy,\" Kumbhkaran wrote on Reddit.\n\nSatpathy followed in the footsteps of Ashwin Mahesh of Karnataka's Lok Satta Party, who was the first politician to hold an AMA in April 2013.\n\nSatpathy is in the company of noted individuals like US President Barack Obama, pop star Madonna and Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who fielded questions from the International Space Station. Obama's AMA is the highest rated yet and brought down many parts of Reddit due to a spike in traffic to the site."}, {"url": "https://www.livemint.com/Politics/lRYIj61bbQxtJoLuTSW67O/The-business-interests-of-Tathagata-Satpathy.html", "page_content": "Tathagata Satpathy, the journalist and son of former Odisha chief minister Nandini Satpathy is running for re-election from Dhenkanal constituency in Odisha on a Biju Janata Dal ticket.\n\nThe editor of the Oriya daily Dharitri, Satpathy, along with his wife Adyasha controls Dharitri Infotainment Pvt.
