The Adirondack Flames inaugural campaign will begin at the Glens Falls Civic Center in Glens Falls, NY in September of 2014.\n\n\u201cThe Calgary Flames are dedicated to developing players in the American Hockey League, and are excited at the prospect of moving to a mature hockey market like Glens Falls that deserves to remain an AHL market,\u201d noted Calgary Flames General Manager Brad Treliving. \u201cThe history and tradition of the Flames franchise goes back to the team\u2019s birth as the Atlanta Flames and we are proud to also pay tribute to our history with the introduction of a new version of the flaming \u201cA\u201d here in Adirondack. We look forward to building on Glens Falls\u2019 rich hockey history.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference today in Glens Falls, NY, Calgary Flames representatives, including General Manager Brad Treliving, Adirondack Flames President Brian Petrovek, and Glens Falls Mayor John Diamond introduced both the name and the stylized \u201cA\u201d that will ultimately be incorporated into the logo for Adirondack\u2019s team. The main logo for the Adirondack Flames will be a version of the historic flaming \u201cA\u201d which was originally worn by the Atlanta Flames in the 1970s. The home and away jerseys will have the same color and striping pattern as the NHL Flames.\n\n\u201cRetaining the American Hockey League in the region has been our priority for some time\u201d, said Glens Falls Mayor John Diamond. \u201cWe each fondly recall our relationship with the Detroit Red Wings and most recently with the Philadelphia Flyers. Now it is time to welcome and support our new partner in the Calgary Flames and Brian Petrovek who has made it his priority to keep the AHL here in Glens Falls.\u201d\n\nThe Adirondack Flames also launched their ticketing campaign for the 2014-2015 season today. Tickets can be reserved beginning today by going to www.adirondackflames.com or by calling 518-480-3355. Also, fans can start following the Adirondack Flames immediately on Twitter at twitter.com/AHLFlames and on Facebook at facebook.com/AHLFlames.\n\n\u201cI am excited at the prospect of relocating to Glens Falls and dedicating my time to the success of this team\u201d, said Adirondack Flames President Brian Petrovek. \u201cI have worked in the American Hockey League for over fifteen years now and understand that for this venture to succeed it will take work, commitment to this community and the support of hockey fans in this region.\u201d\n\nPetrovek joins the Adirondack Flames as President following 14 years as Managing Owner/CEO for the Portland Pirates. He\u2019s extensive resume of experience in the hockey business also includes senior management positions with USA Hockey; Vice President of Marketing for the New Jersey Devils; and Executive Director for the AHL\u2019s Utica Devils. He has an impressive history of community leadership, participating on several charitable boards and committees including as Board Chair for the United Way of Greater Portland. A graduate of Harvard with a master\u2019s degree, Petrovek was an All-American goaltender with Harvard before being drafted to the NHL by the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nGlens Falls has been home to the American Hockey League for 25 seasons. The Detroit Red Wings AHL development program captured four Calder Cup titles between 1979 and 1999 under the banner of the Adirondack Red Wings and most recently the Philadelphia Flyers (Adirondack Phantoms) made Glens Falls their home in 2009 and left at the conclusion of the 2013-14 season."}, {"url": "https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/264128/brian-petrovek", "page_content": "Edit Mode\n\nGo Premium to enter Edit Mode\n\nTake control of your EliteProspects profile!

From an initial meeting with Larry and Darcy last fall and our follow-up with Chief Operating Officer Dan DiPofi, we knew this would be a great fit for our fans and our business, one that we expect will bring exciting, championship caliber performances on the ice for years to come, along with a deeply rooted commitment to our community off the ice as well. Today\u2019s announcement represents another important building block in our growth and commitment to professional hockey in Maine,\u201d said Petrovek and Bullard in a joint statement.\n\n\n\nBefore teaming up with the Pirates, the Sabres were affiliated with the Rochester Americans for 29 seasons, the longest such partnership in professional hockey between an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. During that span, Rochester had a record of 1,137-932-238-13 in 2,320 regular season games (.593 winning percentage) and made the playoffs 24 out of the 29 seasons. The team won its Division title eight times, advanced to the Calder Cup Finals six times, winning the Calder Cup three of those years in 1983, 1987 and 1996. A number of current Sabres players, including Thomas Vanek, Derek Roy,\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are excited to begin our AHL affiliation with the Portland Pirates and the city of Portland,\u201d said Buffalo Sabres Managing Partner Larry Quinn. \u201cI am looking forward to working with Lyman Bullard, Brian Petrovek and Brian Williams, and the entire Pirates organization. I have been impressed with their professionalism from day one and am excited to build our new relationship both personally and professionally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a rich history of professional hockey in Portland and we hope to add to that winning tradition,\u201d said Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier. \u201cDuring our tenure with our previous AHL affiliation, our franchise model was to draft and to develop young prospects and build our success from a core group within. With our current roster of players like Jason Pominville,\n\n\n\nThe NHL officially came to Buffalo on Dec. 2, 1969, as part of a two-team expansion, when the league awarded Seymour and Northrup Knox the franchise that would soon be named \u201cSabres.\u201d They chose center Gilbert Perreault as their first draft pick in 1970, after being awarded the number one selection. He, along with wingers Rene Robert and Rick Martin, became known as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d and led the Sabres to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1975, only five seasons after the team\u2019s inception. The team had continued success and made the playoffs for the next ten seasons, five of which where under Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman (\u201879-\u201880, \u201881-\u201885). The team experienced great success again in the mid-90s, going through a number of changes in the 1996-97 season. Founder Seymour H. Knox passed away in the spring of 1996 just as the Sabres donned new uniform colors and moved from the storied Memorial Auditorium into the new HSBC Arena where they went on to capture the Northeast Division title. Lindy Ruff, a former Sabres defenseman and left wing, was named head coach at the beginning of the next season and led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals. The team\u2019s success carried over to the 1998-1999 season when the Sabres made the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Dallas Stars in six games.\n\n\n\nTom Golisano brought stability and a renewed excitement to the team when he purchased it in March, 2003. Following the NHL lockout, the Sabres returned to exceed all expectations by recording 52 wins and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, earning Ruff a Jack Adams Trophy for Coach of the Year. The next season proved to be even better, as the Sabres won a franchise-record 53 games and earned the President\u2019s Trophy in front of 41 sell-out crowds in the regular season. They also sold out the nine home playoff games on their way to the Conference Finals, making it the first time since 1979-80 that every game was played in front of a sold-out crowd. This success on and off the ice earned the organization a nomination for \u201cProfessional Sports Team of the Year\u201d from the Sports Business Journal and Sports Business Daily.\n\n\n\nBuffalo becomes the third NHL affiliate in Pirates history. During its five-year affiliation with the Washington Capitals (2000-2005), the Pirates compiled a .535 regular-season winning percentage and made the playoffs three out of the five seasons. During their three-year affiliation with the Anaheim Ducks (2005-2008), the Pirates compiled a .563 regular-season winning percentage and made two Calder Cup playoff appearances, losing in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in both the 2005-06 and 2007-08 seasons. During that time, the Pirates averaged close to 5,000 fans per game and attendance grew by over 15 percent. With their NHL affiliate closer geographically, Portland hopes that its fans will invest in the success of the Sabres and the rivalry between the Boston/Providence Bruins will intensify. Pirates fans will be able to watch the Sabres play divisional opponent Boston six times during the NHL\u2019s regular season, giving fans a closer look at their new NHL affiliate.\n\n\n\nThe new long-term agreement between the Pirates and the Buffalo Sabres guarantees professional hockey in the city of Portland through 2011. Since the Maine Mariners inaugural season in 1977, over 1,000 games have been played in front of over 3 million fans at the American Hockey League level. The AHL is the top development league for the National Hockey League and will be celebrating its 73rd season of play next season. Dating back to the days of the Maine Mariners, the American Hockey League has now played hockey in Portland for over 30 years. Only five other teams (Hershey, Rochester, Providence, Springfield and Cleveland) have had an American Hockey League franchise in their city longer than Portland. The Cumberland County Civic Center, the Pirates\u2019 home, has hosted four Calder Cup Champions in 1978, 1979, 1984 and 1994 and the 2003 Dodge AHL All-Star Classic, one of the most successful in league history. \u201cThis is an exciting day for fans of hockey throughout our state to partner with an eastern US city with one of the richest histories in professional hockey dating back to the turn of the century.

During its five-year affiliation with the Washington Capitals (2000-2005), the Pirates compiled a .535 regular-season winning percentage and made the playoffs three out of the five seasons. During their three-year affiliation with the Anaheim Ducks (2005-2008), the Pirates compiled a .563 regular-season winning percentage and made two Calder Cup playoff appearances, losing in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in both the 2005-06 and 2007-08 seasons. During that time, the Pirates averaged close to 5,000 fans per game and attendance grew by over 15 percent. With their NHL affiliate closer geographically, Portland hopes that its fans will invest in the success of the Sabres and the rivalry between the Boston/Providence Bruins will intensify. Pirates fans will be able to watch the Sabres play divisional opponent Boston six times during the NHL\u2019s regular season, giving fans a closer look at their new NHL affiliate.The new long-term agreement between the Pirates and the Buffalo Sabres guarantees professional hockey in the city of Portland through 2011. Since the Maine Mariners inaugural season in 1977, over 1,000 games have been played in front of over 3 million fans at the American Hockey League level. The AHL is the top development league for the National Hockey League and will be celebrating its 73rd season of play next season. Dating back to the days of the Maine Mariners, the American Hockey League has now played hockey in Portland for over 30 years. Only five other teams (Hershey, Rochester, Providence, Springfield and Cleveland) have had an American Hockey League franchise in their city longer than Portland. The Cumberland County Civic Center, the Pirates\u2019 home, has hosted four Calder Cup Champions in 1978, 1979, 1984 and 1994 and the 2003 Dodge AHL All-Star Classic, one of the most successful in league history.

From an initial meeting with Larry and Darcy last fall and our follow-up with Chief Operating Officer Dan DiPofi, we knew this would be a great fit for our fans and our business, one that we expect will bring exciting, championship caliber performances on the ice for years to come, along with a deeply rooted commitment to our community off the ice as well. Today\u2019s announcement represents another important building block in our growth and commitment to professional hockey in Maine,\u201d said Petrovek and Bullard in a joint statement.\n\n\n\nBefore teaming up with the Pirates, the Sabres were affiliated with the Rochester Americans for 29 seasons, the longest such partnership in professional hockey between an NHL team and its AHL affiliate. During that span, Rochester had a record of 1,137-932-238-13 in 2,320 regular season games (.593 winning percentage) and made the playoffs 24 out of the 29 seasons. The team won its Division title eight times, advanced to the Calder Cup Finals six times, winning the Calder Cup three of those years in 1983, 1987 and 1996. A number of current Sabres players, including Thomas Vanek, Derek Roy,\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are excited to begin our AHL affiliation with the Portland Pirates and the city of Portland,\u201d said Buffalo Sabres Managing Partner Larry Quinn. \u201cI am looking forward to working with Lyman Bullard, Brian Petrovek and Brian Williams, and the entire Pirates organization. I have been impressed with their professionalism from day one and am excited to build our new relationship both personally and professionally.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a rich history of professional hockey in Portland and we hope to add to that winning tradition,\u201d said Sabres General Manager Darcy Regier. \u201cDuring our tenure with our previous AHL affiliation, our franchise model was to draft and to develop young prospects and build our success from a core group within. With our current roster of players like Jason Pominville,\n\n\n\nThe NHL officially came to Buffalo on Dec. 2, 1969, as part of a two-team expansion, when the league awarded Seymour and Northrup Knox the franchise that would soon be named \u201cSabres.\u201d They chose center Gilbert Perreault as their first draft pick in 1970, after being awarded the number one selection. He, along with wingers Rene Robert and Rick Martin, became known as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d and led the Sabres to the Stanley Cup Finals in 1975, only five seasons after the team\u2019s inception. The team had continued success and made the playoffs for the next ten seasons, five of which where under Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman (\u201879-\u201880, \u201881-\u201885). The team experienced great success again in the mid-90s, going through a number of changes in the 1996-97 season. Founder Seymour H. Knox passed away in the spring of 1996 just as the Sabres donned new uniform colors and moved from the storied Memorial Auditorium into the new HSBC Arena where they went on to capture the Northeast Division title. Lindy Ruff, a former Sabres defenseman and left wing, was named head coach at the beginning of the next season and led the team to the Eastern Conference Finals. The team\u2019s success carried over to the 1998-1999 season when the Sabres made the Stanley Cup Finals where they lost to the Dallas Stars in six games.\n\n\n\nTom Golisano brought stability and a renewed excitement to the team when he purchased it in March, 2003. Following the NHL lockout, the Sabres returned to exceed all expectations by recording 52 wins and reaching the Eastern Conference Finals, earning Ruff a Jack Adams Trophy for Coach of the Year. The next season proved to be even better, as the Sabres won a franchise-record 53 games and earned the President\u2019s Trophy in front of 41 sell-out crowds in the regular season. They also sold out the nine home playoff games on their way to the Conference Finals, making it the first time since 1979-80 that every game was played in front of a sold-out crowd.

Bullard remained the majority owner until this winter, when Ron Cain increased his stake in the team and, shortly thereafter, took over CEO duties from Petrovek, who remained president of business development.\n\nChurch said he believes Petrovek retains his ownership stake. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not an owner,\u201d Church said, \u201cso I don\u2019t know for sure.\u201d\n\nCalls to Petrovek, Cain and Bullard were not returned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut in a prepared statement, Petrovek said, \u201cMy decision allows Ron to steer the ship on his own course and begin a new journey for the brand and our fans and sponsors as the team prepares for the 2014-15 season.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Cain thanked Petrovek for his service.\n\n\u201cBrian is at the top of his game,\u201d Cain said. \u201cOur loss will be another\u2019s gain.\u201d\n\nCain lauded Petrovek\u2019s success in attracting the AHL all-star game to Portland in 2003 and 2010 and his involvement in civic and charitable organizations. Petrovek has served on the boards of Maine Medical Center, the United Way of Greater Portland and Portland\u2019s Downtown District.\n\nPetrovek was also the face and voice of the team\u2019s difficult and extended lease negotiations with trustees of the Cumberland County Civic Center in 2003, 2010 and 2013. \u201cWe\u2019ll give it three more years,\u201d he said after grudgingly signing a 2003 agreement. \u201cWe will not play in the building three years from now unless it has been renovated or the economic terms are different.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Petrovek flirted with moving the franchise to Albany, N.Y., before agreeing to a two-year extension. After voters approved a $33 million bond in 2011 to renovate the civic center, its trustees reached an agreement with the Pirates on a one-year lease with an eye toward a longer-term deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a deal, which seemed to be imminent in April 2013, fell apart in August. In September, the team filed a lawsuit and then announced that its entire 38-game home schedule would be played at the Androscoggin Bank Colisee in Lewiston.\n\n\u201cWith any sports team, there\u2019s a certain amount of friction around the guy who\u2019s the face of the organization,\u201d said Chris Hall, CEO of the Portland Regional Chamber of Commerce. \u201cCertainly, the last year and a half has been difficult, but people should reflect on all the good years and the contributions. The city of Portland is well known as a great minor-league sports town. Well, one of the reasons is because of people like Brian Petrovek.\u201d\n\nThe first few months in Lewiston included three sellouts and an average attendance of more than 2,600 fans. The Pirates won a franchise-low 10 \u201chome\u201d games. They ended the season with a 10-game losing streak and an average attendance of 2,185 \u2013 the only one of 30 AHL franchises below 3,000.\n\nA new five-year lease with the civic center was announced in February, after Cain became majority owner and the Pirates dropped their lawsuit against the county-owned facility.\n\n\u201cRon, Lyman and I started talking more definitively about the opportunity and need for change as the ink dried on a new long-term lease with the civic center and the completion of the renovation project,\u201d Petrovek said in his statement.\n\nNeal Pratt, chairman of the civic center\u2019s board of trustees, said he and Petrovek often disagreed, but their relations were never disagreeable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBrian was always a zealous advocate for the team and a tireless promoter of the Pirates brand,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cHe tried to do what was best for his team and his business and I respect that and wish him well.\u201d\n\nPratt said the list of Petrovek\u2019s charitable efforts is impressive.\n\n\u201cHe has done a lot of volunteer work for the community,\u201d Pratt said, \u201cand I think he should be recognized for that.\u201d\n\nIn March 2013, Petrovek pleaded guilty to operating under the influence as part of a deal to avoid jail time after he crashed his Jeep Wrangler into the concrete barrier on Spring Street in Portland. His blood-alcohol content was measured at three times the legal limit for driving.\n\n\u201cWhat his legacy will be, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Church. \u201cMy hope is that people look at the big picture and recognize all the good that has come with his leadership of the organization.\u201d\n\nIn another, unrelated change, the Pirates lost their general manager Monday when Brad Treliving, former assistant GM of their parent NHL club, the Phoenix Coyotes, was hired as GM of the NHL\u2019s Calgary Flames.\n\nGlenn Jordan can be contacted at 791-6425 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: GlennJordanPPH"}, {"url": "https://www.echlthunder.com/en/news/2017/3/calgary-flames-appoint-brian-petrovek-as-stockton-heat-ceo-765", "page_content": "Stockton, CA - The Calgary Flames announced today that they have named Brian Petrovek as Chief Executive Officer of its AHL Stockton Heat Hockey Club.
