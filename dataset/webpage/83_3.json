Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.\n\nWith speeds that can reach over 90 mph, luge is one of the most dangerous sports at the Olympic Games.\n\nAccidents and injuries are common during competition.\n\nTwelve years ago, Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili died before the Opening Ceremony of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics after losing control of his sled on a training run and hitting a steel pole that was unpadded.\n\nThe International Luge Federation conducted an investigation where they determined that human error was the cause of the deadly training run crash. While there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track, it was later redesigned with higher walls and padded beams, now meant to limit speeds to just about 87 miles per hour.\n\nAnd two weeks before the start of the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Polish-born British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski died on the luge track during a practice run.\n\nTeam USA Luger Emily Sweeney discusses her rebound after breaking her neck and how her military service is similar to being in the Olympics.\n\nHow does luge work?\n\nLuge is a one or two-person event where an athlete lies on their back on a flat sled and races down a specially designed ice track.\n\nIf a slider crosses the finish line without his sled, the run is thrown out, which means automatic disqualification since all of the run times count toward the final score. However, the slider can cross the finish line carrying their sled, and the run will still count.\n\nWhat equipment is used in luge?\n\nThe equipment involved is relatively simple. It includes gloves, boots, a helmet and the sled.\n\nThe sled is made from fiberglass and steel and is custom-made for the athlete based on their height and weight.\n\nThe sled rides on two sharp-bottomed blades known as runners, the only part of the sled that makes contact with the ice.\n\nWhat are the different events in luge?\n\nThere are four luge events that take place at the Olympics: men's singles, women singles, mens doubles and mixed team relay event.\n\nThe mixed team relay event was added to the program in 2014.\n\nEach nation is allowed to enter a maximum of three men, three women, two doubles teams and one relay team. No more than 106 luge athletes can participate at the Games.\n\nWhich countries are good at luge?\n\nGermany is the most dominant when it comes to luge.\n\nSince the addition of luge in the 1964 Winter Games, German athletes have won 81 of the 141 medals awarded for it, and 34 of 48 gold medals.\n\nIn the singles events, a German man or woman has taken home 20 out of the 30 combined Olympic titles.\n\nAustria\u2019s Olympic luge team has won the second-most medals (22) and third-most golds (six).\n\nItaly follows behind with 22 total medals and the second-most golds (seven).\n\nWho won gold in luge at the 2018 Winter Olympics?\n\nAustrian David Gleirscher took men\u2019s singles gold in 2018, adding to the country\u2019s legacy in the sport. Austria\u2019s 22 total luge medals are the most in Olympic history for a non-German country.\n\nGerman Natalie Geisenberger is the two-time defending Olympic champion in women\u2019s singles entering Beijing and has continued her dominance in the sport with four world championship medals since the last Winter Olympics."}, {"url": "https://olympics.nbcsports.com/athlete/nodar-kumaritashvili/", "page_content": "Luge is Saba Kumaritashvili\u2018s family business. His great-grandfather is credited with bringing the sport to their homeland, the former Soviet republic of Georgia, more than a half-century ago. His father runs the national federation, as his relatives have for decades.\n\nAt home, his family is synonymous with sliding.\n\nAt the Olympics, his family is synonymous with sadness.\n\nHe qualified for the Beijing Games with hopes of changing that.\n\nIt\u2019s been 12 years since his cousin, Nodar Kumaritashvili, died in a training accident at the Vancouver Games, a death that still haunts the sport, especially so every four years when the Olympics roll around and the memories get rekindled. Nodar was 21 when he would have made his Olympic debut; Saba is 21 now, about to make his Olympic debut.\n\nPut simply, Saba slides for his country. For his family. And for Nodar.\n\n\u201cEvery generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar\u2019s footsteps,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well.\u201d\n\nIt is that strength that got him here, even while he knows that some in his family are nervous whenever he takes the ice because of what happened to his cousin.\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili was killed Feb. 12, 2010, after losing control of his sled during a training run just hours before the Vancouver Games officially opened. He would have raced the next day, becoming the first in his family to compete on sliding\u2019s biggest stage.\n\nHis cousin now has that chance.\n\n\u201cI am happy and proud that I have opportunity to represent my family and country at these Olympics,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili said. \u201cNow I feel responsibility to them, because they expect good results from me. It\u2019s really big motivation, so I will try to do my best for them.\u201d\n\nThat is what Nodar Kumaritashvili was trying to do 12 years ago.\n\nThe crash happened at 10:50 a.m. on a Friday, with most people already turning their attention to the opening ceremony taking place that night. The Whistler, Canada, track has 16 curves, and Nodar Kumaritashvili appeared to lose control around the 13th turn. His 176-pound body was no match for the gravitational forces, which sent him careening along the ice-covered walls of the track. The last impact with one of those walls knocked him off his sled and sent him flying across the track, his arms and legs flailing.\n\nHis body sailed over the wall of the track near the finish line, the back of his head striking a metal post outside of the track. Rescue workers got to him within seconds to no avail. He was pronounced dead after 59 minutes of resuscitation efforts, though a coroner\u2019s report later revealed his head injuries were so traumatic that he died instantly.\n\nHis last recorded speed was 89.4 mph, which almost certainly was the fastest of his career. Some of the world\u2019s best sliders had said that week that the track was too fast and too dangerous; after Nodar Kumaritashvili\u2019s death, Olympic officials made several changes, including having competitors begin from a lower spot on the track in an effort to reduce speeds.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget every detail of that day, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Erin Hamlin, a former women\u2019s luge world champion who competed for the U.S. at the Vancouver Games. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any athlete who raced in Whistler will.\u201d\n\nGerman slider Felix Loch, who won the gold medal in men\u2019s luge at those Olympics, went to Georgia two months later and tearfully presented the Kumaritashvili family with a gold medal of its own \u2013 because Nodar\u2019s death, in Loch\u2019s words, changed the sport. There have been other gifts: paintings, photos, books, even letters from some of the first responders who remain haunted that his life couldn\u2019t be saved. His headstone in Georgia is adorned by a massive bronze sculpture of him on a sled, not far from where his actual sled and the damaged helmet he wore for his last ride are displayed.\n\nSomehow, Saba was never deterred. The family, he decided, had unfinished Olympic business.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals. \u2026 I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe is one of nine athletes from Georgia, and the only one from a sliding sport, to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThat Saba Kumaritashvili could endure the family anguish and still follow his cousin\u2019s path to an Olympics has drawn admiration from other sliders.\n\n\u201cHe saw through the haze,\u201d said former U.S. luge athlete and Olympian Christian Niccum, who competed in the 2010 games. \u201cIt was a terrible accident. An accident. These things happen in life and it\u2019s awful, but we can either live in fear from it or learn from it, grow from it and keep going. That\u2019s why I think he\u2019s an excellent story.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s relationship with luge is believed to go back to at least the early 1970s when Aleko Kumaritashvili \u2013 \u201cmy great-grandfather laid the foundation for this sport,\u201d Saba said \u2013 oversaw the building of a short training track. Soviet officials helped build a more complete track around 1973, and Aleko Kumaritashvili served as the country\u2019s coach.\n\nIt has been part of the family makeup ever since. Saba and Nodar took similar paths to the Olympics; both were introduced to the sport by their family as kids, then got into international sliding and did enough to qualify for the Games despite not having World Cup circuit experience.\n\nSaba insists he is ready.\n\n\u201cI look at his story as what the Olympics are all about,\u201d Niccum said. \u201cIt\u2019s what life is about. It\u2019s what every motivational story there is talks about. It\u2019s perseverance. Forgetting about the past, the fears of the past, the tragedies of the past and looking forward, not living in fear or letting anything slow you down.\u201d\n\nOlympicTalk is on Apple News.

It will draw attention to complaints from other competitors about a facility that has stretched the boundaries of safety in what is already a dangerous sport. \"We are not crash-test dummies,'' an Australian competitor said on Thursday.\n\nYet if these are issues for the lawyers somewhere down the line, more immediate questions may be asked by the Canadians of themselves, who, in pursuit of their own Olympic dream \u2013 30 medals at least, with as many golds as possible \u2013 appear to have forgotten that national \u00adcharacteristic for which they are best known: politeness.\n\n\"Some say what defines us/is something as simple as please and thank you/and as for you're welcome/well we say that too,'' wrote Shane Kozycan in \"We Are More\", a poem he delivered during the opening ceremony.\n\nIn normal times perhaps, but in the run-up to these games, the hosts \u2013 or at least the Canadian Olympic Committee \u2013 seemed to have mislaid their manners. \"Own the podium,\" it implored its athletes in an initiative aimed at ensuring the host nation finishes at the top of the medals table at these games. Money has been poured into training, while a hard-edged approach has been adopted in dealing with other teams, most noticeably in granting them only limited access to facilities such as the sliding track.\n\nSuch behaviour is within the Olympic rules, but it came across as distinctly un-Canadian at the time, and in the context of Friday's death it seemed like a terrible misjudgment. Steven Holcomb of the US bobsleigh team said: \"This track is one of the fastest and most difficult in the world, so I think keeping it closed and not letting people have access\u2026 made it very difficult. Then you have Olympic ice, which is even faster. Little mistakes become big mistakes, and big mistakes end in tragedy.''\n\nKumaritashvili was one of those who had relatively limited experience on the track. He spent a week there in November during training, according to reports, and had gone down the track 26 times in total. He had crashed once, as had the double Olympic champion, Armin Z\u00f6ggeler of Italy.\n\n\"It would be speculation if I said the time period of practice was sufficient or was not,'' said Georgia's minister of sport Nikolos Rurua, before defending the luger against suggestions that he was inexperienced \u2013 or simply not good enough \u2013 to be competing at Olympic level. Rurua said: \"He was a very progressive, strong athlete. It was his wish to compete at the Olympics, and he underwent a rigorous qualifying process. He was 44th in world rankings.\"\n\nYet if the formalities of Olympic diplomacy required the minister to leave it at that, so sparing the feelings of the hosts, Holcomb felt no such compunction. \"They limited the amount of access and training time we had on the track, while they let Canadians train on it as much as they wanted,\" he said. \"There were smaller nations that have never been down here before. It is kind of unfair and now it is a tragedy.'' So much for the Olympic dream."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/winter-olympics-sports-georgia-beijing-canada-b842754aa238d98066d2eeaee33d8dff", "page_content": "FILE - Saba Kumaritashvili of Georgia poses for a photo before speeding down the track during a men's race at the 52th FIL Luge European Championships in Sigulda, Latvia, Thursday, Jan. 7, 2021.

Every four years, the Olympics remind the Kumaritashvili family of the tragedy.\n\n\"My family supports me when they heard that I will participate in the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games.

Thinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well,\" the 21-year-old said.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Saba's great grandfather Aleko Kumaritashvili oversaw the construction of Georgia's first luge training track. And then a more complete track a few years later. Aleko then served as the country's head coach. David Kumaritashvili, the father of Nodar, was a seasoned luger who won the USSR youth championship when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nSaba's father runs the national luge federation, a job his relatives have held for decades. In Georgia, Kumaritashvili almost stands for luge.\n\nIn Nodar's funeral on February 20, 2010, David Kumaritashvili told Xinhua that Nodar phoned home on the day before his crash and in his opinion, the track in whistler was the toughest track. \"I told him to decelerate by touching the surface of the ice with feet -- but he was angry: 'Don't tell me that. You are a luger, lugers do not tell each other to slow down!'\" said David.\n\nThen the accident shocked the world. \"I would say the worst day was when the Georgian luge athlete (Nodar Kumaritashvili) died in Vancouver. This is the worst moment in my Olympic life,\" said Jacques Rogge, the former IOC president.\n\nThe accident changed the sport. After the accident, the starting point of the luge was moved down to reduce speed and a wooden wall was erected atop the curve where Nodar lost his life.\n\nThe designers of the tracks adjusted their styles, making it harder for athletes to reach the speed around 150kph. In the training session of Beijing 2022, even the legendary athlete Felix Loch can only have the highest speed around 130kph.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family didn't stop their dreams chasing progress although suffering heavily from the accident, when in Yanqing, Saba is going to slide for his country, his family, and for Nodar.\n\n\"After a very hard season, my mission of getting into the Olympics had been completed.

Already in Vancouver everybody knew they had to change things on the track for the next Sochi Olympics. The run on the track definitely had to be slowed down.\n\nAs a result, Sochi has got a \u2018roller-coaster-like track\u2019 as reported in the New York Times, which runs more than about 10 kilometers per hour slower than the one in 2010.\n\nAt 21 years of age, Kumaritashvili died without fulfilling his ultimate wish \u2013 becoming an Olympic champion. He was on his final official training run when he lost control at high speed and crashed into a steel pole at 143.3 km per hour.\n\nSo fast, not so good\n\nFour years after Kumaritashvili\u2019s fatal run at the luge track in Vancouver, his friends, family, his country\u2019s government and society have been searching for answers and trying to determine the real reason why the athlete died. Was it a result of driving errors committed by Kumaritashvili(as the International Luge Federation (FIL) report claimed) or was it because of imperfections in the track?\n\nFour years after Kumaritashvili\u2019s death and with a new Olympic competition coming up, friends and family continue to seek answers and action.\n\nThe Olympic bag in Nodar's room, it was sent to Nodar's family after the Games in Vancouver.

The track is slower and features three uphill sections, an unprecedented number of hills. The first two were added to reduce speed and the third, near the end of the track, in order to provide a drastic raise where the track curls over itself. The designers made firm brakes where there speeds are expected to reach 160 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe track in Sochi runs slower than one in Vancouver. Photo by James Hill. See more \"In Pictures\".\n\nBesides the uphill parts, the track has unusual 17 curves which begin with sharp descent or vice versa, dipping away at a sharp angle.\n\nImmediately after Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash, changes were made to the Vancouver Olympic luge track.The FIL made the start of the track lower however explained this change was made to reduce emotional difficulty for the athletes. Following the tragic accident, the luge competition continued on schedule. Meanwhile before Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash, a number of other athletes had also crashed on the luge course.\n\nCase\u2019s not closed\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Minister of Sport Levan Kipiani said the issue cannot be closed until society has no more questions.\n\n\"Yes there is a report by the experts but on the other hand, changes occured at the Vancouver luge track and the start was made lower as well. Besides this, other athletes were seriously injured at the same track before Nodar\u2019s death. Accordingly, since public interest is high towards this case I would not say the case is closed,\u201d Kipiani said.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family are a traditional luging family and Nodar\u2019s father David won the USSR Championship three times. Nodar\u2019s uncle Felix Kumaritashvili is the national luge coach. Photo by N. Alavidze\n\nNodar\u2019s father, David Kumaritashvili who is also a former luger, says his family was sure his son was not to blame for the crash and the tragedy was caused by track imperfections.

He is 21 now, the same age Nomar was when he arrived at the Games for the first time.\n\n\u201cEvery generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar\u2019s footsteps,\u201d Saba Kumaritashvili told The Associated Press last month. \u201cThinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.aol.com/sports/luge-killed-cousin-slid-olympics-135739019.html", "page_content": "YANQING, China \u2014 Nodar Kumaritashvili was four curves away from Georgian Olympic history when, on that chilling day in 2010, he lost control.\n\nOne moment, he was furthering a family legacy, whizzing down a luge track, completing one last training run before the Games.\n\nThe next, he flew off his sled, over an icy wall, and into a metal pole.\n\nHe would\u2019ve been the first Georgian luger to compete at the Olympics. Instead, he died.\n\nNow, 12 years later, his cousin is.\n\nSaba Kumaritashvili thought about Nodar this week, as he prepared to slide down a rock-hard track here in Yanqing. He pulled his hips forward and clenched his lips, then pushed back, and flung himself into this treacherous, frozen strait. He careened around corners, and flirted with walls, and hit 78 miles per hour.\n\nBut he \u201cwasn\u2019t afraid,\u201d he said after his second run.\u201d Tragedy never threatened to drive him away from the sport.\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cafter Nodar, I didn\u2019t want luge to die in Georgia. I wanted to keep it going.\u201d\n\nSo he did what so many members of his family had done for decades. His story, like Nodar\u2019s, is so much more than a crash or a single-minded Olympic pursuit. It begins with his great grandfather, Aleko, who laid the groundwork, literally. Aleko oversaw the construction of Georgia\u2019s first luge track in the 1970s. His son and grandson took advantage. Saba\u2019s grandfather, Felix, slid to the Junior European Championships a few years later. Saba\u2019s uncle \u2014 Nodar\u2019s father \u2014 then won a USSR youth championship in the final years before the Soviet split.

Nodar, he said, was also one of his reasons.\n\nThe cousins were 12 years apart. Saba was 9 in 2010 when Nodar did what so many other family members had dreamed of, and then what every luger fears. Saba doesn\u2019t \u201cremember much of him, only moments.\u201d But enough to have Nodar at the forefront of his mind when he posed with Olympic rings, and walked the Olympic track, and stepped into Friday\u2019s Opening Ceremony.\n\nHis continued participation in luge made some family members apprehensive. But Saba never wavered.\n\nNodar had laid down a path. Saba followed it. Nodar was 21 when he qualified for the 2010 Olympics. Saba was 21 when he did last month, and when he completed his final run here on Sunday, with smile and a shake of his head.\n\nHe did not win a medal. He didn\u2019t come close, finishing 31st of 34 in the men\u2019s singles competition.\n\nBut he was here. He was emotional. He was proud of himself.

While there was no indication that the accident was caused by deficiencies in the track, it was later redesigned with higher walls and padded beams, now meant to limit speeds to just about 87 miles per hour.\n\nAnd two weeks before the start of the 1964 Innsbruck Games, Polish-born British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypeski died on the luge track during a practice run.\n\nTeam USA Luger Emily Sweeney discusses her rebound after breaking her neck and how her military service is similar to being in the Olympics.\n\nHow does luge work?\n\nLuge is a one or two-person event where an athlete lies on their back on a flat sled and races down a specially designed ice track.\n\nIf a slider crosses the finish line without his sled, the run is thrown out, which means automatic disqualification since all of the run times count toward the final score. However, the slider can cross the finish line carrying their sled, and the run will still count.\n\nWhat equipment is used in luge?\n\nThe equipment involved is relatively simple. It includes gloves, boots, a helmet and the sled.\n\nThe sled is made from fiberglass and steel and is custom-made for the athlete based on their height and weight.\n\nThe sled rides on two sharp-bottomed blades known as runners, the only part of the sled that makes contact with the ice.\n\nWhat are the different events in luge?\n\nThere are four luge events that take place at the Olympics: men's singles, women singles, mens doubles and mixed team relay event.\n\nThe mixed team relay event was added to the program in 2014.\n\nEach nation is allowed to enter a maximum of three men, three women, two doubles teams and one relay team. No more than 106 luge athletes can participate at the Games.\n\nWhich countries are good at luge?\n\nGermany is the most dominant when it comes to luge.\n\nSince the addition of luge in the 1964 Winter Games, German athletes have won 81 of the 141 medals awarded for it, and 34 of 48 gold medals.\n\nIn the singles events, a German man or woman has taken home 20 out of the 30 combined Olympic titles.\n\nAustria\u2019s Olympic luge team has won the second-most medals (22) and third-most golds (six).\n\nItaly follows behind with 22 total medals and the second-most golds (seven).\n\nWho won gold in luge at the 2018 Winter Olympics?\n\nAustrian David Gleirscher took men\u2019s singles gold in 2018, adding to the country\u2019s legacy in the sport.

Every four years, the Olympics remind the Kumaritashvili family of the tragedy.\n\n\"My family supports me when they heard that I will participate in the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. I am very happy to be here,\" Saba told Xinhua in a post-training interview.\n\n\"Every generation of our family had at least one luge sportsman, and now my father and I are continuing this tradition and following Nodar's footsteps. Thinking about him is painful but gives me strength as well,\" the 21-year-old said.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Saba's great grandfather Aleko Kumaritashvili oversaw the construction of Georgia's first luge training track. And then a more complete track a few years later. Aleko then served as the country's head coach. David Kumaritashvili, the father of Nodar, was a seasoned luger who won the USSR youth championship when Georgia was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nSaba's father runs the national luge federation, a job his relatives have held for decades. In Georgia, Kumaritashvili almost stands for luge.\n\nIn Nodar's funeral on February 20, 2010, David Kumaritashvili told Xinhua that Nodar phoned home on the day before his crash and in his opinion, the track in whistler was the toughest track. \"I told him to decelerate by touching the surface of the ice with feet -- but he was angry: 'Don't tell me that. You are a luger, lugers do not tell each other to slow down!'\" said David.\n\nThen the accident shocked the world. \"I would say the worst day was when the Georgian luge athlete (Nodar Kumaritashvili) died in Vancouver. This is the worst moment in my Olympic life,\" said Jacques Rogge, the former IOC president.\n\nThe accident changed the sport. After the accident, the starting point of the luge was moved down to reduce speed and a wooden wall was erected atop the curve where Nodar lost his life.\n\nThe designers of the tracks adjusted their styles, making it harder for athletes to reach the speed around 150kph. In the training session of Beijing 2022, even the legendary athlete Felix Loch can only have the highest speed around 130kph.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family didn't stop their dreams chasing progress although suffering heavily from the accident, when in Yanqing, Saba is going to slide for his country, his family, and for Nodar.\n\n\"After a very hard season, my mission of getting into the Olympics had been completed. And think it is a new starting point for me,\" Saba said.\n\n\"My family supports me, they are proud of me,\" the new hope of the family added.

The Whistler, Canada, track has 16 curves, and Nodar Kumaritashvili appeared to lose control around the 13th turn. His 176-pound body was no match for the gravitational forces, which sent him careening along the ice-covered walls of the track. The last impact with one of those walls knocked him off his sled and sent him flying across the track, his arms and legs flailing.\n\nHis body sailed over the wall of the track near the finish line, the back of his head striking a metal post outside of the track. Rescue workers got to him within seconds to no avail. He was pronounced dead after 59 minutes of resuscitation efforts, though a coroner\u2019s report later revealed his head injuries were so traumatic that he died instantly.\n\nHis last recorded speed was 89.4 mph, which almost certainly was the fastest of his career. Some of the world\u2019s best sliders had said that week that the track was too fast and too dangerous; after Nodar Kumaritashvili\u2019s death, Olympic officials made several changes, including having competitors begin from a lower spot on the track in an effort to reduce speeds.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t forget every detail of that day, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Erin Hamlin, a former women\u2019s luge world champion who competed for the U.S. at the Vancouver Games. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think any athlete who raced in Whistler will.\u201d\n\nGerman slider Felix Loch, who won the gold medal in men\u2019s luge at those Olympics, went to Georgia two months later and tearfully presented the Kumaritashvili family with a gold medal of its own \u2013 because Nodar\u2019s death, in Loch\u2019s words, changed the sport. There have been other gifts: paintings, photos, books, even letters from some of the first responders who remain haunted that his life couldn\u2019t be saved. His headstone in Georgia is adorned by a massive bronze sculpture of him on a sled, not far from where his actual sled and the damaged helmet he wore for his last ride are displayed.\n\nSomehow, Saba was never deterred. The family, he decided, had unfinished Olympic business.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals. \u2026 I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe is one of nine athletes from Georgia, and the only one from a sliding sport, to qualify for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nThat Saba Kumaritashvili could endure the family anguish and still follow his cousin\u2019s path to an Olympics has drawn admiration from other sliders.\n\n\u201cHe saw through the haze,\u201d said former U.S. luge athlete and Olympian Christian Niccum, who competed in the 2010 games. \u201cIt was a terrible accident.

Instead, he died.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad ADVERTISEMENT\n\nNow, 12 years later, his cousin is.\n\nSaba Kumaritashvili thought about Nodar this week, as he prepared to slide down a rock-hard track here in Yanqing. He pulled his hips forward and clenched his lips, then pushed back, and flung himself into this treacherous, frozen strait. He careened around corners, and flirted with walls, and hit 78 miles per hour.\n\nBut he \u201cwasn\u2019t afraid,\u201d he said after his second run.\u201d Tragedy never threatened to drive him away from the sport.\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cafter Nodar, I didn\u2019t want luge to die in Georgia. I wanted to keep it going.\u201d\n\nSo he did what so many members of his family had done for decades. His story, like Nodar\u2019s, is so much more than a crash or a single-minded Olympic pursuit. It begins with his great grandfather, Aleko, who laid the groundwork, literally. Aleko oversaw the construction of Georgia\u2019s first luge track in the 1970s. His son and grandson took advantage. Saba\u2019s grandfather, Felix, slid to the Junior European Championships a few years later. Saba\u2019s uncle \u2014 Nodar\u2019s father \u2014 then won a USSR youth championship in the final years before the Soviet split. Multiple family members, including Saba\u2019s father, have run the Georgian luge federation since.\n\nDavid Kumaritashvili, father of the Georgia luger Nodar Kumaritashvili who killed on an Olympic training run, shows a photo his son e-mailed from the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. (AP)\n\nSo luge, naturally, entered Saba\u2019s life at an early age, just as it had Nodar\u2019s. His parents guided him into the sport. \u201cI think they wanted it more than me,\u201d he said. Nodar, he said, was also one of his reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe cousins were 12 years apart. Saba was 9 in 2010 when Nodar did what so many other family members had dreamed of, and then what every luger fears. Saba doesn\u2019t \u201cremember much of him, only moments.\u201d But enough to have Nodar at the forefront of his mind when he posed with Olympic rings, and walked the Olympic track, and stepped into Friday\u2019s Opening Ceremony.\n\nHis continued participation in luge made some family members apprehensive. But Saba never wavered.\n\nNodar had laid down a path. Saba followed it. Nodar was 21 when he qualified for the 2010 Olympics. Saba was 21 when he did last month, and when he completed his final run here on Sunday, with smile and a shake of his head.\n\nHe did not win a medal. He didn\u2019t come close, finishing 31st of 34 in the men\u2019s singles competition.\n\nBut he was here. He was emotional. He was proud of himself. And he was happy.\n\n\u201cVery happy,\u201d he said. \"I\u2019ve done what I needed.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://olympics.nbcsports.com/athlete/nodar-kumaritashvili/", "page_content": "Luge is Saba Kumaritashvili\u2018s family business.

As questions were raised to his [level of] experience, I\u2019d like to inform you that he was from a place in Georgia with long snow sports tradition,\u201d said Mr. Rurua, noting that Kumaritashvili had taken 11th in training yesterday and had been ranked 44th so far on this season's World Cup circuit. \u201cHe was well-qualified, very hard worker in this particular field. Insinuations and speculation about his experience to me seems a little unfair and misleading.\u201d\n\nRurua\u2019s comments underscored concerns that had been voiced all week by Olympians from a range of countries. More than a few athletes had a rough go of training during Friday, adding to the buzz about whether the newest international track had crossed a red line from fast to unsafe.\n\n\"On the first run, I had some problems in the lower portion of the track. Because of the physics of the curves, and going at 95 miles per hour, there's a really small margin for error,\u201d said American Tony Benshoof, who holds the Guinness Book of World Records for the fastest luge speed. \u201cYou really need to get it right from curve nine to get as far as curve 13, because once you get to curve 11 and 12, you're going too fast to correct yourself.\"\n\nEven Armin Z\u00f6eggler of Italy, the top-ranked slider in the world, crashed in training on Friday.\n\nRurua said the Georgian delegation had been promised a quick and thorough investigation of Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash on the last turn of the 16-curve course. Though devastated, the team had decided to press on with their Olympic events \u2013 just as they did when Georgia was invaded by Russia during the opening ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Games.\n\n\u201cOur sportsmen and our athletes decided to be loyal to the spirit of Olympic games and they will compete and dedicate their performance to their teammate,\u201d said Rurua.\n\nA highly nuanced sport\n\nWhile luge is sometimes mocked as taking little effort or skill, it is in fact a highly nuanced sport that demands incredible precision, says Olympic silver medalist Gordy Sheer, who now serves as marketing director for USA Luge.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on a sled going 90-95 m.p.h., inches off the ice, and trying to put the sled within one or two inches of an imaginary line,\u201d explains Sheer. \u201cThere\u2019s a natural urge to look where your line is, but if you lift your head up, your time just evaporates.\u201d\n\nAnd with no suspension system, they have to use their bodies as shock absorbers \u2013 without moving in a way that will make the sled veer.\n\nAll this on runners made to be as dull as possible. While runners can be sharpened to give more control, that\u2019s a luxury few are willing to give themselves in a sport that\u2019s time to the thousandths of a second.\n\nIn sum, luge is about as easy as driving a car with bald tires full speed down a curvy road in a snowstorm and trying to keep the tires exactly on the yellow line \u2013 all while steering with your feet and looking at the ceiling, being able to see only out of the corner of your eye.\n\nSolidarity from international teams\n\nBut while luge athletes are accustomed to handling the unique challenges of \u201cthe fastest sport on ice,\u201d the Whistler track approaches the point of being too dangerous, says five-time Olympian Mark Grimmette of the US team.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re probably getting close,\u201d said Grimmette the night before Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash. \u201cYou definitely have to be on your game from [curve] 11 down. I think that\u2019s definitely something they\u2019re going to have to take into account when they design future tracks.\u201d\n\nGrimmette, whose analytical, even-handed approach helped him become the US flag-bearer for tonight\u2019s opening ceremonies, said tracks don\u2019t have to get faster to be a better test of sliders\u2019 capabilities.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be faster in order to be trickier,\u201d he said, noting that sliders reach only 70-75 m.p.h. on the Lake Placid track, but that a couple of curve combinations make it a hard course. And, he added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be faster to be more exciting.\u201d\n\nBut in press conferences this week, numerous athletes said they really liked this track, including American Erin Hamlin, the reigning world champion, and Meagean Simister of the Canadian team.\n\nSimister\u2019s teammate Alex Gough added that while she gets butterflies at European tracks, the Whistler one feels like home. Others pointed out that the 2006 Olympic track in Cesana, Italy, was controversial at first, but once athletes became accustomed to the course, it became a non-issue.\n\nThe number of runs Canadians have had on their track, compared with the fewer opportunities afforded to other teams under international rules, has raised some concerns and criticism from other countries.\n\nIn the wake of Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash, however, such divisions fell to the background as luge teams from around the world expressed their condolences to the Georgian delegation.\n\n\"USA Luge expresses its deepest sympathies to the family of Nodar Kumaritashvili, his teammates and coaches as well as the entire delegation from Georgia,\" said USA Luge executives Dwight Bell and Ron Rossi in a statement Friday afternoon. \"He will remain in our prayers.\"\n\n________________\n\nCheck out all our Olympics coverage.\n\nChrista trained full time for the Olympics between 1997 and 2002.

They pledged to honor his memory in his native Georgia with a \u201clasting memorial.\u201d\n\nOfficials have placed a premium on safety in the sport since his death. No major crashes have occurred yet at the luge track in Sochi.\n\n\u201cI think the athletes, from what I can gather, are pretty happy with the courses,\u201d International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said. \u201cThey have all talked pretty positively about the courses. It is always an issue. It always will be in winter sports.\u201d\n\nBach joined luge officials for the moment, not far from the track where the Sochi sliding events are taking place. Adams also said flowers will be placed at the track in Whistler, British Columbia, on the track where Kumaritashvili died. It\u2019s an effort to help maintain regular with Kumaritashvili\u2019s family.\n\nFrom the AP:"}, {"url": "https://agenda.ge/en/article/2014/190", "page_content": "If Nodar Kumaritashvili was alive today he would definitely take part in the Sochi Winter Olympics, says the father of the luge athlete who died in a tragic accident hours before the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\nWith his tragic death Nodar Kumaritashvili hurt his family members and friends but meanwhile, changed a lot in the luge sliding sport. Already in Vancouver everybody knew they had to change things on the track for the next Sochi Olympics. The run on the track definitely had to be slowed down.\n\nAs a result, Sochi has got a \u2018roller-coaster-like track\u2019 as reported in the New York Times, which runs more than about 10 kilometers per hour slower than the one in 2010.\n\nAt 21 years of age, Kumaritashvili died without fulfilling his ultimate wish \u2013 becoming an Olympic champion. He was on his final official training run when he lost control at high speed and crashed into a steel pole at 143.3 km per hour.\n\nSo fast, not so good\n\nFour years after Kumaritashvili\u2019s fatal run at the luge track in Vancouver, his friends, family, his country\u2019s government and society have been searching for answers and trying to determine the real reason why the athlete died. Was it a result of driving errors committed by Kumaritashvili(as the International Luge Federation (FIL) report claimed) or was it because of imperfections in the track?\n\nFour years after Kumaritashvili\u2019s death and with a new Olympic competition coming up, friends and family continue to seek answers and action.\n\nThe Olympic bag in Nodar's room, it was sent to Nodar's family after the Games in Vancouver.

See more \"In Pictures\".\n\nAttempts have been made to prevent such a tragedy happening again, as the accident caused Sochi Olympics organisers to rethink the design of the luge track in Sochi. The track is slower and features three uphill sections, an unprecedented number of hills. The first two were added to reduce speed and the third, near the end of the track, in order to provide a drastic raise where the track curls over itself. The designers made firm brakes where there speeds are expected to reach 160 kilometers per hour.\n\nThe track in Sochi runs slower than one in Vancouver. Photo by James Hill. See more \"In Pictures\".\n\nBesides the uphill parts, the track has unusual 17 curves which begin with sharp descent or vice versa, dipping away at a sharp angle.\n\nImmediately after Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash, changes were made to the Vancouver Olympic luge track.The FIL made the start of the track lower however explained this change was made to reduce emotional difficulty for the athletes. Following the tragic accident, the luge competition continued on schedule. Meanwhile before Kumaritashvili\u2019s crash, a number of other athletes had also crashed on the luge course.\n\nCase\u2019s not closed\n\nGeorgia\u2019s Minister of Sport Levan Kipiani said the issue cannot be closed until society has no more questions.\n\n\"Yes there is a report by the experts but on the other hand, changes occured at the Vancouver luge track and the start was made lower as well. Besides this, other athletes were seriously injured at the same track before Nodar\u2019s death. Accordingly, since public interest is high towards this case I would not say the case is closed,\u201d Kipiani said.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family are a traditional luging family and Nodar\u2019s father David won the USSR Championship three times. Nodar\u2019s uncle Felix Kumaritashvili is the national luge coach. Photo by N. Alavidze\n\nNodar\u2019s father, David Kumaritashvili who is also a former luger, says his family was sure his son was not to blame for the crash and the tragedy was caused by track imperfections. This is the same belief of his daughter, Nodar\u2019s younger sister. She says everybody knows, including the FIL, that Nodar was a professional luger and he would not make such a crucial mistake on the track.\n\n\"If he wasn\u2019t a professional or had a lack of experience he would not have undergone the strict qualification process and become an Olympian,\u201d Mari Kumaritashvili says.\n\nChristian Niccum, an American luger who will compete at his third Olympics in Sochi, told the New York Times: \"It\u2019s such a terrible thing to say it\u2019s his fault; it\u2019s so much easier to say it\u2019s someone else\u2019s fault or the track\u2019s fault. But in the end, he\u2019s the one on that sled.\u201d\n\nCanadian Olympic luger Regan Lauscher wrote an article for the Calgary Herald stating Kumaritashvili\u2019s death was about as probable as \"getting hit by lightning.\"\n\n\"We race our unarmored bodies down ice tracks with no brakes and no mechanism for slowing down. There is no seatbelt and no air bag. ... Hence, we go fast. Extremely fast,\" Lauscher wrote.|/\n\n\"Nodar's crash wasn't out of the ordinary,\" she added.\n\n\"Its fatal consequence was.\"\n\nSvein Romstad, general secretary of the FIL told Associated Press: \"There\u2019s no doubt in my mind he was absolutely qualified.\u201d\n\nKumaritashvili\u2019s family: Life after tragedy\n\nDespite believing their son was not at fault, Kumaritashvili\u2019s family will not file a lawsuit against the FIL. They are sure the Whistler Slide Center\u2019s track in Vancouver had been changed because it was not built correctly.\n\nKumaritashvilis\u2019 family are continuing to grieve their son but are faced with other problems.\n\nBesides financial needs, they are not satisfied with the amount of attention granted by the Municipality to Kumaritashvlis\u2019 grave in his home village Bakuriani, in the Borjomi province. They were promised a luge track would be erected in Kumaritashvili\u2019s name but four years after his death, this has not started.\n\nNodar's grave in Bakuriani. Photo by N. Alavidze. See more \"In pictures\".\n\nA few days ago, President of the Georgian National Olympic Committee Leri Khabelov and his colleagues visited the Kumaritashvili family. Khabelov said if Nodar was alive, he most probably would have participated in the Sochi Olympics,so gave his family the official Georgian Olympic outfit for the upcoming Games.\n\nOlympic Committee officials have discussed problematic issues with the Kumaritashvili family, which included a promise to resolve track building issues.\n\nGeorgian Olympic Committee representative Kakha Beridze said at the beginning the parties talked about building a luge track in Kumaritashvili\u2019s name but then it was decided that it would be a sports complex where various sportsmen would be able to train.\n\nHe said the International Olympic Committee had already transferred money for the project but there were some bureaucratic issues to resolve.\n\nKumaritashvili's house in Bakuriani.

Anyway, the decision to build the track is taken,\u201d Kipiani said.\n\nThe Kumaritashvili family stated they were angry because of delaysand not knowing if the track was going to be built or not. They said they were also promised that Nodar\u2019s grave behind the Holy Christmas Church in Bakuriani would be adequately fenced order to keep it well protected but this has not happened. Furthermore, they were told the Olympic Committee would build a museum in Bakuriani which would be named after Kumaritashvili.\n\nBeneath Kumaritashvili\u2019s grave, there is a stone memorial which depicts the late athlete on a luge with Olympic rings above.\n\n\"Yes, Nodar would go to Sochi,\u201d his father said.\n\n\"He was training since he was eight years old and he knew how difficult training for that goal was. The goal is the peak to your training and you devote all your time in your life \u2013 the goal was the Olympic Games. This is why he would go to Sochi\u2026if he were here,\u201d he said.\n\nNodar Kumaritashvili will be honoured at the Sochi Olympic Competition, though."}, {"url": "https://www.aol.com/sports/luge-killed-cousin-slid-olympics-135739019.html", "page_content": "YANQING, China \u2014 Nodar Kumaritashvili was four curves away from Georgian Olympic history when, on that chilling day in 2010, he lost control.\n\nOne moment, he was furthering a family legacy, whizzing down a luge track, completing one last training run before the Games.\n\nThe next, he flew off his sled, over an icy wall, and into a metal pole.\n\nHe would\u2019ve been the first Georgian luger to compete at the Olympics. Instead, he died.\n\nNow, 12 years later, his cousin is.\n\nSaba Kumaritashvili thought about Nodar this week, as he prepared to slide down a rock-hard track here in Yanqing. He pulled his hips forward and clenched his lips, then pushed back, and flung himself into this treacherous, frozen strait. He careened around corners, and flirted with walls, and hit 78 miles per hour.\n\nBut he \u201cwasn\u2019t afraid,\u201d he said after his second run.\u201d Tragedy never threatened to drive him away from the sport.\n\nInstead, he said, \u201cafter Nodar, I didn\u2019t want luge to die in Georgia. I wanted to keep it going.\u201d\n\nSo he did what so many members of his family had done for decades. His story, like Nodar\u2019s, is so much more than a crash or a single-minded Olympic pursuit. It begins with his great grandfather, Aleko, who laid the groundwork, literally. Aleko oversaw the construction of Georgia\u2019s first luge track in the 1970s. His son and grandson took advantage. Saba\u2019s grandfather, Felix, slid to the Junior European Championships a few years later. Saba\u2019s uncle \u2014 Nodar\u2019s father \u2014 then won a USSR youth championship in the final years before the Soviet split. Multiple family members, including Saba\u2019s father, have run the Georgian luge federation since.\n\nDavid Kumaritashvili, father of the Georgia luger Nodar Kumaritashvili who killed on an Olympic training run, shows a photo his son e-mailed from the 2010 Vancouver Olympics. (AP)\n\nSo luge, naturally, entered Saba\u2019s life at an early age, just as it had Nodar\u2019s. His parents guided him into the sport. \u201cI think they wanted it more than me,\u201d he said. Nodar, he said, was also one of his reasons.\n\nThe cousins were 12 years apart. Saba was 9 in 2010 when Nodar did what so many other family members had dreamed of, and then what every luger fears. Saba doesn\u2019t \u201cremember much of him, only moments.\u201d But enough to have Nodar at the forefront of his mind when he posed with Olympic rings, and walked the Olympic track, and stepped into Friday\u2019s Opening Ceremony.\n\nHis continued participation in luge made some family members apprehensive. But Saba never wavered.\n\nNodar had laid down a path. Saba followed it. Nodar was 21 when he qualified for the 2010 Olympics. Saba was 21 when he did last month, and when he completed his final run here on Sunday, with smile and a shake of his head.\n\nHe did not win a medal. He didn\u2019t come close, finishing 31st of 34 in the men\u2019s singles competition.\n\nBut he was here. He was emotional. He was proud of himself. And he was happy.\n\n\u201cVery happy,\u201d he said. \"I\u2019ve done what I needed.\u201d"}]}
