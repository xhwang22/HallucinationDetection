He was promoted to Corporal on 21 June 1915; exactly a month later, he was forwarded to the 2e Groupe d'Aviation. On 27 September, he was assigned to Escadrille 67. He was promoted to Sergeant while with this unit, on 11 March 1916.[1]\n\nWaddington reported for pilot's training at Buc on 3 September 1916. He was awarded Military Pilot's Brevet No. 5254 on 26 January 1917, and forwarded for advanced training at Avord, and then Pau. He was then posted as a pilot with Escadrille N.12 (the \"N\" denoting the unit's use of Nieuports) on 28 March 1917.[1] He teamed with Alfred Auger and Joseph M. X. de S\u00e9vin for his first victory on 11 May 1917.[2] A promotion to Adjutant followed on 20 July 1917, with a further promotion to Sous lieutenant on 25 January 1918. He transferred to Escadrille Spa.154 (which operated Spads), on 6 March 1918.[1] Between 12 April and 22 August 1918, he ran off a string of five victories each over enemy airplanes and observation balloons, with all but one of the wins being shared with such fellow French aces as Xavier Moissinac, Paul Barbreau, Louis Prosper Gros, Michel Coiffard, Jacques Ehrlich, and balloon buster Theophile Condemine.[2] On 19 September 1918, he was transferred to his final wartime post, with Escadrille SPA.31.[1] He scored his final triumph solo ten days later.[2] On 9 November 1918, he was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur to accompany his prior awards of the Croix de Guerre with five palmes, one \u00e9toile de vermeil, one \u00e9toile d'argent, and another \u00e9toile de bronze. He had also won a Belgian Croix de guerre and a Serbian decoration.[1]\n\nPostwar career\n\nWaddington would later rise to lieutenant colonel and command a school for fighter pilots before World War II.[3]\n\nReferences\n\nOver the Front: A Complete Record of the Fighter Aces and Units of the United States and French Air Services, 1914\u20131918 Norman L.

Before World War II he taught zoology and embryology at Strangeways Research Laboratory, Cambridge. From 1947 until his death he was professor of animal genetics at the University of Edinburgh.\n\nBritannica Quiz Genetics Quiz\n\nWaddington performed his first notable work in biology on the development of the embryos of birds and mammals. He showed in 1933 that chemical messengers from certain tissues induce other tissues to develop. These studies of embryonic development led him to investigate the regulatory effects of genes on tissue and organ development. Waddington then attempted, in Organisers and Genes (1940), to relate Mendelian genetics to the new findings of experimental embryology.\n\nDuring World War II, Waddington engaged in operations research for the military. After the war he established for the British Agricultural Research Council the Unit of Animal Genetics, a research organization that studied the genetics and scientific breeding of livestock. He afterward served as chief geneticist for this endeavour.\n\nWaddington published many books on embryology, genetics, and the philosophy of science; his Principles of Embryology (1956) is considered a standard textbook, while The Ethical Animal (1960) and Biology for the Modern World (1962) are leading works of popularized science."}, {"url": "https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/39516-waddington-rachel", "page_content": "Overview Rachel Waddington is a Professor in Oral Biochemistry. With more than 30 years' experience, my research has had a long-standing focus for understanding the role of the extracellular matrix environment in the regulation the biology of bone and dentine repair; research that aims to be translational for provoking clinical benefit. Matrix components and extracellular vesicles produced by mesenchymal stem / progenitor cells contain and regulate the release of a rich cocktail of growth factors, that are collectively important in directing effective and efficient cell signalling during cell differentiation. Recently my research has investigated: how the extracellular matrix environment is altered during systemic conditions such as chronic type 2 diabetes mellitus, leading to inefficient cell signalling that compromises the healing process and exacerbates periodontal tissue destruction;\n\nhow the extracellular matrix environment is altered by blue light therapies and the role of reactive oxygen species in this process.\n\ninvestigating tissue and cell derived matrix products and extracellular vesicles for restoring the signalling environment and potentially reverse delayed bone healing often encountered with these systemic conditions;\n\nthe influence of modifying titanium implant surfaces on cellular activity that is beneficial for promoting bone healing and hence allows for quicker and more efficient integration of medical implants.\n\nResearch The clinical management of bone fractures and implant placement, including revision / replacement is orientated towards obtaining bone healing in the shortest time frame, with the best possible functional recovery, and with the least complications arising; features that remain a challenge for patients with osteoporosis or chronic diabetes. Against this clinical challenge my research has developed a focussed interest towards understanding and exploiting the role of extracellular matrix in directing bone and dentine repair. Below is a summary of current research projects. Alterations to extracellular matrix proteins associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus Within these systemic conditions, the biological activity of mesenchymal stem cells is reported to be impaired leading to delayed bone healing. Within this field of research we have been investigating how a hyperglycaemic environment can lead to changes in the levels of extracellular proteins decorin, biglycan, transforming growth factor \u00df and osteopontin - all of which have the potential to hinder the synthesis of a fully mineralised tissue. Additional studies have investigated how bacterial virulence factors can exacerbate these changes with detrimental consequence for progression of periodontal disease and osteomyelitis in these patients. Cell and tissue derived matrix-based therapies for restoring signalling environment associated with delayed bone healing The extracellular matrix is a rich source of growth factors, integrated into the extracellular matrix that regulates their activity. Our research has investigated the potential of demineralized dentine matrix as a store of growth factors capable of promoting bone repair processes. In addition, our research is currently investigating the potential of extracellular vesicles, secreted from dentally derived mesenchymal stem cells, and their role as carriers of a biologically active cargo capable of enhancing the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells into bone synthesizing osteoblasts. Influence of modified titanium surfaces on bone repair processes Through detailed studies involving a series of standardised cell- and tissue-based assays, we have investigated how defined and subtle surface modifications to titanium implant biomaterials can influence osteoblast differentiation. These studies additionally study cellular activity supporting angiogenesis and appropriate macrophage function, both of which are recognised as pre-requisites for successful bone healing.\n\nTeaching Fellow of Advanced HE since 2001; Awarded Senior fellowship of Advanced HE, 2021.\n\nCurrent Year 1 and year 2 non-clinical lead for BDS course Cardiff University.\n\nUndergraduate and postgraduate teaching - bone and dentine biology, tooth development and structure, periodontal connective tissues in health and disease, osseointegration, fluoride and mineralised tissues and caries development.\n\nProgramme director for MSc Oral Biology, School of Dentistry, Cardiff University.\n\nEducational experience in academic course management; course development and validation; preparation of assessment criteria and content for both formative and summative assessments.\n\nExternal examiner for higher degrees PhD theses.

Tank joined the City of Birmingham Police as a cadet in 1963 and left as a constable six years later. He was to be awarded an external University of London degree in 1969 and an MA in 1970 and doctorate in 1977 from the University of Leeds. He became a Professor of Sociology and then of Politics at the University of Reading before moving to Wolverhampton University in 2005. On retirement he became a Visiting Professor at the Mannheim Centre.\n\nTank was a man with a passion for understanding and remodelling policing in England and overseas (he was, for example, a member of the International Panel testifying before the Goldstone Commission in South Africa). His distinguishing traits always were a commitment to scholarship and a freedom from cant and orthodoxy, exercising an often brave and remarkable critical intelligence. His 'Mugging as a \"Moral Panic\": A Question of Proportion', published in the British Journal of Sociology in 1986, forever punctured some of the claims made in Policing the Crisis. His \"In proportion: race, and police stop and search\" (with Kevin Stenson, and David Don), published in the British Journal of Criminology 2004, forced a reappraisal of some of the lazier arguments that were then in vogue about the police practice of stop and search. His best studies were probably Liberty and Order: Policing Public Order in a Capital City, published in 1994, and Calling the Police, published in 1993. Both were utterly original and revelatory analyses of police work. Towards the end of his life he concentrated on deploying innovatory methods to explore a number of the more intractable contradictions of police work, most notably in Professional Police Practice: Scenarios and Dilemmas, published in 2013.\n\n\n\nAlthough he was always stalwart in promoting and defending an argument, Tank was a modest and amiable man, more prepared to bestow praise on his colleagues and collaborators than to accept it himself. He was a model of kindness and courtliness, a loving husband and a good friend, and I shall miss him greatly.\n\n\n\nPaul Rock\n\nEmeritus Professor of Social Institutions, Department of Sociology, LSE"}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/culture-magazines/waddington-miriam-0", "page_content": "WADDINGTON, Miriam\n\nNationality: Canadian.

My Canadian English takes its cue from the prairies where I was born and conceals more than it reveals. Some concealments: the social, mythic, and linguistic reverberations of the Yiddish and Russian cultures of my childhood, plus the austerity and Scottish accents of my early teachers.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the early 1940s there were few opportunities in Canada to publish a book of poetry. Miriam Waddington's first collection, Green World, was published by John Sutherland's First Statement Press in Montreal, where two active literary groups were about to launch the magazines First Statement and Preview. These writers wanted to see an end to the colonial attitudes that had dominated Canadian writing through the Canadian Authors Association publication Canadian Poetry Magazine.\n\nBetween the appearance of Green World in 1943 and Collected Poems in 1986, Waddington published ten books of poetry. Sharp observation, wit, and compassion have remained constant. A change to short lines in The Glass Trumpet was unconscious and connected with new ways of looking at the world, a matter of zeitgeist, the poet says. Using spaces instead of commas was deliberate and concerned the appearance of a poem on the page. She later began to like commas again, her wish for precise meaning taking precedence.\n\nEarly poems were about birth, mothering, and love, with a few poems about social issues. But with degrees in social work, Waddington became involved with the deprived and dispossessed, and she turned her poetry to subjects of social significance. She met and became fast friends with Dorothy Livesay, who had \"ignored maple leaves\" to write about the desperate condition of people caught in a social revolution. Waddington became a compassionate outsider who saw more and more human misery in her work. As time went on, she wrote more frequently about courts and prisons, and with the publication of The Season's Lovers she realized that she was not in the mainstream of Canadian literature because her poetry could not be called metaphysical and mythic. The Season's Lovers dealt with \"the realities of crippled lives, poverty, and the strange innocence of the weak and rejected.\"\n\nThe exploration of what it means to be Canadian has been a favorite theme of Waddington's. Driving Home: Poems New and Selected contains many poems examining her identity as a Canadian, including the following:\n\nCANADIANS\n\n\n\nHere are\n\nour signatures:\n\ngeese fish eskimo\n\nfaces girl-guide\n\ncookies ink-drawings\n\ntree-plantings summer\n\nstorms and winter\n\nemanations.\n\n\n\nWe look\n\nlike a geography\n\nbut just scratch us\n\nand we bleed like\n\nhistory are full\n\nof modest misery\n\nsensitive\n\nto double-talk\n\ndouble-take\n\n(and double-cross)\n\nin a country\n\ntoo wide\n\nto be single in.\n\n\n\nWaddington says in the afterword to Collected Poems that her attitude to poetry is the same as it was fifty years earlier when she wrote in the 1938 poem \"Unheard Melodies,\"\n\nI the tender and brooding outsider\n\nConcern myself with subtle melodies\n\nFashioning usual themes\n\nIn unknown obscure lives.\n\n\n\n\u2014Patience Wheatley"}, {"url": "https://www.city.ac.uk/about/people/academics/nigel-waddington", "page_content": "Overview\n\nNigel is a former practising barrister, associate professor and designer of City\u2019s Bar Vocational Studies Programme.
