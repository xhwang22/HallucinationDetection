He died on November 27 from natural causes at the age of 94. Miller, one of four Bob Millers to play professional baseball, played for the Philadelphia Phillies from 1949-1958.\n\n(The other Bob Millers: Robert W. Miller played in 1890-91 in the American Association; Robert Gerald Miller played for three teams from 1953-62; Robert Lane Miller played for 10 teams between 1957-74. All four Bob Millers were pitchers.)\n\nRobert John Miller was born on June 16, 1926, in Detroit. He went to high school there, he went to college there, and when his baseball career ended, he spent almost 40 years as a college baseball coach there, too. The only thing that the lifelong National Leaguer didn\u2019t do in Detroit was pitch in a major-league game.\n\nAccording to his obituary in The Detroit News, Miller was a three-sport athlete at St. Mary\u2019s of Redford High School, playing basketball and football as well as baseball. In 1943, Miller was named as a defensive end on the Detroit Free Press All-Catholic League team \u2014 he was also St. Mary\u2019s best wide receiver. As a 6\u20193\u2033 high school junior, he was an intimidating presence on the mound during baseball season. The baseball team won the First Division West Side title in Miller\u2019s senior year of 1944, and he pitched the team to an 8-1 over St. Leo\u2019s to win the title.\n\nSource: The Evening Sun, May 11, 1950.\n\nMiller said that the Detroit Tigers were interested in signing him while he was a high school pitcher. \u201cBut they beat around the bush too much after I lost two Catholic high school city finals to Art Houtteman in Briggs Stadium,\u201d he said. The Tigers focused on Houtteman instead, and he would become an All-Star pitcher for the team.\n\nMiller had to put his education and athletics on hold after high school graduation, as he was inducted into the Army. He served for a total of 26 months. Miller said he spent a month in combat on northern Luzon during six months in the Philippines. He then spent a year in Japan, where he pitched for the entire summer of 1946. After his discharge, he attended the University of Detroit Mercy for two years. He pitched on the school\u2019s baseball team in 1947 and 1948.\n\nDue to his military service, Miller was a 22-year-old sophomore in 1948 and decided to turn pro. He signed with the Philadelphia Phillies and was assigned to the club\u2019s Class-B affiliate in Terre Haute, Ind. After some good relief work, Miller made his first start as a pro on June 10 and beat Springfield 9-3. All of Springfield\u2019s runs were unearned, and Miller fanned 5 in the complete game win. He won 6 games for Terre Haute in 1948 and turned in an excellent season in 1949, winning 19 games and leading the league with 207 strikeouts. He was also one of the team\u2019s better hitters, as he batted .268 with 5 home runs. It wasn\u2019t a lights-out dominant year, as he gave up 255 hits in 255 innings and had an ERA of 3.95, but he still walked away with the Three-I League\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award. He also earned a late-season call-up with the Phillies that year.\n\nMiller threw a scoreless inning of relief against the Reds on September 16, 1949, in his major-league debut. He allowed 1 hit \u2014 a single to Ted Kluszewski. He appeared in 3 games and threw 2-2/3 scoreless innings with the Phillies.\n\nThe 1950 Philadelphia Phillies, aka The Whiz Kids, are one of the most celebrated teams in Phillies history. Even with so many young, inexperienced players on the roster (hence the nickname), the Phillies won 91 games to clinch the NL pennant, the first time the team had finished first since 1915. The pitching staff was anchored by youngsters Robin Roberts, Curt Simmons (the last surviving Whiz Kid) and Miller. In his first full season, Miller turned in an 11-6 record in 35 games (21 starts), with a 3.57 ERA. He threw 7 complete games and 2 shutouts while posting an ERA+ of 113. Miller finished second to the Braves Sam Jethroe for the Rookie of the Year award.\n\nPhillies manager Eddie Sawyer, left, with his Whiz Kids pitching staff: Curt Simmons, Robin Roberts, Bob Miller and Bubba Church.\n\nThe first win of Miller\u2019s career came on April 29, 1950, and was a 2-1 victory over the Boston Braves. Boston\u2019s only run came on a throwing error by catcher Stan Lopata \u2014 an old teammate of Miller\u2019s from the Detroit American Legion days. Miller won his first 8 decisions before the Cubs tagged him with a loss on July 16.\n\nMiller admitted that he was nervous at the start of the season. \u201cBut I\u2019m gaining confidence with every game now that I\u2019ve found major leaguers can be fooled just the same as in the minors.\u201d\n\nMiller wasn\u2019t as effective in the second half of the season thanks to an ailing shoulder. He did start the Phillies\u2019 90th win of the season and pitched into the seventh inning before tiring. The Phillies were swept in the World Series by the Yankees, and Miller started Game Four. He didn\u2019t last long, though. The Yankees leadoff hitter, Gene Woodling, reached on an error by second baseman Granny Hamner. He advanced to second base on a Phil Rizzuto grounder and scored on a single by Yogi Berra. Berra raced to third base on a wild pitch and scored on a double by Joe DiMaggio. That was enough for Phillies manager Eddie Sawyer, who removed Miller for reliever Jim Konstanty. The Yankees, backed by the pitching of Whitey Ford, won 5-2 to win the World Series.\n\nMiller\u2019s excellent rookie season was followed by two bad ones, and he bounced between the big leagues and the minors. He spent most of 1951 as a little-used reliever and accumulated a 2-1 record and 6.82 ERA in 17 games before he was optioned to the Wilmington Blue Rocks in August. In 1952, he made the Opening Day roster and allowed 1 run in 2 innings of work against the New York Giants before being sent to AAA Baltimore. He won 12 games with the Orioles and returned in September to make 2 more appearances, including an unsuccessful start against the Cubs.\n\nSome of those struggles came from a couple of injuries. He injured his back in the second half of the 1950 season when he fell trying to catch a train at the North Philadelphia Station. Then he hurt his arm and wouldn\u2019t be fully healthy until 1953. He began that season in the bullpen, but after Curt Simmons injured his foot in a lawn mower accident and was lost for several weeks, he moved into the starting rotation. Miller turned in an 8-9 record and an even 4.00 ERA in 20 starts and 15 relief outings. Many of those losses were hard-luck defeats, where the Phillies offense failed to support good pitching performances. He had 3 shutouts, including a 2-0 3-hitter against the Milwaukee Braves on September 9.\n\n\u201cI think I pitched the best ball I ever did over those last eight or nine weeks,\u201d Miller later said.\n\nMiller made 16 starts in 1954, but he began to see more work coming out of the bullpen. As a starter in \u201954, he was 3-8 with a 4.96 ERA, but he was 4-1 with a 3.28 ERA as a reliever. Opposing batters hit .260 off him as a reliever but more than 50 points when he started a game. Miller would make just 7 more starts over the final 4 years of his career.\n\nSource: The Philadelphia Inquirer, March 18, 1956.\n\nFor the next three seasons, Miller became a very reliable reliever for new Phillies manager Mayo Smith. He made 40 appearances in 1955 and had a fine 2.41 ERA while earning an 8-4 record. He wasn\u2019t a typical reliever who relied on strikeouts to get through innings \u2014 he had 28 K\u2019s and 28 walks in 89-2/3 innings in 1955 \u2014 but he had the lowest ERA on the staff.\n\nHe could still make a spot start and do very well at it. One of the best games of his career came on August 25, 1956 \u2014 against the Milwaukee Braves. He retired the first 14 batters before Bobby Thomson lined a single to center in the fifth inning. Miller had to settle for a 2-hit, 3-0 shutout. Immediately after the game, he flew to Detroit to attend the funeral of his grandmother, so he couldn\u2019t exactly enjoy the moment.\n\nBetween 1955 and 1957, Miller appeared in 121 games for the Phillies, with 7 starts, and had a 13-15 record with 12 saves. He also had an ERA of 2.84 and a WHIP of 1.230. He attributed his success to the fact that Smith used him exclusively in one role, instead of moving him in and out of the rotation constantly.\n\n\u201cWhen Mayo Smith told me [in 1955] that he planned to restrict me to relief work, I was more than satisfied,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care whether I start or relieve, but I don\u2019t like the idea of doing both.\u201d\n\nMiller made it through his first outing of 1958 safely, pitching 2 scoreless innings against the Pirates on April 24. After that, though, he gave up runs in almost every other game in which he appeared, and he was soon relegated to a mop-up role. He picked up his only win on July 29 by shutting down the Cardinals for 2 innings, lowering his ERA to 9.00 on the season. Shortly after that, the Braves got their revenge for all the times he bested them and scored 6 times off him in 3 innings on August 10. It was his last appearance in the major leagues. The Phillies released him to the Miami Marlins of the International League on August 12, with an 11.69 ERA in 17 games and 36 hits allowed in 22-1/3 innings.\n\nMiller played in a handful of games for Miami and was briefly property of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1959 when they bought his contract in the offseason. That gave them two Bob Millers on the team, which would have made for some confusion had both made the team. The Cardinals returned Miller to Philadelphia, and he pitched briefly in the minors for Buffalo and Montreal before calling it quits at the end of the season.\n\nIn his 10-year career, Miller had a record of 42-42, with 15 saves. He appeared in 261 games and made 58 starts, with 23 complete games and 6 shutouts. He struck out 263 batters and walked 247, and he had a career WHIP of 1.382.\n\nAfter baseball, Miller returned to Detroit and took a job as the assistant baseball coach at the University of Detroit Mercy. When head coach Lloyd Brazil was killed in a car accident in 1965, Miller took over the role and remained head coach until his retirement in 2001. The baseball program was cut by the college in 2004.\n\nSource: University of Detroit Mercy Athletics.\n\nMiller had a career record of 896-780-2 as coach of the Detroit Mercy Titans, the most wins of any coach in the program\u2019s history as well as the most by any Michigan college coach. Sixteen of his former players were drafted by MLB organizations, and more than 40 others signed professional contracts. Several of his players, including Dick Drago, Bill Fahey and Pete Craig, reached the major leagues. His sons Pat and Bob Jr. both played for him as well.\n\nMiller was inducted into the University of Detroit Mercy Hall of Fame in 1979, the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1999 and the Michigan Baseball Hall of Fame in 2020. He received the John Conti Letterman of Distinction Award, which is given to former Titan athletes who go above and beyond at work and in the community, in 2011.\n\nChris Czarnik, a former Titan player who took over as head coach upon Miller\u2019s retirement, said the following: \u201cCoach Miller was a larger-than-life person to generations of Titan baseball players. He was the man that was watching from behind a distant fence at a remote ballpark on a hot and dusty summer evening, and when he saw a Titan, he knew it. Decades later, he could make a former player beam with pride by recalling that moment, \u2018I remember the first time I saw you swing that bat; he would say, and bring alive a detail of a ringing double in Redford or Livonia or East Detroit \u2013 and how he wouldn\u2019t leave your driveway that night until you told him you would be part of his team. He knew baseball before it could be measured. He loved the game and could feel it in his blood when it was time to squeeze a run in or when a struggling freshman needed a word of confidence. Coach also cherished his players and the University. He made teammates of us, linking generations, and captured an unforgettable era. He earned this legacy. But perhaps the thing I\u2019ll remember coach most for is how his children looked up to him and how proud he was of them. You could see it in their eyes and hear it in his unforgettable voice. I know I speak for all Titans in expressing our love and condolences to his family upon the loss of this legendary man.\u201d\n\nFor more information: The Detroit News\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @rip_mlb\n\n\n\nFollow me on Instagram: @rip_mlb\n\n\n\nFollow me on Facebook: ripbaseball\n\n\n\nSupport RIP Baseball\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/college/2020/11/28/bob-miller-longtime-detroit-mercy-coach-member-1950-phillies-whiz-kids-dies-94/6450987002/", "page_content": "Bob Miller, a Detroit native who was a pitcher for the legendary 1950 Philadelphia Phillies \"Whiz Kids\" team that lost to the New York Yankees in the World Series, and after his playing career returned to his alma mater, University of Detroit, to coach baseball for nearly four decades, died Friday night. He was 94.\n\nMiller pitched for 10 seasons in the major leagues, all with the Phillies, from 1949-58 \u2014 sandwiched between two stints at Detroit, the first as a player, the latter as a coach.\n\n\"What my dad told me not too long ago, he said, 'I've lived a charmed life, I got to live my dream from a little kid, which was to play pro baseball,\" said Bob Miller Jr., one of Miller's four children.\n\n\"Nothing was more important to my dad than baseball and U of D.\"\n\nOne of his best seasons was 1950, when he was 11-6 with a 3.57 ERA in 35 games, 21 of which were starts, as the Phillies went 91-63 to win the National League. Fellow pitcher Curt Simmons is the last surviving member of that Phillies team. (Another teammate on that cast-of-characters squad, late first baseman Eddie Waitkus, was said to be an inspiration for Robert Redford's character in \"The Natural\" \u2014 having been shot by a fan at a hotel early in his career.)\n\nIn 1950, Miller recorded seven complete games and two shutouts, finishing second in National League rookie-of-the-year voting, to the Boston Braves' Sam Jethroe. Miller also made one start in the 1950 World Series, lasting two-thirds of an inning in the must-win Game 4 of the Yankees' eventual sweep. That was the lone postseason appearance of his career, which spanned 261 games, 68 of which were starts. He was mostly a reliever the rest of his career, and even closed games late in his career.\n\nA 6-foot-3, 190-pound right-hander, he threw a shutout and had four hits in a game in 1953 at Chicago's Wrigley Field, the only man ever to do that at that historic ballpark. Also in 1953, Miller was the reliever who took over in the eighth inning of a game started by Michigan State alum and future Hall-of-Famer Robin Roberts, who was working on a 28-game complete-game streak.\n\nMiller pitched in the minor leagues in 1959, for the Phillies and Los Angeles Dodgers (he also briefly was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, but never pitched for them in the minors or majors), before retiring.\n\nIn 1963, he took a job as an assistant coach for the University of Detroit baseball team.\n\nHis boss, head coach Lloyd Brazil, died in a car accident in 1965 and Miller took over as head coach, a job he held through the 2001 season. During his tenure, Miller's teams were was 896-780-2, his wins ranking in the top 30 in NCAA history, and tops for any baseball coach in Michigan.\n\nUnder Miller, Detroit had winning seasons 25 of 36 years, making the NCAA Tournament in 1965 and winning a school-record 36 games in 1975. In 1997, it won its first Midwestern Collegiate Conference.\n\nSixteen Detroit players were drafted by MLB during Miller's coaching tenure, including son Pat in 1990, and two of them made the major leagues, Pete Craig and Dick Drago. His son Bob Jr. also played for him.\n\nThe job wasn't just coaching. He also mowed the baseball field's grass, laid the chalk, raked the field, and ran the tractor. He never had a paid assistant coach, so he did all the recruiting himself.\n\n\"He made hardly any money, and worked 60 hours a week,\" Bob Miller Jr. said. \"He did it all himself, and he gladly did it because he loved U of D.\"\n\nMiller retired after the 2001 season; in 2004, Detroit Mercy baseball was cut because of budget issues.\n\nMiller played three sports at St. Mary's of Redford, including football and basketball. He had basketball scholarship offers, but out of high school he served four years in the U.S. Army, including in World War II. After his armed-services career, he attended Detroit Mercy and pitched two seasons, 1947-48. As a freshman, he was 3-2 with a 2.34 ERA; sophomore season, he had three wins. The Phillies then signed him.\n\nMiller is a member of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and Detroit Mercy's Hall of Fame (1979). He was scheduled to be inducted to the Michigan Baseball of Fame, along with former Michigan quarterback Drew Henson, in August, but the ceremony was canceled because of COVID-19.\n\nMiller died of natural causes, and lived in West Bloomfield. He is survived by his four children, Thomas, Bob, Mary and Patrick. His wife, Maureen, died 20 years ago.\n\nFuneral arrangements were pending Saturday afternoon, and a celebration of life will take place in 2021.\n\ntpaul@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter: @tonypaul1984"}, {"url": "https://sites.udmercy.edu/campusconnection/2020/11/27/titans-mourn-the-loss-of-former-student-athlete-coach-bob-miller/", "page_content": "University of Detroit Mercy is in mourning as Bob Miller \u2014 a former student-athlete and longtime baseball coach at the University and former Major League Baseball player \u2014 passed away on Saturday due to natural causes. Miller was 94 years old.\n\nAfter serving four years in the military following an outstanding prep career, Miller pitched two seasons for the Titans from 1947-48 before signing with the Philadelphia Phillies. As a freshman, he was 3-2 with a 2.34 ERA and then collected another three wins as a sophomore.\n\nAfter his professional days were over, he came back to his alma mater as an assistant coach in 1963 before taking the reins in 1965 following the tragic auto accident that took the life of head coach Lloyd Brazil, his college coach. That turned into 36 years of greatness as he guided his alma mater from 1965 to 2001, recording an 896-780-2 mark, top 30 in NCAA history when he retired and still the most by any coach in the state of Michigan.\n\nThe Titans tallied winning seasons in 25 of his 36 years \u2013 including reaching 30 victories nine times with a school-record 36 victories in 1975 \u2013 reaching the NCAA Tournament in 1965 and claiming its first-ever MCC baseball championship in 1997.\n\nDuring Miller\u2019s time, 16 Titans were drafted by MLB teams, including his son, Pat, in 1990, while over 40 other players signed professional contracts. Two of the players he coached made it to the major leagues in Pete Craig (1966) and Dick Drago (1969).\n\nMiller signed with Philadelphia in 1948 and enjoyed a 10-year career with the Phillies, appearing in 261 games, starting 69 and going 42\u201342 with 15 saves and a 3.96 ERA.\n\nMiller\u2019s outstanding second season in the minor leagues sparked a promotion to the MLB at the end of the 1949 season, where he made his debut at 23 years old pitched in three games and did not allow a run in 2 2/3 innings.\n\nIn 1950, Miller was a member of the Phillies\u2019 \u201cWhiz Kids\u201d team that won the National League pennant. He finished second for the Rookie of the Year award after going 11-6 with a 3.57 ERA over 190.0 innings pitched, posting one save, throwing seven complete games and notching two shutouts. He was used primarily as a starter, appearing in 25 games with 22 starts.\n\nHe won his first game as a major leaguer on April 29, 1950, tossing a complete game in a 2-1 win at home over the Boston Braves, scattering six hits and striking out seven. Miller started his professional career with an 8-0 record and, at one point, had thrown 22 2/3 straight scoreless innings. He would also start Game 4 of the 1950 World Series against the New York Yankees.\n\nMiller was part of two historic moments in the 1953 season. First, he was the reliever who entered the game for Philadelphia ace Robin Roberts, who was en route to a major-league record 29 consecutive complete-game starts when he ran into trouble in the eighth inning against the Dodgers. Against the Cubs, he tossed a 7-0 complete game shutout giving up just six hits, but he was also 4-for-5 at the plate with two runs scored and a RBI, making him the only pitcher in baseball history to throw a shutout and get four hits in the same game at Wrigley Field.\n\nHe would make 36 starts between the 1953-54 season and in 1955, he went 8-4 with a 2.41 ERA and allowed only 80 hits in 89.0 innings, with all 40 appearances coming out of the bullpen.\n\nMiller was a three-sport star in high school, playing baseball, football and basketball at St. Mary\u2019s in Redford, Mich., and actually earned a basketball scholarship to the University before pursuing baseball when he came back from the war.\n\nMiller has been inducted into a number of Hall of Fames, including the Titan Hall Of Fame (1979), Michigan Sports Hall of Fame (1999) and the Michigan Baseball Hall Of Fame (2020). In 2011, he received the John Conti Letterman of Distinction Award, presented to former Titan varsity athletes who go above and beyond at work and in the community.\n\nFinal arrangements are being made for family only, but a celebration of his life will be announced in the future.\n\nIn remembrance of Bob Miller\n\n\u201cI was deeply hit when I heard the news of coach Miller passing. He was an icon here for so many years and touched so many players. I hear stories all the time of how much he meant to this University and how much he loved U-D. I have had the chance to talk to him and his kids since I have been here and something that always comes across is the love and pride for the University that the Miller family has. He will truly be missed by everyone.\u201d \u2013 Robert C. Vowels, Jr., Detroit Mercy Director of Athletics\n\n\u201cCoach Miller was a larger-than-life person to generations of Titan baseball players. He was the man that was watching from behind a distant fence at a remote ballpark on a hot and dusty summer evening, and when he saw a Titan, he knew it.

We use to drive cars to our games and my first year, we rode a lot with coach Miller and he was such a funny guy and a prankster. I will always remember how lively he was and he loved the school, he loved U-D. One day, I remember in practice, he was pitching to us and he said the way he was feeling right now, he was probably in his late 30\u2019s, that he hoped he didn\u2019t give up baseball too soon. He loved the game.\u201d \u2013 Donald Deptula, former player from 1963-66\n\n\u201cThis was just devastating. He was a great, great guy, a great coach and mentor and he meant everything to me. That booming voice, the presence he had whenever he walked in a room. He had that personality that everyone loved. He was good to everyone and it\u2019s quite a loss. He was everything to me, he gave me my chance, believed in me and gave me confidence and I will always be grateful for that. If you can live a life like him, that\u2019s the way to do it. He was a great family man, great baseball guy and couldn\u2019t ask for a better coach.\u201d \u2013 Mike Polvi, former player from 1974-78\n\nMedia stories on Bob Miller\n\nMLB.com \u2013 \u201cMiller looks back at 10-year career\u201d\n\nSociety for American Baseball Research (SABR) \u2013 \u201cBob Miller\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia Inquirer \u2013 \u201cIn memory of Bob Miller \u2013 Curt Simmons and Bob Miller, the last two Phillies Whiz Kids, keep the memories alive\u201d\n\nThe Detroit News \u2013 \u201cBob Miller, longtime Detroit coach, member of 1950 Phillies \u2018Whiz Kids,\u2019 dies at 94\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies \u2013 \u201cRemembering Bob Miller\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.dead-people.com/Bob-Miller", "page_content": "Bob Miller\n\nAmerican ice hockey player (Boston Bruins).\n\nDied on Friday October 2nd 2020\n\nThank you for saying goodbye to\n\nClick here to say your final goodbye\n\nTweets related to Bob Miller:\n\n@JBCP: RT @BigBlendMag: Hear about Odessa #Delaware on #BigBlendRadio today, live online at 2pm ET from Miller-Dunham House B&B @HouseDunham w/ in\u2026 - 3 years ago\n\n@ParksTravelMag: RT @BigBlendMag: Hear about Odessa #Delaware on #BigBlendRadio today, live online at 2pm ET from Miller-Dunham House B&B @HouseDunham w/ in\u2026 - 3 years ago\n\n@regalagent: RT @BigBlendMag: Hear about Odessa #Delaware on #BigBlendRadio today, live online at 2pm ET from Miller-Dunham House B&B @HouseDunham w/ in\u2026 - 3 years ago\n\n@ArtisticEye1: RT @StatonRabin: The late Tommy Rall (the one with the mustache, in the light green tights), 1929-2020-- in \"Kiss Me Kate\" with Ann Miller,\u2026 - 3 years ago\n\n@Kirsten_jay: @chadopitz For me it\u2019s Dennis Miller\u2019s head bob/shake thing \u201cthat\u2019s the news and iiiiiiiii ammmmm out of herrrrre!\u201d - 3 years ago\n\n@brodowski_bob: RT @baseballhall: Since 1997, Jon Miller has lent his voice to some of the most exciting moments in @SFGiants history.
