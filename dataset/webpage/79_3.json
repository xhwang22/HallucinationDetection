{"Duncan Mackay represented Scotland at the 1974 FIFA World Cup.": [{"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52892073", "page_content": "The 1974 World Cup - what do you think of? West Germany, total football, Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer? No? Perhaps just one team remaining unbeaten during the tournament, only to be knocked out in the first round having conceded just a single goal?\n\nScotland were the only team from the British Isles to make it. What's more, it was the first time they had qualified since 1958. The official World Cup song was called Easy, Easy - but it wasn't conceit or hubris that was their downfall, it was goal difference.\n\nJoe Jordan and Davie Hay played in all three matches in West Germany. They talk us through the campaign...\n\nRowing boats & sinking the Auld Enemy\n\nPreparations were eye opening, to say the least. After mixed results in the Home Internationals, Scotland had warm-up matches in Belgium and Norway. Then there was the incident in Largs...\n\nManager Willie Ormond allowed the players go for a night out in the coastal town and, in the early hours, winger Jimmy Johnstone decided to commandeer a rowing boat. Only problem was, he had no oars and began to drift out to sea. Hay and Eric Schaedler tried to rescue him, but the boat they purloined had a hole in it so they frantically rowed back to the shore. Johnstone had to be rescued by the coastguard, becoming front page news in the process.\n\n\"We gave the perfect response the following Saturday by beating England 2-0,\" says Hay. \"You couldn't say Jimmy beat England singlehandedly but he helped destroy them. I always say the perfect preparation should be going out for the evening, having a few drinks, and then a boating trip...\"\n\nOff to a winning start\n\nDavie Hay crosses the ball in the opening victory for Scotland\n\n14 June, Dortmund. Scotland 2-0 Zaire\n\nWith world champions Brazil drawing 0-0 with Yugoslavia the previous day, Scotland's win over the inexperienced Africans - with goals from Jordan and Peter Lorimer - took them top of group two.\n\n\"There was serious pressure on us because we were the favourites,\" Hay recalls. \"I remember it was exceptionally warm and, being 2-0 up at half-time, I think we took the foot of the gas.\"\n\n\"In hindsight we should have tried to score more goals,\" Jordan adds. \"Looking at the big picture it was a mistake. There was a bit of naivety in it. If that game had been our second or third the scoreline might have been a little different.\"\n\nThe most famous 0-0 in Scottish football\n\n18 June, Frankfurt. Scotland 0 Brazil 0\n\nScotland had the best chance of the game against the world champions. A Jordan header was saved by Leao but the rebound struck captain Billy Bremner's shin and squirmed inches past. \"It wasn't like he could side foot it in - it bounced off him,\" Jordan says.\n\n\"It wasn't the result we wanted but we didn't feel it was an opportunity missed. We were in a position where we were going into the Yugoslavia game knowing a win would take us through.\"\n\nBilly Bremner goes agonisingly close against Brazil\n\nIt was a sterling showing and remains the last time Brazil were denied victory by Scotland.\n\n\"I watched the highlights recently and what impressed me was how balanced the team was,\" said Hay. \"They didn't have Pele, but you are still playing against that magic yellow jersey. In the first 10 minutes we were under the cosh a wee bit, but from then on we were slightly the better team.\"\n\nMeanwhile in Gelsenkirchen, Yugoslavia thrashed Zaire 9-0 amid claims the Africans had threatened to strike before the game over missing payments.\n\nZaire head coach Miljan Miljanic had been a Yugoslavia international as a player. And, with his team 3-0 down after 21 minutes, he replaced his goalkeeper with a 5ft 4in stand-in. Sixty seconds later it was four. \"You often find that smaller nations are always up for the first game then fall away,\" Hay says. \"But when you bring on a goalie who is Tom Thumb and they lose nine goals...\"\n\n'We should have done more damage'\n\n22 June, Frankfurt. Scotland 1-1 Yugoslavia\n\nVictory would take Scotland into the last eight. Even a draw would have been good enough if Brazil failed to beat Zaire by three clear goals. But they did, winning 3-0.\n\nThe Scots fall a goal behind with fewer than 10 minutes left, with Jordan's late equaliser not enough. Yugoslavia, Brazil and Scotland finish level on points, with the team who scored fewest against Zaire eliminated.\n\n\"Over the three games, we only conceded one goal,\" Jordan says. \"You go back to the Zaire game, there's a lot of disappointment - we should done a lot more damage.\"\n\n\"The only thing Ormond could have done differently was maybe bring Johnstone on against Brazil and Yugoslavia. He didn't play in a single game. I don't know if that was for disciplinary reasons. On reflection, he probably would have made a difference.\"\n\nBrazil and Yugoslavia progressed to the last eight only to both go out in the second group stage. West Germany beat Netherlands 2-1 in the final, but lost to East Germany earlier in the tournament, leaving Scotland as the only unbeaten team in the finals.\n\nThat's got to count for something, right?\n\nScotland squad Goalkeepers: Allan (Dundee), Harvey (Leeds United), Stewart (Kilmarnock); Defenders: Blackley (Hibernian), Buchan (Manchester United), Donachie (Manchester City), Holton (Manchester United), Jardine (Rangers), McGrain (Celtic), McQueen (Leeds United), Schaedler (Hibernian); Midfielders: Bremner (Leeds United), Cormack (Liverpool), Hay (Celtic), Hutchison (Coventry City), Johnstone (Celtic); Strikers: Dalglish (Celtic), Jordan (Leeds United), Law (Manchester City), Lorimer (Leeds United), Morgan (Manchester United)\n\nGet your daily dose of Fifa World Cup reaction, debate & analysis with World Cup Daily on BBC Sounds"}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/players/all-time-a-to-z-of-celtic-players/m/mackay-duncan/", "page_content": "Personal\n\nFullname: Duncan MacKay\n\naka: Dunky MacKay\n\nBorn: 14 July 1937\n\nDied: 23 December 2019\n\nBirthplace: Springburn\n\nSigned: 11 April 1955\n\nLeft: 6 November 1964 (Third Lanark)\n\nPosition: Right-back\n\nDebut: Clyde 1-4 Celtic, League Cup, 9 Aug 1958\n\nInternationals: Scotland\n\nInternational Caps: 14\n\nInternational Goals: 0\n\nBiog\n\nThe classy Duncan MacKay signed for Celtic from Maryhill Harp in April 1955.\n\nOn his signing, he was proclaimed as the find of the season, and for the next season was \u201cthe best defensive prospect in the country\u201c.\n\nThe stylish right-back made his debut in a 4-1 League Cup win at Clyde in August 1958 and would spend the next six years as one of the top performers in disappointing & underachieving Celtic sides.\n\nDuncan MacKay had fantastic pace and stamina and he was a wonderful attacking full-back who was one of the first players in that position to use the over-lap as a regular feature of his game.\n\nWith fine control and a pin-point accurate pass, Duncan MacKay would always attempt to play the ball out of defence rather than just rely on the long clearance up the park. He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great. His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\nA highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\nHe would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\nIn November 1984, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland. He also gained 14 caps for Scotland during his playing career.\n\nThe thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic are with Duncan\u2019s family and friends at this very sad time.\n\nThe Celtic players will wear black armbands at today\u2019s game against St Mirren as a mark of respect.\n\nObituary: Duncan Mackay, highly esteemed Celtic full-back who won honours in Australia\n\nBy Matt Vallance\n\n(2)\n\nSource: https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18141730.obituary-duncan-mackay-highly-esteemed-celtic-full-back-won-honours-australia/Former Celtic captain and Scotland full-back\n\nBorn:July 14, 1937;\n\nDied: December 23, 2019.\n\nIT IS a long way from Maryhill to Melbourne, but in his 82 years that was the journey made by the esteemed former Celtic and Scotland full-back Dunky Mackay.\n\nLike many before him, Duncan\u2019s father, also Duncan, had left the West Highlands for the city, where he worked at several jobs to keep a roof over his family\u2019s head. He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/duncan.mackay/2398366", "page_content": "Duncan MacKay\n\nassociation football player\n\nJuly 14, 1937 Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Mackay turned professional when he joined Celtic from Maryhill Harp aged 17 in 1955.

Thirds were relegated at the end of the 1964-1965 season though, and MacKay was one of several players released. MacKay opted to move to Australia at this juncture, joining Melbourne Croatia of the Victorian State League.

No, the hosts and eventual champions lost to East Germany in the group stage. The Netherlands were without a loss until bettered by the Germans in the final.\n\nGive up? Well, that country was in fact Scotland. Outside of hard-core Scottish supporters, many don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize this fact of life, mainly because the Scots failed to advance beyond the group stage of the tournament even though they never tasted defeat.\n\nA Quality Side\n\nLeeds United were the finest side in English football in 1974 and much of the nucleus of that club were also ever present in the Scotland 11. Midfielder Billy Bremner was captain, and David Harvey was first-choice goalkeeper, while Peter Lorimer and Joe Jordan were clinical finishers up front.\n\n\u201cLeeds United \u2013 North Wales Whites\u201d by joncandy is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\n\nThe Old Firm was well represented in manager Willie Ormond\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s squad as well. The Celtic duo of veteran Jimmy Johnstone and Davie Hay provided a midfield presence, with young Kenny Dalglish in a striker\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role. Danny McGrain of Celtic and Sandy Jardine were solid in the back four, joined by Manchester United\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Martin Buchan and Jim Holton.\n\nManchester City\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Denis Law, nearing the end of a legendary career, was a sage presence among the strikeforce.\n\nAn Ominous Start\n\nScotland was holding a pre-tournament training camp in Norway. During a night of carousing, Johnstone commandeered a rowboat but after pushing out to sea, realized that in the darkness he hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t noticed there were no oars. The Coast Guard was called in to rescue him and it became national news.\n\nThe following weekend, Scotland whipped England 2-0 and the ruckus seemed to quiet.\n\nOff To Germany\n\nScotland were grouped with defending champion Brazil, Yugoslavia and African minnow Zaire. The Scots would open against Zaire.\n\nIt started out splendidly. Jordan and Lorimer potted first-half goals. \u201cI remember it was exceptionally warm and, being 2-0 up at half-time, I think we took the foot of the gas,\u201d Hay told BBC Sport.\n\nThe match finished 2-0 to Scotland. \u201cIn hindsight we should have tried to score more goals,\u201d Jordan admitted to BBC Sport. \u201cLooking at the big picture, it was a mistake.

It ended in a scoreless draw. Scotland came closest to finding the back of the net. Brazil \u00e2\u20ac\u2122keeper Emerson Leao sprawled to save a Jordan header. The rebound hit Bremner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shin, skidding inches wide of the post.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have Pele, but you are still playing against that magic yellow jersey,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Hay recalled. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In the first 10 minutes we were under the cosh a wee bit, but from then on we were slightly the better team.\u201d\n\nYugoslavia thrashed Zaire 9-0, so Scotland\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission was a simple one \u2013 beat the Yugoslavs and advance.\n\nYugoslavia grabbed the lead with 10 minutes to play.

Every major event is special in its own way\n\nSo the FIFA World Cup, which ended yesterday with France lifting the trophy for the second time with a 4-2 victory over Croatia at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, was officially the greatest in the tournament's 88-year history.\n\nWho says so?\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino, that's who.\n\n\"It's been the best World Cup in history,\" he said.\n\n\"For a couple of years I thought that would be the case, but now I can say it with conviction.\"\n\nBut how does Infantino know it was the best?\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino, left, declared the World Cup in Russia as the \"best in history\" - which will no doubt have pleased its country's leader Vladimir Putin \u00a9Getty Images\n\nInfantino was born in March 1970, just a few months before Mexico hosted that year's World Cup, a tournament that to those old enough to remember is still considered the \"greatest\", mainly because it was the first shown on colour television and broadcast into homes around the world the striking images of a Brazilian team playing a brand of football that defined a generation. Was that tournament any less a successful World Cup than Russia 2018?\n\nFor other football fans of a certain age, it is Spain 1982 and the unlikely resurrection of Paolo Rossi as Italy won the World Cup that stirs the memories.\n\nFor me personally, I will always have great memories of Germany 2006, travelling around to watch Australia's matches and soaking up the intoxicating atmosphere of the Fan Fests on a diet of bratwurst and beer.\n\nMy point is not to degenerate Russia. I was fortunate enough to be in Moscow in the days leading up to the World Cup and it was clear that this was an event everyone in the country was embracing. The organisation was slick, the hospitality overwhelmingly friendly, the football on occasions breathtaking and there was more drama than in a Hollywood blockbuster.\n\nI, personally, will never forget walking around Red Square and suddenly being confronted by the sight of hundreds of joyous singing dancing Peruvian fans in their team's kit with its distinctive red sash simply celebrating the fact their country had qualified for their first FIFA World Cup since 1982. It was a great moment and captured perfectly the incredible and unique role sport occupies in our society.\n\nTo football fans of a certain age, the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico will always be the best tournament ever \u00a9Getty Images\n\nI do not, however, understand this clamour at every major sports event, like the World Cup or Olympic Games, for it to be declared the \"best ever\".\n\nOf course, I can understand the prestige for someone like Russian President Vladimir Putin being associated with an event watched by billions of people around the world being called \"the greatest\" - it confers upon his country a legitimacy it is currently lacking.\n\nBut don't run away with the idea it is just an authoritarian leader like Putin who desperately craves the kudos of organising an event better than anyone before them.\n\nIn the build-up to the Closing Ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London, the British media speculated for several days whether then International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge would reverse his policy of refusing to anoint each successive edition as the \"best ever\", as his predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch had done.\n\nIn the end, Rogge stuck to his principles and settled on describing London 2012 as \"happy and glorious\" - which the media took as code for the \"best ever\" anyway.\n\nI have friends who still get misty-eyed when thinking back to London that summer and claim it was the greatest period of their lives. But I will let you into a secret - as long as you promise not to tell Sebastian Coe. London 2012 was great and I have wonderful memories of it, but I actually thought Barcelona 1992 and Sydney 2000 were better.\n\nBarcelona marked my Summer Olympic Games debut and they say you always remember your first time. I was blown away by the sheer scale of the event and how it was a giant melting pot of nationalities and cultures.\n\nSydney seemed so exciting being on the other side of the world and after Atlanta 1996, a truly miserable experience if you were a British journalist such was our team's lack of success, it seemed a novelty having so many Team GB medallists on which to report on a daily basis. Does that mean London 2012 was in anyway less better organised than or not as good as Barcelona 1992 or Sydney 2000? No, it was just different with its own unique experiences set in that period of history.\n\nIOC President Jacques Rogge resisted the temptation to declare London 2012 the \"best\" Olympics ever, as predecessor Juan Antonio Samaranch usually did, and instead called it \"happy and glorious\" \u00a9YouTube\n\nIt was the same as last year's International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Championships in London, widely acclaimed as \"the best ever\". They were certainly the best attended with more than 700,000 spectators watching the 10 days of action.\n\nFor sheer drama and impact, though, they lacked the excitement of the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo when Carl Lewis set a world record in the 100 metres in front of the Emperor of Japan and was then involved in a mind-blowing long jump competition where he had to watch as Mike Powell broke Bob Beamon's 23-year-old world record.\n\nLast year's World Championships in London were not even as good, in my opinion, as those at Stuttgart in 1993 when Linford Christie won the 100m or Gothenburg 1995, which saw another Briton, Jonathan Edwards, set a world record in the triple jump so good it will soon pass the anniversary of Beamon's mark, which a lot of people believed would stand forever.\n\nEach World Cup, Olympic Games or IAAF World Championships have their own special qualities and characteristics which set them apart from each other. We should embrace each one and enjoy them on their own merits and for the fabulous memories each create, not try to always compare them.\n\nNick Butler is away and will return on July 30"}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44363843", "page_content": "'Scotland 78 - A Love Story' Date: Wednesday, 6 June Time: 21:00 BST Where: BBC One Scotland & thereafter on BBC iPlayer\n\nThere's a moment in Wednesday's BBC documentary 'Scotland 78 - A Love Story' when Derek Johnstone reflects on the tedium of life cooped up in their hotel in the small town of Alta Gracia, a desolate base camp near Cordoba where Ally MacLeod's squad would spend three weeks in the fateful summer.\n\nSuch was the boredom in the place that the boys, serenaded out of Glasgow against a backdrop of national delirium sparked by MacLeod's hubris, took to watching a colony of leafcutter ants carrying their wares across the grounds of their hotel. The fun, such as it was, came in the task of trying to flick a pebble and knock the leaf out of the ant's jaws.\n\nEven as he's telling the story, 40 years on, there's a look of bewilderment on Johnstone's face. In that, he's far from alone. Bruce Rioch, Joe Harper, Willie Johnston, Alan Rough, Lou Macari, John Robertson - all come across like men who have just spent two hours whirring about in an industrial-sized tumble dryer.\n\nScotland fans savour the atmosphere at the 1978 World Cup in Argentina\n\nThis story of Scotland daring to dream and waking up in a nightmare never gets old. It's a footballing farce, a sporting tragic-comedy. Some of the gold is provided by the Tartan Army and the extraordinary lengths some of them went to in order to be part of history. Not the kind of history they were getting, but history all the same.\n\nHow many books, or chapters of books, have been written about 1978? How many newspaper and magazine articles? How many documentaries? And yet there's a buzz - as there should be in the case of this absorbing film - about a new telling of what went on in Argentina. It's like opium to the people.\n\nNostalgia becomes more and more important to Scotland football fans as the years go by and major championship after major championship carries on without them. In the dog days of the present, there's nowhere to go for a national team thrill except the past and nowhere in the past is the drama more Shakespearean than 1978.\n\nSome of the footage you may have seen, some you undoubtedly haven't. All of it is eye-popping. MacLeod's bravado is of Muhammad Ali proportions. Mixed with the memories of his family in the here and now, it's poignant and sad. Everybody has had a good old laugh at MacLeod's expense over the years, but he was a man with a wife and kids who were suffering at home.\n\nAlly MacLeod hyped up Scotland's hopes in 1978, but his squad fell short in Argentina\n\nAs it all started to unravel, Faye, his widow, says that all she wanted to do was \"fly out and give him a hug\".\n\nYou want to reach into the television and get him to button his lip, but you can't. Had MacLeod been canny and well-prepared then Lord knows what this excellent Scotland squad might have achieved and what impact on Scottish political history it might have had.\n\nHis confidence in his team leads him to say that he's cleared a place in his wardrobe for his World Cup winner's medal. No, Ally. He spoke at times about how the World Cup final date would come to be known as National Ally Day.\n\nIt was pantomime stuff and it was infectious. A bandwagon rolled. AC/DC played a gig wearing Scotland jerseys. Blue Peter presented the somewhat perplexed squad with a special good luck badge. Companies piled in to get a bit of the action. Chrysler cars, Trustee Savings Bank, the Valentine greetings card company.\n\nScottish nationalism was on the march with the SNP making record gains. A pro-union newspaper in England wrote that Scotland winning the World Cup would be like \"distilled firewater. Hooched up on that, the nationalists could rampage to victory\".\n\nMacLeod basked in the attention as the pied piper of Scottish football. His status as a hero to follow is perhaps best illustrated by a clip of him getting love-bombed by a group of fans as he's loading up the boot of his car before his departure for Argentina. \"Ally,\" says one Scottish youngster. \"See the day after your commercial, my ma bought one of they carpets.\"\n\nIn 1978, Scots roamed across the British football landscape like gods. In the August of 1977, Kenny Dalglish had become Britain's most expensive footballer when arriving at Liverpool. Five months later, Gordon McQueen would set a new transfer record when joining Manchester United.\n\nA 27-year-old Dalglish had just scored the winning goal for Liverpool in the European Cup final prior to the 1978 World Cup\n\nLiverpool had just won the European Cup with Alan Hansen, Graeme Souness and Dalglish the spine of the team. Ipswich had just won the FA Cup with John Wark and George Burley. Nottingham Forest had won the First Division title and the League Cup with Kenny Burns, Archie Gemmill, John McGovern and John Robertson. Burns was the player of the year in England. A fine Rangers team had won the domestic treble.\n\nAnd Scotland? In the qualifiers for the '78 World Cup they'd eliminated Czechoslovakia, the reigning champions of Europe. By that summer, MacLeod's squad had in its ranks almost 60 individual medals, from champions of Scotland and England, to Scottish Cup and FA Cup winners, to European Cup, Uefa Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup winners. His group was loaded with quality.\n\nThe manager was perfectly entitled to think to himself that they might be good enough to win the World Cup. Saying it out loud again and again and again like Ali on speed was where his problems started.\n\nNo research was done on the opposition. A television company offered MacLeod an all-expenses paid trip to watch Peru before the tournament, but he turned it down. In qualifying, the Peruvians had topped their section ahead of Chile and had put five goals past Bolivia, who had already knocked out Uruguay, but Scotland's players knew none of this. Peru played Brazil and lost just 1-0.\n\nHector Chumpitaz (right) captained Peru to an opening group win over Scotland\n\nIran were a poor side but no work was done on how to expose them. That was the ultimate sin. MacLeod was in too much of a rush to get to the final to worry that much about how he intended to get there.\n\nMore than 25,000 people sent Scotland on their way at Hampden and only about 100 were there as they slinked back into the country. The players dispersed and carried on winning trophies by the bundle. The success they had with their clubs just reinforced the gigantic failure they experienced in Argentina.\n\nThere's a mesmeric quality to this story of '78, a legend of how a man and a country lost the run of itself. The team didn't endure, but the tale of the struggle will live forever.\n\n'Scotland 78 - A Love Story' will be broadcast on BBC One Scotland on Wednesday 6 June at 21:00 BST and thereafter on the BBC iPlayer"}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37363978/1974", "page_content": "Winners: West Germany\n\nTeams: 16\n\nTeams in qualifiers: 99\n\nNotable absentees: England, France, Hungary, Spain, Soviet Union\n\nSurprises: Australia, Haiti and Zaire\n\nGolden Boot: Grzegorz Lato (Poland) -- 7\n\nStats: A total of 97 goals were scored (2.55 per match); Poland (16) scored the most\n\nFormat: Four groups of four in the qualifying stage, with the top two from each group going into a second round of two four-team groups and the winners facing each other in the final\n\nNumber of matches: 38\n\nInnovations\n\n\u2022 FIFA commissioned a new trophy after Brazil were allowed to keep the Jules Rimet\n\nControversies\n\n\u2022 The Soviet Union were knocked out in the final qualifying round after refusing to play in Chile, where there had recently been a military coup, with thousands of supporters of Marxist president Salvador Allende executed in the football stadium.

By the time the Mondial returned in 1974, the map of world football had changed.\n\nThe mid-'70s represented the era of \"total football,\" and Ajax and Bayern Munich dominated the European club scene with this free-flowing, interchangeable approach. While the Netherlands, who featured the likes of Johan Cruyff, Johan Neeskens, Ruud Krol and Willem van Hanegem, played a more attractive and cavalier game, the West Germans had won the European Nations Cup in 1972, playing a more functional but devastatingly effective brand of it. Two years later, they were perhaps a little more defensive, no longer relying on midfield counterpoint Guenter Netzer, but seemingly the only team who had a chance of stopping the devastating Dutch.\n\nBrazil were a spent force, playing an ugly, Europeanised form of football. With Pele now gone and Gerson and Tostao also out of the picture, they were fortunate not to lose to the ever-unlucky Scotland in the group stages and only just sneaked into the newly-added second group stage.\n\nElsewhere, the Netherlands qualified from their group with ease. West Germany didn't find it quite so easy, suffering a hugely embarrassing loss to the East Germans and struggling to beat Chile and Australia, who were making their first appearance in the finals (and last for 32 years).\n\nThe highest-profile first-round casualties were the Italians, who had struggled to beat Haiti and then been beaten by Poland in the final group game. The Poles -- England's conquerors in the qualifiers after Jan Tomaszewski, the keeper labelled by Brian Clough as a \"clown,\" had thwarted them at Wembley -- featured the talents of the wonderfully-named defender Jerzy Gorgon, midfield creator Kazimierz Deyna and free-scoring winger Grzegorz Lato, and enjoyed their best-ever World Cup.\n\nThe second stage saw the Netherlands really get into gear. With Cruyff at his mercurial best, they hammered Argentina 4-0, eased past the East Germans and then compounded the new world order of international football by soundly beating the Brazilians. Neeskens and Cruyff scored two great goals to put them into the final.\n\nThe other group was far less straightforward as both West Germany and the Poles looked strong in seeing off the challenges of Sweden and Yugoslavia. Netherlands' opponents would be decided in the last group game. Despite a fine showing from the Poles, home advantage stood in Frankfurt when Gerd Mueller, Bayern Munich's finisher of finishers, scored in the 76th minute to set up a date with destiny in Munich.\n\nIt was one of the most eagerly-awaited finals in years with few able to choose between the two and, considering the historical enmity between the two countries, it was a game that meant far more than football.\n\nThe Dutch, children of World War II and its aftermath, seemed intent on humiliating the Germans and, after an amazing first minute where Netherlands passed the ball around without the Germans touching the ball, Cruyff set off into the box with typical purpose. Future Scotland manager Berti Vogts brought him down and Neeskens did the rest from the penalty spot.\n\nAfter that, Netherlands chose to play keep-ball and mock the Germans. But, marshalled by Franz Beckenbauer, the hosts held their nerve and were rewarded when a forceful run by Bernd Hoelzenbein was ended after a tackle by Wim Jansen. Referee Jack Taylor pointed to the penalty spot. The Dutch accused the German winger of diving but the end result was Paul Breitner drilling the ball past Jan Jongbloed in the 25th minute.\n\nTwo minutes before half-time, the Germans were in the lead. The scorer was Mueller, in his last international, who executed a pirouette to fire in. Demoralised just before the break, the Dutch came out fighting in the second half, but the lethargy and teasing of the early part of the game was hard to shake off. Though Neeskens went close twice, keeper Sepp Maier was equal to the task.\n\nThe West Germans had beaten their bitter rivals and dashed the hopes of the footballing romantic -- just as they had done in 1954 with the Hungarians. Cruyff was soon to sneak into World Cup exile. Beckenbauer, who had previously lost a final and come third in 1970, lifted the newly issued FIFA World Cup Trophy."}, {"url": "https://www.socceroos.com.au/news/stats-insider-socceroos-first-ever-fifa-world-cup-match-1974", "page_content": "Stats Insider: Socceroos' first ever FIFA World Cup match in 1974\n\nOn the 14th June in 1974, Australia travelled to Volksparkstadion in Hamburg to face East Germany in their first ever fixture in the game\u2019s most elite competition.\n\nDespite losing 2-1 to Israel in their final friendly before the 1974 FIFA World Cup, Australia came into the game on the back of imposing form thanks to a rampaging qualification run, which saw them lose only once from 11 games (W5, D5).\n\nBranko Buljevic would be the first Australian to launch a shot at goal in a World Cup fixture, launching an unassisted shot in the 20th minute to truly get Australia\u2019s campaign underway.\n\nAustralia - 1974 FIFA World Cup Player Games Total Shots Shots on Target Adrian Alston 3 6 1 Jimmy Mackay 3 4 0 Ray Richards 3 3 0 Attila Abonyi 2 2 1 Colin Curran 3 2 0 John Warren 1 1 0 Peter Ollerton 2 1 0 Branco Buljevic 3 1 0\n\n\n\nTeammate Adrian Alston would be the only Australian to attempt multiple shots in the game and would go on to become the country\u2019s most likely to find the back of the net throughout the remainder of the tournament.\n\nAlston finished the tournament with six shots from three appearances, as well as finding one of the only two shots on target by an Australian player throughout the campaign when he faced eventual champions West Germany later in the competition.\n\n1974 FIFA World Cup Team Games Tackles Tackles Won Success Scotland 3 64 54 84% Australia 3 93 73 78% Argentina 6 133 104 78% Bulgaria 3 52 40 77% Netherlands 7 173 133 77% Poland 7 220 169 77% Yugoslavia 6 148 113 76% Congo DR 3 70 53 76% Germany 7 214 162 76% East Germany 6 150 110 73% Haiti 3 71 52 73% Brazil 7 173 125 72% Italy 3 59 40 68% Chile 3 72 48 67% Uruguay 3 70 45 64% Sweden 6 157 99 63%\n\n\n\nAustralia gave East Germany staunch opposition in defence, though, pressuring the East German attack at every opportunity.\n\nAustralia won 20 of their 28 tackle attempts throughout their maiden World Cup game \u2013 figures that no other team would be able to reach throughout the remainder of East Germany\u2019s six-game campaign.\n\nIt is a defensive theme that ran throughout the entire campaign for Australia.\n\nIndeed, they finished the campaign with a tackle success rate of 78% - the second highest of any team at the tournament.\n\nJimmy Mackay (Australia) was one of the best tacklers in the competition.
