While that is undeniably true, BTS has proven its worth time and time again via its ingenious musical expertise and unmatched stage presence.\n\nThe BigHit Entertainment group has given the K-Pop wave a new chance at becoming one of the most profitable industries in the world \u2014 and that they did. While BTS became known for its multi-skilled members and versatile discography, all seven idols have pursued their own solo endeavors outside of BTS in one way or another. In the form of EPs, singles, and studio albums, all of the BTS members have worked on their individuality and unique sound disconnected from BTS\u2019 own repertoire.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, BTS and HYBE announced the group would go on a break from group activities after the release of their anthology album, Proof. This would mark the start of BTS\u2019 individual journey as each member enlists in their mandatory military service. So far, two studio albums have been released, so here are all the seven solo albums and EPs from each member to discover if you\u2019re missing BTS a little too much.\n\nRM \u2014 RM (2015), Mono (2018), and Indigo (2022)\n\nThe leader and lead rapper of BTS, Kim Namjoon, known by his stage name RM, has shown time and time again his desire to work on flashing his individual colors through the release of his solo music. His self-entitled EP RM was released on Soundcloud two years after BTS\u2019 debut. Comprising 11 tracks, RM engulfs fans and listeners with his insecurities and doubts as a person and musician. This mixtape marks the first out of three incredibly personal and introspective music records.\n\nNext up came Mono, three years later. This mixtape features seven songs, all sung in Korean and English alike. RM laid bare his insecurities once again, through the constant thematics surrounding loneliness and sorrow. In spite of its broodier themes, Vulture still qualifies this EP as the perfect amount of comforting, stating it \u201csounds like how settling into a lukewarm bath feels: cleansing, just the right amount of steamy, and soothing to the touch.\u201d\n\nHis third and most recent record is also his first studio album, Indigo. Out of all three solo projects, Indigo is by far the most personal storytelling record. Through Indigo, RM created an \u201carchive to his twenties,\u201d where he expands again on his loneliness and bitterness, but this time, he also delves into themes like heartbreak and bewilderment. Indigo becomes an ode to all young adults in their twenties via its poignant unraveling of a superstar\u2019s innermost thoughts and feelings.\n\nSUGA/Agust D \u2014 Agust D (2016), D-2 (2020)\n\nBTS\u2019 main rapper Min Yoongi, also known as SUGA and Agust D \u2014 his solo persona \u2014 has currently two EPs out. Working as a composer and lyricist independently from a young age, the rapper finally released his own story through music in 2016 with Agust D, his eponymous debut mixtape. The EP comprises ten tracks, and it expands on his rise to stardom in contrast with his underground roots and influences. Agust D\u2019s hardcore rap also emphasizes his struggles with mental illness in a country where vulnerability is considered taboo, exploiting his duality by overcoming his separation between Agust D, Suga, and even Min Yoongi.\n\nHis second EP came four years later. D-2 englobes an idiosyncratic production, completely distinct from his past record. Whereas Agust D focused on the past, D-2 explored the rapper\u2019s feelings as a 28-year-old living in the present. The title song includes traditional South Korean percussion and storytelling, introducing its listeners to a modern rap progression mixed with kkwaenggwari elements.\n\nJ-Hope \u2014 Hope World (2018), Jack in the Box (2022)\n\nJung Hoseok, or J-Hope, is the second BTS member to include a studio album in his solo discography, alongside his debut EP. In spite of having no prior hip-hop knowledge before BTS, the rapper and singer boldly shared his own production and lyricism for the very first time through Hope World in 2018. This mixtape explores the life of Jung Hoseok, behind the J-Hope persona, in his daily life. In the EP, the rapper delves, through bouncing bass lines and R&B, into his wish to become a source of hope to those around him, while still showing his perspective as a human being behind his stardom.\n\nJack in the Box was the first studio album released after BTS\u2019 break announcement. The album includes an absolutely divergent production from his previous cheerful beats, incorporating the very first hints of grunge into the member\u2019s discography. Jack in the Box explores much harsher and more intense themes than his previous mixtape, encompassing issues like passion, ambition, insecurities, anxiety, and even englobing a critic to society through \u201cEqual Sign.\u201d\n\nSo far, only the three rappers have a record-extended repertoire under their belt. While every single member has released numerous non-profitable singles and even collaborations, the four vocalists have yet to release full-length studio albums. All the EPs and albums can be found on Spotify, and all of the vocalists\u2019 singles can be found on BTS Soundcloud or in each individual member\u2019s Spotify profile.\n\nAbout the author"}, {"url": "https://www.norden.org/en/person/sirid-stenberg", "page_content": "Our Vision 2030 The Nordic region will become the most sustainable and integrated region in the world in 2030.\n\nPolicy areas Get insight into areas where the Nordic countries work together.\n\nCurrent initiatives Keep up with the latest Nordic initiatives and campaigns.\n\nInternational co-operation Get insight into the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers\u2019 international activities.\n\nNordic Council prizes The Literature Prize, the Children and Young People\u2019s Literature Prize, the Music Prize, the Film Prize, and the Environment Prize.\n\nNordic Council cases Here you can gain insight into current issues under consideration by the Nordic Council as well as look at closed cases."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/sirid.stenberg/1861596", "page_content": "Sirid Stenberg Edit Profile\n\nassistant Faroese politician\n\nSiri\u00f0 Stenberg is a Faroese politician.\n\nEducation She finished her education as a nurse in 1994 and as a nurse in neonatalalogy in 1998 and as a nurse with special knowledge of children from 0-7 (Heilsufr\u00f8\u00f0ingur in Faroese, Sundhedsplejerske in Danish, a health care visitor who attends to and gives advice to the mothers and their small children in their homes).\n\nCareer Since 2001 she has worked in the children\"s health care in Su\u00f0uroy.

Both sides need to invest time, and embrace surprise and challenge.\n\nCenterbeam: MIT\u2019s iconic art\u2013science installation in 1977.Credit: Dietmar L\u00f6hrl/CAVS Special Collection, MIT\n\nExhilarating, challenging, enlightening, stimulating, inspiring, fun.\n\nThese were some of the words that Nature readers used to describe their experiences of art\u2013science collaborations in a series of articles on partnerships between artists and researchers. Nearly 40% of the roughly 350 people who responded to an accompanying poll said they had collaborated with artists; and almost all said they would consider doing so in future.\n\nSuch an encouraging result is not surprising. Public engagement has become essential to many research projects. Scientists are increasingly seeking out visual artists and designers to help them to communicate their work to new audiences. \u201cArtists help scientists reach a broader audience and make emotional connections that enhance learning,\u201d one respondent said. \u201cThe experience is very liberating for me, as a scientist,\u201d said another. \u201cThere\u2019s often a visual aspect to my science that generating and publishing data does not convey.\u201d\n\nOne example of how artists and scientists have together rocked the senses came last month when the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in Australia performed a reworked version of Antonio Vivaldi\u2019s The Four Seasons. They reimagined the 300-year-old score by injecting the latest climate prediction data for each season \u2014 provided by Monash University\u2019s Climate Change Communication Research Hub in Melbourne. The work was entitled The (Uncertain) Four Seasons, and variations of the score containing local data were sent to every major orchestra in the world. The performance was a creative call to action ahead of November\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK.\n\nHow to shape a productive scientist\u2013artist collaboration\n\nAnother example is how researchers are able to \u2018walk\u2019 inside cells by incorporating nanometre-scale images from super-resolution microscopy into virtual-reality software (A. Spark et al. Nature Methods 17, 1097\u20131099; 2020). Researchers are also deploying scientific methods to study many aspects of literature and music.\n\nBut a genuine partnership must be a two-way street. Fewer artists than scientists responded to the Nature poll; however, several respondents noted that artists do not simply assist scientists with their communication requirements. Nor should their work be considered only as an object of study \u2014 even if these are reasons why scientists seek opportunities to work with artists. The alliances are most valuable when scientists and artists have a shared stake in a project, are able to jointly design it and can critique each other\u2019s work. Such an approach can both prompt new research as well as result in powerful art.\n\nMore than half a century ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) opened its Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAVS) in Cambridge to explore the role of technology in culture. The centre was established during the Vietnam War, when many scientists in the United States were being criticized for working on defence contracts. Its founders believed that artists and scientists could, together, create a vision for a more humane world. They deliberately focused their projects around light \u2014 hence the \u2018visual studies\u2019 in the name. Light was a something that both artists and scientists had an interest in, and therefore could form the basis of collaboration, says Seth Riskin, a visual-arts researcher at the MIT Museum who previously worked at CAVS.\n\nHow the arts can help you to craft a successful research career\n\nAmong its many achievements, CAVS was responsible for Centerbeam, a 44-metre-long installation illustrating energy transfer. It included laser drawings against clouds of steam, holograms lit by mirrors tracking the Sun and huge nylon sculptures lifted into the air with helium-filled polyethylene tubing. As science and technology progressed, and divided into more sub-disciplines, the centre was simultaneously looking to a time when leading researchers could also be artists, writers and poets, and vice versa.\n\nNature\u2019s poll findings suggest that this trend is as strong as ever, but, to make a collaboration work, both sides need to be prepared to be surprised and challenged, to invest time in getting to know one another and to trust their different expertise. \u201cI enjoyed physics for its elegance and symmetry,\u201d a quantum physicist said in response to the poll. Their artist collaborator was drawn more to the messy reality of the process of science, which is not always reflected in popular science communication.\n\nThe reach of art\u2013science tie-ups needs to go beyond the necessary purpose of research communication, and participants must not fall into the trap of stereotyping each other. Artists and scientists alike are immersed in discovery and invention, and challenge and critique are core to both, too."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Siri%C3%B0_Stenberg", "page_content": "What we do.
