He used different colors, like blue and orange, to create paintings that were fun and exciting to look at.\n\nAll in all, Expressionism and Fauvism used complementary colors to express their emotions through vivid combinations that spoke directly to viewers\u2019 hearts.\n\nThe Importance of Color in Abstract Expressionism\n\nAbstract Expressionists made use of the power of color to create emotion-filled works.\n\nThe most important aspect of this art movement was the ability to express meaning through powerful colors, shapes, lines, and other gestures.\n\nArtists like Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko embraced bright hues like pinks, blues, and oranges to convey emotions \u2013 often affection or joy.\n\nRothko\u2019s No. 10 uses a complementary range of color spectrums, warm yellows and oranges and cool blues to draw in viewers and leave them feeling uplifted.\n\nJackson Pollock used many bright colors and different brush strokes to make his paintings exciting and eye-catching.\n\nAbstract Expressionists made art that was exciting to look at by using bright colors that made people feel different emotions.\n\nPop Art\u2019s Use of Primary Colors\n\nPop Art uses primary colors to express bold emotions in a modern, vibrant way.\n\nThe movement\u2019s most iconic works use the primary colors red, blue, and yellow to draw viewers in with bright, intense hues.\n\nFor example, Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s Drowning Girl uses cool blues and pinks together to create a feeling of fear and desperation.\n\nAndy Warhol\u2019s painting Campbell\u2019s Soup Cans is only made with primary colors. This makes people feel happy and remember their childhood.\n\nClaes Oldenburg is an artist who did something special. He made sculptures that were bigger than life and used bright colors like primary colors to make them stand out.\n\nPop Art\u2019s success can be attributed to its ability to effectively communicate complex emotions through the use of basic color schemes with a powerful effect.\n\nYou might also enjoy these art quotes.\n\nThe Role of Color in Marketing Design\n\nColor plays a vital role in marketing, as it has the power to evoke emotions and influence how users perceive products and messages.\n\nDesigners use color psychology to create a certain feeling when users interact with something they\u2019ve created.\n\nFor example, warm colors such as reds and oranges can create feelings of passion or excitement. Cool colors like blue or green often convey trustworthiness and dependability.\n\nIn marketing campaigns, colors are strategically used to draw attention to a product or message. Bright hues like yellow can make an item stand out from competitors, while muted tones can be favored for a more subtle approach.\n\nUltimately, color plays a vital role in any design project. Designers must use the right combination of colors to elicit the correct emotional response in their audience.\n\nLearn more about business colors for branding.\n\nColor Emotion In the Digital Art World\n\nThe digital art world has embraced color in a big way, using it to create stunning images with powerful emotional resonance.\n\nColor is used deliberately to bring out desired reactions, with some artists relying heavily on the power of color psychology to convey their message.\n\nFor example, warmer shades like orange and red can express energy, while cooler tones like violet or blue might invoke sadness or mystery.\n\nDifferent kinds of art look best with different colors. Digital art usually looks best with bright colors, while landscapes look better with softer, more gentle shades.\n\nTechnology has made it easier for artists to create more exciting art with different colors. There is no limit to the kinds of artwork they can make with the right mix of colors and feelings.\n\nMaking the Most of Color Psychology and Emotion\n\nColor is an essential element of art and design, as it has the power to evoke emotions in viewers.\n\nWhether you\u2019re creating digital artwork or marketing materials, consider how color can be used strategically to create a desired emotional response from your audience.\n\nYou can also learn more about why color is important."}, {"url": "https://www.verywellmind.com/color-psychology-2795824", "page_content": "Do you feel anxious in a yellow room? Does the color blue make you feel calm and relaxed? Artists and interior designers have long believed that color can dramatically affect moods, feelings, and emotions. \"Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions,\" the artist Pablo Picasso once remarked.\n\nColor is a powerful communication tool and can be used to signal action, influence mood, and even influence physiological reactions. Certain colors have been associated with physiological changes, including increased blood pressure, increased metabolism, and eyestrain.\n\nThis article discusses what color psychology means and how colors affect the mind and body. It also explores research on the effect of color and the psychological reactions people may experience.\n\nPress Play to Learn More About How Colors Affect the Mind and Body Hosted by Editor-in-Chief and therapist Amy Morin, LCSW, this episode of The Verywell Mind Podcast shares how colors influence the mind and body. Click below to listen now.\n\nFollow Now: Apple Podcasts / Spotify / Google Podcasts / Amazon Music\n\nWhat Is Color Psychology?\n\nColor psychology is the study of how different colors affect human mood and behavior. It explores how colors can influence emotional responses, as well as how responses to color are affected by factors such as age and cultural background.\n\nDifferent topics that are of interest in this area include:\n\nThe meanings of colors\n\nHow colors impact physiological responses\n\nEmotional reactions to color\n\nFactors that impact color preferences\n\nCultural differences in the meanings and associations of different colors\n\nWhether colors can impact mental health\n\nHow colors can influence behaviors\n\nWays that colors can be utilized to promote well-being\n\nHow colors can be used to improve safety and design more optimal home and work environments\n\n\n\nHistory of Color Psychology\n\nThe scientific exploration of color psychology is relatively new, but people have long been interested in the nature and impact of color. In ancient cultures, colors were often used to treat different conditions and influence emotions. They also played a role in different spiritual practices.\n\nIt was in 1666 that the English scientist Sir Isaac Newton discovered that when pure white light passes through a prism, it separates into all visible colors. Newton also found that each color is made up of a single wavelength and cannot be separated any further into other colors.\n\nFurther experiments demonstrated that light could be combined to form other colors. For example, red light mixed with yellow light creates an orange color. Some colors, such as green and magenta, cancel each other out when mixed, resulting in white light.\n\n\"Given the prevalence of color, one would expect color psychology to be a well-developed area,\" researchers Andrew Elliot and Markus Maier noted in a review of the existing research on the psychology of color. \"Surprisingly, little theoretical or empirical work has been conducted to date on color's influence on psychological functioning, and the work that has been done has been driven mostly by practical concerns, not scientific rigor.\"\n\n\n\nDespite the general lack of research in this area, color psychology has become a hot topic in marketing, art, design, and other areas.\n\nMuch of the evidence in this emerging area is anecdotal at best, but researchers and experts have made a few important discoveries and observations about the psychology of color and its effect on moods, feelings, and behaviors.\n\n\n\nThe Psychological Effects of Color\n\nWhy is color such a powerful force in our lives? What effects can it have on our bodies and minds? While perceptions of color are somewhat subjective, some color effects have universal meanings.\n\nColors in the red area of the color spectrum are known as warm colors and include red, orange, and yellow. These warm colors evoke emotions ranging from feelings of warmth and comfort to feelings of anger and hostility.\n\nColors on the blue side of the spectrum are known as cool colors and include blue, purple, and green. These colors are often described as calm, but can also call to mind feelings of sadness or indifference.\n\nSymbolic Color Meanings Symbolic meanings that are often associated with different colors: Red: Passion, excitement, love\n\nPink: Soft, reserved, earthy\n\nPurple: Mysterious, noble, glamorous\n\nBlue: Wisdom, hope, reason, peace\n\nGreen: Nature, growth, freshness\n\nYellow: Hope, joy, danger\n\nOrange: Warmth, kindness, joy\n\nWhite: Truth, indifference\n\nBlack: Noble, mysterious, cold\n\n\n\nOne 2020 study that surveyed the emotional associations of 4,598 people from 30 different countries found that people commonly associate certain colors with specific emotions. According to the study results:\n\nBlack : 51% of respondents associated black with sadness\n\n: 51% of respondents associated black with sadness White : 43% of people associated white with relief\n\n: 43% of people associated white with relief Red : 68% associated red with love\n\n: 68% associated red with love Blue : 35% linked blue to feelings of relief\n\n: 35% linked blue to feelings of relief Green : 39% linked green to contentment\n\n: 39% linked green to contentment Yellow : 52% felt that yellow means joy\n\n: 52% felt that yellow means joy Purple : 25% reported they associated purple with pleasure\n\n: 25% reported they associated purple with pleasure Brown : 36% linked brown to disgust\n\n: 36% linked brown to disgust Orange : 44% associated orange with joy\n\n: 44% associated orange with joy Pink: 50% linked pink with love\n\nThe study's researchers suggested that such results indicated that color-emotion associations appear to have universal qualities. These shared meanings may play an essential role in aiding communication.\n\nYour feelings about color are often deeply personal and rooted in your own experience or culture. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries.\n\nColor Psychology as Therapy\n\nSeveral ancient cultures, including the Egyptians and Chinese, practiced chromotherapy, or the use of colors to heal. Chromotherapy is sometimes referred to as light therapy or colorology.\n\nColorology is still used today as a holistic or alternative treatment. In this treatment:\n\nRed is used to stimulate the body and mind and to increase circulation.\n\nis used to stimulate the body and mind and to increase circulation. Yellow is thought to stimulate the nerves and purify the body.\n\nis thought to stimulate the nerves and purify the body.

Blue is believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain.\n\nis believed to soothe illnesses and treat pain. Indigo shades are thought to alleviate skin problems.\n\nWhile more research is needed, a 2020 study suggested that chromotherapy may be an effective way to help combat feelings of compassion fatigue and post-traumatic stress in intensive care unit nurses.\n\nModern Research on Color Psychology\n\nMost psychologists view color therapy with skepticism and point out that the supposed effects of color are often grossly exaggerated. Colors also have different meanings in different cultures.\n\nHowever, the mood-altering effects of color may only be temporary. A blue room may initially cause feelings of calm, but the effect dissipates after a short period of time.\n\nHowever, existing research has found that color can impact people in a variety of surprising ways:\n\nWhile-colored pills are associated with greater pain relief., while red pills are associated with having greater stimulant properties.\n\nare associated with greater pain relief., while red pills are associated with having greater stimulant properties. Red causes people to react with greater speed and force, something that might be helpful during athletic activities according to researchers.\n\ncauses people to react with greater speed and force, something that might be helpful during athletic activities according to researchers. Black-uniformed players are more likely to receive penalties in competitive sporting events.\n\nAdditional Research Is Still Needed\n\nInterest in the subject of color psychology is growing, but there remain several unanswered questions. How do color associations develop? How powerful is the influence of these associations on real-world behavior?\n\nCan color be used to increase worker productivity or workplace safety? What colors have an impact on consumer behavior? Do certain personality types prefer specific colors? As researchers continue to explore such questions, we may soon learn more about color's impact on human psychology.\n\nZena O'Connor, a faculty member in the Department of Architecture, Design, and Planning at the University of Sydney, suggests that people should be wary of many of the claims they see about the psychology of color.\n\n\"Many of these claims lack substantiation in terms of empirical support, exhibit fundamental flaws (such as causal oversimplification and subjective validation), and may include factoids presented as facts,\" O'Connor explains. \"In addition, such claims often refer to outdated research without referring to current research findings.\"\n\nRecap More research is needed to understand the mental and physical effects of color. Universal associations may exist, but many other factors, including personal preferences and individual experiences, also play an important role in your unique emotional and behavioral response.\n\nColor Can Influence Performance\n\nStudies have also shown that certain colors can have an impact on performance. No one likes to see a graded test covered in red ink, but one study found that seeing the color red before taking an exam actually hurt test performance.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nWhile the color red is often described as threatening, arousing or exciting, many previous studies on the impact of the color red have been largely inconclusive. The study found, however, that exposing students to the color red prior to an exam has been shown to have a negative impact on test performance.\n\nIn the first of the six experiments described in the study, 71 U.S. colleges students were presented with a participant number colored either red, green or black prior to taking a five-minute test.\n\nThe results revealed that students who were presented with the red number before taking the test scored more than 20% lower than those presented with the green and black numbers.\n\nColor and Consumer Purchases\n\nColor psychology suggests that various shades can have various effects, from boosting our moods to causing anxiety. But could the color of the products you purchase ever say something about your personality? For example, could the color of the car you buy somehow relate to some underlying personality traits or quirks?\n\nWhen buying items, your color preferences might say something about the image you are trying to project. Color preferences, from the clothes you wear to the car you drive, can sometimes make a statement about how we want other people to perceive us. Other factors, such as age and gender, can also influence our color choices.\n\nWhite : As many of our readers have suggested, the color white can feel fresh and clean. The color is often used to evoke a sense of youth and modernity.\n\n: As many of our readers have suggested, the color white can feel fresh and clean.

Gray: The experts suggest that people who drive gray cars don't want to stand out and instead prefer something more subtle.\n\n\n\nOf course, our color selections are often influenced by price, selection, and other practical concerns. Not only that, but color preferences can also change over time.\n\n\n\nA person might prefer brighter, more attention-getting colors when they are younger, but find themselves drawn to more traditional colors as they grow older. The personality of the buyer can play an important role in color selection, but buyers are often heavily influenced by factors such as price as well as availability.\n\nFor example, purchasing a white vehicle might be less about wanting people to think that you are young and modern and more about the climate you live in; people who live in hot climates typically prefer light-colored vehicles over dark ones.\n\n\n\nA Word From Verywell\n\nColor can play an important role in conveying information, creating certain moods, and even influencing the decisions people make. Color preferences also exert an influence on the objects people choose to purchase, the clothes they wear, and the way they adorn their environments.\n\nPeople often select objects in colors that evoke certain moods or feelings, such as selecting a car color that seems sporty, futuristic, sleek, or trustworthy. Room colors can also be used to evoke specific moods, such as painting a bedroom a soft green to create a peaceful mood.\n\nSo what's the bottom line? Experts have found that while color can have an influence on how we feel and act, these effects are subject to personal, cultural, and situational factors. More scientific research is needed to gain a better understanding of color psychology."}, {"url": "https://www.tate.org.uk/art/teaching-resource/colour-and-shape", "page_content": "Introduction\n\nAll art makes use of shape and colour in some way. Your eyes can be drawn to certain parts of an artwork when shape and colour is used correctly. Artists use colour to express themselves and aim to make you feel something when you look at it. Start discussions about shape and colour with your students by looking at and creating art. This resource is most suitable for KS1 students.\n\nColour\n\nHow is colour used in art? Frank Bowling is an artist who believes that colour is as important in telling a story as the subject he paints. Bowling layers colours and uses splashes, drips and smudges to create different effects. His mainly uses colours, as opposed to objects and figures, to create emotion. In his painting Whose Afraid of Barney Newman Bowling uses bright colours and blurred edges. Does his painting look like anything to you? Did you know these are the colours of the Guyanese flag? Arthur Hughes, who was part of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, used colour in a different way to Bowling. The Pre-Raphaelites believed the object was as important as colour. They used colour to reflect the world around them as closely as possible. Let's explore the different ways colour is used.\n\nRed\n\nGreen\n\nBLUE\n\nYELLOW\n\nMulti-colour\n\nLets discuss! Here are some questions you can ask your class to start a discussion about colour: What do different colours make you think of?\n\nHow do the colours make you feel?\n\nWhich colour combinations you think go together?\n\nWhat kind of stories can be told through colour?\n\nShape\n\nFrom sharp corners, curved edges and towering sculptures, shape is used throughout art. Geometric shapes, like squares and triangles, are mainly found in objects made by humans, like houses, cars and factories. Irregular shapes are more likely to come from nature. Imagine a leaf or a shell. How do you think artists could use them differently to tell a story? Frank Stella's Hyena Stomp (below) uses sharp edges and corners. He even became known as a 'hard edged artist'. Gillian Aryes used layers of different shapes on top of another. In her artwork The Colour That Was There (in the slideshow above) she uses a rough square as a background. She then mixes circles, rectangles, curved lines and bright colours to give her work depth. Below are more examples of different shapes in artwork. Squares\n\nTriangles\n\nCircles\n\nThree-dimensional shapes\n\nLet's discuss\n\nWhat kind of emotions or personalities can shapes hold?\n\nDo some shapes look more masculine than feminine?

Today, I want to go back to basics and talk about how all the things we see can be associated with simple shapes and how the use of these shapes affects the outcome of our strategies.\n\nAnything and everything, from elements in a photograph to a certain typography can be analyzed in terms of shape. All the bits and pieces inside our presentations, infographics and visual strategies are telling their own story. It is up to us to put these pieces together in a way that creatively and effectively tells our story.

Try It for Free\n\nConscious Combination of Shapes and Color\n\nWhen using shapes in your graphics and designs, you will most definitely be using color as well. The combination of certain shapes and colors already have a defined connotation in our subconscious. For example, a yellow circle usually represents the sun, while a red half-circle can represent a slice of watermelon. Unless you are trying to send a direct message with your composition, shapes and colors are mostly an accessory and should be considered as such.\n\nUsing Shapes to Create Something Else\n\nYou can also use shapes as elements of a larger image. A group of violet circles, for example, can be combined to form a bunch of grapes; a white rectangle and two white triangles can come together to form an envelope; a few squares and rectangles can make a house. All these possibilities and more are out there for you to play with. But you must think about what your end goal is.\n\nDo you want to design your own branded icons? Or create your own backgrounds? Do you want to combine your photos into a collage that represents something, like the shape of a fish, for example? Shapes are your best allies for these kinds of creations. All you have to do is play with them until you arrive at a composition you like.\n\nUsing Shapes as Accessories\n\nFor designs like presentations, infographics and social media graphics, shapes are more commonly used as accessories or complements. This doesn\u2019t mean that they are less important\u2014on the contrary! As accessories, they say more on their own.\n\nHow we place our accessory shapes can tell many different stories. There is a psychology behind shapes that you may not even be aware of. There are emotions and feelings evoked by certain shapes, inspired by cultural conventions and forms seen in nature. We cannot create without shapes. Even the paper we write or draw on is a shape; our screen is a shape!\n\nLet\u2019s go further into understanding shapes and their (not so) hidden messages.\n\nGeometric, Organic and Abstract Shapes\n\nAccess thousands of shapes, icons and symbols for use in your graphics. Try It for Free\n\nAll possible shapes fall into three main categories: geometric, organic and abstract.\n\nGeometric\n\nGeometric shapes are the ones we first learn about as little kids. They're the simplest, most common shapes of all: squares, circles, triangles and their derivatives, such as rectangles, ovals and polygons. Most geometric shapes are symmetrical and instantly recognizable, but they also convey silent messages, which I will cover later in this post.\n\nOrganic\n\nOrganic shapes are those that represent things we know about nature and life around us. The most common organic shapes are plant-based, like flowers and leaves. Another kind of organic shapes are those that represent forms we can create ourselves, like paint splatters or watercolor blobs. These kinds of shapes are mostly asymmetric and their kinds of lines can vary.\n\nAbstract\n\nAbstract shapes are depictions of real things without being exact representations. The icons we see in web design, our phones and in street signs are abstract shapes that we are quite used to seeing and can easily recognize. A great example of an abstract shape is a stick figure, which represents a person. Symbols are also considered abstract shapes.\n\nSquares and Rectangles\n\nThe shapes we come across the most in designs and our everyday lives are squares and rectangles, in both horizontal and vertical layouts. Street signs, shop signs, social media headers, blog headers, business cards, sheets of paper\u2014all are rectangles.\n\nThe familiarity of squares and rectangles makes them easy to use as the base of a design or as a frame. Squares and rectangles make us feel safe and contained. They give a sense of stability and assurance but also easily fall to the background, and the feelings they convey are mostly subliminal.\n\nThe Rule of Thirds\n\nUsing squares and rectangles as the base of a composition is good practice. Experimenting with the way rectangles and squares can be scaled and put together can serve as a visual exercise when designing a new graphic. There is one very important design practice called the rule of thirds. It\u2019s all about how rectangles and lines control the balance in any composition.\n\nThe best way to visualize the rule of thirds is as a grid. The best websites are designed and developed following a grid. Graphic designers use grids for better composition. Architects use grids for better measurements. What are grids composed of? Squares and rectangles (and sometimes triangles if you want to use a more complex perspective grid).\n\nThe rule of thirds is essentially a grid that separates your canvas space into nine equal sections. The idea behind this is that the human eye has a natural direction in which it prefers to move from object to object. The most important areas are the intersection points, starting at the top left and then either the one on the immediate right or straight down. The bottom right corner is the intersection point that attracts the least attention.\n\nRELATED: 12 Visual Hierarchy Principles Every Non-Designer Needs to Know\n\nCircles\n\nIn design, circles have different uses for different purposes. In logo design, for example, circles are the most common and widely seen shape or background outline for a logo. In websites, they are mostly used as buttons and small icons. Why is it that we see so many circles used as accessory shapes in websites, graphics and even infographics? The reason behind this is that circles are very noticeable, and quite powerful.\n\nCircles represent wholeness, a natural sense of completion. When we think of things shaped as circles in the world around us, there are so many things that we can name.\n\nSome things that circles can represent:\n\nThe Sun\n\nThe Moon\n\nThe Earth\n\nAny planet\n\nA ball\n\nAn orange\n\nA ring or band\n\nA smiley face\n\nButtons\n\nTake into consideration the power of a circle and how it can affect your designs. Circles can represent constant movement, such as spinning or rolling. The outline of a circle can serve as a band or ring representing a cycle or continuing action. A circle can represent a hole punched out on a page. A circle with a subtle shadow effect can look like a sticker or button that has been \u201cplaced\u201d over the rest of the design.\n\nTriangles\n\nTriangles have two meanings depending on their position. When pointing up, they represent stability and power, when pointing down they become unstable. The triangle is primarily a masculine shape, but when inverted it also represents female reproduction. In spirituality, triangles represent the union of body, mind, and spirit.\n\nIn design, skinny triangles can be used instead of arrows or pointers. Smaller triangles can be used as shapes in a collage with an interlocking composition or mosaic effect. Larger triangles are more noticeable, so you should take into consideration their meaning before using them in larger sizes. It is always best to use triangles that sit comfortably on a base or with a point facing to the right, conveying a message of moving forward.\n\nCreate your own blog graphics in minutes with this drag-and-drop tool. Try It for Free\n\nTriangles we see in everyday life:\n\nThe \u201cplay\u201d symbol\n\nThe \u201cfast forward\u201d and \u201creverse\u201d symbols\n\nPyramids\n\nMountains\n\nPennants\n\nPizza slices\n\nTriangles can also be used to break from the traditional, square design. They can be put together in countless ways to create all sorts of dynamic designs, such as the one below.\n\nPentagons, Hexagons and Octagons\n\nPentagons, hexagons and octagons are geometric shapes with five, six and eight sides respectively. These are the most commonly used polygons with more than four sides. There are lots more of course, but these three are the most versatile for creating graphics.\n\nLet\u2019s review what each of these shapes are reminiscent of in our daily lives to best understand how they can be used in our designs.\n\nPentagons\n\nThe Pentagon Building in the US\n\nThe black shapes on a soccer ball\n\nSome streets signs. For example: Children / School Crossing\n\nSymbol for house or dwelling\n\nHexagons\n\nBolts\n\nFloor tiles\n\nThe white shapes on a soccer ball\n\nSections of a beehive\n\nThe shapes formed by fence wire\n\nOctagons\n\nStop signs\n\nOpen umbrellas\n\nWindows\n\nTiles\n\nCandles\n\nUsing Polygons on Their Own\n\nA few simple ways to use any of these polygons is to insert text inside of them or cut out images as shapes. You can use these techniques in blog post header images, Pinterest pins, Instagram graphics, YouTube thumbnails or presentation slides.\n\nUsing any of these polygons instead of a regular rectangle or square will give your graphic a different feel from the usual. Understanding the message behind each of these shapes is key to choosing the best one for your brand or message. Use the list above to think about what these shapes remind you of and consider how this affects your design.\n\nUsing Polygons as Interlocking Shapes\n\nThese shapes can also be used as puzzle pieces to create a larger composition and organize information, such as in an infographic. With hexagons, you can design a beehive style composition with analogous colors. With pentagons and octagons you can design something similar in either horizontal, vertical and even diagonal directions.\n\nPentagons, hexagons and octagons can also be separated into smaller shapes such as triangles to create a progression with a visually circular motion or a visualization similar to a pie chart.\n\nNatural Shapes\n\nNatural or organic shapes represent things and animals found in the natural world, such as leaves, flowers, trees, or man-made things like paint splatter and ink droplets.\n\nYou should definitely use these shapes if your design is related to the environment or ecology. These kinds of shapes also work great for graphics about the great outdoors, like hiking, camping and the like. If your business has to do with flowers, then you can go beyond just using images of real flowers by using natural shapes as accessories for your graphics.\n\nYou can use natural shapes on their own or as part of a larger composition, such as in the examples below. But keep in mind that these kinds of shapes have a clear meaning and message\u2014they are not very subliminal at all.\n\nSymbols and Icons\n\nSymbols and icons are kinds of abstract shapes. They can represent ordinary things and they can also carry a higher symbolism, either religious, political or cultural. Symbols and icons are especially useful when creating graphics because they convey messages quickly.\n\nThe difference between symbols and shapes is that regular shapes can be used in greater quantity within a design, while too many symbols can be overwhelming and can create confusion. Keep the use of symbols to a minimum, and if you do use them, choose them wisely.\n\nIcons are often seen in infographic design to minimize the use of text and call attention to certain key messages. But you need to choose icons carefully in order to stay on brand. Make sure you change the color scheme of your icons to fit your brand and only use one style of icon within the same infographic.\n\nRELATED: How to Select and Use Icons in Your Infographics\n\nStars\n\nBesides geometric shapes, stars can also be considered symbols as they are often used in religious depictions and have a variety of connotations. Stars are memorable and often symbolize notoriety and importance. Our eyes will always be drawn to a star (especially if it\u2019s yellow or gold) before any other shape.\n\nStars are great shapes for framing sale prices, special information about a product or promotion, a discount or a bonus. Yellow stars can remind us of the golden stars we received as students, while blue stars will bring to mind first-place ribbons. Use stars accordingly to convey the proper message.\n\nAccess thousands of shapes, symbols and icons for use in your graphics. Try It for Free\n\nWhat do we associate stars with?\n\nFive-pointed stars with the point facing up:\n\nGolden star stickers\n\nStars in the sky\n\nPrizes and awards\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame Stars\n\nMovie stars\n\nChristmas star\n\nArrows\n\nArrows come in all different types of designs and styles, each with a unique vibe. Bold, solid arrows will convey more strength than thin or hollow arrows. Squiggly arrows can give your design a playful air. Arrows can be quite small, for use in bullet lists, or quite large to house text inside them. Concentric arrows, in triangle or circular forms, can be used to represent cycles and processes. The international symbol for recycling is a triangle made out of arrows.\n\nDirection\n\nAn arrow\u2019s greatest purpose is to convey direction. Using arrows can help your viewer follow a path of information from one part of your graphic to another. You can also use arrows in \u201cbefore-and-after\u201d graphics or other sorts of transformations. Like with icons, it\u2019s best to stay on brand and use a consistent style of arrow throughout your design. If you use hand-drawn arrows in one infographic, you should not combine them with thick, blocky arrows.\n\nShapes and Symbols of the Digital Generation\n\nEmojis\n\nUsing emojis in graphics is quickly becoming a trend that doesn\u2019t seem like it will go away very soon. If your clientele is comprised mostly of young people, you should look into using emojis in your graphics. Millennials text using emojis instead of words. Why not tap into that and use it to your advantage?\n\nPin Drops\n\nPin drops are the shapes we have come to know via Google maps and other location apps. You can use customized pin drops in your graphics and maps if you have a travel company, for example. Visme has an entire section of pin drops in its icon library!\n\nStaying on Brand with Shapes\n\nOne thing we need to keep in mind when using shapes to create graphics for our visual marketing strategy is that we should always stay on brand. When creating a visual style guide, you should establish a selection of shapes that are to be used for all brand graphics. Try not to use shapes willy-nilly every time you create a new graphic.\n\nIf your squares and rectangles always have rounded corners, keep it that way. If you use octagons to frame text, then always use octagons.\n\nThink of your readers, clients and followers. They will remember your brand better if they can say something like, \u201cthat brand with the cool hexagon,\u201d or \u201cthat brand with the concentric arrows.\u201d Keeping a conscious consistency is key to staying true to your visual identity.\n\nYour Turn\n\nFree visual content tools such as Visme come with vast icon libraries, which include everything from geometric and natural shapes to icons and symbols. You can also change the color scheme of your shapes to make it easier to stay on brand.\n\nYou can take it a for a test drive here and share your unique creations with me below. Happy designing!"}, {"url": "https://visme.co/blog/geometric-patterns/", "page_content": "Geometric patterns are a collection of shapes, repeating or altered to create a cohesive design. While you have the shape meanings down, you might not know where to start. Here, we\u2019ve listed 40 great examples to help jumpstart your design ideas, with tips on how to apply them.\n\nLet's dive in!\n\nThe Psychology of Shapes\n\nDifferent shapes can evoke different meanings. According to Siddanth Pillai, the most common shapes\u2014rectangles, circles, triangles, rhombuses, and hexagons\u2014can be broken down into something like this:\n\nRectangles/Squares: Balance and Tradition\n\nCircles: Infinity, Protection, and Femininity\n\nTriangles: Stability, Energy, and Aggression\n\nRhombus: Vibrant and Contemporary\n\nHexagon: Unity and Balance\n\nCombining these shapes in different ways can create entirely new meanings. For example, creating something out of rectangles and triangles could emphasize a call to return to tradition.\n\nBut maybe you don\u2019t want to do something complex; maybe you\u2019d just like to use shapes here and there to give your site or product a little extra vitality, something that makes it stand out and look more professional. If so, geometric patterns might be for you.\n\n1 Use patterns to create images.\n\nSimple shapes, on their own, can be appealing; using a variety of shapes to create a whole image, however, can work even better. Liam Brazer\u2019s Landshape illustrates this well, using various shapes to create a vibrant landscape. Keep in mind what kind of shapes will work well for your subject, and you can create something spectacular.\n\n2 Play with asymmetry.\n\nNot all geometric patterns have to be symmetrical; sometimes creating something where shapes and lines differ across the board can create a striking effect. This poster illustrates the concept well, including mismatched overlays and triangles across both sides to create something more unique.\n\n3 Combine patterns with photos.\n\nGeometric patterns can be a great, creative way to spice up ordinary photos. For example, Sorry Colour takes a variety of photos and pastes them into shapes. The collage ultimately offers an entirely different, unique experience, giving the images more personality than if they were displayed alone.\n\n4 Use lighting and shadows creatively.\n\nShadows and highlights can be used to enhance shapes\u2014and sometimes create them, as shown by Seth Nickerson. Test what you can do with shadows in your own patterns, from making an almost 3D shape, to drawing attention to certain parts of the image.\n\n5 Connect shapes in unique ways.\n\nWe\u2019ve already explored how shapes can create images; exploring how those shapes connect can create new and interesting effects. For example, Work Hard uses a variety of geometric shapes, and creates a flowing image by connecting them in different ways\u2014for example, connecting the edges of the title and the shape for the individual\u2019s head.\n\n6 Make a collage.\n\nTry making a collage out of different shapes\u2014something that guides viewers and makes your pattern easier on the eyes. Neo Lab, for example, uses diamonds of varying sizes, connected by their sides.\n\n7 Use diagonals.\n\nDiagonals create a clear path for the eye to follow, offering the bonus of a cohesive design. Finnish Summer is a wonderful example, using diagonal patterns to create a beautiful juxtaposition of images and colors.\n\n8 Create isometric patterns.\n\nIsometric patterns\u2014or patterns that appear to be three dimensional\u2014can really make an image pop, if used correctly. Isometric Exhibition offers a great example, using hard colors to create the illusion that the shapes pop off the page. Used sparingly and creatively, this can draw attention to specific items or words.\n\n9 Create patterns with font.\n\nIf you want to really stretch your creativity, try using the typeface itself to create your patterns. Next Level, for example, uses a variety of triangles and hard lines to create a jagged, edgy effect. Creating patterns this way can help with whatever tone you might like for your site or product.\n\n10 Play with symmetry.\n\nCreate your own geometric designs with this DIY tool. Try It for Free\n\nWhile asymmetry creates a more free-flowing, fun look, symmetry can be used in geometric patterns to create something more elegant. ICP showcases this perfectly, especially on the cover, where the top half of the image perfectly mirrors the bottom.\n\n11 Use patterns within patterns.\n\nIf you want something more complex, including geometric patterns within already existing shapes can be the way to go. The top left and bottom right example on this page are great examples, one using squares to house patterns, the other using circles.\n\n12 Keep it simple.\n\nConversely, not everything has to be complex\u2014simple shapes can be just as appealing. Astrobrights Thank You Cards are great examples, using only a few shapes and lines to create appealing images.\n\n13 Think about different ways to use lines.\n\nLines are the most basic elements of any shape; using them creatively can help create new effects, and can create a nice flow between images and information.\n\nEuropa is one great example, using simple lines to create a candle\u2014including the melting wax! Planetary Folklore is another, creating a circle within the lines. Experiment with simple lines, and see what you might be able to create.\n\n14 Create a theme.\n\nPatterns on their own are great; patterns used to connect images are even better, especially when those patterns all relate to one another.\n\nTake ADMCi, for example; the images all have a connection through similar colors and patterns that line their borders. Choosing a pattern, and applying it appropriately, can make formerly disparate subjects connected, and can identify products as \u201cyours.\u201d\n\n15 Use gradients.\n\nEveryone loves a good color scheme; geometric gradients can enhance that, making a gradient background or image pop.\n\nCarnival, for example, uses simple gradients between shapes, in some cases making the shapes almost blend together, and in others making them stand out even more.\n\n16 Create characters.\n\nIf geometric patterns can create images, then why not take it a step further and actually create a character with them?\n\nCubist Superheroes uses patterns to form already-familiar individuals, but you\u2019re not required to stick to existing characters. Why not try making a mascot from simple geometric shapes, and creating a simple guide from them, and see where it takes you?\n\n17 Combine several different images.\n\nShapes can be used to combine several different images together\u2014in ways to may both be expected and unexpected.\n\nFor example, Jelle Martens combines several different landscapes to create interesting collages. Experiment with what images might work well together\u2014and how they might change the image as a whole\u2014and use different shapes to make it all come together.\n\n18 Emulate an effect with shapes.\n\nShapes can be incredibly effective if used to resemble certain actions or consequences. For example, Triangle uses a bunch of\u2014you guessed it\u2014triangles to replicate the effect of shattered glass. Using shapes like this can add meaning and vibrancy to images; at the very least, it creates a startling picture.\n\n19 Create a background.\n\nIf you want something a little more subtle, try sticking to a simple geometric background, such as the one found here. These can add a little excitement to a website or presentation, without being too obvious and distracting.\n\n20 Create overlapping shapes.\n\nCreate your own geometric designs with this DIY tool. Try It for Free\n\nSometimes, all it takes is a simple trick to create complexity\u2014for example, overlapping two shapes, illustrated with Wanderlust. The image only includes two hexagons, but the overlap makes it look more complex and refined. Experiment with how different shapes overlap, and see what might work for you.\n\n21 Relate patterns to the subject.\n\nTry to give your pattern a purpose by relating it directly to the subject. For example, La Fete du Citron a Menton uses a leaf pattern to surround a lemon, reflecting the subject matter.\n\n22 Use patterns in the letters.\n\nYou can create patterns within the letters, if creating patterns with the letters themselves is too busy for you.\n\nFor example, including simple lines on the letter\u2019s side. A simple tutorial for use with Adobe Illustrator can be found here.\n\n23 Use a pattern to alter images.\n\nYou can use patterns to alter parts of an already existing image. Geometric Photography, for example, uses shapes to shift around where certain pieces of the image are. Shifting different parts of an image can create a different effect, and can create something quite original.\n\n24 Choose colors that work together.\n\nWhenever using colors with geometric patterns, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have ones that work well together\u2014especially if they happen to be on shapes that border each other.\n\nThe second background on this page is a great example, combining deep green and orange for a serious, professional look. Poor color choice can be distracting, so brush up on color theory and test how different colored shapes look against each other.\n\n25 Use shapes that enhance the experience.\n\nFind shapes that fit and flow well together, and that create a more seamless whole, rather than something that seems thrown together. Ultra\u2019s a wonderful example, with each shape connecting to one another as you scroll down the page.\n\n26 Create unique effects.\n\nYou can use a lot of different styles and shapes to create something completely your own. For example, you can use shapes that create the illusion of a reflection, such as in this case. Combining different shapes, lighting, and colors can produce different effects and illusions, and gives you a lot of material to work with.\n\n27 Create a border.\n\nA border is a good way to enhance an image with shapes, without it being too distracting. Take Zeppe, for example, which uses a geometric pattern to focus on its name.\n\n28 Add simple animation.\n\nWith technology, we have the benefit of enhancing various geometric patterns for the internet\u2014like, for example, adding simple, alternating animation between two geometric patterns.\n\nNoir is a great example, as it uses a simple GIF to switch between one set of lines and another, creating the illusion of motion.\n\n29 Make it subtle.\n\nNot everything has to be obvious; subtle shapes can be just as effective, as illustrated by Ita\u00fa Internacional, which has shapes that nearly blend into the background. This flow makes for a more professional look, while still adding some creativity.\n\n30 Use patterns to segment information.\n\nPatterns are a great way to separate and categorize information, making it easier for viewers to find.\n\nRenov\u00e1veis, for example, places each block of information between diagonal lines. Nasty Creatures takes a slightly different approach, with each link being found in a separate blob of the \u201cmonster.\u201d\n\n31 Create hand-drawn patterns.\n\nTraditional art appeals to nostalgia, and allows you to create something a bit more personal, such as with these black-and-white vectors.\n\n32 Use patterns to highlight certain elements.\n\nPatterns and lines are quite effective at drawing the eye to certain elements. Oli Lisher, for example, uses lines to draw attention to the word \u201cportfolio\u201d and then boxes in word examples. Think about what elements in your work you\u2019d like to highlight, and use shapes to lead the eye to them.\n\n33 Combine several patterns.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to stick to one pattern\u2014using multiple makes the image more engaging. Showreel is a great example, using a variety of circles, splatters, and other shapes throughout their site.\n\n34 Choose uncommonly used shapes.\n\nNo one says you have to stick to the standard circles, squares, and triangles; in fact, a design might work better using less traditional shapes.\n\nFenix Music, for example, uses speech bubbles and lightning bolts to highlight certain elements, a design which works better due to the connection to the subject matter.\n\n35 Create a \u201cweb\u201d between shapes.\n\nLines are great at drawing the eye to elements; why not use them to create a web between different subjects, like Kikk Festival does? Use it to make connections between several subjects, make a more appealing design, or something else entirely.\n\n36 Limit complex patterns.\n\nComplex patterns are great, but too many can be overwhelming. Fiore provides an interesting example: They use highly-detailed plants as their pattern, with some of the more appealing designs being limited to small spaces. Know how and where to use your pattern, and you\u2019ll be more likely to keep your viewers\u2019 attention.\n\n37 Make it good in black and white.\n\nNot every pattern needs color; keeping it black and white can be just as appealing, and can make a pattern more widely applicable. Look at Helvetimart\u2014the pattern looks great without color, making the latter unnecessary.\n\n38 Incorporate real-life elements.\n\nIf you want something that screams \u201cpersonal,\u201d try including geometric patterns that you see in your everyday workplace. Take Yamaha, for example; the pattern on their website matches the pattern on their building.\n\n39 Accent other material.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to leave the pattern on certain subjects\u2014you can branch across various products, like Amie Bakery does, to make the pattern more recognizable.\n\n40 Use patterns sparingly.\n\nProbably the simplest tip, but one of the easiest to forget: less is more. Geometric patterns don\u2019t need to be plastered all over your page.\n\nThe Tea Factory is a great example of geometric patterns done well, keeping them limited to their header. Limit use to avoid overwhelming a viewer and to give the patterns more impact.\n\nStart Using Your Own Geometric Patterns\n\nWhat are some awesome geometric patterns you\u2019ve seen?

Can you use a bright color palette in any design? How can you incorporate a bright color palette into your designs?\n\nCover Image Source: Pexels\n\nYou will find the answers to these questions and more in this article, so keep on reading.\n\nThe Benefits of Using Bright Colors\n\nBright Colors Increase Readability and Legibility\n\nAs a designer, making the copy in your design as readable and legible as possible is crucial.\n\nAny one-liners or company names you add to your design must be easy to read, and bright colors tend to catch a viewer's eye.\n\nThe typeface you choose is also essential, as you need to make sure the letters are distinguishable.\n\nBut sometimes it's hard to make all design elements work together while still making the text visible.\n\nHere\u2019s when bright colors come into the picture. Using a bright-colored background will instantly increase readability and visibility. You can also use bright colors for the typography to make the letters pop.\n\nHowever, working with a high level of color contrast may be tricky at times. You have to be careful with the contrast levels of your design so that the bright colors do not \u201cbackfire.\u201d We recommend you use a mild contrast level and \u201csave\u201d high contrasting colors only when highlighting some design elements.\n\nBright Colors Make Your Design Recognizable\n\nBold, bright colors are easier to remember, because the human brain reacts automatically to these colors.\n\nThat's why some companies apply bold colors or bright colors to their branded items and even their logo design.\n\nTo double down on this advantage, if you use a bright color palette in your logo, you should keep the same color scheme on your website and mobile app. This will also create a sense of consistency and make your brand even more recognizable.\n\nUsing bright colors in your logo and other design elements increases the chances that your logo or any other design will stand out from the rest. However, not every company can use bright colors in their logo design, website, mobile apps, etc.\n\nA detailed study of the market and the target audience has to be conducted in advance so that the preferences of your target audience match what you are offering.\n\nBright Colors Can Help Set the Mood and Stimulate Viewers\u2019 Energy\n\nWhen you use bright colors, you're not just making your design pop.\n\nYou are also setting the mood and atmosphere for anyone that looks at it. Several studies on color psychology have found that the human brain will \u201cread\u201d colors even if we don't fully notice them.\n\nColors matter, because every color conveys a specific type of emotional energy.\n\nColor brightness and contrast matter as well. So use bright colors wisely, depending on what kind of mood you want to create for your audience.\n\nBut how do you make sure that you convey the right tone and stimulate the proper energy? This is where color meaning comes into play. Each color has a unique meaning. All the colors of the rainbow have their own meaning as well.\n\nBright Colors Can Make Your Brand Look Instantly Trendy\n\nThere is no denying that bright colors are associated with trendy, modern looks.\n\nWebsites that use bright colors, vivid colors, and a modern color palette are instantly recognizable and grab your attention in no time.\n\nTech giants such as Apple have also caught on to this trend.\n\nSuppose you look at the latest iPhone colors, iPhone protective covers, and Apple\u2019s website. You will likely notice that the company mainly uses a bright color palette and a pastel color palette.\n\nBoth of these palettes have been widely used in architecture, home decor, fashion design in the last decade. The popularity of these eye-catching colors is only growing, and we are here for it.\n\nApple\u2019s logo is one of the most famous logos out there, and its official colors are black and grey. However, this detail did not stop Apple from being creative with its new iPhones and its latest products. The colorful website also matches the new colors of its latest products, making the brand look consistent everywhere.\n\nIf you already have a logo or design concept that uses neutral palettes or muted shades, you can still play around with bright colors for your product packaging or design. If bright colors may seem too much to your taste, you can still add just a touch of bright color, and it would still make your brand trendy and \u201cin style.\u201d\n\nCan You Use a Bright Color Palette in Any Design?\n\nTechnically? Yes. Realistically? Not really.\n\nDepending on your project, a bright color palette can make or break your design. You have to evaluate whether the bright color palette of your choice works well with the mood and feel you want to convey through your design.\n\nSometimes, a bright color palette may be just the thing you need to spice up your designs. Other times, you might have to re-evaluate the purpose of your design and decide whether an entire bright color palette or just a touch of bright colors will work best in that particular case.\n\nIn which way can you incorporate a bright color palette into your designs?\n\nThere are endless ways to incorporate a bright color palette into your designs. Here are just a few examples where a bright color palette can save your day.\n\n1. Adding Bright Color in Unexpected Places\n\nBright color added where the viewer least expects it feeds into the element of surprise that can instantly grab people\u2019s attention.\n\nIn the example above, the entire design is black and white, except for the peeled banana.\n\nNot only has the designer decided to leave the inside of the banana colored, but instead of white, she has used a bright color combination. Since we are used to banana\u2019s white and yellow colors, seeing the colors replaced with magenta and turquoise makes the visual pop.\n\nAnother example of adding unexpected bright color to your designs is this cover letter design by Anagrama Studio.\n\nThe hand-woven rug company Odabashian makes primarily neutral-colored rugs with their bright yellow tag stitched onto the bottom side of their rugs.\n\nTo visualize this Odabashian detail, Anagrama Studio has tried to use a similar concept by using neutral colors for the front page of the cover letter and a bright yellow for the back of the page, mimicking the bright yellow tag of the rugs.\n\nThis is a perfect example of how you can use bright colors in unexpected places and, at the same time, give meaning to them by being in line with the brand\u2019s core strategy.\n\nThe bright yellow on the back page is wildly unexpected, given most documents use black and white colors or just a pop of color here and there.\n\nSo if you want to make the viewer feel taken aback, try to think differently and replace the colors of real-life objects (and even people) with unusual colors that would only exist in a fantasy world.\n\n2. White Space and Bright Colors - a Match Made in Heaven\n\nNothing \u201cbegs\u201d more for the use of bright colors than a street art festival.\n\nAnd the creator of this bright-colored poster has not disappointed, using several bright colors to transmit feelings of excitement and happiness.\n\nSometimes, a colored background also works well with bright colors, but nothing makes bright colors pop more than a simple, white background. It is a match made in heaven, especially if you use various bright colors mixed together.\n\nIn this example, the white background color is necessary to give the eyes room to \u201cbreathe\u201d and take in the colorful characters.\n\nUnless you want to make your design intentionally complicated, such as designing a \u201cWhere's Wally\u201d poster or interactive Google game, you need to leave space between the characters you design. Picking a neutral background to guide the viewers\u2019 attention to your colorful designs is always a smart move.\n\nAlternatively, you can reverse-engineer this concept and use a bright colored background and white figures in the foreground. It all depends on your idea and which part of the design you want to make it pop.\n\n3. A Touch of Bright Color is All You Need\n\nLess is more sometimes. And this cannot be more true than in this case.\n\nThe designer has only added a touch of bright color to this label design, which is more than enough to make the design pop.\n\nThe yellow half-circle mixed with neutral colors works very well for this Vincit beer label design. If you want to keep using neutral colors but think that the overall design is craving a touch of bright color, feel free to experiment with it.\n\nTry out different bright colors and use them sparingly. We recommend not using too many bright colors to your design if you aim to add just a touch of bright color. One or two bright colors may be more than enough to make your design sparkle.\n\n4. Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Go Monotone\n\nGoing monotone is not only a great fashion tip but also a great way to make your graphic design stand out and look professional.\n\nUsing monochromatic colors can work perfectly with your design concept.\n\nYou just need to pay extra attention to details so that you use the right shade in the right places. For instance, you can use lighter shades of the same color to indicate where the source of light is coming from and use darker shades for the design parts that are not \u201chit\u201d by the light source.\n\nIn the above example, the designer has used a blue color palette. We can see that the source of light is coming from behind. We can tell this by looking at the contrast between the darker and lighter shades of blue color used in this design.\n\nThe white color also plays a significant role in this design as it is used to create a more defined silhouette and break the monotony of blue combinations, giving the eyes a place to rest. The blue background is also in the same shade as the main part of the body so that the viewers\u2019 attention gets directed to the white elements of the design.\n\nUsing a monochromatic color scheme with just one color is also an option. However, if you need to add typography, try to use only one color for the letters. White letters with an elegant color scheme such as monochromatic usually work great together.\n\nTo make the design more visually appealing and at the same time to add more depth to it, playing with different shades of the same color, such as variations of darker shades with lighter shades, will do wonders.\n\nDark colors combined with light colors are primarily used to create color harmony and make powerful design combinations.\n\nMonochrome and duo-chrome design is also part of our 2021 graphic design trends list, so you can be sure that this is an effective color combination this year.\n\nWhich Bright Color Palette Should You Use?\n\nKnowing you will use a bright color palette is one thing.\n\nChoosing which bright color palette you will use is entirely another thing.\n\nTo make your choice easier, start doing some research before picking random colors that might not work well with the overall brand. If you are a freelancer and need to design a logo for one of your clients or create a promotional poster, ask as many questions as possible in advance.\n\nThe people you will work with will be happy to help if you ask for a few directions before working on your design. Sometimes, a mood board will do wonders, helping you understand what your clients want and expect from you.\n\nYou can create a page in Jira or a Miro board to collect all the inspirations and design examples that the company and the team envision. All these bits and pieces will act as your mood board, helping you immensely when you pick the colors from the color wheel.\n\nFrom primary colors to complementary colors and complementary color combinations, the options are endless. Therefore any direction that will help you decide. For instance, will sequential color schemes or a completely fresh color combination be the best way to go?\n\nIf you need to create designs for female makeup or facial care products, a feminine color combination is probably your best bet.\n\nYour color choices can be a combination of royal purple, cobalt blue, dark green, royal blue, delicate pinks, bold orange, dark gray, light blues, charcoal gray, lime green, and blazing yellow.\n\nYou can combine approachable colors such as cream gold colors with metallic gold or cool gray and add a touch of bright color to make the design pop.\n\nAnother combination of colors can be combining one or two bright colors with a neutral shade or even deep shades and crisp shades. Using a bright shade such as bright green shades combined with other gorgeous shades will also help you create a vibrant scheme.\n\nAdding a gradient, such as a purple gradient or a green gradient, is also trendy nowadays. There are so many types of color combinations, so play around with hex codes and decide on the colors you want to use. You can play and learn more about the gradient tool on Vectornator.\n\nImage Source: Rodolfo Clix\n\nReady to explore any color family of your choice and start your cool color combination journey?

And if you prefer videos, then you can't miss this new video by Daisy Ein from the Envato Tuts+ YouTube channel:\n\nWhat Is the Psychology of Fonts?\n\nImages are not simply colours and shapes on a page, or at least not for humans.\n\nHuman beings have an innate instinct to anthropomorphise non-human entities, applying human characteristics and emotions to things that are distinctly non-human\u2014such as logos, for example.\n\nBecause human beings respond to visual culture in an emotional way, designers can manipulate the psychological responses of their viewers by making informed choices about the features of a design, such as colours and fonts. Applying the psychology of fonts in marketing is starting to become an important field of research and practice in branding and advertising.\n\nAlthough this was once the preserve of large corporations, now smaller businesses are also recognising the value of applying the psychology of fonts in marketing and brand design. Different fonts have been proven to have astonishing effects on human psychology, with some powerful fonts even able to alter the taste of food or make people angry to the point of social revolution. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that brands are starting to hire designers with a savvy knack for understanding the psychology of fonts and finding a use for emotional fonts.\n\nFor designers and businesses, an understanding of typography psychology is key to shaping both how memorable a brand is and how customers perceive it.\n\nBecause human beings are more engaged with visual content than written content (a phenomenon termed the Picture Superiority Effect by psychologists), the appearance of the text (i.e. the font) on a brand\u2019s logo, advertising and other output is more important in determining brand perception and brand memorability than the written content.\n\nNot only is the appearance of text an important consideration for brands, but the appearance of different fonts can also have psychological effects on the viewer. By changing the style of font, choosing a more emotional font or a powerful font, a designer can make the viewer feel and respond differently towards a brand.\n\nFor example, a bank that wants to communicate a sense of stability and heritage to its customers might opt for a traditional serif font, while a tech start-up might choose a futuristic sans serif font, to encourage customers to perceive them as innovative and forward-thinking.\n\nA psychological approach can also be taken towards other design elements, such as colour. Savvy designers can combine multiple psychological effects by choosing particular fonts and colours, resulting in a psychologically engineered combination of design elements that communicates one or multiple emotional moods.\n\nAlthough the psychology of fonts is most keenly applied in the world of branding, designers working with any form of text should know a little about how font choice affects the mood and perception of viewers.\n\nTypesetting a book? A transitional serif font like Baskerville will help readers to feel that the text has more authority and intellect.\n\nDesigning a wedding invitation? The right script font can simultaneously communicate romance, fun, and tradition.\n\nBelow, discover the six major different font groups, their psychological associations, and examples of how the psychology of fonts is used in brand design.\n\n1. Serifs: Trustworthy Fonts\n\nPsychological Associations of Serif Fonts: Stability, Tradition, Intellect, and Formality\n\nLet's talk about the formal fonts: the serif typefaces. Until the 19th century, books and pamphlets were set in serif type\u2014a style inherited from early Roman and, later, Blackletter typefaces. The first sans serif typeface appeared in print in 1816, but serifs still remained widely popular throughout the late 19th century and into the early 20th century.\n\nBecause of this heritage, these formal fonts instantly evoke a sense of establishment and tradition, an association that is carried through into the branding of many banks, law firms, and newspapers. It's a favourite font style in publishing, with most books still set in serif type, helping to communicate a mood of intellect and authority to readers.\n\nThe psychology of fonts in a serif style stems from their history. Because we are used to seeing serif fonts as symbols of heritage (on historical artefacts and prints), intellect (in books and academic papers), and formality (on fancy invitations and high-end restaurant menus), we perceive serif fonts as trustworthy and dependable. In other words, we know where they\u2019ve been and that they are often the defining, powerful font style of long-established and respected institutions, such as universities and banks.\n\nAside from colleges and financial institutions, many of which have been using serif typefaces for decades or centuries, other businesses looking to appear equally trustworthy and established can use a serif font to assert this in their branding. Law firms, news channels, and luxury fashion brands often use serif fonts in their branding and communications to capitalise on the dependability association. Serifs are trustworthy fonts without a doubt.\n\nExamples in Logo Design: HSBC, Wikipedia, TIME, CBS News, Gap, Dior, Rolex, Vogue, Tiffany & Co\n\nFonts to Try: Baskerville, Addington, Garamond, Caslon\n\n2. Slab Serifs: Powerful Fonts\n\nPsychological Associations of Slab Serif Fonts: Enduring, Strong, Powerful, and Masculine\n\nSlab serif fonts are chunkier, bolder interpretations of the serif type style. Usually thicker along both the stem and serifs of letterforms, they inherit some of the traits of serif fonts, such as stability and tradition, but are also bolder and more distinctive.\n\nSlab serif fonts lack the delicacy of serif fonts, making them feel a little brash and macho. Electronics companies and car manufacturers often use slab serifs to communicate a sense of power and masculinity in their branding.\n\nIn the wrong context, a slab serif could feel confrontational, but when used in the branding of companies that have a manufacturing focus, they feel strong, capable, and enduring. A slab serif is an assertive and powerful font, telling viewers that this is a practical, hands-on business that also has historical, dependable roots.\n\nExamples in Logo Design: Sony, Honda, Volvo, IBM, Coach\n\nFonts to Try: Rockwell, Detroit, Darius, BW Glenn Slab\n\n3. Sans Serifs: Friendly Fonts\n\nPsychological Associations of Sans Serif Fonts: Progressive, Informal, Open, and Friendly\n\nReferring to a wide group of fonts which lack serifs (the small strokes attached to the ends of letterforms on serif fonts), sans serif typefaces were formally invented in the early 19th century but only became popular much later, during the 20th century, when the modernist movement championed a break away from traditional design forms, including serif type styles.\n\nSans serif fonts are progressive and emotional fonts, historically popular as advertising fonts and cool fonts for posters. These friendly fonts culturally represent a break with tradition, giving these emotional fonts a progressive personality.\n\nIn recent decades, these simple and different fonts have defined the branding of a wide number of tech companies and social media sites, helping users to feel that these products are forward-thinking\u2014the opposite of the sometimes stuffy, change-resistant reputation of serif styles.\n\nThe psychological association with progression and modernity also extends to brands that want to appear innovative and adventurous, such as Jeep, Land Rover, and National Geographic.\n\nUnencumbered with the fuss of decorative serifs, sans serifs appear as open and friendly fonts, making them a favourite with businesses that want to appear approachable and good value. Budget airlines, logistics companies, and high-street retailers often opt for sans serif fonts to make their customers feel welcome and comfortable.\n\nExamples in Logo Design: Nike, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Dropbox, Spotify, FedEx, National Geographic\n\nFonts to Try: Arial, Modelica, Open Sans\n\nIn this article, we'll take a look at the history of sans serif typefaces. You'll learn what makes them great and discover some options for your next project. Fonts\n\nSans serif fonts are becoming more popular, with many high-profile companies using them in their logos and branding. So check out this guide to learn what... Fonts\n\n4. Modern Sans Serifs: Chic Fonts\n\nPsychological Associations of Modern Sans Serif Fonts: Chic, Futuristic, and Elegant\n\nA sub-family of sans serif fonts, modern sans serifs are sans serif fonts in the tradition of early- to mid-20th-century modernist type styles. Helvetica, Futura, and Avenir are some of the oldest and best-known modern fonts, but the popularity of the style has endured, with a huge range of contemporary geometric sans serifs to choose from.\n\nThese chic fonts were often used as advertising fonts and associated with the boom in modernist design during the 1950s. They're a popular choice amongst design-focused businesses and brands, such as architecture practices, furniture retailers, and fashion brands. In fashion in particular, a clear split down the line emerges between brands who opt for the lofty, luxurious elegance of serif fonts, such as Dior and Valentino, and those who prefer the chic functionality of sans serifs, including Chanel and Calvin Klein. The latter group, it seems, would rather appear more futuristic and minimalist in both brand and business.\n\nGeometric, elegant fonts often also feature rounded letterforms, giving them an open, functional appearance. These chic fonts can be exceptionally rounded, such as George Round, giving the viewer a sense of playfulness and naivety and making them a popular choice for children\u2019s brands, as well as travel and entertainment brands targeting the older millennial market.\n\nExamples in Logo Design: Chanel, Celine, Calvin Klein, Burberry, Netflix, Google, Airbnb\n\nFonts to try: Futura, George Round, Okana\n\n5. Scripts: Fun Fonts\n\nPsychological Associations of Script Fonts: Creative, Amusing, Fun, Childlike, and Romantic\n\nScript and fun handwriting fonts can lean towards formality or naivety, depending on the style and context. That's the beauty of typography psychology. Calligraphy fonts, inspired by the traditional method of handwriting using ink pens, feel more formal and sophisticated, and are often adopted by luxury brands or high-end restaurants in their branding and menus. Many contemporary script fonts are more informal and eclectic, mimicking the diversity of modern handwriting styles and making them fun fonts.\n\nThese eclectic and different fun fonts are evocative of handwriting and doodling, connecting them with creativity and eccentricity. Given their unique and quirky form, these emotional fonts are rarely sombre. Script fonts also remind the viewer of youth and first romances, making them a popular choice for Valentine\u2019s cards and wedding invitations.\n\nThe association with youth and amusement also makes fun handwriting fonts popular for candy packaging and food products aimed at children, such as cereal and soft drinks, as well as cool fonts for posters and advertising fonts.\n\nLove handwritten fonts?

Fonts\n\nIn terms of the psychology of fonts in marketing, script fonts have a particular history. In some cases, these emotional fonts have a retro personality, as these type styles (sometimes referred to as \u2018diner\u2019 fonts) enjoyed spells of popularity in advertising and branding during the 1950s. Brands like Ray-Ban and Coca-Cola have chosen to retain the original script form of their logos\u00ad\u2014reinforcing a connection between the past and present and tapping into a nostalgic marketing mood.\n\nExamples in Logo Design: Disney, Mailchimp, Ray-Ban, Coca-Cola, Reese\u2019s, Pinterest, Virgin, Kellogg\u2019s, Budweiser, Cartier\n\nFonts to Try: Seldoms, Sinisuka\n\n6. Display: Independent Fonts\n\nPsychological Associations of Display Fonts: Novel, Trail-Blazing, Unique, and Adaptable\n\nIf you encounter a different font you can\u2019t quite place in a neat category, it\u2019s likely it would be classified as a display or novelty font. Some of these types of powerful fonts create a sort of pictographic representation, blending a graphic image with text (see the Tour de France and NASA logo designs), while others are simply heavily stylised. Display fonts are largely meant for that purpose alone, meaning they can work wonderfully as part of headlines or logo designs but rarely as standard text intended for longer reading.\n\nDesigners and brands usually opt for display fonts to give an impression of individuality and difference, with the practice of the psychology of fonts for logos often featuring display styles. Many of the logo examples below use completely customised fonts or illustrative type, using the psychology of fonts in logos to create a unique effect that is unlikely to be seen anywhere else. For playful brands like Lego and Oreo, logos set in display fonts heighten the novelty of the product, making it feel more exciting and interesting.\n\nDisplay fonts are not for the shy and retiring\u2014by using one in your design, you are imploring viewers to \u2018look at me!\u2019 However, these unique fonts are definitely fonts that evoke emotion and can't be ignored. So for brands looking to appear distinct from similar businesses, they can help to foster a sense of uniqueness and inspire fierce loyalty amongst their employees and customers, who feel they are buying from or working for somebody who does things a little differently to the mainstream.\n\nGrassroots and independent organisations also often opt for display fonts in their communications, serving to mark them out as anti-conformist and trail-blazing.\n\nExamples in Logo Design: Tour de France, Yahoo!, NASA, Lego, Subway, Oreo, Greenpeace, MTV, Warner Bros\n\nIn this article, we touch on the history of display fonts, outlining some essential tips and great examples from our Envato Elements library.

Fonts\n\nConclusion: The Power of Font Psychology\n\nKnowing a little about the psychological effects that different font styles can have on the viewer can help you to make more informed design decisions, especially when it comes to creating brand identities and logo designs. An understanding of these effects will allow you to apply the principles of the psychology of fonts to marketing and the psychology of fonts in logos.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ve looked at how six type macro-families are able to shape the reaction of the viewer, and how using different fonts and powerful fonts can instantly shift the personality and psychological impact of your designs, leading to more effective branding decisions.\n\nDiscover a range of cool fonts for posters, psychologically powerful fonts, and fonts that evoke emotion on Envato Elements.\n\nWant to learn more about the psychology of typography?

Many art mediums are available, allowing artists and creators to express themselves in hundreds of different ways.\n\nYou can also combine many art mediums to create mixed media pieces, such as markers under paint or sculptures containing glass and wood. The medium an artist chooses can be as impactful as the final piece.\n\nFor example, take Yoko Ono\u2019s \u201cApple\u201d. Apple demonstrates a time when the medium was the most critical part of the artwork. Ono could have chosen an art medium that would last, such as oil paint or sculpture, but she decided to use an apple. This choice of medium transformed the work into ephemeral art, which could not survive.\n\nWhether you\u2019re learning to make art or just curious about different ways artists choose to work, here are 33 different types of art mediums you can explore.\n\n1- Drawing\n\nPictures, diagrams, and sketches made with anything other than paint are drawings. Drawing includes charcoal, pencils, pens, ink, pastels, crayons, and many others, which makes it one of the most versatile art mediums.\n\nDrawing is one of the oldest art mediums and has likely been around since the dawn of humankind. The oldest known drawn picture is a crayon doodle estimated to be about 73,000 years old.\n\nSince then, techniques have evolved. Artists use hatching, stippling, shading, blending, and many other methods to create art ranging from surreal to hyperrealistic.\n\n2- Pastel\n\nPastels are a part of the drawing medium. They are made by combining intense pigments with a binder of some kind. This method creates a less-waxy crayon that artists can easily blend to create soft, glowy art with bright colors.\n\nPastels have been around since about the 16th century. One of the most iconic pastel pieces is Hassam\u2019s \u201cPoppies, Isles of Shoals\u201d, completed in 1891. With its soft lines and vibrant colors, Poppies exemplifies the best of the medium.\n\nThere are many sub-categories of pastels, including soft, hard, chalk, and pan-pastels.\n\nSoft Pastels\n\nSoft pastels are the most traditional form of pastel. They are made from highly concentrated pigment and a small amount of gum binder. They are incredibly vibrant and blend easily but are difficult to use for detail work.\n\nHard Pastels\n\nHard pastels use the same highly concentrated pigment as soft pastels but with far more gum binder. The extra binder allows you to sharpen them so you can use them for detailed work and outlines. While you can use the points to create fine lines, they are still excellent tools for broad coloring if you use the stick\u2019s side and blend the colors.\n\nChalk Pastels\n\nChalk pastels use more binder than any other kind of pastel. This extra binder makes them very easy to use and more difficult to break, but much less blendable. Chalk pastels are often used with students and children to teach pastel art techniques.\n\nPan Pastels\n\nThese pastels are similar to soft pastels, but instead of being crayon shaped, they are placed into small jars. Because they don\u2019t have to be in a stick, they use even less gum binder, which allows for even more vibrant colors and blendability.\n\nOil Pastels\n\nOil pastels have slightly more binder than soft pastels, which makes them less crumbly and easier to use. Artists often use oil pastels for quick sketches and impressionist drawings.\n\n3. Graphite Pencil\n\nOut of all the different art mediums, graphite has a remarkable ability to create hyperrealistic art. Graphite is a highly accessible art form for students and beginners because it is an inexpensive drawing medium. All graphite produces shades of gray.\n\nGraphite pencils come in a variety of \u2018hardnesses,\u2019 in categories soft black (B), hard black (HB), and hard (H). Within the B category, pencils can range in hardness from 8B to 2B, with 8B being the softest, darkest pencil. Within the H category, pencils range from 2H to 6H, with 6H being the hardest.\n\nHarder graphite pencils deposit less graphite per stroke, leaving a lighter color behind. Conversely, soft pencils leave more graphite with each stroke, leaving near-black dark lines behind.\n\n4. Colored Pencil\n\nColored pencils are a recent addition to the drawing art medium. The first colored pencil was an oil pastel pencil invented in 1834. Because of their versatility, cleanliness, and price, colored pencils are popular among children worldwide.\n\nWhile you can find colored pencils in schools everywhere, professional artists also use them. Nicer colored pencils that contain more and better pigment are a popular medium for many artists that want to draw in color.\n\nThe fine tip of the pencil allows artists to create incredibly detailed works in soft, smooth colors. One of the most famous colored pencil artists today is Marco Mazzoni, an Italian artist who draws intense, surreal art featuring faces and hands.\n\n5. Charcoal\n\nCharcoal is one of the more traditional art mediums available. As a simple drawing tool, it has been found in cave paintings over 25 thousand years old. Charcoal is a quick-to-use art medium, as it leaves strong black lines behind with a gentle touch.\n\nBecause of its bendability and depth, artists often use charcoal to create contrasts of light and dark in pieces. For example, da Vinci\u2019s \u201cThe Head of The Virgin in Three-Quarter View Facing Right\u201d displays Mary in an almost aetherial warm glow despite being rendered in grayscale.\n\n6. Ink Pen\n\nInk pen is another iconic drawing medium first used in early history. The first recorded use of ink on paper was around 300 BC. While you often used it for writing and recording, da Vinci popularized it as an art medium when he used it to create his iconic pieces, Five Grotesque Heads and Vitruvian Man.\n\nInk pens can draw thin, precise lines, though they shade poorly. Ballpoint pens have become more popular with modern artists for their accessibility and ability to shade. Hyper Realistic ballpoint pen art has risen in popularity across social media in recent years.\n\n7. Chalk\n\nOf all the drawing art mediums, chalk might be the oldest. It has been found in cave paintings around the world. Originally, the only chalk humans had available was limestone broken into chunks and scraped against rocks. Today, many colors and pigments of chalk are available.\n\nChalk is incredibly versatile, as you can use it to fill space and sharpen to draw lines. For example, Michelangelo wetted red chalk and used varying pressures to create depth. He represented this technique well in his piece \u201cSeated Male Nude; Separate Study Of His Right Arm\u201d, which shows blending, highlights and depths, and flat lines, all created with red chalk.\n\n8. Painting\n\nMany types of art mediums fall under the label of paint. The primary difference between drawing and painting is that paint has to dry. The art medium is considered a kind of paint if it needs to dry after being placed on a page. Although, mediums like ink blur this line.\n\nPainting is an ancient art medium. The estimated earliest use of paint was about 100,000 years ago. Early humans used many materials to make paint, including plants, bones, and rocks. Today, paints have evolved to include acrylic paints, oil paints, watercolors, and many others.\n\n9. Watercolor Painting\n\nWatercolor paint is made when a pigment is ground up and mixed with a gum binding. The artist will combine this with varying amounts of water to create different effects. Works done in this art medium can be soft and muted when mixed with lots of water or bright and vibrant if mixed with less water.\n\nWatercolor is one of the oldest painting mediums. Historians estimate that watercolors have been used since at least 4,000 BC. While many think of watercolor as consisting of broad, undetailed swaths of color, it is a fine art medium that you can use to do intricate work.\n\nOne of the most famous watercolor paintings is Young Hare by D\u00fcrer (1502). In this piece, D\u00fcrer painstakingly painted individual hairs in a young hare\u2019s coat, capturing the texture of the soft fur in a challenging medium.\n\n10. Acrylic Paint\n\nAcrylic paint is a newer addition to the list of painting mediums. The first acrylic painting was completed in the 1950s. Unlike older art mediums, acrylic paint relies on synthetic resin to bind. Acrylic paint can produce incredibly vibrant and colorful pieces because it doesn\u2019t need to be diluted in water to be used.\n\nBecause of its unique properties, some modern artists have developed all-new painting techniques with acrylic. For example, Adrienne Judge has gained recent fame for her \u2018paint sculptures,\u2019 where she pipes acrylic paints into beautiful 3D flower displays. Other artists intentionally lifted paint off finished pieces to create white space.\n\n11. Oil Painting\n\nOil painting is a traditional artistic medium that artists first used as early as the 7th century. It is made by mixing ground pigments with linseed oil and varnish to create a smooth, stiff paste. The linseed oil slows the drying of the paint, giving the artist time to work.\n\nOil paint may have the most famous works of all the art mediums artists have ever used. American Gothic by Grant Wood, The Starry Night by Van Gough, Mona Lisa by da Vinci, and most of Monet\u2019s pieces are all oil paintings.\n\nThere is no art medium more versatile or iconic than oil paint. Depending on the artist, oil paints can make soft and muted colors, bright and vibrant scenes, broad impressionist interpretations, and finely detailed recreations.\n\n12. Egg Tempera Paint\n\nEgg Tempera Paint is an old art medium with uses dating back to ancient Egypt. This painting medium uses eggs as a binder. Egg yolk is typically mixed with pigments and linseed oil to make a paint that dries quickly.\n\nBefore the widespread use of oil paints, egg tempera paint was one of the most widely used art mediums. For example, Botticelli\u2019s The Birth of Venus and da Vinci\u2019s The Last Supper are tempera paintings.\n\n13. Gouache\n\nGouache paint is used similarly to watercolor paint. It is contained in small, highly pigmented containers that the artist dilutes for different purposes. However, while watercolor often loses much of its vibrancy when the artist adds water, Gouache remains bright and colorful despite dilution.\n\nOne of the most famous people in the art world to use Gouache is Pablo Picasso; several of his renowned portrait paintings used Gouache as their medium.\n\n14. Hot Wax Painting (Encaustic Painting)\n\nHot wax paintings are known in the art world as encaustic paintings. Encaustic painting is a unique art medium that uses layers of hot, pigmented wax on wood panels. Many artists that use this medium also carve into their pieces to create depth and sharper lines. Due to the nature of wax, most encaustic paintings have a soft glow.\n\nThe first hot wax paintings were likely made in the 5th century, making encaustic paint one of the oldest art mediums on this list.\n\nSee full guide on Encaustic Painting.\n\n15. Fresco Painting\n\nFresco painting is an artistic medium that uses water-based paints on fresh plaster. This kind of painting is usually done on walls and, on some occasions, ceilings. Fresco painting is among the older art mediums, as it was invented around 2000 BC.\n\nThe Sistine Chapel ceiling is likely the world\u2019s most famous fresco painting. It took Michelangelo four years to paint, standing on a handmade scaffold and craning his neck to work.\n\n16. Mixed Media\n\nMixed media art encompasses a wide array of art mediums. Whenever an artist uses two or more mediums in art, the piece is considered mixed media art.\n\nThe most common mixed media art forms are collage, assemblage, sculpture, installation, wet-and-dry media, and altered book art.\n\n17. Collage\n\nCollaging is a unique art medium consisting of scraps of paper from other artworks, magazines, books, and newspapers to overlay them and create something new.\n\nMany artists that use collage have steered clear of using words, such as Man Ray\u2019s A Paradigm for Performance. Hannah Hoch is credited as the creator of photomontages, a category of collage that focuses on photos.\n\nSee our full guide on Collage.\n\n18. Installation Art\n\nInstallation art is a newer artistic medium that started in the 1900s, though it did not gain popularity until the 60s. Installation artworks seek to create an experience for the viewer and can take up whole rooms or sections of museums.\n\nOne of the most iconic installation artists in recent times is Yayoi Kusama, in her series \u201cInfinity Rooms\u201d. Kusama creates the illusion of infinite space filled with lights, colors, and shapes in these pieces. The mirror rooms immerse the viewer in Kusama\u2019s art and the worlds she creates.\n\nInstallation arts can also often have a performative aspect to them. Sun Yuan and Peng Yu\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Help Myself\u201d was an installation piece in the Guggenheim. In the piece, a robot with an arm and squeegee attempted to clean up the mess of ink around it. In the process, it would fling ink and debris around the room, destroying its progress.\n\nCan\u2019t Help Myself is an installation piece that incorporates movement and performance and is better off for it. Instead of a still of a person or robot inadvertently ruining their work, viewers can see the devastation happen in person, in real-time.\n\n19. Assemblage\n\nAssemblage is a unique mixed-media art form that is difficult to define. Assemblage art is mixed media components used to create sculptures, three-dimensional art, or installations. It may best be described as a three-dimensional collage.\n\nAssemblage is a modern art form that gained popularity in the 50s and 60s. Among the most notable assemblage artists is Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg used collections of scrap objects to create three-dimensional artworks. At the time, Rauschenberg called this artmaking \u201cCombine,\u201d but today, we know it as an assemblage.\n\nSee full guide on Assemblage.\n\n20. Printmaking\n\nOf all the different art mediums, nothing lends itself to repetition as printmaking does. Printmaking involves making a template, usually a stamp, that printmakers can transfer onto another page. Because an artist can use a stamp repeatedly to create the same piece, printmaking was a vital art form before scanners, and high-quality printers were common.\n\n\u201cUnder the Wave off Kanagawa\u201d by Katsushika Hokusai might be the most famous printmaking artwork in the world. It\u2019s estimated that the original carving made about 1,000 copies of The Wave.\n\nMany different art mediums fit under the printmaking category, including screen printing and intaglio.\n\n21. Screen Printing\n\nScreen printing is a type of printmaking, though the process is more complex. In screen printing, the artist creates a pattern on a screen. They then place the screen over another medium, usually a canvas or piece of fabric.\n\nThe artist will then take ink and press it through the screen, leaving the pattern behind on the medium under the screen. Most screen printing artists use a few screens with slight design variations to create a multi-colored piece of art.\n\nAndy Warhol\u2018s Marilyn Monroe exemplifies the unique parts of screen printing. He created many different final pieces of Marilyn Monroe from the same screens, all with different colors, creating a vibrant series of pop art pieces that remain famous today.\n\nSee full guide on Screen Printing.\n\n22. Intaglio\n\nIntaglio is another artistic medium that falls under the category of printmaking. Intaglio describes an artistic process where the artist carves into a medium such as wood. They will then fill the etching with ink and let it dry, creating a single artwork.\n\nMany artists have experimented with intaglio, including Pablo Picasso. Unlike other printmaking mediums, intaglio is not repeatedly printable, which makes it more similar to other single-make art mediums.\n\n23. Sculpture\n\nSculpture is an art form in which the artist creates a three-dimensional piece by carving or casting materials. Sculptors typically use materials like stone, wood, metal, or plaster. Sculptures come in three main categories: high relief, bah relief (also known as low relief), and freestanding.\n\nHigh-relief sculptures are carved into flat plants, such as walls, foundations, or doors, but are intricately detailed and appear three-dimensional.\n\nBah relief sculptures are flatter than high-relief sculptures and appear less three-dimensional. A common example of bas-relief sculpture is hieroglyphics and art carved into cave walls.\n\nFreestanding sculptures are what people most commonly think of when they think of sculptures. Freestanding pieces are fully three-dimensional works that viewers can observe from any angle.\n\n24. Clay\n\nClay is one of the oldest art mediums, with the oldest known sculpture dating back to 26,000 BC. Clay is a diverse art medium that includes many kinds of clay, such as earthenware, stoneware, ball, fire, and porcelain.\n\nOf the different clay art mediums, ball clays and porcelain clays are most often used for sculpture, while other clays are more often used for functional purposes, such as bricks, cups, bowls, or plates.\n\nClay sculptures can range from brightly colored, fun, and whimsical, such as those made by Lorien Stern, to surrealist humor, such as those made by Robert Arneson.\n\n25. Acrylic Resin\n\nAcrylic resin is among the newest art mediums, especially for sculpture. It was invented in 1915 by Otto R\u00f6hm of Germany. Artists typically make acrylic resin sculptures by pouring a resin mixture into a mold.\n\nIf done well, acrylic resins can be made completely clear. Embedding flowers, gold, and other colors of acrylic into a clear resin has become a popular trend in modern art. Acrylic resin has been combined with wood, other plastics, paint, and many other materials to make unique mixed media pieces.\n\nOne notable artist who uses acrylic resins in sculpture is Dan Lam. She uses bright, vibrant acrylic to create unique sculptures that appear fluid with movement.\n\n26. Metal Art\n\nArtists can make metal sculptures in many ways, including molds or welding. While metal sculpting is often considered a modern art form, casting metals for artistic purposes dates back as far as 6,000 years.\n\nToday, artists often use metal sculptures to create sturdy public art installations. \u201cCloud Gate\u201d by Anish Kapoor (commonly known as \u201cThe Bean\u201d) is a famous example of metal sculpture used to bring art into a public space.\n\nMetal sculpture is closely related to architecture, though they are different. Usually, if a piece can be entered and used as a functional building, it is considered architecture, not sculpture. Nonetheless, some architects have begun to push these boundaries.\n\nFor example, the Tower of the Sun in Kazakhstan sacrifices some functionality for beauty and aesthetics, bringing it farther from architecture and closer to sculpture.\n\n27. Glass\n\nGlass is amongst the oldest art mediums. It was invented around 5000 BC in Syria, and makers used it almost immediately to make arrowheads, blades, and jewelry. However, glass blowing (and therefore sculpting) would not be invented for another 4,000 years.\n\nGlass blowing is a technique that involves creating molten glass from sand and attaching it to a long blow tube. Next, the artist will blow into the tube, creating a hollow center around a glass balloon. This glass can be pulled with shears, cut, spun, cooled at different temperatures, or put through various techniques to create various appearances.\n\nGlass blowing and sculpting have become incredibly popular in modern art. Dave Chihuly is one of the most prolific contemporary glass sculptors. Chihuly uses bright colors and abstract, organic shapes to create eye-catching displays currently exhibited across the United States.\n\n28. Stone\n\nThe oldest known statues in the world are made of stone. Stone was an easy tool for early humans due to its durability and accessibility. As a result, most early stone statues are carefully carved depictions of humans and animals.\n\nThe techniques and methods used in stone sculpting vary greatly depending on the material and artistic medium that the sculptor chooses. Many stone sculptors choose limestone or soapstone as its softness makes it easy to carve. Marble, as used in Michelango\u2019s David, is much harder to carve, but the results are much more durable.\n\nIn modern times, stone sculpting is less standard than it was, but it is still present. Many contemporary stone sculptors have begun to use concrete in addition to stone to make the process easier and to make statues last longer. You can see this method in Cristo Redentor\u2019s Christ the Redeemer, located in Rio.\n\n29. Wood\n\nThe creation of wood sculptures is done through wood carving, which is a form of woodworking. Woodworkers usually use a chisel and a knife to create wood carvings. Wood sculptures can be bah relief, high-relief, or three-dimensional.\n\nAnother way of performing wood art is via Pyrography, where artists will burn patterns into pieces of wood.\n\nWoods from various trees have different properties that lend themselves to different wood carving projects. For example, most woodcarvers prefer pines for carving because of their softness, but they also use maple, oak, and walnut woods.\n\nWood carvings can look nothing like the trees they originally came from, as with Jean Arp\u2019s Head and Shell, or they can incorporate the natural grains of the wood, such as Aron Demetz does in his work.\n\n30. Photography\n\nPhotography as a medium is defined as the capture of light digitally or onto a medium. The first photograph was taken in 1826 by a French scientist named Joseph Nic\u00e9phore. He captured an image of the view out of the window in his home.\n\nSince then, photography has come a long way. It is used as a tool by the press to capture essential moments, by people to capture their families and lives, and by activists to capture their movements.\n\nPhotography as a medium is divided by what the photograph captures and the style of the photo. Photos can be in black and white or color and can capture landscapes, portraits, events, or candid moments.\n\n31. Black and White Photography\n\nOriginally, black-and-white photography was the only kind available. Today, more than one hundred years after the invention of color photography (in the 1890s), artists continue to use black-and-white photography as an intentional artistic choice.\n\nHenri Cartier-Bresson is famous for using only black and white photography. In his mind, color was an embellishment and often poorly represented the natural dullness that lived in the world. The color in photographs was overly exaggerated and not representative of the world as he saw it.\n\nSome artists prefer black and white for its ability to capture the depth of shadows and light. Others feel that it gives images a classic, vintage feeling. Whatever the reason, black-and-white photography will likely continue to stick around, despite color photography being more accessible than ever.\n\n32. Landscape Photography\n\nLandscape photography is exactly what it sounds like: the photography of nature and landscapes. Most landscape photography aims to bring the viewer into the photo and see the world the way the photographer sees it. In essence, most landscape photographers aim to share beauty.\n\nArtists can do landscape photography in brilliant color that replicates exactly what they saw. David Noton is a great example of this approach to photography. Many of his pictures contain bright, saturated colors that bring the viewer into his photos.\n\nOther landscape photographers, such as Ansel Adams, have captured the light and shadows of nature in black and white. Adams is famous for capturing the United State\u2019s national parks and most iconic scenes in the sharp relief of black and white photography.\n\n33. Portrait Photography\n\nPortrait photography is an art form that focuses on capturing a person\u2019s likeness in a photo. Only some portraits aim to be true to life, however. Some images aim to capture a feeling rather than create a replica of a person\u2019s face.\n\nSteve McCurry has aimed to do both of these things, depending on the portrait he is taking. Sometimes, he adds costumes and makeup and poses people in photographs. Other pictures feature intense eye contact in candid locations.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThere are many different art mediums, all of which lend themselves to different forms of artistic expression. The medium an artist chooses to use has a massive impact on the message of the final piece. While there are many art mediums described here, this list is by no means exhaustive.\n\nIf you\u2019re new to art, experiment with different art mediums and materials- you never know what you might find a passion for. Whether you find your style in paint mediums or digital art, learning to express yourself through art is the most powerful tool you\u2019ll ever use."}, {"url": "https://uxplanet.org/the-4-master-artists-who-used-nature-inspired-color-palettes-c10441c1c7d2", "page_content": "The 4 master artists who used nature-inspired color palettes\n\nAs designers, we can always get inspired by the master artists and their relationship with colors. Mandy Ding \u00b7 Follow Published in UX Planet \u00b7 \u00b7 Jan 5, 2021 8 min read -- 1 Listen Share\n\nMany artists in history were obsessed with colors in nature. When viewing their masterpieces, we could discover their intense passions, unconcealable emotions, and their staunch belief in the power of colors.\n\nAs a product designer, I also constantly think about what natural color patterns can be used to better connect with users. To get inspired, I want to take a whirlwind journey through modern art history, drill insights into what colors meant to some of the most creative geniuses, and discuss what can be leveraged to our design practices. \ud83d\ude09\n\nClaude Monet: the harmonious, analogous colors\n\nClaude Monet is among one of the most well-known Impressionism artists. Around the 1860s, he and a group of young artists decided to paint what they saw, thought, and felt in a simple and intuitive way.\n\nA partial snapshot of Claude Monet\u2019s \u201cWater Lillies\u201d (1915). Color palette picked by using Coolers.\n\nIt was a huge break away from their Realist predecessors. Claude Monet and his peer artists were much more interested in painting landscape and contemporary life, rather than depicting historical and mythological scenes.\n\nIf we take a close look at Monet\u2019s paintings, we can observe his focus on picturing nature and capturing the fleeting effects of natural light. The color palettes on his works were often soft and glowing, which convey a more intimate feel to the viewers.\n\nA partial snapshot of Claude Monet\u2019s \u201cWater Lilies and Japanese Bridge\u201d (1897\u201399). Color palette picked by using Coolers.\n\nMeanwhile, he often used analogous colors to draw natural sceneries. The \u201cWater Lillies\u201d series is one of the stunning examples. In the following \u201cWater Lillies\u201d painting created in 1908, we can sense the beauty of nature through the softly fluid blues and greens, with cream and a bit of pink. The smooth transitions between analogous colors create a sense of gentleness and calm.\n\nA partial snapshot of Claude Monet\u2019s \u201cWater Lillies\u201d (1908). Color palette picked by using Coolers.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Designer takeaway\n\nAnalogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye. Claude Monet\u2019s works can be a great place to find inspiration from if we want to convey a calm, gentle feel in the interface we\u2019re designing."}]}
