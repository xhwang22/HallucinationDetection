But the Bears' scouting department, which consisted of pro scout Bill Tobin and college scout Jim Parmer, remained in the old Halas Hall war room monitoring the draft as one name on the board, or in this case wall, stared back at them.\n\nSuper Bowl XX MVP Richard Dent was a four-time All-Pro selection. Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images\n\nTobin placed a second-round grade on a scrawny defensive end from Tennessee State named Richard Dent, which didn't mean he thought Dent would or even should be drafted then. But it did mean that was what he thought of his ability.\n\n\"When they came back from lunch,\" Tobin recalled, \"Finks walks over to the wall and says, 'Hey Toby, your second-round grade is still here. Think we should take him now?'\n\n\"I said, 'Hell yes, we should.' I was shocked he was still there.\"\n\nThe Bears' eighth-round steal was elected this week to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, just one more notch on the belt for Tobin, who, in addition to drafting Walter Payton and scouting every member of the Bears' '85 Super Bowl champs, has the distinction of drafting two of the six players in the 2011 Hall of Fame class in Dent and Marshall Faulk, whom he chose as GM of the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nBut it was the underweight kid Tobin fell in love with in the fall of 1982 who made him feel like \"a proud papa\" this week.\n\nLugging his projector and a bottle of whiskey as a gift for Dent's coach, Tobin remembers it was cold and so muddy that October that they had scattered straw on the field at Tennessee State to improve the footing.\n\nIt didn't seem to affect Dent.\n\n\"The first sentence in my report,\" said Tobin, reading from the original, \"is 'This kid has to get a zero for quickness.' \"\n\nZero, it should be pointed out, is the best score a player can get.\n\n\"One is really special,\" Tobin said. \"I wrote, 'He is extremely quick off the ball, one of the fastest I have ever scouted.' \"\n\nWhen Tobin returned to Nashville to get more film that December -- \"Yeah, the technology wasn't quite what it is today,\" he said with a laugh -- Dent had a cast on his arm due to a complete dislocation of his wrist that required surgery. \"But they turned him loose against Chatanooga,\" said Tobin, who read some more from his report.\n\n\" 'He played one-armed, and he was still very effective,' \" he wrote. \" 'He is one of the quickest you will see upfield, and he has a mean streak in him. He will really wrap up the quarterback when he gets to him.' \"\n\nIf Tobin gets a kick out of looking back at his dead-on evaluation, it can't compare to the pride he had in seeing Dent grow.

'I plan to work very closely with Mike Ditka, Jerry Vainisi and Michael McCaskey.'\n\nTobin, who began his pro career with Houston in 1963 before going to the Canadian League, said he had turned down four offers from the USFL for 'jobs with more elaborate titles' than the one he has now with the Bears.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'But I wanted to be in the NFL with the Chicago Bears,' Tobin said.\n\nTobin added he anticipated the Bears would have to scout USFL games this spring for talent, adding he doesn't foresee a promising future for the rival league.\n\n'I think the NFL is doing a more aggressive selling job,' said Tobin, a native of Burlington Junction, Mo. 'I think there are some players who signed early that regret their decision ... I think we will look at the USFL games for the way they are going. They may not be around in a year or two.'\n\nMcCaskey said selecting a player personnel director was not modeled after any other team's organizational chart although he conceded it might be construed to be along the lines of the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n'I will make the final decision regarding draft choices and trades,' McCaskey added.\n\nDitka said his top priority for the upcoming draft would be defense, specifically defensive linemen.\n\n'We will want to get the best player available,' Ditka said. 'We didn't know this year that Dan (Hampton) would go down with injuries. I'd also like to see us look at a linebacker.'\n\nTobin said he didn't anticipate any disagreements with Ditka about whom to select in the draft, adding that McCaskey would have the ultimate say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTobin came to the Bears from the Green Bay Packers, where he was pro scouting director since 1972.\n\nIn a related matter, McCaskey said the club would evaluate moving to a new practice field away from Lake Forest, where the club experienced difficulty getting practice time because of inclement weather this past season.\n\nHe said he had visited facilities in Green Bay and Minnesota and estimated it would cost at least $500,000 to build an indoor facility to allow the team to practice during bad weather."}, {"url": "https://wikimili.com/en/Bill_Tobin_(American_football)", "page_content": "Nathan D.

Bill Tobin and longtime ESPN draft expert Mel Kiper. Roughly a week before that, the player Kiper believed the Colts should have taken shared with Ryen Russillo a story that, if true, makes the entire Tobin-Kiper kerfuffle moot.\n\nQuarterback Trent Dilfer told Russillo that the Colts didn\u2019t draft Dilfer because his agent, Mike Sullivan, had informed the Colts that Dilfer would not sign a contract with Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t go to the Colts because my agent told them I would sit out the year and I would then be the Panthers\u2019 first pick in their first year,\u201d Dilfer said. \u201cSo that was the whole Mel Kiper, General Manager argument on ESPN that gets shown every year. They couldn\u2019t pick me at five instead of Trev Alberts because we said I wouldn\u2019t play. So I always try to defend the Colts that way. And I regret it because I could have played with Marshall [Faulk] for a long time.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how long Dilfer would have played with Faulk. First, Faulk spent only five years with the Colts, before being traded to the Rams. Second, Dilfer may not have been the quarterback for very long in Indianapolis. In Tampa, he threw 17 touchdown passes against 43 interceptions during his first three seasons. This means that the Colts still may have been in position to take Peyton Manning four years after the Dilfer draft, even if the Colts had taken Dilfer.\n\nDilfer, who later threatened to sit out the 1994 season and re-enter the draft in a contract squabble with the Buccaneers, explained that his agent didn\u2019t believe the Colts were a viable destination for Dilfer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history between agents and GMs,\u201d Dilfer said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opinions on the direction franchises are gonna go, and you kind of have to trust them. . . . He was convinced that the Colts were going nowhere, that this was a bad situation to be in, even with Marshall Faulk gonna be there it wasn\u2019t enough. He was convinced that that was a bad spot, and convinced me and my family that that would not be the best spot for us and that Tampa would be better one pick later.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s no guarantee that Dilfer actually would have sat out a full season and re-entered the draft. It\u2019s rare that players make this threat before the draft, and it\u2019s even more rare that they act upon it. Also, maybe the Colts wouldn\u2019t have taken Dilfer regardless of his vow to boycott the team.\n\nThe Tobin-Kiper fight almost didn\u2019t happen for an entirely different reason. Dilfer told Russillo that, as of the night before the draft, Washington had decided to take Dilfer, not Heath Shuler, with the third overall selection.\n\nThe next morning, someone (it wasn\u2019t Dan Snyder; he hadn\u2019t bought the team yet) decided to take Shuler instead. Dilfer said that the surprise caused his wife, who was looking for houses in the Washington area, to start crying. Other family members scrambled to ensure that TV cameras wouldn\u2019t see her reaction to the announcement that Shuler was the pick at No. 3.\n\nBut for that unexpected, last-minute decision by Washington, TV cameras never would have captured Kiper\u2019s reaction to the Colts not taking Dilfer, and the even better reaction by Tobin to Kiper\u2019s comments. So, basically, we\u2019ve finally found a good reason for Washington\u2019s decision to draft Heath Shuler."}, {"url": "https://www.webot.org/info/en/?search=Bill_Tobin_(American_football)", "page_content": "American football player and executive (born 1941)\n\nAmerican football player\n\nBill Tobin (born February 16, 1941) is a former professional American football player who is currently a personnel executive for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL).

Their father Ed Tobin was a basketball captain at the Conception Junction, Missouri high school. The brothers both attended Maryville High School which is 16 miles from Burlington Junction but the family thought their sports prospects would be much better in the much bigger school (they commuted to the school).

It was Bears personnel boss Bill Tobin, asking Shiver if he were interested in a scouting job.\n\nShiver drove to Lake Forest, where Tobin made him an offer of $25,000 yearly \u2014 a raise of $7,000 from what he had been earning as a Blesto scout. Shiver accepted gladly, and he thought he hit the jackpot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter they shook hands, Tobin said, \u201cYou are going to be with the Bears a long time.\u201d\n\nThirty-two years later, Tobin looks prophetic.\n\nIf Shiver were a contestant on the show \u201cSurvivor,\u201d he\u2019d be a prohibitive favorite to win.\n\nShiver has been a full-time scout with the Bears longer than any personnel man in their 100-year history. It is believed Shiver has been with the Bears longer than any NFL scout has been continuously employed with one exception \u2014 Scott DiStefano has been with the Broncos five year longer.\n\nGeneral manager Ryan Pace is his sixth direct-report boss. He has worked with seven Bears head coaches.\n\nAn institution in the halls of Halas, Shiver has had a say in every Bears draft pick from Brad Muster to David Montgomery.\n\n\u201cJeff worked out even better than I thought,\u201d Tobin said. \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful person and damn good scout. He\u2019s been a giant in the scouting industry.\u201d\n\nSays former Bears general manager Jerry Angelo: \u201cI think the world of him. I don\u2019t know of anybody more respected and or revered in the scouting business than Jeff. I saw it from afar when I was with other teams and I saw it firsthand when I got to Chicago. Whatever he says, you can take it to the bank.\u201d\n\nShiver is a \u201cconsummate professional\u201d in the opinion of former Bears personnel director Rod Graves.\n\n\u201cI would always turn to Jeff when I needed what I call a core evaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if Ryan and the others after me didn\u2019t use Jeff the same way. He was totally reliable, a great evaluator and somebody I could trust.\u201d\n\nShiver, as is his way, credits his longevity to almost everyone in his contacts app. But he\u2019ll start with God, and Laura, the woman by his side for 34 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard job,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be able to do it begins with a great wife. Not once did I walk in the front door and hear her complain about me not being there.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe had a right to complain. Shiver, like many in his profession, typically spends 250 to 275 nights on the road every year. He has more than five million lifetime Marriott points.\n\nJeff Shiver was among the scouts watching Nebraska running back Lawrence Phillips during a workout at the Cornhuskers practice field in March 1996 in Lincoln. (AP Photo/Dave Weaver)\n\nHe usually gets where he\u2019s going in his Ford Edge. Past cornfields, clothes lines and white picket fences, he drives about 30,000 miles every year. Driving is better than flying because he can make stops at out-of-the-way schools like Western Illinois and Hillsdale College.\n\nOn the road, he has received wonderful news \u2014 \u201cHoney, I think I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d \u2014 and awful news \u2014 \u201cYour brother-in-law was in a car accident, and he didn\u2019t make it.\u201d\n\nAmong his best travel memories are phone calls with his children Brittany, John, Paige and Nicole when they were young. \u201cDad, when are you coming home?\u201d they\u2019d ask, warming his heart.\n\nThe road can be unforgiving. It puts lines on foreheads, dark bags under eyes and aches in backs. But Shiver lives a clean life. He\u2019s an oatmeal and berries kind of guy. If he\u2019s up late these days, it\u2019s because he can\u2019t stop turning the pages of \u201cThe Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\u201d\n\nThe road, and time, are his allies. All the days and nights he has spent traveling separate him from most of his peers.\n\nThe Midwest long has been Shiver\u2019s territory. He knows the Big Ten, the MAC and the Missouri Valley like he knows his clothes drawers.\n\n\u201cFamiliarity is one of the strongest attributes a scout can have,\u201d says Tobin, now a personnel executive with the Bengals.\n\nThere are times when a college coach will give a misleading answer to a sensitive question about a player, and a less experienced talent evaluator might come back to a draft meeting with that information. Then Shiver will come back with the real story \u2014 the one he was given after a subtle eye roll and a hushed conversation in a back hallway when the other scouts were preoccupied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHis experience on our staff is invaluable,\u201d Pace said of the 62-year-old. \u201cThink about the relationships he has established and the resources he has available to him. He can pick up the phone and get information a younger scout can\u2019t. And he has a library of players in his head. In a draft meeting, at the drop of a hat, he\u2019ll say this player reminds me of that player for this reason. It\u2019s awesome. Sometimes he\u2019ll go way back, nobody remembers the player.\u201d\n\nShiver says Montgomery, for instance, reminds him a little of Matt Forte. Some comparisons are off-limits, however. \u201cOne thing you never do is compare anybody to Walter Payton,\u201d he said.\n\nIf not for Shiver, the Bears might not have drafted Anthony \u201cA-Train\u201d Thomas, the 2001 NFL offensive rookie of the year. Then-personnel boss Mark Hatley initially was inclined to select a player at another position in the second round, but Shiver appealed to him to take Thomas because the drop-off at the position was steep.\n\nLater, after Hatley left the Bears to work for the Packers, he called Shiver to tell him he was right about A-Train.\n\n\u201cI give Mark a lot of credit for taking him,\u201d Shiver said. \u201cHe was kind of an ugly runner, an upright, short stepper who ran like a sewing machine, but he was strong, had great vision and he ran hard.\u201d\n\nShiver often provides levity with phrases such as \u201cran like a sewing machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe does a real good job of painting the picture of the player,\u201d Pace said. \u201cHe has a million one liners that crack up the room. He has a way of bringing passion and energy and still keeping it fun.\u201d\n\nJeff Shiver with former Bears personnel director Rod Graves. (Courtesy Jeff Shiver)\n\nAmong other players Shiver has pushed for over the years were Jim Schwantz (as an undrafted free agent), Rosey Colvin, Mike Brown and Kyle Orton.\n\n\u201cHe was a big Kyle Orton fan,\u201d Angelo said. \u201cHe talked about his toughness \u2014 physically and mentally \u2014 his leadership, his passion for the game, and how the guys would rally around him. He pointed out the intangibles that are hard to find out about.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiver always excelled at evaluating character, according to Angelo. That, in part, was why Shiver gave Drew Brees the highest grade he ever gave a quarterback in 2001.\n\nShiver is quicker to talk about his misses than his hits though. He keeps a copy of his report about Tom Brady from 2000 on his phone \u201cto keep me humble.\u201d Shiver had a sixth-round grade on Brady, and made the notation: \u201cBad body award.\u201d\n\nHe also remembers thinking Hatley and scout John Paul Young had lost their minds for thinking they could draft a safety from New Mexico with the ninth pick in 2000 and convert him to an inside linebacker. Turned out Brian Urlacher wasn\u2019t such a bad pick.\n\n\u201cI still laugh about it with John Paul and Brian to this day,\u201d he said.\n\nThe business Shiver is in isn\u2019t the same one he got into all those years ago.\n\nWhen he was hired, he was one of only four college scouts with the Bears, and his territory spanned 1,700 miles from Sue Saint Marie, Mich. to Corpus Christi, Texas. Now Shiver is one of 14 college scouts with the team. While their territories are much smaller than they used to be, scouts are required to scrutinize every prospect more intensely. Instead of working in a 28-team league that had 12 draft rounds, he works in a 32-team league with seven draft rounds.\n\nBack then, college coaches were more honest about their players. Now, a lie detector test might be the most valuable scouting tool.\n\nShiver worked in an era when scouts were able to get to know college coaches because campuses weren\u2019t swarmed with scouting competitors, and coaches didn\u2019t have responsibilities like television shows and social media to draw them away from human interaction.\n\nHe recalls that day in 1988 when Michigan coach Bo Schembechler acknowledged him for the first time during a campus visit.\n\n\u201cFrom a distance, he said, \u2018Hey Shivs, what\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Shiver said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew I had made it at Michigan.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShiver would show up on a campus, projector in one hand, two dozen donuts for the staff in another. He\u2019d borrow a canister of film and watch it on a white wall in a quiet office.\n\nNow most everything is on iPads. Some schools won\u2019t let in scouts but for a few days a year.\n\nThere were no cell phones in Shiver\u2019s early career. Scouts had to call the office once a week and give an update on their travels. All of their reports were written long-hand.\n\nThe most he was allowed to spend on a hotel room was $37. But usually, he got a rate of $20.\n\nScouts have changed too. They\u2019re more educated than they used to be, and less colorful. In the old days most of them were old coaches, yesterday\u2019s heroes who got some of their best information over brown bottles and nuts in a corner of the local VFW. Now they\u2019re ambitious young climbers who are more comfortable looking into computer screens than eyes.\n\nPace is a different kind of boss than Shiver ever had.\n\n\u201cThe thing that strikes me most about him is there is a lot of interaction and discussion, maybe more than I\u2019ve ever been around,\u201d Shiver said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Hey, everybody get your piece said.\u2019 Then we come up with a grade and stick with it. I can\u2019t recall a time with Ryan when the Bears grade on a player has changed significantly late in the process. And I\u2019ve seen it in the past.\u201d\n\nShiver says Pace fosters a culture in which young people can grow. Pace credits Shiver with taking young scouts under his wing and helping them develop. He says Shiver played a big part in the educations of three men who were moved up from scouting assistants to full-time scouts.\n\nShiver finds the environment invigorating. What hasn\u2019t changed is Shiver keeps learning.\n\nIt was former head coach Lovie Smith who used to tell him, \u201cShivs, we can learn from our players if we just listen.\u201d\n\nShivs listens. When he was at the New Orleans Superdome in early 1986 for the scouting combine as a Blesto scout, he watched Cowboys coach Tom Landry taking notes on a loose-leaf notebook. He noticed Landry kept looking at the ground as offensive linemen went through their drills.\n\nFinally, he introduced himself and asked Landry what he was looking at.\n\n\u201cHe said he was looking at their ankles,\u201d Shiver says. \u201cTheir ankles tell you if they can move or not. Bad ankles can\u2019t move. I\u2019ve kept that in mind when I\u2019m looking at offensive linemen ever since.\u201d\n\nFormer Bears coach Dave Wannstedt with Jeff Shiver. (Courtesy Jeff Shiver)\n\nHe also took a different lesson from another coaching legend, Don Shula. The conduit was longtime Dolphins scout Mike Cartwright, who was watching film of a running back with Shiver in the late 1980s. The running back fumbled twice in a game.\n\nCartwright: \u201cI can relax on this one because Shula won\u2019t take him.\u201d\n\nShiver: \u201cWhat do you mean? He\u2019s a great back.\u201d\n\nCartwright: \u201cShula says, \u2018Once a fumbler, always a fumbler.\u2019 It\u2019s the incurable disease in football.\u201d\n\nMany helped Shiver become the scout he is. Mike Ditka taught him a great deal, as did his assistants Jim LaRue and Dick Stanfel. He is grateful for the wisdom imparted from Bears president Ted Phillips and former administration director Bill McGrane.\n\nDuring his first year as a scout, he was timing a kicker running the 40-yard dash at Illinois State. As the kicker crossed the finish line, he veered and ran into Shiver\u2019s outstretched hand, knocking his stopwatch.\n\nShiver yelled at him. \u201cCan\u2019t you run a straight line? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d A chorus of scouts and coaches joined in, heckling the young man. The dejected kicker was supposed to run again, but he didn\u2019t. He walked off and went home. Shiver tried to find him to apologize, but couldn\u2019t.\n\nShiver has thought about it for decades. \u201cI hope,\u201d he says, \u201cthat it wasn\u2019t an unsettling moment in his life.\u201d\n\nThe irony is Shiver has spent a career lifting people with his Southern warmth and grace. He hails from Atmore, Ala., a mill town on the coastal plain between Mobile and Pensacola, Fla., but it\u2019s more apt to say he is from the salt of the earth.\n\nGraves speaks for many when he says, \u201cThere aren\u2019t many people I put higher on my list than Jeff Shiver as a friend and respected professional. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about him. I can honestly say I love the man.\u201d\n\nShiver has made his mark in life with a smile, a firm handshake and good old fashioned sincerity. To say he never met someone who didn\u2019t become his friend is only a slight embellishment.\n\nOne of the first and most important things Shiver learned as a scout was to value everyone in his path \u2014 not just the coaches or people who have something he can benefit from. It\u2019s the everyday folk \u2014 the gas attendant, the custodian, the security guard.\n\n\u201cThe mission,\u201d he says, \u201cnever is greater than the people you come in contact with.\u201d\n\nAt places like The Little Dooey in Starkwood, Miss., Dreamland BBQ in Tuscaloosa, Ala., and Zingerman\u2019s Deli in Ann Arbor, Mich., the food is special enough to make you go out of your way. But it\u2019s the cashiers, waitresses and bus boys that keep drawing Shiver back.\n\nShiver was raised right by his late parents John and Myrtle. Jeff learned how to work from daddy, who was an auto mechanic at Shiver\u2019s Auto Service for more than 80 years, putting in 12 hours a day, six days a week. In World War II, John was a flight engineer and gunner in the Army Air Corps.\n\nMom kept the books and tended to Jeff and his two sisters. He still can feel her love when he bakes Myrtle\u2019s Sour Cream Pound Cake.\n\nAnd on the topic of food preparation, remember that hamburger Shiver was cooking when he got the call to come to Lake Forest? He got caught up on the phone and badly burned it. But he ate it anyway.\n\nSays Shiver, \u201cBy far, the best burger I ever tasted.\u201d\n\n(Top photo of Virginia McCaskey and Jeff Shiver: Courtesy Jeff Shiver)"}, {"url": "https://www.profootballhistory.com/ted-marchibroda/", "page_content": "Back in the day, Ted Marchibroda defied the norm of the typical, fiery NFL head coach.\n\nMarchibroda was the complete opposite \u2013 he was a gentleman on and off the gridiron during his memorable 38-year pro football coaching career.\n\nMarchibroda\u2019s genius on the sidelines helped the Los Angeles Rams, Washington Redskins, Buffalo Bills, and Indianapolis Colts reach unprecedented heights during his multiple coaching stints from 1961 to 1998.\n\nMarchibroda was an important figure and innovator in pro football history.\n\nHe gave Bill Belichick his first NFL job in 1975 and developed the Bills\u2019 vaunted no-huddle \u201cK-Gun\u201d offense during their memorable Super Bowl runs in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nMarchibroda also helped develop hundreds of football players, most notably quarterbacks Billy Kilmer and Jim Kelly.\n\nTed Marchibroda\u2019s contributions to the National Football League will live on forever.\n\nEarly Life And Pro Football Career\n\nTheodore Joseph \u201cTed\u201d Marchibroda was born in Franklin, PA on March 15, 1931.\n\nMarchibroda split his college football career between Saint Bonaventure University and the University of Detroit. His 1,813 passing yards were the most in the country in 1952.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers made former St. Bonaventure Brown Indians and Detroit Titans quarterback Ted Marchibroda the fifth overall selection of the 1953 NFL Draft.\n\nMarchibroda went on a year-long hiatus to serve in the Army in 1954. When he returned to the Steelers a year later, he got Pittsburgh\u2019s final quarterback spot \u2013 a turn of events that ultimately led to Johnny Unitas\u2019 release before the 1955 NFL campaign.\n\nMarchibroda had his best statistical season in 1956. He had 1,585 passing yards, 12 touchdowns, and 19 interceptions in twelve games for the Steelers that year.\n\nSteelers-Browns 65 years ago this week Steelers 1st ever win in Cleveland Ted Marchibroda leads a Pittsburgh comeback from a 13-0 deficit to beat the Browns in Cleveland.

Marchibroda\u2019s two touchdown passes helped the Steelers prevail over the Browns 24-16 in 1956.\n\nWith Marchibroda under center, Pittsburgh had a 5-7 win-loss record in Walt Kiesling\u2019s final year as Steelers head coach in 1956. The squad also missed the postseason for the 23rd time since they entered the National Football League twenty-four years earlier.\n\nTed Marchibroda signed with the Chicago Cardinals prior to the 1957 NFL season. He backed up starting quarterback Lamar McHan and recorded 238 passing yards, one touchdown pass, and five interceptions in five games for Chicago.\n\nTwenty-six-year-old Ted Marchibroda retired from the National Football League following the 1957 NFL campaign.\n\nHe finished his four-year pro football career with 2,169 passing yards, 16 touchdown passes, and 29 interceptions.\n\nAlthough Ted Marchibroda\u2019s stint on the pro gridiron only lasted all of four years, he took on a higher calling \u2013 he embarked on a legendary 38-year coaching career in the National Football League.\n\nFootball Coaching Career\n\nFirst-year Washington Redskins head coach and general manager Bill McPeak hired Ted Marchibroda as one of his assistants for the 1961 NFL season.\n\nMcPeak took over the reins from Mike Nixon, who mustered a combined four wins as Washington\u2019s head coach from 1959 to 1960.\n\nMcPeak tapped Marchibroda despite the latter not having any professional football coaching experience.\n\nNonetheless, 30-year-old Ted Marchibroda had found his calling \u2013 he remained in the NFL coaching ranks for the next thirty-eight years.\n\nWashington team owner George Preston Marshall told Marchibroda to go to South Bend, IN in November 1961.\n\nHis mission: tell 1961 Heisman Trophy-winning running back Ernie Davis of the Syracuse Orangemen the Redskins might select him in the 1962 NFL Draft.\n\nMarchibroda spoke with Davis after the Orangemen\u2019s game against the Notre Dame Fighting Irish.\n\nNot only did Washington select Davis, but they also made him the No. 1 overall selection of the draft.\n\nUnfortunately, Davis didn\u2019t want to play for the Redskins and requested they trade him. The Redskins eventually dealt him to the Cleveland Browns for Bobby Mitchell and Leroy Jackson.\n\nErnie Davis never played a single down in the National Football League. The 23-year-old sensation passed away due to leukemia in May 1963.\n\nThe Redskins weren\u2019t much better during the McPeak era than they had been under Mike Nixon \u2013 they averaged four wins per year from 1961 to 1965\n\nAfter McPeak left the Redskins organization following the 1965 NFL season, Marchibroda joined George Allen\u2019s staff as an assistant with the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nMarchibroda was on Allen\u2019s staff for the entirety of the latter\u2019s head coaching career with the Rams from 1966 to 1970.\n\nUnder Allen\u2019s guidance, the Rams averaged ten wins per year and won two division titles during that time frame. However, they never made it past the Divisional Round in Marchibroda\u2019s five years with the squad.\n\nThrowback Photo \u2013 1969 Los Angeles Rams Coaching Staff.

Quite a Staff!! #NFL100 pic.twitter.com/J6Z0Cicwu3 \u2014 Detroit Blues (@detroitblu3s) November 24, 2019\n\nWhen the Redskins hired Allen as their head coach before the 1971 NFL season, Marchibroda joined him. It was the latter\u2019s second tour of duty in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nMarchibroda served as Allen\u2019s offensive coordinator for four years from 1971 to 1974. The former had been learning the head coaching ropes from Allen for a combined nine years at the end of the 1974 NFL campaign.\n\nThe Redskins were a world away from the team they were during the Bill McPeak era just seven years earlier.\n\nWith the Allen and Marchibroda tandem and stalwarts such as quarterback Billy Kilmer, running back Larry Brown, and wide receivers Charley Taylor and Roy Jefferson, and tight end Jerry Smith, Washington averaged ten wins per year from 1971 to 1974.\n\nNot only did the Redskins end their 25-year postseason drought, but they also made four postseason appearances with Allen and Marchibroda prowling the sidelines.\n\nThe duo led the Redskins to their first Super Bowl appearance against the Miami Dolphins on January 14, 1973. Unfortunately, they lost to Larry Csonka and Co. in Super Bowl VII, 14-7.\n\nKilmer, the quarterback who orchestrated Marchibroda\u2019s offense in Washington, felt his offensive coordinator didn\u2019t show his full potential with the Redskins.\n\nAllen put a premium on defense. He wanted Marchibroda to simplify the Redskins\u2019 offense by relying mainly on Brown\u2019s running game and keeping turnovers and penalties to an absolute minimum.\n\nThat system eventually undermined Marchibroda\u2019s abilities as an offensive coordinator.\n\n\u201cTed was definitely hindered in Washington,\u201d Kilmer told The Washington Post\u2019s Leonard Shapiro in a telephone interview in January 2016. \u201cWe could have done a lot of things we didn\u2019t do. But that wasn\u2019t Ted. That was the head coach.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Kilmer credited his rise as an NFL quarterback to Marchibroda.\n\nKilmer admitted to Shapiro he lacked discipline when he arrived in Washington in 1971 \u2013 the same year Marchibroda began his second tour of duty with the Redskins.\n\nKilmer was more of a single-wing tailback when he played for the UCLA Bruins during his college days. As New Orleans Saints quarterback from 1967 to 1970, he lacked the fundamentals of dropback passing.\n\nTed Marchibroda intervened in Kilmer\u2019s pro football career at the perfect time \u2013 the former taught Kilmer various fundamentals during Redskins practice.\n\nMarchibroda also watched film relentlessly for hours on end. His voracious film habits helped him predict when a defense was going to switch to a blitz package or zone coverage, per The Washington Post.\n\nMarchibroda\u2019s instincts quickly rubbed off on Kilmer, who did the rest on the football field.\n\nThe results were astounding \u2013 Kilmer led Washington in passing yardage for seven straight seasons from 1971 to 1977. Moreover, Kilmer continued picking defenses apart two years after Marchibroda embarked on a head coaching career with Baltimore.\n\nClearly, that was the Ted Marchibroda difference.\n\nLeonard Shapiro, a sports reporter for The Washington Times, called Marchibroda \u201ca world-class gentleman.\u201d\n\nWhen Shapiro covered the Redskins beat full-time in 1973, head coach George Allen put an invisible wall between the team and the media.\n\nIn that regard, Ted Marchibroda was completely different from Allen \u2013 the former was a soft-spoken personality who always provided Shapiro with the information he needed.\n\nHowever, Marchibroda knew when to withhold information such as who will start as quarterback for the Redskins on Sunday.\n\nWhether it was Billy Kilmer or Sonny Jurgensen, Marchibroda only let Shapiro and the rest of the media know why that quarterback started after the final whistle.\n\n\"I'm not going to get involved in the draft. I haven't seen a college game in 10 years.\" \u2014 Baltimore Colts coach Ted Marchibroda, who months later in 1976 gave a kid name Bill Belichick his first NFL job. He got paid $25 a week as an assistant & driver. pic.twitter.com/2Xv9jatMFt \u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) February 5, 2018\n\nMarchibroda earned his first head coaching job with the Baltimore Colts in the 1975 NFL season.\n\nMarchibroda also appointed future New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick as a special assistant that year for $25 per week, per ESPN.\n\nIt was Belichick\u2019s first job in the National Football League \u2013 a career that has spanned 47 years.\n\nThe Colts had won just two games the year before under head coach Thomas Schnellenberger. It was the team\u2019s worst finish since it entered the NFL in 1953.\n\nMarchibroda promptly turned Baltimore\u2019s fortunes around. The Colts averaged ten wins per year in his first three years on the job. Unfortunately, they never made it past the Divisional Round from 1975 to 1977.\n\nNonetheless, Ted Marchibroda proved he belonged in the NFL coaching ranks \u2013 he earned NFL Coach of the Year honors in his first year on the job in 1975.\n\nWith Marchibroda calling the shots for the Colts, quarterback Bert Jones racked up 3,104 passing yards and won 1976 NFL MVP honors.\n\nIronically, Marchibroda\u2019s head coaching tenure in the National Football league almost ended as soon as it began.\n\nMarchibroda abruptly resigned as the Colts\u2019 head coach on September 5, 1976. His resignation stemmed from locker room issues with his owner.\n\nAccording to The New York Times\u2019 William N. Wallace, Marchibroda stood up for his players after Irsay went on a tirade in the locker room following the Colts\u2019 preseason loss to the Detroit Lions at the Pontiac Silverdome.\n\nWhen an irate Irsay berated All-Pro offensive tackle George Kunz after the game, Marchibroda told the Colts owner to hire a new coach.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t have locker room scenes like this every week,\u201d Marchibroda told Wallace in the fall of 1976.\n\nColts running back Lydell Mitchell told The New York Times that Irsay was oblivious to what Marchibroda and the coaching staff were doing \u2013 they benched half of their offensive starters to preserve them for the regular-season grind.\n\nAfter the locker room fiasco in Detroit, Irsay boarded his yacht in Chicago and went on a cruise. Colts general manager Joe Thomas set up a meeting with Irsay and Marchibroda on board the yacht in Milwaukee.\n\nThe three men discussed who had the prerogative to sign and waive players between Marchibroda and Thomas. The Colts\u2019 general manager ultimately prevailed with Irsay\u2019s support.\n\nDespite a six-game turnaround in Marchibroda\u2019s first year at the helm in 1975, Thomas released five veterans including former All-Pro linebacker Mike Curtis and backup quarterback Marty Domres.\n\nTed Marchibroda, the only man to coach both NFL franchises in Baltimore (Colts, Ravens), died Saturday at 84. pic.twitter.com/V6ohjnZIqp \u2014 ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) January 16, 2016\n\nMarchiborda wanted to retain Domres as a backup to Bert Jones, who led the Colts with 2,483 passing yards in 1975.\n\nMarchibroda also tendered his resignation from the Colts a second time on board Irsay\u2019s yacht, per Wallace. The Colts owner accepted his resignation.\n\nJones released a statement on behalf of his teammates following Marchibroda\u2019s departure.\n\nPart of it reads the Colts owner and general manager \u201chave completely destroyed the team by forcing Ted out the week of the first league game,\u201d per The New York Times.\n\nJones also wrote that Marchibroda didn\u2019t have to tolerate abuse at the hands of Irsay and Thomas, which he claimed he had witnessed.\n\nTed Marchibroda\u2019s departure from the Colts was short-lived. Irsay and Thomas asked him to reconsider after offensive coordinator Whitey Dovell and defensive coordinator Maxie Baughan threatened to resign as well.\n\nTo make matters worse for Irsay and Thomas, Colts players also considered boycotting practice to support Marchibroda. However, that plan never materialized.\n\nBaltimore ultimately re-hired Ted Marchibroda on September 8, 1976. After the Colts re-hired him he told The New York Times that he had the ultimate say in football-related matters.\n\nIrsay told Wallace in a telephone conversation that he gave Marchibroda the power to sign and release both players and coaches.\n\nThe Colts regressed considerably in 1978 and 1979. Baltimore won an average of just five games those two seasons and fell out of postseason contention.\n\nThe Colts\u2019 fall from grace started a 10-year postseason drought. They never made the postseason again until 1987 when they were already known as the \u201cIndianapolis Colts.\u201d\n\nColts owner Robert Irsay fired Marchibroda following the 1979 NFL campaign. Little did Marchibroda know Irsay would rehire him some thirteen years later in Indianapolis.\n\nMarchibroda spent the next five seasons as the Chicago Bears\u2019 quarterbacks coach (1981), the Detroit Lions\u2019 offensive coordinator (1982 to 1983), and the Philadelphia Eagles\u2019 offensive coordinator (1984 to 1985).\n\nThe entire Bills organization mourns the passing of Ted Marchibroda, a beloved coach and man. pic.twitter.com/S2AHjzhdgK \u2014 Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) January 16, 2016\n\nTed Marchibroda was one of the architects behind the Buffalo Bills\u2019 resurgence in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nSince the Bills joined the National Football League in 1970, they made the postseason just three times in eighteen years.\n\nThe Buffalos\u2019 fortunes changed dramatically when Ted Marchibroda joined Marv Levy\u2019s staff as the Bills\u2019 quarterbacks coach in 1987.\n\nMarchibroda was the mastermind behind the Bills\u2019 famous \u201cK-Gun\u201d system \u2013 a no-huddle offense that revolved around quarterback Jim Kelly.\n\nMarchibroda helped Kelly earn four Pro Bowl nods from 1987 to 1991. It was a throwback to the former\u2019s days with the Washington Redskiins when he helped developed Billy Kilmer.\n\nIn the bigger scheme of things, Marchibroda\u2019s presence on the sidelines helped Levy and Co. become perennial Super Bowl contenders.\n\nThe Bills promoted Marchibroda to offensive coordinator prior to the 1989 NFL season. He eventually helped them reach the Super Bowl in both 1990 and 1991.\n\nBuffalo made an incredible four consecutive Super Bowl appearances from 1990 to 1993 \u2013 the latter two occurring when Marchibroda was in his second tenure as Colts head coach.\n\nBilly Kilmer, the Redskins quarterback Marchibroda developed two decades earlier, enjoyed watching his former offensive coordinator turn the Bills into a powerhouse, per The Washington Post.\n\nRobert Irsay rehired Marchibroda to coach the Indianapolis Colts in 1992. The latter noted that Irsay\u2019s improved financial situation allowed him to sign the players the Colts needed.\n\n\u201cIn Indianapolis he gave me pretty much everything I needed to win,\u201d Marchibroda told The Baltimore Sun. \u201cHe spent money and gave the coach everything to win. I think it was easier for him in Indianapolis.\u201d\n\nMarchibroda had a daunting task \u2013 the woebegone Colts won just one game all season long in 1991. He also had to manage volatile third-year quarterback Jeff George, the first overall selection of the 1990 NFL Draft who wasn\u2019t meeting expectations.\n\nAfter averaging barely seven wins in 1992 and 1993, the Colts jettisoned a disgruntled George to the Atlanta Falcons prior to the 1994 NFL campaign. They signed former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim Harbaugh several weeks later.\n\nIndianapolis averaged nine wins per year in Ted Marchibroda\u2019s last two years at the helm from 1994 to 1995.\n\nMarchibroda helped the Colts reach the 1995 AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Regrettably, Indianapolis lost 20-16 after wide receiver Aaron Bailey dropped Harbaugh\u2019s desperation Hail Mary in the waning moments of the game.\n\nThat turned out to be Ted Marchibroda\u2019s final game with the Colts.\n\nOne Colts player whom Marchibroda endeared himself to was defensive tackle, Tony Siragusa. The latter loathed Indianapolis director of football operations Bill Tobin for rejecting Marchibroda\u2019s demand for a two-year contract extension.\n\nConsequently, Marchibroda left the Colts on February 9, 1996. He didn\u2019t have to wait long, though \u2013 the Baltimore Ravens named him their first-ever head coach just six days later.\n\nMarchibroda had come full circle \u2013 he returned to the Charm City exactly twenty-one years and one month after Jim Irsay hired him to become the Baltimore Colts head coach in 1975, per Garrett Downing of BaltimoreRavens.com.\n\nThe then Ravens executive vice president for player personnel Ozzie Newsome considered Marchibroda the team\u2019s founding father.\n\nSiragusa joined his former coach with the Colts in the 1997 NFL season. The former considered Marchibroda an important father figure.\n\n\u201cHe was like a father to me,\u201d Siragusa told Downing in January 2016. \u201cHe made me believe in myself and extended my career with his coaching.\u201d\n\nWith Marchibroda calling the shots, the Ravens averaged five wins per year during their first three years of existence from 1996 to 1998.\n\nTed Marchibroda retired from the pro football coaching profession following the 1997 NFL campaign.\n\nMarchibroda had a combined 87-98-1 record as Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts and Baltimore Ravens head coach over a twelve-year span from 1975 to 1979 and 1992 to 1998.\n\nPost-Football Life And Death\n\nTed Marchibroda and his wife Ann have four children: daughters Jodi and Lonni and sons Ted Jr. and Robert.\n\nMarchibroda was an Indianapolis Colts radio color commentator together with Bob Lamey from 1999 to 2006.\n\nThe team made him the first coach inducted into the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor in 2000.\n\nSadly, Ted Marchibroda passed away on January 17, 2016.

He also was director of player personnel for the Detroit Lions in 2001. During his time with the Indianapolis Colts he drafted Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk and future Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison. He also drafted Ken Dilger, Tarik Glenn and Adam Meadows, who would be cornerstones of the Colts offensive line. He drafted Ray Buchanan and Ashley Ambrose who came to be tremendous players in the league and eventually started for the Falcons in the Super Bowl. lieutenant could be argued that Bill Tobin laid the foundation for the Peyton Manning era because of quality players he drafted. Tobin was replaced as Colts general manager in 1997 by Bill Polian. Tobin is the brother of former NFL coach Vince Tobin. Tobin is currently working as a scout for the Cincinnati Bengals. While general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, Tobin gained some notoriety during the television broadcast of the 1994 NFL Draft after being criticized by Entertainment and Sports Programming Network analyst Mel Kiper for picking Nebraska linebacker Trev Alberts with the fifth pick in the draft, instead of Fresno State quarterback Trent Dilfer. While being interviewed by Entertainment and Sports Programming Network later in the broadcast, Tobin famously said \"Who the hell is Mel Kiper?!\" Tobin later called a press conference where he ranted about Kiper for several minutes, stating that Kiper had been biased against the Colts ever since they moved from Baltimore, Kiper\"s home."}, {"url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-08-09-0108090240-story.html", "page_content": "SAGINAW, Mich. \u2014 The Tobin brothers are back in the NFL with new ammunition, ready to win again. Bill Tobin is executive director of player personnel and Vince Tobin is defensive coordinator of the Detroit Lions.\n\nThey won together with the Bears. They won together with the Indianapolis Colts. Vince won with the Arizona Cardinals. Bill has been out of the league for three years, but after new Lions President Matt Millen hired him, Bill received a note from Colts owner Jim Irsay thanking him for getting the Colts up and running.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVince was fired and replaced by defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis after a 2-5 start last season.\n\nAfter Millen hired Bill, he called Vince and asked: \"Can you work with your brother?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVince had been at the top of new coach Marty Mornhinweg's list of defensive coordinators.\n\nMillen and Mornhinweg are new at their jobs and admit they don't mind leaning on the Tobins.\n\n\"Lean on them all the time,\" Millen said. \"I'd be stupid if I wouldn't.\"\n\nMillen inquired about hiring former Bears pro personnel director Rick Spielman, but Dave Wannstedt and the Miami Dolphins had him locked up. Millen knew Tobin from the time former Penn State teammate Matt Suhey played for the Bears.\n\n\"With Bill, there's not a lot of gray area,\" Millen said. \"He'll give me an opinion. There's been a couple times when I'll say, `I disagree,' and he'll say, `Well, that's what I think.'\"\n\nThe track records are clear. The Bears' drafts during Bill Tobin's scouting and personnel tenure from 1975-93 were arguably the best in the NFL. Vince Tobin had the unenviable task of taking over Buddy Ryan's popular defense from the 1985 Super Bowl season, completely changed the style and set the NFL record for fewest points in 1986, a record that stood until the Baltimore Ravens broke it last season.\n\nWhen former Colts owner Bob Irsay died, Jim wanted his own man, Bill Polian, to take over. But Irsay recognized that Tobin's drafts--including Marshall Faulk, Marvin Harrison, tackles Tarik Glenn and Adam Meadows, tight end Ken Dilger and defensive tackle Ellis Johnson--plus responsible management of the salary cap not only put the Colts into two playoffs but positioned them for the future.\n\nTobin interviewed for the New Orleans job after coach Mike Ditka and general manager Bill Kuharich were fired.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I don't know if people are afraid of his age (61) or his stubbornness, but he knows a player,\" Millen said.\n\nTobin stubbornly sticks by his players. When the Lions needed a backup quarterback to replace Mike Tomczak--a Tobin free-agent signee in Chicago in 1985--they called on Jim Harbaugh, drafted No. 1 by Tobin in Chicago and brought to Indianapolis.\n\nWhen Millen did homework as a Fox television analyst, he found he and Tobin thought alike not only on players but on managerial structure of a team. The Lions fired coach Bobby Ross, who had more power than previous Lions coaches. It is a leaguewide trend for coaches to get final say on personnel. Bill Tobin says beware.\n\n\"There are not enough hours in a day and not enough brains in the head for one man to do it,\" Tobin said. \"When Jimmy Johnson got total control in Miami, he didn't do as well as he did with Jerry Jones in Dallas. Bill Parcells was better with George Young (Giants). Ditka was a lot better when I was with him in Chicago. [Mike] Holmgren was better in Green Bay with Ron Wolf than he is in Seattle.\n\n\"[Denver coach Mike] Shanahan is the only true exception.\"\n\nWhen Vince Tobin arrived in Detroit, the sight of all the Lions' players signed was a new experience. His first year in Arizona in 1996, not a single draft choice was signed at the start of camp. By 1998, Vince had the Cardinals in the playoffs, where they won their first postseason game since 1947.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut constant player contract hassles--plus forcing Vince to coach as a lame duck last season--eroded whatever momentum was building.\n\n\"I enjoyed being a head coach; I'm sorry it didn't work,\" Vince said. \"Their overall plan wasn't, `What can we do to get better and stay up here?' It was, `How do we survive and try to be competitive?'\"\n\nNow Vince looks forward to \"the chess game on the sidelines,\" where he will have more control over his fate.\n\n\"One reason I liked him is I coached against his defenses,\" Mornhinweg said. \"There are a lot of guys who are coordinators in this league using his system.\"\n\nMcGinnis, new Houston head coach Dom Capers, the Bears' Greg Blache, Philadelphia's Jim Johnson, the Colts' Vic Fangio and Arizona's Larry Marmie all have worked with Tobin.\n\n\"His defenses are always solid,\" Millen said. \"I'm fine with both Tobins. They hold their cards real close and I like that. They both aren't afraid to speak their mind.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Lions open their exhibition season Friday night against Cincinnati. The Bengals' college scout is Duke Tobin, Bill's son and Vince's nephew. They'll talk this week, but probably won't tell each other much.\n\nTogether again\n\nThe Detroit Lions are the third team Bill and Vince Tobin have worked for at the same time.\n\nBILL TOBIN\n\n1975-1993: Bears\n\nVarious capacities\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1994-1997: Colts\n\nVice president and director of football operations\n\n2001: Lions\n\nVice president of player Personnel\n\nVINCE TOBIN\n\n1986-1992: Bears\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefensive coordinator\n\n1994-1995: Colts\n\nDefensive coordinator\n\n2001: Lions\n\nDefensive coordinator\n\nSource: Detroit Lions, NFL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChicago Tribune."}, {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2424954-the-one-that-got-away-nfl-execs-tell-the-tales-of-their-biggest-draft-misses", "page_content": "B/R via AP Images\n\nAs Bill Tobin prepared to leave his suburban Chicago home shortly before sunup on May 4, 1979, his wife Dusene asked him who he thought the Bears would draft that day. They were thinking about defensive lineman Dan Hampton and linebacker Al Harris in the first round, he told her. And he was certain who the Bears would select in Round 3. That would be Notre Dame quarterback Joe Montana.\n\nIn all of the team's preparatory discussions, the only possibility the Bears considered in the third round was Montana. They had given themselves Montana in every mock draft they had prepared in the month leading up to the event. Tobin, in fact, said he had Montana rated as a first-round talent, and the Bears' inside connections with the Notre Dame coaching staff had given them a good feel for everything Montana could become.\n\nIn the draft room that day were team founder George Halas, general manager Jim Finks, treasurer Jerry Vainisi, assistant to the GM Bill McGrane, head coach Neill Armstrong and top scouts Jim Parmer and Tobin. After the Dolphins chose tight end Ronnie Lee with the ninth pick in the third round, several in the room exhaled. The Bears were up and Montana was available. Tobin's heart began to race. Vainisi said he stood and removed a magnet with Montana's name on it from the bullpen area of the team's draft board. He placed it under the Bears' picks.\n\nAnd then Finks, clearly in command, spoke up. \"Put him back in the bullpen,\" Finks said, according to Vainisi. Finks then expressed concern about a crowded quarterback depth chart. The Bears had Bob Avellini as their starter, and he was being pushed by Mike Phipps. Vince Evans had been showing great ability in practices. Why, Finks asked, should we muddy the waters with another quarterback? And then Finks started talking about how he was uncomfortable with the running backs behind Walter Payton.\n\nBy now the Bears were deep into the allotted time on the draft clock. As the seconds wound down, Finks announced the Bears would take Willie McClendon from Georgia, the highest-rated running back remaining on the Bears' board.\n\n\"I was stunned,\" Vainisi said.\n\n\"Bill Tobin almost had apoplexy,\" McGrane said. \"He was beside himself, sick he didn't get Montana.\"\n\nLENNY IGNELZI/Associated Press\n\nMcClendon lasted four years in the NFL and never rushed for more than 160 yards in a season. If the Bears had chosen Montana, and Montana had become Montana in Chicago, they could have ruled the 1980s with dominance on both sides of the ball. They almost certainly would not have lost to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Games following the 1984 and 1988 seasons. And the Bears' 1979 draft class, with Hampton and Montana, would have been remembered as one of the most transcendent in history.\n\nFinks, who died in 1994, is classified as a great general manager by all who knew him or studied what he did. But like everyone who ever drafted, Finks made regrettable decisions.\n\nEvery drafter has a story about \"the one that got away.\"\n\nTobin has another story about one that got away, but this story has been buried in the \"Who the hell is Mel Kiper?\" story.\n\nThe Colts came into the 1994 draft with the second and seventh overall picks, the latter of which they had acquired from the Falcons for quarterback Jeff George. Tobin, recently named Indianapolis' director of football operations, had just begun a rebuild and was ready to put his mark on the team. With the second overall selection, he chose running back Marshall Faulk. He moved up from the seventh pick to the fifth and took outside linebacker Trev Alberts.\n\nThis did not sit very well with ESPN draft expert Kiper, who strongly believed the Colts should have taken a quarterback. The Redskins chose Heath Shuler with the third pick, and the Bucs took Trent Dilfer with the sixth. When Kiper criticized Tobin for selecting Alberts instead of Dilfer, Tobin went off on the now-famous \"Who the hell is Mel Kiper?\" rant.\n\nWhat few people know is Tobin's initial target in a trade-up was neither Alberts nor a quarterback. In Tobin's estimation, neither Shuler nor Dilfer were worth taking so high. That's why he had signed free-agent quarterback Jim Harbaugh prior to the draft. The player Tobin really wanted with his second pick in the first round was outside linebacker Willie McGinest.\n\n\"I was talking with New England [which had No. 4], trying to trade up to take McGinest,\" Tobin said. \"I called the Redskins [No. 3] too. Alberts was my fallback. Alberts didn't turn out the way we hoped, but Faulk is in the Hall of Fame and Harbaugh was the AFC Player of the Year the following year and is in the Colts' Ring of Honor. If we had been able to get McGinest on top of that, it would have been something.\"\n\nELISE AMENDOLA/Associated Press\n\nMcGinest became a linchpin of three Super Bowl winners in New England and a player who regularly tormented the Colts. Alberts wound up with four career sacks\u201412 fewer than McGinest had in postseason games alone. If McGinest had been a Colt instead of a Patriot, the fragile balance of power may have shifted in the AFC.\n\nMcGinest is not the only outstanding pass-rusher who qualifies as one that got away. In fact, there is one pass-rusher who is identified as the one that got away from at least three teams. The Bears had the fourth pick in the 2005 draft, the Redskins had the ninth and the Lions had the 10th. All of them could have used a pass-rusher\u2014someone like DeMarcus Ware.\n\nAfter ranking 32nd in offense in the NFL the previous season, the Bears felt they needed to focus on that side of the ball. They selected running back Cedric Benson, who topped out at 674 yards in three years with Chicago and eventually was cut after off-field problems.\n\n\"In that draft, we dismissed defensive players, in particular DeMarcus Ware, because we felt we needed to bring some juice to the offense,\" former Bears general manager Jerry Angelo said. \"We were fixed on that. If we had been more open-minded and stayed true to who we were, we would have taken Ware. He would have had a much greater impact on our team, because we had Thomas Jones at running back.\n\n\"Ware would have played into the strength of who we were. We should have spent more time looking at him because we would have seen how special he was.\"\n\nThe Redskins, meanwhile, were focused on another need: cornerback. They picked Carlos Rogers ahead of Ware, and then had to deal with Ware twice a year for nine years after the Cowboys made him the 11th selection of the first round. Eleven of Ware's 127 career sacks have come against the Redskins.\n\nLM Otero/Associated Press\n\n\"We liked Ware, but we needed corners badly,\" said Vinny Cerrato, who was the Redskins' vice president of football operations at the time. \"Ware was kind of a project out of Troy. We had Carlos rated high too. He made a Pro Bowl, and if he could have caught the football, he would have made three or four Pro Bowls. He dropped a lot of interceptions.\"\n\nFormer Lions CEO Matt Millen was desperate for a home run pick in 2005, and then a high, hanging curveball came his way. He had Ware rated as the best pass-rusher in the draft and the fourth- or fifth-best player at any position. So Millen's eyes got big when Ware slipped to his pick, 10th overall.\n\n\"The draft fell perfect for us,\" Millen said. \"Lo and behold, there he is. We needed a pass-rusher bad. DeMarcus was the guy I targeted. I couldn't believe it. I turned and said, 'Get DeMarcus on the phone.'\"\n\nAt that point, a conversation started in the Lions' draft room. Millen recalls offensive coordinator Ted Tollner pushing to take wide receiver Mike Williams. Then head coach Steve Mariucci got on board. \"I said, 'OK, if you think he's going to make that big a difference, we'll do it,'\" Millen said. \"But as soon as I did it, it didn't feel right.\"\n\nThe Lions had used first-round picks in the previous two drafts on wide receivers Charles Rogers and Roy Williams, so most of the draft audience was stunned by the move\u2014especially because questions had been raised about Mike Williams' conditioning, commitment and play speed.\n\nMillen's son Matthew, who was in the draft room, famously punched his father after the selection. Matt understands why. \"All those talks should have been taken care of already,\" Millen said. \"I allowed it to happen, and I caved like a freaking idiot. It was nobody's fault but my own. It still bugs me.\"\n\nThe Lions were right about Ware and wrong about Williams. Dead wrong. Millen said most of the money from Williams' rookie contract came back to the Lions in fines.\n\n\"You name it, he did it,\" Millen said. \"He didn't show up for meetings. He was late. He skipped things. He was overweight. He just didn't get it.\"\n\nThe Millen Lions never recovered from his \"one that got away.\" Jimmy Johnson's Cowboys, on the other hand, recovered quite gracefully from his.\n\nThese days, Johnson has become quite the fisherman down in the Florida Keys. If he chose, he could talk all day about ones that got away. But Johnson prefers to talk about the ones he got on the boat. Always has. Those aren't always the best stories, though.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, Johnson was an unproven head coach of the Cowboys with a maverick style. Even though Johnson had the 21st pick in the draft, he was still trying to acquire the player he rated as the best at any position: linebacker Junior Seau.\n\nKeith Srakocic/Associated Press\n\n\"I really, really wanted him,\" Johnson said. \"I'm sure I made phone calls to the first four or five teams before he was picked. I couldn't get a deal done. But I thought he was a great, great player.\"\n\nThe Cowboys already had young Troy Aikman and Michael Irvin on offense. And Johnson thought they were set at running back after signing a Plan B free agent from Cleveland that offseason: Keith \"End Zone\" Jones.\n\n\"I thought he was going to be our guy,\" Johnson said. So Johnson was intent on adding a defensive player.\n\nAs it turned out, all of the defensive players Johnson liked were taken well before the Cowboys' pick. Johnson was looking at taking running back Rodney Hampton with the 21st pick. But there was another running back he liked more\u2014so much more that he had him rated as the fourth overall player in the draft. Johnson was able to arrange a deal with the Steelers to move up four spots. That's where he chose Emmitt Smith.\n\n\"End Zone\" Jones blew out a lumbar disc before the season began and never played a down for the Cowboys. Smith went on to a Hall of Fame career and helped the Cowboys win a trio of Super Bowls.\n\nFor Bill Parcells, the one that got away came in the 1984 supplemental USFL draft. The Bucs chose quarterback Steve Young first, and then the Oilers selected running back Mike Rozier. With the third pick, Parcells' Giants chose a player who would have a Hall of Fame career. But they passed up a player who could have given them a dynasty.\n\nParcells recalls the team was drawn to offensive tackle Gary Zimmerman because the Giants needed offensive linemen, and their defense already was strong with promising outside linebacker Lawrence Taylor. So the late, great general manager George Young chose Zimmerman\u2014ahead of defensive lineman Reggie White.\n\nJERRY REDFERN/Associated Press\n\n\"I was not in charge of the draft, but it was not a big argument,\" Parcells said. \"We had them rated closely.\"\n\nAs it turned out, Zimmerman did not want to play for the Giants, so the team traded him to the Vikings for a pair of second-round picks they later would use to select defensive back Mark Collins and safety Greg Lasker.\n\nOne pick after the Giants, the Eagles, of all teams, chose White.\n\n\"The first game that year, we played Philadelphia,\" Parcells said. \"I think he got two sacks. He was playing defensive tackle, and he wasn't playing every down yet. I remember telling my coaches, 'We're going to have to deal with this guy for a long time.' It was pretty obvious right away. Looking back on it, had we chosen Reggie, I think our defense, which was pretty dominant as it was, would have been really exceptionally strong for a good length of time.\n\n\"The combination of Reggie White and Lawrence Taylor would have been something special.\"\n\nAnd they would have been playing in game plans designed by Bill Belichick.\n\nThe Packers also could have put together a duo for the ages\u2014a quarterback-wide receiver duo. The one that got away from Ron Wolf was Randy Moss.\n\nWolf will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this August, and he is regarded as one of the best talent evaluators in NFL history. As Wolf prepared for the 1998 draft, he recognized Moss' unique ability. But the Packers general manager never seriously considered Moss because of his checkered past.\n\n\"In Green Bay, Wisconsin, if your player runs a traffic light, that is the lead story on the 6 o'clock news,\" Wolf said. \"So we were very, very careful about the people we brought in. I didn't do my due diligence on him like I should have. It was a bad job on my part.\"\n\nWith the 19th selection in the first round, the Packers chose defensive end Vonnie Holliday, who had a 15-year career but never became an elite player. Two picks later, the Vikings selected Moss.\n\nIn his 14-year career, Moss had more receiving yards (1,320) and more touchdowns (14) against the Packers than any other team. So by the time Moss \"mooned\" Packers fans at Lambeau Field during a playoff game in 2005, Wolf had already seen more of the wide receiver than he ever cared to.\n\nWinslow Townson/Associated Press\n\nMoss, one of the most productive and dynamic wide receivers ever, almost certainly would have had an even more prolific career if he had been paired with gunslinger Brett Favre, a kindred football spirit.\n\n\"Favre and Moss would have really been something,\" Wolf said. \"Moss demonstrated he was a quality, quality player. To my knowledge, never had any [major] problems. That's one I'd like to do over.\"\n\nMany teams probably would like a do-over when it comes to Russell Wilson\u2014none more than the Eagles.\n\nJoe Banner, who was the Eagles president in 2012, recalls Philadelphia having a first-round grade on Wilson, but the team believed he would be available when they were scheduled to make a selection with the 25th pick in the third round. They used second-round picks on linebacker Mychal Kendricks and defensive end Vinny Curry.\n\n\"Considering what Russell has turned out to be and how high we had him graded, we should have used one of those picks on him and not outsmarted ourselves,\" Banner said. \"Howie [Roseman] and Andy [Reid] had so much enthusiasm for him. We thought if he were 6'3\", he'd be the first pick in the draft with no debate. We were all invested and excited. We thought he was going to be our quarterback of the future.\"\n\nIt would have been interesting to see the reaction of Eagles fans if their team had drafted a 5'11\" quarterback.\n\n\"I wasn't really worried about his height,\" said Reid, who has a history of strong quarterback evaluation. \"I thought he could function. He didn't look small behind the biggest line in the country at Wisconsin. He was a big Drew Brees fan and fit his game after his. He had natural leadership ability and was smart\u2014those are two good qualities. He won you over with his attitude and desire to be great.\"\n\nMichael Perez/Associated Press\n\nAs fate would have it, the Seahawks chose Wilson with the 12th pick in the third round. Thirteen picks later, the Eagles chose quarterback Nick Foles.\n\nThe man who drafted Wilson, Seahawks general manager John Schneider, once worked down the hall from Reid in Green Bay. They shared thoughts and watched tape together when the Packers were drafting quarterbacks like Mark Brunell. So it is not a surprise that they were of like mind on Wilson.\n\nThe most interesting part of the story might be that both Wilson and Foles could have been Eagles. Back in Green Bay when Reid worked with Wolf, he came to appreciate the value of stockpiling the quarterback position.\n\n\"If we could have, we would have taken Russell in the third round and Nick in the fourth,\" said Reid, now head coach of the Chiefs. \"It would have been great competition.\"\n\nMaybe Reid still would be coaching the Eagles. Maybe the Seahawks never would have played in a Super Bowl. Maybe Wilson would have become an NFL MVP in Chip Kelly's offense.\n\nInstead, he's one of the ones that got away. One of the missed opportunities that changed the course of NFL history.\n\nDan Pompei covers the NFL for Bleacher Report."}]}
