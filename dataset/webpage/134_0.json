{"Wayne Allyn Root was born on July 20, 1961.": [{"url": "https://infogalactic.com/info/Wayne_Allyn_Root", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nWayne Allyn Root (born July 20, 1961) is an American businessman, author, politician, television and radio personality, television producer, and political commentator. He was the 2008 Libertarian Party (LP) vice-presidential nominee. Root is a former CNBC host and anchorman, and a columnist and commentator for FoxNews.com. Root is a frequent guest on several nationally syndicated radio shows such as Savage Nation, The Jerry Doyle Show, and Mancow's Morning Madhouse. He makes frequent appearances on various programs on the Fox News Channel, and is a frequent speaker at Tea Party events across the United States.[3]\n\nAt the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, Root was eliminated on the fifth ballot in a bid for the party's presidential nomination. He subsequently became the 2008 LP vice presidential candidate alongside Libertarian nominee Bob Barr. In 2010, Root was elected to the Libertarian National Committee (LNC) and re-elected in 2012. He resigned from that position later that year to rejoin the Republican Party. He was later named as Executive Vice Chairman of The Conservative Caucus (TCC) in Washington D.C. Root stated that he was exploring a run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2016, but instead dedicated his efforts to supporting the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. He did not rule out later campaigns.\n\nRoot's political columns appear on various conservative web sites, including FoxNews.com, TheBlaze.com, HumanEvents.com, Townhall.com, Breitbart.com, Dailycaller.com, PersonalLiberty.com, as well as The Washington Times.\n\nHis national television show \"The Wayne Allyn Root Show\" is broadcast by Newsmax TV. Root is an opinion columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRoot was born in Mount Vernon, New York in 1961, the son of the late David and Stella Root. His father was a butcher from Bronxville, New York, who dabbled in third party politics as one of the original founders of the New York State Conservative Party.[4]\n\nRoot graduated as Valedictorian from his high school, Thornton-Donovan School, then graduated from Columbia University in 1983 as a Political Science major. This would place him in the same graduating class as President Barack Obama.[5] Root has stated that he has no recollection of having ever met or seen Obama at Columbia.[5][6] He believes that Obama was born in the United States, but pretended to Columbia to be a foreign student to receive some form of student aid. This subterfuge was later allegedly covered up by the university.\n\nCareer\n\nSports handicapper\n\nRoot's TV handicapping career began in New York City on WNBC radio (now WFAN) in the early 1980s. He moved onto NBC \"Source Radio Network\" syndicated around the country in over 100 markets as a sports talk host. He later became one of the youngest anchormen and national TV hosts in America from 1989 through the early 1990s on Financial News Network (FNN), now known as CNBC. In 2018 he launched a new sports betting information website.[7]\n\nTV producer and personality\n\nRoot is Founder and Chairman of Winning Edge International Inc.[8] In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.\n\nRoot was the creator, executive producer and co-host (along with HBO's Max Kellerman) of King of Vegas on Spike TV. He is a producer of Ghost Adventures on Travel Channel.[9]\n\nAuthor\n\nRoot is the author of several non-fiction books, including The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide and The Murder of the Middle Class. Other books include The Zen of Gambling,The Joy of Failure!, The King of Vegas' Guide to Gambling, Millionaire Republican, and The Conscience of a Libertarian: Empowering the Citizen Revolution with God, Guns, Gold & Tax Cuts. Root's latest book, released in 2015, is The Power of Relentless: 7 Secrets to Achieving Mega-Success, Financial Freedom and the Life of Your Dreams.\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party.[10] He wrote a book on his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, which was published in 2009.[10]\n\nIn September 2012, Root left the LP and announced his return to major party politics.[11][12]\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination on Las Vegas' Fox 5 television station.[13] On February 5, 2008, he placed second in the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary with 18% of the vote (47% voted for \"Uncommitted\"). He came in second in Arizona and third in California, without campaigning in any of these states.[4]\n\nOn May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the LP presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who went on to the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the LP vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.[14]\n\nLibertarian National Committee\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party of the United States. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228\u2013281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member.[15]\n\nIn July 2011 Root was elected chair of the \"Libertarian National Congressional Committee\", a Federal Elections Commission registered entity.[16][17] He renamed it the \"Libertarian National Campaign Committee.\"[18]\n\nAt the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the \"top-down faction.\"[19] The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.[20]\n\nIn a September 2012 letter, he resigned all Libertarian Party positions, saying he would seek a Senate seat \"outside of a third party.\"[11][12]\n\nReturn to Republican Party in 2012\n\nIn September 2012, Root re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.[21][12] He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".[22]\n\nFollowing Romney's defeat in the election,[23] Root commented in a Fox News editorial: \"Well, I was wrong. The 2012 electorate looked almost identical to 2008. Obama's supporters didn\u2019t just come for a second helping of misery\u2014they came out enthusiastically and even appeared to cheer for more.\"[24]\n\nU.S. Senate campaign efforts and beyond\n\nRoot announced that he intended to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Nevada, the seat that was held by Democratic Senator Harry Reid.[12] However, in the end he did not run.\n\nHe supported Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[25]\n\nRoot was opening speaker for Donald Trump's kick-off rally in Las Vegas during the 2016 presidential campaign. At the rally, Root strongly criticized the planned social and economic policies of Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, comparing them to the suicidal outcome of \"Thelma and Louise\".[26] Root continued to support Trump in office.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nRoot supports smaller government, reduced spending, reduced entitlements, reduced bureaucracy, dramatically lower taxes, and greater personal freedom for all individuals. In the area of education, he supports more parental control, more emphasis on school choice (moving education to the state and local level), and increased competition through vouchers. Root and his wife choose to home-school their children. He is also a strong supporter of gun rights for the individual. Root is a small businessman who believes the 2-party system is built on corruption, greed and bribery. He is a fiscal conservative. He believes most social issues should be determined at the state and local level.[4] Root calls for the repeal of the income tax and favors replacing it, as well as all other sources of federal tax revenues, with a tax on each state in proportion to its population, with each state deciding for itself how to raise its share of the money,[27] as is mentioned in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDuring the Ebola epidemic, Root said that President Obama must be impeached \"before he kills us all\" with terrorists who have the Ebola virus.[28][29] Root also makes extreme voter fraud allegations, saying President Obama only won reelection because \u201cDemocratic voters across this country are voting four times, five times, 10 times each for the Democrats.\u201d[30] Root wrote a column that said Obama was using the Ferguson protests as part of \"his plan to destroy this country.\"[31]\n\nIn another published commentary, Root speculated that President Obama attended Columbia University as a foreign exchange student, citing his \"gut instinct\" as evidence, and that President Obama was indoctrinated into Marxism while attending Columbia. Root was specifically referring to the fact that Obama's childhood years spent with his mother in Indonesia. In response to Senator Harry Reid's speculation about Mitt Romney's tax returns, Root offered speculation on Obama's college records.[32][33][34]\n\nAfter being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, Root wrote a column in May 2015 calling the audit \"a political conspiracy coordinated by leading Democrats to either destroy me, bankrupt me, or silence me.\"[35]\n\nRoot appeared on The Daily Show program in 2013, where he accused the IRS of profiling him for his political beliefs while he simultaneously spoke in favor of profiling certain racial, ethnic, and religious groups; Root later complained that The Daily Show \"literally committed fraud\" with selective editing.[36][37]\n\nRoot's theories involving Hillary Clinton include his speculation that Clinton is blackmailing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid prosecution and that Clinton was conspiring with the ACORN organization to steal the 2016 presidential election, even though ACORN no longer existed at that time.[38][39]\n\nIn a Twitter post reacting to the Supreme Court's upholding of Obamacare, Root said he believed that Chief Justice John Roberts is also being \"blackmailed or intimidated,\" which he added is \"like John Boehner\"[40][41]\n\nPersonal life\n\nRoot resides in Henderson, Nevada with his wife Debra. The couple has four children. He is distantly related to advertising pioneer Dave Berg.[42][43]\n\nBibliography\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nAngry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America - and What We Can All Do to Save the Middle Class. 2017.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found."}, {"url": "https://factsbuddy.com/wayne-allyn-root/", "page_content": "Wayne Allyn Root Bio | Wiki\n\nWayne Allyn Root is a popular American conservative radio host, author, activist, far-right political commentator, and conspiracy theorist.

From 1989 to 1991, he worked with the Financial News Network before its subsumption into CNBC.\n\nRoot was founder and chairman of Winning Edge International Inc.

In 2010 Norwegian authorities suspended WMI's sales, finding it to be an illegal pyramid scheme. Root was named in the finding.\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. He ran for a seat on the Westchester County Board of Legislators in 1983. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party. Root's book outlining his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, was published in 2009.\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination. On May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the Libertarian Party presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who became the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.\n\nThough in the same graduating class as Barack Obama at Columbia University, Root has stated on a number of occasions that he has no recollection of having met or seen Obama at Columbia. He has \"stopped short\" of actually claiming that Obama did not attend Columbia.\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228\u2013281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an at-large member. At the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the \"top-down faction.\" The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.\n\nReturn to the Republican Party\n\nIn September 2012, Root resigned all Libertarian Party positions, re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".\n\nRoot had announced that he intended to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2016, for the seat held by retiring Democratic Senator Harry Reid. However, he did not run. He supported Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRoot was the opening speaker for Trump's rally in Las Vegas in late October 2016 during the presidential campaign. At the rally, Root, suggested that he wished ill upon Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, hoping they met the same ending as Thelma & Louise. The lead characters in the film take their own lives by driving off a cliff. In his speech, Root said \"Trump warriors\" armed with \"pitchforks, jack hammers and blow torches\" would violently take over Washington D.C.: \"We're coming to tear it down. We're coming to rip it up. We're coming to kick your ass. And we're coming to put you in prison\", he said referring to a fantasy he had about Clinton and Abedin. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, later told CNN that Root's \"conduct is completely unacceptable and does not reflect our campaign or our candidate\".\n\nIn August 2019, Root praised President Trump. Following Trump's assertion that Jews voting for the Democrats show \"either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\", a comment which was rejected by his critics who said he was following an antisemitic canard, Root countered the claim. Root said that \"Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world...and the Jewish people in Israel love him like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God.\" Later, President Donald Trump thanked Root on Twitter for \"the very nice words\" and shared what was said about him.\n\nIn October 2019, while speaking at a pro-Trump conference in Miami, Florida at the Trump National Doral Miami, Root reportedly boasted about a time in his childhood when, as one of the few white students at a predominantly black high school, he knocked one classmate unconscious and shattered another kid's teeth. \"My buddies and I were high-fiving and laughing,\" Root reportedly said during his speech. \"Man, it was funny.\" He reportedly went on to say that \"you've got to be a natural-born killer\" to win in politics.\n\nPromotion of conspiracy theories and falsehoods\n\nRoot is known for spreading conspiracy theories and false information.\n\nRoot was a leading proponent of the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Root falsely claimed that Obama was not a student at Columbia University. He later stated in a 2012 interview with Sean Hannity that he believed Obama was a \"foreign exchange student\" there. He has repeatedly described Obama as a \"Marxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, globalist, middle class-hating, Muslim sympathizer\". In 2017, he claimed that Obama was gay, called him \"Bathhouse Barry\" and said that he had info from Obama's \"friends in Chicago\" about his \"sordid past\".

But its leader, \u201cHis Serene Highness\u201d Prince Don Rafael And\u00fajar y Vilches, was born in Spain in 1946 and only established the knightly order that Root belongs to in 2012.\n\nRoot\u2019s journey into the chivalric annals culminated in June, when he attended his knighting ceremony at The Venetian resort and casino in Las Vegas. Dubbed \u201cThe Royal Knighting Investiture,\u201d the gala featured a roughly minute-long ceremony in which And\u00fajar y Vilches knighted Root, who was dressed in a cape and clutching a sword.\n\nIt was apparently a powerful honor for Root, a brash talk radio host who claims to come from origins so humble that he\u2019s an \u201cSOB\u201d\u2014a \u201dSon of a Butcher.\u201d\n\nAfter the event, talk radio industry publication Talkers claimed that Root \u201cis now a Knight in the Royal Order of Constantine the Great & St. Helen and can forever claim the title \u2018Sir Wayne Allyn Root.\u2019\u201d\n\nRoot was excited, to put it mildly.\n\n\u201cThe Root, the Root, the Root is on fire!\u201d Root said on his podcast the day after the ceremony.\n\nIn 2019, Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported that an honor from the Royal House of Capadocia costs between $1,000 and $2,000. But Root insists his \u201cknighthood\u201d wasn\u2019t contingent on any money changing hands.\n\n\u201cI did not pay to be knighted,\u201d Root wrote in an email to The Daily Beast. \u201cZERO.\u201d\n\nInstead, Root claims he was knighted to celebrate his business achievements.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to buy your way into the Cappadocian knightly order, a Cappadocia representative who introduced himself as Duke Gerhart Walch wrote in an email to The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThe Knight or Damehood is bestowed for MERIT and cannot be purchased from the Royal House at any price,\u201d Gerhart told The Daily Beast.\n\nWith that said, according to Gerhart, there certainly is money involved in many of the knighthood events. A website for the gala where Root was knighted lists tickets to the \u201cRoyal Knighting Investiture\u201d as costing $1,000 per person. Gerhart said would-be knights and dames are \u201cencouraged\u201d to make donations to the group\u2019s nonprofit and \u201cpurchase a table to invite his family and friends.\u201d\n\nThere are other costs to be covered, too, according to Gerhart, including the \u201cexpense of the event,\u201d the new knight\u2019s sword, and \u201cjewels.\u201d\n\nEven if Root\u2019s path into chivalry isn\u2019t exactly what his listeners might think of when they imagine a knight, it\u2019s more harmless than some of his other claims. In 2020, for example, New York\u2019s attorney general sent Root a cease-and-desist warning to stop falsely marketing products as coronavirus cures."}, {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/overwhelm-the-system/", "page_content": "Conservative political commentator Wayne Allyn Root opined back in 2010 that President Obama \"is purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy to create systemic failure, economic crisis and social chaos.\"\n\nClaim: Wayne Allyn Root wrote in an opinion piece that President Obama is \"purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy.\"\n\nCORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED\n\nExample: [Root, June 2010]\n\nRahm Emanuel cynically said, \"You never want a crisis to go to waste.\" It is now becoming clear that the crisis he was referring to is Barack Obama's presidency.

He penned a biweekly political opinion column published the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and his entry for 6 June 2010 was the article excerpted above, entitled \"Obama's agenda: Overwhelm the system,\" in which he opined that President Obama is \"purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy to create systemic failure, economic crisis and social chaos.\"\n\nSome online-circulated versions of this column are entitled \"Obama's college roommate speaks out,\" but that heading reflects a misreading of the word \"classmate,\" as Wayne Allyn Root never was, or claimed to be, Barack Obama's roommate \u2014 Root merely attended Columbia University at the same time as Barack Obama did and later claimed (despite substantial evidence to the contrary) that neither he nor anyone else attending Columbia during that time had ever heard of or met Barack Obama.\n\nRoot's credentials as a political prognosticator are rather suspect, as he predicted in May 2012 that Barack Obama would lose the upcoming presidential election to Republican candidate Mitt Romney \"in a landslide.\" (Obama handily won with 62% of the electoral vote.)"}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/Wayne-Allyn-Root", "page_content": "Root has stated that he is exploring a run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2016.\n\nAt the 2008 Libertarian National Convention , Root was eliminated on the fifth ballot in a bid for the party's presidential nomination. He subsequently became the 2008 LP vice presidential candidate alongside Libertarian nominee Bob Barr . In 2010, Root was elected to the Libertarian National Committee (LNC) and re-elected in 2012. He resigned from that position later that year to rejoin the Republican Party . He was later named as Executive Vice Chairman of The Conservative Caucus (TCC) in Washington D.C.\n\nRoot's political columns appear on various conservative web sites, including FoxNews.com, TheBlaze.com, HumanEvents .com, Townhall .com, Breitbart.com, Dailycaller.com, PersonalLiberty.com, Newsmax .com, as well as The Washington Times and Las Vegas Review Journal .\n\nWayne Allyn Root (born July 20, 1961) is an American businessman, politician, television and radio personality, author, television producer, and political commentator. He was the 2008 Libertarian Party (LP) vice-presidential nominee. Root is a former CNBC host and anchorman, and a columnist and commentator for FoxNews.com. Root is a frequent guest on several nationally syndicated radio shows such as Savage Nation , The Jerry Doyle Show , and Mancow's Morning Madhouse . He makes frequent appearances on various programs on the Fox News Channel, and is a frequent speaker at Tea Party events across the United States.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRoot was born in Mount Vernon, New York in 1961, the son of the late David and Stella Root. His father was a butcher from Bronxville, New York, who dabbled in third party politics as one of the original founders of the New York State Conservative Party.\n\nRoot graduated as Valedictorian from his high school, Thornton-Donovan School, then graduated from Columbia University in 1983 as a Political Science major. This would place him in the same graduating class as President Barack Obama. Root has stated that he has no recollection of having met or seen Obama at Columbia.\n\nSports handicapper\n\nRoot's TV handicapping career began in New York City on WNBC radio (now WFAN) in the early 1980s. He moved onto NBC \"Source Radio Network\" syndicated around the country in over 100 markets as a sports talk host. He later became one of the youngest anchormen and national TV hosts in America from 1989 through the early 1990s on Financial News Network (FNN), now known as CNBC.\n\nTV producer and personality\n\nRoot is Founder and Chairman of Winning Edge International Inc. In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.\n\nRoot was the creator, executive producer and co-host (along with HBO's Max Kellerman) of King of Vegas on Spike TV. He is a producer of Ghost Adventures on Travel Channel.\n\nAuthor\n\nRoot is the author of several non-fiction books, including The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide and The Murder of the Middle Class. Other books include The Zen of Gambling,The Joy of Failure!, The King of Vegas' Guide to Gambling, Millionaire Republican, and The Conscience of a Libertarian: Empowering the Citizen Revolution with God, Guns, Gold & Tax Cuts. Root's latest book, released in 2015, is The Power of Relentless: 7 Secrets to Achieving Mega-Success, Financial Freedom and the Life of Your Dreams.\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party. He wrote a book on his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, which was published in 2009.\n\nIn September 2012, Root left the LP and announced his return to major party politics.\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination on Las Vegas' Fox 5 television station. On February 5, 2008, he placed second in the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary with 18% of the vote (47% voted for \"Uncommitted\"). He came in second in Arizona and third in California, without campaigning in any of these states.\n\nOn May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the LP presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who went on to the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the LP vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.\n\nLibertarian National Committee\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party of the United States. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228\u2013281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member.\n\nIn July 2011 Root was elected chair of the \"Libertarian National Congressional Committee\", a Federal Elections Commission registered entity. He renamed it the \"Libertarian National Campaign Committee.\"\n\nAt the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the \"top-down faction.\" The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.\n\nIn a September 2012 letter, he resigned all Libertarian Party positions, saying he would seek a Senate seat \"outside of a third party.\"\n\nReturn to Republican Party in 2012\n\nIn September 2012, Root re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".\n\nFollowing Romney's defeat in the election, Root commented in a Fox News editorial: \"Well, I was wrong. The 2012 electorate looked almost identical to 2008. Obama's supporters didn\u2019t just come for a second helping of misery\u2014they came out enthusiastically and even appeared to cheer for more.\"\n\nPotential 2016 U.S. Senate campaign\n\nRoot has announced that he intends to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Nevada, the seat currently held by Democratic Senator Harry Reid.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nRoot supports smaller government, reduced spending, reduced entitlements, reduced bureaucracy, dramatically lower taxes, and greater personal freedom for all individuals. In the area of education, he supports more parental control, more emphasis on school choice (moving education to the state and local level), and increased competition through vouchers. Root and his wife choose to home-school their children. He is also a strong supporter of gun rights for the individual. Root is a small businessman who believes the 2-party system is built on corruption, greed and bribery. He is a fiscal conservative. He believes most social issues should be determined at the state and local level. Root calls for the repeal of the income tax and favors replacing it, as well as all other sources of federal tax revenues, with a tax on each state in proportion to its population, with each state deciding for itself how to raise its share of the money, as is mentioned in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDuring the Ebola epidemic, Root said that President Obama must be impeached \"before he kills us all\" with terrorists who have the Ebola virus. Root also makes extreme voter fraud allegations, saying President Obama only won reelection because \u201cDemocratic voters across this country are voting four times, five times, 10 times each for the Democrats.\u201d Root wrote a column that said Obama was using the Ferguson protests as part of \"his plan to destroy this country.\"\n\nIn another published commentary, Root speculated that President Obama attended Columbia University as a foreign exchange student, citing his \"gut instinct\" as evidence, and that President Obama was indoctrinated into Marxism while attending Columbia. Root was specifically referring to the fact that Obama's childhood years spent with his mother in Indonesia. In response to Senator Harry Reid's speculation about Mitt Romney's tax returns, Root offered speculation on Obama's college records.\n\nAfter being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, Root wrote a column in May 2015 calling the audit \"a political conspiracy coordinated by leading Democrats to either destroy me, bankrupt me, or silence me.\"\n\nRoot's appeared on The Daily Show program in 2013, where he accused the IRS of profiling him for his political beliefs while he simultaneously spoke in favor of profiling certain racial, ethnic, and religious groups; Root later complained that The Daily Show \"literally committed fraud\" with selective editing.\n\nRoot's theories involving Hillary Clinton include his speculation that Clinton is blackmailing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid prosecution and that Clinton was conspiring with the ACORN organization to steal the 2016 presidential election, even though ACORN no longer existed at that time.\n\nIn a Twitter post reacting to the Supreme Court's upholding of Obamacare, Root said he believed that Chief Justice John Roberts is also being \"blackmailed or intimidated,\" which he added is \"like John Boehner\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nRoot resides in Henderson, Nevada with his wife Debra. The couple has four children."}, {"url": "https://republican.scaclub.org/node/18", "page_content": "Media across the globe calls Wayne Allyn Root \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist.\u201d Wayne is a former Presidential candidate, the 2008 Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, a Libertarian-conservative speaker, political personality and national media superstar.

I\u2019m opening speaker 4 President of United States,\u201d Wayne Allyn Root, a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist and former Libertarian Party vice-presidential nominee, boasted Thursday morning on Twitter, hours before President Trump headlines a Las Vegas rally to elect a Republican ticket in the state.\n\n\u201c@realDonaldTrump personally requested Wayne Root as opening speaker to welcome crowd,\u201d the right-wing commentator claimed. \u201cThank u Mr. President.\u201d\n\nThe opening act makes sense considering Root\u2019s long-running, often sycophantic friendship with the president.\n\nTrump wrote a glowing blurb for Root\u2019s 2015 book Angry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America (which, coincidentally, featured a foreword by shady ex-Trump confidant Roger Stone). Root, in turn, emceed the future president\u2019s 2015 campaign rally in Vegas, and later offered to become Trump\u2019s own \u201cKarl Rove\u201d should he win the election. Earlier this year, Root bragged about spending a \u201cmagical evening\u201d with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAnd in many ways, Root is the Las Vegas version of Trump: He\u2019s a ruthless self-promoter from New York; a heavily airbrushed and often-gaudy TV personality whose flashy antics and love of chintz have made him synonymous with a city.\n\nMoreover, just like the president, Root is now a bombastic right-wing media personality obsessed with the Clintons, Obama, the physical appearance of liberals, and the batshit conspiracy theories that comport with his worldview.\n\nPerhaps most infamously, when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire and killed 58 people at a country-music festival on the Vegas strip last fall, Root proclaimed on Twitter, without a shred of evidence: \u201cThis is real thing. Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack. PRAY for our Vegas police. PRAY for victims. VERY bad. Awful.\u201d\n\nAfter sustained outcry over falsely linking a deadly mass shooting to Islamic terror, Root refused to apologize or back down, instead claiming he heard about the connection from \u201ccredible news sources,\u201d which, at that time, meant far-right conspiratorial websites like The Gateway Pundit. \u201cI report it as I hear it,\u201d Root added.\n\nDays later, on his radio show, Root went off the rails, once again claiming \u201cISIS fingerprints were all over this thing,\u201d before bashing the critics of his radical conspiracy-mongering: \u201cI have nothing to worry about so I laugh in their liberal commie faces, their liberal commie Muslim-sympathizer faces. Screw you! Come and get me. Screw you.\u201d\n\nMonths earlier, after it was revealed that a white nationalist allegedly murdered a female anti-racism protester during the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Root shared a particularly deranged theory: \u201cSuch B.S,\u201d he said of the alleged killer\u2019s far-right politics. \u201cProbably paid actors & infiltrators hired by Soros. No conservative I\u2019ve ever met commits violence. EVER.\u201d\n\nBeyond waxing crazy about deadly news events, Root has also been a leading voice for the right-wing conspiracy theory that Democratic officials ordered the murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich for allegedly passing stolen emails to WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cHe was murdered because he was the guy that gave all the DNC files to Julian Assange and Wikileaks,\u201d Root asserted on his radio show in June 2018, as Right Wing Watch first reported. \u201cThey just killed him for no reason and nobody seems to be interested in finding the killer. And it sure seems to me to point to leading Democrats\u2014Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC, the Clintons, Hillary Clinton, all the above, Donna Brazile, all the above, seem to be mixed up in this, they all had a motive to kill this guy.\u201d\n\nAt other points, he has suggested that Rich\u2019s murderer was former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, former President Bill Clinton, or Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nIn one particularly bizarre tweet, Root wrote: \u201cI think Seth Rich murder is HUGE issue,\u201d boasting in strikingly Trumpian language that \u201cI understand people and psychology. Something is VERY wrong.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Root was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s crusade to prove true the completely debunked conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States. \u201cGood job Donald Trump,\u201d Root tweeted in 2011, long before the birther-in-chief became commander-in-chief. \u201cI can produce my birth certificate in 1 minute. I have it in my safe.\u201d\n\nThe Vegas stalwart would later go on to claim he never was a birther, but simply someone who believed Obama hid dark secrets hidden beneath mundane documents like his college transcripts. Seemingly missing the connotative connection to birtherism, Root once told Hannity that he believes Obama was a \u201cforeign exchange student\u201d at Columbia University.\n\nHe has certainly never shied away from other racially tinged attacks on the first black U.S. president. Obama was a \u201cMarxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, globalist, middle class-hating, Muslim sympathizer,\u201d Root has repeatedly written. At one point, Root called Obama the \u201cfirst Muslim president\u201d in a column that sought to reveal the ex-president\u2018s \u201ctrue religious loyalties.\u201d\n\nThroughout Obama\u2019s eight years in office, Root claimed he was a \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d who was sent\u2014possibly by the Bilderberg Group\u2014to \u201cdestroy this country\u201d from within and \u201ckill all of us.\u201d He further maintained that Obama was gay, referring to him as \u201cBathhouse Barry\u201d and claiming that his \u201cfriends in Chicago\u201d told him the president had a \u201csordid past.\u201d\n\nWhile opening a 2016 Trump rally in Vegas, Root reportedly received rapturous applause by suggesting Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin will meet the same deadly fate as two popular film characters who drove off a cliff. \u201cWe all get our wish,\" Root said of the Clinton-Abedin relationship. \u201cThe ending is like Thelma and Louise.\u201d\n\nBeyond the usual bevy of far-right conspiracy theories and inflammatory rhetoric, Root has seemingly fixated on the sexuality and physical appearances of his liberal enemies.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Root posited earlier this year, because he has \u201cpenis envy.\u201d The radio host declared: \u201cMueller\u2019s is smaller than Trump\u2019s.\u201d According to Right Wing Watch, Root has claimed that \u201call liberal men are gay\u201d and \u201call liberal women are ugly.\u201d\n\nHe has lamented how HBO host John Oliver married a \u201cSTUNNING. GORGEOUS\u2026 Trophy Wife\u201d instead of \u201cplain liberal women.\u201d And he has suggested that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough only became critical of Trump so he could have \u201csex w/hot blonde\u201d Mika Brzezinski, his fianc\u00e9e and co-host.\n\nDuring one bonkers radio segment, Root expressed dismay that some of his social-media critics have referred to him as an old man. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference in when you call someone \u2018old\u2019 versus when you call someone the \u2018N-word,\u2019\u201d the radio-host claimed. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference. It\u2019s a lack of respect. It\u2019s filthy. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nIn a normal world, Root\u2019s level of unabashed buffoonery would put him more at home with the QAnon-flag and Seth Rich poster-toting weirdos that will flock to the Las Vegas Convention Center on Thursday night. But instead he\u2019s the speaker a U.S. president reportedly \u201cpersonally requested\u201d to open for him at a nationally televised event."}, {"url": "https://thefamousdata.com/wayne-allyn/", "page_content": "Wayne Allyn Root Biography\n\nWayne Allyn Root is a conspiracy theorist, activist, far-right political commentator, author, and radio host.

He was the 2008 Libertarian Party (LP) vice-presidential nominee. Root is a former CNBC host and anchorman, and a columnist and commentator for FoxNews.com. Root is a frequent guest on several nationally syndicated radio shows such as Savage Nation, The Jerry Doyle Show, and Mancow's Morning Madhouse. He makes frequent appearances on various programs on the Fox News Channel, and is a frequent speaker at Tea Party events across the United States.[3]\n\nAt the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, Root was eliminated on the fifth ballot in a bid for the party's presidential nomination. He subsequently became the 2008 LP vice presidential candidate alongside Libertarian nominee Bob Barr. In 2010, Root was elected to the Libertarian National Committee (LNC) and re-elected in 2012. He resigned from that position later that year to rejoin the Republican Party. He was later named as Executive Vice Chairman of The Conservative Caucus (TCC) in Washington D.C. Root stated that he was exploring a run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2016, but instead dedicated his efforts to supporting the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. He did not rule out later campaigns.\n\nRoot's political columns appear on various conservative web sites, including FoxNews.com, TheBlaze.com, HumanEvents.com, Townhall.com, Breitbart.com, Dailycaller.com, PersonalLiberty.com, as well as The Washington Times.\n\nHis national television show \"The Wayne Allyn Root Show\" is broadcast by Newsmax TV. Root is an opinion columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRoot was born in Mount Vernon, New York in 1961, the son of the late David and Stella Root. His father was a butcher from Bronxville, New York, who dabbled in third party politics as one of the original founders of the New York State Conservative Party.[4]\n\nRoot graduated as Valedictorian from his high school, Thornton-Donovan School, then graduated from Columbia University in 1983 as a Political Science major. This would place him in the same graduating class as President Barack Obama.[5] Root has stated that he has no recollection of having ever met or seen Obama at Columbia.[5][6] He believes that Obama was born in the United States, but pretended to Columbia to be a foreign student to receive some form of student aid. This subterfuge was later allegedly covered up by the university.\n\nCareer\n\nSports handicapper\n\nRoot's TV handicapping career began in New York City on WNBC radio (now WFAN) in the early 1980s. He moved onto NBC \"Source Radio Network\" syndicated around the country in over 100 markets as a sports talk host. He later became one of the youngest anchormen and national TV hosts in America from 1989 through the early 1990s on Financial News Network (FNN), now known as CNBC. In 2018 he launched a new sports betting information website.[7]\n\nTV producer and personality\n\nRoot is Founder and Chairman of Winning Edge International Inc.[8] In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.\n\nRoot was the creator, executive producer and co-host (along with HBO's Max Kellerman) of King of Vegas on Spike TV. He is a producer of Ghost Adventures on Travel Channel.[9]\n\nAuthor\n\nRoot is the author of several non-fiction books, including The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide and The Murder of the Middle Class. Other books include The Zen of Gambling,The Joy of Failure!, The King of Vegas' Guide to Gambling, Millionaire Republican, and The Conscience of a Libertarian: Empowering the Citizen Revolution with God, Guns, Gold & Tax Cuts. Root's latest book, released in 2015, is The Power of Relentless: 7 Secrets to Achieving Mega-Success, Financial Freedom and the Life of Your Dreams.\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party.[10] He wrote a book on his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, which was published in 2009.[10]\n\nIn September 2012, Root left the LP and announced his return to major party politics.[11][12]\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination on Las Vegas' Fox 5 television station.[13] On February 5, 2008, he placed second in the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary with 18% of the vote (47% voted for \"Uncommitted\"). He came in second in Arizona and third in California, without campaigning in any of these states.[4]\n\nOn May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the LP presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who went on to the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the LP vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.[14]\n\nLibertarian National Committee\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party of the United States. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228\u2013281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member.[15]\n\nIn July 2011 Root was elected chair of the \"Libertarian National Congressional Committee\", a Federal Elections Commission registered entity.[16][17] He renamed it the \"Libertarian National Campaign Committee.\"[18]\n\nAt the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the \"top-down faction.\"[19] The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.[20]\n\nIn a September 2012 letter, he resigned all Libertarian Party positions, saying he would seek a Senate seat \"outside of a third party.\"[11][12]\n\nReturn to Republican Party in 2012\n\nIn September 2012, Root re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.[21][12] He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".[22]\n\nFollowing Romney's defeat in the election,[23] Root commented in a Fox News editorial: \"Well, I was wrong. The 2012 electorate looked almost identical to 2008. Obama's supporters didn\u2019t just come for a second helping of misery\u2014they came out enthusiastically and even appeared to cheer for more.\"[24]\n\nU.S. Senate campaign efforts and beyond\n\nRoot announced that he intended to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Nevada, the seat that was held by Democratic Senator Harry Reid.[12] However, in the end he did not run.\n\nHe supported Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[25]\n\nRoot was opening speaker for Donald Trump's kick-off rally in Las Vegas during the 2016 presidential campaign. At the rally, Root strongly criticized the planned social and economic policies of Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, comparing them to the suicidal outcome of \"Thelma and Louise\".[26] Root continued to support Trump in office.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nRoot supports smaller government, reduced spending, reduced entitlements, reduced bureaucracy, dramatically lower taxes, and greater personal freedom for all individuals. In the area of education, he supports more parental control, more emphasis on school choice (moving education to the state and local level), and increased competition through vouchers. Root and his wife choose to home-school their children. He is also a strong supporter of gun rights for the individual. Root is a small businessman who believes the 2-party system is built on corruption, greed and bribery. He is a fiscal conservative. He believes most social issues should be determined at the state and local level.[4] Root calls for the repeal of the income tax and favors replacing it, as well as all other sources of federal tax revenues, with a tax on each state in proportion to its population, with each state deciding for itself how to raise its share of the money,[27] as is mentioned in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDuring the Ebola epidemic, Root said that President Obama must be impeached \"before he kills us all\" with terrorists who have the Ebola virus.[28][29] Root also makes extreme voter fraud allegations, saying President Obama only won reelection because \u201cDemocratic voters across this country are voting four times, five times, 10 times each for the Democrats.\u201d[30] Root wrote a column that said Obama was using the Ferguson protests as part of \"his plan to destroy this country.\"[31]\n\nIn another published commentary, Root speculated that President Obama attended Columbia University as a foreign exchange student, citing his \"gut instinct\" as evidence, and that President Obama was indoctrinated into Marxism while attending Columbia. Root was specifically referring to the fact that Obama's childhood years spent with his mother in Indonesia. In response to Senator Harry Reid's speculation about Mitt Romney's tax returns, Root offered speculation on Obama's college records.[32][33][34]\n\nAfter being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, Root wrote a column in May 2015 calling the audit \"a political conspiracy coordinated by leading Democrats to either destroy me, bankrupt me, or silence me.\"[35]\n\nRoot appeared on The Daily Show program in 2013, where he accused the IRS of profiling him for his political beliefs while he simultaneously spoke in favor of profiling certain racial, ethnic, and religious groups; Root later complained that The Daily Show \"literally committed fraud\" with selective editing.[36][37]\n\nRoot's theories involving Hillary Clinton include his speculation that Clinton is blackmailing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid prosecution and that Clinton was conspiring with the ACORN organization to steal the 2016 presidential election, even though ACORN no longer existed at that time.[38][39]\n\nIn a Twitter post reacting to the Supreme Court's upholding of Obamacare, Root said he believed that Chief Justice John Roberts is also being \"blackmailed or intimidated,\" which he added is \"like John Boehner\"[40][41]\n\nPersonal life\n\nRoot resides in Henderson, Nevada with his wife Debra. The couple has four children. He is distantly related to advertising pioneer Dave Berg.[42][43]\n\nBibliography\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nAngry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America - and What We Can All Do to Save the Middle Class. 2017.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/wayne-allyn-root/", "page_content": "Wayne Allyn Root (born July 20, 1961) is a conservative American author, radio host, and conspiracy theorist.

At the rally, Root, suggested that he wished ill upon Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, hoping they met the same ending as Thelma & Louise. The lead characters in the film take their own lives by driving off a cliff. In his speech, Root said \"Trump warriors\" armed with \"pitchforks, jack hammers and blow torches\" would violently take over Washington D.C.: \"We're coming to tear it down. We're coming to rip it up. We're coming to kick your ass. And we're coming to put you in prison\", he said referring to a fantasy he had about Clinton and Abedin. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, later told CNN that Root's \"conduct is completely unacceptable and does not reflect our campaign or our candidate\".\n\nIn August 2019, Root praised President Trump. Following Trump's assertion that Jews voting for the Democrats show \"either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\", a comment which was rejected by his critics who said he was following an antisemitic canard, Root countered the claim. Root said that \"Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world...and the Jewish people in Israel love him like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God.\" Later, President Donald Trump thanked Root on Twitter for \"the very nice words\" and shared what was said about him.\n\nIn October 2019, while speaking at a pro-Trump conference in Miami, Florida at the Trump National Doral Miami, Root reportedly boasted about a time in his childhood when, as one of the few white students at a predominantly black high school, he knocked one classmate unconscious and shattered another kid's teeth. \"My buddies and I were high-fiving and laughing,\" Root reportedly said during his speech. \"Man, it was funny.\" He reportedly went on to say that \"you've got to be a natural-born killer\" to win in politics.\n\nPromotion of conspiracy theories and falsehoods\n\nRoot is known for spreading conspiracy theories and false information.\n\nRoot was a leading proponent of the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Root falsely claimed that Obama was not a student at Columbia University. He later stated in a 2012 interview with Sean Hannity that he believed Obama was a \"foreign exchange student\" there.

In 2017, he claimed that Obama was gay, called him \"Bathhouse Barry\" and said that he had info from Obama's \"friends in Chicago\" about his \"sordid past\". In 2014, he described Obama as a \"Manchurian candidate\", possibly hired by the Bilderberg Group to destroy the United States and \"kill all of us\".\n\nHe promoted conspiracy theories around the murder of Seth Rich, and at various times suggested that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Hillary Clinton, Donna Brazile, Bill Clinton, Eric Schneiderman and John Podesta were involved in the murder.\n\nDuring the white supremacist Unite the Right rally, Root falsely claimed that blaming white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. for killing Heather Heyer was \"such B.S.

He was the 2008 Libertarian Party vice-presidential nominee. In June 2009 Richard Winger wrote he was the front runner for the 2012 Libertarian Presidential nomination. Root began his career as a professional sports handicapper, based in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nHis political talk radio show,W.A.R: The Wayne Allyn Root Showis broadcast in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago. Root is a frequent guest on several nationally syndicated radio shows such as Savage Nation, The Jerry Doyle Show, and Mancow's Morning Madhouse. He has also made numerous appearances on various programs on the Fox News Channel. He is a frequent speaker at Tea Party events across the United States.\n\nRoot's political columns appear in the Las Vegas Review Journal and at Newsmax.com.\n\nAt the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, Root was eliminated on the fifth ballot in a bid for the presidential nomination, and subsequently became the vice presidential candidate alongside Libertarian nominee Bob Barr. Root lost a bid to become National Chair of the Libertarian Party at the party's 2010 Convention.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRoot was born in Mount Vernon, New York, the son of the late David and Stella Root. His father was a butcher from Bronxville, New York, who dabbled in third party politics as one of the original founders of the New York State Conservative Party.\n\nRoot graduated as Valedictorian from his high school, Thornton-Donovan School, then graduated from Columbia University in 1983 as a Political Science major (in the same class as President Barack Obama).\n\nPersonal life\n\nHe has been married to Debra Root for over 17 years. The couple have four children: Dakota, Hudson, Remington, and Contessa.\n\nCareer\n\nSports handicapper\n\nRoot's TV handicapping career began in New York City on WNBC radio (now WFAN) in the early 1980s. He moved onto NBC \"Source Radio Network\" syndicated around the country in over 100 markets as a sports talk host. He later became one of the youngest anchormen and national TV hosts in America from 1989 through the early 1990s on Financial News Network (FNN), now known as CNBC.\n\nTV producer and personality\n\nRoot is Founder and Chairman of Winning Edge International Inc. In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.\n\nRoot was the creator, executive producer and co-host (along with HBO's Max Kellerman) of King of Vegas on Spike TV.\n\nAuthor\n\nRoot is the author of several books, including The Zen of Gambling,The Joy of Failure!, The King of Vegas' Guide to Gambling, Millionaire Republican, and The Conscience of a Libertarian: Empowering the Citizen Revolution with God, Guns, Gambling & Tax Cuts.\n\nFinancial adviser\n\nRoot is spokesman, board member and Senior Economic Adviser to Wealth Masters International (\"WMI\"), a global financial services and education company based in Houston, Texas. Norwegian authorities have suspended WMI's sales, finding it to be an illegal pyramid scheme. Root is named in the finding. Root has partnered with Kip Herriage of WMI and Gerald Celente to create the \"Crashproof Prosperity Investment Newsletter\".\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot was a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party. He authored a book on his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, which was published in 2009.\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination on Las Vegas' Fox 5 television station.\n\nOn February 5, 2008, he placed second in the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary with 18% of the vote (47% voted for \"Uncommitted\"). He came in second in Arizona and third in California, without campaigning in any of these states.\n\n2008 vice-presidential candidacy\n\nOn May 25, 2008, Root made it to the fifth ballot of the LP presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who went on to the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the LP vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.\n\nIn September 2008, Root offered to give up his VP slate on the Libertarian ticket to make room for Ron Paul, as the LP had received feelers that the former Republican presidential candidate may have been interested in getting on a strong third party ticket, as there remained a strong following behind him. Paul declined the offer, and denied any intention of running on a third-party presidential ticket.\n\nLibertarian Party National Chair candidacy\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of Libertarian Party National Chair. His candidacy was endorsed by his running mate on the 2008 Libertarian presidential ticket, Bob Barr, and by the Party's first presidential nominee, John Hospers. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228-281 in the third round but subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member. In July 2011 Root was elected chair of the Libertarian National Congressional Committee.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nRoot supports smaller government, reduced spending, reduced entitlements, reduced bureaucracy, dramatically lower taxes, and greater personal freedom for individuals. In the area of education, he supports more parental control, more emphasis on school choice (moving education to the state and local level), and increased competition through vouchers. Root and his wife choose to home-school their children. He is also a strong supporter of gun rights for the individual. Root is a small businessman who believes the 2-party system is built on corruption, greed and bribery. He is a fiscal conservative in the mode of his heroes Ronald Reagan, and Barry Goldwater. He believes most social issues should be determined on the state and local level. Root calls for the repeal of the income tax and favors replacing it, as well as all other sources of federal tax revenues, with a tax on each state in proportion to its population, with each state deciding for itself how to raise its share of the money , which is mentioned in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution. This has been called a \"State-Rate Tax\".\n\nRoot holds that \"the Iraq war is a disaster\". He states the answer is to \"use the success of the surge to declare victory and make plans to get out of Iraq as soon as reasonably possible\". He also questions Central Intelligence Agency information on Iran, would use \"any diplomatic means\", including the United Nations, in order to \"avoid another war\".\n\nBibliography\n\nSee also\n\nBob Barr presidential campaign, 2008\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal links\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Wayne_Allyn_Root", "page_content": "Wayne with his daughter Dakota (left) and now ex-wife Debra (right) in 2008.\n\nThis page contains too many unsourced statements and needs to be improved.

He was again elected as an at-large member in 2012, earning the support of the party's presidential nominee, Gary Johnson.\n\nRoot resigned from all of his positions within the Libertarian Party in September 2012 and returned to the Republican Party.

I\u2019m opening speaker 4 President of United States,\u201d Wayne Allyn Root, a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist and former Libertarian Party vice-presidential nominee, boasted Thursday morning on Twitter, hours before President Trump headlines a Las Vegas rally to elect a Republican ticket in the state.\n\n\u201c@realDonaldTrump personally requested Wayne Root as opening speaker to welcome crowd,\u201d the right-wing commentator claimed. \u201cThank u Mr. President.\u201d\n\nThe opening act makes sense considering Root\u2019s long-running, often sycophantic friendship with the president.\n\nTrump wrote a glowing blurb for Root\u2019s 2015 book Angry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America (which, coincidentally, featured a foreword by shady ex-Trump confidant Roger Stone). Root, in turn, emceed the future president\u2019s 2015 campaign rally in Vegas, and later offered to become Trump\u2019s own \u201cKarl Rove\u201d should he win the election. Earlier this year, Root bragged about spending a \u201cmagical evening\u201d with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAnd in many ways, Root is the Las Vegas version of Trump: He\u2019s a ruthless self-promoter from New York; a heavily airbrushed and often-gaudy TV personality whose flashy antics and love of chintz have made him synonymous with a city.\n\nMoreover, just like the president, Root is now a bombastic right-wing media personality obsessed with the Clintons, Obama, the physical appearance of liberals, and the batshit conspiracy theories that comport with his worldview.\n\nPerhaps most infamously, when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire and killed 58 people at a country-music festival on the Vegas strip last fall, Root proclaimed on Twitter, without a shred of evidence: \u201cThis is real thing. Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack. PRAY for our Vegas police. PRAY for victims. VERY bad. Awful.\u201d\n\nAfter sustained outcry over falsely linking a deadly mass shooting to Islamic terror, Root refused to apologize or back down, instead claiming he heard about the connection from \u201ccredible news sources,\u201d which, at that time, meant far-right conspiratorial websites like The Gateway Pundit. \u201cI report it as I hear it,\u201d Root added.\n\nDays later, on his radio show, Root went off the rails, once again claiming \u201cISIS fingerprints were all over this thing,\u201d before bashing the critics of his radical conspiracy-mongering: \u201cI have nothing to worry about so I laugh in their liberal commie faces, their liberal commie Muslim-sympathizer faces. Screw you! Come and get me. Screw you.\u201d\n\nMonths earlier, after it was revealed that a white nationalist allegedly murdered a female anti-racism protester during the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Root shared a particularly deranged theory: \u201cSuch B.S,\u201d he said of the alleged killer\u2019s far-right politics. \u201cProbably paid actors & infiltrators hired by Soros. No conservative I\u2019ve ever met commits violence. EVER.\u201d\n\nBeyond waxing crazy about deadly news events, Root has also been a leading voice for the right-wing conspiracy theory that Democratic officials ordered the murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich for allegedly passing stolen emails to WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cHe was murdered because he was the guy that gave all the DNC files to Julian Assange and Wikileaks,\u201d Root asserted on his radio show in June 2018, as Right Wing Watch first reported. \u201cThey just killed him for no reason and nobody seems to be interested in finding the killer. And it sure seems to me to point to leading Democrats\u2014Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC, the Clintons, Hillary Clinton, all the above, Donna Brazile, all the above, seem to be mixed up in this, they all had a motive to kill this guy.\u201d\n\nAt other points, he has suggested that Rich\u2019s murderer was former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, former President Bill Clinton, or Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nIn one particularly bizarre tweet, Root wrote: \u201cI think Seth Rich murder is HUGE issue,\u201d boasting in strikingly Trumpian language that \u201cI understand people and psychology. Something is VERY wrong.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Root was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s crusade to prove true the completely debunked conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States. \u201cGood job Donald Trump,\u201d Root tweeted in 2011, long before the birther-in-chief became commander-in-chief. \u201cI can produce my birth certificate in 1 minute. I have it in my safe.\u201d\n\nThe Vegas stalwart would later go on to claim he never was a birther, but simply someone who believed Obama hid dark secrets hidden beneath mundane documents like his college transcripts. Seemingly missing the connotative connection to birtherism, Root once told Hannity that he believes Obama was a \u201cforeign exchange student\u201d at Columbia University.\n\nHe has certainly never shied away from other racially tinged attacks on the first black U.S. president. Obama was a \u201cMarxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, globalist, middle class-hating, Muslim sympathizer,\u201d Root has repeatedly written. At one point, Root called Obama the \u201cfirst Muslim president\u201d in a column that sought to reveal the ex-president\u2018s \u201ctrue religious loyalties.\u201d\n\nThroughout Obama\u2019s eight years in office, Root claimed he was a \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d who was sent\u2014possibly by the Bilderberg Group\u2014to \u201cdestroy this country\u201d from within and \u201ckill all of us.\u201d He further maintained that Obama was gay, referring to him as \u201cBathhouse Barry\u201d and claiming that his \u201cfriends in Chicago\u201d told him the president had a \u201csordid past.\u201d\n\nWhile opening a 2016 Trump rally in Vegas, Root reportedly received rapturous applause by suggesting Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin will meet the same deadly fate as two popular film characters who drove off a cliff. \u201cWe all get our wish,\" Root said of the Clinton-Abedin relationship. \u201cThe ending is like Thelma and Louise.\u201d\n\nBeyond the usual bevy of far-right conspiracy theories and inflammatory rhetoric, Root has seemingly fixated on the sexuality and physical appearances of his liberal enemies.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Root posited earlier this year, because he has \u201cpenis envy.\u201d The radio host declared: \u201cMueller\u2019s is smaller than Trump\u2019s.\u201d According to Right Wing Watch, Root has claimed that \u201call liberal men are gay\u201d and \u201call liberal women are ugly.\u201d\n\nHe has lamented how HBO host John Oliver married a \u201cSTUNNING. GORGEOUS\u2026 Trophy Wife\u201d instead of \u201cplain liberal women.\u201d And he has suggested that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough only became critical of Trump so he could have \u201csex w/hot blonde\u201d Mika Brzezinski, his fianc\u00e9e and co-host.\n\nDuring one bonkers radio segment, Root expressed dismay that some of his social-media critics have referred to him as an old man. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference in when you call someone \u2018old\u2019 versus when you call someone the \u2018N-word,\u2019\u201d the radio-host claimed. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference. It\u2019s a lack of respect. It\u2019s filthy. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nIn a normal world, Root\u2019s level of unabashed buffoonery would put him more at home with the QAnon-flag and Seth Rich poster-toting weirdos that will flock to the Las Vegas Convention Center on Thursday night. But instead he\u2019s the speaker a U.S. president reportedly \u201cpersonally requested\u201d to open for him at a nationally televised event."}], "Wayne Allyn Root is a radio personality.": [{"url": "https://usaradio.com/shows/the-wayne-allyn-root-show/", "page_content": "Show Description\n\n15\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot is a political and media phenomenon.

He is the host of The Wayne Allyn Root Show on KBET and the USA Radio Network and formerly on Newsmax TV. Root was an opinion columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nRoot was the Vice Presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party in the 2008 presidential election. In 2012, he left the Libertarian Party, rejoined the Republican Party, and endorsed and voted for Mitt Romney.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRoot attended the Thornton-Donovan School in New Rochelle, New York, and was a member of the class of 1983 at Columbia University, studying pre-law and political science.\n\nIn June 2016, Root described himself as a \"Jew turned Evangelical Christian\". As of November 2016, Root described himself as Jewish, and says he considers Donald Trump to be the first Jewish president, in the same sense that Bill Clinton was often called the \"first black president\".\n\nCareer\n\nRoot worked for WNBC radio (now WFAN) in the early 1980s. From 1989 to 1991, he worked with the Financial News Network before its subsumption into CNBC.\n\nRoot was founder and chairman of Winning Edge International Inc. In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.\n\nRoot co-hosted King of Vegas on Spike TV. He produced Ghost Adventures on the Travel Channel.\n\nRoot was a board member of Wealth Masters International (\"WMI\"), a now-defunct global financial services and education company based in Houston, Texas. In 2010 Norwegian authorities suspended WMI's sales, finding it to be an illegal pyramid scheme. Root was named in the finding.\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. He ran for a seat on the Westchester County Board of Legislators in 1983. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party. Root's book outlining his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, was published in 2009.\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination. On May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the Libertarian Party presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who became the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.\n\nThough in the same graduating class as Barack Obama at Columbia University, Root has stated on a number of occasions that he has no recollection of having met or seen Obama at Columbia. He has \"stopped short\" of actually claiming that Obama did not attend Columbia.\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228\u2013281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an at-large member. At the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the \"top-down faction.\" The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.\n\nReturn to the Republican Party\n\nIn September 2012, Root resigned all Libertarian Party positions, re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".\n\nRoot had announced that he intended to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2016, for the seat held by retiring Democratic Senator Harry Reid. However, he did not run. He supported Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRoot was the opening speaker for Trump's rally in Las Vegas in late October 2016 during the presidential campaign. At the rally, Root, suggested that he wished ill upon Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, hoping they met the same ending as Thelma & Louise. The lead characters in the film take their own lives by driving off a cliff. In his speech, Root said \"Trump warriors\" armed with \"pitchforks, jack hammers and blow torches\" would violently take over Washington D.C.: \"We're coming to tear it down. We're coming to rip it up. We're coming to kick your ass. And we're coming to put you in prison\", he said referring to a fantasy he had about Clinton and Abedin. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, later told CNN that Root's \"conduct is completely unacceptable and does not reflect our campaign or our candidate\".\n\nIn August 2019, Root praised President Trump. Following Trump's assertion that Jews voting for the Democrats show \"either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\", a comment which was rejected by his critics who said he was following an antisemitic canard, Root countered the claim. Root said that \"Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world...and the Jewish people in Israel love him like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God.\" Later, President Donald Trump thanked Root on Twitter for \"the very nice words\" and shared what was said about him.\n\nIn October 2019, while speaking at a pro-Trump conference in Miami, Florida at the Trump National Doral Miami, Root reportedly boasted about a time in his childhood when, as one of the few white students at a predominantly black high school, he knocked one classmate unconscious and shattered another kid's teeth. \"My buddies and I were high-fiving and laughing,\" Root reportedly said during his speech. \"Man, it was funny.\" He reportedly went on to say that \"you've got to be a natural-born killer\" to win in politics.\n\nPromotion of conspiracy theories and falsehoods\n\nRoot is known for spreading conspiracy theories and false information.\n\nRoot was a leading proponent of the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Root falsely claimed that Obama was not a student at Columbia University. He later stated in a 2012 interview with Sean Hannity that he believed Obama was a \"foreign exchange student\" there. He has repeatedly described Obama as a \"Marxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, globalist, middle class-hating, Muslim sympathizer\". In 2017, he claimed that Obama was gay, called him \"Bathhouse Barry\" and said that he had info from Obama's \"friends in Chicago\" about his \"sordid past\". In 2014, he described Obama as a \"Manchurian candidate\", possibly hired by the Bilderberg Group to destroy the United States and \"kill all of us\".\n\nHe promoted conspiracy theories around the murder of Seth Rich, and at various times suggested that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Hillary Clinton, Donna Brazile, Bill Clinton, Eric Schneiderman and John Podesta were involved in the murder.\n\nDuring the white supremacist Unite the Right rally, Root falsely claimed that blaming white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. for killing Heather Heyer was \"such B.S. Probably paid actors & infiltrators hired by Soros. No conservative I've ever met commits violence. EVER.\"\n\nOn the night of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, in which 58 people were murdered, Root tweeted: \"Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack.\" Police later determined only one shooter\u2014a non-religious American\u2014was involved.\n\nRoot argued that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is motivated by \"penis envy\", because \"Mueller's is smaller than Trump's.\"\n\nControversies\n\nLegal problems\n\nOn March 19\u201321, 2020, Chief Health Care Bureau Lisa Landau and New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, ordered Root to stop advertising My Doctor Suggests, LLC on KBET and USA Radio Network citing violations of state laws on deceptive acts and practices.\n\nOn April 29, 2020, Gordon Pedersen of My Doctor Suggests LLC and GP Silver LLC was ordered by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Trump administration to permanently stop advertising and selling all of these products out there. A hearing on the government\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction is set for May 12, 2020.\n\nFeud with KDWN co-host Brian Shapiro of The Vegas Take\n\nOn March 20, 2020, Root was fired from the Las Vegas Review-Journal for a second time citing violations of journalistic standards by J. Keith Moyer and for feuding with KDWN co-host Brian Shapiro of The Vegas Take during a morning interview. Root was also fired from Newsmax as Newsmax TV discontinued their simulcast of the show at the same time.\n\nFeud with former Nevada State Treasurer Dan Schwartz\n\nOn April 16, 2020, Root on Facebook and Twitter slammed Dan Schwartz for attacking Daniel Rodimer on a TV ad by permanently banning him on his radio show and accusing him of libel and slander by referring him as persona non grata."}, {"url": "https://rootforamerica.com/", "page_content": "WAR Story\n\nThe Bio of Wayne Allyn Root\n\nWayne Allyn Root has been branded by media across the globe as \u201cthe Capitalist Evangelist.\u201d A former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, Wayne is a fierce, enthusiastic and relentless defender of Reagan conservatism, Libertarianism, economic freedom and capitalism.\n\n\u201cWayne Allyn Root is one of the great conservative thinkers in America\u201d \u2013 Bill Cunningham, host \u201cThe Bill Cunningham Show\u201d Premiere Radio Network\n\nHe is both a political and business personality in the national media.

In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.\n\nRoot was the creator, executive producer and co-host (along with HBO's Max Kellerman) of King of Vegas on Spike TV. He is a producer of Ghost Adventures on Travel Channel.\n\nAuthor\n\nRoot is the author of several non-fiction books, including The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide and The Murder of the Middle Class. Other books include The Zen of Gambling,The Joy of Failure!, The King of Vegas' Guide to Gambling, Millionaire Republican, and The Conscience of a Libertarian: Empowering the Citizen Revolution with God, Guns, Gold & Tax Cuts. Root's latest book, released in 2015, is The Power of Relentless: 7 Secrets to Achieving Mega-Success, Financial Freedom and the Life of Your Dreams.\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party. He wrote a book on his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, which was published in 2009.\n\nIn September 2012, Root left the LP and announced his return to major party politics.\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination on Las Vegas' Fox 5 television station. On February 5, 2008, he placed second in the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary with 18% of the vote (47% voted for \"Uncommitted\"). He came in second in Arizona and third in California, without campaigning in any of these states.\n\nOn May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the LP presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who went on to the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the LP vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.\n\nLibertarian National Committee\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party of the United States. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228\u2013281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member.\n\nIn July 2011 Root was elected chair of the \"Libertarian National Congressional Committee\", a Federal Elections Commission registered entity. He renamed it the \"Libertarian National Campaign Committee.\"\n\nAt the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the \"top-down faction.\" The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.\n\nIn a September 2012 letter, he resigned all Libertarian Party positions, saying he would seek a Senate seat \"outside of a third party.\"\n\nReturn to Republican Party in 2012\n\nIn September 2012, Root re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".\n\nFollowing Romney's defeat in the election, Root commented in a Fox News editorial: \"Well, I was wrong. The 2012 electorate looked almost identical to 2008. Obama's supporters didn\u2019t just come for a second helping of misery\u2014they came out enthusiastically and even appeared to cheer for more.\"\n\nPotential 2016 U.S. Senate campaign\n\nRoot has announced that he intends to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Nevada, the seat currently held by Democratic Senator Harry Reid.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nRoot supports smaller government, reduced spending, reduced entitlements, reduced bureaucracy, dramatically lower taxes, and greater personal freedom for all individuals. In the area of education, he supports more parental control, more emphasis on school choice (moving education to the state and local level), and increased competition through vouchers. Root and his wife choose to home-school their children. He is also a strong supporter of gun rights for the individual. Root is a small businessman who believes the 2-party system is built on corruption, greed and bribery. He is a fiscal conservative. He believes most social issues should be determined at the state and local level. Root calls for the repeal of the income tax and favors replacing it, as well as all other sources of federal tax revenues, with a tax on each state in proportion to its population, with each state deciding for itself how to raise its share of the money, as is mentioned in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDuring the Ebola epidemic, Root said that President Obama must be impeached \"before he kills us all\" with terrorists who have the Ebola virus. Root also makes extreme voter fraud allegations, saying President Obama only won reelection because \u201cDemocratic voters across this country are voting four times, five times, 10 times each for the Democrats.\u201d Root wrote a column that said Obama was using the Ferguson protests as part of \"his plan to destroy this country.\"\n\nIn another published commentary, Root speculated that President Obama attended Columbia University as a foreign exchange student, citing his \"gut instinct\" as evidence, and that President Obama was indoctrinated into Marxism while attending Columbia. Root was specifically referring to the fact that Obama's childhood years spent with his mother in Indonesia. In response to Senator Harry Reid's speculation about Mitt Romney's tax returns, Root offered speculation on Obama's college records.\n\nAfter being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, Root wrote a column in May 2015 calling the audit \"a political conspiracy coordinated by leading Democrats to either destroy me, bankrupt me, or silence me.\"\n\nRoot's appeared on The Daily Show program in 2013, where he accused the IRS of profiling him for his political beliefs while he simultaneously spoke in favor of profiling certain racial, ethnic, and religious groups; Root later complained that The Daily Show \"literally committed fraud\" with selective editing.\n\nRoot's theories involving Hillary Clinton include his speculation that Clinton is blackmailing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid prosecution and that Clinton was conspiring with the ACORN organization to steal the 2016 presidential election, even though ACORN no longer existed at that time.\n\nIn a Twitter post reacting to the Supreme Court's upholding of Obamacare, Root said he believed that Chief Justice John Roberts is also being \"blackmailed or intimidated,\" which he added is \"like John Boehner\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nRoot resides in Henderson, Nevada with his wife Debra. The couple has four children."}], "Wayne Allyn Root is an author.": [{"url": "https://www.westernjournal.com/author/wroot/", "page_content": "Wayne Allyn Root is known as the Conservative Warrior.

He was the 2008 Libertarian Party (LP) vice-presidential nominee. Root is a former CNBC host and anchorman, and a columnist and commentator for FoxNews.com. Root is a frequent guest on several nationally syndicated radio shows such as Savage Nation, The Jerry Doyle Show, and Mancow's Morning Madhouse. He makes frequent appearances on various programs on the Fox News Channel, and is a frequent speaker at Tea Party events across the United States.[3]\n\nAt the 2008 Libertarian National Convention, Root was eliminated on the fifth ballot in a bid for the party's presidential nomination. He subsequently became the 2008 LP vice presidential candidate alongside Libertarian nominee Bob Barr. In 2010, Root was elected to the Libertarian National Committee (LNC) and re-elected in 2012. He resigned from that position later that year to rejoin the Republican Party. He was later named as Executive Vice Chairman of The Conservative Caucus (TCC) in Washington D.C. Root stated that he was exploring a run as a Republican for U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2016, but instead dedicated his efforts to supporting the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. He did not rule out later campaigns.\n\nRoot's political columns appear on various conservative web sites, including FoxNews.com, TheBlaze.com, HumanEvents.com, Townhall.com, Breitbart.com, Dailycaller.com, PersonalLiberty.com, as well as The Washington Times.\n\nHis national television show \"The Wayne Allyn Root Show\" is broadcast by Newsmax TV. Root is an opinion columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRoot was born in Mount Vernon, New York in 1961, the son of the late David and Stella Root. His father was a butcher from Bronxville, New York, who dabbled in third party politics as one of the original founders of the New York State Conservative Party.[4]\n\nRoot graduated as Valedictorian from his high school, Thornton-Donovan School, then graduated from Columbia University in 1983 as a Political Science major. This would place him in the same graduating class as President Barack Obama.[5] Root has stated that he has no recollection of having ever met or seen Obama at Columbia.[5][6] He believes that Obama was born in the United States, but pretended to Columbia to be a foreign student to receive some form of student aid. This subterfuge was later allegedly covered up by the university.\n\nCareer\n\nSports handicapper\n\nRoot's TV handicapping career began in New York City on WNBC radio (now WFAN) in the early 1980s. He moved onto NBC \"Source Radio Network\" syndicated around the country in over 100 markets as a sports talk host. He later became one of the youngest anchormen and national TV hosts in America from 1989 through the early 1990s on Financial News Network (FNN), now known as CNBC. In 2018 he launched a new sports betting information website.[7]\n\nTV producer and personality\n\nRoot is Founder and Chairman of Winning Edge International Inc.[8] In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.\n\nRoot was the creator, executive producer and co-host (along with HBO's Max Kellerman) of King of Vegas on Spike TV. He is a producer of Ghost Adventures on Travel Channel.[9]\n\nAuthor\n\nRoot is the author of several non-fiction books, including The Ultimate Obama Survival Guide and The Murder of the Middle Class. Other books include The Zen of Gambling,The Joy of Failure!, The King of Vegas' Guide to Gambling, Millionaire Republican, and The Conscience of a Libertarian: Empowering the Citizen Revolution with God, Guns, Gold & Tax Cuts. Root's latest book, released in 2015, is The Power of Relentless: 7 Secrets to Achieving Mega-Success, Financial Freedom and the Life of Your Dreams.\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party.[10] He wrote a book on his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, which was published in 2009.[10]\n\nIn September 2012, Root left the LP and announced his return to major party politics.[11][12]\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination on Las Vegas' Fox 5 television station.[13] On February 5, 2008, he placed second in the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary with 18% of the vote (47% voted for \"Uncommitted\"). He came in second in Arizona and third in California, without campaigning in any of these states.[4]\n\nOn May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the LP presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who went on to the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the LP vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.[14]\n\nLibertarian National Committee\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party of the United States. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228\u2013281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member.[15]\n\nIn July 2011 Root was elected chair of the \"Libertarian National Congressional Committee\", a Federal Elections Commission registered entity.[16][17] He renamed it the \"Libertarian National Campaign Committee.\"[18]\n\nAt the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the \"top-down faction.\"[19] The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.[20]\n\nIn a September 2012 letter, he resigned all Libertarian Party positions, saying he would seek a Senate seat \"outside of a third party.\"[11][12]\n\nReturn to Republican Party in 2012\n\nIn September 2012, Root re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election.[21][12] He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".[22]\n\nFollowing Romney's defeat in the election,[23] Root commented in a Fox News editorial: \"Well, I was wrong. The 2012 electorate looked almost identical to 2008. Obama's supporters didn\u2019t just come for a second helping of misery\u2014they came out enthusiastically and even appeared to cheer for more.\"[24]\n\nU.S. Senate campaign efforts and beyond\n\nRoot announced that he intended to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Nevada, the seat that was held by Democratic Senator Harry Reid.[12] However, in the end he did not run.\n\nHe supported Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.[25]\n\nRoot was opening speaker for Donald Trump's kick-off rally in Las Vegas during the 2016 presidential campaign. At the rally, Root strongly criticized the planned social and economic policies of Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, comparing them to the suicidal outcome of \"Thelma and Louise\".[26] Root continued to support Trump in office.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nRoot supports smaller government, reduced spending, reduced entitlements, reduced bureaucracy, dramatically lower taxes, and greater personal freedom for all individuals. In the area of education, he supports more parental control, more emphasis on school choice (moving education to the state and local level), and increased competition through vouchers. Root and his wife choose to home-school their children. He is also a strong supporter of gun rights for the individual. Root is a small businessman who believes the 2-party system is built on corruption, greed and bribery. He is a fiscal conservative. He believes most social issues should be determined at the state and local level.[4] Root calls for the repeal of the income tax and favors replacing it, as well as all other sources of federal tax revenues, with a tax on each state in proportion to its population, with each state deciding for itself how to raise its share of the money,[27] as is mentioned in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDuring the Ebola epidemic, Root said that President Obama must be impeached \"before he kills us all\" with terrorists who have the Ebola virus.[28][29] Root also makes extreme voter fraud allegations, saying President Obama only won reelection because \u201cDemocratic voters across this country are voting four times, five times, 10 times each for the Democrats.\u201d[30] Root wrote a column that said Obama was using the Ferguson protests as part of \"his plan to destroy this country.\"[31]\n\nIn another published commentary, Root speculated that President Obama attended Columbia University as a foreign exchange student, citing his \"gut instinct\" as evidence, and that President Obama was indoctrinated into Marxism while attending Columbia. Root was specifically referring to the fact that Obama's childhood years spent with his mother in Indonesia. In response to Senator Harry Reid's speculation about Mitt Romney's tax returns, Root offered speculation on Obama's college records.[32][33][34]\n\nAfter being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, Root wrote a column in May 2015 calling the audit \"a political conspiracy coordinated by leading Democrats to either destroy me, bankrupt me, or silence me.\"[35]\n\nRoot appeared on The Daily Show program in 2013, where he accused the IRS of profiling him for his political beliefs while he simultaneously spoke in favor of profiling certain racial, ethnic, and religious groups; Root later complained that The Daily Show \"literally committed fraud\" with selective editing.[36][37]\n\nRoot's theories involving Hillary Clinton include his speculation that Clinton is blackmailing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid prosecution and that Clinton was conspiring with the ACORN organization to steal the 2016 presidential election, even though ACORN no longer existed at that time.[38][39]\n\nIn a Twitter post reacting to the Supreme Court's upholding of Obamacare, Root said he believed that Chief Justice John Roberts is also being \"blackmailed or intimidated,\" which he added is \"like John Boehner\"[40][41]\n\nPersonal life\n\nRoot resides in Henderson, Nevada with his wife Debra. The couple has four children. He is distantly related to advertising pioneer Dave Berg.[42][43]\n\nBibliography\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nAngry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America - and What We Can All Do to Save the Middle Class. 2017.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found."}], "Wayne Allyn Root is a political candidate.": [{"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/overwhelm-the-system/", "page_content": "Conservative political commentator Wayne Allyn Root opined back in 2010 that President Obama \"is purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy to create systemic failure, economic crisis and social chaos.\"\n\nClaim: Wayne Allyn Root wrote in an opinion piece that President Obama is \"purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy.\"\n\nCORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED\n\nExample: [Root, June 2010]\n\nRahm Emanuel cynically said, \"You never want a crisis to go to waste.\" It is now becoming clear that the crisis he was referring to is Barack Obama's presidency.

He is purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy to create systemic failure, economic crisis and social chaos \u2014 thereby destroying capitalism and our country from within. Barack Obama is my college classmate (Columbia University, class of '83). As Glenn Beck correctly predicted from day one, Obama is following the plan of Cloward & Piven, two professors at Columbia University. They outlined a plan to socialize America by overwhelming the system with government spending and entitlement demands. Add up the clues below. Taken individually they're alarming. Taken as a whole, it is a brilliant, Machiavellian game plan to turn the United States into a socialist/Marxist state with a permanent majority that desperately needs government for survival ... and can be counted on to always vote for bigger government. Why not? They have no responsibility to pay for it.

He penned a biweekly political opinion column published the Las Vegas Review-Journal, and his entry for 6 June 2010 was the article excerpted above, entitled \"Obama's agenda: Overwhelm the system,\" in which he opined that President Obama is \"purposely overwhelming the U.S. economy to create systemic failure, economic crisis and social chaos.\"\n\nSome online-circulated versions of this column are entitled \"Obama's college roommate speaks out,\" but that heading reflects a misreading of the word \"classmate,\" as Wayne Allyn Root never was, or claimed to be, Barack Obama's roommate \u2014 Root merely attended Columbia University at the same time as Barack Obama did and later claimed (despite substantial evidence to the contrary) that neither he nor anyone else attending Columbia during that time had ever heard of or met Barack Obama.\n\nRoot's credentials as a political prognosticator are rather suspect, as he predicted in May 2012 that Barack Obama would lose the upcoming presidential election to Republican candidate Mitt Romney \"in a landslide.\" (Obama handily won with 62% of the electoral vote.)"}, {"url": "https://www.jta.org/2019/08/21/politics/who-is-wayne-allen-root-the-evangelical-christian-trump-quoted-to-validate-his-comments-on-jews", "page_content": "WASHINGTON (JTA) \u2014 On Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump quoted a conservative talk show host named Wayne Allyn Root to defend comments he had made the day before that angered many in the Jewish community: that Jews who vote for Democrats show \u201ca total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you to Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words,\u201d Trump said before quoting something Root has said previously about the president.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world \u2026 and the Jewish people in Israel love him \u2026 like he\u2019s the King of Israel.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019\n\n\u2026.like he\u2019s the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God\u2026But American Jews don\u2019t know him or like him. They don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that\u2019s OK, if he keeps doing what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s good for\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s not the only Jewish thing Root has said about Trump. Just two weeks after Trump was elected, Root sought to reassure Jewish Americans, who had voted overwhelmingly for his rival, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, about the president-elect\u2019s bona fides.\n\n\u201cI believe Donald Trump should be called \u2018America\u2019s first Jewish president,'\u201d he wrote on the Fox News website. \u201cI should know. I\u2019m an Ivy League-educated Jewish kid from New York.\u201d\n\nMaybe, in the sense that Saul was a Jewish kid from Tarsus \u2014 Root is an evangelical Christian, something he did not mention in his Fox column.\n\nRoot, speaking Tuesday evening on his talk show on Newsmax, also a conservative news site, was a little more candid about where he was faith-wise.\n\n\u201cI happen to be Jewish by birth,\u201d he said.\n\nWho exactly is Wayne Allyn Root and why are he and Trump so fond of each other? Here are some answers.\n\nHe says he\u2019s Jewish and has interesting ideas about Jewish identity.\n\nIn the Fox column, the 58-year-old Root refers to his \u201cJewish butcher father, David Root.\u201d He told The Jewish Telegraphic Agency that all four grandparents are Jewish and that his DNA shows him \u201c99.5\u201d percent European Jewish.\n\nRoot, who lives in Las Vegas, says he founded the Republican Jewish Coalition chapter in Nevada. Matt Brooks, the RJC\u2019s executive director, confirmed that Root was involved in the group but says he has not been for more than a decade. (Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate who is a major funder of the RJC and Republican candidates along with Jewish causes, hired Root to write a column for the Las Vegas Review-Journal after buying the newspaper in 2015 \u2014 a move that raised eyebrows among fans of the paper\u2019s hard news tradition.)\n\nRoot told JTA he \u201ctook Jesus Christ as a savior\u201d about 30 years ago, but he still considers himself Jewish.\n\nNotably, several other Trump defenders are Jews turned Christian, including Trump\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, and the right-wing activist and lawyer Larry Klayman.\n\nThe lessons Root takes away from being born Jewish comport with hoary Jewish stereotypes \u2014 some flattering, others less so.\n\n\u201cI am a Jew and you can\u2019t take away from a person being a Jew,\u201d he said, noting that Islamist extremists and white supremacists would target him as Jewish. \u201cI\u2019ve got Jewish blood and passion and zeal.\u201d\n\n\u201cJesus Christ was a Jew, and the CEO of the Christian religion,\u201d Root said, adding that he, too, was born Jewish and was a CEO.\n\nRoot, who calls himself a \u201ccapitalist evangelist\u201d told Daniel Davis, a syndicated radio host, that his Jewish background informed his philosophy. Jews were \u201crelentless,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey like to hammer down the door till they get what they want,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the Fox column, Root said Trump \u201cis your typical Jewish parent.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald\u2019s children are all Ivy League graduates \u2014 just like my daughter who recently graduated magna cum laude from Harvard,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cDonald is handing his business over to his children. That is the goal of every Jewish businessman in history.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the column: \u201cDonald is a big success in Hollywood as a TV producer. He joins an exclusive club that is predominantly Jewish.\u201d\n\nAdd forthrightness to the list of traits Root finds Jewish.\n\n\u201cHe says whatever is on his mind, even if it offends,\u201d he wrote in the column. \u201cAll of those are traits I\u2019ve seen in my Jewish friends, relatives and business partners for my entire life.\u201d\n\nHe can be emphatically evangelical.\n\nA few months before the 2016 election, writing on another conservative website, Townhall, Root used a more Christian pitch in addressing coreligionists who were put off by Trump\u2019s brashness and viciousness.\n\n\u201cLet me repeat my message to Christians: \u2018YOU\u2019RE MISSING THE BOAT,'\u201d Root said. \u201cGod is about miracles. We don\u2019t need a \u2018nice guy\u2019 or a \u2018gentleman\u2019 right now. It\u2019s the fourth quarter and we\u2019re losing 14-0. We need a miracle. I believe Trump is our miracle.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been on the Trump train longer than most.\n\nRoot, the Libertarian Party\u2019s vice presidential nominee in 2008, announced his support for the businessman and reality star almost as soon as Trump announced he was running in June 2015. He emceed one of the candidate\u2019s first rallies, in Las Vegas. Trump, unsurprisingly, praised Root\u2019s book \u201cAngry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America\u201d published that year.\n\nRoot, who ran a sports gambling business, told JTA that the Republican Party has not done enough to shake Jewish voters out of their adherence to Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one of the best salesmen in America, and I believe I can sell conservatism to Jews,\u201d he said.\n\nRoot went on to say that he would soon announce that he will head a \u201cmajor Jewish organization\u201d and planned to set up a Jews for Trump political action committee.\n\nHe\u2019s called a conspiracy theorist \u2014 he says he asks questions.\n\nLiberal outlets have long singled out Root for peddling conspiracy theories, including that the 2017 shooting massacre in Las Vegas that killed 58 concertgoers was the work of Islamist extremists. No motive has been ascribed for the attack, which was carried out by a white non-Muslim man named Stephen Paddock.\n\nRoot has also questioned whether white supremacists were behind the deadly violence at a neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, and whether there is more to the 2016 murder of Seth Rich, a Jewish Democratic Party staffer. (Police believe Rich was killed in a robbery gone bad; conspiracy theorists believe Hillary Clinton was behind the killing.)\n\nRoot told JTA that conspiracy theories proliferate on the right and the left, and that he does not necessarily endorse the theories \u2014 he asks questions. That, he said, was a very American thing to do, and that pluralities of Americans do not buy into the accepted narratives behind the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in 1963 or the suicide of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein this month.\n\n\u201cI question everything coming out of the mouths of government officials,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re egomaniacs who lie about everything to protect themselves.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.lp.org/news-press-releases-wayne-allyn-root-selected-as-vice-presidential-candidate/", "page_content": "For Immediate Release\n\nLibertarian Party fronts Barr/Root ticket for 2008\n\nDenver \u2013 Wayne Allyn Root was selected on Sunday as the 2008 nominee for vice president at the Libertarian National Convention.

I never thought the day would come when I would have to vote for a third party candidate or a write-in, but here we are. Below is my analysis of the leading Libertarian party candidate for President, Wayne Allyn Root.\n\nAbout the Candidate: Wayne Allyn Root is a business mogul, TV producer, best-selling author, professional sports handicapper, and prospective Libertarian Party presidential candidate based in Las Vegas, Nevada. Root attended Columbia University as a Political Science major (graduating in 1983 in the same class as Barack Obama).\n\nIssue/Voting Criteria Candidate\u2019s Stance Candidate\u2019s Record Grade 1. Strengthening the Family From Root\u2019s website\n\n-\u201cI support Freedom and Parental Choice in the Educational System- We need to give parents and students the freedom to pursue the education of their choice- just as my wife and I do by choosing to home-school our 4 children. I support giving parents control of the education of their own children, instead of government bureaucrats. I support utilization of school choice, vouchers or tax credits on the state and local level to increase education competition.\u201d\n\n-\u201cI support the legalization, regulation & taxation of Online Gaming\u201d\n\n\n\n-Root was the creator, executive producer and co-host of King of Vegas on Spike TV. First airing in January, 2006, King of Vegas was a gambling competition where players competed in a variety of different games to win a million dollars.\n\n-Root has been married to a former Miss Oklahoma, Debra Root, for over 16 years. The couple have four children.\n\n-Root is also the author of several books, including The Zen of Gambling, and \u201cThe King of Vegas\u2019 Guide to Gambling\u201d\n\nFrom Wikipedia and BlackJackHero.com -Root was the creator, executive producer and co-host of King of Vegas on Spike TV.

Pro-Life/Anti-Abortion From Root\u2019s website\n\n\u201cI believe abortion is a matter of personal choice and not intended for federal government intervention. It is a States\u2019 Rights issue. Let\u2019s get the federal government out of a woman\u2019s right to choose what to do with their own body- this will prevent the death of innocent women at the hands of butchers in back-alleys. BUT I also support common sense limitations on abortion.\u201d\n\nD 1B. Pro-Traditional Marriage\n\nFrom Root\u2019s website\n\n-\u201cI support gay rights and civil unions. Gay marriage however is not a federal issue. It is a States\u2019 Rights issue only.\u201d\n\n-Root derides the Republican party for making \u201cthe banning of gay marriage a top priority.\u201d\n\nF 2. Defending Our Country From Root\u2019s website\n\n-\u201cSupport our troops with the best weapons, protective body and vehicle armor.\u201d\n\n-\u201cLet\u2019s keep our military and national defense strong. One way to ensure this is to dramatically reduce foreign aid (especially to our enemies) and foreign military bases across the globe.\u201d\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\n-Although a longtime staunch Republican who had been a big contributor to Republican candidates throughout the country, Root has never held political office. (Therefore he doesn\u2019t have much of a record if any, on the issues to the left.)\n\n-\u201cI\u2019m certainly not the usual Presidential candidate as a small businessman and son of a butcher\u2026 I will govern with common sense, not fancy college degrees. I have no interest in running government, or growing government. My only goal is cutting government. I will lead America back to prosperity by restoring fiscal discipline, personal responsibility, rugged individualism, and individual rights and freedoms. Just as our Founding Fathers intended.\u201d\n\nB 2A. Defeating Terrorists From Root\u2019s website\n\n-\u201cUse the success of the surge to declare victory and make plans to get out of Iraq as soon as reasonably possible.\u201d\n\n-\u201cThe first line of defense against terrorism is the armed American\u201d\n\n-\u201cIt is time to admit that while there is a \u201cwar on terror,\u201d the war in Iraq had (and has) little do with it\u2026It\u2019s time to admit that the war in Iraq has fostered terrorism.\u201d\n\nD 2B. Protecting Our Borders From Root\u2019s website\n\n-\u201cWe must first secure our borders to control the entry into our country of foreigners who pose a threat to the security, health, property or economic well-being of Americans. We must secure our borders before we can deal with the issue of how to deal with illegal immigrants already in our country.\u201d\n\n-\u201cI oppose public funding and entitlements for illegal aliens. But I support providing a \u201cPath to Citizenship\u201d for 12 to 15 million illegal immigrants already here.\u201d\n\nC 3. Free Market Economic Policy TV Interview posted on Root\u2019s website\n\n-\u201cIt\u2019s not greedy to want to keep your own money. It\u2019s greedy to want to take others\u2019 money. Even if you say it is to give to other people, it\u2019s still stealing.\u201d\n\n-\u201cI support a Free Market health care system- Let\u2019s get the federal government out of the health care business and leave it up to individuals.\u201d\n\n-\u201cIt\u2019s not greedy to want to keep your own money.

See above.\n\nA 3A. Lower Taxes From Root\u2019s website\n\n-\u201cI pledge that if elected, my first act is to give the power back to the people. It\u2019s your tax money, it\u2019s your government. I plan to return it to you!\u201d\n\n-\u201cLow taxes and a booming economy that creates unlimited opportunities for upward mobility and wealth. But raise tax rates and the window of opportunity shuts closed on millions of ambitious, courageous, entrepreneurial risk-takers.\u201d\n\nA 3B. Smaller Government From Root\u2019s website\n\n-\u201cI support restoring the constitution, getting the federal government out of our lives, and solving problems at the most local level possible.\u201d\n\n-\u201cI support cutting, shrinking and/or streamlining entire departments of the federal government- departments that based on the Constitution are not under federal jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nA\n\nAfter reading Root\u2019s position on fiscal issues, I thought I might have a viable alternative to the Republican party, where I have traditionally voted. But Root\u2019s position on social issues, such as strengthening the family (or lack thereof), ruined his chances with me. Roots position on national defense was also weaker than I would like to see. Overall, he earns a 2.33 grade point average. Surprisingly, this is a score just lower than John McCain. McCain scored higher on family and defense issues; Root scored higher on economic issues.\n\nSo it looks like my search for a presidential candidate who can win my support based on my presidential selection criteria will have to continue."}, {"url": "https://www.factcheck.org/2010/02/obama-at-columbia-university/", "page_content": "Q: Is it true that nobody remembers Obama attending Columbia University?\n\nA: At least one of his classmates remembers him well, and the university proudly claims Obama.\n\nFULL QUESTION\n\n\n\nCan you check this out and see if it is true?\n\nThank you!\n\nI have always wondered why NO ONE ever came forward from Obama\u2019s past saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc. NO ONE, not one person has ever come forward from his past. VERY VERY STRANGE.\n\nThis should really be a cause for great concern. To those who voted for him, YOU HAVE ELECTED THE BIGGEST UNQUALIFIED FRAUD that America has ever known!\n\nThis is very interesting stuff. Sort of adds credence to the idea of The Manchurian Candidate thing having happened here! Stephanopoulos of ABC news said the same thing during the 08\u2032 campaign. He too was a classmate of BO\u2019s at Columbia class of 1984. He said he never had one class with him.\n\nWas he there?\n\nWhile he is such a great orator, why doesn\u2019t anyone in Obama\u2019s collegeclass remember him? Maybe he never attended class! Maybe he never attended Columbia ? He won\u2019t allow Colombia to release his records either. Suspicious isn\u2019t it???\n\nNOBODY REMEMBERS OBAMA AT COLUMBIA !!!!!!!\n\nLooking for evidence of Obama\u2019s past, Fox News contacted 400 Columbia University students from the period when Obama claims to have been there, but none remembered him.\n\nWayne Allyn Root was, like Obama, a political science major at Columbia who also graduated in 1983. In 2008, Root says of Obama, \"I don\u2019t know a single person at Columbia that knew him, and they all know me. I don\u2019t have a classmate who ever knew Barack Obama at Columbia . Ever! Nobody recalls him. I\u2019m not exaggerating, I\u2019m not kidding.\n\nRoot adds that he was also, like Obama, \"Class of \u201983 political science, pre-law\" and says, \"You don\u2019t get more exact or closer than that. Never met him in my life, don\u2019t know anyone who ever met him.\n\nAt the class reunion, our 20th reunion five years ago, who was asked to be the speaker of the class? Me. No one ever heard of Barack! And five years ago, nobody even knew who he was. The guy who writes the class notes, who\u2019s kind of the, as we say in New York , the macha who knows everybody, has yet to find a person, a human who ever met him. Is that not strange?\n\nIt\u2019s very strange. \"Obama\u2019s photograph does not appear in the school\u2019s yearbook and Obama consistently declines requests to talk about his years at Columbia , provide schoolrecords, or provide the name of any former classmates or friends while at Columbia .\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Allyn_Root#column-one\n\nNOTE: Root graduated as Valedictorian from his high school, Thornton-Donovan School, then graduated from Columbia University in 1983 as a PoliticalScience major (in the same class as President Barack Obama WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN IN).\n\nCan it be that BHO is a complete fraud?? More intrigue concerning \"The Man who wasn\u2019t there\u201d.\n\nFULL ANSWER\n\nWe\u2019re not sure why, but this false claim has been forwarded widely in recent days, judging by the number of queries we\u2019ve received.\n\nBarack Obama was a transfer student from California\u2019s Occidental College when he came to Columbia University in 1981 as a 20-year-old junior. More than 20,000 students currently attend Columbia. The enrollment in the early \u201980s might have been lower, but not everybody would have met or remembered Obama. And it\u2019s absolutely untrue that \"not one person has ever come forward\" from his years there, or that he is \"the man who wasn\u2019t there.\"\n\nColumbia University proudly claims Obama as a 1983 graduate. The university magazine Columbia College Today profiled him as far back as 2005, after he was elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\nLast year, the New York Times wrote about Phil Boerner, who roomed with the future president during his first year at Columbia. The article included excerpts from the Columbia student directory, showing Obama living during his junior year at 142 West 109th Street near Columbia\u2019s campus in New York City, and during his senior year at 339 East 94th Street. Boerner recalled that Obama sometimes wrapped himself in a sleeping bag to keep warm in the chilly apartment they shared, and that some nights he would cook chicken curry for dinner.\n\nIn an article published in Columbia College Today, Boerner also wrote:\n\nBoerner: I remember often eating breakfast with Barack at Tom\u2019s Restaurant on Broadway. Occasionally we went to The West End for beers. We enjoyed exploring museums such as the Guggenheim, the Met and the American Museum of Natural History, and browsing in bookstores such as the Strand and the Barnes & Noble opposite Columbia. We both liked taking long walks down Broadway on a Sunday afternoon, and listening to the silence of Central Park after a big snow. I also remember jogging the loop around Central Park with Barack.\n\nObama even published an article in a school magazine called the Sundial. A reporter for the conservative Human Events magazine recently called it \"a wholesale endorsement of all sorts of leftist claptrap fashionable at the time.\" The full article is available on the Web site of Politico.com. It was published in the issue dated March 10, 1983.\n\nThe e-mail incorrectly claims that ABC News\u2019 George Stephanopoulos was a classmate of Obama. They were both students at Columbia for about one academic year, but Stephanopoulos was a year ahead. Obama received his degree in 1983, while Stephanopoulos received his a year earlier, according to a university press release. Neither of them were \"class of 1984,\" as the message incorrectly claims.\n\nThe message recycles \u2014 and exaggerates to the point of falsification \u2014 some attacks that were raised in the heat of the 2008 presidential campaign. The claim that Fox News could not find any classmates who remembered Obama, for example, was published in a Sept. 11, 2008, Wall Street Journal editorial, which attacked then-candidate Obama for not releasing more information about his two years at the university. The message also makes much of Wayne Allyn Root\u2019s statement in an interview that he didn\u2019t know anybody who remembered Obama at Columbia. That appeared Sept. 5, 2008, in Reason magazine. What the message fails to mention is that Root was at the time a candidate for vice president on the Libertarian ticket. Root was stating that \"[a] vote for Obama is four years of Karl Marx,\" but even Root stopped short of claiming that Obama was not actually a student at Columbia.\n\n\u2013Brooks Jackson\n\nUpdate, Feb. 23: After we published this item, we received an e-mail from a woman who says she knew Obama when he was at Columbia. You can read her recollection of playing soccer with Obama on campus in our FactCheck Mailbag.\n\nCorrection, March 16: We originally used a quote from Phil Boerner, Obama\u2019s roommate at Columbia, that referred to their time together at Occidental College. We have changed that quote to another of Boerner\u2019s recollections about their time at Columbia.\n\nSources\n\n\"Barack Obama \u201983 Becomes First College Alumnus To Win Presidency.\" Columbia University. 5 Nov 2008.\n\nBoss-Bicak, Shira. \"Barack Obama \u201993: Is He the New Face of The Democratic Party?\" Columbia College Today.

People want smaller government and those governing they know they can trust.

But we must take advantage of it in order to be a catalyst for positive change as a political party. Wayne Allyn Root has demonstrated time and again his ability to promote Libertarian values and Libertarian principles to a large and wide group of receptive voters who know little about us. He understands focus and timing, quickly and efficiently directing his efforts towards voters who are finally ready to listen. He has the attributes, drive and talent to become a nationally known and positive figure in American politics. As the leader of the party, and with his talented team of supporters, he can make the Libertarian Party a major political force and set the groundwork to make it the major political party in America.\n\nWayne will lead the party to establish the foundation necessary to elect Libertarians in large numbers, thus driving our government in a Libertarian direction and causing the party to start to regularly fulfill its mission.\n\nWayne will lead the Libertarian Party to grow and flourish as never before, so that it can finally achieve the prominence in the National debate that our ideals on governance deserve.

The Libertarian Party is America\u2019s Party. Yet the Libertarian Party is failing to reach its potential to demonstrably expand liberty and freedom in the political arena. As chairman, Wayne Root will provide the energy, hard work, professionalism and commitment to smaller government that will move the Libertarian Party to new heights of political influence at all levels of government.

Wayne is the BIG TENT Libertarian leader, spokesman, rainmaker and CEO we so desperately need. I believe Wayne Root has the passion, vision and game plan to lead us to lead a Libertarian citizen revolution. We can elect Libertarians to office under Wayne\u2019s leadership. Therefore, I ask that you join me in voting for Wayne Root for LP Chair at this years National Convention\u201d\n\n-Ed Coleman, Indianapolis City-County Councilman,\n\nHighest-Elected Libertarian Officeholder in U.S.A.\n\n\u201cThe battle to maintain freedom is constant and everlasting. The strength required to stand fast for your principles can be immense. Having been a candidate for office, the chairman of a state party for four years, and a continuing volunteer, I am intimately familiar with what it takes to be successful. Friends have been lost, family has been alienated, money and time has been spent. These are some of the sacrifices that a defender of freedom makes. Wayne Root has made some of these sacrifices and not only has he continued to push forward but he has excelled. Wayne\u2019s dedication and energy devoted to the cause of liberty is unparalleled. The LP needs a leader who not only communicates the Libertarian message well but one who lives it. A businessman, a home school parent, an independent thinker, Wayne is the ideal choice to head the Libertarian Party. My vote for Chairman of the Libertarian Party will be going to Wayne Root. The time has come for the LP to lead this nation and Wayne is the man to be out front.\u201d\n\n-Travis Nicks\n\nMember, Judicial Committee of LP National\n\nFormer Chairman of Libertarian Party of Colorado\n\n\u201cAs I continue my journey with the Libertarian Party, I meet a lot of very good people.

As a leader in one of the largest state affiliates (top 5), I also realize that we must place the correct people, with a specific skill-set, in correct roles. We have done just that in Ohio.\n\nThat is why I endorse Wayne Allyn Root for LNC Chair. He not only has the talent to take the LP to the next level, but his energy is like a magnet that will draw in more people with needed skill-sets. This is our time to \u201cbuild and market the LP brand\u201d in a manner that resonates with millions of Americans who are looking for an alternative to the two old major parties.

Further, we need to increase the party\u2019s recognition to Americans, make our platform and ideas available, and show that we are the clear solution to the issues that Americans are facing. I believe that the person most capable of accomplishing these goals is Wayne Allyn Root.

While I have great respect for all our candidates running for National Chair, one is uniquely positioned to build the party- to raise money-to lead the organization to a new and higher level.

Ed and I are carrying the flag forward into battle as Governor and Lt. Governor candidates, and I don\u2019t want to turn around and see a debate club. I want to see political soldiers who aren\u2019t afraid to actually conquer that hill. Don\u2019t even think of telling me we can\u2019t win.

To get there, we need leadership that can not only communicate Libertarian concepts, but which can get the stage from which to do so. Wayne Allyn Root has proven that he can attract the media\u2019s attention, get the spotlight pointed at the Libertarian Party, and effectively communicate Libertarian ideas to the American people. The visibility that Wayne Allyn Root will bring to the LP and Libertarian candidates at this critical time will be invaluable, and he has my enthusiastic endorsement for the position of LNC Chair.\u201d\n\n-Ed Rutledge Chair, Libertarian Party of Chicago\n\nLibertarian Nominee, Lieutenant Governor of Illinois\n\nwww.Rutledge4Illinois.com\n\n\u201cWayne Root brings a commonsense and pragmatic approach which is essential for party growth and candidate election\u2026Wayne has the experience of raising significant funds.

Watching Wayne working tirelessly to promote Liberty and the Libertarian Party, bringing to the Party his enthusiasm, energy and dedication to the cause of limited government and individual freedom has been one of the main reasons I have stayed with the Party. Wayne has pr oven time and time again that he can gain positive media attention for the Libertarian Party. For these reasons I endorse Wayne Allyn Root for the Libertarian Party National Chairman.\u201d\n\n-Wilbur N. Wood III\n\nChairman. Libertarian Party of Virginia\n\n\u201cWayne Allyn Root has earned my support for LNC Chair. I must admit I\u2019ve come late to the WAR party, but I don\u2019t give my support easily. I\u2019ve watched Wayne Allyn Root closely the past two years and he\u2019s certainly earned my endorsement. I wish the LP had more activists like Wayne.\n\nI\u2019m excited to have such a powerful spokesperson leading the LP. Wayne Allyn Root will give the LP\n\na highly skilled communicator that will bring us positive attention, especially from media (where he shines). Already a daily presence (via his endless interviews and speaking engagements), WAR is what our party needs. I look forward to seeing his energetic and enthusiastic presence on TV next year as he leads our party to becoming the viable alternative we all want.\u201d\n\n-Joseph P. Silvestri\n\nChairman \u2013 Libertarian Party of Nevada\n\n2010 LP Nevada Candidate for U.S. Congress, District 3\n\n\u201cI believe the next two years are crucial for the Libertarian Party. We need a strong presence to make the case that libertarianism, the Libertarian Party, and the thousands of hard working libertarian volunteers ARE the answer in American government. We need a persuasive cheerleader for our team as libertarianism continues to go mainstream! No other leader in the Libertarian Party has worked harder over the last two years to put our message in front of new audiences like Wayne Allyn Root.\n\nI\u2019ve also had experience working with Mark Rutherford on a daily basis to grow our Libertarian Party in Indiana. I can testify that the wealth of experience in party building that Mark will bring to the team is significant. Our national office will be greatly strengthened by his counsel. Together, Root and Rutherford will help all of us achieve the goal of a more libertarian society by increasing the professionalism and public profile of the national LP.\u201d\n\n-Chris Spangle,\n\nExecutive Director of the Libertarian Party of Indiana\n\n\u201cWayne Allyn Root, is the person we need now in our Party to become National Chair. He is a very positive Libertarian, and wants us as a Party to move forward. To run candidates for office, and win. We need a spokesperson for our Party that can get out there on TV, Radio, and Internet to promote the Libertarian Party to its fullest potential. Someone that can sit next to a Democrat, or Republican, and get them to be quiet long enough to talk about the Libertarian Principles.\n\nHe\u2019s willing to go to different States to help Fund Raise for our State Parties. Our country needs our Party now to push the other two to the side, in order to create a Libertarian Society, and return our individual liberties and economic freedom. We have come a long way as a Party in 39 years, and I know some people are afraid that our Libertarian Principles are going to be washed up, or diluted. What Wayne Allyn Root is doing is putting our Principles in user friendly format, once people get hooked they do more research into our principles, and find out they are more Libertarian then they first thought. I will be one that will make sure our Libertarian Priniciples will not be compromised. We need Positive Energy, and Growth.\n\nThe three most important duties of a National Chair are being a good Spokesperson, Fundraiser, and Campaigner. We hire an Executive Director, and Staff to take care of all of the Administrative Duties. Wayne is going to have the Vice Chair be apart of the team, that will work very closely with our National Staff, all the State Chairs, and himself.\n\nThis is very important to make sure we have the best team in place to move our Party in the direction for positive growth, winning elections, and making our Party known in every household in America. I support Wayne Allyn Root for National Chair, and Mark Rutherford for National Vice Chair.\n\nOne thing that I will ask all Libertarians is whoever becomes our new National Chair, we need to get behind them to move our Party forward, if we do nothing for two years where will that get us? Another 4 years of Democrats in the White House in 2012. This is the time for the Libertarian Party, so let\u2019s make the best of it, we are making a very important decision on Memorial Weekend.\n\n-Lupe Diaz,\n\nState Chair, Libertarian Party of Illinois\n\n\u201cMy Fellow Libertarians,\n\nI write this letter to declare my endorsement and support for Wayne\n\nAllyn Root in his bid to become the next LNC chair. In the way of\n\nestablishing my own credibility with respect to this endorsement, I\n\noffer the following:\n\n1. I have been a Libertarian since 1990. Since that time, I\n\nhave served on my State Committee in a variety of capacities\n\nincluding State Chair, served six years as the Oregon party\u2019s\n\nExecutive Director, and have served on the LNC.\n\n2. I was my party\u2019s nominee for Oregon governor in 1998,\n\nmanaged several high profile Libertarian campaigns, and won five\n\nlocal non-partisan elections to public office. I have helped\n\nalmost a dozen other Libertarians win election to office. I\n\ncurrently serve as an elected commissioner and board president\n\nfor a water district serving 220,000 people and businesses like\n\nthe Nike world headquarters.\n\n3. I have successfully lobbied three election reform bills\n\nthrough the Oregon legislature which were signed into law,\n\nserved as a senior legislative aide in the Oregon senate, and\n\nspoke to any number of policy makers as a substitute host for a\n\nlocal talk radio show.\n\nIn doing all of the above, I have some to learn what it takes to build a\n\npolitical party: One needs the ability to communicate effectively and\n\nreach many, many, people. One needs the ability to build relationships\n\nand extend a hand to many kinds of people. One needs an entrepreneurial\n\nspirit a willingness to take reasonable risks, and the courage to put\n\ntheir own name, reputation and fortune on the line. One needs\n\ntremendous enthusiasm and the energy needed to turn that enthusiasm into\n\naction. Finally, one needs a vision for success and some kind of road\n\nmap to take us there.\n\nWayne Allyn Root is the only candidate for LNC Chair who possesses\n\nenough of all of these qualities to lurch our party out of the margins\n\nand into the center of political discourse. As Americans, we are losing\n\nour freedoms so rapidly that the LP can no longer continue to plod\n\nforward at the rate we have. We\u2019ve got to start moving, and Wayne Allyn\n\nRoot is the one to propel us to our next level of success.\u201d\n\n-Richard P. Burke\n\nLibertarian Party of Oregon\n\n\u201cIt is with great honor that I officially endorse you for National Chairman of the Libertarian Party. You have inspired me to run for office as a Libertarian and I look forward to you moving our party forward.\u201d\n\n-Michael J. Moon\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Candidate\n\nMichigan\u2019s 5th District\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s America, we in the Libertarian Party are presented with a\n\ngreat opportunity. My generation, and the generation after mine, are large,\n\nbroad groups ready to hear and learn about the Libertarian message, in greater\n\nnumbers than we\u2019ve seen in decades. Even the older generations are\n\nmore open to Liberty. People are starting to figure out that despite\n\nthe rhetoric, government only gets more intrusive, more wasteful and\n\nmore ridiculous every day; no matter who is in charge.\n\nSince our inception, we\u2019ve had the most consistent, freedom-loving\n\nplatform; rooted in liberty and based on the libertarian philosophy.\n\nBut, as we know from experience, philosophy and rhetoric alone simply\n\naren\u2019t enough.\n\nRepublicans often run as Libertarians, but once elected they govern\n\nlike big-government Democrats. We know from the successes of 1994,\n\nand 1980, that the libertarian message is appealing to the American\n\npublic. But having the best and most-consistent, liberty-loving\n\nplatform and philosophy just isn\u2019t enough, as history has shown us.\n\nWe are poised to see a repeat of 1994 and 1996, or more probable a\n\nrepeat of 1980 and 1984, in national politics. Republicans are again\n\nrunning on \u201cLiberty,\u201d but as history always repeats itself, they will\n\nabandon any real semblance of Liberty in exchange for slush-funds and\n\nback-room deals.\n\nTherefore, while every candidate for National Chair has at least one\n\nskill the LP needs to develop, it is my opinion that there is only one\n\ncandidate that can take our party to the next level. We need someone who\n\ncan market and sell the Libertarian Party; to sell our message to the\n\nAmerican people. We need someone with experience\n\nand success at marketing and selling; with the charisma, energy and\n\nthe drive to see us to the next level.\n\nWe need our party to be taken seriously, so when the next Harry\n\nBrowne, Ron Paul, Ed Clark, etc. decide to make a run for President,\n\nas a Libertarian in 2012 or 2016, that they are a political force with\n\na legitimate chance of winning.\n\nWe must take advantage of the prime situations currently presented to\n\nus; to expand our numbers, expand our finances, expand our influence,\n\nand expand our list of office-holders across America.We need to inform\n\nthe American public, through a modern sales and\n\nmarketing campaign, that America needs the Libertarian Party.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the Libertarian Party needs Wayne Allyn Root as our next chair.\u201d\n\nKen Moellman\n\nChair, Libertarian Party of Kentucky\n\n\u201cWayne Allyn Root, the 2008 Vice Presidential Nominee of the Libertarian Party, is without a doubt my pick for the chairmanship of the Party. Wayne excites me about the liberty movement, and he knows that the Libertarians need to be a party of action rather than a party of words and complaints. I serve as the communications director for Libertarian congressional candidate Jim Prindle, and I yearn for a proactive party to lead the nation towards the values of free enterprise and individual liberty. I saw Wayne speak at the Tea Party at Southfork Ranch, Texas, and I can tell you from experience that he knows what is most important and needed to ensure and even save our country\u2019s future.\n\nWayne, I give you my full support in this race, and look forward to your strong leadership!\u201d\n\n-Kevin Crouch (college student)\n\nThe Activist Report\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to endorse Mr. Wayne Allyn Root. He is without a doubt the best candidate for the LNC national chairmanship. His book, The Conscience of a Libertarian, as far as I am concerned is already a classic. It lays out a Libertarian blueprint for VICTORY. I\u2019m proud to support Wayne!!!!! We have no one who can come anywhere close to matching his enthusiasm!! Wayne\u2019s hero, Barry Goldwater, was also my political hero growing up!!\u201d\n\n-John Anderson\n\nLibertarian Party Candidate for Congress\n\nOhio, 7th Congressional District\n\nWayne,\n\n\u201cIt was great to meet you at the LPO convention. My wife and I will be headed to St. Louis for the LNC next weekend. That will be 2 votes for you for sure. I know for a fact that you are the right choice for this party. You have the vision, the plan, and energy to step this party up to the next level. We are on board for Root in 2010 and Root for America in 2012. Thank you for stepping up and running you will be a great leader for the party.\u201d\n\n-Jacob Dawson\n\nSecretary of Libertarian Party of Ohio\n\nLibertarian Candidate\n\nOhio Representative 86th District\n\n\u201cThe Libertarian Party must represent a balance to the Republicans and Democrats. Wayne Allyn Root understands that the Libertarian Party needs good communication with the media and the citizens of this nation if we are to start winning elections regularly, which must be our objective. His effort, knowledge, and enthusiasm for the Libertarian Party\u2019s success make him the ideal choice for Chair.\u201d\n\n-Ryan Liedtky\n\nAuthor of Wisdom: A Prelude to Liberty\n\nMember of Libertarian Party of Indiana State Central Committee\n\n\u201cAs Candidate for State House District 4 in the state of Colorado, it is my great pleasure to endorse Wayne Allyn Root for Chair of the National Libertarian Party. Wayne Root is a successful businessman, Libertarian activist and father. Without a doubt, Wayne is the ideal person to lead the Libertarian Party into the next decade. I will be proud to cast my vote for WAYNE ALLYN ROOT for NATIONAL CHAIR.\u201d\n\n-Marc Goddard 2010 Libertarian Candidate State House District #4\n\n\u201cTo my fellow members, I am proud to announce my endorsement of Wayne Allyn Root for National Chair. Wayne has a proven track record of getting the media attention we so desperately need. At this point the LP is very much like a startup company and Wayne has a track record of bringing success to small business his whole career. The time for us to make our mark for freedom is growing short. We must do everything in our power to give America a new choice, a real choice, a choice for freedom. We can no longer be just a party of principle. But we must bring our principles to America\u2019s mainstream debate. If you would like to bring freedom back to America then please join me in endorsing Wayne Root for chair.\u201d\n\n-Dana McLorn\n\nMember at large, executive committee\n\nCalifornia Libertarian party\n\nChair, Libertarian party of Ventura County\n\n\u201cWayne Allyn Root has the enthusiasm, business experience, and vision the Libertarian Party needs. As a hard-core libertarian, I appreciate Wayne\u2019s tireless efforts in spreading the message of liberty.\u201d\n\n-Adrian Galysh\n\nCandidate for California State Senate, District 20\n\n\u201cFor the last several years, I have been establishing election goals and building the Libertarian Party within our State. I have firsthand experience in what it takes to get people interested and dedicated to our purpose. It is with great confidence that I endorse Wayne Allyn Root for Chair of the LNC. Wayne has the necessary leadership and goal focused skills required to take this party to the next level. I offer my unwavering support for Mr. Root and encourage others to vote for him in the upcoming election for LNC Chair. The people in America are waiting for this Party to become all it promises to be. Wayne is the person to make this happen.\u201d\n\n-Danny Bedwell, Chair\n\nLibertarian Party of Mississippi\n\n\u201cWe are in a unique position this year, with American\u2019s ready for a truly viable third party. If we want to put the Libertarian Party in a position to be that third party, we need a leader that not only understands how to get media attention and get our word out there, we need a leader that understands libertarian principles and can communicate them. Wayne is the ONLY choice to accomplish both of these tasks, and he has my full endorsement.\u201d\n\n-Mathew A. Erickson III\n\nPublic Relations Manager\n\nLibertarian Party of Ohio\n\n\u201cI endorse Wayne A. Root for LP National Chair. I expect Libertarians to think and reach their own conclusions. This is Politics not Religion. We do not need \u201cTrue Believers\u201d\u2026 we need people of action who can think through situations efficiently and lay out a plan of action based on the changing landscape. We need warriors not believers. Wayne (W.A.R.) is such a warrior. I blindly follow no one. I blindly follow no creed. I am an independent sovereign. I expect no less from any leader. Wayne A. Root is the right man (W.A.R.rior) for the job right now. This is a fight for control of a country. We need warriors. We need feet on the ground, hands in the offices, and mouths at meetings. Let\u2019s go to W.A.R. people!\u201d\n\n-T. Lee Horne, III\n\nChairman, Libertarian Party of Louisiana\n\n\u201cI am pleased to announce that I have decided to formally endorse Wayne Allyn Root for the Chair of the Libertarian National Committee. I have had the opportunity to get to know Wayne over the past year, as he has been extremely involved in Libertarian politics. The thing that has always impressed me about Wayne is his passion and dedication. I know that he would bring these same qualities to the LNC, which is in desperate need of them.\n\nDespite the fact that Wayne has been busy traveling all over the country spreading the Libertarian message, he has always personally responded to my emails, which sometimes offer very blunt criticism or honest concerns. Wayne is the type of leader who is not afraid to confront criticism head on, and turn course when he sees a better path. I have reviewed the positions and credentials of each of the other four candidates for National Chair. Wayne is by far the most qualified to take the Libertarian Party from where it is, to where it needs to be.\n\nI have been a libertarian for many years, but only recently joined the Libertarian Party. Before joining, I needed reassurance that there were people willing to take the Libertarian Party from 3% of the vote to 35%. Nobody has been as relentless as Wayne Allyn Root in promoting a vision for success. It is now time to give Wayne an opportunity to execute his vision. There is only one candidate for National Chair who is willing to reject the status quo and do what it takes to build a political party ready to challenge the Republicans and Democrats. That candidate is Wayne Allyn Root.\u201d\n\n-Matthew P. Cantrell\n\nLibertarian Candidate for Ohio Treasurer of State\n\nMember of the Executive Committee, Central Committee and Finance Division Director for the Libertarian Party of Ohio.\n\n2010 Excellence Award winner for the LPO.\n\n\u201cHaving met Wayne Allyn Root personally and having had the opportunity to learn more about Wayne\u2019s vision for the the Libertarian Party, I can say without any reservation that I share his excitement and enthusiasm.\n\nAs both the Ventura County Libertarian Party Vice Chair and an At-Large member of the California Libertarian Party Executive Committee, it is my pleasure to extend my endorsement to Wayne Allyn Root for Libertarian National Committee Chair. \u201c\n\n-Flavio Fiumerodo\n\nVice Chair \u2013 Ventura County Libertarian Party\n\nAt-Large Member \u2013 California Libertarian Party\n\nSmall Business Owner\n\n\u201cPolicy differences between LP members are minute compared to the infighting of the R\u2019s and D\u2019s, because we all believe in liberty and the Constitution. Getting caught up in those differences is a mistake. To get to the next level\u2013winning statewide and national elections\u2013will take a leader with the ability to grow a brand on the national stage. Someone with leadership experience. Someone who will push our message with unrelenting energy and passion. Someone who can get the LP and our beliefs some much needed exposure. I know that man, and his name is Wayne A. Root.\u201d\n\nTodd Grayson\n\nEditor, The Buckeye Libertarian\n\nLP of Ohio\n\n\u201cWayne Allyn Root has the organizational skills to be an effective leader and the charisma and communications skills to effectively present Libertarian ideas to the general public. He will make a truly outstanding LNC Chair.\u201d\n\n-John Fockler,\n\nSecretary, Ohio LP Central Committee and LP Candidate for OH Senate, District 33.\n\n\u201cAs a member of the National Libertarian Party Platform Committee and an active volunteer with the Libertarian Party of Ohio, I fully believe Wayne Root is the most qualified person to lead the Libertarian Party out of the political basement. With his energetic personality, constant media attention and pragmatic Libertarian views, the Libertarian Party needs Wayne Root as the LNC chair.\u201d\n\n-Paul F. Campbell\n\nMember National Libertarian Party Platform Committee\n\nLibertarian Party of Ohio volunteer\n\n\u201cI am proud to support Wayne Allyn Root for National LP Chair and I will cast my vote for him at the Libertarian Party\u2019s National Convention, which is scheduled to take place in St. Louis, Missouri over Memorial Day Weekend. Of all the announced candidates for National Chair, I am convinced that only Wayne Allyn Root has the personality and energy to take the Libertarian Party to the next level. He alone can take advantage of the discontent currently being expressed against incumbents everywhere and to bring many of these individuals into the ranks of the Libertarian Party.\u201d\n\n-Alden Link\n\nNew York State Lt. Governor Nominee\n\n\u201cI am proud to endorse Wayne Root for LNC Chair. Wayne has been a tireless promoter of liberty, reaching out to millions of voters and working to bring them into the Libertarian Party. I have personally watched Wayne accept advice and criticism, then internalize it to become a more effective promoter of liberty.\u201d\n\nMichael Johnston\n\nVice Chair of the Libertarian Party of Ohio\n\nPolitical Director of the Libertarian Party of Ohio\n\nOhio House candidate \u2013 19th District\n\n\u201cIn my opinion Wayne A. Root is the most desirable candidate to lead the Libertarian Party in these troubled times. Libertarian principles are the ideal antidote for the problems that are vexing our nation, and our party must be more than a tiny footnote in history for our country to survive. Wayne has the vision, the energy and the talent that our party and our nation requires. I heartily and proudly endorse him.\u201d\n\n-Charlie Earl\n\nCommunication Director LP Ohio\n\nCandidate for Secretary of State\n\n\u201cI am the candidate for TX CD 27 and feel I have an excellent opportunity for success. Nevertheless, the challenge is tough and fundraising is difficult, as too many potential donors just don\u2019t faith in our seriousness or potential. Hence, my appreciation for your objectives and plans. Like many, I\u2019m new to the political arena but my political foundation was set and defined by Ronald Reagan, when I met him and heard him speak many years before he entered politics. I think the LP needs a Ronald Reagan-like communicator. I look forward to working with you, and heartily endorse Wayne Allyn Root for National Chairman.\u201d\n\n-Ed Mishou, Libertarian Nominee U.S. Congress, Texas District 27\n\nwww.Edmishou.com"}, {"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/why-obama-will-lose-in-a-landslide/", "page_content": "Claim: Wayne Allyn Root opined that President Obama will lose his re-election bid in 2012 by a landslide.\n\nCORRECTLY ATTRIBUTED\n\nExample: [Root, May 2012]\n\nMost political predictions are made by biased pollsters, pundits, or prognosticators who are either rooting for Republicans or Democrats. I am neither. I am a former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee, and a well-known Vegas oddsmaker with one of the most accurate records of predicting political races.\n\nNeither Obama nor Romney are my horses in the race. I believe both Republicans and Democrats have destroyed the U.S. economy and brought us to the edge of economic disaster. My vote will go to Libertarian Presidential candidate Gary Johnson in November, whom I believe has the most fiscally conservative track record of any Governor in modern U.S. political history. Without the bold spending cuts of a Gary Johnson or Ron Paul, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible to turnaround America.\n\nBut as an oddsmaker with a pretty remarkable track record of picking political races, I play no favorites. I simply use common sense to call them as I see them. Back in late December I released my New Years Predictions. I predicted back then- before a single GOP primary had been held, with Romney trailing for months to almost every GOP competitor from Rick Perry to Herman Cain to Newt- that Romney would easily rout his competition to win the GOP nomination by a landslide. I also predicted that the Presidential race between Obama and Romney would be very close until election day. But that on election day Romney would win by a landslide similar to Reagan-Carter in 1980.\n\nUnderstanding history, today I am even more convinced of a resounding Romney victory. 32 years ago at this moment in time, Reagan was losing by 9 points to Carter. Romney is right now running even in polls. So why do most pollsters give Obama the edge?\n\n[Rest of article here.]"}], "Wayne Allyn Root is a businessman.": [{"url": "https://rootforamerica.com/about/", "page_content": "Wayne Allyn Root (aka WAR) is not your typical CEO.

He is the host of The Wayne Allyn Root Show on KBET and the USA Radio Network and formerly on Newsmax TV. Root was an opinion columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nRoot was the Vice Presidential nominee for the Libertarian Party in the 2008 presidential election. In 2012, he left the Libertarian Party, rejoined the Republican Party, and endorsed and voted for Mitt Romney.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nRoot attended the Thornton-Donovan School in New Rochelle, New York, and was a member of the class of 1983 at Columbia University, studying pre-law and political science.\n\nIn June 2016, Root described himself as a \"Jew turned Evangelical Christian\". As of November 2016, Root described himself as Jewish, and says he considers Donald Trump to be the first Jewish president, in the same sense that Bill Clinton was often called the \"first black president\".\n\nCareer\n\nRoot worked for WNBC radio (now WFAN) in the early 1980s. From 1989 to 1991, he worked with the Financial News Network before its subsumption into CNBC.\n\nRoot was founder and chairman of Winning Edge International Inc. In the 2000s, he hosted Wayne Allyn Root's Winning Edge, a television show which promoted Root's sports handicapping operation.\n\nRoot co-hosted King of Vegas on Spike TV. He produced Ghost Adventures on the Travel Channel.\n\nRoot was a board member of Wealth Masters International (\"WMI\"), a now-defunct global financial services and education company based in Houston, Texas. In 2010 Norwegian authorities suspended WMI's sales, finding it to be an illegal pyramid scheme. Root was named in the finding.\n\nPolitics\n\nRoot had been a longtime Republican Party member and supporter who self-identified as a Libertarian Republican. He ran for a seat on the Westchester County Board of Legislators in 1983. In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party. Root's book outlining his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, was published in 2009.\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination. On May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the Libertarian Party presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who became the party's presidential nomination. Root then became the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee, securing the nod in the third round of voting for that nomination.\n\nThough in the same graduating class as Barack Obama at Columbia University, Root has stated on a number of occasions that he has no recollection of having met or seen Obama at Columbia. He has \"stopped short\" of actually claiming that Obama did not attend Columbia.\n\nIn 2010, Root ran for the position of chair of the Libertarian National Committee of the Libertarian Party. He was defeated by Mark Hinkle by a vote of 228\u2013281 in the third round. He subsequently succeeded in being elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an at-large member. At the 2012 Libertarian National Convention, Root again was elected to the Libertarian National Committee as an At-Large Member, despite being seen by some LP members as being part of the \"top-down faction.\" The party's 2012 presidential candidate Gary Johnson endorsed Root.\n\nReturn to the Republican Party\n\nIn September 2012, Root resigned all Libertarian Party positions, re-joined the Republican Party and endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential election. He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".\n\nRoot had announced that he intended to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2016, for the seat held by retiring Democratic Senator Harry Reid. However, he did not run. He supported Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nRoot was the opening speaker for Trump's rally in Las Vegas in late October 2016 during the presidential campaign. At the rally, Root, suggested that he wished ill upon Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin, hoping they met the same ending as Thelma & Louise. The lead characters in the film take their own lives by driving off a cliff. In his speech, Root said \"Trump warriors\" armed with \"pitchforks, jack hammers and blow torches\" would violently take over Washington D.C.: \"We're coming to tear it down. We're coming to rip it up. We're coming to kick your ass. And we're coming to put you in prison\", he said referring to a fantasy he had about Clinton and Abedin. Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, later told CNN that Root's \"conduct is completely unacceptable and does not reflect our campaign or our candidate\".\n\nIn August 2019, Root praised President Trump. Following Trump's assertion that Jews voting for the Democrats show \"either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty\", a comment which was rejected by his critics who said he was following an antisemitic canard, Root countered the claim. Root said that \"Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world, not just America, he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world...and the Jewish people in Israel love him like he's the King of Israel. They love him like he is the second coming of God.\" Later, President Donald Trump thanked Root on Twitter for \"the very nice words\" and shared what was said about him.\n\nIn October 2019, while speaking at a pro-Trump conference in Miami, Florida at the Trump National Doral Miami, Root reportedly boasted about a time in his childhood when, as one of the few white students at a predominantly black high school, he knocked one classmate unconscious and shattered another kid's teeth. \"My buddies and I were high-fiving and laughing,\" Root reportedly said during his speech. \"Man, it was funny.\" He reportedly went on to say that \"you've got to be a natural-born killer\" to win in politics.\n\nPromotion of conspiracy theories and falsehoods\n\nRoot is known for spreading conspiracy theories and false information.\n\nRoot was a leading proponent of the conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. Root falsely claimed that Obama was not a student at Columbia University. He later stated in a 2012 interview with Sean Hannity that he believed Obama was a \"foreign exchange student\" there. He has repeatedly described Obama as a \"Marxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, globalist, middle class-hating, Muslim sympathizer\". In 2017, he claimed that Obama was gay, called him \"Bathhouse Barry\" and said that he had info from Obama's \"friends in Chicago\" about his \"sordid past\". In 2014, he described Obama as a \"Manchurian candidate\", possibly hired by the Bilderberg Group to destroy the United States and \"kill all of us\".\n\nHe promoted conspiracy theories around the murder of Seth Rich, and at various times suggested that Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Hillary Clinton, Donna Brazile, Bill Clinton, Eric Schneiderman and John Podesta were involved in the murder.\n\nDuring the white supremacist Unite the Right rally, Root falsely claimed that blaming white supremacist James Alex Fields Jr. for killing Heather Heyer was \"such B.S. Probably paid actors & infiltrators hired by Soros. No conservative I've ever met commits violence. EVER.\"\n\nOn the night of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, in which 58 people were murdered, Root tweeted: \"Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack.\" Police later determined only one shooter\u2014a non-religious American\u2014was involved.\n\nRoot argued that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is motivated by \"penis envy\", because \"Mueller's is smaller than Trump's.\"\n\nControversies\n\nLegal problems\n\nOn March 19\u201321, 2020, Chief Health Care Bureau Lisa Landau and New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, ordered Root to stop advertising My Doctor Suggests, LLC on KBET and USA Radio Network citing violations of state laws on deceptive acts and practices.\n\nOn April 29, 2020, Gordon Pedersen of My Doctor Suggests LLC and GP Silver LLC was ordered by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Trump administration to permanently stop advertising and selling all of these products out there. A hearing on the government\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction is set for May 12, 2020.\n\nFeud with KDWN co-host Brian Shapiro of The Vegas Take\n\nOn March 20, 2020, Root was fired from the Las Vegas Review-Journal for a second time citing violations of journalistic standards by J. Keith Moyer and for feuding with KDWN co-host Brian Shapiro of The Vegas Take during a morning interview. Root was also fired from Newsmax as Newsmax TV discontinued their simulcast of the show at the same time.\n\nFeud with former Nevada State Treasurer Dan Schwartz\n\nOn April 16, 2020, Root on Facebook and Twitter slammed Dan Schwartz for attacking Daniel Rodimer on a TV ad by permanently banning him on his radio show and accusing him of libel and slander by referring him as persona non grata."}, {"url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/wayne-allyn-root-trumps-rally-opener-is-a-conspiracy-theorist-who-thinks-the-vegas-shooter-was-isis", "page_content": "\u201cBig day today. I\u2019m opening speaker 4 President of United States,\u201d Wayne Allyn Root, a Las Vegas Review-Journal columnist and former Libertarian Party vice-presidential nominee, boasted Thursday morning on Twitter, hours before President Trump headlines a Las Vegas rally to elect a Republican ticket in the state.\n\n\u201c@realDonaldTrump personally requested Wayne Root as opening speaker to welcome crowd,\u201d the right-wing commentator claimed. \u201cThank u Mr. President.\u201d\n\nThe opening act makes sense considering Root\u2019s long-running, often sycophantic friendship with the president.\n\nTrump wrote a glowing blurb for Root\u2019s 2015 book Angry White Male: How the Donald Trump Phenomenon is Changing America (which, coincidentally, featured a foreword by shady ex-Trump confidant Roger Stone). Root, in turn, emceed the future president\u2019s 2015 campaign rally in Vegas, and later offered to become Trump\u2019s own \u201cKarl Rove\u201d should he win the election. Earlier this year, Root bragged about spending a \u201cmagical evening\u201d with President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAnd in many ways, Root is the Las Vegas version of Trump: He\u2019s a ruthless self-promoter from New York; a heavily airbrushed and often-gaudy TV personality whose flashy antics and love of chintz have made him synonymous with a city.\n\nMoreover, just like the president, Root is now a bombastic right-wing media personality obsessed with the Clintons, Obama, the physical appearance of liberals, and the batshit conspiracy theories that comport with his worldview.\n\nPerhaps most infamously, when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire and killed 58 people at a country-music festival on the Vegas strip last fall, Root proclaimed on Twitter, without a shred of evidence: \u201cThis is real thing. Clearly coordinated Muslim terror attack. PRAY for our Vegas police. PRAY for victims. VERY bad. Awful.\u201d\n\nAfter sustained outcry over falsely linking a deadly mass shooting to Islamic terror, Root refused to apologize or back down, instead claiming he heard about the connection from \u201ccredible news sources,\u201d which, at that time, meant far-right conspiratorial websites like The Gateway Pundit. \u201cI report it as I hear it,\u201d Root added.\n\nDays later, on his radio show, Root went off the rails, once again claiming \u201cISIS fingerprints were all over this thing,\u201d before bashing the critics of his radical conspiracy-mongering: \u201cI have nothing to worry about so I laugh in their liberal commie faces, their liberal commie Muslim-sympathizer faces. Screw you! Come and get me. Screw you.\u201d\n\nMonths earlier, after it was revealed that a white nationalist allegedly murdered a female anti-racism protester during the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Root shared a particularly deranged theory: \u201cSuch B.S,\u201d he said of the alleged killer\u2019s far-right politics. \u201cProbably paid actors & infiltrators hired by Soros. No conservative I\u2019ve ever met commits violence. EVER.\u201d\n\nBeyond waxing crazy about deadly news events, Root has also been a leading voice for the right-wing conspiracy theory that Democratic officials ordered the murder of former DNC staffer Seth Rich for allegedly passing stolen emails to WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cHe was murdered because he was the guy that gave all the DNC files to Julian Assange and Wikileaks,\u201d Root asserted on his radio show in June 2018, as Right Wing Watch first reported. \u201cThey just killed him for no reason and nobody seems to be interested in finding the killer. And it sure seems to me to point to leading Democrats\u2014Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the DNC, the Clintons, Hillary Clinton, all the above, Donna Brazile, all the above, seem to be mixed up in this, they all had a motive to kill this guy.\u201d\n\nAt other points, he has suggested that Rich\u2019s murderer was former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, former President Bill Clinton, or Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman John Podesta.\n\nIn one particularly bizarre tweet, Root wrote: \u201cI think Seth Rich murder is HUGE issue,\u201d boasting in strikingly Trumpian language that \u201cI understand people and psychology. Something is VERY wrong.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, Root was an early supporter of Trump\u2019s crusade to prove true the completely debunked conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States. \u201cGood job Donald Trump,\u201d Root tweeted in 2011, long before the birther-in-chief became commander-in-chief. \u201cI can produce my birth certificate in 1 minute. I have it in my safe.\u201d\n\nThe Vegas stalwart would later go on to claim he never was a birther, but simply someone who believed Obama hid dark secrets hidden beneath mundane documents like his college transcripts. Seemingly missing the connotative connection to birtherism, Root once told Hannity that he believes Obama was a \u201cforeign exchange student\u201d at Columbia University.\n\nHe has certainly never shied away from other racially tinged attacks on the first black U.S. president. Obama was a \u201cMarxist, anti-American, anti-Israel, globalist, middle class-hating, Muslim sympathizer,\u201d Root has repeatedly written. At one point, Root called Obama the \u201cfirst Muslim president\u201d in a column that sought to reveal the ex-president\u2018s \u201ctrue religious loyalties.\u201d\n\nThroughout Obama\u2019s eight years in office, Root claimed he was a \u201cManchurian candidate\u201d who was sent\u2014possibly by the Bilderberg Group\u2014to \u201cdestroy this country\u201d from within and \u201ckill all of us.\u201d He further maintained that Obama was gay, referring to him as \u201cBathhouse Barry\u201d and claiming that his \u201cfriends in Chicago\u201d told him the president had a \u201csordid past.\u201d\n\nWhile opening a 2016 Trump rally in Vegas, Root reportedly received rapturous applause by suggesting Clinton and her top aide Huma Abedin will meet the same deadly fate as two popular film characters who drove off a cliff. \u201cWe all get our wish,\" Root said of the Clinton-Abedin relationship. \u201cThe ending is like Thelma and Louise.\u201d\n\nBeyond the usual bevy of far-right conspiracy theories and inflammatory rhetoric, Root has seemingly fixated on the sexuality and physical appearances of his liberal enemies.\n\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Root posited earlier this year, because he has \u201cpenis envy.\u201d The radio host declared: \u201cMueller\u2019s is smaller than Trump\u2019s.\u201d According to Right Wing Watch, Root has claimed that \u201call liberal men are gay\u201d and \u201call liberal women are ugly.\u201d\n\nHe has lamented how HBO host John Oliver married a \u201cSTUNNING. GORGEOUS\u2026 Trophy Wife\u201d instead of \u201cplain liberal women.\u201d And he has suggested that MSNBC host Joe Scarborough only became critical of Trump so he could have \u201csex w/hot blonde\u201d Mika Brzezinski, his fianc\u00e9e and co-host.\n\nDuring one bonkers radio segment, Root expressed dismay that some of his social-media critics have referred to him as an old man. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference in when you call someone \u2018old\u2019 versus when you call someone the \u2018N-word,\u2019\u201d the radio-host claimed. \u201cThere\u2019s no difference. It\u2019s a lack of respect. It\u2019s filthy. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nIn a normal world, Root\u2019s level of unabashed buffoonery would put him more at home with the QAnon-flag and Seth Rich poster-toting weirdos that will flock to the Las Vegas Convention Center on Thursday night. But instead he\u2019s the speaker a U.S. president reportedly \u201cpersonally requested\u201d to open for him at a nationally televised event."}, {"url": "https://www.wikicu.com/Wayne_Allyn_Root", "page_content": "W.A.R. in his natural habitat\n\nWayne Allyn Root (a.k.a.

In 2007, Root ended his association with the Republican Party and joined the Libertarian Party. He wrote a book on his libertarian views, The Conscience of a Libertarian, which was published in 2009.\n\nIn September 2012, Root left the LP and announced his return to major party politics.\n\n2008 presidential campaign\n\nOn May 4, 2007, Root declared his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's 2008 presidential nomination on Las Vegas' Fox 5 television station. On February 5, 2008, he placed second in the Missouri Libertarian presidential primary with 18% of the vote (47% voted for \"Uncommitted\"). He came in second in Arizona and third in California, without campaigning in any of these states.\n\nOn May 25, 2008, Root advanced to the fifth ballot of the LP presidential nomination vote at the 2008 Libertarian National Convention before being eliminated and endorsing Bob Barr, who went on to the party's presidential nomination.

He predicted Romney would win the election against incumbent President Barack Obama, citing, among other factors, that the \"Enthusiasm Factor\" for Romney was \"huge\".\n\nFollowing Romney's defeat in the election, Root commented in a Fox News editorial: \"Well, I was wrong. The 2012 electorate looked almost identical to 2008. Obama's supporters didn\u2019t just come for a second helping of misery\u2014they came out enthusiastically and even appeared to cheer for more.\"\n\nPotential 2016 U.S. Senate campaign\n\nRoot has announced that he intends to run as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate from Nevada, the seat currently held by Democratic Senator Harry Reid.\n\nPolitical positions\n\nRoot supports smaller government, reduced spending, reduced entitlements, reduced bureaucracy, dramatically lower taxes, and greater personal freedom for all individuals.

Root and his wife choose to home-school their children. He is also a strong supporter of gun rights for the individual. Root is a small businessman who believes the 2-party system is built on corruption, greed and bribery. He is a fiscal conservative. He believes most social issues should be determined at the state and local level. Root calls for the repeal of the income tax and favors replacing it, as well as all other sources of federal tax revenues, with a tax on each state in proportion to its population, with each state deciding for itself how to raise its share of the money, as is mentioned in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDuring the Ebola epidemic, Root said that President Obama must be impeached \"before he kills us all\" with terrorists who have the Ebola virus. Root also makes extreme voter fraud allegations, saying President Obama only won reelection because \u201cDemocratic voters across this country are voting four times, five times, 10 times each for the Democrats.\u201d Root wrote a column that said Obama was using the Ferguson protests as part of \"his plan to destroy this country.\"\n\nIn another published commentary, Root speculated that President Obama attended Columbia University as a foreign exchange student, citing his \"gut instinct\" as evidence, and that President Obama was indoctrinated into Marxism while attending Columbia. Root was specifically referring to the fact that Obama's childhood years spent with his mother in Indonesia. In response to Senator Harry Reid's speculation about Mitt Romney's tax returns, Root offered speculation on Obama's college records.\n\nAfter being audited by the Internal Revenue Service, Root wrote a column in May 2015 calling the audit \"a political conspiracy coordinated by leading Democrats to either destroy me, bankrupt me, or silence me.\"\n\nRoot's appeared on The Daily Show program in 2013, where he accused the IRS of profiling him for his political beliefs while he simultaneously spoke in favor of profiling certain racial, ethnic, and religious groups; Root later complained that The Daily Show \"literally committed fraud\" with selective editing.\n\nRoot's theories involving Hillary Clinton include his speculation that Clinton is blackmailing the Federal Bureau of Investigation to avoid prosecution and that Clinton was conspiring with the ACORN organization to steal the 2016 presidential election, even though ACORN no longer existed at that time.\n\nIn a Twitter post reacting to the Supreme Court's upholding of Obamacare, Root said he believed that Chief Justice John Roberts is also being \"blackmailed or intimidated,\" which he added is \"like John Boehner\"\n\nPersonal life\n\nRoot resides in Henderson, Nevada with his wife Debra.
