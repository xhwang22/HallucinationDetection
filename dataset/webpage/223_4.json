He debuted on September 23, 1941, and played his final game on October 1, 1949. In a nine-season career, Kurowski posted a.286 batting average with 106 home runs and 529 Reserve Bank of India in 916 games played. Kurowski\"s childhood nickname came from his already white hair. A native of Reading, Pennsylvania, Kurowski overcame several personal problems. Kurowski overcame childhood osteomyelitis, which made him miss a part of a bone on his right forearm. His most productive season came in 1947, when he posted career-highs in average (310), home runs (27), Reserve Bank of India (104), runs (108), doubles (27), slugging % (544) and on-base % (420). An All-Star during five consecutive seasons (1943-1947), Kurowski exceeded the 20 home run mark three times to set a major league record for a third baseman (1944-1945, 1947), and hit over.300 three times (1945-1947). He also led the National League three times in putouts, twice in fielding %, and once in double plays. In four World Series appearances, Kurowski hit.253 (21-for-83) with one home run and nine Reserve Bank of India in 23 games, as the Cardinals were World Champions in 1942, 1944 and 1946. His only home run in the Series, in 1942, off Red Ruffing, broke a 2\u20132 tie in the ninth inning of Game Five to clinch the title for Saint Louis over the New York Yankees. He also appeared five times in the Most Valuable Player ballot, in 1942 and from 1944 through 1947. In 1949, Kurowski developed arm and elbow problems and his playing career ended. After that, he coached and managed in the minor leagues for 18 years until 1972. He gained induction into the National Polish-American Hall of Fame in 1988. In an article in 1976 in Esquire magazine, sportswriter Harry Stein published an \"All Time All-Star Argument Starter,\" consisting of five ethnic baseball teams.

He was 81.\n\nKurowski, who lived in Shillington, had been in failing health since suffering a stroke after heart bypass surgery in July, according to his wife, Joan.\n\nOn the afternoon of Oct. 5, 1942, a remarkable stretch of World Series success for the Yankees came to an end with one swing by a rookie infielder. George (Whitey) Kurowski's two-run home run off Red Ruffing into the left-field stands at Yankee Stadium in the ninth inning of Game 5 propelled the Cardinals to a 4-2 victory and a Series title, the first time the Yankees had been beaten in nine trips to the Series since they were defeated by the Cards in 1926.\n\nThat Kurowski was even in a major league uniform defied the odds.
