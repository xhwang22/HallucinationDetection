He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "http://www.polishsportshof.com/portfolio_page/billy-burkowski-burke/", "page_content": "Description\n\nInducted June 9, 2005\n\nBorn William Burkowski in Union City, Connecticut, Burke played on the PGA Tour with great success. His first tour victory came in his second year on tour winning the prestigious North-South Open in 1928. Playing with a slightly unorthodox grip because of the loss of parts of two fingers on his left hand, Burke made golfing record books when he won the 1931 U.S. Open at Inverness in Toledo. He was the first person to win a major playing steel-shafted clubs and he did it by outdueling George Von Elm in a 72-hole playoff. It was the longest playoff ever played. He won 10 times on the tour and twice finished third in the Masters. Burke was also considered one of the finest Ryder Cup team members of his era being undefeated in Ryder Cup play in 1931 and 1933. He was inducted in the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966.\n\nINDUCTION BANQUET PROGRAM STORY \u2014 June 9, 2005\n\nU.S. Open and Ryder Cup Champion\n\nBy: Tom Tarapacki\n\nNPASHF Board Member\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century there were increasing numbers of Polish immigrants in America, but not many were playing significant roles in sports. The reason for that was mainly twofold: in large part they were unfamiliar with American sports, and were too busy working to find time to play. When their children did start to play sports in large numbers in the 1920s and 1930s, they tended to gravitate to \u201cworking class\u201d sports like baseball and football. It was therefore quite surprising when, in the 1930s, the son of Polish immigrants known as Bill Burke became one of the most prominent names in the sport of golf.\n\nIn 1931 Burke \u2014 born William Burkowski in Union City Connecticut \u2014 became the first person to win a major playing with steel-shafted clubs when he won the U.S. Open. He did it by out dueling George Von Elm in the longest playoff ever played.\n\nFor many years, American golf was largely considered the domain of the wealthy, a \u201ccountry club sport\u201d like tennis or polo. It was unusual for the son of a Polish-born foundry worker to even take up the sport, much less excel at it. The story goes that 15-year-old Burkowski was with playing some friends when the caddie master at the Naugatuck Golf Club, desperate for caddies, recruited him to carry clubs for golfers. He eventually started playing the game himself. He couldn\u2019t afford clubs or a bag, so some members gave him clubs and he carried them in his hands. He kept playing despite losing the ring finger and severely injuring the little finger on his left hand while working in a local foundry. At age 16 \u201cThe Boy Marvel\u201d won the Naugatuck club championship in a driving rainstorm. Supporters bought him a golf bag so he could play in the state amateur, which he lost on the final hole. They following year, 1923, he went on to win the state amateur. That victory led to Burkowski, who anglicized his name to Burke, getting a job as a golf pro at the Mattatuck Golf Course in Waterbury.\n\nIn 1931 Burke went to the U.S. Open at the Inverness Club in Toledo. He trailed the leader, George Von Elm of California, by two strokes at the start of the 36-hole final round on Sunday, July 4th. At the end of regular play, Burke and Von Elm were tied. On Monday following day they played a 36-hole playoff to decide the title, and ended the day still tied. On Tuesday they launched another 36-hole playoff, but this time Burke ended up winning by a single stroke. After 144 holes and 589 stokes, Billy Burke was the U.S. Open champion. Burke\u2019s victory was particularly significant not only because he used steel-shafted clubs, but also because the lengthy playoff caused a change in all future playoff formats.\n\nAlthough the Open win was the high point, Burke enjoyed a fine career. He won 10 career tournaments, and finished third at the Masters twice. Burke played in 159 career PGA Tour tournaments and finished in the top 10 an amazing 80 times. He was also considered one of the finest Ryder Cup team members of his era going undefeated in the 1931 and 1933 Ryder Cups. Burke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966 and died in Florida in 1972.\n\nBilly Burke was a true pioneer, excelling in the sport of golf years before other outstanding Polish-American golfers like Ed Furgol and Bob Toski appeared on the scene."}, {"url": "https://www.rydercup.com/history", "page_content": "4 Charles Whitcombe GB Captain 8 Walter Hagen USA Captain\n\nSouthport and Ainsdale Golf Club, Southport, England\n\nThe first victory by a U.S. Ryder Cup Team on British soil was achieved by a balanced unit featuring rookies Sam Snead, runner-up in that year\u2019s U.S. Open, Byron Nelson and Ed Dudley. Walter Hagen served as non-playing captain for the first time, while his team faced the most unpleasant weather in the series. The U.S. built a 2-1-1 lead after the first-day foursomes and headed into the second day, which featured eight singles matches contested in pouring rain through most of the competition. Midway through the final day, Sir Henry Cotton managed a 5-and-3 victory over Tony Manero. That produced a 4-4 tie that gave the British momentary hope.\n\n\n\nThe singles matches, contested over 36 holes, however, featured an \u201cintermission.\u201d By lunch, the Americans had the advantage in three of the last four singles, and Percy Alliss retained the final bid for the British with a 1-up lead over Gene Sarazen after 18 holes. Alliss gradually built his lead to three holes, before Sarazen rallied and squared the match after 14 holes. At the par-3 15th, Alliss\u2019 tee shot found the green. Sarazen hit an errant tee shot that bounced back off a spectator and on to the green. Sarazen didn\u2019t miss a cue and holed his putt for a birdie and held on for a 1-up victory. The Americans went on to win the final three matches, highlighted by Sam Snead\u2019s 5-and-4 victory over Richard Burton. The final tally \u2013 8-4 in favor of the Americans.\n\n\n\nThe Ryder Cup was to be resumed in November 1939 at Ponte Vedra (Fla.) Country Club, but the dark clouds of war were breaking rapidly across Europe. The competition would not be renewed for another decade."}, {"url": "https://www.rydercup.com/history/era-2", "page_content": "51/2 Henry Cotton GB Captain 61/2 Lloyd Mangrum USA Captain\n\nWentworth Golf Club, Wentworth, England\n\nIn the most hotly contested Ryder Cup since 1933, the Americans didn\u2019t gain the 6.5 to 5.5 victory until the waning hour of the singles matches, when Bernard Hunt missed a putt on the 18th green at Wentworth Golf Club to half with Dave Douglas. Earlier, teammate Peter Alliss took a 6 at the final hole to drop a 1-up decision to Jim Turnesa.\n\n\n\nThe American team didn\u2019t include Ben Hogan, who was enjoying his greatest year and one of the greatest seasons in golf history. Hogan limited his play to 72-hole, four-day, medal-play events. This precluded his participating in both the PGA Championship (which was conducted too early following his Open Championship victory) and the Ryder Cup. Both the PGA Championship and Ryder Cup had 36-hole matches during this period. Walter Burkemo took Hogan\u2019s place and was joined by newly crowned Canadian Open champion Douglas, Ted Kroll and former U.S. Open Champion Cary Middlecoff. Also among the rookies was Ireland\u2019s Harry Bradshaw, who gained a start in the opening day foursomes while veterans Dai Rees and Max Faulkner were held out of the competition by Captain Sir Henry Cotton.\n\n\n\nIn an effort to build camaraderie before the Ryder Cup, Cotton took his players to London to see the play \u201cGuys and Dolls.\u201d However, the relaxation didn\u2019t help his team as the U.S. took a 3-1 lead after the foursomes. Alliss and Hunt, unfortunately, shouldered the burden in the waning moments of the singles Alliss chunked a chip shot on the 18th green and eventually suffered a double-bogey 6 for his half with Turnesa. Hunt walked through a crowd up the final fairway. He had pushed his second shot near a big tree short and right of the green. He overshot the green with his approach and needed three putts from there to lose the hole and half with Douglas. Following Ryder Cup play, U.S. Captain Lloyd Mangrum said he would \u201cnever, never captain an American Team again because of the 9,000 deaths I suffered in the last hour.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.rydercup.com/history/era-3", "page_content": "71/2 Brian Huggett GB & I Captain 121/2 Dow Finsterwald USA Captain\n\nRoyal Lytham & St. Annes, St. Annes, England\n\nThe Great Britain-Ireland Team had lobbied for another format change, reducing the number of matches by nearly a third and leaving 20 total points to be decided. This proved a disastrous move due to a 45-minute interval between starting times to accommodate television broadcasts. The USA Team quickly jumped out to an advantage by taking a 3.5 to 1.5 margin the opening day of foursomes and a 4-1 advantage in the second-day four-balls. Though the teams split the singles, 5-5, the U.S. had won its 10th straight Ryder Cup, this time by a margin of 12.5 to 7.5. England\u2019s Sir Nick Faldo competed despite glandular fever and won all three of his matches. Fellow countryman Peter Dawson became the first left-hander to play for either team. This was the final Ryder Cup before a major upheaval took place that would produce unlimited popularity and competitive balance in the event.\n\n\n\nDuring the 1977 Ryder Cup, officials of the PGA of America and the PGA of Great Britain conferred about allowing players from continental Europe into the competition. Jack Nicklaus made his own pitch for the change during the competition in a meeting with Lord Derby.
