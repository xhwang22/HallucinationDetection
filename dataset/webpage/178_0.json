Billboard magazine described Davis\u2019s sound as \u201crhythmically rich\u201d with \u201cexpressive, honeyed vocals.\u201d Her cover of DiFranco\u2019s \u201c32 Flavors\u201d became a favorite on alternative radio stations, and her album drew a range of listeners with its mix of pop, jazz, and folk sounds. The release of a second album in 2001 called Fortune Cookies proved that Davis had staying power. Straddling the line between popular and alternative rock, she offered music with more emotion and depth than the teen pop ballads in vogue at the time.\n\nBorn and raised in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village, Davis grew up surrounded by music. Her African American father, Walter Davis, Jr., was a respected jazz pianist, and her Irish-Scottish mother, Anna Schonfield, was a jazz singer. A life in music seemed inevitable for Davis. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve avoided going into this direction,\u201d she told David Chiu of UniverCity magazine.\n\nAs a young adult Davis absorbed the R&B of Stevie Wonder, the jazz of Charlie Parker and Clifford Brown, and the folk of female vocalist Joni Mitchell, all of whom she has credited as influences. She studied briefly at Mohawk Valley Community College in upstate New York where, with her love of animals, she considered becoming a veterinarian. In the meantime she learned to play guitar and started writing her own songs. Later she would joke that her only audience at the time was her dog, Homer. Fame was the last thing on her mind when a music-industry talent representative took an interest in her: \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for a record deal,\u201d Davis recalled to SonicNet.com. \u201cI made a demo tape with a friend\u2026 who sent it around to people, and somehow it fell into the hands of Elektra Records. It ended up being lucky.\u201d Recognizing Davis\u2019s potential, the Elektra agent called her in to develop her talent.\n\nDavis then prepared for her debut, polishing her songs and composing new tunes on her guitar. She worked closely with her producer and partner, Ed Tuton, but ultimately her journey was a personal one. \u201cMaking [my first] record was a discovery process for me,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cI went into it thinking I wanted to collaborate and find material, but somewhere along the line I realized that it was going to have to come from me.\u201d While she was creating Blame It on Me, Davis met one of her idols, R&B singer-songwriter Bill Withers, whose hits include \u201cLean on Me\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t No Sunshine.\u201d Davis credits Withers for steering her down the right path. \u201cHe told me not to waste my chance,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cTo do something meaningful.\u201d\n\nBlame It on Me was released in 1997 and was hailed by critics as a shining debut.

Yet the biggest hit on the album was Davis\u2019s reworking of Ani DiFranco\u2019s \u201c32 Flavors,\u201d which got much more radio airplay than the original song. Although she was initially supportive of the cover version, DiFranco changed her tune when her fans resented Davis\u2019s success with the song. \u201cIt\u2019s only after [DiFranco\u2019s] fans started reacting that her feelings started to change, and that\u2019s too bad,\u201d Davis told SonicNet.com. \u201c[The cover] has done only good things. I changed the lyrics and stuff but I didn\u2019t take any credit. She\u2019s laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d\n\nAfter her debut release, Davis toured with the muchtouted Lilith Fair and H.O.R.D.E. (Horizons of Rock Developing Everywhere). She performed live with Ben Harper, Blues Traveler, and Ziggy Marley, gaining a reputation as a dynamic live performer with crowd-drawing appeal. Although Davis had some popular singles, her album was not a runaway success. \u201cWhen I came off the road [from touring for Blame], I was lost,\u201d she told Billboard magazine. \u201cI kept waiting for the album to take off, but it never did. During such times, I have to remind myself not to get lost in the despair\u2026. So, my inner voice gets louder and saves me.\u201d\n\nA four-year recording hiatus followed Blame It on Me, leaving fans to wonder where Davis had gone. She spent the time soul-searching, writing introspective songs, and looking for the next step. She came out with a second album, Fortune Cookies, in October of 2001, which she described to Billboard as \u201csimpler and more to the point, a bit more raw and urban.\u201d Fortune Cookies also grew out of her collaboration with producer Ed Tuton. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural working with him,\u201d Davis stated on the Elektra Records website. \u201cHe helped keep the songs pure. He has a wonderful way of helping me get to just what I\u2019m thinking and feeling. That\u2019s important when you\u2019re working with songs that are very personal.\u201d\n\nLooking for a fresh, spontaneous sound, Davis wrote some of the lyrics in the studio. With the song \u201cWhen You Became King,\u201d she drew upon the influence of her longtime female singer-songwriter idol, Joni Mitchell. \u201cIt\u2019s a particular fingerpicking pattern that I learned to copy from [Mitchell\u2019s] records when I learned to play back in college,\u201d Davis said on her website. \u201cIt\u2019s so fun to do. I wrote it without ever really intending that it become a song. I was sort of exercising and playing. It had a nice feel to it.\u201d\n\nFortune Cookies came out during a different time for female vocalists, when the songs of teen pop sensations were gaining more radio airtime than those of groundbreaking, independent artists. Davis\u2019s record company, Elektra, marketed her as an authentic alternative to the overproduced, \u201cmanufactured\u201d sounds glutting the market. Response to her cover of Third Eye Blind\u2019s \u201cI Want You\u201d was positive, and reviewers once again waxed lyrical about the songsmith\u2019s breathy voice and funky rhythms.\n\nBlame It on Me, Elektra/Asylum, 1997.\n\nFortune Cookies, Elektra/Asylum, 2001.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBillboard, October 3, 2001, p. 14.\n\nOnline\n\n\u201cAlana Davis,\u201d All Music Guide, http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll (December 10, 2001).\n\n\u201cAlana Davis,\u201d UniverCity, http://members/tripod/comralana_davis/interviews/university.html (December 10, 2001).\n\n\u201cAlana Davis Biography,\u201d RollingStone.com, http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bio.asp?oid=2879&cf=2879 (December 10, 2001).\n\n\u201cAlana Davis Drawing H.O.R.D.E.s of New Admirers,\u201d SonicNet, http://partners.sonicnet.eom/lp/elektra/singlestory.jhtml?id=500174 (December 10, 2001).\n\nAlana Davis Official Website, http://www.alanadavis.com (December 10, 2001).\n\n\u2014Wendy Kagan"}, {"url": "https://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003180/Alana-Davis.html", "page_content": "Born in 1974 in New York, NY; daughter of Walter Davis, Jr. (a jazz pianist) and Anna Schonfield (a jazz singer).

Billboard magazine described Davis\u2019s sound as \u201crhythmically rich\u201d with \u201cexpressive, honeyed vocals.\u201d Her cover of DiFranco\u2019s \u201c32 Flavors\u201d became a favorite on alternative radio stations, and her album drew a range of listeners with its mix of pop, jazz, and folk sounds. The release of a second album in 2001 called Fortune Cookies proved that Davis had staying power. Straddling the line between popular and alternative rock, she offered music with more emotion and depth than the teen pop ballads in vogue at the time.\n\nBorn and raised in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village, Davis grew up surrounded by music. Her African American father, Walter Davis, Jr., was a respected jazz pianist, and her Irish-Scottish mother, Anna Schonfield, was a jazz singer. A life in music seemed inevitable for Davis. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve avoided going into this direction,\u201d she told David Chiu of UniverCity magazine.\n\nAs a young adult Davis absorbed the R&B of Stevie Wonder, the jazz of Charlie Parker and Clifford Brown, and the folk of female vocalist Joni Mitchell, all of whom she has credited as influences. She studied briefly at Mohawk Valley Community College in upstate New York where, with her love of animals, she considered becoming a veterinarian. In the meantime she learned to play guitar and started writing her own songs. Later she would joke that her only audience at the time was her dog, Homer. Fame was the last thing on her mind when a music-industry talent representative took an interest in her: \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for a record deal,\u201d Davis recalled to SonicNet.com. \u201cI made a demo tape with a friend\u2026 who sent it around to people, and somehow it fell into the hands of Elektra Records. It ended up being lucky.\u201d Recognizing Davis\u2019s potential, the Elektra agent called her in to develop her talent.\n\nDavis then prepared for her debut, polishing her songs and composing new tunes on her guitar. She worked closely with her producer and partner, Ed Tuton, but ultimately her journey was a personal one. \u201cMaking [my first] record was a discovery process for me,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cI went into it thinking I wanted to collaborate and find material, but somewhere along the line I realized that it was going to have to come from me.\u201d While she was creating Blame It on Me, Davis met one of her idols, R&B singer-songwriter Bill Withers, whose hits include \u201cLean on Me\u201d and \u201cAin\u2019t No Sunshine.\u201d Davis credits Withers for steering her down the right path. \u201cHe told me not to waste my chance,\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cTo do something meaningful.\u201d\n\nBlame It on Me was released in 1997 and was hailed by critics as a shining debut.

Yet the biggest hit on the album was Davis\u2019s reworking of Ani DiFranco\u2019s \u201c32 Flavors,\u201d which got much more radio airplay than the original song. Although she was initially supportive of the cover version, DiFranco changed her tune when her fans resented Davis\u2019s success with the song. \u201cIt\u2019s only after [DiFranco\u2019s] fans started reacting that her feelings started to change, and that\u2019s too bad,\u201d Davis told SonicNet.com. \u201c[The cover] has done only good things. I changed the lyrics and stuff but I didn\u2019t take any credit. She\u2019s laughing all the way to the bank.\u201d\n\nAfter her debut release, Davis toured with the muchtouted Lilith Fair and H.O.R.D.E. (Horizons of Rock Developing Everywhere). She performed live with Ben Harper, Blues Traveler, and Ziggy Marley, gaining a reputation as a dynamic live performer with crowd-drawing appeal. Although Davis had some popular singles, her album was not a runaway success. \u201cWhen I came off the road [from touring for Blame], I was lost,\u201d she told Billboard magazine. \u201cI kept waiting for the album to take off, but it never did. During such times, I have to remind myself not to get lost in the despair\u2026. So, my inner voice gets louder and saves me.\u201d\n\nA four-year recording hiatus followed Blame It on Me, leaving fans to wonder where Davis had gone. She spent the time soul-searching, writing introspective songs, and looking for the next step. She came out with a second album, Fortune Cookies, in October of 2001, which she described to Billboard as \u201csimpler and more to the point, a bit more raw and urban.\u201d Fortune Cookies also grew out of her collaboration with producer Ed Tuton. \u201cIt\u2019s very natural working with him,\u201d Davis stated on the Elektra Records website. \u201cHe helped keep the songs pure. He has a wonderful way of helping me get to just what I\u2019m thinking and feeling. That\u2019s important when you\u2019re working with songs that are very personal.\u201d\n\nLooking for a fresh, spontaneous sound, Davis wrote some of the lyrics in the studio. With the song \u201cWhen You Became King,\u201d she drew upon the influence of her longtime female singer-songwriter idol, Joni Mitchell. \u201cIt\u2019s a particular fingerpicking pattern that I learned to copy from [Mitchell\u2019s] records when I learned to play back in college,\u201d Davis said on her website. \u201cIt\u2019s so fun to do. I wrote it without ever really intending that it become a song. I was sort of exercising and playing. It had a nice feel to it.\u201d\n\nFortune Cookies came out during a different time for female vocalists, when the songs of teen pop sensations were gaining more radio airtime than those of groundbreaking, independent artists. Davis\u2019s record company, Elektra, marketed her as an authentic alternative to the overproduced, \u201cmanufactured\u201d sounds glutting the market. Response to her cover of Third Eye Blind\u2019s \u201cI Want You\u201d was positive, and reviewers once again waxed lyrical about the songsmith\u2019s breathy voice and funky rhythms.\n\nBlame It on Me, Elektra/Asylum, 1997.\n\nFortune Cookies, Elektra/Asylum, 2001.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nBillboard, October 3, 2001, p. 14.\n\nOnline\n\n\u201cAlana Davis,\u201d All Music Guide, http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll (December 10, 2001).\n\n\u201cAlana Davis,\u201d UniverCity, http://members/tripod/comralana_davis/interviews/university.html (December 10, 2001).\n\n\u201cAlana Davis Biography,\u201d RollingStone.com, http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bio.asp?oid=2879&cf=2879 (December 10, 2001).\n\n\u201cAlana Davis Drawing H.O.R.D.E.s of New Admirers,\u201d SonicNet, http://partners.sonicnet.eom/lp/elektra/singlestory.jhtml?id=500174 (December 10, 2001).\n\nAlana Davis Official Website, http://www.alanadavis.com (December 10, 2001).\n\n\u2014Wendy Kagan"}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/artist/301303-Alana-Davis", "page_content": "Real Name:\n\nAlana Davis\n\nProfile:\n\nBorn May 6, 1974 in New York City.
