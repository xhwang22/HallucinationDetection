The ads give the Rock, the World Wrestling Federation star, equal billing with Fraser. This is bait-and-switch. To call his appearance a \"cameo\" would be stretching it. He appears briefly at the beginning of the movie, is transmuted into a kind of transparent skeletal wraith and disappears until the end of the film, when he comes back as the dreaded Scorpion King. I am not sure, at the end, if we see the real Rock or merely his face, connected to computer-generated effects (his scorpion is blown up to giant size, which has the unfortunate effect of making him look more like a lobster tail than a scorpion). I continue to believe the Rock has an acting career ahead of him, and after seeing this movie I believe it is still ahead of him.\n\n2. Alex, the kid, adds a lot to the movie by acting just like a kid. I particularly enjoyed it when he was kidnapped by a fearsome adversary of his parents, chained and taken on a long journey, during which he drove his captor crazy by incessantly asking, \"Are we there yet?\"\n\n3. The dialogue \"You have started a chain reaction that could bring about the next Apocalypse\" is fascinating. Apparently we missed the first Apocalypse, which does not speak well for it.\n\n4. I have written before of the ability of movie characters to outrun fireballs. In \"The Mummy Returns,\" there is a more amazing feat. If the rising sun touches little Alex while he is wearing the magical bracelet, he will die (it is written). But Rick, carrying Alex in his arms, is able to outrace the sunrise; we see the line of sunlight moving on the ground right behind them. It is written by Eratosthenes that the Earth is about 25,000 miles around, and since there are 24 hours in a day, Rick was running approximately 1,041 miles an hour.\n\n5. One of the big action sequences involves a battle between two vast armies, which stretch as far as computer-generated effects can see. One army is human. The other army is made of countless creatures named Anubis that look like giant savage dogs that stand upright and run on their hind legs (it is not done well, but one is surprised to find it done at all). These armies clash in bloody swordplay. Each dog-creature, as it is killed, reverts to the desert sand from whence it sprang. Finally all the creatures are destroyed, and we see the victors standing around feeling victorious and wishing that high-fives had been invented. And we notice that not one single member of the victorious army is dead or even wounded. Pathetic, that thousands of years of ancient curses and spells could engender such an incompetent army of dog-sand-creatures."}, {"url": "https://www.looper.com/234931/what-the-cast-of-the-mummy-is-doing-today/", "page_content": "Brendan Fraser plays the adventurous Rick O'Connell, who leads an expedition to Hamunaptra, the city of the dead where the high priest Imhotep's corpse resides.

He was also part of the ensemble cast of the Academy Award-winning film Crash, coincidentally playing another character named Rick, and had an impactful guest role on Scrubs as Ben Sullivan.\n\nFraser was sexually assaulted in 2003, and has discussed the deep depression he endured in the years following. The death of his mother and a bitter divorce added to the pressures upon him, and he felt that he needed to disappear from the public eye. \"I bought into the pressure that comes ... with a professional life that's being molded and shaped and guided and managed,\" Fraser said in a 2018 interview with GQ. \"That requires what they call thick skin ... I just felt I couldn't be a part of it. I didn't feel that I belonged.\"\n\nHappily, Fraser has enjoyed a career rebirth in recent years.

Which will succeed? Loser is mummified on the spot.\n\nSTORY\n\nGenerations after high priest Imhotep ( Arnold Vosloo ) was mummified for having an affair with the Pharaoh\u2019s mistress, a young egyptologist, Evelyn \u201cEvie\u201d Gardner ( Rachel Weisz ), enlists the help of dashing adventurer Rick O\u2019Connell ( Brendan Fraser ) to help lead her to the ancient city of Hamunaptra. However, their quest for knowledge and glory unlocks the monstrous Imhotep, who wants to take over the world with his magic mummy powers out of revenge. An adventure across Egypt ensues, and plenty of mummies are killed in the name of saving the day and remaking a beloved horror classic into an INDIANA JONES-style adventure. That\u2019s a good thing, right? The O\u2019Connells are living a life of tomb raiding, exploring and domestic bliss, but once the story really kicks in it takes similar story elements from the first and goes all crazy with it. This time a resurrected Imhotep says, \u201c [email protected] it, I\u2019ll just use some other guy\u2019s army instead,\u201d leading him to hunt for the Bracelet of Anubus which will lead him to the tomb of the Scorpion King ( Dwayne \u201cStill at this point \u2018The Rock'\u201d Johnson ). The bracelet finds its way into the hands of the O\u2019Connell\u2019s and onto the wrist of their son, who is then kidnapped.

There\u2019s plenty of riding across the scenic desert, digging for treasure, feuding with other hunters, dealing with passionate locals and travailing through tombs. Much of it feels condensed into one location, but the thrills are still packed on and given a practical feel. The mummy henchmen designs still hold up, which is especially amazing given the movie is almost 20 years old. One thing THE MUMMY RETURNS certainly does is up the action and adventure. Whereas the first movie seemed to revolve around more intimate locations, the sequel is given much more room to play, and the breadth of the action scenes (particularly when armies are fighting). We see so much more of the landscape and Sommers sure tried his damnedest to kick up the spectacle. Sure, the VFX look like something ripped out of a PS2 game, but who cares? So much of it is so fun you kind of start to buy into the Johnson-Scorpion baby.\n\nCHARACTER DYNAMICS\n\nWith THE MUMMY director Stephen Sommers wanted to tell a classic adventure story fit with all the thrills and sweeping romance. At the heart of this are the debonair Rick and the intellectual Evie and their budding romance. A classic \u201copposites attract\u201d story with Fraser handling the quips and heroism with vigor and Weisz counter-acting with a tenderness and smarts. There\u2019s also Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay, the leader of the Madji sworn to protect Hamunaptra. He acts as a different kind of foil for the main heroes, one that illuminates the cultural divide of the people who want to harvest Egypt for it\u2019s historical artifacts, and the lifelong residents who want to protect its beauty and majesty (and the evil curses that may or may not be in them). There\u2019s some solid characterization in this adventure flick, and it enriches what could\u2019ve just been a mindless action blockbuster. Like many sequels, the action may be ramped-up but the characters feel somewhat left out. Fraser and Weisz are still good as Rick and Evie, but neither has the same infectious energy and spirit as they did in the first, spending a lot of time looking sullen over their kidnapped son (something to be sad over, no doubt). As well, there are other characters taking up time, like John Hannah as Evie\u2019s brother, and the O\u2019Connell kid (Freddie Boath) who is about as tolerable as any child actor in a blockbuster film. Most of the characters just seem to mesh into the scenario with many of the characteristics that made them interesting in the first film evaporated like the sand.\n\nTHE MUMMY\n\nThe one recurring element of this movie that feels drastically different in the films is that of the villain, Imhotep. We may not see him for a good chunk of this movie, but when we do his presence is heavy and often horrifying. The CGI holds up somewhat, and his fixation on Evie feels very Dracula-esuqe, with the kiss he gives her \u2013 his face still partially mummifed \u2013 remaining one of the film\u2019s more notable moments. He goes through the transition from gnarly creature to human badass with malice, making him a fun villain to watch. In the sequel, however, he feels somewhat neutered. He spends more time confessing his love for Meela/ Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez) and lifting people up with his telekinetic mummy powers. He just doesn\u2019t have the same aggression as he did in the first film. I know it was all probably in the name of exploring a deeper side of the character, but the emo, love-stricken-teen angle is never a good side.\n\nAWARDS, PRAISE & MONEY\n\nThe Mummy"}]}
