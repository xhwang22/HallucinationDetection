The theater events that take place within the department are the means by which students engage with theater performance on the physical, intellectual, and aesthetic levels. It is our hope that you will not only grow as performers but also as artists, thinkers, makers, viewers, researchers, and participants in the whole of the artistic event. The practical focus of the major is to create theater of all kinds using all its art forms. Whether new to theater or seasoned with years of training and skill, all students receive an education that engages them fully. Your focus may be on acting, dance, technical theater/design, performance studies, or some combination of these. Equally important to us is the study of theater and dance performance theory, history, culture, and literature, thereby balancing the practical with the theoretical. Students engage in other upper division electives in stage management, playwriting, directing, choreography, sound design, scenic design, costume design, or lighting design, as well as a myriad of performance opportunities. The theater training and academic courses offered by our department are geared toward the student who is interested in learning about theater and performance from multiple perspectives. As either a major or minor in Theater and Performance Studies, you will study with nationally and internationally known faculty, respected for their scholarly research and for their creative work. Our graduates have gone on to professional careers in all theatrical fields and graduate schools all over the world. Our alumni include professional actors on stage and screen, arts journalists, stunt actors, directors, producers, playwrights, and more. Further departmental opportunities include student-directed theater performances and projects, honors projects, internships in local Bay Area theaters, teaching courses in the department, and invitations to diverse and exciting lectures and performances. Students also have access to world-renowned visiting guest artists through our close relationship with Cal Performances and our extensive network in the field. Declaring the Major Most majors declare after taking 2 of their 4 lower division requirements. For more information on this, see the Major Requirements tab on this page. Honors Program Majors in the Department of Theater and Performance Studies with an overall GPA of 3.3 in the University may, with the approval of the department, apply to complete an honors project. There are two types of honors projects: Written-Only Thesis Written Honors Essay and Production Students should apply through the Undergraduate Academic Advisor and can find more detailed information on the TDPS website. Minor Program The Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies offers a minor in Theater and Performance Studies. For further information regarding the minor requirements, please see the Minor Requirements tab on this page. Transfer students can determine coursework transfers into the minor by bringing unofficial transcripts and course descriptions to the Undergraduate Academic Advisor. A course equivalent to THEATER 10 can transfer from other institutions into the minor. It is rare that another course from a junior college will transfer into the minor because equivalent coursework is seldom found. Since the minor will be from the Department of Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies, it is likely students will do most of their minor coursework in the Department. Declaring the Minor Most minors declare after taking 1 course in the department. For more information on this, see the Minor Requirements tab on this page. Other Programs Offered by TDPS Dance and Performance Studies (Major and Minor) Visit Department Website\n\nMinor Requirements Students who have a strong interest in an area of study outside their major often decide to complete a minor program.

The tracks are described below:\n\nIntegrated Degree Track (referred to as the MA-I.D. track on the application): The MA/Ph.D. track is intended for those planning to continue into a doctoral program and who wish to build careers in University teaching and research. The MA/Ph.D. track emphasizes core area coursework in film and media history, theory and analysis as a preparation and foundation for doctoral study (at UCLA or another institution). This academically rigorous program is designed to move students into doctoral work after one year; however students can extend their studies for up to seven quarters.\n\nSuccessful completion of at least nine courses is necessary to fulfill requirements of the MA/Ph.D. MA degree. Three core courses are required, including a Capstone Seminar, which will produce a substantial research paper as the culminating project for the degree. The remaining six elective courses are elective seminars. Of the six electives, one must be in the area of Media History, one in Cinema and Media Theory, and two must be from outside the Cinema and Media Studies area, but within the Department of Film, Television and Digital Media. These courses allow students to firsthand experience in the practical areas of Film Production, Screenwriting, Producing and Animation.\n\nSelect, highly qualified applicants to the MA/Ph.D. track may be directly admitted to a combined MA/Ph.D. degree at their time of application to the MA/Ph.D. MA program. Students admitted to the combined MA/Ph.D. degree will be funded for five years of study and are guaranteed admission into the doctoral program at UCLA, pending satisfactory completion of the MA\n\nStudents admitted to the MA/Ph.D. track, but who do not qualify for the combined MA/Ph.D. degree at the time of initial application, are invited to apply for admission to Ph.D. program after completing at least one quarter of MA study. Students must adhere to posted Ph.D. application deadlines for internal Ph.D. candidates and must satisfactorily complete requirements of the MA degree prior to commencing doctoral study.\n\nProfessional Track (referred to as the MA-R.P. track on the application): The MA Professional track offers an MA degree for those seeking expertise in critical analysis and research in formal preparation for a range of emerging careers in public and professional fields. The MA Professional track directly responds to the new interdisciplinary and intermedial nature of contemporary film, television and digital media and provides support for those interested in careers in film festivals/media programming, film/media criticism, media archives and media industries research.\n\nStudents in this track are encouraged to enroll in internships and proseminars, which are courses specifically tailored to building the skills necessary for work in the field and are highly encouraged to take advantage of our professional internship opportunities which capitalize on UCLA\u2019s unique geographical position within the film and media industries in Southern California.\n\nSuccessful completion of at least nine courses is necessary to fulfill requirements of the MA Professional MA degree. Three core courses are required, including a Capstone Seminar, which will produce a report on the experience in a Professional internship or a research paper as the culminating project for the degree. The remaining six elective courses are elective seminars. Of the six electives, one must be in the area of Media History, one in Cinema and Media Theory, and two must be from outside the Cinema and Media Studies area, but within the Department of Film, Television and Digital Media. These courses allow students to firsthand experience in the practical areas of Film Production, Screenwriting, Producing and Animation.\n\nThe MA Professional track is aimed primarily at students who do not currently intend to go on for the Ph.D. However, students in the MA Professional program are not prohibited from applying to the Ph.D. While possible to complete the MA Professional track as a one-year degree, students can extend their studies for up to seven quarters.\n\nMEET OUR STUDENTS"}, {"url": "https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/ucla-1315", "page_content": "University of California, Los Angeles is a public institution that was founded in 1919.
