Erickson\n\nOpening Statement: Download Full Image\n\n\u201cStanford is obviously a good football team in all aspects of the game. Offensively, they are very physical and their offensive front is probably as good as I\u2019ve seen in college football in a long time. Their quarterback is the best in the country. Andrew Luck jumps out at you with the way he plays. The way they run the football and play-action pass is very consistent through every game. He has a lot of God-given talent. Their receivers are playing well and they are scoring points against everyone they play. Defensively is where I see the biggest difference from a year ago to today. They are really consistent and physical on defense. They do some different things, as they have a new coordinator. Playing very well in the secondary and a lot of those guys played last year. They have played well against everyone. Oregon scored points on them, but they score points against everyone. They\u2019re a solid football team. They lose one game to Oregon in Eugene and no one has been close to them except USC. They have pretty much dominated every football game this year. It\u2019s a great opportunity for us to play a top-10 team at home and we are excited about that aspect of it.\u201d\n\nOn Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck:\n\n\u201cHe was awfully good coming out of high school. He was raised in a football family with his dad being an NFL quarterback at Houston. When you watch him in high school, I remember he was very well schooled coming out. Jim Harbaugh has done a tremendous job with him too. Jim Harbaugh said he was special from day one and he is exactly right. He\u2019s special. They redshirted him the one-year and he probably could of played. They had a plan for him and he is an exceptional player.\u201d\n\nOn Trevor\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/hankins_trevor00.html\">... Hankins status:\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided yet. I suspended him for one game. In saying that, there is a possibility he will be back, but I haven\u2019t talked to him. Thomas\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/weber_thomas00.html\">Th... Weber is the only option we have right now.\u201d\n\nOn the injury front:\n\n\u201cWe came out okay. We had some injuries, as James\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/brooks_james00.html\">James Brooks had a concussion in the second quarter. Corey\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/adams_corey00.html\">Corey Adams continues to have stinger problems and he didn\u2019t play a lot in the second half. Gerald\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/munns_gerald00.html\">Ge... Munns had a hip pointer. It was a physical football game and we got banged up a little bit. I don\u2019t expect any of those guys to not play on Saturday. Junior\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/onyeali_junior00.html\">... Onyeali had the same problem with his shoulder. He came back into play. He was in and out, so we expect him to be able to play based on what the trainers saw yesterday.\u201d\n\nOn Steven Threet\u2019s body of work:\n\n\u201cPretty much. We have thrown more interceptions then we would have liked. That\u2019s pretty obvious and factual. He\u2019s improved a lot, but unfortunately with what we do offensively if you throw it in the wrong place then you are going to have some issues. He did that in the first half at USC, but he came back and played extremely well in the second half. He is getting better all the time. Once he has a year in the offense, I would say that about any quarterback in what we are doing. The second year is obviously going to be a heck of a lot better. It\u2019s a learning process for him. He made a lot of good plays, but some mistakes. That\u2019s the nature of the position. I like where he\u2019s at and where he is right now as he moves forward with the last few games we play and next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the nature of the quarterback sometimes. They are all very competitive and sometimes they try to make certain things happen when its not there. It\u2019s better to throw it away but that\u2019s the nature of a competitor. That\u2019s happened to him and hopefully he will learn from that and I think he will.\u201d\n\nOn the team\u2019s mood:\n\n\u201cSomber, very somber. When you go on the road against a program like that and you have a chance to win the football game and don\u2019t it\u2019s disheartening. I would be disappointed if they weren\u2019t somber and disappointed in the game. We had some chances and we fought back. We gave ourselves an opportunity at the end of the football game to win it. It\u2019s been the story of our year. We have had those opportunities a number of times. We haven\u2019t won one of those games and hopefully we can do that here shortly. They understand where we are at and what\u2019s left in our season. They have a lot of pride and good leadership. We have a great opportunity this week playing a top-10 team at home. They are disappointed and down like all of us were.\u201d\n\nOn kicking situation:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a guy who has been kicking here for four years. Obviously, he is not having a good year. The situation we have is we are redshirting a kicker that we believe will be our kicker of the future. To take him out of it right now would be insane. We are going to stay with Thomas\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/weber_thomas00.html\">Th... Weber and hopefully he makes some. He\u2019s disappointed and he\u2019s not going to blame anybody. When you change holders it has a little bit of an effect, but he just missed the kick.\u201d\n\nOn decisions to go for two or one:\n\n\u201cWhat we did Saturday was exactly what you needed to do. We don\u2019t just pull it out of our ears. We had to go for two the first time. It was a two possession game when we scored and you have to go for two sometimes. I decided to do that and I would do it again. The other situation, when they blocked the extra point, there was no reason to go for two. I don\u2019t even know what people would be thinking. We scored a touchdown and if we make it we are up five. They go down then they can\u2019t beat us with a field goal. If they go down and score a touchdown then it\u2019s seven and we can come back and kick a field goal to win it. If we don\u2019t then we are kicking to tie the game. We have a chart that tells you what to do, but that\u2019s not always right either. We made the right decisions, it\u2019s just that it was blocked and went for two.\u201d\n\nOn Vontaze Burfict\u2019s personal foul:\n\n\u201cHe just hit a guy late. They both came and hit each other and they threw the flag. It wasn\u2019t like he went looking for somebody to hit. It\u2019s just part of the game and we had four penalties in that football game. We haven\u2019t had anything like that in a long time. Obviously, it hurts and there is no question about it.\u201d\n\nOn the blocking of special teams:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s about accountability. We kick the ball a lot of times in that game and blocked it perfectly every time. Then a guy isn\u2019t accountable on what he\u2019s supposed to do and he flat misses the guy. That\u2019s what happened at Wisconsin too. It\u2019s accountability to do your job all the time regardless if you are playing three plays or seventy plays. You have to be accountable every time the ball is snapped. Obviously, we didn\u2019t block it correctly. It wasn\u2019t any magic thing they did. Our guard went down and dropped his head and the guy came right over the top of him.\u201d\n\nOn Brandon\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/magee_brandon00.html\">B... Magee:\n\n\u201cHe had a tremendous game Saturday. He is getting better and better all the time. He is playing the best we have at linebacker right now. He is making plays. He studies tape and he is having a heck of a year. You can see marked improvement because he spends a lot of time watching tape.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo learn the position, he is getting better and better, and having the opportunity to play all the time is beneficial. He is getting better the more he plays.\u201d\n\nOn Gerell\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/robinson_gerell00.html\"... Robinson:\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s played well this season. It\u2019s the most he\u2019s played so he is getting better all the time. He understands the position and he has made some big plays. He just has to be more consistent and he will as time goes on. He is a big target and we have to use him more.\u201d\n\nJunior quarterback Steven\">http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/threet_steven00.html\">S... Threet\n\nGeneral thoughts on Stanford:\n\n\u201cThey are obviously a very good team Their record shows that. I just started watching them today. They are very disciplined. They play very hard. It will be a great defense.\u201d\n\nThoughts on yourself this season:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if there is one word or on sentence to describe, there have been some good games, and some not so good games. We have had some difficult losses, some very close games we have been in. We, right now, just have to keep improving and keep moving forward.\u201d\n\nOn you personally and this season:\n\n\u201cToo much up and down, I would say. There have even been some good first half, bad second half, bad first half, good second half. Just too much up and down. I just need to play more consistent and help the team more.\u201d\n\nOn best game played this season:\n\n\u201cNot sure. I am not sure there is one game to really pinpoint.\u201d\n\nOn the interception for a touchdown:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t put the team in that situation, any time you throw a pick six, the chances of winning the game are a lot less. It has to be corrected. I can\u2019t keep making that mistake.\u201d\n\nOn the learning to throw it away prospect:\n\n\u201cYes, there are times that I could throw the ball away, but hindsight is usually 20-20. It\u2019s easier to make the decisions after the fact. Even me looking back on it, I question \u2018hey maybe I should have thrown it away\u2019 but I have to work on that. Maybe even in practice, work on that a little bit more, and just get better in that aspect.\u201d\n\nOn consistency in first half as opposed to second half at USC:\n\n\u201cIt was just getting the ball and making the throws. There were some bad throws in the first half on first and second down, that put us in third and long, and then a couple on third down that we did not convert. Anytime you have that you\u2019re not going to get first downs and the defense is going to be on the field and getting tired and it puts them in a bad place.\u201d\n\nOn the running game:\n\n\u201cThe O-line and backs have been doing a great job, and receivers have been blocking downfield so the running game has been really good. It\u2019s something that we have been working on, and will continue to help the offense.\u201d\n\nOn the decision making process at the line of scrimmage being clear cut or not:\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of gray area. A lot of times you hand the ball off and then you\u2019re like, \u2018man I should have thrown that one\u2019. Then there are times you hand it off and get an eight-yard gain and could have thrown it and only got two yards. There is just a lot of gray area and you have to have a feel for it throughout the game. You have to watch the film and try to get a feel for how they are going to stop it. But until you get out on the field, you never really know what they are going to do.\u201d\n\nOn being one of the more challenging aspects of the position in-game:\n\n\u201cYea, its an aspect of it. I would say sometime the decisions are quick, but its part of the deal to run this offense.\u201d\n\nOn if coaches are still sending in two plays, a run and a pass play to choose from based on defense:\n\n\u201cThere are times when they do, but there are times throughout the week we have been game planning and see certain looks and we check to it, so it\u2019s different almost every week.\u201d\n\nOn being 100 percent health wise:\n\n\u201cAt this point, I don\u2019t know if anyone is 100 percent, but I am good to go. Good to play.\u201d\n\nOn the qualities of this team to keep going:\n\n\u201cWe are obviously a competitive bunch, we fight hard every day in practice and continue to improve, and prepare well and get ready to go on Saturday. We battle back from being down this week and were not able to make it happen, but we just have to move on and get ready to go for Stanford.\u201d\n\nOn Gerell Robinson\u2019s play:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done a good job, made a couple of plays for us that were in key situations getting the ball in the end zone, and has continued to improve and continue to work hard all year.\u201d\n\nOn bouncing back this week against a top-10 opponent:\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t sit and think about what could have been this past Saturday or earlier in year. We have a very good team coming in that is going to take all of our effort and all of our preparation.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Steven_Threet", "page_content": "What we do. Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nAmerican football player (born 1989)\n\nSteven Charles Threet (born January 2, 1989) is a former American football quarterback who played for both Michigan and Arizona State. He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010.\n\nHe threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the Class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007.\n\nAfter the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games.\n\nLater that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach, Dennis Erickson, announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.\n\nEarly years\n\nThreet was born in Adrian, Michigan, and graduated from Adrian High School. During his senior year in high school, he accumulated 1,896 passing yards and threw 20 touchdown passes. He also had had 1,528 passing yards and 19 touchdowns as a junior. In all, he threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns in three seasons at Adrian High School.[1]\n\nAs a high school senior, Threet was four-star prospect and the No. 9 quarterback prospect nationally according to Rivals.com.[2] He was also named to The Detroit News Division II All-State first team. In August 2006, Detroit Free Press sports writer Chris Silva wrote that Threet \"has the brains of a Steven Q. Urkel and an arm of a young Peyton Manning. He can audible at the line of scrimmage, like NFL star Peyton Manning, and absorb a playbook faster than Urkel could memorize physics formulas. Threet had Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton clamoring over his smarts and skills.\"[1]\n\nThreet had offers from several major schools, including Wisconsin, Stanford, Illinois, North Carolina State, Indiana, Cincinnati and Georgia Tech.[1][3]\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nThreet committed to Georgia Tech in July 2006 and enrolled early in January 2007.[4][5] His high school coach recalled, \"He fell in love with the recruiters and the position coaches at Georgia Tech.\"[3] Soon after Threet arrived at Georgia Tech, both of the coaches who had recruited him took jobs elsewhere.[3] During spring practice in April 2007, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that \"Threet appeared to take the lead over Calvin Booker for the No. 2 quarterback spot,\" completing 7 of 11 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown while working with the No. 1 offense.[6]\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nIn July 2007 Threet announced he would transfer to the University of Michigan.[7][8] While Lloyd Carr was still head coach at Michigan, he had also recruited five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett. Threet called his former high school coach and left a message saying, \"Coach, I'm going to go back to Michigan, and I'm going to beat [Ryan] Mallett out for that starting job.\"[3] In a July 2007 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Threet explained his decision: \"The biggest thing is that the two coaches that recruited me took jobs at other schools, and that happened after I got there. People have been asking if it was homesickness, or classes were too hard, or if it was all the competition at Tech. It was not any of those at all. I had a 3.76 grade-point my first semester, and the competition (at Michigan) is as good or better.\"[1][9][10]\n\nThreet had been ineligible after his transfer from Georgia Tech. During the 2007 season, the majority of the snaps were taken by senior Chad Henne. However, Henne was sidelined by injury enough that Mallett received a considerable amount of playing time, appearing in 11 games (to Henne's 10) and attempting 141 passes (to Henne's 278). Carr, who had recruited both Mallett, and a year later, Threet, was set to retire as head coach, and Rodriguez was brought in to begin as head coach for the 2008 season. Mallett believed Rodriguez's offense to be unsuitable for a pocket passer, and therefore transferred to Arkansas.[11] That made Michigan's quarterback job was up for grabs. Threet would battle to become the team's starting quarterback along with former walk-on redshirt sophomore, Nick Sheridan, and redshirt sophomore, David Cone. First-year Michigan head coach, Rich Rodriguez, tabbed Sheridan the Michigan starting quarterback to begin the 2008 season. Threet, although, saw action in Michigan's season opener against Utah, entering the game as a substitute and closing the 25\u201310 deficit before eventually losing, 25\u201323. He recorded 132 yards on 14-32 passing along with one touchdown and zero interceptions.[12] Threet was slated for his first career start at Michigan in the following game against Miami (Ohio), although Sheridan would also see playing time. On the first offensive play for Michigan, Threet completed a screen pass to Martavious Odoms that was good for 50 yards. On the fifth play, Threet faked a handoff to Sam McGuffie and ran nine yards for a touchdown.[13] Threet finished with six completions on 13 attempts for 63 yards and no touchdowns, although Michigan evened its season record at 1-1. Threet also started in a 35\u201317 loss against Notre Dame in the third week of the season.[14] According to The Michigan Daily, \"Threet's breakout start\" came on the road against Notre Dame when he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.[15] In its game coverage, the paper reported, \"Redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Threet played with poise, leading the Wolverines to 330 total yards.\"[16]\n\nAfter a bye week before the team's fourth game, Threet was named the starter again and would lead Michigan to their second biggest comeback in school history and the team's biggest win of the season. Michigan trailed #9 Wisconsin 19\u20130 with three minutes left in the third quarter and then scored 27 unanswered points in 13 minutes to take a 27\u201319 lead.[17] After a poor performance in the first half, Threet led the team to 247 yards of total offense and 27 points in the second half. In the third quarter, he led the Wolverines on an 80-yard, 14-play drive ending with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Koger. Not known for his mobility, Threet's most impressive play was a 58-yard run in the fourth quarter that set up Michigan's game-winning touchdown. After the game, Rodriguez said Threet's run \"surprised a lot of people, maybe even himself.\"[18] Quarterback coach Rod Smith said of Threet's second-half performance, \"He's a competitor. He's got some heart. He'll fight you, which is what I want. That's a start, you know what I mean? We'll keep working on the rest.\"[18]\n\nIn the sixth game of the season, Threet started against Toledo, but he was injured and sat out the second half of the game, which Michigan lost 13\u201310.\n\nStarting in a 35\u201321 loss Michigan State, Threet completed 13 of 27 passes for 168 yards and a touchdown pass to go along with a career-high three interceptions.\n\nIn a start against Purdue later in the season, Threet threw two touchdown passes for the second time, including a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum. Michigan scored a season-high 42 points against Purdue, but the defense gave up 48 points in the game.\n\nThreet missed two of the last three games of the season due to a shoulder injury. He did not make the trip to play against Ohio State.[15] However, by the end of the season, The Michigan Daily wrote that \"Threet has stepped up as a capable signal-caller ... And now, fans can take a measure of relief \u2014 Michigan has a quarterback.\"[3]\n\nOne of the low points of the 2008 season for Threet came after the loss to Michigan State when Michigan's offensive coordinator Calvin Magee publicly criticized Threet's performance as \"inconsistent, like it always is.\"[2] Asked later about Magee's comments, Threet said:\n\n\"I guess I feel like that's a difference of philosophy from the previous staff. Granted, coaches do different things to get the most out of their players. Some people close to me were upset that a coach would call me out in front of the media, but you know, in the end it didn't really matter to me. And to be honest, my play in the Michigan State game was inconsistent. Is it right to say that at the press conference after the game? I mean, we had just lost a big rivalry game, so I would chalk most of that up to emotions after a big game like that.\"[19]\n\nThe Michigan Daily's sports editor, Dan Feldman, later questioned the wisdom of Magee's public criticism of the team's starting quarterback.[2] Feldman opined that Threet had been impressive and concluded, \"Whatever happens from here, credit Threet for handling a difficult season with class.\"[2]\n\nThreet would start a total of eight games, four more than Sheridan's season total. The team recorded its worst season ever after posting a 3\u20139 record and stopping the country's longest streak of consecutive bowl appearances at 33. He ended the season with 102 completions on 200 attempts for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns.[4] He also threw seven interceptions.[20] In the off season, Rodriguez would sign quarterbacks Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson on National Signing Day. In February 2009, Threet released a statement saying, \"I have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan. I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\"[15]\n\nAs a 6-foot, 6-inch traditional pocket passer, Threet had not fit into the Michigan offensive scheme under first-year head coach Rodriguez, whose spread offense emphasizes mobile quarterbacks. On announcing his transfer to Arizona State, Threet said:\n\n\"I like the pro-style offense and the coaching staff at Arizona State. My career has been filled with ups and downs and coaching changes aren't easy. I was at Georgia Tech for two weeks when they changed coaches. Michigan had the same coaches for like 30 years and then they change. When Coach [Lloyd] Carr retired I wanted to transfer, but I took Coach [Rich] Rodriguez at his word about the offense. I tried to stick it out. I tried to help Michigan win. But in the end the offense didn't fit me. They have a run first offense at every position. What they want is Pat White and that's not me.\"[20]\n\nArizona State University\n\nTransfer to ASU\n\nIn April 2009 Threet announced his decision to transfer to Arizona State University.[20][21][22] Interviewed by The Michigan Daily, Threet explained his choice of Arizona State over Oregon State: \"The first thing I looked at for any school I was going to go to was the offense they run and the coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel it fits me offensively with the type of offense they run, it's a pro-style offense. I get along very well with the coaching staff, I feel like they will be able to help me get better every day in practice and throughout the season and help me develop.\"[19]\n\nUnder transfer rules Threet was required to sit out the 2009 season, but had two years of eligibility remaining.[20]\n\nIn March 2010 Threet started for the first unit in Arizona State's spring game, though head coach, Dennis Erickson, said that that was only because Threet won a coin flip. At the time, Threet said, \"I'm very excited, but I'm just a competitive person. Anytime I go out to practice, I'm trying to compete with whoever I'm playing against whether its last year on the scout team or this year trying to win the starting job.\"[23]\n\nThroughout August 2010 Threet was in close competition with Brock Osweiler for the starting quarterback position.[24] In an interview with The Arizona Republic, head coach Dennis Erickson also praised Threet's progression: \"Every quarterback I've been around it just takes awhile to get used to what you're hanging your hat on and what we're doing offensively. He's got a quick release, and he has a hell of an arm. He just needs to continue to get more accurate.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback in the Sun Devils opening game against Portland State. In a short statement, Erickson said that Threet \"was the most consistent throughout fall camp.\"[25]\n\n2010 season\n\nIn the season opener for Arizona State, Threet led the team to a 54\u20139 win over Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran with the ball three times for 24 yards and garnered a passer rating of 184.17. His 239 passing yards were the most ever in a debut performance by an Arizona State quarterback.[26]\n\nIn the second game of the 2010 season, Threet led the team to a 41\u201320 win over Northern Arizona. Threet set career highs with 33 completions and 391 passing yards in the game.

High School but opted to transfer to Michigan when the Yellow Jackets changed offensive coordinators. Then the Wolverines changed head coaches and offenses from a pro-style scheme to a spread-option under Rich Rodriguez, which didn't fit the 6-foot-5, 237-pounder's style in the least.\n\nSteven Threet hopes to win the Sun Devils' starting quarterback job. Rick Scuteri/US Presswire\n\nD'oh.\n\nThe Sun Devils also have changed offensive coordinators since Threet arrived, but no matter. He's hopeful that three times -- and programs -- is the charm.\n\n\"I'm comfortable with this offense,\" he said.\n\nThreet, now a junior, and true sophomore Brock Osweiler will be competing this spring to take the reins of an offense that can only get better in large part because it was mostly lousy in 2009, averaging just 18 points per game against BCS conference foes.\n\nOsweiler (6-foot-8, 245 pounds) played in six games and started one -- an ill-fated, blowout loss at Oregon -- completing 43.6 percent of his passes for 249 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions.\n\nThreet started eight games at Michigan in 2008, completing 51 percent of his throws for 1,105 yards with nine touchdowns and seven interceptions. He also rushed for 201 yards and two scores, so he's not a complete stiff in the pocket.\n\nBoth guys have some experience, but neither was anything close to lights out. Both have talent. Both have leadership skills. Both are tall.\n\nAnd it's a straight-up competition with no leader at this point, at least officially. Coach Dennis Erickson said he flipped a coin to decide who would get the first snaps with the No. 1 offense when spring practices started Tuesday. Threet won the toss, by the way.\n\n\"Steven has experience playing in games, and Brock has a lot of physical talent,\" Erickson said. \"So we're going to give them both a fair shot and see what transpires.\"\n\nErickson said he's looking for accuracy and good decision making in the Sun Devils' \"new\" spread offense, which will be run by new coordinator Noel Mazzone.\n\n\"New\" in quotes mostly means that the scheme looks a lot like what Erickson did in the past when his offenses were humming -- spread the field with four receivers and control the game's tempo.\n\n\"The guy who wins the job is the guy who manages what we do offensively,\" Mazzone said. \"You can't be just a flash player and be a good quarterback. The, 'Oh, man, he's got a strong arm -- did you see him throw that one deep?' So what? Can a guy move the football, keep us out of bad situations with down and distance and protect the football?\"\n\nWhile the competition starts even, that's probably not the way many fans see it. Just as Osweiler was the favored new guy last year in his competition with Danny Sullivan, so is Threet presently the one generating the most buzz.\n\nHe certainly seems to have impressed his teammates, particularly defenders who faced him when he ran the scout team last year.\n\n\"There's no limit to how good he can be,\" linebacker Brandon Magee said. \"I'm anxious to see how he'll do. On and off the field, I see him as a leader, someone everybody can look up to.\"\n\nWhat about Osweiler? \"Same thing with Brock,\" Magee said. \"We're going to surprise a lot of people with how good our offense is going to be.\"\n\nSaid safety Clint Floyd: \"When [Threet] was running the scout offense, it was like playing another team. He was giving us good looks.\"\n\nStill, no Sun Devil seemed ready to announce a favorite.\n\n\"It's hard to tell right now,\" receiver Aaron Pflugrad said. \"They're both big, tall guys who can wing it pretty good. I think we'll find out in the spring. Someone is going to rise to the occasion and take the job.\"\n\nThreet is not lacking in confidence. He said his best attribute is his \"intelligence,\" and he said he started to earn his teammates' trust as soon as he arrived from Ann Arbor.\n\n\"They see how I work. I think that really helps,\" he said. \"While they were playing, I was in the weight room every day. I was watching film every day. I didn't need to be because I wasn't preparing for that Saturday, but I was trying to get ready for tomorrow. I never want to get outworked by anyone. That's the attitude I brought with me. That's just who I am.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy to be on the sideline either, watching the team finish 4-8 largely due to an anemic offense.\n\n\"It's tough for me to watch any time,\" he said. \"I'm a very competitive person and want to be out there no matter what the circumstances are. They could have been 12-0 and I still would have wanted to be playing.\"\n\nThere are reasons for cautious optimism that whoever wins the starting job will have a better supporting cast than last year, despite the loss of seven starters, including the top three receivers and leading rusher.\n\nPflugrad, an Oregon transfer, and impressive JC transfer George Bell, will bolster the receiving corps. Speedy Jamal Miles will see action as a runner and receiver. Touted JC transfer Brice Schwab, a 6-foot-7, 345-pound one-time USC commitment who had offers from Florida, Oklahoma, UCLA, among other big-name schools, should offer immediate help for an offensive line that already appears deeper than the previous two seasons. Sophomore running backs Cameron Marshall and James Morrison should be more seasoned.\n\nAnd the defense, as talented as any in the conference, shouldn't need a whole bunch of points to make a lead stick.\n\nStill, that's a lot of unproven variables. That's why most will project another finish in the bottom half of the Pac-10, which could turn the heat up on Erickson, who's now suffered consecutive losing seasons for the first time in his career.\n\nImprovement -- and a return to winning -- likely depends on better play at quarterback.\n\nWhoever ends up winning the job.\n\n\"It's going to be tight,\" Erickson said. \"I don't know if we'll be able to do anything at the end of spring football, unless one of them jumps out and takes it over.\""}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/steven-threet/", "page_content": "Steven Charles Threet (born January 2, 1989) is a former American football quarterback who played for both Michigan and Arizona State. He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010.\n\nHe threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the Class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007.\n\nAfter the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games.\n\nLater that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach, Dennis Erickson, announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.\n\nEarly years\n\nThreet was born in Adrian, Michigan, and graduated from Adrian High School. During his senior year in high school, he accumulated 1,896 passing yards and threw 20 touchdown passes. He also had had 1,528 passing yards and 19 touchdowns as a junior. In all, he threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns in three seasons at Adrian High School.\n\nAs a high school senior, Threet was four-star prospect and the No. 9 quarterback prospect nationally according to Rivals.com. He was also named to The Detroit News Division II All-State first team. In August 2006, Detroit Free Press sports writer Chris Silva wrote that Threet \"has the brains of a Steven Q. Urkel and an arm of a young Peyton Manning. He can audible at the line of scrimmage, like NFL star Peyton Manning, and absorb a playbook faster than Urkel could memorize physics formulas. Threet had Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton clamoring over his smarts and skills.\"\n\nThreet had offers from several major schools, including Wisconsin, Stanford, Illinois, North Carolina State, Indiana, Cincinnati and Georgia Tech.\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nThreet committed to Georgia Tech in July 2006 and enrolled early in January 2007. His high school coach recalled, \"He fell in love with the recruiters and the position coaches at Georgia Tech.\" Soon after Threet arrived at Georgia Tech, both of the coaches who had recruited him took jobs elsewhere. During spring practice in April 2007, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that \"Threet appeared to take the lead over Calvin Booker for the No. 2 quarterback spot,\" completing 7 of 11 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown while working with the No. 1 offense.\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nIn July 2007 Threet announced he would transfer to the University of Michigan. While Lloyd Carr was still head coach at Michigan, he had also recruited five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett. Threet called his former high school coach and left a message saying, \"Coach, I'm going to go back to Michigan, and I'm going to beat [Ryan] Mallett out for that starting job.\" In a July 2007 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Threet explained his decision: \"The biggest thing is that the two coaches that recruited me took jobs at other schools, and that happened after I got there. People have been asking if it was homesickness, or classes were too hard, or if it was all the competition at Tech. It was not any of those at all. I had a 3.76 grade-point my first semester, and the competition (at Michigan) is as good or better.\"\n\nThreet had been ineligible after his transfer from Georgia Tech. During the 2007 season, the majority of the snaps were taken by senior Chad Henne. However, Henne was sidelined by injury enough that Mallett received a considerable amount of playing time, appearing in 11 games (to Henne's 10) and attempting 141 passes (to Henne's 278). Carr, who had recruited both Mallett, and a year later, Threet, was set to retire as head coach, and Rodriguez was brought in to begin as head coach for the 2008 season. Mallett believed Rodriguez's offense to be unsuitable for a pocket passer, and therefore transferred to Arkansas. That made Michigan's quarterback job was up for grabs. Threet would battle to become the team's starting quarterback along with former walk-on redshirt sophomore, Nick Sheridan, and redshirt sophomore, David Cone. First-year Michigan head coach, Rich Rodriguez, tabbed Sheridan the Michigan starting quarterback to begin the 2008 season. Threet, although, saw action in Michigan's season opener against Utah, entering the game as a substitute and closing the 25-10 deficit before eventually losing, 25-23. He recorded 132 yards on 14-32 passing along with one touchdown and zero interceptions. Threet was slated for his first career start at Michigan in the following game against Miami (Ohio), although Sheridan would also see playing time. On the first offensive play for Michigan, Threet completed a screen pass to Martavious Odoms that was good for 50 yards. On the fifth play, Threet faked a handoff to Sam McGuffie and ran nine yards for a touchdown. Threet finished with six completions on 13 attempts for 63 yards and no touchdowns, although Michigan evened its season record at 1-1. Threet also started in a 35\u201317 loss against Notre Dame in the third week of the season. According to The Michigan Daily, \"Threet's breakout start\" came on the road against Notre Dame when he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. In its game coverage, the paper reported, \"Redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Threet played with poise, leading the Wolverines to 330 total yards.\"\n\nAfter a bye week before the team's fourth game, Threet was named the starter again and would lead Michigan to their second biggest comeback in school history and the team's biggest win of the season. Michigan trailed #9 Wisconsin 19\u20130 with three minutes left in the third quarter and then scored 27 unanswered points in 13 minutes to take a 27\u201319 lead. After a poor performance in the first half, Threet led the team to 247 yards of total offense and 27 points in the second half. In the third quarter, he led the Wolverines on an 80-yard, 14-play drive ending with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Koger. Not known for his mobility, Threet's most impressive play was a 58-yard run in the fourth quarter that set up Michigan's game-winning touchdown. After the game, Rodriguez said Threet's run \"surprised a lot of people, maybe even himself.\" Quarterback coach Rod Smith said of Threet's second-half performance, \"He's a competitor. He's got some heart. He'll fight you, which is what I want. That's a start, you know what I mean? We'll keep working on the rest.\"\n\nIn the sixth game of the season, Threet started against Toledo, but he was injured and sat out the second half of the game, which Michigan lost 13\u201310.\n\nStarting in a 35\u201321 loss Michigan State, Threet completed 13 of 27 passes for 168 yards and a touchdown pass to go along with a career-high three interceptions.\n\nIn a start against Purdue later in the season, Threet threw two touchdown passes for the second time, including a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum. Michigan scored a season-high 42 points against Purdue, but the defense gave up 48 points in the game.\n\nThreet missed two of the last three games of the season due to a shoulder injury. He did not make the trip to play against Ohio State. However, by the end of the season, The Michigan Daily wrote that \"Threet has stepped up as a capable signal-caller ... And now, fans can take a measure of relief \u2014 Michigan has a quarterback.\"\n\nOne of the low points of the 2008 season for Threet came after the loss to Michigan State when Michigan's offensive coordinator Calvin Magee publicly criticized Threet's performance as \"inconsistent, like it always is.\" Asked later about Magee's comments, Threet said:\n\n\"I guess I feel like that's a difference of philosophy from the previous staff. Granted, coaches do different things to get the most out of their players. Some people close to me were upset that a coach would call me out in front of the media, but you know, in the end it didn't really matter to me. And to be honest, my play in the Michigan State game was inconsistent. Is it right to say that at the press conference after the game? I mean, we had just lost a big rivalry game, so I would chalk most of that up to emotions after a big game like that.\"\n\nThe Michigan Daily's sports editor, Dan Feldman, later questioned the wisdom of Magee's public criticism of the team's starting quarterback. Feldman opined that Threet had been impressive and concluded, \"Whatever happens from here, credit Threet for handling a difficult season with class.\"\n\nThreet would start a total of eight games, four more than Sheridan's season total. The team recorded its worst season ever after posting a 3-9 record and stopping the country's longest streak of consecutive bowl appearances at 33. He ended the season with 102 completions on 200 attempts for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns. He also threw seven interceptions. In the off season, Rodriguez would sign quarterbacks Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson on National Signing Day. In February 2009, Threet released a statement saying, \"I have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan. I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\"\n\nAs a 6-foot, 6-inch traditional pocket passer, Threet had not fit into the Michigan offensive scheme under first-year head coach Rodriguez, whose spread offense emphasizes mobile quarterbacks. On announcing his transfer to Arizona State, Threet said:\n\n\"I like the pro-style offense and the coaching staff at Arizona State. My career has been filled with ups and downs and coaching changes aren't easy. I was at Georgia Tech for two weeks when they changed coaches. Michigan had the same coaches for like 30 years and then they change. When Coach [Lloyd] Carr retired I wanted to transfer, but I took Coach [Rich] Rodriguez at his word about the offense. I tried to stick it out. I tried to help Michigan win. But in the end the offense didn't fit me. They have a run first offense at every position. What they want is Pat White and that's not me.\"\n\nArizona State University\n\nTransfer to ASU\n\nIn April 2009 Threet announced his decision to transfer to Arizona State University. Interviewed by The Michigan Daily, Threet explained his choice of Arizona State over Oregon State: \"The first thing I looked at for any school I was going to go to was the offense they run and the coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel it fits me offensively with the type of offense they run, it's a pro-style offense. I get along very well with the coaching staff, I feel like they will be able to help me get better every day in practice and throughout the season and help me develop.\"\n\nUnder transfer rules Threet was required to sit out the 2009 season, but had two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nIn March 2010 Threet started for the first unit in Arizona State's spring game, though head coach, Dennis Erickson, said that that was only because Threet won a coin flip. At the time, Threet said, \"I'm very excited, but I'm just a competitive person. Anytime I go out to practice, I'm trying to compete with whoever I'm playing against whether its last year on the scout team or this year trying to win the starting job.\"\n\nThroughout August 2010 Threet was in close competition with Brock Osweiler for the starting quarterback position. In an interview with The Arizona Republic, head coach Dennis Erickson also praised Threet's progression: \"Every quarterback I've been around it just takes awhile to get used to what you're hanging your hat on and what we're doing offensively. He's got a quick release, and he has a hell of an arm. He just needs to continue to get more accurate.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback in the Sun Devils opening game against Portland State. In a short statement, Erickson said that Threet \"was the most consistent throughout fall camp.\"\n\n2010 season\n\nIn the season opener for Arizona State, Threet led the team to a 54-9 win over Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran with the ball three times for 24 yards and garnered a passer rating of 184.17. His 239 passing yards were the most ever in a debut performance by an Arizona State quarterback.\n\nIn the second game of the 2010 season, Threet led the team to a 41-20 win over Northern Arizona. Threet set career highs with 33 completions and 391 passing yards in the game. He also threw three touchdown passes and two interceptions and completed passes to eight different receivers.\n\nThrough the first two games of the 2010 season, Threet completed 47 of 70 passes for a 67% completion rate and five touchdowns.\n\nThe next few games had their ups and downs for Threet, a very close 20-19 loss at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, started a downward spiral for the Sun Devils in 2010. In this game Threet went 21 of 33 for 211 yards with 0 TD and 0 INT. Many believed that the Sun Devils outplayed Wisconsin, Threet played well in the game but it started a trend of what-ifs for the Sun Devils season.\n\nThreet finished the 2010 season with 2,553 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Threet announced his retirement from football due to repeated concussions. After finishing his playing career he became a Student Assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff."}, {"url": "https://collegefootball.nbcsports.com/2011/02/09/threet-might-be-mia-from-sun-devils-spring-practice/", "page_content": "While the competition for Arizona State\u2019s starting quarterback job has no front-runner (winkwink nudgenudge), Steven Threet could find himself lagging way behind in his battle with Brock Osweiler through no fault of his own.\n\nHead coach Dennis Erickson told Ted Miller of ESPN.com\u2018s Pac-10 blog that Threet has still not been medically cleared after suffering three concussions during the 2010 season. The final one knocked him out for the remainder of the year and, just over two months later, leaves his status for spring practice very much up in the air.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll play spring football,\u201d Erickson told Miller.\n\nThreet started the first 11 games as a junior last year before Osweiler took over due to the third head injury suffered early in the UCLA game. Osweiler was very impressive in wins over the Bruins and in-state rival Arizona, leading some to believe that the sophomore had at least a slight advantage over Threet heading into the offseason. And before Threet\u2019s availability was called into question.\n\nOsweiler threw for 647 yards and five touchdowns in those two season-ending wins. Most importantly, he did not throw an interception in his 85 attempts.

Threet was 14 of 21 for 239 yards, 2 TDs and an interception on a pass that was off his receiver's hands.\n\nWhile he liked the tempo of the offense, Threet said he thought the offense could play even faster.

Erickson tabbed Steven Threet, a transfer from Michigan, as his starting quarterback and leader of his new no huddle spread offense.\n\nThrough three games, including one on the road at one of the toughest environments, Steven Threet is the perfect man for the job. That is in no way a hit to back up Brock Osweiler, but Threet has been impressive, not just in terms of numbers, but also with the intangibles that normally go unnoticed.\n\nA field general has been desired in Tempe, Threet has command of this offense, and the ears of his troops on the field. The man in the spotlight has to voice the sentiment of his squad. Following the Wisconsin game, Threet expressed his opinion on the near upset versus the Badgers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in moral victories,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Sun Devils played as good of a game as a team can without winning. That\u2019s the bottom line. ASU still lost, but Threet\u2019s performance was impressive, even without a touchdown to his name. In the past couple seasons, the Sun Devil\u2019s offense was pathetic to watch, and an intense struggle to score to say the least.\n\nLast Saturday against the Wisconsin Badgers, ASU\u2019s formerly anemic offense pushed one of the Big Ten\u2019s best defensive units up and down the field. ASU\u2019s execution made the Badgers look like Portland State\u2019s defense in the season opener. Big plays in the running game and audibles by the Threet at the line of scrimmage gave the Sun Devils the upper hand, but in the end it was not enough.\n\n\u201cI think we have a gem,\u201d Dennis Erickson said in regards to Threet\u2019s performance against Wisconsin.\n\nWith yet another big game for ASU this weekend at Sun Devil Stadium, the job does not get any easier for the \u201cgem.\u201d The Oregon Ducks are the fifth ranked team in the country, and for good reason. Both the Ducks offensive and defensive units are ranked first in the country.\n\nChip Kelly, Oregon\u2019s head coach, has engineered the Ducks\u2019 offense to 189 points in 180 minutes of football. Pretty impressive.\n\nThe Sun Devil defense is going to have a major test, but for the first time this season, Oregon\u2019s defense will be tested. Oregon played Tennessee earlier this year, but the Volunteers were no match for the Duck\u2019s experienced defensive side. Matt Simms, Tennessee quarterback and son of former New York Giant great Phil Simms, was overwhelmed by the speed and effectiveness of Oregon, and could only manage a 51 percent completion percentage.\n\nAgainst a team as good as Oregon, a number that low will not get it done no matter what your last name is.\n\nSteven Threet essentially had his worst game in terms of statistics against Wisconsin, and to describe his effort as anything other than admirable would be silly. Threet completed 64 percent of his passes (21-of-33), for 211 yards and no touchdowns. Sure the touchdowns were not there, but as the story has been, missed opportunities in the end zone were the downfall in Madison.\n\nThreet has a 144.80 QB rating on the year, and a number close to that or better is needed this Saturday night versus a team that will be deeply entrenched in BCS Championship talk come December.\n\nIf the Sun Devils are going to have a shot, the game will be won and lost with the leader at quarterback. Another moral victory will do nothing for the Sun Devils heading into three tough road games. A 2-2 record will be all ASU has to show for their performances.\n\nIt is time to win, and nobody knows that more than the two faces in the spotlight: Dennis Erickson on the sidelines and Steven Threet in the shotgun running the offense. Behind Threet\u2019s arm, the offense will have to provide the fireworks to fight punch for punch with the Ducks.\n\nThere is no doubt that this game is going to be entertaining. Even the ASU brass, Erickson included, has been pushing \u201cSun Devil Nation\u201d to come out and fill Sun Devil Stadium. There is no doubt that the fans will get their money\u2019s worth with these two teams playing. The Ducks can put up the points, and this season ASU has done much of the same. Both defenses are top notch, but ASU has struggled with Oregon\u2019s option in the past.\n\nAlthough the scores have been one-sided recently, with Oregon claiming the last five games. Arizona State has not beaten Oregon since Dirk Koetter and Andrew Walter were the faces of Sun Devil football. In 2002, Walter completed one of the greatest comebacks and single game performances in Pac-10 history.\n\nAgainst the very same Oregon Ducks that ASU will face Saturday night, Walter threw for a school-record 536 yards and four touchdowns, and the Sun Devils rallied from a 21-0 second-quarter deficit to win 45-42. Walter did not just beat the Ducks that day in Autzen, but he managed to accomplish that same feat two more times to end his career perfect against Oregon (3-0).\n\nThreet is in a similar mold as Walter, and could be the major difference from a 4-8 team in 2009, and an upper echelon Pac-10 team in 2010. On Saturday night, the Sun Devils will put their team to the test against the best. Can Threet perform his best against the best?\n\nAfter Saturday\u2019s performance at Wisconsin, Threet is in fact the difference for this year\u2019s ASU team. Threet is the missing puzzle piece from a dismal 2009 team, and a team that was ranked ninth in the preseason poll. Nobody was sure if Threet could do the job, or even keep the job through the season.\n\nThree weeks into the season, ASU was back on the national scene last Saturday but came up short against the number 11 team in the nation. Not too bad for a bottom of barrel Pac-10 team, right?\n\nASU dropped another big game, and a loss is all the maroon and gold have to show for it. However, a similar opportunity is in front of them. This Saturday night at home, versus the Ducks is the perfect stage to prove to the naysayers what type of team Arizona State really is.\n\nPrograms are built on statement games, and ASU has been on the short end of the stick on too many occasions. Steven Threet might just be that performer to make a big-time statement in a big-time game for the Sun Devils."}, {"url": "https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-nov-05-la-sp-1106-usc-arizona-state-20101106-story.html", "page_content": "November used to be USC\u2019s best month, a stretch when the Trojans never lost during former coach Pete Carroll\u2019s first eight seasons. That streak ended in 2009. Lane Kiffin\u2019s Trojans hope to start another against Arizona State, which has not won at the Coliseum since 1999. Staff writer Gary Klein looks at the game\u2019s key issues:\n\nMotivating factors\n\nWith no bowl game to look forward to, and a lost opportunity to upset top-ranked Oregon behind them, the Trojans begin a season-ending five-game stretch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe late kickoff time and the absence of a big-event vibe are expected to result in a smaller crowd at the Coliseum.\n\nUSC players say they remain motivated to play hard and finish the season strong, but a slow start against the Sun Devils would not be a positive indicator.\n\nArizona State needs two victories to guarantee a bowl bid and keep the heat off Coach Dennis Erickson.\n\nThe Sun Devils, with a roster full of Southern Californians, have a 10-game losing streak against the Trojans.\n\nArms race\n\nMatt Barkley\u2019s three-game streak of games without an interception ended when Oregon picked off two of his passes in a 53-32 victory over USC last week.\n\nThe sophomore fell to fourth in the Pacific 10 Conference and 24th nationally in passing efficiency. He has passed for 21 touchdowns, with six interceptions.\n\nLast year against Arizona State, Barkley completed seven passes and USC was held to 258 yards, its lowest output since 2004.\n\nArizona State\u2019s Steven Threet leads the Pac-10 in yards passing, averaging 268 a game. The Michigan transfer is sixth in efficiency, having passed for 14 touchdowns with 13 interceptions.\n\nIn last week\u2019s 42-0 victory over Washington State, Threet completed 26 of 32 passes for 300 yards and three touchdowns without an interception.\n\nNo rush here\n\nKiffin called out his offensive line this week, calling USC\u2019s running game \u201coverrated.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans average 200.5 yards a game, which ranks third in the Pac-10.\n\nSenior Michael Reardon is expected to replace Butch Lewis at left guard. Tailbacks Marc Tyler, Allen Bradford, Dillon Baxter and C.J. Gable appear recovered from injuries that have slowed them the last few weeks.\n\nArizona State is eighth in the conference in rushing. Deantre Lewis, a freshman from Norco, has averaged 57.6 yards a game.\n\nHit and run\n\nUSC\u2019s defense should be buoyed by the return of linebacker Malcolm Smith. There also could be lineup changes if coaches decide to make Chris Galippo the starting middle linebacker and Malcolm Jones a starting safety.\n\nArizona State\u2019s offense is regarded as pedestrian, in pace anyway, when compared to frenetic Oregon, which piled up 599 yards against USC.\n\nThe Trojans must get pressure on the largely immobile Threet and improve their pass defense, which ranks 114th among 120 major college teams.\n\nArizona State\u2019s defense is fast and aggressive \u2014 sometimes overly so. The Sun Devils average a conference-worst eight penalties a game.\n\nLinebackers Vontaze Burfict and Brandon Magee, defensive lineman Junior Onyeali and cornerback Omar Bolden lead a unit that ranks first in the conference and ninth nationally in third-down defense.\n\nSpecial teams\n\nUSC\u2019s Ronald Johnson is the Pac-10 leader in punt returns, averaging 20.2 yards, and Robert Woods is fourth in kickoff returns, averaging 25.4 yards.\n\nJoe Houston has made five of nine field-goal attempts, and Jake Harfman has averaged 42.2 yards a punt.\n\nArizona State\u2019s Thomas Weber has made 10 of 16 field-goal attempts, including a 52-yarder.

He was the starting quarterback for the Arizona State Sun Devils. During the 2010 season Threet completed 208 of 336 passes for 2,553 yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He passed for a career-high 391 yards and three touchdowns against Northern Arizona in September 2010.\n\nHe threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns as a high school player in Adrian, Michigan, and was ranked by Rivals.com as the No. 9 quarterback prospect in the nation in the Class of 2006. Threet committed to Georgia Tech and enrolled early there in January 2007.\n\nAfter the coaches who had recruited him left the program, Threet announced in July 2007 that he was transferring to the University of Michigan under head coach Lloyd Carr. Carr was replaced before the 2008 season by Rich Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2007 season under NCAA transfer rules, the redshirt freshman Threet would go on to start at quarterback in eight of Michigan's 12 games.\n\nLater that same year, Threet transferred to Arizona State University, citing the incompatibility of his playing style as a traditional pro style dropback passer with the spread offense of Rodriguez. After sitting out the 2009 season, Threet had two years of eligibility remaining with Arizona State. On August 30, 2010, Arizona State head coach, Dennis Erickson, announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback for the coming season.\n\nEarly years\n\nThreet was born in Adrian, Michigan, and graduated from Adrian High School. During his senior year in high school, he accumulated 1,896 passing yards and threw 20 touchdown passes. He also had had 1,528 passing yards and 19 touchdowns as a junior. In all, he threw for 4,824 yards and 49 touchdowns in three seasons at Adrian High School.\n\nAs a high school senior, Threet was four-star prospect and the No. 9 quarterback prospect nationally according to Rivals.com. He was also named to The Detroit News Division II All-State first team. In August 2006, Detroit Free Press sports writer Chris Silva wrote that Threet \"has the brains of a Steven Q. Urkel and an arm of a young Peyton Manning. He can audible at the line of scrimmage, like NFL star Peyton Manning, and absorb a playbook faster than Urkel could memorize physics formulas. Threet had Ivy League schools such as Harvard and Princeton clamoring over his smarts and skills.\"\n\nThreet had offers from several major schools, including Wisconsin, Stanford, Illinois, North Carolina State, Indiana, Cincinnati and Georgia Tech.\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nThreet committed to Georgia Tech in July 2006 and enrolled early in January 2007. His high school coach recalled, \"He fell in love with the recruiters and the position coaches at Georgia Tech.\" Soon after Threet arrived at Georgia Tech, both of the coaches who had recruited him took jobs elsewhere. During spring practice in April 2007, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that \"Threet appeared to take the lead over Calvin Booker for the No. 2 quarterback spot,\" completing 7 of 11 passes for 51 yards and a touchdown while working with the No. 1 offense.\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nIn July 2007 Threet announced he would transfer to the University of Michigan. While Lloyd Carr was still head coach at Michigan, he had also recruited five-star quarterback Ryan Mallett. Threet called his former high school coach and left a message saying, \"Coach, I'm going to go back to Michigan, and I'm going to beat [Ryan] Mallett out for that starting job.\" In a July 2007 interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Threet explained his decision: \"The biggest thing is that the two coaches that recruited me took jobs at other schools, and that happened after I got there. People have been asking if it was homesickness, or classes were too hard, or if it was all the competition at Tech. It was not any of those at all. I had a 3.76 grade-point my first semester, and the competition (at Michigan) is as good or better.\"\n\nThreet had been ineligible after his transfer from Georgia Tech. During the 2007 season, the majority of the snaps were taken by senior Chad Henne. However, Henne was sidelined by injury enough that Mallett received a considerable amount of playing time, appearing in 11 games (to Henne's 10) and attempting 141 passes (to Henne's 278). Carr, who had recruited both Mallett, and a year later, Threet, was set to retire as head coach, and Rodriguez was brought in to begin as head coach for the 2008 season. Mallett believed Rodriguez's offense to be unsuitable for a pocket passer, and therefore transferred to Arkansas. That made Michigan's quarterback job was up for grabs. Threet would battle to become the team's starting quarterback along with former walk-on redshirt sophomore, Nick Sheridan, and redshirt sophomore, David Cone. First-year Michigan head coach, Rich Rodriguez, tabbed Sheridan the Michigan starting quarterback to begin the 2008 season. Threet, although, saw action in Michigan's season opener against Utah, entering the game as a substitute and closing the 25-10 deficit before eventually losing, 25-23. He recorded 132 yards on 14-32 passing along with one touchdown and zero interceptions. Threet was slated for his first career start at Michigan in the following game against Miami (Ohio), although Sheridan would also see playing time. On the first offensive play for Michigan, Threet completed a screen pass to Martavious Odoms that was good for 50 yards. On the fifth play, Threet faked a handoff to Sam McGuffie and ran nine yards for a touchdown. Threet finished with six completions on 13 attempts for 63 yards and no touchdowns, although Michigan evened its season record at 1-1. Threet also started in a 35\u201317 loss against Notre Dame in the third week of the season. According to The Michigan Daily, \"Threet's breakout start\" came on the road against Notre Dame when he went 16-of-23 for 175 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. In its game coverage, the paper reported, \"Redshirt freshman quarterback Steven Threet played with poise, leading the Wolverines to 330 total yards.\"\n\nAfter a bye week before the team's fourth game, Threet was named the starter again and would lead Michigan to their second biggest comeback in school history and the team's biggest win of the season. Michigan trailed #9 Wisconsin 19\u20130 with three minutes left in the third quarter and then scored 27 unanswered points in 13 minutes to take a 27\u201319 lead. After a poor performance in the first half, Threet led the team to 247 yards of total offense and 27 points in the second half. In the third quarter, he led the Wolverines on an 80-yard, 14-play drive ending with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Koger. Not known for his mobility, Threet's most impressive play was a 58-yard run in the fourth quarter that set up Michigan's game-winning touchdown. After the game, Rodriguez said Threet's run \"surprised a lot of people, maybe even himself.\" Quarterback coach Rod Smith said of Threet's second-half performance, \"He's a competitor. He's got some heart. He'll fight you, which is what I want. That's a start, you know what I mean? We'll keep working on the rest.\"\n\nIn the sixth game of the season, Threet started against Toledo, but he was injured and sat out the second half of the game, which Michigan lost 13\u201310.\n\nStarting in a 35\u201321 loss Michigan State, Threet completed 13 of 27 passes for 168 yards and a touchdown pass to go along with a career-high three interceptions.\n\nIn a start against Purdue later in the season, Threet threw two touchdown passes for the second time, including a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum. Michigan scored a season-high 42 points against Purdue, but the defense gave up 48 points in the game.\n\nThreet missed two of the last three games of the season due to a shoulder injury. He did not make the trip to play against Ohio State. However, by the end of the season, The Michigan Daily wrote that \"Threet has stepped up as a capable signal-caller ... And now, fans can take a measure of relief \u2014 Michigan has a quarterback.\"\n\nOne of the low points of the 2008 season for Threet came after the loss to Michigan State when Michigan's offensive coordinator Calvin Magee publicly criticized Threet's performance as \"inconsistent, like it always is.\" Asked later about Magee's comments, Threet said:\n\n\"I guess I feel like that's a difference of philosophy from the previous staff. Granted, coaches do different things to get the most out of their players. Some people close to me were upset that a coach would call me out in front of the media, but you know, in the end it didn't really matter to me. And to be honest, my play in the Michigan State game was inconsistent. Is it right to say that at the press conference after the game? I mean, we had just lost a big rivalry game, so I would chalk most of that up to emotions after a big game like that.\"\n\nThe Michigan Daily's sports editor, Dan Feldman, later questioned the wisdom of Magee's public criticism of the team's starting quarterback. Feldman opined that Threet had been impressive and concluded, \"Whatever happens from here, credit Threet for handling a difficult season with class.\"\n\nThreet would start a total of eight games, four more than Sheridan's season total. The team recorded its worst season ever after posting a 3-9 record and stopping the country's longest streak of consecutive bowl appearances at 33. He ended the season with 102 completions on 200 attempts for 1,105 yards and nine touchdowns. He also threw seven interceptions. In the off season, Rodriguez would sign quarterbacks Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson on National Signing Day. In February 2009, Threet released a statement saying, \"I have decided to transfer from the University of Michigan. I have requested and received my release. I do not yet know where I will continue my collegiate career, and have no further comment until that decision is made.\"\n\nAs a 6-foot, 6-inch traditional pocket passer, Threet had not fit into the Michigan offensive scheme under first-year head coach Rodriguez, whose spread offense emphasizes mobile quarterbacks. On announcing his transfer to Arizona State, Threet said:\n\n\"I like the pro-style offense and the coaching staff at Arizona State. My career has been filled with ups and downs and coaching changes aren't easy. I was at Georgia Tech for two weeks when they changed coaches. Michigan had the same coaches for like 30 years and then they change. When Coach [Lloyd] Carr retired I wanted to transfer, but I took Coach [Rich] Rodriguez at his word about the offense. I tried to stick it out. I tried to help Michigan win. But in the end the offense didn't fit me. They have a run first offense at every position. What they want is Pat White and that's not me.\"\n\nTransfer to ASU\n\nIn April 2009 Threet announced his decision to transfer to Arizona State University. Interviewed by The Michigan Daily, Threet explained his choice of Arizona State over Oregon State: \"The first thing I looked at for any school I was going to go to was the offense they run and the coaching staff. Arizona State, I feel it fits me offensively with the type of offense they run, it's a pro-style offense. I get along very well with the coaching staff, I feel like they will be able to help me get better every day in practice and throughout the season and help me develop.\"\n\nUnder transfer rules Threet was required to sit out the 2009 season, but had two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nIn March 2010 Threet started for the first unit in Arizona State's spring game, though head coach, Dennis Erickson, said that that was only because Threet won a coin flip. At the time, Threet said, \"I'm very excited, but I'm just a competitive person. Anytime I go out to practice, I'm trying to compete with whoever I'm playing against whether its last year on the scout team or this year trying to win the starting job.\"\n\nThroughout August 2010 Threet was in close competition with Brock Osweiler for the starting quarterback position. In an interview with The Arizona Republic, head coach Dennis Erickson also praised Threet's progression: \"Every quarterback I've been around it just takes awhile to get used to what you're hanging your hat on and what we're doing offensively. He's got a quick release, and he has a hell of an arm. He just needs to continue to get more accurate.\"\n\nOn August 30, 2010, Erickson announced that Threet would be the starting quarterback in the Sun Devils opening game against Portland State. In a short statement, Erickson said that Threet \"was the most consistent throughout fall camp.\"\n\n2010 season\n\nIn the season opener for Arizona State, Threet led the team to a 54-9 win over Portland State. Threet completed 14 of 21 passes for 239 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran with the ball three times for 24 yards and garnered a passer rating of 184.17. His 239 passing yards were the most ever in a debut performance by an Arizona State quarterback.\n\nIn the second game of the 2010 season, Threet led the team to a 41-20 win over Northern Arizona. Threet set career highs with 33 completions and 391 passing yards in the game. He also threw three touchdown passes and two interceptions and completed passes to eight different receivers.\n\nThrough the first two games of the 2010 season, Threet completed 47 of 70 passes for a 67% completion rate and five touchdowns.\n\nThe next few games had their ups and downs for Threet, a very close 20-19 loss at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, started a downward spiral for the Sun Devils in 2010. In this game Threet went 21 of 33 for 211 yards with 0 TD and 0 INT. Many believed that the Sun Devils outplayed Wisconsin, Threet played well in the game but it started a trend of what-ifs for the Sun Devils season.\n\nThreet finished the 2010 season with 2,553 passing yards, 18 touchdowns and 16 interceptions.\n\nOn February 23, 2011, Threet announced his retirement from football due to repeated concussions. After finishing his playing career he became a Student Assistant on the Arizona State football team's staff."}], "Steven Threet led the team to a 6\u20136 record and a berth in the Insight Bowl in 2009.": [{"url": "https://www.mlive.com/wolverines/football/2008/10/upset_special_toledo_tops_mich.html", "page_content": "A week ago, it was the University of Illinois football team and nationally regarded quarterback Isiah \"Juice\" Williams who beat Michigan.\n\nOn Saturday, it was a bunch of no-names from a slumping Mid-American Conference program who entered Michigan Stadium. Toledo had lost three consecutive games, its defense was surrendering 35.8 points per game and its offense didn't score last week against Ball State.\n\nNone of that mattered against the Wolverines. Seconds after Michigan kicker K.C. Lopata punched a 26-yard field-goal attempt wide left, the Rockets became the first MAC opponent to ever defeat the Wolverines, and the latest team to topple Michigan this season.\n\nWith the 13-10 loss, the Wolverines (2-4) continued their slide toward the school's first losing campaign since 1967 and cast further doubt on their ability to earn a 34th consecutive bowl bid.\n\nTo get there, Michigan needs to finish with at least a 6-6 record, something that seems improbable given Saturday's performance, and the Wolverines' challenging finishing stretch. Starting with No. 6-ranked Penn State in Happy Valley next Saturday and ending at No. 12 Ohio State, the Wolverines will play four of their final six games on the road.\n\n\"We've gotta hang in there, get back to work, but this will hurt for 24 hours for sure,\" Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez said. \"We've gotta make sure it doesn't hurt longer than that because we've got a top 10 team coming up next week.\"\n\nUntil they begin preparing for the Nittany Lions, the Wolverines can wallow in what happened against the Rockets (2-4), who picked Michigan's defense apart with short passes, picked off three Michigan passes and picked up one of the greatest wins in school history, all in front of 107,267 fans.\n\n\"Once you hit that field, it's just football - you've been playing football all your life - and it's a big stadium, but after the third play - after the second play - you don't hear the crown no more,\" Toledo free safety Tyrrell Herbert said. \"It's football. You've got to line up and play no matter how many people your stadium holds. It's about the X's and O's.\"\n\nIt's also about who makes the plays that matter most.\n\nHerbert was one of those Rockets, twice intercepting Michigan passes, including one he returned a school-record 100 yards for the game's first touchdown. With the Wolverines at the Toledo 5-yard line, quarterback Steven Threet threw under pressure toward tight end Kevin Koger in the end zone. Herbert stepped in front of Koger and left everyone behind.\n\n\"I was running, and I looked at the Jumbotron, and I saw a shadow and I was like: 'Please don't let me get caught - don't let me get caught,' \" Herbert said.\n\nThe last player with a chance to catch him was Threet, who didn't make the tackle or last the game. Threet suffered an elbow injury in the first half - which Rodriguez said afterward wasn't serious - and was replaced in the second half by Nick Sheridan.\n\nIt hardly mattered who played quarterback, however. Combined, Threet and Sheridan completed 15 of 27 passes for 120 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions. Threet had the touchdown pass, a 27-yarder to running back Brandon Minor, who suffered a rib injury on the play. Sheridan had two of the interceptions, one by Herbert and the other by his backup, freshman Mark Singer.\n\n\"I need to be more accurate with my passes, and that will eliminate tipped passes and that sort of thing,\" Sheridan said. \"If I was a little more accurate, those things wouldn't pop up.\"\n\nAlthough Michigan's quarterbacks had their troubles, Toledo's Aaron Opelt repeatedly found success with a short, quick passing game. A third-year starter, Opelt threw the ball 50 times without an interception and completed 33, including 20 to wide receiver Nick Moore, who set the school's single-game receptions record.\n\n\"They hadn't shown the spread as much, or thrown it as much,\" Rodriguez said of Toledo's offense. \"They probably watched the film and saw that we had struggled with it.\"\n\nAbout the only Michigan offensive skill position player who didn't struggle was freshman running back Sam McGuffie. He led the Wolverines with 105 rushing yards, 44 receiving yards and had a 29-yard catch that helped set up the field-goal attempt to give Michigan a chance to extend their 24-game winning streak against the MAC.\n\nThe snap appeared fine, Rodriguez said, as did the hold.\n\n\"It's one of those things,\" the coach added. \"It never goes down to one play. There are a lot of plays I'm sure we'd like to have back.\"\n\nJohn Heuser can be reached at jheuser@annarbornews.com or 734-994-6816."}, {"url": "https://www.maizenbrew.com/2010/5/17/1461185/another-look-at-rod-smiths", "page_content": "\n\n\n\nTate Forcier and Denard Robinson in 2009 (Greg Shamus, Getty Images NA)\n\nTaking a closer look at what quarterbacks end up doing under Rod Smith\u2019s direction may provide Michigan fans a better indication of what to expect over the coming years with the Wolverines\u2019 comparatively young quarterback situation that includes sophomores Tate Forcier, Denard Robinson, and true freshman Devin Gardner for the 2010 season.\n\nAfter Rich Rodriguez accepted the job as Michigan head football coach in December 2007, he summarily fired the entire staff of former head coach Lloyd Carr including quarterback coach and star UM recruiter Scot Loeffler. UM running backs coach Fred Jackson was the only Carr assistant that was later rehired. Rodriguez then proceeded to bring in many of his own assistants from West Virginia with him to Michigan, among them offensive coordinator Calvin Magee and quarterbacks coach Rod Smith.\n\nRod Smith played quarterback for Rich Rodriguez at Glenville State\n\nPrior to joining Rodriguez\u2019s staff at West Virginia, Magee and Smith both coached at the University of South Florida in Tampa under then Bulls head coach Jim Leavitt. Magee had been the running game coordinator for the Bulls for 4 years (1997-2000). Rod Smith was the quarterbacks coach from 2001-2004. Smith actually wore two hats as South Florida\u2019s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach from 2005 to 2006. Though Jim Leavitt is no longer the head coach at South Florida, his well-documented disdain for RichRod no doubt stems from Rodriguez\u2019s rather frequent raiding of USF staff over the years, including Magee, Smith and eventually former Bulls\u2019 offensive line coach Greg Frey too.\n\nSouth Florida's Jim Leavitt: \"I should be able to apply and use this scowl in other professions\".\n\nRod Smith played quarterback for Rich Rodriguez at Glenville State in West Virginia. He understand the key concepts and fundamentals of RichRod\u2019s spread option offense and has helped to shape some of the new nuances of quarterback play from his own coaching experience.\n\nOften the first assumption seems to be that when Michigan said goodbye to Scott Loeffler back in 2007, it also said adios to the concept of a effective down field passing game, 400+ passing attempts per year, and 3,000-ish yards through the air.\n\nThe statistics of Rod Smith-coached quarterbacks over the years bear out something quite surprising. During his career Smith has coached quarterbacks to both throw and run - a lot. And 400+ passing attempts and 3,000 yards passing in a season is not so foreign a concept as many would like to believe.\n\nSince 1999 Smith has coached seven different quarterbacks. Only one of them was he fortunate enough to tutor a full 4 years: Marquel Blackwell at USF, 1999-2002. Below are the starting quarterbacks that Rod Smith has coached:\n\nQuarterback Team Year Class Marquel Blackwell, USF, '99 South Florida 1999 Fr. Marquel Blackwell, USF, '00 South Florida 2000 So. Marquel Blackwell, USF, '01 South Florida 2001 Jr. Marquel Blackwell, USF, '02 South Florida 2002 Sr. Ronnie Banks, USF, '03 South Florida 2003 Jr. Pat Julmiste, USF, '04 South Florida 2004 So.

Tate Forcier, UM, '09 Michigan 2009 Fr.\n\nPassing Yards\n\nIf we summarized the average season passing performance statistics of quarterbacks who have played under Rod Smith over these years, they would look something like this:\n\n291 attempts\n\n162 completions (56%)\n\n1,915 yards\n\n13 TDs passing\n\n8 interceptions\n\nAnd no, I don\u2019t see a Tom Brady, Elvis Grbac, John Navarre or Chad Henne in these numbers either. But let\u2019s remember that these are average numbers and from time to time Rod Smith has actually coached a few above-average quarterbacks:\n\nMarquel Blackwell threw for 2,882 yards in 2001 and 2,590 yards in 2002. True freshman Matt Grothe chucked the pigskin around with reckless abandon for 2,576 yards in 2006, and Tate Forcier, an dangerous, though injury-prone true freshman starter at Michigan , had over 2,000 yards passing in his first season.\n\nSouth Florida Bulls Quarterback Marquel Blackwell 1999-2002\n\nSo yeah, not quite 3,000 yards per year a la John Navarre, but those are some pretty decent passing numbers from certain quarterbacks.\n\nPassing Accuracy\n\nOne of things we don\u2019t witness with Rod Smith quarterbacks are major improvements in throwing accuracy. This is somewhat discouraging to see, as is an average completion percentage of 56% among all of Rod Smith\u2019s students. But every quarterback has had different strengths and weaknesses. One must bear in mind that over the last 5 years, Smith has coached 4 different quarterbacks, so there hasn\u2019t been a lot of continuity under his charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we look at completions versus attempts, the smaller gaps are what we want to see. Matt Grothe, Pat White and Tate Forcier are noticeable here with smaller gaps compared to the rather mediocre completion successes of Marquel Blackwell, Ronnie Banks, Pat Julmiste. Steven Threet almost craters off this graph in terms of actual completions, but Threet was not the least accurate thrower that Smith had to cope with.\n\n\n\n\n\nTouchdowns Versus Interceptions\n\nTouchdowns good. Interceptions bad.\n\nFor whatever reason, interceptions have been a disturbing problem with quarterbacks under Rod Smith throughout his coaching career among underclassmen and veteran quarterbacks alike. Notice the regression under quarterback Pat Julmiste (2004-2006) below. We can also see some of the other \"Interception Fiestas\" going on under Marquel Blackwell, freshmen Matt Grothe and Tate Forcier. Between 2003 and 2005 Smith and USF struggled to find consistent play at quarterback.\n\n\n\n\n\nNCAA Passing Efficiency Ratings\n\nSometimes when you accept a new job, you kind of wish you could take some of your good old colleagues and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s with you. At Michigan, Rod Smith had to start from scratch....twice. Building an effective offense with an efficient quarterback takes time.\n\nQuarterback efficiency is nice because it wraps up all of the attributable quarterback statistics into a neat measurement package that takes into consideration passing yardage, completion percentage, touchdowns thrown and interception thrown. The higher the efficiency rating, the better your quarterback is. This is not to say that a highly effective quarterback almost always wins more games. For everyTim Tebow (164.2) or Kellen Moore (161.7) being highly effective at quarterback statistically and winning tons of football games, there's plenty of Jimmy Clausens (161.7) going 6-6, or Terrelle Pryors (128.9) leading Ohio State to another Big Ten conference title and Rose Bowl win, or another Greg McElroy (140.5) leading an Alabama team to another national title.\n\n\n\n\n\nUSF Quarterback Pat Julmiste, Rod Smith's starter in 2004 and 2005 (Photo Scout.com)\n\nStill, from a passing efficiency point of view and historically speaking, Smith's most successful football teams were led by the most effective signal callers. Marquel Blackwell may have played at the quarterback efficiency of a 2009 Adam Weber (Minnesota, 114.7), but the USF was 31-13 over the regular season with him under center. Matt Grothe led USF to a 9-4 season in 2006. Pat White led West Virginia to 10-3 in 2007. Both USF and West Virginia ran spread option style offenses. Conversely, Pat Julmiste's efficiency performance in 2004 correlates nicely with USF's 4-7 finish and 6-6 finish in 2005. For the first time Steven Threet passing efficiency and a 3-9 record somehow start make sense when used together in sentence.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging Nothing Can Also Be A Strategy\n\nOther times when you arrive at the new job the best thing to do is leave things be. Rod Smith replaced Bill Stewart as West Virginia\u2019s quarterback coach in 2007. Before that season began, West Virginia was already pretty excited about the future promise of sophomore Pat White. The result of Smith\u2019s instruction of White is surprising: Fewer quarterback rushing yards, less yards per carry, more throwing attempts, fewer interceptions, but a major decline in overall passing efficiency.\n\nFreshman Pat White 2005 (Under WVU Quarterbacks Coach Bill Stewart)\n\n114 attempts 65 completions (57%) 8 TDs 5 Interceptions 828 Yards 132.4 Efficiency Rating 131 Rushes 952 yards 7.3 YPC 7 TDs\n\nSophomore Pat White 2006 (Under WVU Quarterbacks Coach Bill Stewart)\n\n179 attempts 118 completions (65.9%) 13 TDs 7 Interceptions 1,655 yards 159.7 Efficiency Rating 248 rushes 1,744 yards 7.5 YPC 18 TDs\n\nJunior Pat White 2007 (Under new WVU Quarterbacks Coach Rod Smith)\n\n216 attempts 144 completions (66.7%) 14 TDs 4 Interceptions 151.4 Efficiency Rating 197 rushes 1,335 yards 6.8 YPC 14 TDs\n\nIt's interesting still that Pat Julmiste made Steve Threet look pretty decent, and how a 4-star recruit and true freshman Tate Forcier managed to hit the 128.1 mark in passing efficiency in 2009 while essentially scrambling around for dear life. Wisconsin Scott Tolzien (143.0), Daryl Clark (142.6), Kirk Cousins (142.6), where far more efficient than Forcier. Terrelle Pryor (128.9) and Ricky Stanzi (131.6) where only slightly more effective, yet won more games, including bowls. If young Tate Forcier and Denard Robinson as sophomores ever become comfortable back there, things could get mighty interesting for Rod Smith and Michigan\u2019s upcoming opponents.\n\nRushing Yards\n\nThis is where we must leave the Tom Brady, John Navarre and Chad Henne placards at the door, because there\u2019s no way they enter into the conversation about meaningful quarterback rushing yardage, unless we are enthralled with the study of negative integers. I am not. If we were to summarize the average rushing performance of quarterbacks under Rod Smith over his career, it would look something like this:\n\n112 rushing attempts 494 yards 4 YPC 5 TDs\n\nThat\u2019s it?\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about quarterback rushing statistics under Rod Smith's instruction is just how rare it is for a game-changing, ankle-breaking quarterback to ever emerge. Sure, Marquel Blackwell ran for 771 yards as a sophomore in 2000, but he never came close to repeating that feat during his remaining two seasons of eligibility at USF. Why not? If he had this ability, why not exploit it? Did Smith coach him away from running more?\n\nWith 178 rushing attempts in 2006 we also see how USF true freshman Matt Grothe, who was actually an insolent fullback in a quarterback\u2019s uniform, racked up 802 yards on the ground. The next year at WVU, Pat White's jackrabbit-like elusiveness had him averaging a ridiculous 6.8 yards per carry.\n\nNone of the other quarterbacks coached by Rod Smith stand out very much as dangerous runners. Admittedly most quarterbacks in the country probably won\u2019t don\u2019t stand out much against a Matt Groethe or a Pat White, but some might have expected to find a little more Zak Kustok and Mike Kafka in there somewhere. To find the next great rushing performance at quarterback under Rod Smith would take us back to then senior Pat Julmiste in 2005 with only 483 rushing yards, 4 TDs and a 6-6 record at USF.\n\nQuarterback Team Year Class Rush Att Gained Lost Net Yds/Att TDs Marquel Blackwell USF 1999 Fr. 93 394 268 126 4.2 3 Marquel Blackwell USF 2000 So. 128 771 205 566 6.0 3 Marquel Blackwell USF 2001 Jr. 92 347 106 241 3.8 9 Marquel Blackwell USF 2002 Sr. 89 425 113 312 4.8 5 Ronnie Banks USF 2003 Jr. 40 90 153 -63 2.3 0 Pat Julmiste USF 2004 Jr. 96 354 161 193 3.7 9 Pat Julmiste USF 2005 Sr. 126 483 147 336 3.8 4 Matt Groethe USF 2006 Fr. 178 802 180 622 4.5 9 Pat White USF 2007 Jr. 197 1335 33 1302 6.8 14 Steven Threet Michigan 2008 RS Fr. 76 201 98 103 2.6 2 Tate Forcier Michigan 2009 Fr. 118 240 138 102 2.0 3\n\nRushing Touchdowns\n\nNorthwestern's Zak Kustok, 1999-2001: 22 TDs, 1,293 yards, 3.0 YPC\n\nSo why did he frighten me so?\n\nOne of the things I\u2019ve always thought was extremely cool when watching college football teams running spread offenses \u2013 not mention absolutely terrifying - was when these little quarterbacks like Northwestern\u2019s Zak Kustok, Clemson's Woodrow Dantzler or Texas's Vince Young would go skirting around the end, or just take off on a ridiculous quarterback draw scampering dozens of yards untouched for a first down or six points while lumbering linebackers and NFL-bound defense ends could only look on in disbelief. There have been many Motorola headsets destroyed and plexiglass clipboards snapped in two on the sidelines over the years, but nothing has ripped out the aorta of defensive coordinators across this fine land quite like an opposing quarterback scoring touchdowns with their legs. Because, hey, they\u2019re not supposed to do that.\n\nUSF Quarterback Matt Grothe: A threat with his feet....and his helmet.\n\nRod Smith\u2019s quarterbacks were not all equal when it came to rushing talent, but opposing defenses definitely had to have a strategy in place to neutralize the threat of them scoring getting first downs or rushing for touchdowns.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to make to make too many conclusions as to how good or bad any coach is when he has only one year to work with a given student. The only true specimens of quarterback development under Rod Smith that we can consider so far are Marquel Blackwell and Pat Julmiste. Blackwell was a dangerous runner, a decent passer, but did not display a crescendo of improvement in terms of quarterback efficiency that one would like to see. Matt Groethe and Pat White were rare, but very talented quarterbacks under Smith\u2019s charge, and both continued along similar trajectories of success when Rod Smith stopped coaching them. Pat Julmiste was a dangerous runner, a key scoring weapon, but a less accurate thrower, and actually showed regression in overall quarterback efficiency under Smith\u2019s tutelage. The good news is that in 2010, Smith is finally coaching two talented returning quarterbacks for the first time since 2004 (Pat Julmiste, Ronnie Banks). Of course, the bad news is that the last time Smith was so blessed, his team, USF, experienced its only losing season in school history at 4-7.\n\nForcier, Robinson and Devin Gardner are arguably the most talented trio of students Rod Smith has ever coached at one time. This group is incredibly young. Smith is now guaranteed a strong level of competition that should promote greater improvement and growth each week of practice. And unlike 2008 and 2009 seasons, Rich Rodriguez will no longer be starved of choice as to which completely inexperienced freshman ends up with the keys to his supercharged, V8 powered offense on Saturday afternoons.\n\nMichigan Quarterbacks and 2010 Season Ahead\n\nCertain information has come to light! Like hasn't that occurred to you....man?.....Sir?\n\nFollowing the 2010 spring practice reports, it appears that Denard Robinson has made up some major ground on Tate Forcier and has an excellent chance to break the starting lineup for the opening game against Connecticut on September 4th. The competition will continue to be fierce in August, but Robinson appeared to receive an inordinate amount of praise from Rodriguez and other coaches this time around. Clearly the off-season workouts have yielded dividends, and Denard Robinson is much more familiar and comfortable with where people are going to be on offense and why. His reads appear quicker and more certain than they were only a few months ago. As a passer last season, Denard Robinson was a complete non-factor for Michigan, connecting on only 14 of 31 attempts for 188 yards, 2 TDs and 4 Interceptions. Still, Robinson\u2019s improved throwing form and arm strength has been a pleasant surprise for Michigan coaches this spring.\n\n\n\n\n\nKISS Destroyer Album: \"Flaming Youth Will Set The World on Fire\"\n\nSophomore Denard Robinson, freshman Devin Gardner, sophomore Tate Forcier (Photo Tony Ding, AP)\n\nWhile there remain some big questions for Michigan about replacements at running back this fall, it might be worth remembering just who it was that trailed the tailbacks Brandon Minor and Carlos Brown in rushing yards for the Wolverines last year?\n\nThe answer is Denard Robinson. Robinson\u2019s running ability and speed should not questioned. He racked up 351 yards on a measly 69 carries last fall, a 5.1 yard per carry average and 5 rushing touchdowns.\n\nNow. What college football pundits should be dying to find out now is this:\n\nWhat happens when you take a specimen like Denard Robinson at quarterback in this offense and you suddenly triple those 69 carries in 2010? Does a 2007 Pat White emerge? A 2009 Terrelle Pryor? A 2002 Woodrow Dantzler? A 2008 Juice Williams? How about a 2003 Marquel Blackwell? Have Big Ten defenses seen running quarterbacks before? Sure. And most have done a fairly lousy job of bringing them under control.\n\nTate Forcier still has the best arm and throwing accuracy on the Michigan football team. Another year of playbook study, less urge for improvise, and an improved sense of patience should all help Forcier tremendously in 2010. Michigan\u2019s football team leaned on Forcier so hard in every game last year, it was not a surprise by game 12 to see the youngster so badly beaten and bruised.\n\nMichigan returns seven starters on offense in 2010 including arguably one of the quickest, athletic offense lines Michigan has ever had. This should help Rod Smith\u2019s top students relax a little bit and have some fun out there for a change."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/35150959/trent-dilfer-introduced-uab-coach-lays-bold-vision", "page_content": "Trent Dilfer, the former Super Bowl-winning quarterback and ESPN analyst, was introduced as UAB's head coach on Wednesday, laying out a vision for an era of Blazers football that he said \"many people couldn't possibly imagine.\"\n\nDilfer, who is about to finish his fourth season as coach at Lipscomb Academy in Tennessee, said he knows it's going to be challenging to transition to the college game.

The Athletic reported Tuesday that UAB had targeted Dilfer to be the team\u2019s new coach. Here\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nFormer UAB coach Bill Clark retired in June prior to the start of the 2022 season, citing debilitating back issues.\n\nOffensive coordinator Bryan Vincent assumed the role of interim head coach and led the Blazers to a 6-6 record this year.\n\nDilfer, who won a Super Bowl with Baltimore in 2000, is in his fourth season as coach of Lipscomb Academy.\n\nBackstory\n\nDespite losing three straight after a 4-2 start, UAB clinched a second straight bowl game appearance this past weekend with a win over Louisiana Tech.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore retiring this summer, Clark went 49-26 at UAB over six seasons, never posting a losing record. He led the team to a 6-6 record in 2014, before the university system shut down the program. He stuck around as the program was brought back and took the Blazers to heights never seen before. UAB won Conference USA championships in 2018 and 2020 and became the first team in league history to play in three consecutive conference championship games.\n\nDilfer, 50, has served as the head coach of Lipscomb Academy \u2014 which plays in the state title game Thursday \u2014 since 2019. The one-time Pro Bowler also worked as an NFL analyst for ESPN.\n\nWhat Dilfer brings to UAB\n\nThe former Super Bowl-winning quarterback has remained a huge presence at all levels of football throughout his post-playing career, as he spent a decade at ESPN as an NFL analyst and is the longtime head coach of Elite 11, the nation\u2019s premier high school quarterback competition. He has remained a regular media presence during his time at Lipscomb, offering analysis on many of the star college and pro quarterbacks that he used to coach while at Elite 11.\n\nThe question for UAB is how this will all translate to leading a program at the college level. Dilfer has already reached out to multiple up-and-coming assistant candidates that he is familiar with from his current jobs, including those with experience inside Power 5 programs. \u2014 Fortuna\n\nEvaluating Dilfer\u2019s tenure at Lipscomb\n\nDilfer has had a successful four-year run at Lipscomb, including a 12-0 mark so far this season. Lipscomb faces off against Christ Presbyterian Academy this Thursday morning in the state title game at Chattanooga\u2019s Finley Stadium.\n\nLipscomb\u2019s roster currently has 2023 seniors committed to Liberty (quarterback Hank Brown), Vanderbilt (receiver Junior Sherrill) and Tennessee (receiver Nate Spillman), along with uncommitted three-star prospects in offensive lineman Brandon Solis and linebacker Bryan Longwell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe school also has the top-two in-state players in the 2024 class, both of whom are committed to the Volunteers: linebacker Edwin Spillman and cornerback Kaleb Beasley. \u2014 Fortuna\n\nRequired reading\n\n(Photo: Brett Carlsen / Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://theozone.net/2019/07/what-if-terrelle-pryor-signed-with-rich-rodriguez-michigan/", "page_content": "This is part of a series looking at crucial moments, games, and decisions in Ohio State football history, and how things may have played out if they had gone a different way.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to roll your eyes at the drama surrounding some high-profile college football recruitments. In a team game like football, how much difference can one player really make?\n\nIn the case of Terrelle Pryor, a 5-star quarterback recruit from Jeannette, Pennsylvania in the 2008 class, the answer is a LOT.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s quite possible that Pryor\u2019s decision ultimately cost not one, but two of the nation\u2019s top college football coaches their jobs. So how would history have played out differently if Pryor made a different choice?\n\nWhat happened\n\nPryor strung out his recruitment for weeks past National Signing Day. He finally announced that he would attend Ohio State on March 20, 2008.\n\nThat left new Michigan head coach Rich Rodriguez scrambling. He was trying to bring his spread-based running attack to Ann Arbor to revamp a program that had gone stale.\n\nThe previous season\u2019s Wolverine quarterbacks, Chad Henne and Ryan Mallett, were both practically statues. Henne was already gone to the NFL, and Mallett announced that he was transferring just days after the 2007 season ended.\n\nAt the top of the depth chart for 2008 were Nick Sheridan, who had played in two career games, and Georgia Tech transfer Steven Threet.\n\nThreet left the Yellow Jackets after Paul Johnson arrived and headed to Ann Arbor because he didn\u2019t want to run an option-based offense. Unsurprisingly, he wasn\u2019t a great fit for what Rodriguez wanted to do, either.\n\nBy the time Pryor made his decision, it was too late for Rodriguez to add another quarterback to his 2008 recruiting class. He was forced to roll with Threet and Sheridan.\n\nThe results were awful. Michigan cratered in 2008, finishing 3-9, and burying Rodriguez\u2019s reputation with Michigan boosters in a hole he was never able to dig himself out of.\n\nMeanwhile, down in Columbus, Pryor took over as the starting quarterback following an early-season loss to USC. He led the Buckeyes to the Fiesta Bowl as a true freshman, the Rose Bowl as a sophomore, and the Sugar Bowl as a junior.\n\nBut Pryor was the central figure in the \u201cTatgate\u201d scandal that ultimately cost OSU head coach Jim Tressel his job.\n\nBut what if Pryor picked Michigan instead of Ohio State?\n\nWhat could have happened\n\nPryor\u2019s decision comes down to the Big Ten\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d of OSU, UM, and Penn State. He dismisses PSU as \u201ctoo country\u201d but sees that his mobility makes him a great fit for Rodriguez\u2019s spread offense.\n\n\u201cI want to be the next Pat White,\u201d he declares, citing the West Virginia quarterback who led RichRod\u2019s 2007 team within an upset loss to Pitt of a national championship berth.\n\nPryor is raw, and the pieces around him aren\u2019t a great fit for what Rodriguez wants to do, but he manages to lead the Wolverines to a 6-6 record and a bowl berth.\n\nMeanwhile, the Buckeyes suffer a blowout loss to USC, but rebound to win out including a 24-6 win over Penn State in which Boeckman\u2019s passing ability is enough to give them an outright Big Ten championship.\n\nThe following year, Michigan improves to 8-4, as the lure of playing with a talent like Pryor helps bolster the Wolverines\u2019 recruiting.\n\nThe Buckeyes are forced to start over after Boeckman graduates. They weren\u2019t able to sign a quarterback in 2008 because of Pryor\u2019s late decision, but Tressel brings in 5-star quarterback Tajh Boyd in the 2009 class.\n\nBoyd isn\u2019t ready to start from day one, but with redshirt sophomore Joe Bauserman the only other scholarship quarterback on the roster, he\u2019s thrown into action quickly. The Buckeyes stumble to an 8-4 record, and lose in Ann Arbor.\n\nIn 2011, Pryor leads the Wolverines to a 10-2 record and a Big Ten title before leaving early for the NFL Draft. Rodriguez is savvy enough to not answer any potentially-incriminating emails from his official university account. Boyd shows continued growth during his sophomore season, leading the Buckeyes to a 9-3 record.\n\nRodriguez is awarded a five-year extension, and scores a major recruiting win over the arch-rival Buckeyes by stealing top dual-threat quarterback prospect Braxton Miller out of Dayton.\n\nIn 2012, Boyd leads the undefeated Buckeyes to a national championship win over a Notre Dame team shell-shocked by the Manti Te\u2019o scandal.\n\nThe Ripples\n\nWhen Urban Meyer got the itch to coach again in 2012, jobs like Texas A&M, Penn State, and UCLA were open. How different would the past seven years have looked at any of those spots with Meyer in charge? The Nittany Lions were in the midst of getting fire-bombed by the NCAA, so that\u2019s probably not where he would have gone. Admit it: the idea of Johnny Manziel running Meyer\u2019s offense is kind of intriguing.\n\nWithout Boyd, does Clemson lose patience with Dabo Swinney? He went 9-5 in 2009 and 6-7 in 2010. Without Boyd there, the Tigers may not have taken a leap to 10-4 in 2011 and 11-2 in 2012. If they were still a .500-ish team in those years, maybe Swinney gets fired and Clemson is still a mid-level ACC team.\n\nAnd speaking of Clemson quarterbacks, without Miller in Columbus, Deshaun Watson could easily have ended up a Buckeye instead."}, {"url": "https://apnews.com/article/college-football-nfl-super-bowl-sports-tennessee-ad903f3dc468f4c2d6f0a8f08f017700", "page_content": "FILE - Trent Dilfer talks during ESPN's Monday Night Countdown before an NFL football game between the Chicago Bears and the Philadelphia Eagles, Sept. 19, 2016, in Chicago.

Let\u2019s take a look at a career that has seen Fitzpatrick play in five different divisions, win the AFC Offensive Player of the Week (OPOW) award five times, the NFC OPOW award three times, and the AFC Offensive Player of the Month award once.\n\nTeams Ryan Fitzpatrick has played for\n\nPlaying for over 25% of the NFL (nine teams) at one point in his career, let\u2019s dissect Fitzpatrick\u2019s odyssey before landing with the Washington Football Team.\n\nSt. Louis Rams (2005-2006)\n\nCincinnati Bengals (2007-2008)\n\nBuffalo Bills (2009-2012)\n\nTennessee Titans (2013)\n\nHouston Texans (2014)\n\nNew York Jets (2015-2016)\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (2017-2018)\n\nMiami Dolphins (2019-2020)\n\nWashington Football Team (Present)\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick has played for three of the four AFC East teams\n\nFitzpatrick has been in the NFL for 16 seasons. He has spent half of those seasons in the AFC East. Between the Bills, Jets, and Dolphins, Fitzpatrick has played 109 games in the AFC East.\n\nBuffalo Bills (2009-2012)\n\nFitzpatrick joined the Bills in 2009 on a three-year contract. His first game came on October 18, as he came in to replace the injured starter, Trent Edwards. Fitzpatrick led the Bills to a win in overtime.\n\nFitzpatrick would then start the next two games before returning to a reserve role in Week 10. He was named the starter for Week 11 and started six of the remaining seven games. Returning to a backup role to start the 2010 season, Fitzpatrick was named the starter by the beginning of Week 3. He started every game between Week 3 and 16.\n\nThe 2011 season would see Fitzpatrick start all 16 for the first time in his career. He was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September, culminating in a six-year contract worth $59 million with the Bills. He would once again start all 16 games in 2012 but could only lead the Bills to a combined 12-20 record across two seasons. Despite his six-year contract, Fitzpatrick was released following the firing of Chan Gailey.\n\nDuring his Buffalo career, Fitzpatrick appeared in 55 games, starting 53. He completed 59.8% of his passes for 11,654 yards, 80 touchdowns, and 64 interceptions. He finished with a 20-33 record as the Bills\u2019 starting QB.\n\nNew York Jets (2015-2016)\n\nAfter spending two seasons in the AFC South, Fitzpatrick would return to the AFC East with the Jets. He arrived in New York via trade and was named the starter after Geno Smith suffered a broken jaw in a locker room incident.\n\nFitzpatrick would start all 16 games for the Jets in 2015, leading the team to a 10-6 record. While this was Fitzpatrick\u2019s best record as a starter in his career, it was not enough to earn him a playoff berth. The Jets lost out in the East to the New England Patriots, who finished 12-4. They also missed out on a Wild Card berth to the Steelers, who had a better win percentage in common games.\n\nAfter testing free agency, Fitzpatrick returned to the Jets on a one-year contract for the 2016 season. He began the season as the starter but was benched in Week 6. After playing in a backup role in Week 7, Fitzpatrick would start five of the Jets\u2019 remaining nine games in the 2016 season.\n\nFitzpatrick subsequently headed to the Buccaneers as a free agent the following offseason. He played in 30 games with the Jets, starting 27, with a 13-14 record. Fitzpatrick completed 58.3% of his passes for 6,615 yards, with 43 touchdowns and 32 interceptions.\n\nMiami Dolphins (2019-2020)\n\nTwo seasons after leaving the AFC East, Fitzpatrick was back \u2014 this time in Florida with the Dolphins. He beat out Josh Rosen as the Week 1 starter. Fitzpatrick started the first two games \u2014 the Dolphins were defeated by a combined score of 102-10. Rosen was named the starter for Week 3 and remained as such until Week 6. At that point, Fitzpatrick replaced Rosen and would start the remainder of the season.\n\nThe start of the 2020 season saw Fitzpatrick named the starter ahead of Tua Tagovailoa, who was recovering from injury. Following the team\u2019s bye in Week 7, however, Tua was named the starter. Fitzpatrick started one more game that season (Week 12) but came in to replace Tua in Weeks 11 and 16.\n\nIn his two seasons in Miami, Fitzpatrick would play in 24 games, starting 20 with a 9-11 record. During that time, he completed 64.2% of his passes for 5,620 yards, 33 touchdowns, and 21 interceptions.\n\nFitzpatrick has played for another five NFL franchises in his career\n\nWhile he has spent half of his NFL career in the AFC East, Fitzpatrick has played for a further five teams in the other eight years.\n\nSt. Louis Rams (2005-2006)\n\nAfter being named the Ivy League Player of the Year in 2004 and leading Harvard to the Ivy League Championship Game, Fitzpatrick headed for the 2005 NFL Draft. In the seventh round of the draft, the Rams selected Fitzpatrick and signed him to a three-year contract, making them the first of his nine teams.\n\nFitzpatrick\u2019s debut came that November against the Houston Texans. He made an instant impact in that game, leading the team back from 24-3 to win 33-27 in overtime. That performance earned Fitzpatrick the NFC Offensive Player of the Week and a starting role for the following three weeks. In Week 15, he was replaced at halftime and did not play in the final two weeks.\n\nIn the 2016 season, Fitzpatrick played in only the season finale in relief of Marc Bulger. He was traded during the following offseason. Across his two seasons with the Rams, Fitzpatrick played in five games, starting three (losing all three). He completed just 56.3% of his passes for 777 yards, 4 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions.\n\nCincinnati Bengals (2007-2008)\n\nThe opportunity for Fitzpatrick to start with the Bengals came in 2008 when Carson Palmer suffered an elbow injury. He started 12 games, leading the Bengals to a 4-7-1 record. During the season, Fitzpatrick completed 59.4% of his passes for 1,905 yards, with 8 touchdowns and 9 interceptions. He finished third among QBs in terms of rushing yards with 304.\n\nTennessee Titans (2013) and Houston Texans (2014)\n\nFollowing his release from the Bills, Fitzpatrick made the move to the AFC South in 2013. He took over for Jake Locker in Week 4, before starting nine of the remaining 11 games of the Titans\u2019 season. However, he could only manage a 3-6 record, which was salvaged by a 2-0 finish to the season. After completing 62% of his passes for 2,454 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, Fitzpatrick was released by the Titans.\n\nThe move to Houston saw Fitzpatrick become the starter to open the season. He started the first nine games before being replaced by Ryan Mallett for the next two. In Week 13, he returned to the starting role, starting another three games before fracturing his tibia. Fitzpatrick finished with a 6-6 record with the Texans, completing 63.1% of his passes for 2,483 yards, 17 touchdowns, and 8 interceptions.\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers (2017-2018)\n\nTampa Bay became Fitzpatrick\u2019s eighth team when they signed him as a veteran backup for Jameis Winston. He made a total of 14 appearances, including 10 starts.\n\nFitzpatrick\u2019s best stretch came at the beginning of the 2018 season. He earned the NFC Offensive Player of the Year award in both Weeks 1 and 2. He then threw for over 400 yards against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 3, becoming the first player to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games.\n\nAfter struggling in Week 4, Fitzpatrick lost his starting role. He regained that role in Week 9, only to lose it again in Week 11. That would be Fitzpatrick\u2019s final game for the Buccaneers. He finished his Buccaneers career with a 63.6% completion rate with 3,469 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.\n\nBen Rolfe is a Senior Managing Editor at Pro Football Network and is also a member of the Fantasy Sports Writers Association (FSWA).
