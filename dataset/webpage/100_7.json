{"Tathagata Satpathy has also been a vocal critic of the government's handling of the Maoist insurgency in Odisha.": [{"url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/political-pulse/tathagata-satpathy-interview-cong-defamation-rahul-gandhi-8542406/", "page_content": "With Congress leader Rahul Gandhi convicted of criminal defamation last month, and subsequently disqualified as Lok Sabha MP, there have been calls for a review of the criminal defamation legislation in India. It is not the first time.\n\nIn 2016, then Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Tathagata Satpathy moved a Private Member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha to decriminalise defamation \u2014 the Protection of Speech and Reputation Bill (commonly known as the \u201cSpeech Bill\u201d). Satpathy, who is now the editor of Odia daily Dharitri, speaks to The Indian Express about what prompted him to introduce the Bill, its features, the response of other parties, and the effect criminal defamation has in today\u2019s political climate. Excerpts:\n\nAs an editor, I had about 87 defamation cases filed against me. In Odisha, you have a law that women don\u2019t have to deposit money if they want to file a defamation case. Normally, if you want to file a defamation case you have to deposit a certain percentage of what you claim in court. What happens if you level an allegation or publish a story against the police officials and bureaucrats in the newspapers is that they will get their wives or mothers or sisters to file a case against you. Even if you have enough evidence against them, they will file. Eventually, you will get cleared \u2014 in my case, I won all the cases if not in the lower court, then in the higher court. But it\u2019s harassment.\n\nSo, partly, my Bill was driven by my personal experiences. Because two proceedings, civil and criminal, for the same offence do not seem justified to me. If you look at the global picture, the criminal aspect of the defamation case is not there in any democratic country. The last one I know that had it was Australia but they also removed it a few years ago. In most countries, it\u2019s only the civil part. My simple counter was how can we prosecute twice for the same offence?\n\nI sought the help of lawyers and others, including journalists. Apar Gupta was one of the lawyers who played a key role in drafting that Bill. I may have read the Bill at least 100 times before I went ahead with it. Apar then suggested it would be good if we could put it up for public review, which we did. We had a website \u2014 speechbill.in \u2014 and sought people\u2019s views also. We received a lot of feedback.\n\nWhat were the features of the Bill?\n\nThe main feature of the Bill was that it decriminalised defamation and treated it as a civil offence. It had provisions to curb the chilling effects of criminal defamation and had provisions to prevent damage to reputations. It had quantification of damages for defamation, fixed the maximum amount of damages, and barred governments and institutions exercising government or statutory functions from filing defamation suits.\n\nHow relevant is it in the wake of recent political events?\n\nI did not foresee such an event. I always thought that it is very wrong. Today, everyone seems to have woken up. At the time, the Congress did not support my Bill, no one backed me. But, I wanted to put it on record for posterity at least. I would not say it was a watertight Bill. It needed improvement. But I would like MPs to take it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing an editor, and an active politician not so long ago, what do you think of the position that the right to reputation is no less important a right than the right to freedom of speech?\n\nRight to reputation is a debatable point and that can never ever infringe on freedom of speech or freedom of expression. A statement or a post or a tweet can be said to be hurting someone\u2019s sense and sensibilities. We are seeing it across the country. Then, it is up to them, not to the defendant, to prove how their reputation has been hurt. It\u2019s in the legal process also that during the cross-examination the complainant has to prove how \u2026 but all they can do is to find one or two witnesses in their neighbourhood to say \u2018yes, we thought bad of her or him because of the remark\u2019.\n\nThere are instances of people in power using the defamation law. Do you think it is being used to silence people?\n\nYes, people in power become super touchy. Some people say vulgar things but defend those by claiming freedom of speech. When someone calls me leftist or presstitute or sickular, I get offended. I am very badly hurt because I do not consider myself as someone selling his pen, I consider myself to be neither secular nor Leftist. Yes, I consider myself a liberal, I agree. I was in the House (Lok Sabha) when a Minister of State uttered the word \u2018Presstitute\u2019 on the floor of the House. As an editor and a working journalist, I was hurt. We knew that nothing will come of it. Yes, the same people use defamation clauses against others.\n\nAnother thing is that our lower judiciary is not trained to handle so many issues that come up with something like defamation. They are not normal criminal cases but are hypothetical ones. Our lower judiciary is not equipped to handle them. We talk of judicial reforms and the law minister is constantly talking against the collegium. But they are talking about the Supreme Court that they are dealing with every day. But the common Indian does not get to reach the Supreme Court. They are penalised, prosecuted, sentenced, jailed, given life terms, and the appeals take years. Some die in prisons. I would say 99 per cent of our population even. The high courts seem very high. People can afford to go to only the lower courts. I do not think the lower courts can sit in judgment on such delicate issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you come across instances of defamation clauses being used against political rivals?\n\nI have never experienced (it), at least not in Odisha. But, of course, it comes up against the media. Of late, it has been happening. They are managing to corner opponents that way. The number of defamation cases was much lower 15-20 years back. Either people were gentler or they were not so touchy. If you start taking one line out of a speech, it can work any which way.\n\nYou are an editor. Does the new trend make you think twice before criticising someone powerful even if it\u2019s based on fact? Do you think there is increasing fear among citizens about criticising someone or exposing corruption?\n\nYes, people across India today are much more careful about what they say, especially about politics and politicians. Also about big business. All the powerful people.\n\nYou too?\n\nI am a don\u2019t-care-a-hoot kind of person but I refrain from being abusive. I speak what I like and also write what I think is correct. Also, must admit I have personally not felt fear or threatened, as yet."}, {"url": "https://www.deccanherald.com/national/tathagata-satpathy-quits-721624.html", "page_content": "Senior BJD MP Tathagata Satpathy on Tuesday announced quitting politics to return to full-time journalism even as he emphasised that he has no \"ill-will\" against Odisha Chief Minister and party chief Naveen Patnaik.\n\nSatpathy, who represents Dhenkanal in Odisha and edits Odia newspaper 'Dharitri' and English daily 'Orissa Post', will not be contesting again as he wanted to focus more on the newspapers he edits and spend more time with family.\n\n\"There is no ill-will against the BJD or the party chief.

A senior Biju Janata Dal leader and chief whip of the party in the House, 61-year-old Satpathy has the knack of saying things in such a way that he is heard by his critics and admirers alike.\n\nIn the recently concluded monsoon session, Satpathy, who is also the editor of the widely circulated Oriya daily Dharitri and the English daily Orissa Post, took a dig at the \u2018cow worshipers\u2019 in the ruling side, telling them plainly that they should learn to recognise their mother as the Jersey variety found in abundance at present cannot be called the \u201choly Indian cow\u201d.\n\nIn an interview with The Wire, he laments that those who came to power in New Delhi by using the vehicle of democracy are now attempting to break it down. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to maintain the vehicle that has brought them from Ayodhya to Delhi.\u201d\n\nA fourth-term Lok Sabha MP, Satpathy says he does not buy that there is no alternative to Narendra Modi in 2019. He hopes for the arrival of the Indian spring in politics and is confident of the re-emergence of the regional parties. He claims that even their joining forces could not be ruled out though the picture at present is \u201chazy\u201d.\n\n\u201c2019 is an open field. What can be predicted is not worth predicting. What cannot be predicted is most likely what seems impossible now.\u201d\n\nExcerpts:\n\nHow do you see the scenario in 2019 Lok Sabha polls as BJP looks unstoppable since the opposition parties have failed to get their act together so far?\n\nA lot of people say BJP may go in for snap polls. I disagree somewhat with this assessment. The people leading BJP are well aware that polls before time create an atmosphere not conducive to those who summon the polls. We saw this in 2004 and many times in the past 70 years.\n\nSo 2019 is an open field. What can be predicted is not worth predicting. What cannot be predicted is most likely what seems impossible now.\n\nBut, there is no opposition unity now?\n\nIf you remember, in 1977 Indira Gandhi seemed the strongest, the most powerful, and obviously because of the Emergency not worth messing with. And since there were no opposition leaders worth their salt at that time, the outcome was considered predictable by many.\n\nHowever, one thing I remember was that an average Indian was praising Indira Gandhi and keeping quiet when asked about others. I sense a similar situation of bhakts praising their leader today, although the bhakts are also becoming somewhat feeble.\n\nBut BJP chief Amit Shah is being hailed as \u2018Chanakya\u2019 after the party\u2019s landslide in Uttar Pradesh, suggesting thereby that New Delhi will be retained via Lucknow again.\n\nI will not be the competent person to comment on any individual. But then in the same breath one must admit that Uttar Pradesh over the past few decades had a very muddled and tumultuous politics. People of UP probably wanted to check out an alternative and they did what they did. To take credit for people\u2019s decision is like a windsock that blows in the same direction that wind blows.\n\nAt the end of three years of Narendra Modi dispensation, how do you assess the NDA\u2019s achievements and failures? Would you see glass as half full?\n\nAfter three years, the BJP government looks to have fully emptied the glass. I would give only the example of Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana, which was touted as the pet project of the prime minister.\n\nToday, most of the BJP MPs have refrained from choosing one particular village in their respective constituencies. Similarly, one has to look at Swachh Bharat programme for which all of us are paying through our nose in form of hefty cess in every single transaction. Instead of making people aware about cleanliness, if you start taking money, then it becomes your sole responsibility to ensure cleanliness everywhere. If you want to see how effective the Swachh Bharat programme is, all one needs to do is go in and around New Delhi railway stations.\n\nBut the government claims that it has made a surgical strike on corruption through demonetisation and ushering in GST.\n\nI have yet to see how demonetisation has helped the economy. GST is not unique to India, but what is unique is multiple layers of taxes. That \u2018one nation, one tax\u2019 slogan is obviously a big sham. Today\u2019s reports that the industrial output has dipped to 2% as against 7.1% in same April-June quarter in 2016 should be an indicator of how helpful demonetisation and GST have been for our people.\n\nBJP is suggesting that when Narendra Modi has to only contend with Rahul Gandhi, then there is no challenge to it in 2019. Where is the option they ask. Your comments.\n\nPeople do not always look for a single individual when they want to escape from the yoke of one individual.\n\nIt seems you do not see much relevance of Congress in the next elections.\n\nI see re-emergence of regional parties which may be the only path out of a non-democratic attitude at the Centre. So it is not necessarily an alternative individual or the Congress that can be a threat. It could be a group of people willing to lead a pro-democracy movement. Let us think of an Indian spring.\n\nBut regional parties are getting decimated as we saw in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, there is politics of intimidation by Modi-Shah against them.\n\nJust that some regional parties had become complacent and they had to take a beating. I am sure all of them including SP (Samajwadi Party) and BSP (Bahujan Samaj Party) will tie their shoe laces and will be fighting fit in the very near future. Even joining of regional forces may not be ruled out at this moment even though the picture may seem a bit hazy today.\n\nBut you have seen that the Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has developed cold feet.\n\nNot every regional party is like Nitish Kumar and his JD(U). It is fair to change political partners but never when you are elected in one partnership and you change mid-course.\n\nIf Nitish Kumar would have called for elections and gone with BJP that would have been a sign of a true democrat. Today it becomes easy to label such actions with a negative colour.\n\nSunil Gatade is a senior journalist.\n\nNote: This article was erroneously credited to M.K. Venu earlier.

The present law actually mandates a system wherein people can be jailed for speaking their minds. I have decided to move a private member's bill in the winter session (in November-December),\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe MP from Dhenkanal in Odisha maintained that lately he has been also provoked by \"two contradictory judgements\" on defamation laws.\n\n\n\n\"In one case, the Supreme Court, on the request of petitioners Subramanian Swamy, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, considered the validity of the existing law and said it is constitutional. But in another case, the apex court counselled Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa to understand that public figures must face criticism. I am looking for more clarity,\" Satpathy said.\n\n\n\nIn its ruling in May, the apex court had noted that \"the right to freedom of speech and expression is not an absolute right\" and that freedom of expression has to be \"balanced with the other person's right to reputation\", he said, but in August it said differently on Jayalalithaa's petition, pointing out that the criminal defamation law should not be misused.\n\n\n\nMaintaining that the existing laws have been \"generally abused\", he said that, in his bill, he is trying to focus on three basic features: \"Remove criminality, protect reputation and codify and strengthen civil proceedings as the lower courts, in the absence of effective guidelines, create problems for subordinate judges to process cases.\"\n\n\n\n\"There are so many inherent contradictory issues in the defamation law. One can file both criminal and civil suits. The defamation amount is left to anybody's wild imagination. One popular news magazine was sued for Rs 500 crore. Is that magazine worth that huge amount?\"\n\n\n\nSatpathy, who has a penchant for taking as a compliment words like \"maverick\" hurled at him, said: \"As editor and publisher of my newspaper 'Dharitri', after a five-year defamation case in court, I was fined Rs 50,000 and jailed for six months.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether his decision to push the bill would seek to protect the media as, on a number of occasions, defamation cases are filed against journalists and media organisations, Satpathy said, albeit in a lighter vein: \"It is just the opposite. Actually, I want to protect the rich and my politician friends from you all bad journalists.\"\n\n\n\nSatpathy maintained that on the broader level, he looks at the issue of need for changes in the defamation law from a social perspective, saying: \"If my suggestions are accepted and changes are brought about, this will go a long way in strengthening the judicial process vis-a-vis freedom of expression.\"\n\n\n\n\"So far the reforms we talk about are confined to the economic paradigm only. But we must note, we live in a society and not in an economy per se. So, unless we bring social reforms, we cannot have a sound legal system which would ultimately make economic reforms sustainable,\" he contended.\n\n\n\nHe said the initial response on his move from members of parliament has been overwhelming. \"I have got good response and MPs have assured cooperation. I have also spoken to (Union Law Minister) Ravi Shankar Prasad and (BJP MP) Subaramanian Swamy, who happens to be at the receiving end of defamation laws,\" he said.\n\n\n\n(Nirendra Dev can be contacted at nirendra.n@ians.in)\n\n"}, {"url": "https://wiki.alquds.edu/?query=Tathagata_Satpathy", "page_content": "Indian politician\n\nTathagata Satpathy (born 1 April 1956) was a member of the 12th, 14th, 15th and 16th Lok Sabha of India. He represented the Dhenkanal constituency of Odisha, and was re-elected for the fourth time in 2014. He was a member of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) political party, and the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha. He took voluntary retirement from politics in March 2019. He is not an active politician ever since.\n\nLife and work [ edit ]\n\nTathagata Satpathy is the second son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy and Devendra Satpathy.[1][2] He is the owner and editor of the daily Odia newspaper, Dharitri, and the English daily, Orissa Post.[3][2]\n\nTathagata educated at St. Columba's School in New Delhi and Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education, Pondicherry, he has studied Philosophy, English and French. He had done his mother language, Oriya, by self study.\n\nTathagata entered active politics in the mid 70s as a teenager opposing the Emergency clamped by the Indian National Congress (INC).[4].\n\nWhile both his parents were long time Congress members, Tathagata has been opposed to that political party since before his career in electoral politics began early.\n\nHe joined active politics in the late 1980s when Sri Biju Patnaik took him into the Janata Party and he got elected to the Odisha Legislative Assembly and became an MLA in 1990. While his party kept changing its name from Janata Party to Janata Dal and later Biju Janata Dal, but he never changed his party.\n\nHe went on to become a Four term Member of Parliament till 2019 by winning the Dhenkanal-Angul Lok Sabha seat in 1998, 2004, 2009 and 2014 general elections.\n\nHis nephew Suparno Satpathy had unsuccessfully contested him in 2014 for the office of MP Lok Sabha, Dhenkanal.\n\nIn March 2015, Tathagata Satpathy became the first Indian Member of Parliament to hold an official \"Ask Me Anything\" session on the content-sharing website Reddit.[3] In April, Satpathy came forward in support of net neutrality, after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) come out with a consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services.[5] In December 2015, Satpathy had supported a bill to decriminalise homosexuality. The bill was introduced by INC leader Shashi Tharoor. But, it was defeated with 71 against, 1 abstaining and 24 in favour.[6]\n\nViews and opinions [ edit ]\n\nOn net neutrality [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2014, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released a formal consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services and whether telecom operators should be allowed to charge separately for some messaging apps.[7] Soon afterwards, Tathagata Satpathy wrote an open letter to TRAI stating his support for net neutrality. In the letter, he said such a policy would hinder the Digital India project and kill new startups. He said that he used such apps to interact with his constituency and this policy will hinder his functioning as a representative.[8][9]\n\nOn legalisation of cannabis [ edit ]\n\nTathagata Satpathy has criticised the ban on cannabis in India, while pointing out the long history of its usage as a ritual and recreational intoxicant. He has said that cannabis was banned in India while alcohol was not, because of \"an elitist bias\" as cannabis was a poor man's drug. He has said the addiction depends on person's character and not on the intoxicant. He has suggested an amendment to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 to allow recreational and medicinal usage of marijuana.[10] During his \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit in March 2015, Satpathy admitted that he smoked cannabis when he was young.[3][11] In August 2015, during the monsoon session of the Parliament, he proposed the decriminalisation of cannabis.[12] In December 2015, he repeated his proposal during the winter session, saying that banning cannabis has forced villagers to turn to alcohol.[13][14]\n\nOn homosexuality and moral policing [ edit ]\n\nTathagata Satpathy has condemned the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises homosexuality in India, calling it \"archaic\" and called for its repeal.[15] He had supported a bill introduced by INC MP Shashi Tharoor to decriminalise homosexuality during the 2015 winter session of the Parliament.[16] When the bill was defeated, Satpathy called it a very sad day.[17] Satpathy has also condemned moral policing and called for a repeal of laws banning pornography in India.[15]\n\nOn privacy and Aadhaar [ edit ]\n\nTathagata Satpathy has raised concerns that the Aadhaar project could be used for mass surveillance or ethnic cleansing in the future. He has questioned why a new identity card project was created despite having several identity cards systems. He has also criticised the decision to present the Aadhaar Bill, 2016 as a money bill. He pointed out that although the bill allows the sharing of biometric under circumstances of national security, there was no concrete definition of national security included in the bill.[18]\n\nOn religious laws and missionaries [ edit ]\n\nSatpathy supports the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code in India. He has criticised those current laws which are based on various religions, saying that the world is moving beyond religious scriptures and such laws only divide the society.[15] He has also said that a lot of faith-based foreign aid comes to Odisha through missionaries. They offer the poor Dalits free education and jobs, this results in mass conversions to Christianity.[19] Satpathy has said that politicians should use the dictionary definition of secularism to avoid confusion.[20]\n\nOther opinions [ edit ]\n\nSatpathy has supported the inclusion of Members of Parliament under the Jan Lokpal Bill to curb corruption.[21] In December 2015, he criticised the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 during a debate, saying that the government was favouring big corporations with such laws.[22] He has also criticised the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana calling it flawed and that it looks good only on paper. He said it forces him to choose only 8 villages from his constituency for development out of 3000.[23] Satpathy has opposed the proposal to make Hindi the national language.[20]\n\nSatpathy has criticised the construction of new nuclear power plants in India, claiming that most of the world was now moving away from nuclear energy. He has also claimed that Areva nuclear firm of France sold outdated technology to Maharashtra. He has also said that the centre should release the data regarding the safety of nuclear power plants as they are in other countries.[24][25]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]"}, {"url": "https://www.oneindia.com/politicians/tathagata-satpathy-34879.html", "page_content": "A Journalist by Profession turned Politician is the owner and editor of the daily Odia newspaper, Dharitri, and the English daily, Orissa Post.

The senior BJD leader, who is the party's chief whip in Lok Sabha, reinitiated his demand in the Lower House, wheeling away from the official position of his party.\n\n\"Cannabis is a drug that has been given a bad name, the alcohol lobby, peddling something far more dangerous, has managed to club cannabis with more dangerous narcotics,\" Satpathy had told The Hindu.\n\nBefore a Supreme Court of India (SC) verdict decriminalising homosexuality in September 2018, Satpathy was one of the few MPs who had batted for it. He had said that some socially relevant laws \"need a re-look\" and \"repealing\".\n\n\"I would give an example of something like Section 377, the law relating to a small section of society. But it has a relevance to a particular kind of people who are human beings, who have feelings like us, but their sexual needs are different from a lot of people we know,\" Satpathy had said. He is also against the ban on pornography, reasoning that with changing times, laws should also change in order to change the societal outlook.\n\nThe son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy, Tathagata entered politics during the 1980s, but tasted his first electoral success as a legislator in 1990. Satpathy had then contested on Janata Dal ticket, led by his current boss, Naveen Patnaik's father Biju Patnaik.\n\nThe MP later jumped to Odisha Gana Parishad (OGP) before switching back to the BJD during the 2004 general elections. He is the owner and Editor of Odiya daily Dharitri and English daily Orissa Post and had spoken in favour of net neutrality and the Jan Lokpal Bill.\n\nSatpathy has continued to remain in news for his comments. During the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Hyderabad University row, where leaders from both the spectrum were involved in mud-slinging, Satpathy's speech on the issue was praised by many as balanced.\n\n\"I am heartbroken to say that the youth of the country does not deserve us. We are the most undeserving set of people to be in this House today,\" the BJD leader had said in Lok Sabha, underlining a need to find solutions to the problems and keep the issue out of politics.\n\nThe MP, who is a member of Standing Committee on Coal and Steel, has 92 percent attendance in the lower house, according to PRS Legislative Research data and has participated in debates on Aadhaar Bill, Triple Talaq Bill and a discussion on sustainable development goals.\n\nHe quit politics on the insistence of his 13-year-old son, according to a report by Hindustan Times. He added that the decision had been on his mind for some time."}, {"url": "https://sambadenglish.com/people-shouldnt-jailed-speaking-mind-tathagata-satpathy/", "page_content": "By Nirendra Dev\n\nNew Delhi, Oct 4:\n\nAsserting that it made little sense in a democracy to jail people for \u201cspeaking their minds\u201d, senior Biju Janata Dal (BJD) member Tathagata Satpathy has said that the country\u2019s age-old defamation laws need an \u201curgent re-look\u201d and maintained that he would soon move a private member\u2019s bill in the Lok Sabha to bring about much-needed change.\n\n\u201cEssentially, I am questioning a law that actually puts the right to freedom of speech \u2014 as enshrined in the constitution itself \u2014 in question,\u201d Satpathy told IANS in an interview here.\n\n\u201cThe criminal defamation law, therefore, needs to go. The present law actually mandates a system wherein people can be jailed for speaking their minds. I have decided to move a private member\u2019s bill in the winter session (in November-December),\u201d he said.\n\nThe MP from Dhenkanal in Odisha maintained that lately he has been also provoked by \u201ctwo contradictory judgements\u201d on defamation laws.\n\n\u201cIn one case, the Supreme Court, on the request of petitioners Subramanian Swamy, Rahul Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal, considered the validity of the existing law and said it is constitutional. But in another case, the apex court counselled Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa to understand that public figures must face criticism. I am looking for more clarity,\u201d Satpathy said.\n\nIn its ruling in May, the apex court had noted that \u201cthe right to freedom of speech and expression is not an absolute right\u201d and that freedom of expression has to be \u201cbalanced with the other person\u2019s right to reputation\u201d, he said, but in August it said differently on Jayalalithaa\u2019s petition, pointing out that the criminal defamation law should not be misused.\n\nMaintaining that the existing laws have been \u201cgenerally abused\u201d, he said that, in his bill, he is trying to focus on three basic features: \u201cRemove criminality, protect reputation and codify and strengthen civil proceedings as the lower courts, in the absence of effective guidelines, create problems for subordinate judges to process cases.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many inherent contradictory issues in the defamation law. One can file both criminal and civil suits. The defamation amount is left to anybody\u2019s wild imagination. One popular news magazine was sued for Rs 500 crore. Is that magazine worth that huge amount?\u201d\n\nSatpathy, who has a penchant for taking as a compliment words like \u201cmaverick\u201d hurled at him, said: \u201cAs editor and publisher of my newspaper \u2018Dharitri\u2019, after a five-year defamation case in court, I was fined Rs 50,000 and jailed for six months.\u201d\n\nAsked whether his decision to push the bill would seek to protect the media as, on a number of occasions, defamation cases are filed against journalists and media organisations, Satpathy said, albeit in a lighter vein: \u201cIt is just the opposite. Actually, I want to protect the rich and my politician friends from you all bad journalists.\u201d\n\nSatpathy maintained that on the broader level, he looks at the issue of need for changes in the defamation law from a social perspective, saying: \u201cIf my suggestions are accepted and changes are brought about, this will go a long way in strengthening the judicial process vis-a-vis freedom of expression.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far the reforms we talk about are confined to the economic paradigm only. But we must note, we live in a society and not in an economy per se. So, unless we bring social reforms, we cannot have a sound legal system which would ultimately make economic reforms sustainable,\u201d he contended.\n\nHe said the initial response on his move from members of parliament has been overwhelming. \u201cI have got good response and MPs have assured cooperation. I have also spoken to (Union Law Minister) Ravi Shankar Prasad and (BJP MP) Subaramanian Swamy, who happens to be at the receiving end of defamation laws,\u201d he said.

We are the most undeserving set of people to be in this House today,\" Satpathy, who represents Dhenkanal Lok Sabha constituency in the Lok Sabha, said.\n\nHe went on to say: \u201cI am not interested in taking sides with any of these parties. I am here to hear who has a word of solace and point of solution to the problems that the nation is facing today. Is it only votes that matter? Is it just us and them?\"\n\nHis speech went viral on social media with people praising him for taking the matter above politics. This is not the first time that Satpathy has stood out among other parliamentarians. On several other occasions in the past, he has articulated his views on women\u2019s reservation, crimes against women, net neutrality, Section 377 and even legalisation of cannabis.\n\nDuring an AMA (ask me anything) session on Reddit last year, Satpathy admitted that he had smoked cannabis. \u201cWhile in college, I have smoked (and unlike Bill Clinton have inhaled) cannabis many a times. In villages of Orissa, many people openly smoke and, as their representative, I am not entitled to be judgmental.\"\n\nSpeaking to Mint after his speech in Parliament, Satpathy said he speaks his mind, does not fear controversies and believes in change through debate.\n\nThe 59-year-old, also the chief whip of the BJD, is the son of Odisha\u2019s only woman chief minister Nandini Satpathy. He is currently serving his fourth term as a member of the lower house of Parliament. A journalist by profession, Satpathy is the owner and editor of leading Odia daily Dharitri and English daily Orissa Post.\n\n\u201cWe have been harping on rights for far too long. Time has changed to expose the wrongs,\" Satpathy said. He added that it is time politicians start talking truthfully and make citizens conscious of their duties and responsibilities. \u201cIndia is going through a churning. I am an optimist. I see good times ahead.\"\n\nEven during the monsoon session last year, when 25 Congress MPs were suspended, Satpathy spoke up in the lower house and made a strong plea against taking up any legislative business in the absence of MPs from several opposition parties, including Congress.\n\nThough Satpathy does not have a personal Twitter or Facebook account, his office runs a Twitter account on his behalf at @SatpathyLive. \u201cI am more a print media guy. I regret to say that I am not very social media savvy, though I am very social. I love to sit down with my friends and chat,\" he said.\n\nHis attendance record in the current Lok Sabha has been 93% as opposed to an average of 83% for parliamentarians. In the 16th Lok Sabha, he has participated in a total of 34 debates and asked three questions, according to the New Delhi-based PRS Legislative Research.\n\n\u201cParliament is partisan when it comes to giving more time and importance to leaders from parties. Someone like Satpathy would be heard and much more noticed outside Parliament than inside. His is a sane and rational voice. The point that he made on Tuesday about us and them is very critical. The way we are, our politicians are, there seems to be no middle ground and in that way he was making a very important statement,\" said Manisha Priyam, a New Delhi-based political analyst."}]}
