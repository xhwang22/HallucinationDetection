As he told Jake Niall in 1996, he had persuaded the Swans to draft his former team member.However North\u2019s pick 46 was three before Sydney\u2019s and King went on to become a vital part of the best team in the 1990\u2019s.An attacking half-back and wingman, he instantly became a best 22 player and kept that mantle for more than a decade. Throughout his career, he never played less than 19 games in a year.A two-time All-Australian and two-time premiership player, King also represented Australia twice in the International Rules Series and was named an emergency in North\u2019s Team of the Century. All from a player considered the 46th best in his draft class.Considering King was recently re-ranked as the fifth best player from the 1993 draft by the Herald Sun and North also selected Adam Simpson with pick 14 in the same draft, it was a memorable off-season that helped set the club up for the most successful era in its history.#46, 1993 National Draft241145Trent Bartlett, Brisbane (81 games)Chris Palmer, Hawthorn (0 games)"}, {"url": "https://www.nmfc.com.au/news/38751/draft-history-of-pick-46", "page_content": "With all the wheeling and dealing of the AFL exchange period, draft picks were shuffled between clubs across the board.\n\nThe final order for the National Draft was released on Friday, with North moving up the ranks in the third round from pick 47 to 46.\n\nWhen it comes to lottery picks, selection 46 certainly fits in the mix.\n\nAcross 29 drafts, players taken with pick 29 have combined for just 1,221 games, with an average of 42 career matches.\n\nAs was somewhat of a common theme with picks outside of the first couple of rounds in early drafts, pick 46 experienced a run of outs between 1986 and 1991. The first six players taken with selection 46 never played at VFL/AFL level.\n\nThe Saints\u2019 Matthew Jackson broke the drought, albeit for four career games only, before a young man by the name of David King joined North Melbourne in 1993.\n\nA mature-age recruit at 21, King arrived from VFL team Port Melbourne. He was fast, skillful and aggressive, making an immediate impact with 19 games in his first season.\n\nA two-time All-Australian, he retired with 241 games to his name and two premiership medallions as perhaps the most memorable pick 46 of all-time.\n\nThere were some lean years to follow for the pick after \u201993, with the super-talented Justin Charles who was drafted in \u201994 perhaps the most memorable for reasons both good and bad.\n\nCharles\u2019 work ethic helped him to become one of the competition\u2019s best ruckmen, so much so he finished sixth in the 1996 Brownlow Medal.\n\nBut his career ended in controversy, as he copped a 16-week ban for using an anabolic steroid as tried to return from a lengthy stint on the sidelines due to injury.

We will be okay without you.\n\n\u201cYou are not the reason we are going to be a good football club. You are part of the reason, but you are not the absolute reason.\n\n\u201cAm I disappointed that he didn\u2019t really adjust to Melbourne life? Did he really give the North Melbourne Football Club a chance? I question that.\n\n\u201cI question whether he absolutely respected the senior players and respected what it was to be in a professional environment and prepare yourself to the nth degree.\n\n\u201cWe thank him for what he has done and his year of service and we move on.\u201d\n\nKing played 241 games in the blue and white over his 11-year career, and he was a member of North\u2019s 1996 and 1999 premiership winning sides and is a two-time AFL All-Australian.\n\nSince his retirement, King has become part of the football media landscape, working for Fox Footy and SEN 1116.\n\nBut even though he covers the league as a whole, King said he still had a special affection for the Kangaroos.\n\n\u201cMost of my opportunities in my life have come through North Melbourne, so there is always a soft spot for the club,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI have real empathy for those that are working as hard as they are at the moment and not getting anywhere, I ride the bumps with the club, but I try not to show it.\u201d\n\nIt has been a hard few seasons for North with the Kangaroos finishing last on the ladder in back-to-back seasons, but King said he hoped the club could turn things around.\n\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t go any lower, we have finished 17th, 18th, 18th in the last three seasons,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe just hope that Alastair Clarkson can come back, get his feet under the desk and deliver on what is an unbelievable coaching CV and help build this football club.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to talk about finals or winning finals, we just need to get some credibility back.\u201d\n\nKing was in Echuca on Tuesday as one of the guests at the Echuca Racecourse\u2019s annual publicans day.\n\nHe was invited up by his good friend and renowned football commentator Tony Leonard \u2014 who was the MC for the day \u2014 and King said he jumped at the opportunity.\n\nThe pair have known each other for 20 years, with King commentating alongside Leonard back in the day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Tony for a long time. When I first came out of footy I worked with 3AW, and Tony was part of the biggest calling team in the game back then with Rex Hunt,\u201d king said.\n\n\u201cI have had a great relationship with Tony for a long period of time. I still think he is the best caller in footy. He is not the best to look at, but he is the best to listen to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love it up this way. I went to Assumption College, most of the guys there were boarders from Rochester, Elmore, Deniliquin and Echuca.\n\n\u201cI love the area and I love getting to come up here.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a country boy, so I like country people. I think they have a different manner about them \u2014 they are more welcoming, they are more themselves, they are genuine.\n\n\u201cThey are different to city folk. It is a more cruisy, relaxed atmosphere. Everyone is happy to have a beer and a laugh.\u201d\n\nKing was part of North Melbourne\u2019s golden generation in the mid-late 90s, but he said there was a distinctly country footy feel about the AFL club at the time.\n\n\u201cIt was like a country football club playing in the AFL, that is how I would describe it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was great. We were so thick and so tight. The guys went everywhere together \u2014 we won together, we lost together. We grew up from teenagers into men, into fathers and husbands, we lived all that together and it was such a great ride.\n\n\u201cThe North Melbourne Football Club I know would be the same as the Echuca Football Netball club or any regional club. We were just a good bunch of lads that got on so well.\u201d\n\nThe hard-nosed midfielder and defender won two premierships and played in more than a dozen finals throughout his career. But looking back, he said it was a different game that stood out as the most memorable.\n\n\u201cProbably the most special game in my memory would be after the Wayne Carey saga,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe went to Port Adelaide 10 days after the Carey story broke, we had to play in round one against Port Adelaide over there, and we won.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have won, but we did, it was unbelievable.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://au.sports.yahoo.com/afl-2022-david-king-criticises-north-melbourne-mega-trade-deal-211604222.html", "page_content": "David King has criticised his former club North Melbourne over a mega trade deal that will see Jason Horne-Francis move to Port Adelaide.

It has remained so, even with a change of name (VFL) and some restructuring. Carlton, though, has since won a premiership with a team topped up with twentysomething rejects and, predictably, there is more interest in late developers as a result.\n\nKing makes us wonder how many other late bloomers have slipped through the net. As Damian Drum, coach at Port Melbourne in King's last season there (1993), recalled that recruiting men took the view that because King hadn't been an elite junior, he was a risky proposition. \"A lot of clubs kept saying, 'why didn't he play Teal Cup? Why didn't he play (AFL) under 19s'?\" Drum says.\n\nKing said: \"It was a bit strange at the time to be too old at 21.\"\n\nDrum, though, was convinced King had the right stuff. He was fast, hard at the ball and could kick the\n\nball 60 metres. When Drum joined Sydney as assistant coach in '93, he persuaded the Swans to draft him. The problem was that North got in first and grabbed him - at No. 46.\n\nKing might have been a late developer, but at 22 he was an immediate senior player, playing most of the games in '94 and last year. His coach, Denis Pagan, says King has made the next step this year. \"He's come on in leaps and bounds and he's had a very good year,\" Pagan said.\n\nIn '94 and last year, King played mostly on the wing. His emergence to the next level this year can be\n\nattributed, in part, to his shift to defence, mainly the back pocket, where his combination of straight-ahead flair, pace and long kicking has made him the dasher of the North defence.\n\n\"Maybe the straight-ahead running has helped a bit,\" said King. \"I played a lot of footy on the half-back line before North.\"\n\nDrum believes King is far better suited to a hard-running defensive role than a midfield position. He kept King at half-back in 1993, although he was the stand-out player at Port and, as he was the team\u0092s highest-possession winner, everyone kept asking Drum \"why don\u0092t you play him in the centre?\"\n\nDrum said: \"He\u0092s more damaging coming out of defence. He nearly carries the ball 20-25 metres and he can kick it 60 metres - the net result us 80-85 metres.\"\n\nPagan, who clearly likes King\u0092s hard-hitting style, says: \"He has the ability to read it and the courage to make the first move. He is a very attacking back-pocket player.\"\n\nBut Pagan recognised that King\u0092s flair meant that, at times, he posed a defensive risk. \"That\u0092s the price you play when you play with such gutso. He\u0092s very explosive. He\u0092s a real burst player very hard at it.\"\n\nRemarkably, King was not a regular senior player at Port Melbourne in his first season and even played games in the twos in 1992. King says had he been snared by an AFL club at 18, he wouldn't have made it. \"Physically, I wasn't strong enough.\"\n\nKing is testament to the importance of pace in the modern game. As Ronny De Iulio and Joheve shown at Carlton and Footscray respectively this year, there ie alraa quick player. It's one thing to ha thing to have pace, said King, the key is \"learning to use to your advantage.\"\n\n\"I don't mind a bounce. I don't think Denis has a problem with it (running with the ball).

However, his explosive dashes out of the half back line and ball carrying ability did catch the attention of North Melbourne recruiters, and after 43 senior games with the Boroughs between 1990 and 1993, King was taken at number 46 in the 1993 National Draft.\n\nAt North Melbourne, where he fitted seamlessly into an already strong line-up, King enjoyed a very solid first year before going from strength to strength. During the course of an 11-season, 241 game, 145-goal AFL career, he achieved virtually everything the modern game has to offer. A tough, pacy, relentlessly aggressive footballer, he was equally adept in a number of positions, including the wing, a back pocket or half back flank, and ruck-rover. He was a key contributor to the 'Roos 1996 and 1999 premiership victories, and made the AFL All Australian team in 1997 and 1998. He also represented Victoria. David King retired at the end of the 2004 season.\n\nAuthor - John Devaney with additional material from Adam Cardosi"}, {"url": "https://www.nmfc.com.au/club/history/draft-history", "page_content":
