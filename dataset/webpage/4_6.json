Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, also was elected as a contributor.\n\nFinchem was PGA Tour commissioner when the World Golf Hall of Fame opened in 1998 in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\n\"One of the great things about that is to get know the inductees who I didn't know in other aspects of my job,'' Finchem said Monday. \"It's a tremendous list of people. To be included in that group is very powerful. I want to thank those who thought I was deserving of it. In many ways, I didn't feel I am deserving because I just had so much fun being in the job for so long.''\n\nFinchem found it fitting that he joins the induction class of 2021 with Tiger Woods, whom he first saw at a college tournament his first year as commissioner in 1994. Later that year, Finchem noticed players finishing up their rounds at the World Series of Golf at Firestone and watching an 18-year-old Woods win the first of three straight U.S. Amateurs.\n\nWoods was elected through the male player category a month ago. Marion Hollins, one of the leading women in golf a century ago, was elected as a contributor.\n\n\"It is the greatest honor to be elected to join golf's most legendary players and contributors in the World Golf Hall of Fame,\" Finchem said. \"I am especially proud to stand alongside one of the world's all-time greats, Tiger Woods, in the Class of 2021 and look forward to what will be an exciting year ahead.\"\n\nWoods joined the PGA Tour in 1996 after two years at Stanford and brought enormous attention to himself and to the tour. Along with winning twice in seven starts, Woods won the Masters in his first attempt as a pro by setting 20 records, including a 12-shot victory that set off the first wave of \"Tigermania.''\n\nFinchem seized on it.\n\nHe was in the middle of negotiating a new network television contract, and prize money spiked. More deals followed in 2001, 2006 and 2012. PGA Tour prize money went from under $100 million on three tours in 1994 when Finchem was appointed commissioner to more than $400 million over six tours when he retired at the end of 2016.\n\nFormer PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem, left, has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame. He'll be part of a 2021 class that will also include Tiger Woods. AP Photo/Phil Long\n\nFinchem laughed Monday when asked what his job would have been like had Woods played tennis.\n\n\"It would have been a much more difficult job,'' he said. \"Tiger coming on the scene ... took our sport to another level. It continues on today. As a sport, we were blessed he didn't like tennis.''\n\nIt wasn't just money, however.\n\nFinchem created The First Tee program shortly after Woods won the Masters. Turning back Greg Norman's proposal for a world tour, Finchem came up with the World Golf Championships series in 1999 that led to three events for players from the leading six tours around the world. He also took advantage of a growing class of international players from outside Europe -- Norman, Nick Price, Ernie Els, Vijay Singh among those -- by starting the Presidents Cup in 1994.\n\nAt the heart of Finchem's work was making the PGA Tour logo recognizable around the world, a symbol of strength.\n\nThe PGA Tour had a development circuit (now called the Korn Ferry Tour) and a senior tour (now the PGA Tour Champions) for players 50 and older. Now it has circuits in Canada (Mackenzie Tour), Latin America and China.\n\n\"Tim Finchem's vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\" said Jay Monahan, whom Finchem groomed as his successor.\n\nMonahan delivered the news to Finchem during The Players Championship, two days before golf joined so many other sports in shutting down because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSome of Finchem's best work came during tough times. He kept the PGA Tour fully sponsored during the recession in 2008 and, as a show of strength, kept prize money from shrinking.\n\nThe Hall of Fame is expected to announce a fourth inductee later this week."}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/tim-finchem/biography", "page_content": "Tim Finchem Biography\n\nAmerican lawyer\n\nTimothy W.

Tim Finchem helped the PGA tour to pursue a jump from less than $60 million per year back in 1994 to more than $250 million per year by 2006. At the induction ceremony of the World Golf Hall of Fame 2022, Finchem took the further step to enhance the Players Championship events, building a new clubhouse, and renovating the course in 2006.\n\nEarly Life\n\nTim was born on 19th April 1947 in Ottawa, Illinois, and is currently living in his late 50s. He went to the Princess Anne High School, Virginia, where he received his primary education. Later, he went to receive his secondary education from the University of Richmond, receiving a bachelor of arts in 1969. Finchem received his degree of law from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1973. He had a paper route and used to perform other off jobs.\n\nRather than spending his money on purchasing candy and other small toys, Finchem was interested since childhood to play golf. So he used to spend his money only on playing golf. Finchem was brought by Harold (father) who was a career marine and used to permit his 8 years old young child to play golf with his buddies. Finchem is one of the oldest sons born in a family of six children, including three boys and three girls.\n\nTim Finchem Career\n\nBefore coming into the field of gold administration, Tim Finchem had pursued a great career in the line of law and practice.

He succeeded the position of Deane Beman, who retired from the position after serving for at least 20 years.\n\nPrevious to this, Finchem went to experience the responsibilities of the Vice President of Business Affairs, Deputy Commissioner, and Chief Operating Officer of the Tour. While being a commissioner, Finchem worked on the earning opportunities and let the PGA Tour players serve the increase in both domestic as well as international tours. Finchem remained the president of the television broadcasting deals for at least three years in 1997, 2001, and 2005. Back in 2006, Finchem helped the PGA tour to meet the hike from $56.4 million in 1994 to $256.8 million in 2006.

The Presidents Cup gave the sport another great international competition. And the World Golf Championships created greater opportunities for international golfers to compete together beyond the majors. And the 1997 rights deal he negotiated changed the relationship between TV and golf forever as it required every round of every tournament be carried on TV.\n\n\u201cThe most impressive thing about Tim is he was a remarkable consensus builder,\u201d says Sean McManus, CBS Sports, chairman. \u201cHis relationships with the players, with the tournaments, with the sponsors, and TV networks were all first rate where everyone felt like they were getting full value.\u201d\n\nHe also spearheaded efforts to coordinate the bid for golf\u2019s return to the Olympics, which became a reality in the 2016 Games after a 112-year absence and gave NBC a chance to bring one of its most important rest-of-the-year properties to its Olympic programming schedule.\n\n\u201cTim Finchem super-charged the PGA TOUR during his tenure as commissioner by adding World Golf Championships, the Presidents Cup, and the FedEx Playoffs,\u201d says Molly Solomon, executive producer/president, NBC Olympics Production, and executive producer, Golf Channel. \u201cWhat the PGA TOUR looks like today is due in large part to his big ideas and creative leadership.\u201d\n\nAdds Tommy Roy, NBC Sports, lead golf producer, credits Finchem with allowing NBC to have more than a dozen cameras on the island green for THE PLAYERS Championship, allowing the network to capture shots from almost any angle.\n\n\u201cHe gave us the ability to put a camera six feet away from Tiger Woods when he was about to execute a magical, game winning shot,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd he also gave us the ability to put microphones three feet away from Phil Mickelson and [caddie] Bones when they were discussing the execution of a great shot.\u201d\n\nSports Broadcasting Hall of Famer Dick Ebersol says he was lucky enough to have a front row seat to Finchem\u2019s efforts.\n\n\u201cTim built the PGA Tour into one of the most important franchises in all of American TV sports,\u201d he adds.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, he helped oversee First Tee\u2019s growth into a great youth-development organization, reaching more than 15 million youngsters (during his tenure as commissioner, the PGA TOUR and its tournaments raised more than $2 billion in charitable contributions).\n\n\u201cTim Finchem\u2019s vision and leadership have made an indelible impact on the game of golf over the past 25 years,\u201d said Jay Monahan, PGA TOUR commissioner and World Golf Foundation board chairman, when Finchem was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame last year. \u201cHis enshrinement in the World Golf Hall of Fame will forever stand as a testament to his tireless dedication and contributions, but, more important, so will the countless lives \u2014 whether those are the players on the PGA TOUR and beyond, millions of First Tee participants, or charitable organizations around the world \u2014 impacted by his life\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nFinchem became commissioner in 1994 when then-Commissioner Deane Beman, just 55 years old, retired to resume his playing career, this time as a member of the then-Senior PGA TOUR.\n\n\u201cMy history is one of just being in the right place at the right time,\u201d says Finchem. \u201cSo much of where you\u2019re headed is based on the individuals that you\u2019re interfacing with.\u201d\n\nFor example, prior to joining the PGA TOUR, Finchem was in the Jimmy Carter Administration, working with the president and his staff.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a great run with regard to being around people who are extremely successful and thoughtful and committed to making this place a better place to live,\u201d he says. \u201cI look back at all those people I met and the players that I interfaced with, and I was very, very fortunate to be in the right place at the right time.\u201d One example: he became commissioner only a few weeks before a player named Tiger Woods turned professional.\n\nAnd the beginning of the Woods era and the beginning of Finchem\u2019s tenure as commissioner coincided with a time when some of the greats of the game had retired but were still an active part of the PGA efforts.\n\n\u201cI was lucky,\u201d Finchem says, \u201cbecause I came into the PGA TOUR at a time when I had the opportunity to meet Sam Snead and Byron Nelson and all these great players and spend a fair amount of time with them. In some ways, many of those players were similar to working with the president because of their knowledge of the sport, their intensity about transferring that information to fans and to people like myself.\u201d\n\nFinchem always had a passion for golf and freely admits to using his paper-route money to support his golf habit.\n\n\u201cMy dad was in the Marine Corps for 30 years, and I started playing golf when I was 8 or 10,\u201d he says. \u201cHe took me to the Azalea Open in North Carolina; Arnold Palmer won, and I was mesmerized by him. Years later, I\u2019d call him up from time to time and say, Take me through one of your wins. He\u2019d say, Which one? and I\u2019d tell him that one.\u201d\n\nAlthough nearly half his adult life has been spent at the PGA TOUR, Finchem didn\u2019t set out to work in sports administration. He attended the University of Richmond on a debate scholarship and graduated in 1969, then received his law degree from Virginia four years later. After practicing law in Virginia Beach for three years, Finchem served in the Carter White House as deputy advisor to the president in the Office of Economic Affairs in 1978 and 1979.\n\n\u201cTim\u2019s leadership was invaluable for the growth of the game,\u201d says Sports Broadcasting Hall of Famer and CBS Sports Lead Play-by-Play Announcer Jim Nantz. \u201cHis thoughtful decision-making helped the PGA TOUR soar to incredible heights. He led his global partners in promoting and implementing a World Golf Championship series, and, here at home, he brought life to the PGA TOUR\u2019s end of the season.

A former deputy adviser for economic affairs to President Jimmy Carter and the national staff director for the Carter-Mondale presidential campaign in 1980, Finchem is regarded as a Washington insider.\n\nFinchem takes over an organization that has very few pressing problems. He will have to overcome some opposition from a group of players who wanted Beman's successor to come from the ranks of touring pros. Finchem, a four-handicap at the TPC at Sawgrass, is the equivalent of a scratch player when it comes to negotiating.\n\n\"I think we'll just handle that head-on,\" he said. \"What I really want to do is sit down and talk to every single player, particularly players who might have some misgivings, look them in the eye and tell them about what my approach will be to the job.\""}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/29070837/tim-finchem-former-pga-tour-commissioner-elected-world-golf-hall-fame", "page_content": "Tim Finchem, who expanded the PGA Tour's footprint around the world and negotiated TV contracts that more than tripled prize money during his two decades as commissioner, has been elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nFinchem was elected through the contributor category and will become the 10th administrator to be inducted, joining predecessor Deane Beman.

The confrontation to see who would handle the purse strings of a lucrative world golf tour was never a contest.\n\nNorman got the early advantage when he blind-sided the PGA Tour commissioner with his plan for the World Tour in 1994, but Finchem crushed what threatened to be a lengthy legal challenge with shocking suddenness.\n\nThe final blow came last week at the Tour Championship when Finchem--speaking for the five major PGA tours of the world--announced the creation of three $4 million World Golf Championship events in 1999 and a fourth the following year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust like that, wealth undreamed of even by Norman three years ago when he led a breakaway challenge to the PGA Tour was handed to the best players in the world by Finchem, with the commissioner unquestionably in charge.\n\nThe World Tour came to golf last week and the center of the world was clearly in Finchem\u2019s office in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., and not in Norman\u2019s Great White Shark Enterprises headquarters down the coast in Tequestra.\n\n\u201cYou know, I understand why it happened a couple of years ago, why people, separate groups, weren\u2019t all for it,\u201d Norman said Wednesday, struggling to contain his anger as he acknowledged that Finchem had taken his idea and run with it.\n\n\u201cI think there is only one word for it,\u201d Norman said, \u201cand that word is control. Now control is there, in their mind, and let them have it, let them go with it, let them see what they can do.\u201d\n\nControl was clearly the issue in 1994 when Norman, John D. Montgomery Jr. of Executive Sports, a Florida-based firm that runs some tournaments, and Fox Sports announced a World Tour that guaranteed the top-30 players in the world a minimum of $290,000 a year.\n\n\u201cThis is about 30 years overdue,\u201d Norman said at the time.\n\nThe plan then called for eight events held in the United States, Canada, Scotland, Spain and Japan with 30 players selected based on world rankings and 10 additional players given exemptions.\n\nEach event would have had a $3 million purse with $600,000 going to the winner and $30,000 guaranteed to the last-place finisher. There would have been a $1 million bonus to the player of the year, and each competing player would get a $50,000-a-year travel allowance.\n\nAt the time, the $600,000 first-place money was more than twice that offered in the average tour event. The three new events announced last week by Finchem will have a first prize of at least $720,000.\n\n\u201cEverybody I\u2019ve spoken to--Nick Price, Fred Couples, Jose Maria Olazabal--all the responses have been extremely positive,\u201d Norman had said.\n\nWithin days, however, it was clear than no one was rushing to jump on the Norman bandwagon. Finchem had made it clear that anyone playing on the World Tour would be walking away from the PGA Tour.\n\n\u201cIf a new tour becomes a reality in 1995 or thereafter, our members will have to decide whether they want to continue to play on the PGA Tour or play on a new tour,\u201d Finchem said at the time.\n\nThe commissioner said he would enforce the \u201cconflicting events\u201d rules requiring players to get his permission to play in outside events, and Finchem said the PGA would go to court to defend those rules.\n\n\u201cThis is not dissimilar from the decision professional athletes in other sports were forced to make when competing leagues were formed,\u201d Finchem said.\n\nJust like that, the World Tour had a plan, money and a TV deal with Fox--but it had no players.\n\nEveryone backed off, even Norman. But it was clear Norman resented Finchem for the power play, and he used whatever opportunity he could to show his displeasure.\n\nLast year, Norman showed up a day late at the Tour Championship, missing the pro-am used to entertain high-roller backers of the PGA Tour. He was the only player who didn\u2019t stay around for the rain-delayed final round on Monday.\n\nNorman also started this year with a snub of the tour, skipping the Mercedes Championships. He was the only one of the 1996 tournament winners to skip the event.\n\nFinchem and Norman both always denied there was any bad blood between them. But Finchem made it clear who was in charge and Norman was still feeling the sting when he saw Finchem modify the World Tour idea and present it as his own.\n\n\u201cI took a lot of heat and a lot of criticism early on,\u201d Norman said Wednesday. \u201cThe arrows can hopefully now come out of my back and we can all go forward.\u201d\n\nFinchem tried to smooth things as best he could by recognizing Norman\u2019s contribution to the new events.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Greg for his continued involvement and commitment,\u201d Finchem said. \u201cI think he\u2019s had a positive influence.\u201d\n\nNorman, however, clearly wants everyone to remember that if it were not for his rebellion three years ago, the World Golf Championships likely would not have come to be--at least not this quickly.\n\n\u201cI think it goes to show that I had the foresight, I had the knowledge of what makes the players tick, what makes the game of golf tick and what people are looking for,\u201d said Norman, who called Finchem\u2019s plan a \u201cmirror image of what I proposed three years ago.\u201d\n\nSurely, there were tweaks in the World Tour plan from 1994 and what Finchem and the four other tours came up with. But the ultimate change was exactly what Norman pointed out--control.\n\nAnd the answer to that was clear last week at the Tour championship. Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour are in control of world golf."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Tim_Finchem", "page_content": "What we do.

He made it through a recession by keeping tournaments fully sponsored, and even while Tiger Woods was struggling through a collapse in his personal life and with leg injuries, Finchem negotiated a nine-year television deal with NBC Sports and CBS Sports.\n\nBut he suggested two years ago he probably wouldn't stay after 2016.\n\n\"I never rule out possibilities,\" Finchem said in January 2012. \"But the likelihood is this will probably be it for me. There's other things I want to do.\""}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/tim-finchem/biography", "page_content": "Tim Finchem Biography\n\nAmerican lawyer\n\nTimothy W.
