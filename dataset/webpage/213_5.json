He was born in Riga, Latvia, on 24 July 1794. Pander, with an eclectic history of research, is best remembered for his discovery and explanation of the structure of the chick blastoderm, a term he coined. In doing so, Pander was able to achieve the goal set forth by his teacher, Ignaz D\u00f6llinger, to reinvigorate the study of the chick embryo as a means of further exploring the science of embryology as a whole. His findings paved the way for the work of Karl Ernst von Baer, who would later revolutionize the field of embryology with his research.\n\nPander initially studied in the local schools of his hometown, Riga, and eventually enrolled in the University of Dorpat in 1812. While studying there, Pander attempted to pursue an education in both medical science as well as natural history. It was during this time that Pander began to work with an anatomist named Karl Friedrich Burdach who had previously taught Karl Ernst von Baer. Pander left Dorpat in 1814 and traveled to Germany. It was there in 1816 that Pander met von Baer, who convinced him to study at the University of W\u00fcrzburg under the tutelage of Ignaz D\u00f6llinger. Pander agreed and traveled to W\u00fcrzburg where he received his MD in 1817. It was also here that he published his dissertation, Historia Metamorphoseos Quam Ovum Incubatum Prioribus Quinque Diebus Subit, a study of the components of the chick embryo including detailed illustrations by Eduard Joseph d\u2019Alton.\n\nDuring his work at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Pander discovered the blastoderm of the chick embryo. The blastoderm is the outermost cellular layer of the embryo, which Pander believed contributed greatly to embryonic development. He studied the blastoderm\u2019s role in early embryonic development, describing the outer, middle, and inner layers in detail while only being able to conclude that the development of blood vessels occurred in the middle layer and that important events of embryonic development followed thereafter. Despite the lack of in-depth conclusions, Pander\u2019s discovery and recognition of the blastoderm as well as the layered structure of the embryo provided invaluable information and guidance to his colleagues as well as future embryologists, including von Baer.\n\nDespite promising early research, Pander did not pursue further work in the study of chick embryos or embryology in general. After he obtained his MD and published his dissertation, Pander began traveling through Europe visiting science museums and continuing his work of observation in the fields of biology, paleontology, and geology. His primary goal in doing so was to visit and study the newest and most intricate fossils and skeletons discovered in different parts of the world. Pander eventually began to publish a series of works on osteology, the study of bones, collaborating once again with E. J. d\u2019Alton. Pander became a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1821 and a member of the St. Petersburg Zoological Academy in 1826. For the remainder of his life, Pander lived mainly in his estate near his hometown of Riga while still taking time to travel and continue his work in the fields of geology and paleontology, though none of his later work gained significant recognition. Pander died on 22 September 1865 in St. Petersburg. Though somewhat inconclusive, Pander\u2019s work with chick embryos and their components marked the beginning of a more advanced understanding of embryology."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13239-013-0118-x", "page_content": "The general morphological and physiological development of the heart of a variety of vertebrates has been described in numerous textbooks and treatises. For most recent discussion, the reader is referred to the following studies on popular vertebrate animal models for cardiovascular development, which can provide an entry into the voluminous literature: zebrafish, Danio rerio 3,41,45,60; African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis 49,62; chicken, Gallus gallus 51,75 and see numerous articles in Ref. 10; mouse, Mus musculus.64,78\n\nMorphological Development\n\nThe heart anlage derives from two lateral masses of splanchnic mesoderm on either side of the embryo\u2019s central longitudinal axis. These masses migrate towards the dorsal midline and subsequently merge to form the heart tube. These movements are under the control of the Mil gene and sphingosine-1-phosphate, which is a lysosphingolipid that acts as a Mil ligand.55 Weak, irregular peristaltic contractions of the heart tube begin at this time, which is typically around 24 h in the zebrafish embryo and 42\u201346 h in the chicken embryo. Erythropoiesis also occurs coincident with heartbeat, as evident in small numbers of immature red cells in the dilute plasma within the forming vessels.77 The circulation lacking discrete one-way valves at this point in development, these peristaltic movements of the forming heart walls generate a futile back-and-forth motion of the forming blood, although the developing endocardial cushion soon provides some valve-like function. Within hours the heart migrates anterio-posteriorly and the linear tube shape folds into a helically wound loop formed into an S-shaped curve.3,80 A constriction subsequently develops at the atrio-ventricular boundary, creating the atrio-ventricular canal, and the main body of the heart continues migrating until the atrium is anterior to the ventricle. Discrete contractions of the atrium and ventricle replace peristaltic contraction as the primary mechanism for propelling blood in a one-way direction, aided by the appearance of both cardiac and peripheral vascular valves that reduce retrograde blood flow following cardiac contraction. In those vertebrates with a completely divided ventricle, the intraventricular septum arises from the floor of the single primitive ventricle and grows anteriorly to close off the ventricle into left and right chambers, congruent with the appearance of the great arches, which have arisen from neural crest tissue.63 Division of the atrium into left and right atria (except in fishes) is a slightly more complex process than ventricular division, and involves the fusion of multiple structures, including the septa primum and secundum. The heart\u2019s conduction system is functional at this point in development, as evident from the ability to record an electrocardiogram with the essential electrical components of the adult heart, at about the same time that chamber formation of the heart is complete\u2014for example about 50\u201352 h (HH 13, 20 somites) in the chicken embryo.70,87\n\nOnce chamber formation is complete, hyperplastic growth of the heart transitions to hypertrophic growth, and the main changes that occur are in the regulation and subsequent physiological performance of the heart, as will now be considered.\n\nPhysiological Performance and Regulation of the Embryonic Heart\n\nGreat variation exists in the \u201cplumbing\u201d of the cardiovascular systems of the vertebrates, and this is reflected in the physiological performance of their hearts and vasculature. The adult fish heart is essentially a two chamber heart with atrium and ventricle in series, producing a relatively high blood pressure to which the gas exchange organ (the gills) is exposed. In amphibians and most reptiles, there are two atria and a variety of ventricular arrangements, some of which can allow for the development of high systemic pressure but low pulmonary pressure even as both \u201cleft-to-right\u201d and \u201cright-to-left\u201d shunts can develop (e.g. varanid lizards and python snakes). In the crocodilians, the ventricle is completely divided, but the capability for blood shunting between pulmonary and systemic sides is preserved because of the central vascular arrangement. In the homeotherms (birds and mammals), the heart is essentially a low pressure pulmonary pump (the right side of the heart) and a high pressure systemic pump (the left side of the heart) located in series. Much has been written not only on the forms of the adult heart, but also on the presumed evolution of these arrangements, and the reader is directed to these representative reviews for an entry into the voluminous literature.2,9,11,12,21,26,28,39,69\n\nDespite this fascinating evolutionary divergence of the cardiovascular plan in adult vertebrates, the situation is quite different when considering an embryonic perspective. The development of all vertebrate hearts follows a surprisingly similar common plan because of the highly conserved nature of the genetic regulation of the generation of the cardiac and vascular tissues from the pluripotent cells of early embryo. Thus, the basic description of a tube heart that grows into an S-fold, followed by additional condensation and chamber formation, as described in \u201cIntroduction\u201d section above, generally holds for all vertebrate embryos. Not surprisingly, then, the physiological performance of the circulation of various early vertebrate embryos is also very similar. Indeed, we can meaningfully refer to the \u201cvertebrate heart\u201d in early embryonic stages, a construct that would be meaningless if applied to adults of any or all of the five different vertebrate classes.\n\nHow, then, does the embryonic vertebrate heart begin to function, and what general patterns can be discerned? Briefly, the rate of beat of the heart, having progressed beyond the tube heart stage, is initially quite variable between species,15,68 ranging from less than 50 beats/min in poikilotherms (\u201ccold-blooded\u201d animals) at moderate temperatures (e.g. frogs) to well beyond 150\u2013200 beats/min in birds and mammals. In many species, heart rate increases sharply in the first hours and days of beating, eventually beginning to decrease once again, perhaps reflecting standard allometric scaling relationships within the rapidly growing embryo, in which larger animals, including larger embryos, have lower heart rates than smaller ones.15 In others, heart rate declines or stays level during early development. In fact, heart rate per se indicates little of cardiac function, requiring additional factors such as blood velocity, stroke volume and/or cardiac output to be assessed. Blood flow in the embryonic vertebrate heart coincides with blood pressure generation, and becomes more effective once one-way valves have formed at the base of the outflow vessels.\n\nBlood pressure generation coincides with the onset of pulsatility, and by the formation of the compact, folded heart and its valves. Systolic pressures begin in the range of 1\u20133 mmHg, as measured directly either by microelectrodes inserted into the proximal vasculature or the heart itself or through cannulation of peripheral vessels\u2014e.g. mouse46,52; chicken,22,44,61,81; frog32,42,43 and zebrafish.60,73\n\nSimultaneous measurements of both arterial blood pressure and cardiac output (typically by visualization of the cardiac dimensions during the cardiac cycle with subsequent calculation of cardiac volume changes\u2014Bagatto and Burggren3) have been made in the very early stages of zebrafish, frog and chicken embryos, and these parameters have been calculated in early mammalian embryos. Generally, the overall level of blood pressure, cardiac output, peripheral resistance and their subsequent rate of increase during the first days of heart beat are all surprisingly similar in the zebrafish,74 Xenopus,32,42,43 the bullfrog72 and the chicken.10\u201319\n\nThe physiological regulation of the heart and peripheral vessels is a key aspect of the overall mature of the cardiovascular system, but has been problematic to study in vertebrate embryos. In mammals, the embryo and then subsequently the fetus are well protected by, and deeply embedded within, the placental/uterine environment. This provides a highly nurturing environment for the developing mammal, but greatly confounds experimental measurements and manipulations. For this reason, most mammalian fetal physiology is focused on the latter phases of gestation which, in many instances, is beyond the first appearance of critical elements of cardiovascular regulation. Consequently, a great deal of what we know about the onset (as opposed to the maturation) of cardiovascular regulation has been derived from vertebrates that lay eggs or have free living larval forms, which not only makes the embryo more accessible to the researcher, but also imposes the need for early regulatory abilities to combat environmental fluctuations that are imposed directly on embryo lacking maternal mitigation.\n\nCardiovascular regulation in early embryonic stages has been explored primarily in the larvae of fishes and amphibians and in avian embryos. Typically, experiments involve the use of pharmacological agonists and agonists, which can be useful in teasing apart endocrine from neural mechanisms, and generally elucidating the onset of cardiovascular regulation. Several studies have generated embryonic \u201ctimelines\u201d that depict the first onset and subsequent maturation of adrenergic and cholinergic control of chronotropic and inotropic functions in vertebrate embryos.8,10,22 Certainly general statements can be extracted from these studies\u2014e.g. adrenergic cardiovascular regulation, as evident from cardiac neural tonus, appears before cholinergic regulation.20,22,23 Importantly, however, the detailed ontogenetic patterns of onset appear to be species-specific. From common avian modes, for example, we can see that the general mechanisms for cardiovascular regulation occur later in the chicken (Gallus gallus) than the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae, also referred to as Dromiceius novaehollandiae) (Fig. 1). Moreover, there a difference in the order of onset of functional baroreflexes, chemoreflexive cardiovascular control and the onset of vagal tonic regulation of the cardiovascular system of the chicken compared to the emu.\n\nFigure 1 Normalized developmental timeline illustrating the onset of various mechanisms for cardiovascular control in embryos of the chicken (Gallus gallus) and the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae\u2014also referred to as Dromiceius novaehollandiae). Note that both the timing and order of onset differ between the chicken and emu. After8 Full size image\n\nCardiac regulation in adults occurs through three general mechanisms: endocrine, neural, and intrinsic (Frank-Starling mechanisms, otherwise known as Starling\u2019s Law of the Heart). While the onset and maturation of endocrine and neural regulation of the cardiovascular system have been investigated, as discussed above, the maturation of intrinsic mechanisms centering around Starling\u2019s Law of the Heart remain to be explored in any detail in fetal vertebrates, and remains virtually unexplored in early vertebrate embryos. Early studies on chicken embryos and amphibian larvae have examined blood volume effects on hemodynamics (see Refs. 11,43,88 for additional references), but a study dedicated to the maturation, as opposed to the presence, of the Frank-Starling mechanism in embryo myocytes will prove highly fruitful."}, {"url": "https://accessmedicine.mhmedical.com/content.aspx?sectionid=171659456", "page_content": "+\n\n+\n\nLearning Objectives By the end of this chapter the student will be able to: Discuss the development of the heart tube.\n\nDescribe heart tube looping, chamber formation, and the series of septation that occur for the development of atria, ventricles, and great vessels.\n\nRecognize the relationship of heart tubes to the pericardial cavity.\n\nIndicate the development of valves and conducting system of the heart.\n\nDistinguish the development of the aortic arches and list its derivatives.\n\nIndicate the major changes that happened in development of the sinus venosus.\n\nList and provide a brief anatomical description of the congenital anomalies of the heart and major blood vessels.\n\nDiagram the fetal circulation and recall the changes that occur after birth.\n\n+\n\n+\n\nUnlike most other organ systems, the function of the cardiovascular system is critical for embryonic survival.

Circulation patterns are clearly established by the fourth week of embryonic life. It is critical to the survival of the developing human that the circulatory system forms early to supply the growing tissue with nutrients and gases, and to remove waste products. Blood cells and vessel production in structures outside the embryo proper called the yolk sac, chorion, and connecting stalk begin about 15 to 16 days following fertilization. Development of these circulatory elements within the embryo itself begins approximately 2 days later. You will learn more about the formation and function of these early structures when you study the chapter on development. During those first few weeks, blood vessels begin to form from the embryonic mesoderm. The precursor cells are known as hemangioblasts. These in turn differentiate into angioblasts, which give rise to the blood vessels and pluripotent stem cells, which differentiate into the formed elements of blood. (Seek additional content for more detail on fetal development and circulation.) Together, these cells form masses known as blood islands scattered throughout the embryonic disc. Spaces appear on the blood islands that develop into vessel lumens. The endothelial lining of the vessels arise from the angioblasts within these islands. Surrounding mesenchymal cells give rise to the smooth muscle and connective tissue layers of the vessels. While the vessels are developing, the pluripotent stem cells begin to form the blood.\n\nVascular tubes also develop on the blood islands, and they eventually connect to one another as well as to the developing, tubular heart. Thus, the developmental pattern, rather than beginning from the formation of one central vessel and spreading outward, occurs in many regions simultaneously with vessels later joining together. This angiogenesis\u2014the creation of new blood vessels from existing ones\u2014continues as needed throughout life as we grow and develop.\n\nBlood vessel development often follows the same pattern as nerve development and travels to the same target tissues and organs. This occurs because the many factors directing growth of nerves also stimulate blood vessels to follow a similar pattern. Whether a given vessel develops into an artery or a vein is dependent upon local concentrations of signaling proteins.\n\nAs the embryo grows within the mother\u2019s uterus, its requirements for nutrients and gas exchange also grow. The placenta\u2014a circulatory organ unique to pregnancy\u2014develops jointly from the embryo and uterine wall structures to fill this need. Emerging from the placenta is the umbilical vein, which carries oxygen-rich blood from the mother to the fetal inferior vena cava via the ductus venosus to the heart that pumps it into fetal circulation. Two umbilical arteries carry oxygen-depleted fetal blood, including wastes and carbon dioxide, to the placenta. Remnants of the umbilical arteries remain in the adult. (Seek additional content for more information on the role of the placenta in fetal circulation.)\n\nThere are three major shunts\u2014alternate paths for blood flow\u2014found in the circulatory system of the fetus. Two of these shunts divert blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circuit, whereas the third connects the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava. The first two shunts are critical during fetal life, when the lungs are compressed, filled with amniotic fluid, and nonfunctional, and gas exchange is provided by the placenta. These shunts close shortly after birth, however, when the newborn begins to breathe. The third shunt persists a bit longer but becomes nonfunctional once the umbilical cord is severed. The three shunts are as follows:\n\nThe foramen ovale is an opening in the interatrial septum that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium. A valve associated with this opening prevents backflow of blood during the fetal period. As the newborn begins to breathe and blood pressure in the atria increases, this shunt closes. The fossa ovalis remains in the interatrial septum after birth, marking the location of the former foramen ovale.\n\nis an opening in the interatrial septum that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium. A valve associated with this opening prevents backflow of blood during the fetal period. As the newborn begins to breathe and blood pressure in the atria increases, this shunt closes. The fossa ovalis remains in the interatrial septum after birth, marking the location of the former foramen ovale. The ductus arteriosus is a short, muscular vessel that connects the pulmonary trunk to the aorta. Most of the blood pumped from the right ventricle into the pulmonary trunk is thereby diverted into the aorta. Only enough blood reaches the fetal lungs to maintain the developing lung tissue. When the newborn takes the first breath, pressure within the lungs drops dramatically, and both the lungs and the pulmonary vessels expand. As the amount of oxygen increases, the smooth muscles in the wall of the ductus arteriosus constrict, sealing off the passage. Eventually, the muscular and endothelial components of the ductus arteriosus degenerate, leaving only the connective tissue component of the ligamentum arteriosum.\n\nis a short, muscular vessel that connects the pulmonary trunk to the aorta.

The ductus venosus closes slowly during the first weeks of infancy and degenerates to become the ligamentum venosum.\n\nChapter Review\n\nBlood vessels begin to form from the embryonic mesoderm. The precursor hemangioblasts differentiate into angioblasts, which give rise to the blood vessels and pluripotent stem cells that differentiate into the formed elements of the blood. Together, these cells form blood islands scattered throughout the embryo. Extensions known as vascular tubes eventually connect the vascular network. As the embryo grows within the mother\u2019s womb, the placenta develops to supply blood rich in oxygen and nutrients via the umbilical vein and to remove wastes in oxygen-depleted blood via the umbilical arteries. Three major shunts found in the fetus are the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, which divert blood from the pulmonary to the systemic circuit, and the ductus venosus, which carries freshly oxygenated blood high in nutrients to the fetal heart.\n\nCritical Thinking Questions All tissues, including malignant tumors, need a blood supply. Explain why drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors would be used in cancer treatment. Explain the location and importance of the ductus arteriosus in fetal circulation. Show Answers Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that inhibit the growth of new blood vessels. They can impede the growth of tumors by limiting their blood supply and therefore their access to gas and nutrient exchange. The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that provides a passageway between the pulmonary trunk and the aorta during fetal life. Most blood ejected from the fetus\u2019 right ventricle and entering the pulmonary trunk is diverted through this structure into the fetal aorta, thus bypassing the fetal lungs.\n\nGlossary\n\nangioblasts: stem cells that give rise to blood vessels\n\nangiogenesis: development of new blood vessels from existing vessels\n\nblood islands: masses of developing blood vessels and formed elements from mesodermal cells scattered throughout the embryonic disc\n\nductus arteriosus: shunt in the fetal pulmonary trunk that diverts oxygenated blood back to the aorta\n\nductus venosus: shunt that causes oxygenated blood to bypass the fetal liver on its way to the inferior vena cava\n\nforamen ovale: shunt that directly connects the right and left atria and helps to divert oxygenated blood from the fetal pulmonary circuit\n\nhemangioblasts: embryonic stem cells that appear in the mesoderm and give rise to both angioblasts and pluripotent stem cells\n\numbilical arteries: pair of vessels that runs within the umbilical cord and carries fetal blood low in oxygen and high in waste to the placenta for exchange with maternal blood\n\numbilical vein: single vessel that originates in the placenta and runs within the umbilical cord, carrying oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the fetal heart\n\nvascular tubes: rudimentary blood vessels in a developing fetus"}, {"url": "https://patient.info/news-and-features/anatomy-of-the-heart-and-blood-vessels", "page_content": "The heart is a muscular pump that pushes blood through blood vessels around the body.

Carbon dioxide is passed out of the body by the lungs; most of the other waste products are disposed of by the kidneys. Blood also transports heat around your body.\n\nWhere are the heart and blood vessels found?\n\nNormal heart detail\n\nThe heart is a fist-sized organ which lies within the chest behind the breastbone (sternum). The heart sits on the main muscle of breathing (the diaphragm), which is found beneath the lungs. The heart is considered to have two 'sides' - the right side and the left side.\n\nThe heart has four chambers - an atrium and a ventricle on each side. The atria are both supplied by large blood vessels that bring blood to the heart (see below for more details). Atria have special valves that open into the ventricles. The ventricles also have valves but, in this case, they open into blood vessels. The walls of the heart chambers are made mainly of special heart muscle. The different sections of the heart have to squeeze (contract) in the correct order for the heart to pump blood efficiently with each heartbeat.\n\nWhat do the heart and blood vessels do?\n\nThe heart's main function is to pump blood around the body. Blood carries nutrients and waste products and is vital to life. One of the essential nutrients found in blood is oxygen.\n\nThe right side of the heart receives blood lacking oxygen (deoxygenated blood) from the body. After passing through the right atrium and right ventricle this blood is pumped to the lungs. Here blood picks up oxygen and loses another gas called carbon dioxide. Once through the lungs, the blood flows back to the left atrium. It then passes into the left ventricle and is pumped into the main artery (aorta) supplying the body. Oxygenated blood is then carried though blood vessels to all the body's tissues. Here oxygen and other nutrients pass into the cells where they are used to perform the body's essential functions.\n\nA blood vessel's main function is to transport blood around the body. Blood vessels also play a role in controlling your blood pressure.\n\nBlood vessels are found throughout the body. There are five main types of blood vessels: arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules and veins.\n\nArteries carry blood away from the heart to other organs. They can vary in size. The largest arteries have special elastic fibres in their walls. This helps to complement the work of the heart, by squeezing blood along when heart muscle relaxes. Arteries also respond to signals from our nervous system, either tightening (constricting) or relaxing (dilating).\n\nArterioles are the smallest arteries in the body. They deliver blood to capillaries. Arterioles are also capable of constricting or dilating and, by doing this, they control how much blood enters the capillaries.\n\nCapillaries are tiny vessels that connect arterioles to venules. They have very thin walls which allow nutrients from the blood to pass into the body tissues. Waste products from body tissues can also pass into the capillaries. For this reason, capillaries are known as exchange vessels.\n\nGroups of capillaries within a tissue reunite to form small veins called venules. Venules collect blood from capillaries and drain into veins.\n\nVeins are the blood vessels that carry blood back to the heart. They may contain valves which stop blood flowing away from the heart.\n\nHow do the heart and blood vessels work?\n\nThe heart works by following a sequence of electrical signals that cause the muscles in the chambers of the heart to contract in a certain order. If these electrical signals change, the heart may not pump as well as it should.\n\nThe sequence of each heartbeat is as follows:\n\nThe sinoatrial node (SA node) in the right atrium is like a tiny in-built 'timer'. It fires off an electrical impulse at regular intervals. (About 60-80 per minute when you are resting and faster when you exercise.) This controls your heart rate. Each impulse spreads across both atria, which causes them to contract. This pumps blood through one-way valves into the ventricles.\n\nThe electrical impulse gets to the atrioventricular node (AV node) at the lower right atrium. This acts like a 'junction box' and the impulse is delayed slightly. Most of the tissue between the atria and ventricles does not conduct the impulse. However, a thin band of conducting fibres called the atrioventricular bundle (AV bundle) acts like 'wires' and carries the impulse from the AV node to the ventricles.\n\nThe AV bundle splits into two - a right and a left branch. These then split into many tiny fibres (the Purkinje system) which carry the electrical impulse throughout the ventricles. The ventricles contract and pump blood through one-way valves into large arteries: The arteries going from the right ventricle take blood to the lungs. The arteries going from the left ventricle take blood to the rest of the body.\n\nThe heart then rests for a short time (diastole). Blood coming back to the heart from the large veins fills the atria during diastole: The veins coming into the left atrium are from the lungs (full of oxygen). The veins coming into the right atrium are from the rest of the body (depleted of oxygen).\n\n\n\nThe sequence then starts again for the next heartbeat. The closing of the valves in the heart make the 'lub-dub' sounds that a doctor can hear with a stethoscope.\n\nIf you exercise, your body tissues need more oxygen and will produce more carbon dioxide. This means your heart must speed up to meet those needs. How fast your heart beats (your heart rate) is controlled in a number of different ways. The brain controls the heart rate through the nervous system. A special part of the brain, called the medulla oblongata, receives information from many different systems of the body. The brain then co-ordinates the information and either sends signals to increase or decrease the heart rate, depending on what is necessary.\n\nEven before physical activity begins, your heart may speed up in anticipation of what is to come. This is because a special part of the nervous system sends signals to the medulla. As physical activity starts, cells of the nervous system which monitor changes in the body (receptors) send signals about the position of your muscles to the brain. This can increase your heart rate.\n\nThe body also has other receptors which measure levels of chemicals, such as carbon dioxide, in your blood. If levels of carbon dioxide rise, signals are sent via the nervous system to the brain. The brain then sends electrical signals to the heart via nerves to speed it up. The signals cause the release of hormones which make the SA node fire more often. This means the heart beats more frequently. The brain can also send signals to the heart to slow it down.\n\nOther hormones, such as those from the thyroid gland, can also influence your heart rate, as can certain substances found in your blood.\n\nThe most important function of the cardiovascular system (the heart and blood vessels together) is to keep blood flowing through capillaries. This allows capillary exchange to take place. Capillary exchange is the process of nutrients passing into the body's cells and waste products passing out. Blood vessels are uniquely designed to allow this to happen.\n\nBlood leaves the heart in the larger arteries. These vessels help to propel blood, even when the heart is not beating, because they have elastic walls which squeeze the blood in them. Arterioles are smaller than arteries and provide the link between the arteries and the capillaries. Capillaries allow nutrients and waste products to move in and out of the bloodstream. Venules take blood from the capillaries to the veins. Veins take blood back to the heart. This constant circulation of blood keeps us alive.\n\nYour blood vessels also play a part in the regulation of your blood pressure. Certain chemicals in the body can cause our blood vessels either to tighten (contract) or to relax (dilate). Signals from our nervous system can also make our blood vessels relax or contract. These changes cause a change in the size of the lumen of the vessel. This is the space through which blood flows. In simple terms, constriction of blood vessels causes an increase in blood pressure. Dilation of blood vessels causes a decrease in blood pressure. However, blood vessels don't just control blood pressure by themselves. Your body controls blood pressure using a complicated system. This involves hormones, signals from your brain and nervous system and the natural responses of your blood vessels.\n\nThe blood supply to the heart\n\nLike any other muscle, the heart muscle needs a good blood supply. The coronary arteries take blood to the heart muscle. These are the first arteries to branch off the large artery (aorta) which takes blood to the body from the left ventricle.\n\nThe right coronary artery mainly supplies the muscle of the right ventricle.\n\nThe left coronary artery quickly splits into two and supplies the rest of the heart muscle.\n\nThe main coronary arteries divide into many smaller branches to supply all the heart muscle.\n\nSome disorders of the heart and blood vessels"}, {"url": "https://biologywise.com/information-about-the3-germ-layers-in-animals", "page_content": "Like it? Share it!\n\nAll animals begin life as a single-celled organism. That single cell undergoes various divisions and processes during gestation to develop into a newborn animal. The development process includes the formation of the germinal layers, which eventually give rise to the various parts of the animal.\n\nDiscovery\n\nThe three germ layers in chick embryos were first observed and reported by Heinz Christian Pander, a doctoral student at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, in 1817.\n\nAnimals, invertebrates, and vertebrates alike, start out as unicellular zygotes. The zygotes (fertilized egg cells) undergo cell divisions till they form a multicellular ball of cells called the blastula. A blastula is generally formed after the 7th cell division (cleavage) of the zygote, and consists of around 128 cells. The blastula shows cells arranged in a spherical manner called the blastoderm, encircling a fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel. As development progresses and the blastula attaches to the uterine lining, it expands and the cells form two distinct structures: the trophoblast and the inner cell mass. The trophoblast will eventually give rise to the yolk sac and the amnion, while the inner cell mass will undergo differentiation to form the embryo.\n\nBlastopore Formation\n\nAfter implantation, the blastula develops into a gastrula. The gastrulation process is characterized by the formation of a blastopore, a dorsal lip, and the archenteron. The blastopore is an opening on the surface of the blastula that opens into the blastocoel. The blastocoel is now called the archenteron, and will eventually develop into the digestive tract of the animal. The dorsal part of the blastopore is called the dorsal lip, and the cells around it later give rise to the head region of the animal. The fate of the blastopore depends on the complexity of the animals. In less complex animals (protostomes), such as molluscs and earthworms, the blastopore develops into the oral cavity or mouth, but in case of more complex animals (deuterostomes), such as humans and most vertebrates, the blastopore develops into the anal opening.\n\nFormation of Germ Layers\n\nOnce the blastopore is formed, the cells of the inner cell mass start moving along the invagination. This movement of cells is known as morphogenetic movement and includes processes such as epiboly, involution, and ingression. These processes help facilitate the movement of cells. The rearrangement of cells establish two temporary layers of cells called the hypoblast and the epiblast. The formation of the dorsal lip or primitive streak leads the epiblast to divide and differentiate into the three embryonic germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. The hypoblast later forms the amnion.\n\nThe Three Germ Layers in Animals\n\nGerm layers are the primary layers of cells that will, in due course, differentiate and develop into all the tissues and organs of the animal. The number of germ layers in animals vary depending on the body complexity.\n\nSponges\n\n\u25a3 Simple animals like sponges have only one germ layer that gives rise to the whole body.\n\nJellyfish \u2013 Cnidarian animal\n\n\u25a3 Cnidarian animals like jellyfish and hydra show the presence of two germ layers, and are hence called diploblasts. They show true tissue development and radial symmetry.\n\n\u25a3 Complex animals, ranging from flatworms to humans, show the presence of three germ layers. Hence, they are called triploblasts, and they exhibit bilateral symmetry.\n\nThe three germinal layers differentiate into the organism\u2019s body plan in response to the received chemical cues and stimuli.\n\n\u25a3 The endoderm is the innermost layer.\n\n\u25a3 The ectoderm is the outermost layer.\n\n\u25a3 The layer between these two layers is called the mesoderm.\n\nENDODERM\n\nThe endoderm layer is characterized by flattened cells that later transform into columnar cells. The cells of this layer later form the inner lining of the digestive tract, respiratory tube, and organs, such as the pancreas, liver, etc. The cells of the inner lining of glands and the tympanic cavity also arise from this layer. The cells also line the trachea, bronchi, alveoli of lungs, the urinary bladder, and a part of the urethra.\n\nThe endoderm, in humans, differentiates and forms distinct recognizable organs within the 6th week of embryonic development.\n\nMESODERM\n\nThe presence of this layer is only seen in triploblastic animals. Its presence leads to the formation of a body cavity, called the coelom, where the organs develop and grow freely.\n\nThe mesoderm further gives rise to four subtypes:\n\n\u25a3 Intermediate mesoderm\n\n\u25a3 Paraxial mesoderm\n\n\u25a3 Lateral plate mesoderm\n\n\u25a3 Chordamesoderm\n\nThese four types are formed via cell signaling and cellular interactions between the cells of the endoderm and the ectoderm.\n\nThe cells of the intermediate mesoderm give rise to the kidneys and gonads, while the lateral plate mesoderm differentiates and produces the entirety of the circulatory system including the heart, the various blood cells, blood vessels, spleen, the wall of the gut, and also the wall of the animal body. The paraxial mesoderm produces the cartilage, skeletal muscles, and the dermis. The notochord or the primitive spine of the animal develops from the differentiation of the cells of the chordamesoderm.\n\nIn general, the mesoderm is responsible for the formation of striated, skeletal, and smooth muscles, bones, cartilage, connective and adipose tissues, the lymphatic and circulatory systems, dermis, the genitourinary system, and the notochord.\n\nECTODERM\n\nThe ectoderm is responsible for the outermost layers of the embryo. It differentiates into three subtypes\n\n\u25a3 The surface ectoderm\n\n\u25a3 The neural crest\n\n\u25a3 The neural tube\n\nThe surface ectoderm differentiates to form the epidermis, hair, nails, eye lens, sebaceous glands on the skin, cornea of the eye, tooth enamel, and the epithelium of the mouth and the nose. In layman terms, this subtype gives rise to the exoskeleton of the animal. The neural tube develops to form the brain, spinal cord, the posterior pituitary gland, the motor neurons, and the retina. The anterior pituitary gland arises by the development of the ectodermal tissue of Rathke\u2019s pouch. The peripheral nervous system, adrenal medullae, melanocytes, facial cartilage, and the dentin of teeth are formed by the cells of the neural crest. The neural crest, because of its significance, is often considered as the fourth germ layer despite being a derivative of the ectoderm.\n\nThe germinal layers are responsible for giving rise to the body, in the case of all animals. Despite the varying body complexities, the general process of embryonic development stays the same at the cellular level. The characteristic physical features and attributes develop during the later stages of development."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zrrry9q/revision/2", "page_content": "Blood vessels leading into and out of the heart\n\nfrom the lungs to the heart\n\naway from the right ventricle to the lungs\n\nfrom the body back to the heart\n\nis the largest vein in the body.

He was born in Riga, Latvia, on 24 July 1794. Pander, with an eclectic history of research, is best remembered for his discovery and explanation of the structure of the chick blastoderm, a term he coined. In doing so, Pander was able to achieve the goal set forth by his teacher, Ignaz D\u00f6llinger, to reinvigorate the study of the chick embryo as a means of further exploring the science of embryology as a whole. His findings paved the way for the work of Karl Ernst von Baer, who would later revolutionize the field of embryology with his research.\n\nPander initially studied in the local schools of his hometown, Riga, and eventually enrolled in the University of Dorpat in 1812. While studying there, Pander attempted to pursue an education in both medical science as well as natural history. It was during this time that Pander began to work with an anatomist named Karl Friedrich Burdach who had previously taught Karl Ernst von Baer. Pander left Dorpat in 1814 and traveled to Germany. It was there in 1816 that Pander met von Baer, who convinced him to study at the University of W\u00fcrzburg under the tutelage of Ignaz D\u00f6llinger. Pander agreed and traveled to W\u00fcrzburg where he received his MD in 1817. It was also here that he published his dissertation, Historia Metamorphoseos Quam Ovum Incubatum Prioribus Quinque Diebus Subit, a study of the components of the chick embryo including detailed illustrations by Eduard Joseph d\u2019Alton.\n\nDuring his work at the University of W\u00fcrzburg, Pander discovered the blastoderm of the chick embryo. The blastoderm is the outermost cellular layer of the embryo, which Pander believed contributed greatly to embryonic development. He studied the blastoderm\u2019s role in early embryonic development, describing the outer, middle, and inner layers in detail while only being able to conclude that the development of blood vessels occurred in the middle layer and that important events of embryonic development followed thereafter. Despite the lack of in-depth conclusions, Pander\u2019s discovery and recognition of the blastoderm as well as the layered structure of the embryo provided invaluable information and guidance to his colleagues as well as future embryologists, including von Baer.\n\nDespite promising early research, Pander did not pursue further work in the study of chick embryos or embryology in general. After he obtained his MD and published his dissertation, Pander began traveling through Europe visiting science museums and continuing his work of observation in the fields of biology, paleontology, and geology. His primary goal in doing so was to visit and study the newest and most intricate fossils and skeletons discovered in different parts of the world. Pander eventually began to publish a series of works on osteology, the study of bones, collaborating once again with E. J. d\u2019Alton. Pander became a member of the Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg in 1821 and a member of the St. Petersburg Zoological Academy in 1826. For the remainder of his life, Pander lived mainly in his estate near his hometown of Riga while still taking time to travel and continue his work in the fields of geology and paleontology, though none of his later work gained significant recognition. Pander died on 22 September 1865 in St. Petersburg. Though somewhat inconclusive, Pander\u2019s work with chick embryos and their components marked the beginning of a more advanced understanding of embryology."}, {"url": "https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/10/4/602/35651/The-Development-of-the-Notochord-in-Chick-Embryos", "page_content": "It seemed desirable to investigate more closely the process of normal development of the chick notochord by means of light- and electron-microscope techniques in order to try to co-ordinate all that is known so far.\n\nFor the reasons given, investigations on the morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation of the chick notochord appear to be particularly interesting. In the normal developmental table of the chick prepared by Hamburger & Hamilton (1951) , which still remains the best guide for all embryological work on the development of chick embryos, the changes in the notochord are not actually taken into account, as this work was based exclusively on external characteristics. Some general information on the development of the chick notochord can be found in monographs or textbooks such as those of Waddington (1952 , 1956 ), Hamilton (1952) , and Romanoff (1960) . More detailed data based on light microscopy have been published by Kuhlenbeck (1930) and Williams (1942) .\n\nThe life-span of the notochord in birds and mammals is comparatively short. Its transient role, which is to provide rigidity of the longitudinal axis of the embryo, and its inductive potencies in cartilage formation become obsolete as soon as the definite skeleton begins to be formed. In chick embryos the whole period of development and existence of the notochord is limited to about 10 days (i.e. from the 2nd until the 11th day of embryonic life). During this period the formation of the prechordal material, its moulding into a rod-like organ, and, later, profound intracellular changes take place. The rate of the morphogenetic process, as well as the process of internal cytodifferentiation, is undoubtedly much faster in the notochord than in embryonic structures which develop more slowly but persist longer.\n\nThe literature on the notochord, a structure characteristic of all vertebrates, is very extensive, due to the phylogenetic importance of this organ, its role in early embryonic development, and its central position in the developing vertebral column. As early as 1834 the notochord tissue was described by M\u00fcller as being similar in appearance to the parenchyma of plants. Surprisingly, however, in the chick embryo, which is so widely used by embryologists, its development has not very often been the subject of descriptive or experimental investigations. From the early days most work on this fundamental organ was done on fish and amphibians, probably because the notochord in lower vertebrates is more suitable for investigations, as it persists longer, carrying out its function as an embryonic and larval skeleton.\n\nThe methacrylate sections were viewed without using electron \u2018stains\u2019, whereas the Araldite sections were contrasted either by floating, after being mounted on grids with collodion-carbon films, on potassium permanganate (1 per cent.) with uranyl acetate (2\u00b75 per cent.) solution (modification of Lawn\u2019s method, 1960 ) for 20 minutes, or mounted straight on uncovered grids (e.g. Athene, No. 483) and subsequently stained by immersing in saturated lead acetate solution in ether-absolute alcohol (1:1) for 20\u201330 minutes. The latter method proved to be the more satisfactory. Some Araldite sections were treated by floating them on 10 per cent, phosphotungstic acid solution for 15 minutes and then washed for 5 minutes ( Watson, 1958 ).\n\nIn the majority of cases ultra-thin sections were cut transversely to the longitudinal axis at the following levels: (1) In head-process and head-fold embryos, approximately in the middle of the length of the chorda-mesoblast concentration. (2) In embryos with 1\u201312 somites, at the level of the first somite or just anterior to it. (3) In older embryos in the cervical region of the notochord.\n\nAfter being fixed at about 4\u00b0 C. the embryos were dehydrated with 35, 70, and 95 per cent, alcohol (5\u201310 minutes in each), and then with three changes of absolute alcohol. Embedding was carried out either with prepolymerized methacrylate mixture after two changes of liquid methacrylate or with the final Araldite mixture after replacing the absolute alcohol by two changes of 1:2-epoxy-propane.\n\nIn preliminary investigations, a methyl-butyl methacrylate mixture proved to be unsatisfactory as an embedding medium, presumably due to its tendency to polymerization damage. All final embeddings were carried out with Araldite epoxy resin made up according to the original formula recommended by Glauert & Glauert (1958) .\n\nThe pH of the above buffer solution without osmium tetroxide is 8\u00b715. Its osmotic pressure is similar to that of the original Palade\u2019s buffer. The use of a higher pH than that recommended by Palade and other authors greatly improves the results, and so do the replacement of sodium chloride by sucrose ( Caulfield, 1957 ) and the increased percentage of osmium tetroxide ( Pease, 1960 ).\n\nFor electron-microscope examination the embryos were fixed in toto for 15\u201345 minutes, depending on age, after being dissected in Pannet-Compton\u2019s solution. As a fixative, a modified 1 or 2 per cent, osmium tetroxide solution buffered with sodium barbitone and sodium acetate was used ( Palade, 1952 ; Caulfield, 1957 ). As the original Palade buffer proved unsatisfactory, a number of modifications were tried. As a result of these technical approaches it was established that the best preservation of tissues in general, and of the notochord in particular, can be achieved by using a 2 per cent, osmium tetroxide solution made up according to the following formula:\n\nChick embryos at all developmental stages from the 5th to the 31st were obtained from Brown Leghorn eggs incubated at 38\u00b75\u00b0 C. (The stages are numbered throughout the paper according to Hamburger & Hamilton (1951) .) For histological reasons, after being dissected from the eggs while the entire yolk was immersed in Pannet-Compton\u2019s saline solution, the embryos were fixed for 1 hour in Carnoy\u2019s fluid (with chloroform), rinsed thoroughly with absolute alcohol, and, after clearing in methyl benzoate, were embedded in wax (m.p. 54\u00b0 C.). Serial transverse or sagittal sections were stained with methyl green-pyronine.\n\nAbout stage 22 mitotic divisions become gradually less frequent, although they do not disappear completely even at the latest stages under investigation. From stage 25 there begin to appear more and more frequently cells with pycnotic or karyorrhectic nuclei scattered randomly throughout the organ, foreshadowing the onset of the process of involution.\n\nAt stages later than 16 the mitotic activity of the notochordal cells appears to be still considerable (0\u00b75 per cent.), without, however, having any particular distribution. The vacuolated cells divide at the same rate, irrespective of whether the cytoplasm is more or less pyronine-positive. In such cells the chromosome sets are usually pushed by the vacuole from the centre of the cell towards the periphery. However, this does not seem to disturb the mitotic process (Plate 2, fig. 15).\n\nDuring stage 17 or 18 the notochord tissue, in sections stained with methyl green-pyronine, begins to exhibit two kinds of cells: one with the cytoplasm more pyronine-positive, and the other with paler cytoplasm. At stages 20 and 21 up to 30 per cent, of cells have the more pyronine-positive cytoplasm. These cells are mainly distributed near the periphery of the organ, although they are also present deeper within it (Plate 1, figs. 9,10). Together with the less pyronine-positive cells, these form the so-called notochord epithelium. As will be seen later, these epithelial cells do not actually differ from the cells situated deeper in the notochord tissue. The presence of these two kinds of cells in other vertebrates has been reported by several workers: in Holocephala ( Schauinsland, 1906 ), in Amniota ( Bruni, 1912 ), and in duck embryos ( Kuhlenbeck, 1930 ).\n\nAt the end of this period, usually at stage 16, the process of vacuolization of the notochord cells starts. First, intracellular vacuoles appear in the cervical region, primarily in the core of the organ (Plate 1, fig. 8), but shortly afterwards the process spreads towards the periphery of the notochord as well as in both cephalic and caudal directions. From stage 16 onwards it becomes the main feature in the cytodifferentiation of the notochord. When the process is sufficiently advanced, the appearance of vacuoles causes the above-mentioned intercellular spaces to disappear, and the \u2018pile-of-coins\u2019 arrangement is disturbed (Plate 2, fig. 14).\n\nBy stage 16 the separation of the notochord from the ventral side of the neural tube is complete in the cephalic and cervical regions, but towards the caudal end the association still persists. The separation presumably takes place because of the formation of the fibrous notochordal sheath which penetrates into the narrow space between the two organs, being followed at later stages by mesodermal cells.\n\nDuring stages 14\u201316 the notochord shows a considerable increase in its diameter, due partly to increased proliferation of cells and partly to the fact that at this period numerous intercellular spaces appear, which are located to a large extent in the centre of the organ (Plate 1, fig. 7). These intercellular spaces form small lumina of about 5\u201310 \u03bc in diameter. They are most clearly visible in sagittal sections where they appear to be interconnected, thus representing a system of small, irregular, communicating spaces (Plate 2, fig. 12).\n\nDuring the next stages (10\u201313) the increase in the size of the notochord keeps pace with the general growth of the embryo. First of all it elongates as much as is necessary. However, in spite of very frequent mitotic divisions during these stages, which now become more and more randomly distributed throughout the organ, the diameter of the notochord not only does not increase, but it even shows a slight decrease (Plate 1, fig. 6). This fact indicates that the morphogenetic changes in the notochord are due partly to an increase in the number of cells and partly to the migration of cells along the median axis. By the end of this period, i.e. at stage 13, the notochord begins to separate itself from the bottom of the neural tube. The separation occurs first at the cephalic region and then moves slowly backwards.\n\nDuring these stages dividing cells are found more frequently in the hind part of the notochord than in the cephalic region, up to 60 per cent, of them being confined to a definite region about 100 to 200 \u03bc anterior to the notochord bulb. In the rest of the organ they are scarce and distributed at random. The confinement of dividing cells to this particular region during the early stages of development explains the fact that the anterior end of the head-process moves forward only slightly, as nearly all growth in length occurs at the posterior end.\n\nAt later stages (6\u20139) the relationship of the chorda-mesoblast to the surrounding tissues changes, primarily due to its more and more marked separation from the paraxial mesoderm (Plate 1, figs. 2, 3, 4). Simultaneously, the cell-to-cell contact between the presumptive notochord cells increases, probably being, in consequence, the main cause of the transformation of the chorda-mesoblast into the true, typically rod-shaped notochord. At this stage the morphogenetic changes leading to the moulding of the definite shape proceed, due to proliferation of the cells in front of the node ( Spratt, 1947 ), from caudal to anterior. At the end of this period the notochord detaches itself from the endoderm, although it still remains closely associated with the neural plate (Plate 1, fig. 5).\n\nOn the ventral side the chorda-mesoblast condensation at this stage, as well as in a few later stages, appears to be intimately fused with the unicellular layer of the endoderm. At the median line, therefore, the endodermal cells are difficult to distinguish from the prospective notochord cells as described by Hamilton (1952) and also by Fraser (1954) in somewhat older embryos in the pharyngeal region. The unification of both tissues at the head-process stage was described by Ussow (1906) as \u2018entochorda\u2019. Laterally the endoderm is free and consists of a single layer widely separated from the paraxial mesoblast elements (Plate 1, fig. 2).\n\nThe chorda-mesoblast condensation first appears at stage 5, at a point anterior to Hensen\u2019s node, as an extension of the primitive streak along the axis, in the form of an elongated, dorso-ventrally flattened strip of loosely arranged cells (Plate 1, fig. 1). It is distinctly separated from the medullary plate throughout its entire length by a definite boundary, but at the same time it remains very closely attached to it. The contact surface between the chorda-mesoblast and the medullary plate, which appears to be very intimate, is, however, not even; at regular intervals of about 30\u201350 \u03bc along the longitudinal axis of that surface distinct indentations can be found in the medullary plate, into which notochordal cells protrude. These indentations, which continue up to stage 7, can be seen particularly well in sagittal sections. It seems that during these stages the whole chorda-mesoblast tissue is being anchored by means of these indentations to the bottom of the medullary plate (Plate 2, fig. 11).\n\nThe histological material was also used in observations on the distribution of dividing cells by counting them at early stages (5\u20139) to get more information about the mechanism of elongation and growth of the notochord.\n\nThe aim of this part of the investigations was to have a preliminary and more general look at the developmental process taking place in the notochord, as, for example, the changes in the arrangement of the cells in the course of morphogenesis of the organ. In particular, an attempt was made to re-examine the changes in the relationship of the chorda-mesoblast and, subsequently, of the notochord to the surrounding derivatives of the germ-layers, to determine the time of formation of the rod-like notochord, and to trace the vacuolization process and the subsequent appearance of the first involutive changes in the cells.\n\nIn the cytoplasm the profiles of endoplasmic reticulum elements gradually become more frequent and by stage 15 they are already numerous. Characteristic of these stages are small profiles of endoplasmic reticulum, or at least profiles of an identical structure, which can frequently be found attached to the outer nuclear membrane, which suggests the possible manner of formation of that organelle in early stages of differentiating notochord cells. Its profiles, however, are still comparatively short and wide, being limited by a single roughsurfaced membrane (Plate 3, figs. 20, 21). At later stages, when the endoplasmic reticulum profiles appear to be much more flattened and elongated, forming lake-like dilatations, they can also occasionally be found continuous with the outer nuclear membrane (Plate 4, figs. 22, 23).\n\nIn between, the terminal bars can be still found in cross-sections through some parts of the cell membranes, but they appear to be less frequent and much shorter than at earlier stages. By the end of stage 15 they have disappeared altogether.\n\nAt somewhat later stages (10\u201315), after the notochord has become rounded and taken on its rod-like shape, its tissue loses the previous intercellular spaces, the cells become polyhedral in shape and adhering closer to each other. About stage 15 the contact between the peripheral cells becomes particularly intimate, as at that stage the cells form complicated interdigitations between themselves (Plate 3, fig. 18).\n\nThe nuclei of such early cells are comparatively large, with one or several nucleolar aggregations and a double nuclear membrane. In the cytoplasm there are numerous yolk granules of all types, as described in the chick blastoderm by Bellairs (1958) . In comparison with later stages, both mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum elements are scarce. Golgi complex groups can frequently be found in such cells, as well as in the older ones, in the form of one or more separate structures per section, as parallel profiles of flat vesicles and round canaliculi (Plate 3, figs. 16, 19; Plate 6, fig. 30).\n\nDuring the earliest stages under investigation (stages 5\u20139) the cells of the chorda-mesoblast exhibit all the characteristic morphological properties of early embryonic cells. At the head-process and head-fold stages they are loosely arranged, forming a dorso-ventrally flattened, axially elongated accumulation with numerous intercellular spaces. Being more or less spherical in shape they remain attached to each other at a few limited contact points. Many of the parts of cell membranes that take part in adhesion points show, in cross-sections in electron micrographs, characteristic thickenings called terminal bars or attachment bodies (Plate 3, figs. 16, 17).\n\nWhen the vacuolization process has progressed so far that the intracellular vacuoles occupy about half of the cell volume, there are also found intercellular spaces between the cell membranes which contribute to the network pattern of the notochord tissue. They, too, are filled with an electron-transparent (also semi-liquid) substance, which undoubtedly contributes to the rigidity of the organ. During later stages these intercellular spaces widen considerably, filling gaps between adjacent cells and even forming vesicles of considerable size between the cell membranes (Plate 7, fig. 32).\n\nFinally, it has been shown that there is no period during the whole process of development of the notochord of the chick during which cell membranes do not exist, i.e. in which notochord tissue could be described as being syncytial in nature, as was frequently assumed in older papers. At all stages the notochord cells possess definite cell membranes which can easily be detected round the cells. In cross-sections the cell membranes of two adjacent cells are represented by a continuous double line.\n\nElectron-microscope observations have also confirmed that chromosome sets in dividing cells containing intracellular vacuoles are pushed away from their usual position towards the periphery of the cells by the thrust exerted by the vacuoles (Plate 7, fig. 31).\n\nBy means of electron-microscope examination of stages later than stage 20 it could be shown that the older, well-established vacuoles very often possess definitive limiting membranes separating them from the cytoplasm of the cell inside which they are found. These membranes frequently form small invaginations directed towards the lumen of the vacuole. This suggests that the vacuolar membranes are not merely interfaces between the cytoplasm and the contents of the vacuole, but that they are active in replenishing the content of the vacuoles. There are, however, also vacuoles that do not show any definite limiting membrane, passing gradually at their peripheries into the general substance of the loose cytoplasmic constituents (Plate 4, fig. 22).\n\nElectron microscopy of these two types of cells has confirmed that the distribution of the dense cells appears at first to be random, but at later stages (21\u201325) these cells are found mainly in the external layers of the notochord (i.e. in the chorda epithelium), forming groups each consisting of several such cells. However, there are always lightly stained cells between the dense ones, and dense cells can also frequently be found situated more centrally in the organ. Both kinds of cells undergo the process of vacuolization to the same degree and at the same time.\n\nThe cytoplasm of the second kind of cells (\u2018light\u2019 cells) appears to be comparatively much \u2018emptier\u2019 with, here and there, scattered profiles of endoplasmic reticulum elements and, usually attached to them, single mitochondria. Microsomal granules, which are very scarce in these cells, are confined almost exclusively to the close proximity of the limiting membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum structures (Plate 6, figs. 28, 30). The appearance of the cytoplasm of the second type of cells suggests that their low affinity to pyronine is due to the scarcity of microsomal granules.\n\nAs has already been mentioned, another feature of the cytodifferentiation of the notochordal cells is the fact that from about the 3rd day of embryonic development, i.e. from stage 17 or 18 onwards, after the vacuolization process has started, two kinds of cells can be distinguished in the notochord tissue. These differ in the stainability of their cytoplasm with pyronine. An electronmicroscope examination showed that the difference between these two types of cells is even more conspicuous than can be revealed by light microscopy. The cells described as more pyronine-positive (\u2018dark\u2019 cells) appear to have much more electron-dense cytoplasm closely packed with endoplasmic reticulum profiles, mitochondria, and Golgi complex, all spaces not containing these being packed uniformly with large numbers of microsome granules (Plate 6, figs. 28, 30).\n\nTowards the end of the vacuolization process, which is completed by about stage 26, the dilatations become smaller, and eventually, at still later stages, disappear, so that the system of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum persists only in the form of interconnected, uniformly narrow, flat cisternae, represented in sections by more or less compact, often parallelly arranged profiles (Plate 5, fig. 27). In favourable cases, when the endoplasmic reticulum of later stages has been tangentially sectioned, the ribosomes attached to their limiting membranes appear to be arranged in patterns of circular, linear, or rosette-like groups. Occasionally, branchings of the limiting membranes and fenestrae can also be found (Plate 6, figs. 28, 29).\n\nAt about stage 18 the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae start to form wide dilatations which remain continuous with the rest of the flat cisternae. In transverse sections the profiles of these dilatations appear to be lake-like structures of considerable size (up to 3 \u00b7, in diameter) connected by several tributary-like profiles of flat cisternae at their circumference (Plate 4, fig. 2; Plate 5, fig. 26). In the appearance of their contents and in their rough-surfaced membranes the dilatations are similar to the flat cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nThe topographical relationship between the nuclear membranes, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and intracellular vacuoles in the course of formation is the most characteristic feature in the cytodifferentiation of notochord cells. Later, when the vacuolization process has progressed further, the contact between the mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum persists, apparently becoming even more intimate. As the process of vacuolization proceeds, the continuity between the outer nuclear membranes and the endoplasmic reticulum seems to be much less frequent, but in spite of this the endoplasmic reticulum system develops further in the cytoplasm, so that at stages later than 18 it extends throughout the whole cytoplasm, forming a complicated and highly convoluted complex of flat cisternae with abundant ribosomes attached to their surface (Plate 4, fig. 23).\n\nIt is probable that the endoplasmic reticulum also takes part in the process of yolk utilization, as yolk granules, when in course of digestion, are also at least partly surrounded by profiles of endoplasmic reticulum.\n\nAt stage 16, when the vacuolization of the cytoplasm begins, small vacuoles in the course of formation are frequently found to be surrounded by one or more profiles of the endoplasmic reticulum (Plate 5, fig. 24). At the same time other fragments remain often in close proximity to single mitochondria. The connexions between them, particularly at later stages, are often provided by socket-like depressions formed by endoplasmic reticulum cysternae which embrace the mitochondria (fig. 25).\n\nJust prior to the formation of the cartilage tissue in the vertebral column, i.e. at stage 21, there is formed externally to both layers of the fibrous sheath a third layer, consisting of mesodermal cells of sclerotomal origin. In the proximity of the fibrous sheath its cells are flattened and closely applied to the surface in parallel rows.\n\nThe fine structure of the notochord sheath microfibrils, particularly in later stages, in spite of slight affinity to phosphotungstic acid, do not exhibit the characteristic periodic structure of collagen fibres. They are about 200 A thick and appear to be formed by 2\u20134 rows of fine granules 30\u201350 A in diameter. The microfibrils form a network whose prevailing arrangement is parallel to the outline of the notochord, with numerous transverse branchings between the concentric fibres (Plate 8, fig. 38).\n\nFrom stage 22 onwards the notochord sheath begins to be composed of two layers which in cross-section form two concentric zones: an external, denser layer which is undoubtedly the older one deposited on the surface of the notochord from the outside, and an inner, much narrower layer, also fibrous, but less dense, probably produced by the notochordal cells and deposited from the inside (Plate 8, fig. 36). This suggestion is supported by three facts. Firstly, the inner layer appears much later than the outer. Secondly, in the period during which the inner layer is formed some kind of fibrous material similar to that of the sheath can be found inside the peripheral cell of the notochord, usually deposited close to the outer cell membranes (Plate 8, fig. 37). Thirdly, when the two layers described above have been formed, a fibrous boundary is found between them which is probably identical with the internal membrane formed by microfibrils on the surface of the notochord at earlier stages, but due to the formation of the internal layer from inside, this membrane forms now a boundary between the layers.\n\nAt older stages (18-22) the density of the microfibrils increases considerably and the whole structure becomes thicker. The internal membrane of the sheath formed on the surface of the notochord now appears to be continuous and exactly parallel to the peripheral membranes (Plate 8, fig. 35).\n\nCommencing from the stages in which the notochord becomes definitely shaped into an elongated, round, rod-like organ, i.e. from stage 11 onwards, there begins to be formed outside the organ an extracellular membrane named the perichordal sheath. This appears gradually, first as a thin deposition of loose, fibrous elements close to the external surface of the notochord (Plate 8, fig. 33). Very soon, however, at the close proximity to the notochord surface the microfibrils become so dense that they form a delicate membrane (Plate 8, fig. 34). On the other hand, the accumulation of microfibrils from the very beginning of its formation, and also at all later stages, is devoid of any limiting outer membrane. Moreover, the microfibrils are more thinly scattered farther away from the notochord in the ambient intercellular spaces between the perichordal mesenchyme cells.\n\nIt must be emphasized that this pinocytic activity coincides in time with the onset of the vacuolization process, when water requirements become critical. Pinocytosis, together with the diffusion of water through the cell membranes, may be the process which enables this requirement to be satisfied, as the notochord itself always remains avascular.\n\nThroughout the period of vacuolization, i.e. from stage 15 onwards, there are present in the outer cell membranes, limiting the organ from outside, small in-vaginated vesicles, usually with narrow bottle-neck connexions. These vesicles are formed presumably by the pinocytic activity of the cell membranes. Similar vesicles (pinosomes) can also be seen deeper in the cytoplasm, suggesting that after being formed by the cell membrane they are taken inwards by the cytoplasm (Plate 8, figs. 34, 39).\n\nLight and electron microscopy of the early stages (up to stage 8) show that in the chick the notochord tissue is formed by loosely arranged cells, the areas of contact between the contiguous cells being only limited. These contact points are often reinforced by so-called terminal bars outside which there are extensive intercellular spaces. Soon afterwards the cell-to-cell contact increases, intercellular gaps gradually disappear, and the terminal bars are replaced by adhesion of the entire cellular membranes of adjacent cells. These changes coincide in time with the morphogenetical progress in formation of the cylindrical rod-like notochord. Virtually the same changes in roughly corresponding stages have been observed in urodele notochords by Waddington & Perry (1962). It seems therefore that the subsequent increase of the cell-to-cell contact is generally the morphogenetic factor in the process of moulding the notochord into its definite cylindrical shape.\n\nAccording to Spratt\u2019s marking experiments (1957) the elongation of the notochord in the early stages of development is accomplished mainly by the addition of cells originally situated posterior to the chorda bulb, and only to a lesser extent by mitotic activity. He emphasizes that the region of maximum elongation is just anterior to the notochord bulb, but concludes that it is mainly due to migration of cells from behind. In the present investigations, however, it was shown that in the region just anterior to the bulb there are confined about 60 per cent, of the total number of dividing cells, and presumably this indicates that elongation takes place here mainly due to mitotic division.\n\nThe light-microscope observations reported in the present paper did not aim at confirming what is known, but were intended to serve as a preliminary guide to more detailed investigations by means of the electron microscope. In general they are in agreement with those of Kuhlenbeck (1930), but in certain details there are differences to which attention should be drawn.\n\nKuhlenbeck, who worked mainly on duck eggs, describes in the notochords of 48-to 72-hour-old embryos round lumina with sharp edges which are situated centrally inside the organ. Similar lumina have been reported in the notochords of the grass snake and the owl (Ussow, 1906), as well as in human embryos (Johnson, 1917).\n\nIn the material used in the present work no such lumina were observed. However, at stages 14\u201316 there were found numerous intercellular spaces, mostly located centrally, which appear to form an interconnected system. They are, however, small and irregular in shape, and never form the round, wider lumina with sharp edges described in other species.\n\nIn duck notochords about 90 hours old Kuhlenbeck observed scattered cells with elongated nuclei and denser cytoplasm situated near the periphery of the organ. These cells are presumably identical to the more pyronine-positive cells in the chick, although in the chick these cells can be found not only at the periphery but also deeper within the organ, forming groups consisting of up to 20 cells.\n\nIn older papers dealing with investigations on the development of notochord tissue carried out by means of light microscopy, it is often accepted that this tissue undergoes a cyclic process of transformation. According to this view, the notochord starts to develop as a population of single cells, then becomes syncytial, especially in its internal part, and finally ends up as a true tissue again. This belief was formulated for the first time by Williams (1908), and since then it has been repeated many times (Bruni, 1912; Kuhlenbeck, 1930; Dawes, 1930; and others). More recently, however, Kocher (1957) expressed himself less decisively about this when describing the normal development of the notochord in Triton alpestris.\n\nBy means of electron-microscope resolution, the cell-walls can now be followed, at least in chick embryos, throughout the whole period of the development and differentiation of the notochord. Even at the stages when vacuolization reaches its maximum and the tissue is being transformed into a network-patterned \u2018gelatinous body\u2019, the individual cytoplasmic bridges (trabeculae) appear to consist of at least two parts longitudinally separated by the cell membranes belonging to the two adjacent cells. These cell boundaries can be traced as they go round individual, enormously vacuolated cells. The same fact was also reported by Leeson & Leeson (1958) in the case of the rabbit notochord, so that it seems feasible to conclude on the basis of electron-microscope observations that notochord tissue is not syncytial in nature at any period of its development. On the contrary, it is always a tissue consisting of well-separated, individual cells.\n\nRegarding the cytodifferentiation process which results in the formation of the gelatinous network structure, due to far-reaching vacuolization of cells, it can be assumed on the basis of the present findings that the main cell organelles taking part in it are the nuclear membranes, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the mitochondria. It seems to be established that about stage 15 the nuclear membrane forms at least part of the existing endoplasmic reticulum, and even at later stages connexions between these two can be found. This has been observed in the chick by Duncan (1957b) and also in the amphibian notochord, where Waddington & Perry (1962) distinguish two types of ergastoplasm which appear one after another in the course of the development of the organ, the latter being much better developed in the peripheral cells lying just under the notochord sheath. In the chick notochord, however, there was no evidence for postulating the existence of two separate types. In early stages of development these intracellular structures originate, at least partly, from the outer nuclear envelopes, whereas later it develops independently in the cytoplasm.\n\nIn the chick the endoplasmic reticulum seems to take a direct part in the formation of vacuoles, as its profiles are found to surround small vacuoles at the time of their first appearance. At the same time the endoplasmic reticulum remains in very close contact with the mitochondria, both during the process of vacuolization and later, after the maximal stage of vacuolization has been reached. It is interesting that a similar topographical relationship between the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria has been found in a quite different but also highly active tissue, namely intensely regenerating rat liver (Bernhard & Rouiller, 1956). It seems reasonable to assume that the endoplasmic reticulummitochondria system is responsible for, or at least takes part in, the physiological processes of biologically intensively active cells, especially those in the course of differentiation. This opinion was expressed also by Palade (1956). The role of the endoplasmic reticulum in differentiating cells was extensively discussed also by Waddington & Perry (1962).\n\nAnother feature of the chick notochord cells during the first and most active period of differentiation is the formation of extensive dilatations of the otherwise flat cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. As far as the author is aware, such dilatations have not been described so far in any other normal tissue, although a similar feature was noticed in plasma cells (Thiery, 1960) and in human chordoma cells investigated by means of the electron microscope (Friedmann, 1961).\n\nIn the literature there are numerous descriptions of the formation of the perichordal sheath, but views on its origin differ considerably. Until now it has been regarded, in the chick, as consisting of two layers: an internal membraneous and fibrillar layer, and an external layer built up of flattened mesodermal cells (Romanoff, 1960).\n\nWhen tracing the morphogenesis of the fibrous sheath on electron micrographs at different stages in the chick one is inclined to assume that in the beginning the fibrous sheath is produced outside the notochord as a thin layer consisting of microfibrils arranged randomly but in greater density towards the surface of the organ. Identical single microfibrils can be found at the same time scattered in the surrounding intercellular spaces between the mesenchymal cells. This situation can be attributed to the fact that the microfibrils being produced by the mesodermal cells are subsequently attracted by some unknown force towards the surface of the notochord. However, the other possibility cannot be excluded, as the microfibrils are denser at the surface of the notochord and less dense away from it.\n\nLater, from stage 21 onwards, the electron-microscope investigations seem to throw more light on this complicated problem, showing that underneath the previous single fibrous sheath there appears another one, also fibrous but consisting of less densely packed microfibrils. Considering the fact that both layers are separated at these stages by an irregular fibrous boundary, it can be assumed that the later formed inner layer originates, after all, from the notochord cells. This view is supported by the fact that at the time of the appearance of the inner layer there are often found in the cytoplasm of the notochord epithelium cells dense masses of some kind of fibrous material which might be the source from which the microfibrils of the internal zone are formed.\n\nA rather similar interpretation was suggested by Tretjakoff (1927) to explain the formation of the amphibian notochord sheath. According to Waddington & Perry (1962), however, the formation of the notochord sheath in Urodela seems to differ considerably from that described here in the chick. In the chick the sheath never comes to be fully developed into a well-defined membraneous hollow cylinder. Also, the arrangement of the microfibrils is never so regularly concentric in the chick. On the other hand, in both cases there is an indication of two different layers in the sheath, and the material for the inner layer is presumably produced by the peripheral cells of the notochord.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that the chick notochord and probably the notochords of all vertebrates are organs that never become vascularized. This detail is seldom emphasized, although it is of great importance. In the classical work of Sabin (1917) on the primitive blood-vessels in chick embryos there is in fact no indication of the existence of blood-vessels which would, during development, penetrate towards the notochord tissue. The notochord is also not vascularized in rabbit embryos (Leeson & Leeson, 1958)."}, {"url": "https://handwiki.org/wiki/Biography:Heinz_Christian_Pander", "page_content": "Short description : Baltic German geologist\n\nHeinz Christian Pander, also Christian Heinrich Pander (24 July [O.S. 13] 1794 \u2013 22 September [O.S. 10] 1865), was a Russian Empire ethnic Baltic German biologist and embryologist.\n\nBiography\n\nIn 1817 he received his doctorate from the University of W\u00fcrzburg, and spent several years (1827\u20131842), performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (German: Zarnikau)[1] on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga.

At the turn of the twentieth century, tissue grafting and explant culturing methods were developed that finally permitted scientists to functionally test the roles of different embryonic tissues (Oppenheimer 1940). Vogt\u2019s fate map made it possible to correctly interpret these experiments, since it is necessary to understand how tissues behave in their normal locations before trying to understand how they behave when placed in an abnormal environment. These embryological experiments demonstrated the source of signals that induce the germ layers, and showed that these signals act before gastrulation.\n\n7.5.1 Amphibians\n\n7.5.1.1 The Organizer\n\nAs a part of her doctoral thesis under Hans Spemann (1869\u20131941), Hilde Proescholdt (later Mangold) (1898\u20131924) worked with embryos from two differently pigmented species of salamander. She transplanted the dorsal lip of the blastopore from one embryo onto the ventral side of a host embryo. The dorsal lip is the site where gastrulation initiates in amphibians, and is visible as a small region of darkly pigmented cells at the margin. These experiments were particularly challenging because she could only obtain embryos from natural mating of a species that had only one mating season a year, and in the pre-antibiotic era, the operated embryos did not survive very well in the pond water she used to incubate her embryos (Hamburger 1984). She repeated the experiment several hundred times over the course of 2 years in order to obtain the six survivors that formed the basis of her Nobel prize winning paper (Spemann and Mangold 1924). The grafted tissue induced an entire secondary body axis. The transplant differentiated into notochord, muscle and some gut, and the overlying host cells adopted neural fates (Spemann and Mangold 1924). The mesoderm of the dorsal lip is sufficient to induce the overlying ectoderm to form neural tissue, and to organize an entire secondary body axis. Spemann called this tissue the Organizer, and laid out three characteristics that functionally define organizer tissue. The Organizer tissue should induce neural tissue from na\u00efve ectoderm, self-differentiate into notochord and prechordal plate, and reprogram surrounding tissue within the mesoderm.\n\n7.5.1.2 Mesoderm Induction\n\nJohannes Holtfreter (1901\u20131992) used a different approach to determine how the germ layers interact to produce the embryo. He developed culturing conditions that decreased the incidence of bacterial infection of operated embryos (Holtfreter 1929). He found that when raised in particular salt conditions, amphibian embryos gastrulate abnormally, such that the mesoderm and endoderm egress from the embryo instead of internalizing and migrating underneath the prospective ectoderm (Holtfreter 1933). In these exogastrulae, the mesoderm never underlies the ectoderm, and the neural plate never forms. He also performed explant studies, in which he removed cells of the animal cap from the blastula, and cultured them in his solution. The caps quickly healed into round spheres, but only differentiated into \u201catypical ectoderm\u201d (Fig. 7.6a) (Holtfreter 1938a, 1938b). This was surprising because, according to Vogt\u2019s fate map, some of the cells he explanted would become neural tissue if left in its original location. The Organizer experiment, Holtfreter\u2019s exogastrulae and the animal cap explants all showed that mesodermal tissue interacts with the ectoderm to generate the neural plate. This interaction was termed \u201cinduction\u201d because it involved communication between the germ layers and was presumably mediated by the transfer of an unknown molecule. More broadly, these experiments, along with others, showed that germ layer identity is not fixed before gastrulation, and they confirmed Pander\u2019s belief that interactions between the germ layers are essential for normal embryonic development.\n\nFig. 7.6 Experiments to find the mesoderm inducing signals in Xenopus. (a) Animal cap explants differentiate into atypical epidermis when cultured alone, but form mesoderm in combination with vegetal cells, or with mesoderm-inducing factors. (b) The Three Signal Model hypothesizes that there are three mesoderm-inducing activities in frogs: The first signal induces dorsal mesoderm (black arrow) in animal caps, the second signal induces ventral and ventrolateral mesoderm (yellow arrows) in animal caps, while the third signal dorsalizes ventral mesoderm in Ventral Marginal Zone (VMZ) explants (white arrows) (Dale and Slack 1987b) Full size image\n\nThe first indication that ectodermal cells could be induced to form mesodermal and endodermal tissue, came from experiments in which differentiated tissues from adult guinea pigs were implanted into newt gastrulae, or cultured in sandwiches between two ectodermal explants (Toivonen 1953; Takata and Yamada 1960; Saxen et al. 1964). Two important conclusions were drawn from these results. First, they showed that in the proper environment, presumptive ectoderm could be converted to the other germ layers. Secondly, they showed that some tissues produced instructive signals that could change the fate of ectoderm. This raised the possibility that such interactions occur during normal development to form the germ layers. Pieter Nieuwkoop (1917\u20131996) devised an experiment to identify the source of the endogenous mesoderm inducing signals. In a variation on Holtfreter\u2019s explant experiments, he explanted animal caps and vegetal pieces from salamander embryos and grew them either separately or in combination (Nieuwkoop 1969). He found that neither the animal caps nor the vegetal pieces were able to form mesoderm when grown separately, but mesoderm was present when the vegetal pieces were grown in combination with the animal caps (Fig. 7.6a). In salamanders, mesodermal tissue was derived exclusively from cells in the pigmented animal cap ectoderm (Nieuwkoop 1969). Similar results were obtained in Xenopus laevis (Nakamura et al. 1970). These experiments identified the vegetal pole as the likely source of the endogenous mesoderm inducing signals, although Nakamura cautioned that \u201c\u2018mesodermal induction\u2019, meaning the conversion of presumptive ectoderm into mesoderm, is an abnormal phenomenon\u201d which is only suggestive of the process that occurs in normal development (p. 318) (Nakamura et al. 1970).\n\n7.5.1.3 The Nieuwkoop Center\n\nA series of more spatially and temporally refined recombination experiments showed that the vegetal cells contained at least two types of inductive signals, and that these signals act before gastrulation. Dorsally located vegetal cells were able to induce ectodermal cells to become notochord, a dorsal mesodermal structure, with high frequency, but could only rarely induce ectoderm to form blood, which is derived from the ventral mesoderm. Ventral vegetal cells were able to induce ventral and intermediate mesodermal cell types easily, but could only rarely induce notochord (Dale et al. 1985; Dale and Slack 1987b). A series of heterochronic recombinants showed that vegetal pieces from young embryos could not act on gastrula-stage explants, but that gastrula stage vegetal pieces could act on younger ectoderm (Dale et al. 1985). This showed that the vegetal pieces continue to produce the mesoderm-inducing signal after gastrulation, but that the ectoderm loses the competence to respond to these signals. The dorsal mesoderm inducing activity was further localized to the dorsal-most vegetal cells of a 64-cell stage embryo, and its descendants (Gimlich and Gerhart 1984). When transplanted to the ventral side of a host, these cells could induce a full body axis, like the Organizer. Unlike the organizer, however, these cells did not contribute any cells to the axis itself and differentiated into gut endoderm. This region of the embryo was named the Nieuwkoop Center, in honor of the man who discovered the mesoderm-inducing capacity of cells in the vegetal pole (Gerhart et al. 1989). The Nieuwkoop center does not form in embryos treated with UV light during the first cell cycle, and all cells in resulting embryos adopt ventral fates (Gimlich and Gerhart 1984). Thus, the Nieuwkoop center is both necessary and sufficient to induce overlying cells in the embryo margin to become the Organizer .\n\n7.5.1.4 The Three-Signal Model\n\nA third inducing activity was uncovered by experiments that recombined the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) with the ventral marginal zone (VMZ). In these experiments, the tissue was explanted after mesoderm had been specified, just before the onset of gastrulation. When explanted at this stage and grown in isolation, the VMZ generates ventral mesodermal cell types, such as blood and mesothelium, but does not produce notochord and generates only a little muscle. By contrast, when combined with the DMZ, cells from the VMZ differentiate into muscle at a high frequency and no longer produce blood or mesothelium (Slack and Forman 1980; Smith and Slack 1983; Dale and Slack 1987b). The DMZ is the site of the Organizer, and was already known to induce neural tissue from ectoderm. These experiments showed that the DMZ contains another activity that acts to \u201cdorsalize\u201d presumptive ventral mesoderm so that it produces a more dorsal mesodermal cell type than it would in isolation. These results suggested the Three Signal Model for mesoderm formation (Fig. 7.6b) (Dale and Slack 1987b). According to this view, a signal from the dorsal vegetal cells induces the overlying marginal cells to adopt dorsal mesodermal fates (Fig. 7.6b, black arrow), including the notochord, while a second signal from the ventral vegetal cells induces overlying cells to adopt ventral mesodermal fates, including blood and pronephros (Fig. 7.6b, yellow arrows). At a subsequent stage, signals from the DMZ dorsalize other marginal cells to adopt dorsolateral mesodermal cell fates, like muscle (Fig. 7.6b, white arrows). These experiments only tested the functional activity of the signals produced by vegetal cells and did not clarify the molecular nature of the signals. The three activities could be explained by one molecule acting in a gradient, with different effects at different concentrations, or by multiple molecules acting synergistically to induce different fates.\n\n7.5.2 Teleosts\n\n7.5.2.1 The Embryonic Shield\n\nIt quickly became apparent that embryonic induction was not restricted to amphibian embryos. Several lines of evidence indicated that the teleost embryonic shield is the functional equivalent of Spemann\u2019s Organizer. Working in the yellow perch, Oppenheimer transplanted the embryonic shield from one embryo into ectopic locations in the blastoderm or yolk of a host embryo (Oppenheimer 1934a). She stained the host and graft with different color vital dyes, and found that the grafted shield self-differentiated into notochord and somites, and induced neighboring host cells to form a secondary neural axis, like Spemann and Mangold had observed in salamanders a decade earlier. Similar results were obtained in subsequent transplant experiments with shields from killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus), trout, zebrafish, and medaka embryos (Oppenheimer 1934b, 1936c; Luther 1935; Shih and Fraser 1996; Inohaya et al. 1999). Conversely, neural tissue failed to form when the prospective neural ectoderm of a trout embryo was extirpated and grafted onto the yolk, far from any inductive signals of the shield (Luther 1936). The shield is necessary and sufficient to induce neural tissue from na\u00efve ectoderm and the shield fulfills Spemann\u2019s definition of an organizer tissue.\n\nOppenheimer went one step further and showed that amphibian cells could respond to signals from the shield (Oppenheimer 1936b). She implanted the shield of a zebrafish embryo into the blastocoel of a newt embryo. In the resulting chimeras, the zebrafish tissue differentiated into a notochord and somites, as expected, and the amphibian host cells surrounding this graft formed ectopic neural tissue. This striking result showed that the inductive signals themselves were likely to be conserved between amphibians and teleosts.\n\n7.5.2.2 The YSL\n\nEarly experiments to determine the role of the yolk during teleost development yielded ambiguous results. The great geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan (1866\u20131945) was the first person to perform a systematic experimental analysis of teleost development, working with wrasse, sea bass, and killifish embryos at the Marine Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts (Morgan 1893, 1895). He used a needle to poke a hole in the vegetal pole of the embryo, opposite the blastodisc, gently squeezed out the yolk, and permitted the sac to backfill with seawater. He concluded that, \u201cThe yolk may be removed from the egg of Fundulus at almost any stage of development and the embryo still forms.\u201d (p. 809) (Morgan 1893). The caveat to this conclusion was that embryonic development ceased if he removed more than two-thirds of the yolk content. Morgan viewed the yolk as a passive structure, important only for the mechanics of embryonic cleavages and epiboly. Oppenheimer reinvestigated the role of the yolk in killifish, with a full understanding of embryonic induction (Oppenheimer 1936a). Her approach was to remove the entire blastoderm from the yolk at different stages and to grow them as isolates in culture. Blastoderms isolated after the 32-cell stage produced embryos with structures from all three germ layers, although they typically lacked posterior structures. Blastoderms isolated before this stage formed a hollow ball of epidermis reminiscent of the atypical ectoderm formed in Holtfreter\u2019s animal cap explants. Oppenheimer concluded that the yolk syncytial layer (YSL), which she called the periblast, contains a substance that is transferred to the blastoderm at or before the 32-cell stage, and is necessary for formation of the mesoderm and endoderm. Similar results were obtained from cultures of isolated goldfish, trout, medaka and zebrafish blastoderms (Fig. 7.6a) (Tung et al. 1954; Devillers 1961; Hyodo et al. 1996; Sagerstrom et al. 1996; Xu et al. 2014b). These transplant experiments were often difficult to interpret, given differences in staging, and whether or not a bit of the YSL had been included in the blastoderm isolates. Conclusive proof that molecules produced in the yolk are essential for embryonic development came from experiments in which RNase was injected into the YSL of zebrafish embryos (Fig. 7.7a) (Chen and Kimelman 2000). This treatment had dramatic consequences, and the embryos died before gastrulation, failing to express the earliest markers for mesoderm and endoderm. Since zebrafish embryos lacking mesoderm and endoderm survive perfectly well for days, it is likely that the RNase treatment affected a number of different processes that are vital for survival past early embryonic stages .\n\nFig. 7.7 Experiments to find the mesoderm inducing signals in zebrafish. (a) Zebrafish animal cap explants differentiate into epidermis when cultured alone, but express mesodermal markers when cultured on a free yolk cell (Ober and Schulte-Merker 1999). In untreated embryos, cells near the margin express the pan-mesodermal marker, No-tail/Xbra. No-tail/Xbra expression is greatly reduced when RNase is injected into the YSL, and an ectopic no-tail/Xbra appears when an ectopic yolk cell is grafted on the animal pole of a host embryo. (b) Signals from the YSL induce mesoderm and endoderm (small black arrows), and signals from the dorsal YSL induce dorsal mesoderm and endoderm (large black arrow) Full size image\n\nA complementary set of experiments demonstrated that signals from the yolk can induce mesoderm and endoderm. In a series of heterochronic transplants, old blastoderms with visible shields were replaced with younger blastoderms, lacking shields. As development proceeded, the transplanted blastoderms always developed shields in the same location as the original blastoderm (Long 1983). In zebrafish, animal cap cells expressed markers of mesendoderm, including the shield, when they were directly exposed to the YSL in grafting experiments (Fig. 7.6a) (Mizuno et al. 1996; Ober and Schulte-Merker 1999; Rodaway et al. 1999). Because the yolk cell cannot be further physically subdivided, specific regional capabilities of the YSL have not been addressed by grafting experiments. Targeted knockdown of specific genes in the YSL, however, indicates that it expresses an essential ventralizing signal in addition to its ability to induce dorsal mesoderm (Fan et al. 2007; Sun et al. 2014). Thus in teleosts, the extraembryonic YSL performs the same functions during development that are fulfilled by the vegetal blastomeres in amphibians (Fig. 7.7b). The YSL fits all the criteria for Nieuwkoop Center. Signals from the YSL are both necessary and sufficient to induce the shield, and the YSL does not contribute to the embryonic axis, since it is an extraembryonic tissue .\n\n7.5.3 Amniotes\n\n7.5.3.1 The Node\n\nThe functional equivalent of Spemann's Organizer in amniotes is called the node. In 1875, Viktor Hensen (1835\u20131924) was studying the embryonic development of the rabbit when he noticed an epithelial thickening at the anterior end of the primitive streak in gastrulating embryo (Hensen 1876). Because of its appearance, he called this structure the node, although in some texts it is referred to as the primitive knot. This structure, now called Hensen\u2019s node, was subsequently discovered in all gastrulating mammalian and avian embryos. Hensen observed that a bridge of invaginating mesoderm at the node connects the hypoblast to the epiblast. This unusual feature suggested to him that the node plays an important role in germ layer formation, but it would take nearly 60 years before experimental embryologists began to decipher its functions. After its discovery, biologists presumed the node was an embryonic growth zone (Leikola 1976). This changed when Vogt\u2019s vital dye staining technique was used to trace the cell movements in the chicken epiblast (Wetzel 1925, 1929; Gr\u00e4per 1929). These studies revealed that the cells of the epiblast migrate in an arc-like pattern toward the midline where they converge and invaginate in the streak and node. Later fate maps, using the more reliable lipophilic lineage tracers DiI and DiO, confirmed these observations (Hatada and Stern 1994). The node and primitive streak, therefore, are the sites where the germ layers form as the presumptive mesoderm and endoderm internalize. Rather than being a static structure, the node is composed of a highly dynamic cell population of endoderm and mesoderm precursors, equivalent to the teleost shield and the amphibian dorsal lip.\n\nEarly grafting experiments showed that the node and anterior primitive streak have the ability to self-differentiate when transplanted to the chorioallantoic membrane (Hunt 1931; Willier and Rawles 1931). Conrad H. Waddington (1905\u20131975) developed a technique for culturing chicken and duck blastoderms on a blood clot in a watch glass, with all the yolk removed (Waddington 1932). With this method, he could visualize development continuously for a period of days after various experimental manipulations. His first report describes 650 different operations. In one set of experiments, the epiblast was divided into pieces that were cultured separately. Only sections containing the node and anterior streak could produce embryonic organs such as the neural plate, notochord, heart and liver. This suggested that the node was essential for axis formation. Waddington next inserted pieces of the primitive streak underneath the epiblast of a cultured blastoderm. Anterior streak and node, but not the posterior streak, could induce the overlying epiblast to form a secondary body axis. Furthermore, nodal tissue from a duck could induce a secondary axis in a chicken epiblast, and vice versa (Waddington and Schmidt 1933). A limitation of these experiments is that they relied exclusively on morphological criteria to distinguish host tissue from graft because the vital dyes did not label tissue with sufficient intensity to be visible in sections, and because duck tissue was indistinguishable from chicken tissue under the microscope (Waddington 1932). Waddington was cautious in his conclusions, but his results were replicated much later using modern tissue labeling methods and quail-chick xenografts (Storey et al. 1992; Psychoyos and Stern 1996). These experiments show that the amniote node meets Spemann\u2019s definition of an organizer tissue. The mouse node can also induce a secondary neural axis in grafting experiments, indicating that organizer activity is a property common to the node in all amniote embryos (Beddington 1994).\n\nA series of xenograft experiments showed that zebrafish and Xenopus blastulae respond to signals from the chicken and mouse nodes (Kintner and Dodd 1991; Blum et al. 1992; Hatta and Takahashi 1996). Similarly, the rabbit node can induce neural ectoderm in chicken embryo (Waddington 1937). The conserved activities of these tissues suggested that the signals themselves were likely to be conserved among all vertebrates. This was confirmed when Chordin and Noggin were identified as the endogenous, neural inducing, and dorsalizing signals expressed in the amphibian Organizer, teleost shield, and amniote node (Smith and Harland 1992; Sasai et al. 1994; Connolly et al. 1997; Fisher et al. 1997; Schulte-Merker et al. 1997; Streit et al. 1998; Furthauer et al. 1999; Bachiller et al. 2000).\n\n7.5.3.2 Koller\u2019s Sickle/PMZ\n\nIt has been more challenging to identify the equivalent of the Nieuwkoop center in amniotes than in other phyla, mostly due to the more complicated anatomy of the blastoderm. Attention has focused on three extraembryonic tissues: the hypoblast, Koller\u2019s sickle and the posterior marginal zone (PMZ). The location of the hypoblast underneath the epiblast is reminiscent of the location of the vegetal blastomeres under the marginal zone of amphibians. Waddington was the first to test the capacity of the hypoblast to induce mesoderm, working in chicken and duck embryos (Waddington 1932, 1937). He separated the hypoblast from the epiblast, rotated the it 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 along the anteroposterior axis, recombined the pieces and grew them in culture. In all cases, the primitive streak developed abnormally, and sometimes secondary primitive streak and body axis formed with its polarity coordinated with that of the rotated endoderm. Although this result was suggestive, the lack of adequate lineage-tracing techniques meant that Waddington could not definitively conclude that the formation of a new node and streak was due to an inductive event. More recent experiments used lineage labels to unambiguously demonstrate that the node is induced, but have variously identified Koller\u2019s sickle, the PMZ, and the hypoblast as the inductive tissue (Azar and Eyal-Giladi 1979; Eyal-Giladi et al. 1992; Callebaut and Van Nueten 1994; Khaner 1998; Callebaut et al. 2003). For instance, a secondary body axis forms when a square piece of tissue from the PMZ including Koller\u2019s sickle, is grafted orthogonally to the endogenous PMZ (Fig. 7.8a) (Khaner and Eyal-Giladi 1989; Eyal-Giladi et al. 1992). Subsequent experiments found that Koller\u2019s sickle alone could not induce a primitive streak (Khaner 1998). Furthermore, detailed fate mapping showed that cells in Koller\u2019s sickle contribute to the axial mesoderm (Bachvarova et al. 1998). These results eliminated the sickle from consideration as the Nieuwkoop Center. PMZ dissected from a chicken or duck embryo in the absence of Koller\u2019s sickle can induce a primitive streak and body axis when grafted to an epiblast (Fig. 7.8a) (Bachvarova et al. 1998; Khaner 1998). Importantly, labeled cells in the graft did not contribute to the new body axis, indicating that the avian PMZ expresses signals that induce formation of the primitive streak near the marginal zone, which is comprised of future mesoderm and endodermal cells (Fig. 7.8b, large arrows). Similar grafting experiments have not been performed in mammals, but genetic studies in the mouse demonstrated that signals from the extraembryonic visceral endoderm (VE) are required to induce the node and primitive streak (Varlet et al. 1997). Thus, the avian PMZ and the mammalian VE are functionally equivalent and meet the criteria of the Nieuwkoop center. As the primitive streak extends and the node migrates toward the anterior, signals from the posterior streak induce surrounding epiblast cells to form lateral mesoderm (Fig. 7.8b, small arrows). Cells only become committed to these fates, however, after they invaginate through the primitive streak (Kimura et al. 2006). The node gains the ability to induce neural tissue when the streak has reached its full extension (Fig. 7.8b, white arrows) (Storey et al. 1992).\n\nFig. 7.8 Experiments to find the mesoderm inducing signals in chicken. (a) The PMZ can induce an ectopic primitive streak and Hensen\u2019s Node when grafted at a 90\u00b0 angle with respect to the original axis. The PMZ from a quail embryo can induce a primitive streak to form when grafted to the anterior portion of a chicken epiblast. (b) Signals from the PMZ induce formation of the primitive streak in the posterior area pellucida (top embryo, black arrows). At a later stage, the primitive streak and Hensen\u2019s Node express signals that induce mesoderm and endoderm, and signals from Hensen\u2019s Node pattern the neural tissue (white arrows) Full size image\n\n7.5.4 Conclusion\n\nThe discovery of the germ layers by Pander and von Baer raised the question of how the three layers cooperate to ensure the proper placement of organs relative to each other and with respect to the body axis. Some mechanism must act to guarantee that the foregut, for instance, always forms in the head rather than in some other location. The extent of communication between the germ layers only became apparent in the early twentieth century, when experimental embryologists began dissecting embryos and transplanting tissues to different locations, or developing them in culture. Comparisons of the effects of these manipulations to the normal fate maps demonstrated that cell fates depend on their environmental context. Spemann and Mangold found that in tissue transplants, the dorsal lip of the blastopore self-differentiates as axial mesoderm and induces the overlying ectoderm to form neural tissue. Because of these properties, they named this tissue the Organizer. Subsequently, tissues with Organizer properties were discovered at the onset of gastrulation in all vertebrate embryos. The fact that Organizer tissues function across phyla boundaries indicated that a common mechanism acts in all vertebrates to induce neural tissue, despite the obvious morphological differences between the embryos at these stages. The discovery that Chordin and Noggin are expressed in the amphibian Organizer, the teleost shield and the amniote node and streak confirmed this prediction and transformed our understanding of how the vertebrate body plan is constructed. Chordin and Noggin are both secreted antagonists of the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMP), a subclass of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily that ventralizes the embryo (Piccolo et al. 1996; Zimmerman et al. 1996). Thus, instead of providing a signal that induces dorsal fates, signals from the organizer the act to block ventralizing signals.\n\nExperimental embryologists also identified the tissues that induce the Organizer, called the Nieuwkoop Center, as discussed above. In amphibians, the Nieuwkoop Center is located in the dorsal vegetal blastomeres, which are fated to become gut endoderm, and other vegetal cells induce ventral mesodermal cell types. In teleosts and amniotes, the Nieuwkoop Center is located in extraembryonic tissues, including the YSL, PMZ and the mammalian VE. Signals from these tissues induce all mesodermal and endodermal cell types in the overlying blastoderm, including the shield and node. The combined action of the Nieuwkoop Center and the Organizer explains how development of the germ layers is coordinated. Therefore, the reason the foregut always forms in the head is because prior to gastrulation, precursors of the foregut induce organizer tissue, which induces and patterns the brain and head. In teleosts and amniotes, the foregut precursors and the organizer tissues are both induced by signals emanating from extraembryonic tissues, but the result is the same: coordinated development of organs within the three germ layers."}, {"url": "https://timenote.info/en/Christian-Heinrich-von-Pander", "page_content": "Heinz Christian Pander, also Christian Heinrich Pander was a Baltic German (nowadays, Latvia) biologist and embryologist.\n\nIn 1817 he received his doctorate from the University of W\u00fcrzburg, and spent several years (1827\u20131842), performing scientific research from his estate in Carnikava (German: Zarnikau) on the banks of the Gauja River near Riga.

The combination of articles, dictionary, eBooks, journals, and primary source documents, offers a most unique resource for students and researchers. A combined aggregation of hundreds of article databases, with millions of articles in total. All the articles may be read online or download and save as eDocuments. All articles are Print-on-Demand ready.\n\n\n\nWorld Heritage Encyclopedia believes the Common Core Standards are important, and that is why at WorldHeritage.org you'll find tools to help improve student performance, strengthen instructional effectiveness, and maximize the use of your technology.\n\n\n\nWorld Heritage Encyclopedia supports learning for all grade levels, from K-12, with a user-friendly interface and grade appropriate content. World Heritage Encyclopedia has aligned itself with the Common Core and State Standards to ensure all of the nonfiction STEM content needed by any student could be found, all in one place.\n\n\n\nEvery month thousands of new articles, images, and multimedia elements are added.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Encyclopedias\n\nThe World Heritage Encyclopedia includes the great general encyclopedias of the past and the present but all types of works that claim to provide in an orderly arrangement the essence of \"all that is known\" on a subject or a group of subjects, translated from the Koine Greek enkyklios paideia, which literally means \"complete knowledge\". As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, we are continually editing, updating, and appending, articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. WorldHeritage.org is fully accessible on a tablet, smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, or any Internet-connected device with a Web browser.\n\nIs Print Obsolete?\n\n\"Thinking beyond the format\", Encyclopedias join a long list of paper we once thought we couldn't live without, like the Sears catalog, Yellow Pages and maps. Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions. Unlike many online encyclopedias, World Heritage Encyclopedia is an aggregation of professionally written, crowd sourced, peer reviewed, and edited articles, making our information the most reliable and complete encyclopedia. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic; new information can be presented almost immediately as it is happening in the world. With modern technology we have the extra advantage of information being portable as well."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1212538", "page_content": "Heinz Christian Pander, aka Christian Heinrich Pander (24 July 1794 - 22 September 1865) was a Baltic German biologist and embryologist who was born in Riga.
