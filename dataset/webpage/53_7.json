For decades afterwards, obsessive fans would focus in on details like this: What did the barefootedness mean?\n\nAnd the Volkswagen Beetle in the background, what about that? Indeed, fans would analyze and read symbolism into absolutely everything in the picture except, it seems, what the Beatles were wearing. George Harrison chose denim. But the other three matched in immaculate bespoke, all designed by a young British tailor named Tommy Nutter.\n\nAt the time Iain Macmillan took the photograph that would become one of the most famous ever\u2014the album cover of Abbey Road\u2014Tommy Nutter was a superstar in his own right.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, he was \u201cin the class of actor Terence Stamp, photographer Brian Duffy, and hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, all the stylish young Londoners who have shot themselves out of their backgrounds and into the new aristocracy.\u201d\n\nHis boutique on Savile Row was \u201cthe place for men\u2019s clothes\u2026 a whizz-bang success.\u201d He had dressed Lennon at his infamous wedding to Yoko Ono, and he would go on to dress Mick Jagger at his equally infamous one to Bianca P\u00e9rez-Mora Macias.\n\n\u201c Mick didn\u2019t like that at all. He said that a man\u2019s tailor was very special. It was a personal thing that a woman shouldn\u2019t intrude on. But I went anyway. \u201d\n\nThen he would dress Bianca herself, in attention-grabbing men\u2019s suits during the height of the women\u2019s liberation movement. \u201cMick didn\u2019t like that at all,\u201d Bianca Jagger later recalled. \u201cHe said that a man\u2019s tailor was very special. It was a personal thing that a woman shouldn\u2019t intrude on. But I went anyway.\u201d\n\nOver a three-decade career, Tommy Nutter would dress everything from Diana Ross to Elton John, David Hockney to Jack Nicholson (as the Joker, in Tim Burton\u2019s Batman). And yet, despite all this success, most people today have never even heard of him.\n\n1 / 15\n\nHaving spent the last two years excavating Nutter\u2019s dramatic biography, I have often asked myself why this is. How is it possible that the man behind some of the most iconic looks of the 1960s and \u201970s draws, at most, vague recognition when I mention his name?\n\nPartly it is a question of marketing. The better marketed your name, the more lasting it will be in the memory of consumers. Nutter did everything Giorgio Armani did, for example, except get his suits on Richard Gere in American Gigolo and his face on the cover of Time (\u201cJust the name\u2026 the name alone\u2026 the very mention of the name sends off sparks and sets up a clamor like a French fire drill,\u201d the magazine hyperventilated in 1982).\n\nBut I have also come to suspect that the oversight is related to HIV/AIDS, which Nutter contracted sometime in the late-1980s.\n\nIn some ways we have never been more attentive to what was lost during the AIDS crisis.\n\nIn the past few years, memoirs by Cleve Jones and Fred Hersch have detailed what it was like to live through the horror, and How to Survive a Plague, a history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) by David France, has documented the grassroots resistance in detail. Randy Shilts' And The Band Played On, Tony Kushner\u2019s Angels in America, and Larry Kramer\u2019s The Normal Heart remain totems of that era in their own right.\n\nWhen recalling the dead, most popular narratives also have a tendency to recycle a specific list of names, like Freddie Mercury, David Wojnarowicz, Robert Mapplethorpe.\n\nThese handful of artists are important, of course, but they are not the sum total of the toll, and repeatedly evoking them as a shorthand for describing what the plague cost the culture can also work to obfuscate the contribution of others. To use an analogy: It is like focusing on the death of a few lead actors while ignoring that the supporting actors also died, along with most of the chorus.\n\nWriting the story of Tommy Nutter reminded me that there are many creative figures who have slipped through the fault-lines in our attempts at a reckoning: people who, while not as famous as Derek Jarman or Rock Hudson or Peter Hujar, nevertheless made beautiful things and generated worthy ideas, or (if they passed when they were particularly young) promised to grow up and offer something great.\n\n\u201c My idea of AIDS was underestimating its circle of devastation. Halston and Perry Ellis may have been killed by AIDS-related ailments, but so were innumerable others who, in time, might have superseded them in terms of fame and accomplishment. \u201d\n\nIn the fashion world, for example, Willi Smith was a black designer from Philadelphia who was running a small empire when he died of \u201cpneumonia, complicated by shigella\u201d\u2014a euphemism in The New York Times\u2014at the age of 39. Patrick Kelly was the first American (also black, from Mississippi) to be welcomed into the French Chambre Syndicale du Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter when he died at 35.\n\nMy idea of AIDS was underestimating its circle of devastation. Halston and Perry Ellis may have been killed by AIDS-related ailments, but so were innumerable others who, in time, might have superseded them in terms of fame and accomplishment.\n\nThose people are worth remembering too, which is why the AIDS Memorial on Instagram is so remarkable: It attempts to mix, without distinction, that well-rehearsed list in with thousands of other lesser-known names, including John Bernd, Sandra Br\u00e9a, Michael Grumley\u2014and Tommy Nutter.\n\nNutter found out he had HIV/AIDS and responded with characteristic humor. When he told a friend about his diagnosis, she encouraged him to be positive.\n\n\u201cI just said that,\u201d he replied. \u201cI am \u2018positive.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut his decline, like the decline of too many others, was wretched and excruciating, accompanied by tremendous weight loss (until even a sheet became too heavy), opportunistic infections, and the brutal onset of dementia. Always something of a vain man, he withdrew from public view, but the media was relentless and splashed his condition across the newsstands anyway: \u201cTailor to the Stars Dying of AIDS: Tommy Nutter Has \u2018Days Left\u2019.\u201d In the end, he died of \u201cBronchopneumonia,\u201d with his mother sitting sentinel by his bedside. It was Aug. 17, 1992; he was 49 years old.\n\nAs I wrote my book, I was very conscious that what I was doing was an act of restitution, an attempt to complete the record, set it straight, give the man his due. But tracing out the contours of this person\u2019s life story turned out to be a more sobering experience than I had initially expected, illuminating my ignorance of what had happened just a little more than two decades ago.\n\nNutter has been credited as an enduring influence by Tom Ford and Tommy Hilfiger.\n\n\u201c What would Nutter had done himself if he\u2019d lived just four more years to receive the life-saving cocktail? Perhaps he would be sending his own clothes down the runway, his name conjuring associations with the titans of 20th century music and art. \u201d\n\nThis February, Todd Snyder debuted a collection at New York Fashion Week that even paid homage to Nutter\u2019s designs. That is all great; but what, I have found myself wondering, would Nutter had done himself if he\u2019d lived just four more years to receive the life-saving cocktail? Perhaps he would be sending his own clothes down the runway instead, his name conjuring associations with the titans of 20th century music and art.\n\nI have also found myself wondering: who else? Who are we still overlooking in our selective remembrance of the past? Because if Nutter, for all his achievements, has fallen into obscurity, then thousands of others\u2014hundreds of thousands\u2014with less fame but with lives of creativity and innovation, have also been forgotten.\n\nHow radically different culture, popular and otherwise, might look today if they were all still around to share their imaginations with the rest of us.\n\nLance Richardson is the author of House of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row, published by Crown."}, {"url": "https://savilerow-style.com/news/tommy-nutter-rebel-cause/", "page_content": "Tommy Nutter, the tailor who ripped up the rules of Savile Row, is remembered in a new biography. Tom Corby reports\n\nJust over a quarter of a century after his untimely death from Aids, the avant-garde Tommy Nutter, like so many creatives of his generation, is still regarded as a legend, remembered as the tailor who single-handedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row with the male peacock revolution of 1960s swinging London. His contribution to some of the most iconic styles and pop imagery of the 20th century has become part of the history of his trade as he wore down the division between tailoring and fashion. Friends say that a statue ought to be put up of him, like that of Beau Brummel, the archetypal dandy who, in the 18th century, set the bespoke style for generations.\n\nTommy spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father owned a caf\u00e9, catering, in the main, to customers like truck drivers, gas fitters and builders. He was destined to be a plumber but, over the years, emerged as a blue collar boy made good in the class crucible of the 60s; a time when the alchemy of taste, cool, and sheer force of personality could transform lives in ways that would have seemed impossible in years gone by. Tommy, a 6ft 2 inches tall young man with matinee idol looks, arrived right on cue. It all started when, aged 19, he broke free from plumbing to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. He then landed an apprenticeship with Donaldson, Williamson and Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors, with premises in Burlington Arcade. There, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentlemen\u2019s classic wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thorough knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its hierarchy.\n\nIn 1969, Tommy founded his own business, joining up with Edward Sexton, a young cutter with brilliant technical skills. They were financially backed by Tommy\u2019s close friend, the singer Cilla Black, her husband Bobby Willis and others prepared to take a risk. The venture was an immediate success although a writer in the Daily Mirror snarked: \u201cThomas Nutter is opening what he calls a \u2018thoroughly square\u2019 tailoring shop \u2026 in Savile Row next week. Well that will make a change. I mean there can\u2019t be more than a dozen there now. Mr Nutter, who is 26, is weary of \u2018all those Carnaby Street gimmicks\u2019, and thinks that clothes, like hair, are settling down to something more sober \u2026 What, then, of rumours that Ringo Starr has ordered a pair of scarlet PVC trousers from Nutters?\u201d Tommy replied curtly: \u201cThey\u2019ll be very square scarlet PVC trousers.\u201d\n\nSavile Row, with its collection of Royal Warrants, had never seen anything like it when Nutters opened at No. 35a, the story of which has been brought back to life by Lance Richardson in his biography House of Nutter \u2013 The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row. A year on, the Daily Mail was declaring it \u201ca whizz bang success \u2013 the place for men\u2019s clothes\u201d, putting the charismatic Tommy in the class of actor Terence Stamp, photographer Brian Duffy, and hair dresser Vidal Sassoon, all the stylish young Londoners who had shot themselves into the new aristocracy. Clients came in from the hipper haunts of those named in Debrett\u2019s, from the media, pop stars and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End, whose ambition was to own a Nutter suit, drawn to Tommy not only because of his matchless sense of style, but also because of his personality. He welcomed them all.\n\nLike Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy who dressed The Queen, Tommy produced lively, contemporary tailoring, but with roots deeply embedded in the craftsmanship of Savile Row. Amies named Tommy as \u201cthe most exciting tailor on Savile Row in decades.\u201d For three decades, Tommy kitted out the biggest stars on both sides of the Atlantic. He was proud of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles\u2019 Abbey Road album, three of them wore Tommy Nutter bespoke. George Harrison chose\n\ndenim. Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong, then director of the National Portrait Gallery, Mick Jagger and Elton John. Andrew Lloyd Webber was also a client as well as a friend. He has recalled: \u201cThere was a wonderful maroon coat I wore for Ascot \u2013 he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on \u2013 Tommy made clothes for Tim Rice too \u2013 we were all great mates.\u201d\n\nMick Jagger sported an eau-de-nil three-piece for his wedding to Bianca Perez-Mora Macias in 1971. He was in another Nutter creation days later on his honeymoon in Venice, fitted so snugly that it left no doubt as to which side he dressed. Celebrity nuptials became something of a thing for Tommy. John Lennon wore cream corduroy for his wedding to Yoko Ono on Gibraltar. For Elton John\u2019s marriage in 1984 Tommy made 20 suits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of mishap\u201d, as he later recalled, \u201cin a wide range of primary colours, including orange and very bright yellow. With each outfit went the appropriate straw boater.\u201d\n\nJohn Reid, Elton John\u2019s manager, has said: \u201cIt was quite an event going to Nutters. You\u2019d write the whole day off. Maybe you\u2019d have lunch and a couple of bottles of champagne.\u201d Tommy has said that when things became \u201cedgy\u201d with Elton he would send out for a bottle of sherry \u201cto smooth things along\u201d. For Elton\u2019s 36th birthday, Tommy made a suit overlaid with 1,009,444 bugle beads, each one painstakingly attached by hand. Tommy also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London, like the red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early 70s.\n\nPeople were attracted to Tommy not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but because of his ironic personality. He was a humorist with a wide and interesting circle of friends who were attracted by his enthusiasm, his gentle self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression, \u201cBut who am I to talk?\u201d He was a witty correspondent and his letters to his friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in London\u2019s Green Park.\n\nTommy died of Aids in August 1992, aged 49. \u201cThe saddest thing of all,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cis an in-between look.\u201d No-one could ever have accused him of that. At his memorial service in St George\u2019s, Hanover Square, just up the road from Savile Row, Cilla Black read an abridged excerpt from Chaucer\u2019s Canterbury Tales, relating the story of \u201cA true, a perfect gentle Knight \u2026 In dying in his excellence and flower, when he is certain of his high good name; for then he gives to friend, and self, no shame.\u201d\n\nThe final words should go to Nutters loyalist Elton John who said: \u201cTommy completely glamorised Savile Row and made it accessible.\u201d There\u2019s no arguing with that\u2026\n\nHouse of Nutter: The Rebel Tailor of Savile Row by Lance Richardson, published by Chatto & Windus. \u00a325"}, {"url": "http://www.wicksorder.com/1775.html", "page_content": "\u88c1\u7f1d\u754c\u6700\u540e\u7684\u65f6\u5c1a\u6559\u7236Tommy Nutter\n\n\u5728Tommy Nutter\uff081970\uff09\u65f6\u4ee3\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5f7b\u5e95\u4ee3\u66ff\u4e86\u88c1\u7f1d\u65f6\u5c1a\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u8428\u7ef4\u5c14\u8857\u6700\u9876\u5c16\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u3002\n\nTommy Nutter was a British tailor.\n\nTommy Nutter was born in 1943.\n\nIn his youth Nutter studied at the Tailor and Cutter Academy and worked for traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. He soon became inspired by changes in popular culture of the 1960s. In 1969 he opened his own shop, House of Nutter, in Savile Row, London. He worked with Edward Sexton, and was backed financially by Cilla Black and Peter Brown of the Beatles\u2019 company Apple He even created clothes for another fashion designer, Hardy Amies.\n\nIn the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan.\n\nNutter\u2019s suits are worn by three of the members of the Beatles on the famous cover of the Abbey Road album. He also created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.\n\nNutter died in 1992 of complications from

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThomas Albert Nutter, tailor, born Barmouth Merioneth 17 April 1943, died London 17 August 1992.\n\nTOMMY NUTTER, the avant-garde Savile Row tailor, came to prominence in the late Sixties as a man who singlehandedly reconciled the traditions of Savile Row, laid down in the late 19th century, with the male peacock revolution of the Sixties and the often extravagant demands of his clients, the leading dandies of swinging London.\n\nBorn in Wales in 1943, Nutter spent his formative years in Edgware, north London, where his father was proprietor of a cafe catering to a clientele composed of truckdrivers, gas-fitters and builders. The family moved to Kilburn and Tommy and his brother David had a normal suburban childhood, punctuated by highly enjoyable holidays at Butlin's holiday camps. He attended the Willesden Technical College where, according to his brother, he studied plumbing.\n\nIn the early Sixties, Nutter obtained a position with Donaldson, Williams & Ward, traditional Savile Row tailors with premises in the Burlington Arcade. Here, starting as an apprentice, he absorbed the lore and the rules of the English gentleman's classical wardrobe. His seven years with the firm gave him a thoroughgoing knowledge of his craft, and a lifelong respect for its rules.\n\nIn 1968, Nutter left Donaldson Williams & Ward to found his own business, first at 35a Savile Row, later in its present handsome double-fronted premises at No 19. He was backed by clients including Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Peter Brown, then Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps, also situated in Savile Row, and by the lawyer James Vallance-White.\n\nThe business was an immediate success for, like Sir Hardy Amies, a Savile Row dandy of a previous generation, Tommy Nutter produced lively, contemporary tailoring whose roots were deeply embedded in the craftsmanship and knowledge of Savile Row. Indeed, he made suits for Amies as well as for newer residents of Savile Row, and in particular the Beatles. He was proudest of the fact that, for the cover of the Beatles' album Abbey Road (1969), he dressed three out of the four (George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims). Other leading dandies of the period were also his clients, including Sir Roy Strong (then Director of the National Portrait Gallery), Mick Jagger and Elton John.\n\nNutter also applied his craft to dressing female icons of swinging London society at the time, including Cilla Black, a close friend, and Bianca Jagger, who was much photographed at the time in a white dinner jacket with white satin facings. Nutter also made a red velvet suit for Twiggy which became a celebrated and much-copied look when she was photographed wearing it in the early Seventies.\n\nIn 1971 he was elected to the Best-Dressed List in the United States, along with the Earl of Snowdon and Hardy Amies. At the time, American Menswear magazine said of Nutter that he was 'tradition spiced with daring'.\n\n'He never got things wrong about clothes,' said the restaurateur and bookshop-owner Stuart Grimshaw, who was a client of Tommy Nutter's from the late Sixties. 'He really knew what he was talking about. One would go in and say, 'What do I wear to go on safari in Kenya?' and Tommy would make one an absolutely correct safari suit, a proper one with all the pockets in exactly the right place.\n\n'This knowledge extended to such minutiae as the correct wearing of half or full brogues or co-respondent shoes. He was an encyclopaedia of correct, classical male style.'\n\nClients from the hipper purlieus of the aristocracy, from the media, pop stars, and even aspiring teenage dandies from the East End whose ambition, in the early Seventies, was to own a Nutter suit, were drawn to Tommy Nutter not only because of his ineffable sense of style, but also because of his peculiarly ironic personality.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber was a client and friend. 'He made me a lot of things when one was younger and trendier,' Lloyd Webber said. 'There was a wonderful maroon coat I remember I wore for Ascot - he was always such fun, very much part of my early life when Jesus Christ Superstar was going on - he made clothes for Tim Rice too - we were all great mates'.\n\nNutter was a gentle humorist who had a wide and interesting circle of friends attracted by his enthusiasm, by his gentle, self-mocking personality and his acerbic comments on the vagaries of others, always ending with the expression 'But who am I to talk?' He was a prodigious and witty correspondent and his letters to his many friends are treasured. In addition, he delighted in writing to the serious newspapers on topics as far-ranging as the correct buttoning of the suit on a statue of John F. Kennedy, to the scarcity of deckchairs in Green Park. He was always very ready to spring to the defence if his beloved Savile Row came under attack, as it so frequently did in the anarchic Sixties.\n\nNutter was also a firm believer in the supremacy of the English suit and of English cloth; during the Seventies and early Eighties he took part in huge international fashion shows put on by Reid & Taylor, the Scottish firm of woollen and worsted manufacturers.\n\nWith his untimely death, from complications arising from Aids, London society loses a witty and elegant dandy, whose hand-rolled lapels and insouciant manner masked a serious and continuing purpose; to make sure that the craft and traditions of Savile Row tailoring were preserved for, and valued by, his generation.\n\n(Photograph omitted)"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/03/house-nutter-rebel-tailor-savile-row-lance-richardson-review", "page_content": "The Savile Row tailor Tommy Nutter \u2013 his birth name, rather than a moniker adopted at the height of his stardom \u2013 was the exemplar of fabulous but fleeting fame in the 60s and 70s. Emerging apparently from nowhere, he quickly became \u201cthe coolest man you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d, designing flamboyant clothes for stars such as Elton John and the Beatles, who, apart from George, wore his suits on the cover of Abbey Road .\n\nLance Richardson\u2019s splendidly readable and gossipy account of his life has a trump card to play \u2013 namely the relationship between Tommy and his photographer brother, David, who acted as a kind of artistic Boswell to his brother\u2019s sartorial Johnson. Tommy died in 1992 of an Aids-related illness, but David is still alive, and his cooperation enhances a gripping read that is as much social history as it is biography.\n\nTo be gay, as both Tommy and David were, growing up in postwar Britain was a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it was a time of chemical castration for \u201cqueers\u201d and imprisonment; on the other, it was a world of secret languages and discreet clubs (with less than discreet patrons). Richardson, himself gay, writes about the persecution of homosexuals at the time with bracing anger; readers who expect a series of camp anecdotes may be surprised as he describes how the outing and punishment of gay men was \u201clike a public hanging transposed from the middle ages: prurient [and] ethically indefensible\u201d.\n\nIt was in this milieu that Tommy, a talented young \u201ccutter\u201d who learned his trade on Savile Row, opened his first boutique at No 35a with the brilliant Edward Sexton. With the financial and publicity assistance of, among others, Cilla Black and Peter Brown (one of the Beatles\u2019 management team), Nutter was the right man in the right place, strutting about in a gorgeous, ridiculous era peopled by characters such as Michael Fish, who sold silk kipper ties from his eponymous Clifford Street boutique in the shape of actual kippers. Nutter, a \u201ccomely youth from Edgware\u201d, north London, soon rose to the challenge, producing outfits that were \u201can eccentric mix of Lord Emsworth, the Great Gatsby and Bozo the Clown\u201d.\n\nTommy's idea of making a splash was to throw himself into the Thames after being ejected from a party at the Tate\n\nIt is no surprise that the likes of Lennon and Jagger were aficionados; nor that, after quickly scaling the heights, Nutter went into decline, irrelevance giving way to ill health. A lesser writer might have made the story of his downfall depressing, but Richardson has an eye for telling and hilarious details. We learn, for instance, that for Elton John\u2019s (first) wedding in 1984, Nutter created 20 wildly exuberant outfits, \u201ctwo of each, in case of any mishap, in a wide range of primary colours\u201d.\n\nIt is David who gives the story a wider dimension. He was nicknamed \u201cDawn Black\u201d for his habit of partying throughout the night in New York, though he was a more introverted and less reckless character than his brother, photographing the stars of the day, but remaining an observer rather than a participant in bacchanalian pursuits. But then he could hardly help seeming less colourful than Tommy \u2013 a man whose idea of making a splash was to throw himself into the Thames after being ejected from a party at the Tate.\n\nHouse of Nutter, Richardson\u2019s first book, is a fine match of author and subject. He writes with flair and erudition, making extensive use of interviews with David, and bringing something new to the evocation of an era that might seem overfamiliar and cliched to many. In fact, barring the absence of an index, it\u2019s hard to find fault with this thoroughly enjoyable glimpse into high fashion and low life."}, {"url": "https://putthison.com/house-of-nutter-the-rebel-tailor-of-savile-row/", "page_content": "The best books about men\u2019s style are often social histories, but they\u2019re few and far between. Thomas Girtin\u2019s Nothing but the Best, which documents the tradition of English craftsmanship through the people who actually made such wonderful items, is one of the best books I\u2019ve read on bespoke tailoring and shoemaking. Gilles Lipovtsky\u2019s The Empire of Fashion explores the intersection of our modern obsession with appearance and democratic values. In Ametora, David Marx digs deep into how Japan saved classic American style. And the best works by Bruce Boyer, such as True Style, are about how clothes intertwine with culture.\n\nThese books are rare because they take a tremendous amount of work and have a limited audience. But beyond your basic texts on how to combine a shirt and tie, these social histories are so much richer and more interesting than pretty photo books you\u2019ll pick up once and never remember (a genre that makes up most of this field).\n\nLance Richardson\u2019s House of Nutter is one of those rare books. It focuses on one of the most unusual tailoring houses in the post-war period, Nutters of Savile Row. If you\u2019re not familiar with the name, you\u2019ve certainly seen their work. Nutters dressed everyone from Elton John to Mick Jagger, Twiggy to Diana Ross. On the album cover of Abbey Road, three of the four Beatles can be seen wearing Nutters bespoke \u2014 John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Paul McCartney. They didn\u2019t coordinate their outfits that day, they just showed up in the clothes they loved most.\n\nThe Nutters look helped to define the uproarious 1970s. It takes a bit of inspiration from traditional English hacking jackets, which were originally built for horse riding. The jackets are long and full-bodied, with square shoulders, nipped waists, and lapels so wide they grazed the wearer\u2019s shoulder joints. Traditional hacking jackets have flared skirts so they can neatly spread out across a saddle. Nutters exaggerated this effect, which gave the wearer an X-shaped silhouette. For those who wanted the full Monty, suits were made from loud plaid fabrics, taped edges, and patch pockets that had been cut on a bias, so they would contrast against the rest of the garment. Punch once described the Nutters look as \u201can eccentric mix of Lord Emsworth, the Great Gatsby, and Bozo the Clown.\u201d I think of it as wild and chic, even if it\u2019s a bit dated in hindsight.\n\nHouse of Nutter is a bit about everything. There are some technical details here that will satisfy bespoke tailoring nerds, but it\u2019s wonderfully grounded in a way that\u2019s rare in this genre. Often, talk about bespoke tailoring gets a bit too pompous and pretentious, exaggerating claims about how a custom-made suit will fit perfectly and turn every man into Cary Grant. Richardson captures all of the romance of bespoke tailoring \u2014 even getting into nitty gritty details of how a client\u2019s pattern is drafted \u2014 without falling for naive illusions. In my interview with him a couple of weeks ago, he told me how he talked to tailors in and around Savile Row, then had the copy proofread and fact-checked by the same tailors to make sure everything is correct.\n\nThen there\u2019s the story of Tommy himself. How he pulled himself out of the working class with little more than the sheer power of his imagination, \u201cso boundless, it seemed, it could overcome all reason and even prove ruinous.\u201d Nutter started off as a salesman at the front of the house at Donaldson, Williamson & Ward, another Savile Row firm. Inspired by the wilder creations by Michael Fish at the time, Nutter saw the possibility of marrying a bolder aesthetic with traditional English craftsmanship. And to realize his creations, he found his cutter in Edward Sexton, who was just daring enough to not brush off his ideas. Sexton was the technical genius behind the Nutters curtain; Tommy himself the visionary and socialite who brought in the celebrity clients.\n\nMuch of that socializing happened at gay clubs, Studio 54, and other party venues. Tommy was a gay man who came of age during the oppressive and censorious 1950s, so he met people in underground scenes. As Richardson writes: \u201cIndeed, his life vividly personified forty years of critical gay history. From underground queer clubs of Soho to the unbridled freedom of New York bathhouses to the terrifying nightmare of AIDS \u2013 Tommy was there, both witness and participant.\u201d\n\nThe book is full of great stories, such as the one of John Lennon and Yoko Ono hanging out in the shop naked when Edward Sexton came into work one day. But there\u2019s also a darker and more depressing side of the story. Tommy Nutter was wildly extravagant and almost drove the firm into bankruptcy. He self-medicated with alcohol, often to the point of blackout, and eventually had a falling out with his cutter, Sexton. In the end, Nutter died of AIDS-related complications. He scaled to a level of success few have seen, but also harbored a dark and tormented personal life that\u2019s all too relatable. One of the remarkable things about the book is how Richardson was able to get people to open up about a very difficult part of their personal histories \u2014 Tommy\u2019s brother, David; Edward Sexton; and the many people who worked at the Nutter firm. It gives the book a great sense of depth and intimacy.\n\nWithout Nutters of Savile Row, we may have never gotten contemporary designer-tailors such as Richard James and Ozwald Boateng, or the \u201970s influenced look of Tom Ford. Richardson\u2019s book captures that wonderful part of history, as well as the cultural forces that gave the clothes meaning. The book is perfectly summed up in the original idea that founded the tailoring house: \u201cthe fabric you wore, the way it was cut, the lifestyle you lived \u2014 it all went together.\u201d\n\nHouse of Nutter is available on Amazon and Penguin Books. Richardson also maintains a website, where you can learn more about his other works. He tells us he\u2019s already working on a new book project, although it\u2019s not about fashion."}]}
