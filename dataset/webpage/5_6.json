Dananjaya is the latest one in that list. Having not played a first class game, Dananjaya was picked for the 2012 T20 WC. Mahela Jayawardene was so impressed by the youngsters control of the googly, carrom ball, leg-break, doosra and off-spinner, that he convinced the selectors to fast track him to the national side. Dananjaya did not disappoint as he played 4 games and picked up 7 wickets at an average of 13 and an economy under 7.\n\n\n\nHowever, he only played one more game before being dropped. He was also overlooked for the 2014 T20 World Cup in Bangladesh. With the success in the T20 World Cup, Dananjaya was snapped up by the Chennai Super Kings during the 2013 edition for $20,000.\n\n\n\nRevolving doors of Sri Lankan cricket meant that Dhananjaya could never settle himself in the national team. Having played a handful of T20Is, he found himself completely out of favour with the national selectors for four long years. He was eventually recalled to the national team during the home season of 2017 and promptly made an immediate impact, grabbing career-best figures of four for 47 against the visiting Zimbabweans. It wasn't an one-off achievement, two days after his marriage, he claimed six for 54 against India, thereby cementing his place for the immediate future."}, {"url": "https://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketers/akila-dananjaya-574178", "page_content": "Another instalment from Sri Lanka's production line of unorthodox spinners, Akila Dananjaya sparked controversy when he was picked in the preliminary squad for the 2012 T20 World Cup despite never having played a professional match in his life. Able to deliver a legbreak, googly, carrom ball, doosra and a stock offspinner with astounding control, he had impressed Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene so much as a net bowler at a practice session that Jayawardene requested he be fast-tracked to the national squad.\n\nDananjaya played three matches of the World Cup, including the final, but went out of favour with the selectors once Jayawardene stepped down from the captaincy.\n\nHe made his comeback in 2017, and took a six-for against India in an ODI that year, and another against South Africa in 2018. In between he made a successful entry into Test cricket, taking four five-wicket hauls in his first six Tests.\n\nIn September 2019, Dananjaya was banned from bowling in international cricket for 12 months because of an illegal bowling action. His return was dramatic - in a T20I in Antigua in March 2021, he took a hat-trick in one over but was carted for six sixes by Kieron Pollard in his next."}, {"url": "https://tfipost.com/2022/10/cricketer-akila-dananjaya-biography-carerer-and-profile/", "page_content": "Akila Dananjaya Biography and Career\n\nMahamarakkala Kurukulasooriya Patabendige Akila Dananjaya Perera, popularly as Akila Dananjaya, is a professional Sri Lankan cricketer, who plays all forms of the game for the national team.

It was a memorable debut for Akila Dananjaya.\n\nA Test debut is always special for any cricketer, he has to win every race to make it to the national squad. He needs to be the best from his district, from his state, among his imminent peers to draw attention. It is no less than a dream come true for a cricketer to don the national whites. No words can describe the joy, but one shouldn\u2019t overlook the kind of pressure a debutant goes through.\n\nThe pressure is always there, the pressure of justifying his selection, pressure of making an immediate impact, the pressure of announcing himself on a high, which is always beneficial. When Akila Dananjaya was handed the Test cap in the second Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka, another dream to play Test cricket came true for a talented and potent cricketer.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAkila Dananjaya is a testament to Sri Lanka\u2019s reputation of producing unorthodox spinners on a regular basis. He has a plethora of variations up in his sleeves and possesses good control over it. He can bowl off-spin as well as leg-breaks, which is rare, extremely rare. He is a wizard of spin bowling and embraced Test cricket on a high, cleaning up Sri Lanka with three wickets to his name.\n\nSri Lanka did well to post a gritty total of 222 on a testing surface. The pitch had enough help for the spinners and Bangladeshi bowlers did well to exploit it. Sri Lanka showed some nerves of steel and got to a competitive total riding on Roshen Silva and Kusal Mendis\u2019 fighting fifties. Runs from tail-enders is always a bonus for the batting side and frustrating for the opposition. Akila Dananjaya got a valuable 20 to make a good impression with the bat on his debut.\n\nWhen Bangladesh walked out to bat, the pressure was certainly on Sri Lanka to get early wickets and inflict damage at the outset. Suranga Lakmal and Dilruwan Perera did well to get their side off to a flying start by chipping early wickets. Lakmal was outstanding with the new ball and at stumps on Day 1, Bangladesh were precariously placed at 56 for 4.\n\nAkila creates havoc\n\nLiton Das\u2019 dismissal was an early blow for Tigers, but the presence of Mahmudullah and Mehidy Hasan Miraz gave the fans assurance. Sri Lankan captain threw the ball to debutant Akila Danajaya. The wily Lankan spinner broke the backbone of Bangladesh batting lineup in no time.\n\nDanajaya delivered a gem of a ball to outfox Mahmudullah. It pitched slightly outside off from a good length, turned after landing and beat Mahmudallah\u2019s defence to disturb the timber. That particular dismissal opened the floodgates and Bangladesh innings folded in the twinkle of an eye. They lost five wickets for just three runs \u2013 an embarrassing situation which one could notice ten or fifteen years ago.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAt the end Day 1, not many would have predicted Bangladesh to flounder like nine pins on Day 2. They had some batting left and one would have expected them to get close to Sri Lanka\u2019s total, but it wasn\u2019t to be. A total of 14 wickets fell on Day 1, and the succeeding day was no different. Once again, a total of 14 wickets were fell on Day 2.\n\nRoshen Silva\u2019s stubborn resistance had been the talk of the town so far along with Bangladesh\u2019s meek surrender. indeed, temperamentally, Bangladesh were very poor but very few could utilize the fragile mentality of a team and for a debutante, it\u2019s never an easy task. But Akila showed he can spot the weakness of a team and utilise it ruthlessly.\n\nadsense\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have got any better for the debutant to have the wicket of opposition captain as his first Test scalp. Bangladesh were in real trouble and needed a quiet partnership from somewhere."}, {"url": "https://www.cricketcountry.com/news/akila-dananjaya-stars-on-test-debut-sri-lanka-win-series-1-0-against-bangladesh-685130", "page_content": "Updated: February 10, 2018 1:19 PM IST | Edited By: Kaustubh Mayekar\n\nAkila Dananjaya finished with 8 wickets from his debut match AFP[/caption] [caption id=\"attachment_685135\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"628\"]Akila Dananjaya finished with 8 wickets from his debut match AFP[/caption]\n\nAkila Dananjaya 's stunning show handed Sri Lanka a 215-run victory on Day Three of the second Test against Bangladesh . After a drawn Test in Chittagong, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh gave each other a tough competition in the decider at Dhaka where bowlers dominated. Sri Lanka put up 222 in the first innings and bundled the hosts for 110 to take the lead. They then posted a 339-run target, scoring 226 in the following innings, while Dananjaya's 5-for rattled Bangladesh, bowling them out for 123.\n\nApart from Kusal Mendis and Roshen Silva, the Sri Lanka batsmen faltered on a fresh Dhaka pitch as spinners shone from the very beginning. Abdur Razzak put up a powerful performance on his comeback, bagging 4 wickets in the first innings and was complemented well by Taijul Islam who picked up as many wickets. Mendis and Silva both scored half-centuries to give some runs for their bowlers to defend.\n\nHowever, Bangladesh put up an even disappointing batting performance, collapsing for 110. Mehedi Hasan was the highest run-getter with 38 runs; Suranga Lakmal and Dananjaya bagged 3-for each.\n\nThere was no change in scenario in the two following innings. Sri Lanka's top order faltered again and Roshen Silva came to the rescue. He scored yet another half-century and remained unbeaten on 70, while his teammates gave away wickets at regular interval. Roshen's knock pushed Bangladesh's target to 339. Taijul finished with 8 wickets from the match.\n\nUnder pressure, the hosts failed to produce any significant performance. Mominul Haque survived the third day of the Test but could not contribute more than 33, which was the highest by any batsman in the innings. Only four batsmen managed double-digit scores. Post lunch, Dananajaya ran through the middle and lower order, bagging 5 wickets from the innings. He thus became the third Sri Lanka cricketer to pick a 5-for on Test debut and contributed majorly as Sri Lanka defeated the hosts to win the series 1-0.

This year, the historical tournament will see the participation of six nations. The nations with Test status \u2013 India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan received a direct entry into the tournament, while Hong Kong, Malaysia, Nepal, Oman, Singapore, and UAE had to compete in the qualifiers for the remaining one spot, in which Hong Kong emerged victorious.\n\nConsidering the exhausting two-month long England tour, India rested skipper Virat Kohli and gave the command to Rohit Sharma. India will begin their campaign against Hong Kong on Tuesday. Even though Hong Kong has not yet received an ODI status by the ICC, the match will still be considered as an official One-Day International, as per a recent ruling by the cricket board.\n\nHere are all the interesting facts about the historical tournament:\n\n* The first Asia Cup was held in 1984 in Sharjah in the UAE. Only three countries took part in the tournament at the time \u2013 India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan. It started off as a round-robin tournament, and the nation with most victories was declared the winner. The tournament was organised by the then, newly formed Asian Cricket Council. Indian team led by Sunil Gavaskar lifted the inaugural trophy as they defeated by Sri Lanka and Pakistan.\n\n* India pulled out of the second edition of the tournament in 1986, held in Sri Lanka, due to sour cricketing relations with the host nation. Bangladesh was included in the tournament. Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan in the final to clinch the trophy.\n\n* In 1988, the third Asia Cup was held in Bangladesh \u2013 the first time a multi-nation tournament was held in the country.

The six participating nations in this edition of the Asia Cup are India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Hong Kong.\n\nThe six teams have been divided into two groups of three teams each.\n\nGroup A: India, Pakistan, Hong Kong\n\nGroup B: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan\n\nThe top two teams from each group will be progressing to the Super Four. After playing each other in the Super Four, the top two teams from the Super Four will go on to play the final match, which is scheduled on 28th of September 2018.\n\nSri Lanka's Performance in the Asia Cup\n\nSri Lanka has been the 2nd most successful team in the history of Asia Cup, after India. They have won the tournament five times and have been runners up six times in the 13 editions, held so far.\n\nAlthough the performance of the Sri Lankan team has been inconsistent over the last few years, they still came into this year's Asia Cup as one of the favourites.\n\nWith experienced players like Angelo Mathews and Malinga in their side, they seemed almost certain to reach the Super Four.\n\nIn the inaugural match of the tournament, Sri Lanka faced Bangladesh. It was expected to be a very close match, as Bangladesh also had a very strong side with the likes of Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan in their side.\n\nSri Lanka started off very well, with Malinga bowling a great opening spell. Bangladesh lost two early wickets and also had their star batsman Tamim Iqbal retired hurt, with a fractured wrist. However, their wicketkeeper-batsman Musfiqur Rahim made a splendid century to take his team to a respectable total of 261 runs.\n\nSri Lanka began their chase in a positive manner, with Upul Tharanga hitting a few boundaries. However, the Bangladeshi bowlers came back strongly and ran through the Sri Lankan batting lineup. Sri Lanka were bundled out for just 124 runs.\n\nThus Bangladesh won the match by a huge margin of 137 runs and began their Asia Cup campaign in style.\n\nThe Sri Lankan team was shellshocked after this humiliating defeat. They had hardly any time before their next match against Afghanistan, which now became a do or die game for them.\n\nHowever, Sri Lanka were still the favourites to win and progress to the Super Four. Although Afghanistan had a world class bowler like Rashid Khan in their team, as a whole, their team was not that great.\n\nNevertheless, the Afghan batsmen played well to put up a competitive total of 249 runs on the board. Rahmat Shah was their highest scorer with 72 runs.\n\nAfter their disastrous batting performance against Bangladesh, the Sri Lankan batsmen were under pressure while chasing the Afghanistan total.\n\nMost of their top order batsmen got starts, but no one could carry on. As a result, wickets kept falling at regular intervals, and the asking rate continuously increased. When Rashid Khan and Md Nabi came into the attack, the Sri Lankan batsmen found it even harder to get going. They finally got all out for 158 runs and thus lost the match by 91 runs.\n\nConcluding Comments\n\nThis loss meant that Sri Lanka were out of the Asia Cup after losing both their matches. And Bangladesh and Afghanistan were through to the Super Four from Group B.\n\nBangladesh were expected to reach the Super Four. But for Afghanistan cricket, this will surely be a historic moment. They achieved something, which was unthinkable, even a few years back.\n\nOn the other hand, for Sri Lankan cricket, this is surely one of the lowest points, in the last few decades.\n\nPoll : 0 votes"}, {"url": "https://crickvik.com/asia-cup-of-cricket-history-winner-list-teams-schedule-host-country/", "page_content": "Asia Cup of Cricket History, Winner List, Teams, Schedule, Host Country\n\nAsia Cup\n\nAsian Cricket Council was established in 1983 to enhance mutual relations and cricket ties between Asian countries.

While they won the Test series, 2-0, breaking Pakistan's undefeated streak at the UAE, they succumbed to an embarrassing 0-5 whitewash in the ODI series. Incidentally, this was the Lankans' third ODI whitewash in 2017. One year later, they are a new side travelling to the UAE with considerable changes that can create a lasting impact and make this Asia Cup 2018 a memorable one. Sri Lanka will kick-off the tournament when they face Bangladesh in the opener on September 15. Let's take a look at Sri Lanka's complete squad ahead of the Asia Cup 2018:\n\nTeam Sri Lanka squad for Asia Cup 2018\n\nTwo of the prominent players that missed out the series against Pakistan last year have returned to the side. While Captain Angelo Mathews returns to the squad after facing a spell on the sidelines due to an injury, their spearhead Lasith Malinga was axed for not playing any domestic cricket. While Mathews' inclusion does provide a backbone to Sri Lanka's fragile batting department, it is Malinga's selection that could prove vital for Sri Lanka's success in Asia Cup.\n\nThe 35-year-old pacer is the only active Sri Lankan pacer to have picked up 300 wickets and that is a bundle of experience that the pacer brings to the squad. But on hindsight, Malinga hasn't played any cricket for Sri Lanka for over a year after being overlooked. Malinga who made a comeback of sorts last year after a long hiatus due to a knee injury has never looked his menacing best. Doubts have been cast over his ability to perform at the same level but coach Chandika Hathurusingha believes that he is much fitter than what he was initially in January.\n\nWhile Malinga's return is welcomed, Sri Lanka will miss their talisman of recent times, Akila Dananjaya as he will miss the two opening games with his wife giving birth to their first kid. He has been replaced by the 36-year-old Dilruwan Perera, who like Malinga hasn't played an ODI for more than a year.\n\nAnother key replacement will be unavailability of wicket keeper Dinesh Chandimal who fractured his middle finger during a domestic game in August. Niroshan Dickwella replaces him while opener Danushka Gunathilaka makes a comeback after serving a six-match ban for breaching a team curfew. Sri Lanka's route to the Super fours look fairly straightforward as they will avoid the heavyweights in India and Pakistan. But fixtures against Afghanistan and Bangladesh can be tricky ones and the team will be aware of this going into the tournament.\n\nAngelo Mathews (C), Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis, Upul Tharanga, Danushka Gunathilake, Thisara Perera, Dasun Shanaka, Dhanajaya de Silva, Akila Dhananjaya, Dilruwan Perera, Amila Aponso, Kasun Rajitha, Suranga Lakmal, Dusmantha Chameera, Lasith Malinga and Niroshan Dickwella (W).\n\nNOW READ\n\nWhen, where and how to watch Asia Cup cricket and full schedule of Asia Cup 2018\n\nAsia Cup 2018: Most memorable India vs Pakistan matches in Asia Cup Cricket\n\nAsia Cup 2018: The full list of Indian Team that will play the Asia Cup in Dubai\n\n> More on Sports"}, {"url": "https://www.timesnownews.com/asia-cup/article/asia-cup-2018-sri-lanka-squad-sri-lanka-asia-cup-team-players-schedule-match-date-time/283619", "page_content": "Angelo Mathews will lead Sri Lanka in Asia Cup 2018. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nSri Lanka, who have won the Asia Cup on five occasions, would be keen to add another title to their name.

Hong Kong, the associate that won the 2018 Asia Cup qualifier, joined as the sixth team. Abu Dhabi and Dubai cricket grounds were the venues for all the matches.\n\nThe tournament consisted of two groups of 3 teams. The top two teams from each group then proceeded to the Super Four section of the competition where they played each other to decide the top two finalists. While India won the tournament in a last-ball thriller against Bangladesh, Sri Lanka failed to qualify for the Super Four section itself.\n\nWhen it comes to Asia Cup Sri Lanka always start as favorites. In the previous 12 ODI Asia Cup tournaments, Sri Lanka was the best team in terms of the win-loss ratio. Even now their win-loss ratio is the best at 68%. Sri Lanka have won the trophy 5 times second only to India who now have 6 of them.\n\nSri Lanka must have been relieved at the prospect of playing relatively weaker teams in their group and would have been looking to get into the Super Four stage of the tournament without much trouble. They picked a mix of youth and experience in the team. This series was supposed to be a good team building exercise for them ahead of the 2019 ODI World Cup.\n\nThree days. Two matches. Two defeats against lower ranked teams. That\u2019s all it took Sri Lanka to crash out of the Asia Cup 2018. Worse teams have lasted longer. Very rarely we see two upsets in three days involving the same team. Very rarely you see a decent team fail in all possible areas of the game. Very rarely you see a team fail so miserably that they wished they had never participated.\n\nThe margins of the defeats were huge as well \u2013 137 against Bangladesh and 91 against Afghanistan. The defeats were so comprehensive that it is hard on Bangladesh and Afghanistan to categorize these defeats as upsets. Both the matches were done and dusted well before the final whistle. Sri Lanka failed to show the spine in any of the departments whatsoever.\n\nSri Lanka brought back the legendary bowler Lasith Malinga to strengthen the pace squadron. This was the only ploy that worked for them in an otherwise forgettable Asia Cup. There were no other silver linings.\n\nMalinga took 4 for 23 in the first match against Bangladesh. He could have had more if not for Sri Lanka\u2019s sloppy fielding. They dropped overall four catches in that match. And to make the matter worse, two of them reprieved Mushfiqur Rahim who eventually went on to get a century and be the prime architect of Bangladesh\u2019s win.\n\nLet us not even get started with their running between the wickets. Down at 38 for 4, when finally it looked like Sri Lanka are getting back in the grove chasing 262 against Bangladesh, Mathews ran Danushka out in a horrible mix up.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only time Mathews was responsible for a run-out. He ran the youngster Jayasuriya out when the pair was looking like getting Sri Lanka out of the hole again versus Afghanistan. Add to that the mix up between Dhananjaya de Silva and Upul Tharanga and we have complete recipe for disaster.\n\nFitness too seemed a matter concern for Sri Lanka. Angelo Mathews and Lasith Malinga looked visibly unfit while the rest of the team looked rusty in the outfield.\n\nIn both these matches, Sri Lanka never looked like winning but the thing that would hurt them the most is that they never looked like fighting too. Sri Lanka have gone back a couple of years in their preparation for the World Cup next year. The only good thing about being so down is that the only way now is up.\n\nImmediately after the exit from Asia cup, Sri Lanka dropped Angelo Mathews for ODIs and T20I against England. It\u2019s time the Sri Lankan team supports their new captain Kusal Perera and show a much-improved performance against England who themselves have come out of such a hole a few years back and are now one of the best teams in ODIs.\n\nCheck out our list of cricket betting sites for best odds and bonuses!"}, {"url": "https://www.thepapare.com/sri-lankas-memorable-asia-cup-moments/", "page_content": "The second most successful team in Asia Cups, winning 5 titles, Sri Lanka has dominated the batting and bowling charts of the competition that was first held in 1984.\n\nFrom 1986 to 2008 Sri Lanka featured in 9 consecutive Asia Cup finals, winning 4 of them. After missing out on the finals in 2012 they once again featured in an Asia Cup final in 2014, which they went on to win.\n\nSince winning the first ever Asia Cup match to be played, beating Pakistan by 5 wickets in Sharjah, Sri Lanka have gone through some wonderful moments throughout the years. Reaching the finals 10 times in 13 editions is no mean feat.\n\nSri Lanka vs India \u2013 Most memorable ODIs\n\nAs the 14th Asia Cup is just a week away, let\u2019s take a look at the 5 most memorable moments from Sri Lanka\u2019s journey through 13 Asia Cups from 1984 to 2016.\n\nSri Lanka wins the Asia Cup for the first time.\n\nAsia Cup 1986 \u2013 Sri Lanka\n\nThe 6th of April in 1986 is undoubtedly an unforgettable day for all Sri Lankan Cricket freaks as Sri Lanka, under the great Duleep Mendis\u2019 leadership, clinched their first ever major title in International cricket. The then President of Sri Lanka Mr. J. R. Jayawardene even had to declare the following day a public holiday to commemorate the victory in response to the requests of the large crowd. Such was the importance of the victory for the Sri Lankan masses.\n\nThe 1986 Asia Cup was the 2nd Asia Cup to happen and Sri Lanka were the hosts. Defending champions, India controversially withdrew from the tournament due to the political turmoil which prevailed in the island. Bangladesh participated in the tournament for the first time to make it a 3-team competition.\n\nSri Lanka, who lost to Pakistan in their first match made it to the final after beating Bangladesh convincingly. Sri Lanka started the all-important final, which was played at the SSC Grounds in Colombo, strongly, taking 5 Pakistani wickets for just 72 runs in 26 overs, but they failed to stop Javed Miandad who scored a chanceless 67 facing 100 balls to help Pakistan reach 191. In fact Pakistan accumulated 91 runs in the last 9 overs.\n\nVisit the Asia Cup 2018 hub\n\nIn the run-chase Sri Lanka were blessed with an injury to Pakistani skipper Imran Khan who otherwise would have been a threat to the Lankan batsmen with both his tactful leadership and smart bowling. Pakistan however managed to strike even after Sri Lanka made a steady start to leave Sri Lanka on 3 for 64. Then\n\nit was the young Ranatunga \u2013 De Silva duo who stood up to rescue Sri Lanka as they put on a 97-run partnership for the 4th wicket in 16.1 overs. Ranatunga scored 57 while De Silva scored 52. Sri Lanka won the match by 5 wickets with 16 balls remaining. Arjuna Ranatunga was 22 and Aravinda de Silva was just 20 at that time. The service these two legends went on to do for Sri Lanka Cricket is something every Cricket fan would remember forever.\n\nRanatunga was also adjudged Man of the Series for scoring 105 runs in 3 matches with an impressive average of 52.50. An interesting fact about the final is that it was also considered to be part of a Triangular tournament conducted parallel to the Asia Cup featuring New Zealand.\n\n2. Captain cool\u2019s brilliant century guides Sri Lanka to victory over India\n\nAsia Cup 1997 \u2013 Sri Lanka\n\nAfter Sri Lanka\u2019s Asia Cup triumph in 1986 India went on to win 3 straight Asia Cups in 1988, 1990/91 and 1995 in Bangladesh, India and U.A.E respectively. Interestingly Sri Lanka led by \u2018Captain Cool\u2019, Arjuna Ranatunga were the runners-up in all 3 editions. After winning the World Cup in 1996 Sri Lanka began the 1997 Asia Cup as hot favourites. Living up to expectations Sri Lanka clinched the trophy, going unbeaten.\n\nSri Lanka met defending champions India in their second league match at the R. Premadasa International Stadium, after winning a thriller against Pakistan by 15 runs at the same venue. Sanath Jayasuriya\u2019s brilliant bowling in the death helped Sri Lanka edge past Pakistan on that occasion. The match against India was also no different to the game against Pakistan. This time Sri Lanka were chasing. After India set a target of 228 Sri Lanka lost both Jayasuriya and De Silva for just 9 runs.\n\nCaptain Ranatunga, who then walked in, unfurled a blinder of an innings to take Sri Lanka over the line and secure a final berth. He was well supported by opener Atapattu (31) and Wicket keeper batsman Lanka de Silva (37*) who batted at 6. Ranatunga steered two valuable partnerships of 108 and 106* for the 3rd and 5th wickets respectively as Sri Lanka won the match by 6 wickets with 32 balls remaining.\n\nRanatunga\u2019s excellent innings comprised of 17 boundaries. He in fact ended the tournament as the highest run-scorer with 272 runs in 4 matches with a mind-blowing average of 136 to be named the Man of the Series.\n\n3. Mendis\u2019 mystery dismantles India.\n\nAsia Cup 2008 \u2013 Pakistan\n\nAfter the success in 1997, Sri Lanka lost the 2000 Asia Cup final handing Pakistan their first ever Asia Cup title. The next Asia Cup was hosted by Sri Lanka in 2004 which Sri Lanka went on to win, beating India in the final.\n\nSri Lanka began the 2008 Asia Cup as defending champions and also as runners-up of the 2007 World Cup. Led by the mastermind Mahela Jayawardena, Sri Lanka faced India in their last league match at the National Stadium in Karachi. Sri Lanka had already qualified for the final after winning all the previous matches by margins well over 50 runs. Batting first for the 5th time in 5 matches Sri Lanka posted their 4th 300-plus score in the tournament setting India a target of 309. The strong Indian batting line-up chased down the target losing just 4 wickets with 19 balls remaining. They in fact had chased down 300 against Pakistan in a previous game, in the same venue in the same tournament, with 47 balls remaining. Such was the form the Indian batsmen were in.\n\nSri Lanka went in to the final at the National Stadium in Karachi with 2 changes. One was the inclusion of Ajantha Mendis. This time inserted to bat unlike in the previous match Sri Lanka were bundled out for 273, their lowest total in the tournament. The 273 Sri Lanka scored was also largely thanks to a brilliant century by Sanath Jayasuriya who scored 125 runs.\n\nVirender Sehwag gave India a flying start scoring 60 runs in just 36 balls with 12 fours. India were on 76/1 after 9 overs when Jayawardena introduced Mandis ahead of the experienced Muralitharan in to the attack. Sehwag showed intent to attack the first ball. Mendis dropped his 2nd ball short, expecting Sehwag to charge down the ground and Sangakkara had no trouble in completing the stumping.\n\nYuvraj Singh who walked in next was the unlucky guy, he had to face the Magic ball, the carom ball which none of the Indian batsmen had faced before. It was only his second delivery, the ball released with a flick off Mendis\u2019 middle finger fell on a good length and just rushed through Yuvraj\u2019s defence to disturb the stumps. A few overs later Suresh Raina was also dismissed in an identical manner.\n\nMendis trapped Rohit Sharma right in front of middle stump off the last over of his first spell which lasted 4 overs. He was handed the ball for his second spell in the 30th over with India struggling on 147/6 but still believing in their skipper M.S.Dhoni who was battling hard in the middle.\n\nSanga delivers message about preparation for national cricket team\n\nMendis once again turned up his magic with 2 wickets in 2 balls in his 6th over as he dismissed Irfan Pathan and R.P. Singh. The hat-trick ball too saw a very close appeal by the Lankans which was unfortunately turned down by umpire Simon Tauffel. Mendis finished on 6/13, bowling 8 overs. Chaminda Vaas dismissed Dhoni few overs later and Nuwan Kulasekara castled Ishant Sharma to seal the title for Sri Lanka with a thumping 100-run victory.\n\nAjantha Mendis won both the Man-of-the-Match and Man-of-the-Series awards for his brilliant performances throughout the tournament. He topped the bowlers chart with 17 wickets in 5 matches.\n\n4. Maharoof jolts India with a hat-trick\n\nAsia Cup 2010 \u2013 Sri Lanka\n\nThe next Asia Cup after Sri Lanka\u2019s famous victory in Karachi was the 2010 edition in Sri Lanka. The tournament started in grand style with a thrilling encounter between Sri Lanka and Pakistan. Sri Lanka won the match by 16 runs eventually though Pakistani skipper Shahid Afridi scored a fighting century.\n\nFarveez Maharoof who went wicket-less in that game was replaced by Chanaka Welagedara in the next match against Bangladesh. Sri Lanka, who beat Bangladesh quite easily rested Lasith Malinga and Nuwan Kulasekara for the last league match against India as they had already qualified for the finals. Farveez Maharoof took over the responsibility of bowling with the new ball in this game.\n\nAfter putting India to bat Sri Lanka were desperate for some quick wickets as India were well set for a big score on 180/4 after 36 overs with two set batsmen in M.S.Dhoni and Rohit Sharma in the middle. Maharoof was handed the ball by skipper Kumar Sangakkara for his third spell when he had bowled 7 overs for 35 runs picking up Virat Kohli\u2019s wicket.\n\nWith a young Ravindra Jadeja facing his first delivery in the next Maharoof over, he started off with perfect delivery to a new batsman. The ball was straight as an arrow and the left-hander played right across it to be adjudged LBW. Maharoof produced a perfect delivery to Praveen Kumar who came in at 8 to have him chopping on.\n\nZaheer Khan stepped in to face the hat-trick ball. Interestingly as everything was set for the hat-trick ball, the bails fell off the stumps due to the stiff breeze, leading former Pakistani cricketer Ramiz Raja, who was commentating at the time, to say, \u201cIt could be that the Sri Lankans are anticipating something big\u201d.\n\nAs he anticipated, as Maharoof anticipated and as the whole nation anticipated, Zaheer Khan was OUT. It was once again a perfect seam-up delivery for a new batsman as Zaheer edged it to Sangakkara. The wicketkeeper made a full-length dive to complete Maharoof\u2019s hat-trick. Maharoof also went on to take 5 wickets in the match and walk away with the Man-of-the-Match trophy.\n\n5. Sangakkara\u2019s masterpiece takes Sri Lanka over the line against India\n\nAsia Cup 2014 \u2013 Bangladesh\n\nAfter the heart-break in the 2012 Asia Cup final in Dambulla, Sri Lanka had their worst ever Asia Cup in 2012. They lost every match in that tournament. After the disgrace in 2012 Sri Lanka came into the 2014 Asia Cup with a young captain in Angelo Mathews and so many youngsters in the squad. Contrastingly to the 2012 Asia Cup Sri Lanka won all matches in 2014 and emerged champions.\n\nOut of all the wins in this tournament the win against India at the Khan Shaheb Osman Ali Stadium in Fatullah stands out solely because of a masterpiece by a great player, Kumar Sangakkara.\n\nChasing a target of 265, openers Lahiru Thirimanne and Kusal Perera gave Sri Lanka a perfect start, scoring 80 runs for the first wicket. Coming in at his usual position No. 3, Sangakkara was able to start slowly as Kusal Perera at the other end was batting nicely. With his wicket, when Sangakkara was on 27, Sri Lanka started losing wickets at regular intervals. Both Mahela Jayawardena and Dinesh Chandimal were dismissed in the same over by Ravindra Jadeja. Through all this Sangakkara stood firm at the other end accumulating runs and slowly inching towards the required target.\n\nDuring the cause Sangakkara managed to help young Chathuranga de Silva and Thisara Perera hang around to put on valuable 32 and 42 run partnerships for the 7th and 8th wickets respectively. Sangakkara who recorded his 18th ODI ton in this match and single handedly won the match for Sri Lanka. Although he was dismissed in the 49th over, Sri Lanka were almost over the line thanks to his 83-ball century. Thisara Perera and Ajantha Mendis then made sure that Sanga\u2019s effort didn\u2019t go in vain as they put the final touches to a famous Sri Lankan win against India by 2 wickets with 4 balls remaining."}]}
