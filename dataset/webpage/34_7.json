It became the biggest of all the states of that time. It was as big as northern states put together. It reached a maximum size by about 600 BC, and fortresses were built to consolidate the border against the northern Qi State and Jin State.\n\nFortresses were built to conform to the natural terrain, and walls were built to link the fortresses. The walls were not as complex or finely built as the Ming Dynasty Great Wall most tourists are aware of. These were built of whatever material was available in a locale. If dirt was available, it was packed on top of a ridgeline, and it was made likewise with any available rock.\n\nThe Chu State Wall and the Qi State Wall are very similar in location and function, and questions remain as to who built and owned what.\n\nDuring the Warring States Period (476\u2013221 BC) that followed, the Qin State started its westward military conquests. During this time, the Chu added about 150 kilometers to their wall. In 223, the Qin conquered Chu by a surprise attack.\n\nThe Chu's Great Wall was called 'Square Wall' (Fangcheng) or 'Bend Wall' (\u5f2f\u57ce Wancheng) Cheng because the wall took the shape of a square with the bottom side, nearest to the Yangtze River, missing.\n\nAfter the fall of the Chu State, the Qin Empire erected a Great Wall along its northern border, and the Chu wall fell into disrepair. Now all that is left is rubble in some places. Remains of the Chu Great Wall were discovered in Henan Province in 1902.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisiting the Chu Square Wall Ruins\n\nYou can tour the Chu Great Wall with China Highlights private transport.

It belonged to the larger polities that were able to survive until the end of the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE). Chu is known for its culture that was significantly different from that of the states of the Central Plain. Chu was not among the states that were distributed as a regional states at the beginning of the Western Zhou period \u897f\u5468 (11th cent.-770 BCE). Its ruling dynasty was of a different origin than most of the regional dynasties of the Zhou empire. Another name of Chu is Jing \u834a. Chu was first located in the valley of the River Han \u6f22 and then moved southeast into the Yangtze Valley. During the Spring and Autumn period \u6625\u79cb (770 - 5th cent. BCE) it gradually expanded towards the north and east.\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Chu \u695a (11th cent. - 223 BCE) Map according to Tan Qixiang \u8c2d\u5176\u9aa7 (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji \u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u96c6. Chu was located in the middle course of the Yangtze River and gradually expanded to the east and northeast. It played the role of temporary ally for the states of Qi and Qin, before the latter dominated over all regional states and founded the empire of Qin. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe semi-barbarian state of Chu becomes part of the middle kingdom\n\nThe ruling house of Chu derived its descendancy from the mythical Emperor Zhuan Xu \u9853\u980a, himself being a grandson of the Yellow Emperor \u9ec3\u5e1d. Zhuan Xu's great-grandson Zhong Li \u91cd\u9ece was the minister for fire (huo zheng \u706b\u6b63) of the mythical Emperor Di Ku \u5e1d\u56b3. For his merits earned in office, Zhong Li was bestowed the name of Zhu Rong \u795d\u878d. He was sent out to punish the rebellious lord of the waters, Gong Gong \u5171\u5de5, but Zhu Rong/Zhong Li was unable to kill Gong Gong. Enraged about this failure, Emperor Di Ku executed Zhong Li and had his brother Wu Hui \u5433\u56de take over the duties as minister of fire. Wu Hui had six grandsons that were called Kun Wu \u6606\u543e, Shen Hu \u53c3\u80e1, Peng Zu \u5f6d\u7956, Hui Ren \u6703\u4eba, Ji Lian \u5b63\u9023 and an unnamed son that was given the family name of Cao \u66f9. Five branches of the family fell into oblivion, except the descendants of Ji Lian who adopted the family name of Xiong \u718a or Mi \u7f8b (originally written \u5b2d).\n\nExcavated objects from the late Warring States period prove that the reigning dynasty of Chu also bore the family name Yan \u9153. Mi Xiong allegedly took part in King Wu's \u5468\u6b66\u738b conquest of the Shang empire \u5546 (17th-11th cent. BCE).\n\nIn the early decades of the Zhou period, King Cheng of Zhou \u5468\u6210\u738b (r. 1116-1079 BCE) made the family Mi regional rulers over the country of Chu in the middle Yangtze valley. From that time on they adopted the family name Mi, yet the rulers retained the surname Xiong. Xiong might also be a prefix of the personal name worn by all members of the family. In the late 11th century King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b undertook several military campaigns against Chu during one of which he died, while his own army drowned in the River Han. The rulers of Chu called themselves \"king\" (wang \u738b) and therefore demonstrated that they were actually not part of the system of regional states of the Zhou empire.\n\nYu Xiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi \u718a\u7e79 settled near Mt. Jingshan \u834a\u5c71 (modern Nanzhang \u5357\u6f33, Hubei) and, after being appointed regional ruler (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) by King Cheng of Zhou, moved to Danyang \u4e39\u967d (modern Zigui \u79ed\u6b78, Hubei).\n\nViscount (zi \u5b50) Xiong Qu \u718a\u6e20 became aware that the house of Zhou was weakening and expanded his rule along the middle Yangtze valley up into the valley of River Han. He conquered the statelets of Yong \u5eb8 and Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5. He made his oldest song Wukang \u6bcb\u5eb7 king of Goutan \u53e5\u4eb6, his second son Zhihong \u646f\u7d05 king of E \u9102, and his youngest son Zhici \u57f7\u75b5 king of Yuezhang \u8d8a\u7ae0. Later on he feared that the king of Zhou would attack him because of the usurpation of the title of king and stripped his sons off their ranks as kings.\n\nAfter the death of Viscount Xiong Shuang \u718a\u971c his three sons indeed contended for the throne of Chu. The youngest son, Jixun \u5b63\u5f87 (Xiong Xun \u718a\u5f87), was finally able to occupy the throne. When Fen Mao \u86a1\u5192 (r. 758-741), also called Xiong Xun \u718a\u7734, died, his younger brother Xiong Tong \u718a\u901a assassinated the heir apparent and usurped the throne. He is posthumously called King Wu of Chu \u695a\u6b66\u738b (r. 741-690) because he carried out numerous military campaigns, like that against the statelet of Sui \u96a8, whose marquis, hoping to escape defeat, offered to Xiong Tong to travel to the court of the King of Zhou to reconfirm Xiong Tong in his royal position, but the King of Zhou declined. Enraged about the King of Zhou's refusal, Xiong Tong decided to adopt the title of king without the permission by the Son of Heaven, concluded an alliance with the marquis of Sui and occupied the territory of the hundred Pu tribes \u767e\u6fee south of the Yangtze River. Xiong Tong later suspected the marquis of Sui of treason and planned to occupy his territory, but he died en route to the battlefield.\n\nHis son Xiong Zi \u718a\u8cb2 mounted the throne. Zi is posthumously known as King Wen \u695a\u6587\u738b (r. 690-677). He was the first ruler of Chu who took residence in Ying \u90e2 (near modern Shashi \u6c99\u5e02, Hubei) instead of Danyang. Xiong Zi conquered several small states, like Xi \u606f (modern Xixian \u606f\u7e23\uff0c Henan), Shen \u7533 (modern Nanyang \u5357\u967d, Henan) and Deng \u9127 (modern Xiangfan \u8944\u6a0a, Hubei). His son Zhuang'ao \u838a\u6556 (ao was a kind of temple name, like the Chinese zong \u5b97), known as Xiong Jian \u718a\u56cf (also written \u718a\u8271), planned to kill his brother Xiong Yun \u718a\u60f2 (also written \u718a\u9835), but the latter escaped to Sui and gained sufficient support to usurp the throne of his brother. Xiong Yun is posthumously known as King Cheng \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 672-626). Unlike his predecessors, King Cheng was a peaceful ruler who sent appropriate tributes to the court of the king of Zhou, so that he was ordered to appease the barbarian tribes of the south instead of harassing the states in the Yellow River plain.\n\nIn 656 the hegemonial lord (ba \u9738) Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) attacked Chu, but King Cheng was able to urge his troops to stop and concluded a peace alliance (meng \u76df) in the conference of Zhaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan). In his later years King Cheng waged war against the statelets of Xu \u8a31, Xian \u5f26 (near modern Xixian, Henan), Huang \u9ec3 (modern Huanchuan \u6f62\u5ddd, Henan) and Ying \u82f1. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637), the new hegemonial lord, dispatched an envoy to Chu to offer a peaceful alliance, but the king refused and soon attacked Song \u5b8b and defeated the duke in the battle of Hong \u6cd3 (modern Zhecheng \u67d8\u57ce, Henan) and also the state of Zheng \u912d. Duke Xiang died from a wound received during the battle.\n\nIn 634 Duke Xi of Lu \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) arrived at the court of Chu and requested an army to punish the Duke of Qi \u9f4a. King Cheng sent out the Marquis of Shen \u7533 who conquered the territory of Gu \u7a40, where Duke Huan's son Yong \u96cd was instated as the local governor. The other sons of the Duke of Qi fled to Chu and were all made nobles in Chu. The statelet of Kui \u5914 was conquered, and then King Cheng attacked the state of Song. The Duke of Song requested support by the army of Jin \u6649. King Cheng thereupon withdrew because Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628), had been his exiled guest for a long time, and sent only out Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 with a small contingent that was defeated.\n\nAgainst the advice of Prime Minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Zishang \u5b50\u4e0a, King Chen nominated his beloved son Shangchen \u5546\u81e3 heir apparent. Later on he deposed Shangchen in favour to Zhi \u8077. Shangchen thereupon arrested King Cheng and forced him to commit suicide. He mounted the throne, posthumously called King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 626-614). His chief counsellor was Pan Chong \u6f58\u5d07. King Mu conquered the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f (modern Xixian, Henan) and Lu \u516d (a special reading, modern Lu'an \u516d\u5b89, Anhui) and attacked the state of Chen \u9673.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son L\u00fc \u4fb6, who is posthumously known as King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 614-591). King Zhuang did not attend the court, indulged in pleasures and even ordered to execute those who dared remonstrating against him. Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 thereupon used a riddle to admonish him, but without success. Only Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e was able to open the king's eyes so that he started caring for political matters again. During his campaign against the Rong barbarians \u620e of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, King Zhuang visited the capital of the kings of Zhou in Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan) and was received by royal grandson Man \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff. The latter convinced him that the Heavenly Mandate (tianming \u5929\u547d) of the Zhou dynasty had not yet ended, in spite of the obvious weakness of the royal house.\n\nIn 597 Chu defeated the army of Jin near Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan). In 594 Chu besieged the capital of Song for five months and conquered the statelet of Yong \u5eb8 (near modern Zhushan \u7af9\u5c71, Hubei), later Shu-Liao \u8212\u84fc (modern Shucheng \u8212\u57ce, Anhui) and Xiao \u856d (near modern Xuzhou \u5f90\u5dde, Jiangsu).\n\nAfter the conquest of Chen, King Zhuang wanted to transform it into a district of Chu, but Shen Shu \u7533\u53d4 of Qi criticized the king, so that he reinstated the house of Chen. Yet his next step was to conquer the state of Zheng. After the lord of Zheng had begged for mercy, King Zhuang released him and created an alliance of peace. In 575 the army of Chu defeated the relieve army from Jin in the battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan). The rule of King Zhuang is seen as the apogee of the power of the state of Chu among the regional states of the Zhou period. He was accepted as hegemonial lord (ba \u9738).\n\nKing Zhuang was succeeded by his son Shen \u5be9, posthumously known as King Gong \u695a\u5171\u738b (r. 591-560). During his reign the army of Chu was defeated by Jin. The next ruler was King Gong's son Zhao \u62db, posthumously known as King Kang \u695a\u5eb7\u738b (r. 560-545). The latter was succeeded by his son Yuan \u54e1, who is also known as Jia'ao \u90df\u6556 (r. 545-541). King Kang had four younger brothers called Wei \u570d, Zibi \u5b50\u6bd4, Zixi \u5b50\u6673 and Qiji \u5f03\u75be. Wei was made Prime Minister and commander of the army. When Jia'ao fell ill, Wei entered the palace, strangulated the king and killed his sons Mo \u83ab and Pingxia \u5e73\u590f. Zibi fled to Jin, while Wei mounted the throne. He is posthumously known as King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 541-529).\n\nChu as a major power of the Warring States\n\nKing Ling was able to assemble the regional rulers and to take over the lead as a factual hegemon of the regional states. Minister Wu Ju warned the king to become over-confident in his superior role, yet King Ling commanded the regional states in a campaign against the state of Wu \u5433. Qing Feng \u6176\u5c01, the commander of the troops of Wu, was kept prisoner, but dared criticizing King Ling for the way his fathers had come to the throne of Chu, and was therefore immediately executed by the king. He had the Zhanghua Terrace \u7ae0\u83ef\u81fa built where he received noble refugees from other states. Prince Qiji was ordered to attack the state of Chen, and King Ling invited the marquis of Cai \u8521 in order to poison him. Prince Qiji conquered the headless state of Cai and usurped the throne of the small marquisate.\n\nIn 530 BCE, King Ling attacked the small state of Xu \u5f90, located northwest of the state of Wu, and Lai \u8cf4 (modern Suizhou \u96a8\u5dde, Hubei). Chen was heavily deafeated and its dynasty brought to an end. At that moment, King Ling deliberated with his nobles whether he was strong enough to claim the same rights as the other regional rulers. Grand master (dafu \u5927\u592b) Xi Fu \u6790\u7236 answered that in old times, the state of Chu had been a very remote and less developed country, but now the King of Zhou would not refuse to bestow to the King of Chu bronze tripods as a symbol of royal power, and none of the other states would refuse to exchange gifts with the state of Chu.\n\nWhen King Ling was on campaign against Wu in the camp of Ganxi \u4e7e\u6eaa, the king of Wu was advised by Guan Cong \u89c0\u5f9e, a son of a noble of Cai whom King Ling had killed. The King of Wu joined a secret alliance with the state of Yue \u8d8a, whose nobleman Chang Shouguo \u5e38\u58fd\u904e had also been insulted by the king of Chu. Wu and Yue attacked Cai and won over Qiji, who was able to kill the heir apparent of Chu, Prince Lu \u797f. Zibi was enthroned as king of Chu, Zixi was made Prime Minister, and Qiji Minister of War (sima \u53f8\u99ac). Guan Cong thereupon travelled to the camp of King Ling and presented him with the facts of the rebellion at home. The army of Chu dispersed and left the king alone. King Ling wandered around in the wilderness and finally died of hunger because the new ruler had forbidden giving him anything to eat.\n\nThe new king, Zibi, was for a long time in an unclear state about the whereabouts of King Ling, and finally committed suicide, together with Zixi. Qiji renamed himself Xiong Ju \u718a\u5c45 and proclaimed himself king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 527-516).\n\nIn fear of revenge, King Ping demonstrated a benevolent government towards the common people and restored the territories of the states of Chen and Cai, enthroning members of the former ruling houses. The eastern parts of Chu were plundered by the armies of Wu during this interlude of internal war in Chu.\n\nKing Ping decided to marry his son, Crown Prince Jian \u5efa, with a princess from Qin \u79e6. Yet the girl was so beautiful that the king decided to take her for himself, and she gave birth to Prince Zhen \u8eeb. Grand Tutor (taifu \u592a\u5085) Wu She \u4f0d\u5962 and Junior Tutor (shaofu \u5c11\u5085) Fei Wuji \u8cbb\u7121\u5fcc intrigued against each other and instigated in the king the fear that the crown prince might prematurely usurp the throne. Prince Jian thereupon fled to the court of Song. Wu She's son Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5, who was an excellent strategist, was able to escape to the state of Wu, the arch-enemy of Chu.\n\nThe mother of Prince Jian was captured by the army of Wu when Prince Guang \u5149 of Wu was campaigning against Chen and Cai. A small border clash in Beiliang \u5351\u6881 lead to an armed conflict between Chu and Wu, in which Wu conquered the territories of Zhongli \u9418\u96e2 and Juchao \u5c45\u5de2. King Ping was so threatened that he began fortifying the capital city Ying. When King Ping died, the nobles wanted to enthrone his younger brother Prince Zixi \u5b50\u897f, but he refused, so that the under-age prince Zhen was enthroned as ruler of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489).\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Prime Minister Zichang \u5b50\u5e38 took revenge for Prince Jian and Wu She and killed the intriguer Fei Wuji. The reason for this was that a many nobles had fled to Wu, where they supported the troops of Chu against the own dynasty in Chu. Yet there were also some princes of Wu escaping trouble in the own country at the court of Chu.\n\nIn 509 BCE the army of Chu, commanded by Prince Zichang, was heavily defeated by Wu in the battle of Baiju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). Wu Zixu as one of the competent military leaders of Wu even managed to conquer the capital of Chu in 506. As a revenge for the execution of his father, Wu Zixu had the tomb of King Ping desecrated. Commander Prince Zichang fled to the state of Zheng. King Zhao himself escaped to Yunmeng \u96f2\u5922 and then on to the former state of Sui, where he was hidden by his loyal courtiers and the population from the army of Wu.\n\nIn the meantime, minister Shen Baoxu \u7533\u9b91\u80e5 was sent to the state of Qin to ask for relief troops, which were indeed able to defeat the troops of Wu that had advanced far into the country of the enemy until they reached Ji \u7a37 (modern Tongbai \u6850\u67cf, Henan). Prince Fugai \u592b\u6982, brother of the king of Wu, usurped the throne on this occasion but was driven out by the righteous king and fled to the court of Chu.\n\nStill on his way back to the capital, King Zhao of Chu swallowed the state of Tang \u5510 (near modern Suizhou, Hubei), then Dun \u9813 (modern Shangshui \u5546\u6c34, Henan) and Hu \u80e1 (modern Fuyang \u961c\u967d, Anhui). There was another occasion in 504 when the army of Wu again invaded the state of Chu. Only with the death of King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad of Wu (r. 514-496) the attention of Wu was directed against the state of Yue, and the danger from the east was gone.\n\nOn his sickbed, King Zhao wanted to cede the throne to his younger brother, yet all nobles refused, before Prince Zil\u00fc \u5b50\u95ad conceded to become the successor of his brother. Yet when the King died on a campaign, the brothers decided to enthrone the king's son, Prince Zhang \u7ae0. He is posthumously known as King Hui \u695a\u60e0\u738b (r. 489-432). In 488 Prince Zixi invited the former Prince Jian's son Prince Sheng \u52dd to come back to Chu. He was granted the title of Duke Bai \u767d\u516c. Duke Bai planned to revenge his father's death, who had been killed in exile in Zheng.\n\nIn 481 BCE, the army of Jin attacked Zheng, and Zheng asked Chu for help. Instead of annihilating Zheng, commander Zixi left Zheng untouched. Duke Bai thereupon killed Zixi, Prince Ziqi \u5b50\u7da6 and Prime Minister Sima Ziqi \u53f8\u99ac\u5b50\u671f at the court and tried to kidnap King Hui. Yet the king was protected by his retainers and took refuge in the palace of the Queen Dowager of King Zhao.\n\nDuke Bai thereupon proclaimed himself king, but was assassinated by Prince Zigao \u5b50\u9ad8, called Duke Ye \u8449\u516c. In this year, Chu finally destroyed the state of Chen, in 447 the state of Cai, and in 445 the state of Qi \u675e.\n\nIn 473, the armies of Yue had finally destroyed the state of Wu. In the northern parts of Wu, along the plain of the River Huai \u6dee, Chu began to expand its territory. King Hui was succeeded by his son Prince Zhong \u4e2d, who is posthumously known was King Jian \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. 432-408). Under his reign, Chu conquered the statelet of Ju \u8392 (modern Juxian \u8392\u7e23, Shandong) that had belonged to the territory of Qi. King Jian employed the famous military advisor Wu Qi \u5433\u8d77, who reformed the army, so that Chu was able to conquer the southern regions inhabited by the non-Chinese peoples of the Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5, namely the Dongting \u6d1e\u5ead (Hunan) and Cangwu \u84bc\u68a7 (Guizhou) regions.\n\nKing Jian was succeeded by his son Prince Dang \u7576, posthumously known as King Sheng \u695a\u8072\u738b (r. 408-402). King Sheng was killed by \"robbers\" (presumably nobles or family members) and was succeeded by his son Prince Yi \u7591, posthumously known as King Dao \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. 402-381). Under his reign, Chu contended with the troops of the new states of Han \u97d3, Zhao \u8d99 and Wei \u9b4f, the successor states of Jin. King Dao was succeeded by his son Prince Zang \u81e7, posthumously known as King Su \u695a\u8085\u738b (r. 381-370). Because King Su had no sons, he left the throne to his younger brother Prince Liangfu \u826f\u592b, who is posthumously known as King Xuan \u695a\u5ba3\u738b (r. 370-340). At the end of the latter's reign, the armies of Qin attacked Chu. At that time, Qin was governed by counsellor Shang Yang \u5546\u9785.\n\nKing Xuan's son Prince Shang \u5546 succeeded to the throne in Chu, posthumously known as King Wei \u695a\u5a01\u738b (r. 340-329). He was able to defeat the armies of the state of Qi, which was at that time disturbed by inner quarrels. King Wei also defeated the armies of the kingdom of Yue and occupied a large part of its territory, so that Chu was now the sole state in the southern parts of China. In 306, Yue was destroyed by Chu.\n\nChu as a large but weak state between Qin and Qi\n\nWhen King Wei died, the state of Wei used this opportunity and conquered part of its northern territory. King Wei's successor was his son Prince Guai \u69d0, posthumously known as King Huai \u695a\u61f7\u738b (r. 329-299). In 323 BCE he took revenge and attacked the territory of Wei, seizing eight counties. The next military target was the state of Qi, yet at that time the military adviser Chen Zhen \u9673\u8eeb dwelled at the court of Qi and was dispatched to the camp of counsellor Zhao Yang \u662d\u967d, highest commander of the army of Chu. Chen Zhen persuaded Zhao Yang with the parable of drawing feet to a snake that he would have no advantage in defeating the army of Qi, so that Zhao Yang withdrew. At least, Chu was able to conclude an alliance with the states of Qin, Wei and Qi that was initiated by the famous diplomatist Zhang Yi \u5f35\u5100.\n\nThis alliance became important in 318 BCE, when an alliance, concluded with the help of Su Qin \u8607\u79e6, attacked the state of Qin. King Huai took over the lead of the allies and penetrated into the Hangu Pass \u51fd\u8c37\u95dc, yet the allies withdrew without forcing Qin to battle.\n\nIn 313, things had changed and Chu was in alliance with Qi. The king of Qin decided to send Zhang Yi to Chu in order to persuade King Huai to change side again and, in the end, to isolate Chu. Chen Zhen was well aware of this and warned King Huai, but he refused to accept the warning. In the end, the enraged king of Qi concluded an alliance with Qin. King Huai, on his side, made ready the troops for a campaign against Qin. Again, Chen Zhen warned the king and suggested offering Qin a city to restore the former alliance. King Huai ignored the warning, and so the army of Qin destroyed that of Chu at Danyang \u4e39\u967d in 312, captured a huge humber of troops and officers, and occupied the region of Hanzhong \u6f22\u4e2d. At Lantian \u85cd\u7530, the armies battled a second time, and the fresh defeat of Chu instigated Han and Wei to seize some more territory from Chu.\n\nA year later, Qin suggested concluding peace and sent Zhang Yi to the court of Chu. King Huai immediately arrested Zhang Yi and planned to kill him, but Zhang established contact with Jin Shang \u9773\u5c1a, who explained to King Huai that Qin would attack Chu again. He also spoke with the King's favourite, Lady Zheng Xiu \u912d\u8896, and threatened her that the king of Qin would try to purchase peace by sending beautiful girls to King Huai. The Lady then managed the release of Zhang Yi, and peace was made with Qin. Shortly after, the Chu embassador to Qi returned, Qu Yuan \u5c48\u539f, and reproached the king for not having executed Zhang Yi.\n\nIn 310 BCE, the King Min of Qi \u9f4a\u6e63\u738b (r. 324-284) sent an envoy to the court of Chu and explained that, after the death of King Hui in Qin, the situation had changed thoroughly, and suggested to conclude a common alliance with Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan \u71d5 against Qin. Zhao Ju \u662d\u96ce convinced King Huai that it was better to be part of the alliance around Qi and to win back the territory once lost to Qin. Yet in 307, King Huai decided that he could also win territory by concluding a peaceful alliance with Qin. Two years later Qin, Han and Wei attacked Chu for its betrayal of the alliance. King Huai sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qin and requested military support against the three states.\n\nIn 304, the crown prince of Chu had a private quarrel with some nobles of Qin. When he accidentally killed one of them, he fled and returned to Chu. In order to take revenge for the murder, Qin attacked Chu, supported by troops of Qi, Han and Wei, and defeated Chu at Chuisha \u5782\u6c99. A year later, Qin undertook a second campaign against Chu and heavily defeated the army of Chu. King Huai thereupon sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qi, an ally of Qin, and requested peace.\n\nOnly after a further campaign and after King Zhao of Qin had sent an urgent letter, King Huai of Chu consented to a meeting with the king of Qin at the Wuguan Pass \u6b66\u95dc. Yet King Huai did not trust Qin and feared that he might be caught in a trap. Zhao Ju suggested not to meet the king of Qin, but the King's younger son urged him to go. In the end, King Huai was escorted to Xianyang \u54b8\u967d, the capital of Qin, and was threatened to cease territory before concluding an alliance. He refused and was arrested and detained.\n\nAt home, the situation was precarious. Both the king and the crown prince were held hostages in Qin, and Zhao Ju argued that it was against etiquette to enthrone a younger son as long as the ruler was living. This meant that there was no head of government as long as King Huai was in Qin. The court brooded over the issue and finally invited Prince Heng \u6a6b to come to the capital Ying. He was enthroned as king of Ch, posthumously known as King Qingxiang \u695a\u9803\u8944\u738b (r. 299-263).\n\nThe king of Qin thereupon continued his campaigning against Chu, defeated its army, and seized territory in the north. A year later, King Huai managed to escape, but because the roads to Chu were blocked by Qin, he fled to the state of Zhao, but fearing the anger of Qin, King Huiwen of Zhao \u8d99\u60e0\u6587\u738b (r. 299-266) refused to offer protection. King Huai was finally captured by the bloodhounds of Qin and brought back to Xianyang, where he died a year later. At least, his corpse was allowed to be transferred back to his native state, where he was buried with greatest honours.\n\nIn 293 BCE, general Bai Qi \u767d\u8d77 massacred the army of Han. Threatened by this cruel way of warfare, King Qingxiang agreed to conclude a marriage of peace with Qin. This new alliance led to a campaign in 284, carried out by Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan and targeted against the state of Qi in the east. Chu so regained the region of Huaibei \u6dee\u5317. In 281, King Qingxiang was persuaded to resume war against Qin, in order to gain more territory. He first concluded an alliance with Qin and Han and planned to use this opportunity to conquer some territory of the patriarchal kings of Zhou around Luoyang. King Nan of Zhou \u5468\u738b\u8d67 (r. 315-256) thereupon sent his relative, Duke Wu \u6b66\u516c, to Zhaozi \u662d\u5b50, the counsellor of Chu. Duke Wu explained to Zhaozi that the destruction of the house of Zhou meant a thorough dissolution of the world order and would bring only chaos to the state of Chu. King Qingxiang thereupon abandoned this plan.\n\nThe campaigns against Qin continued, but in 278 BCE, general Bai Qi advanced to the capital of Chu and defiled the tombs of the kings of Chu. The capital of Chu was moved to the ancient site of Chen (modern Huaiyang \u6dee\u967d, Henan) It was only in 276 that the army of Chu was able to recover some of its core territory. Chu was even able to supporte Han, Zhao and Wei in a campaign against Yan. This was only possible because of an armistice bargained with Qin, covered by the crown prince as a hostage dwelling in Qin.\n\nWhen King Qingxiang fell ill, his son Prince Xiong Yuan \u718a\u5143 (or Wan \u5b8c) managed to escape from Qin and was enthroned as the new king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Kaolie \u695a\u8003\u70c8\u738b (r. 263-238). The new king immediately appointed his trusted Counsellor-to-the-Left (zuoxi \u5de6\u5f92), Lord Chunshen \u6625\u7533\u541b, as Prime Minister. Under the Lord's administration, the state of Chu was able to recover for a while. The capital was first shifted to Juyang \u5de8\u967d (modern Taihe \u592a\u548c, Anhui), later to to Shouchun \u58fd\u6625 (modern Shouxian \u58fd\u7e23, Anhui) further to the east. Lord Chunshen met with Lord Xinling \u4fe1\u9675\u541b of Wei and forged an alliance that was able to defeat Qin in 257. A year later, Chu conquered the state of Lu.\n\nKing Kaolie was succeeded by his son Prince Dao \u608d (or Yu \u715c), who is posthumously known as King You \u695a\u5e7d\u738b (r. 238-228). Li Yuan \u674e\u5712, a powerful noble, used this personal change to assassinate Lord Chunshen. King You was succeeded by his younger half-brother You \u7336 (or Hao \u90dd), who is posthumously known as King Ai \u695a\u54c0\u738b (r. 228). He only ruled for two months before he was overthrown and killed by his older half-brother Fuchu \u8ca0\u82bb (r. 228-223).\n\nThe rule of the last kings of Chu was overshadowed by a growing military success of the state of Qin that succeedingly conquered the states of Han, Zhao and Wei. In 224, the Qin general Wang Jian \u738b\u7fe6 defeated the army of Chu and killed general Xiang Yan \u9805\u71d5, a great uncle of Xiang Yu \u9805\u7fbd, the eventual hegemonial king (bawang \u9738\u738b) of West Chu \u897f\u695a. A year later, Wang Jian and Meng Wu \u8499\u6b66 seized the capital of Chu, captured King Fuchu and transformed the state of Chu into a commandery of the state of Qin.\n\nThe name of Chu was often used as a name for imperial princedoms, and was one of the Ten States (Shiguo \u5341\u570b) in the 10th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

BCE) and was one of the so-called five hegemons (wuba \u4e94\u9738). His personal name was Mi Xiongl\u00fc \u8288\u718a\u4fb6 (also written \u718a\u5442 or \u718a\u65c5). The state of Chu is sometimes called Jing \u834a, and Xiongl\u00fc's posthumous title is also King Yan \u56b4\u738b.\n\nHe succeeded to the throne as son of King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614). King Zhuang started his reign in a style of laissez-faire politics without much caring for the government. His advisors Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 and Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e opened him his eyes, so that he started restructuring the administration and strengthening the royal power with the support of Sunshu Ao \u5b6b\u53d4\u6556. The state took over the care for hydraulic works, dykes and dams, he built up a strong army and quelled the internal rebellion of a certain Ruo Ao \u82e5\u6556 (not King Ruo Ao, r. 791-764). His armies marched to the north, defeated the state of Song \u5b8b and the Rong \u620e barbarians of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, and lined up before the domain of the king of Zhou \u5468.\n\nWith the awareness of his power King Zhuang of Chu menaced the King of Zhou and threatened him that Chu would be able to replace the house of Zhou. The armies of Chu then conquered a handfull of smaller states like Yong \u5eb8, Shu \u8212 and Chen \u9673, and in 602, King Zhuang was able to destroy the army of Jin \u6649 at Bi \u90b2 (modern Xingyang \u6ece\u967d, Henan). Chu thus came to replace Jin as the hegemonial power of the Central States.\n\nSource:\n\nCang Xiuliang \u5009\u4fee\u826f, ed. (1991).

Both textual and material evidence can be interpreted in different ways: hence, whereas some scholars insist that Chu was the cultural Other of the Zhou \u5468 world, other consider it an intrinsic part of the Zhou civilization. To complicate matters more, most of the Chu-related narratives in the transmitted texts were created in the northern part of the Zhou world, and are suspected to reflect \u201cnorthern biases,\u201dFootnote 1 which means that their reliability with regard to the self-image of Chu elites is doubtful.\n\nIt is on this backdrop that we can appreciate the importance of historical and quasi-historical manuscripts recently excavated (or looted) from the Chu tombs. By offering a Chu perspective of its history, they allow us to think anew about Chu's cultural trajectory. In what follows, after a brief outline of the debates over Chu's cultural belonging, I shall survey the newly discovered manuscripts and evaluate their impact on the ongoing research concerning Chu identity.\n\nPREFACE: THE QUESTION OF CHU'S OTHERNESS Traditional scholars were overwhelmingly inclined to view Chu as the cultural Other of the Zhou world. The reasons for this verdict are not difficult to find. Already some of the Western Zhou \u897f\u5468 (ca. 1046\u2013771 BCE) sources indicate considerable enmity between the Zhou realm and the state of Chu. The most notable manifestation of this enmity were campaigns of King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b (r. 975\u2013957 BCE) against Chu in ca. 960\u2013957 BCE. The latter of these campaigns ended in the disastrous loss of royal armies; and the king himself perished. The memory of this humiliation lived for centuries.Footnote 2 Tensions between Zhou and Chu continued into the reign of King Xuan of Zhou \u5468\u5ba3\u738b (r. 828\u2013781 BCE). The ode \u201cPlucking White Millet\u201d (Cai qi \u91c7\u8291) in the Canon of Poems (Shijing \u8a69\u7d93) hails a minister of King Xuan who allegedly invaded and overawed the \u201cSavage Jing\u201d (man Jing \u883b\u834a). Whether or not this term refers to the state of Chu (which often appears under the name Jing or Jing-Chu in early sources) or to other tribesmen of the Han \u6f22 and middle Yangzi basin is debatable,Footnote 3 but elsewhere the Canon of Poems seems to unmistakably signify the state of Chu as a major enemy. Two of the Lu \u9b6f and Shang \u5546 (probably Song \u5b8b) hymns contain references to battles with the Jing-Chu, which, in a Lu hymn, is placed unequivocally aside the alien tribesmen Rong and Di \u620e\u72c4.Footnote 4 These hymns probably date from the Springs-and-Autumns period (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb, 770-453 BCE), yet they do indicate that the tradition of political cum cultural enmity toward Chu that started in the Western Zhou period continued and perhaps strengthened thereafter. Zuo zhuan \u5de6\u50b3 (Zuo Tradition), our major source for the history of the Springs-and-Autumns period, records the rise of Chu and its epic struggle for supremacy in the Zhou world against the northern coalitions, led first by Qi \u9f4a and then by Jin \u6649. A superficial reading of Zuo zhuan will lend support to identification of Chu as a culturally distinct entity. A Lu minister's saying, \u201cThey are not of our kin, their heart must be different\u201d (\u975e\u6211\u65cf\u985e\uff0c\u5176\u5fc3\u5fc5\u7570), is commonly\u2014albeit erroneously\u2014interpreted as pertaining to Chu's \u201cracial\u201d otherness.Footnote 5 This interpretation is wrong, but Zuo zhuan does contain many other negative comments on Chu, which is perceived as a rival of the Xia \u590f entity centered around the Zhou royal clan. Thus, a Jin commander accuses Chu of eliminating many polities established by the Zhou royal clansmen (the Ji \u59ec clan);Footnote 6 and many of Chu leaders, from its prime-minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 (d. 632 BCE) to infamous King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 540\u2013529 BCE) are singled out as arrogant and aggressive statesmen eager to violate rules of ritual and propriety. All this often leaves an impression of the text's overall enmity toward Chu. A careful reading of Zuo zhuan shows that the picture is more complex. Chu is never treated in the text as the cultural Other: in distinction from other southern powers, such as Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a, Chu are never called manyi \u883b\u5937 (\u201csavages\u201d). Some Chu leaders are denigrated indeed, but others\u2014most notably King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613\u2013591 BCE)\u2014are given high respect. Moreover, some of the pejorative remarks about Chu in Zuo zhuan should be read cum grano salis. After all, the very state of Lu, whose statesman opposed relying on Chu who \u201care not of our kin,\u201d was at times closely allied with Chu, seeking its military assistance against the neighboring power of Qi. And the elimination of Zhou clansmen's polities was performed not just by Chu but also by the self-proclaimed defender of the Zhou, the state of Jin.Footnote 7 Actually, some of the imperial readers considered Zuo zhuan too biased in favor of Chu; and some of the exegetes\u2014most notably Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200)\u2014opined that Zuo zhuan itself was a product of Chu historiography.Footnote 8 Going further in history, in many of the Warring States\u2013period (Zhanguo \u6230\u570b, 453\u2013221 BCE) texts we encounter ever more pronounced enmity toward Chu. In particular, its association with \u201cbarbarians\u201d becomes a commonplace. This association is reiterated throughout the Discourses of the States (Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e),Footnote 9 even though the overall view of Chu in this text is far from negative, and parts of it contain laudatory comments on Chu (see below). A pejorative view of Chu is more explicit in Gongyang zhuan \u516c\u7f8a\u50b3, a rival (to Zuo zhuan) commentary on the Springs-and-Autumns Annals (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb). Chu is consistently identified in the text as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d (yi \u5937 or yidi \u5937\u72c4) state; it is oddly claimed to have no ranked nobles (which is patently wrong, judging from the Annals\u2019 text itself), and it is frequently treated with undisguised enmity.Footnote 10 One of the Gongyang zhuan statements is particularly important because of its lasting influence on subsequent views of Chu: Chu is the last to submit when there is a True Monarch, and the first to rebel when there is none. They are barbarians (yidi) and immensely hate the Central States. When southern savages and northern barbarians established ties, the Central States were like a thread due to be cut. \u695a\u6709\u738b\u8005\u5247\u5f8c\u670d\uff0c\u7121\u738b\u8005\u5247\u5148\u53db\u3002\u5937\u72c4\u4e5f\uff0c\u800c\u4e9f\u75c5\u4e2d\u570b\uff0c\u5357\u5937\u8207\u5317\u72c4\u4ea4\u3002\u4e2d\u570b\u4e0d\u7d55\u82e5\u7dda\u3002.Footnote 11 This statement\u2014coming from amid one of the most famous passages in the entire Gongyang zhuan\u2014set the framework for discussions of Chu political and cultural position within the Zhou world for millennia to come. It marked Chu as the epitome of the cultural Other, the malevolent polity which can be subjugated only under the reign of the True Monarch, and even then will forever remain prone to rebel. Coupled with a few other pejorative statements toward Chu, e.g., in Mengzi \u5b5f\u5b50 and the Records of the Historian (Shiji \u53f2\u8a18),Footnote 12 the Gongyang zhuan denigration of Chu attained the position of an orthodox view in traditional Chinese scholarship. The traditional view of Chu as a distinct cultural entity was reinforced in the last quarter of the twentieth century, as many discoveries from the Chu tombs brought to light the peculiar, \u201cflamboyant\u201dFootnote 13 style of its mortuary objects. Lothar von Falkenhausen observed: \u201cDazzled by these unique archeological treasures, many scholars and impressionable laypersons had been clinging to the romantic notion that Chu was a separate southern civilization, an elegant and exuberant other to the dour, disciplined Zhou in the north.\u201dFootnote 14 Yet this view of Chu as an \u201calternative civilization\u201d was questioned later in view of subsequent archeological discoveries. The new understanding, summarized by Xu Shaohua in the seminal volume by Constance A. Cook and John S. Major is that \u201cthere is little archeological evidence of a distinctive Chu culture during the Western Zhou times.\u201dFootnote 15 It was only from the Springs-and-Autumns period on that a divergent cultural pattern associated with Chu began emerging, and even then Chu's elite culture remained strongly conformant with the Zhou ritual practices.Footnote 16 This suggests an entirely different cultural trajectory: Chu was not a \u201cbarbarian entity\u201d attracted by the glory of the Zhou culture as hinted in the Mengzi,Footnote 17 but a normative Zhou polity that developed cultural assertiveness in tandem with the increase in its political power.Footnote 18 The difficulty of analyzing Chu's identity derives not only from the complexity of its cultural trajectory but also from the nature of our textual sources. The overwhelming majority of Chu-related accounts in transmitted texts come from the histories produced outside the state of Chu. The Springs-and-Autumns Annals and their commentaries were composed in the states of Lu and Qi; most of the Discourses of the States come from the Zhou royal domain, Lu, and Jin; and so is the case of most of historical anecdotes scattered throughout the Warring States\u2013period texts. While the Chu sections of the Discourses of the States and of Stratagems of Warring States (Zhanguo ce \u6230\u570b\u7b56), as well as segments of Zuo zhuan, may well have incorporated original Chu materials, we have no idea about the degree of editorial intervention by northern compilers in these materials. Look for instance at the Records of the Historian, our major source for pre-imperial history. Even those who do not subscribe to the accusation of Sima Qian \u53f8\u99ac\u9077 (ca. 145\u2013ca. 90 BCE) as the one who \u201cdescribes Chu in the imperialist terms of a northerner,\u201dFootnote 19 would not deny the obvious northern bias in his\u2014and other historical\u2014writings. This consideration should dictate utmost caution in reading these texts. To accept, for instance, the self-identification of Chu as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d polity on the basis of citations in the Discourses of the States and Records of the Historian,Footnote 20 strikes me as a haphazard conclusion. It is on this backdrop that we can appreciate the import of the newly unearthed historical and quasi-historical manuscripts from the state of Chu. These materials comprise several dozen historical anecdotes, a semi-legendary history (Rongchengshi \u5bb9\u6210\u6c0f), a sketchy history of Chu's capitals and royal palaces (Chuju \u695a\u5c45), and a more detailed Chu-focused history of inter-state relations from the eleventh to the early fourth century BCE (Xinian \u7e6b\u5e74). An integrative view of these materials may yield a novel perspective of Chu's self-image. That history writing was\u2014and is\u2014commonly utilized to articulate, strengthen, or shape the collective identity of a cultural, ethnic, or political entity is almost a truism. To be sure, this is just one of a means of strengthening or constructing a separate cultural or political identity, and not necessarily the major one. Yet, the importance of history writing with this regard, especially insofar as the educated segments of the population are concerned, is undeniable.Footnote 21 Paul R. Goldin noted that the emergence of local histories in the Eastern Zhou \u6771\u5468 (770\u2013256 BCE) period may be related to the nascent sense of regional identity.Footnote 22 In what follows I shall check whether or not this observation is valid for the state of Chu. How much do Chu historical texts reflect its separate cultural identity or contribute toward its formation? Do they polemicize with the denigration of Chu's culture in the northern texts? Do they bolster the Chu kings\u2019 legitimacy as potential leaders of All-under-Heaven? Do they present a different picture of Chu's relations with the Zhou polities from the one we have in the received texts? Do they use such common means of strengthening collective identity as focusing on Chu's wars with its rivals, glorifying its victories and lamenting its defeats? By answering these questions I hope to advance toward better understanding both of the issues related to the formation of Chu's identity and of the role of history-writing in the cultural processes during the Zhou era.\n\nCHU HISTORICAL ANECDOTES Didactic anecdotes\u2014short vignettes valued for their edifying messages\u2014are ubiquitous in pre-imperial writings. They permeate most texts later classified as either \u201chistories\u201d (like Discourses of the States and Stratagems of the Warring States), or \u201cphilosophies\u201d (e.g., Han Feizi \u97d3\u975e\u5b50, or L\u00fcshi chunqiu \u5442\u6c0f\u6625\u79cb), and even some of the \u201cclassics\u201d (e.g., Zuo zhuan).Footnote 23 The anecdotes figure prominently in the Shanghai Museum collection of Chu manuscripts, of which they constitute more than a half of the heretofore published titles; they are present, albeit less prominently, among the Chu manuscripts possessed by Qinghua (Tsinghua) University; and a few of them appear in other collections of Chu materials.Footnote 24 It is therefore appropriate to start our discussion of Chu historiography with the survey of these anecdotes. Since the lion's share of the anecdotes comes from the Shanghai Museum collection, I shall focus in what follows on this collection only.Footnote 25 One striking feature of the anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection is what Sarah Allan called their \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d content.Footnote 26 According to Allan's count, of twenty-four vignettes, thirteen come from Chu while the rest are spread throughout most of the Zhou world, coming from Lu (four), Qi (four), and one each from Jin, Zheng \u912d, and Wu \u5433. My own count differs slightly from Allan's, primarily because I count two anecdotes embedded in the same manuscript separately, and also because I follow rearrangements of slips into a different sequence of manuscripts as proposed by a few later redactors.Footnote 27 Yet the differences are minuscule. Putting aside multiple anecdotes related to Confucius and his disciples, we may summarize that Chu vignettes constitute just slightly over 60 percent of the anecdotes in the Shanghai Museum collection and the percentage will further decrease should we add anecdotes from another sites and collections, which are overwhelmingly non-Chu in their focus.Footnote 28 This allows an immediate observation: members of the Chu educated elite who took anecdotes with them to the final journey to the netherworld appear to be interested in the affairs of the entire Zhou realm rather than being narrowly focused on their own country. The next question will be: to what extent the Chu-related anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection represent aspects of Chu political or cultural identity? To facilitate the discussion of this question I have briefly summarized the content of the anecdotes in Table 1 below. Fifteen Chu anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection cover almost two centuries of Chu history: the earliest (#12) is related to the events of 633 BCE (on the eve of the Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee battle), while the latest (#3) dates from the time of King Jian of Chu \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. ca. 431-405 BCE).Footnote 29 These eventful centuries witnessed the rise of Chu hegemony and a few severe setbacks, glorious victories and disastrous defeats, periods of domestic stability and of woeful turmoil. One may expect that these events will be at the focus of Chu historians\u2019 interest, but this is not the case. Of major battles, for instance, only two are mentioned in the anecdotes, and even they are given a marginal place in the narrative. The Chengpu battle of 632 BCE in which Chu lost its hegemony to the newly rising power of Jin is the backdrop of anecdote #12; yet rather than focusing on the battle, the anecdote just tells a story of military incompetence of Chu's Prime Minster (lingyin) Ziyu \u5b50\u7389. The story closely parallels the Zuo zhuan narrativeFootnote 30 and the picture of Ziyu's inadequacy presented in it mirrors that in Zuo zhuan. That the Chengpu setback is all but glossed over is understandable; yet Chu's successes also generally do not attract the authors\u2019 attention. An exception is the Bi \u90b2 battle of 597 BCE in which King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613\u2013591 BCE) defeated the Jin armies and solidified his hegemony over the Zhou world. This battle\u2014or, more precisely, the events that led to it\u2014are at the center of anecdote #8. The narrative partly parallels Zuo zhuan but also departs from it in a few important details. Most notably, Chu's assault on Zheng which led to the Bi battle is presented as a punitive expedition against Prince Guisheng \u516c\u5b50\u6b78\u751f (aka Zijia \u5b50\u5bb6) of Zheng who assassinated his ruler, Lord Ling \u912d\u9748\u516c, in 605 BCE. This presentation is obviously biased in favor of Chu. As is clear from the very detailed depiction of these events in Zuo zhuan and elsewhere, King Zhuang's assault on Zheng in 597 BCE had nothing to do with penalizing Zijia, who was already dead by then and who in any case was posthumously chastened by Zheng leaders. The real reason for King Zhuang's assault on Zheng was to punish the perfidy of Zheng's rulers, who repeatedly switched allegiance from Chu to Jin and back to Chu. By replacing power consideration with the noble goal of punishing Zijia, the authors of the anecdote legitimate King Zhuang's assault on Zheng. The anecdote further implies that it is due to the king's morality and ritual correctness that he had subjugated Zheng and defeated the Jin army. So is it pure pro-Chu propaganda? Possibly yes, but not necessarily so. As Wei Cide noticed, the anecdote is less concerned with defending King Zhuang's actions, but, rather with the didactic conclusion: only morally justified military campaigns will meet with success.Footnote 31 Hence this anecdote cannot be considered a decisive manifestation of pro-Chu sentiments. Among other anecdotes, only one (#14) mentions military affairs of Chu, but this is done very briefly in the context of discussing correct military training; the list of successful campaigns of the past is not invoked to enhance the country's prestige. At times Chu's military successes are hinted at\u2014e.g., in anecdote #4\u2014but only as a backdrop for discussing the imminent danger of Chu's decline. In general, the anecdotes\u2019 authors are not much interested in Chu's past attainments and display no pride in the country's successes. When another expansionist ruler, King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 540\u2013529 BCE) is mentioned, this is done to reiterate his negative image as an arrogant and intemperate leader rather than to hail his achievements (anecdotes ##5 and 13). The major goal of the Chu-related anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection is not to glorify the militarily prominent Chu kings but rather to extol those monarchs who were able to heed remonstrance and mend their ways. Most of the remonstrance-focused anecdotes revolve around two of the least powerful Chu kings, King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 528\u2013516 BCE) and his son, King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 515\u2013489 BCE). The first of these rose to power in a fratricidal struggle which not only put an end to the reign of King Ling, but also caused a considerable decrease in Chu's international prestige, and the country's territorial contraction. King Zhao encountered an even greater disaster: an assault by Wu armies in 506 BCE caused him to flee the capital and put the entire country on the verge of collapse. As the weakest ruler on the throne of Chu during the period under discussion, King Zhao appears to be more prone than his predecessors or successors to heed remonstrance, mend his behavior, and tolerate criticism. These qualities are hailed in several anecdotes (##1, 2, 9). One's impression is that the authors of the anecdotes prefer weak and compliant kings to those who display extraordinary martial prowess but are also less tolerant of critical-minded aides. To summarize, Chu vignettes from the Shanghai Museum\u2014with the possible exception of anecdote #8\u2014appear to be unconcerned with the country's separate identity, its pride, its glorious past, and the like. Most of these anecdotes lack an identifiable Chu flavor: they could be placed in a different setting and with a different list of protagonists without altering their meaning.Footnote 32 In a few other cases\u2014such as anecdotes ##4 and 5 (which, to repeat, are part of the same manuscript)\u2014there is no doubt that the authors targeted exclusively a Chu audience, because both anecdotes presuppose a high level of knowledge of Chu history, without which they would remain barely comprehensible.Footnote 33 However, these anecdotes, much like the rest surveyed above, are devoid of any visible emphasis on Chu's cultural or political specifics. It may be justifiable to speak of them, and of the heretofore published Chu anecdotes in general, as \u201cidentity-neutral.\u201d This impression strengthens when we take into account non-Chu anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection and other materials from Chu tombs. Take for instance a manuscript named Wu ming \u5433\u547d, which revolves around a speech apparently delivered by the messenger of King Fuchai of Wu \u5433\u738b\u592b\u5dee (r. 495\u2013473 BCE) to the Zhou Son of Heaven.Footnote 34 The speech justifies Wu's ongoing war with Chu as defense of the Zhou house; Chu is accused of \u201cacting not in accordance with the Way\u201d (Jing [or Chu ren] wei bu Dao \u834a [or \u695a\u4eba] \u70ba\u4e0d\u9053, slips 4 and 9).Footnote 35 That this accusation appears in a speech attributed to one of Chu's staunchest foes is expectable; but that it is not qualified at all in an anecdote that circulated in the state of Chu, was transcribed into a Chu script, and was buried in a Chu tomb is surprising. The surprise becomes even greater when we notice the Chu manuscripts\u2019 attitudes to the figure of Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5 (d. 484 BCE). Wu Zixu, a son of a high minister of Chu who fell victim to slanderers and was executed by King Ping, vowed to avenge his father's death. He fled to the state of Wu and led its assault against Chu, bringing about Wu's occupation of Chu's capital, Ying, in 506. The occupation was a deeply humiliating and traumatic event; according to the Guliang Commentary (Guliang zhuan \u7a40\u6881\u50b3) on the Springs-and-Autumns Annals, it involved among other things desecration of King Ping's tomb and flogging his corpse.Footnote 36 Wu Zixu made a brilliant career in Wu, but later King Fuchai rejected his advice and ordered him to commit suicide. In due time, Wu Zixu became a paragon of loyalty entering the pantheon of righteous ministers who met an inglorious end.Footnote 37 This perspective, however, is decidedly non-Chu: after all, from the Chu point of view, Wu Zixu should be considered a major enemy, a murderous turncoat. Yet in two of the Chu manuscripts\u2014Poverty and Success are a Matter of Timing (Qiong da yi shi \u7aae\u9054\u4ee5\u6642) from the Guodian collection and Good Ministers (Liang chen \u826f\u81e3) from the Qinghua collection, Wu Zixu is hailed as a model minister without any mention of his anti-Chu deeds.Footnote 38 This latter example further strengthens my tentative conclusion: Chu historical anecdotes, as well as other historical and philosophical texts, lack any visible interest in Chu identity. Their Chu affiliation is marginal to their content. Their focus is decisively supra-regional: they concern the affairs of \u201cAll-under-Heaven\u201d and could be produced in any of the competing states.\n\nCHU JU Aside from multiple anecdotes, recent discoveries of Chu-related histories yielded a few lengthier texts, to which I shall turn now. One of these, Chu Residences (Chu ju \u695a\u5c45), from the first volume of the Qinghua collection, is the first known example of a pure Chu history. This brief text, transcribed on 14 slips, records Chu's history from the semi-legendary progenitor of the Chu royal lineage, Jilian \u5b63\u9023, down to King Dao of Chu \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. ca. 401\u2013381 BCE). It provides a few important details on the early history of Chu,Footnote 39 including, significantly, about the formation of its major aristocratic lineages.Footnote 40 However, as we enter the better known historical period (primarily the eighth century BCE and later), the narrative becomes very sketchy. Its only focus is on the changing location of the country's capitals, or, more precisely, of the ruler's palaces.Footnote 41 Almost no additional information is given: battles, domestic struggles, victories and defeats are all but absent, except in a few cases when they directly influenced the capital's location (for instance, the Ruoao \u82e5\u6556 lineage's revolt of 605 BCE, the Wu occupation of Chu's capital in 506 BCE, and the revolt of Duke of Bai \u767d\u516c in 479 BCE). Sensitive information is not necessarily concealed (as is the case with Xinian, discussed below); it is simply not considered essential. Chu ju is a puzzling text. Who were its audience? One may well read this sketchy, even if informative, text as an early version of a gaokao \u9ad8\u8003 material: a draft reply for an exam on Chu's historical geography. Speaking more seriously, I may speculate that this short survey of Chu's royal residences could be prepared specifically for foreigners in the service of Chu kings. Perhaps dwellings of former rulers possessed a certain ritual or cultic importance that should be clarified to a newcomer to the state of Chu. Maybe this was a kind of sensitive domestic information akin to local taboos and prohibitions which the foreigner should learn upon arrival?Footnote 42 Needless to say this assertion is currently impossible to verify. Chu ju is a useful source of information for those seeking to augment sketchy data in the received sources about early ancestors of the Chu royal lineage, and it contains seeds of heretofore unknown early dynastic legends, but these are less relevant to my discussion.Footnote 43 Here I want to focus on the opening lines of Chu ju, which narrate the story of the primeval ancestor of Chu, Jilian. The story tells: Jilian first descended at Mt. Wei, then arrived at Qiong Cave; advanced to depart from Mt. Qiao, making his dwelling at the Yuan Slope. He moved up the stream of the Chuan River, where he met the son of Pangeng, who lived at Mt. Fang. His (Pangeng's son's) daughter was named Ancestress Zhui. She was the utmost beauty, outshining everybody within the four quarters. Jilian heard of her betrothal and pursued her, reaching her at the waterside. There she gave birth to the elder son Cheng and the second-born Yuan. \u5b63\u9023\u521d\u964d\u4e8e\u9a29\u5c71\uff0c\u62b5\u4e8e\u7a74\u7aae\u3002\u524d\u51fa\u4e8e\u9a55\u5c71\uff0c\u5b85\u8655\u7230\u6ce2\uff08\u5761\uff09\u3002\u9006\u4e0a\u6c4c\u6c34\uff0c\u898b\u76e4\u5e9a\u4e4b\u5b50\uff0c\u8655\u65bc\u65b9\u5c71\u3002\u5973\u66f0\u6bd4\u96b9\uff0c\u79c9\u8332\u7387\u3010\u4e00\u3011\u76f8\uff0c\u8a48 \uff08\u80c4\uff09\u56db\u65b9\u3002\u5b63\u9023\u805e\u5176\u6709\u8058\uff0c\u5f9e\uff0c\u53ca\u4e4b\u76e4\uff0c\u7230\u751f \u4f2f\u3001\u9060\u4ef2\u3002\u3010\u4e8c\u3011Footnote 44 Limitations of space prevent me from adequately dealing with the rich geographical and mythological information in this section; I shall focus on its political aspects only. Jilian\u2014whose \u201cdescending\u201d (jiang \u964d) apparently implies divine birthFootnote 45 \u2014is considered the forefather of the Mi \u7f8b clan, i.e. the royal clan of Chu. Normally he is not identified as the earliest of Chu ancestors. According to the \u201cHereditary house of Chu\u201d chapter in the Records of the Historian, Jilian was preceded by several primordial ancestors, most notably the primeval Thearch Zhuanxu \u9853\u980a and the Rectifier of Fire (huozheng \u706b\u6b63) Zhurong \u795d\u878d.Footnote 46 Chu sacrificial materials from Tomb 2, Baoshan, Jingmen \u834a\u9580\u5305\u5c71 (Hubei), from Tomb 1, Wangshan, Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675\u671b\u5c71 (Hubei), and from Tomb 1 at Geling, Xincai \u65b0\u8521\u845b\u9675 (Henan), all record sacrifices to Zhurong and to his ancestor Laotong \u8001\u50ee, who were apparently considered more worthy of sacrifice than Jilian.Footnote 47 Yet these primeval ancestors are not mentioned at all in Chu ju. Instead the focus is on Jilian and on his relations with the son of the Shang \u5546 king, Pangeng \u76e4\u5e9a, whose daughter Jilian married.Footnote 48 This emphasis on the relations with the Shang ruling lineage suggests that the Shang connection was highly important for the narrators. Evidently, marrying Pangeng's granddaughter was a source of pride for the ancestor of the Chu ruling house, possibly an important asset for bolstering the house's legitimacy and prestige.Footnote 49 The emphasis on Jilian at the expense of his illustrious ancestors and some of his meritorious descendants is significant in the context of my discussion. It shows surprising modesty of the Chu historians who composed the Chu ju. To demonstrate the degree of this modesty it may be useful to compare Chu ju with a rarely noticed piece of pro-Chu propaganda in a transmitted text, namely the Zheng section of the Discourses of the States. The \u201cZheng yu\u201d \u912d\u8a9e narrates an advice given by the Zhou Scribe Bo \u53f2\u4f2f to Lord Huan of Zheng \u912d\u6853\u516c (r. 806\u2013770 BCE) on the eve of the collapse of the Western Zhou. The dating of the text is debatable, but it is likely that it is anterior to Chu ju.Footnote 50 One of the most interesting parts of this text is the section in which Scribe Bo predicts the unstoppable rise of Chu. According to his analysis, Chu's good fortunes derive from the merits of its leaders, past and present: Viscount Xiong Yan of Jing [= Chu] had four sons: [the elder] Boshuang, [the second] Zhongxue, [the third] Shuxiong, and [the youngest] Jixun.Footnote 51 Shuxiong avoided troubles by fleeing to Pu, where he became a savage; hence Jixun was established.Footnote 52 The Wei lineage planned to establish [Shuxiong] but failed to overcome troubles. This means that Heaven opened the path for him [Jixun].Footnote 53 Moreover, he is perspicacious and clear minded, harmonious and amicable; [his merits] exceed those of the former kings. I have heard: one for whom Heaven opens the path cannot be replaced for ten generations. His descendants will surely greatly expand their territory: they cannot be pressed. Besides, he is the descendant of Chong and Li. Li was the Rectifier of Fire under Gaoxin.Footnote 54 He was brilliant and resplendent; bright like Heaven and virtuous like Earth; he broadly illuminated all within the four seas; hence he was named Zhurong. His merits were great\u2026 The resurrection of [Zhu] Rong's descendants: will it start with the Mi clan?Footnote 55 Among the Mi, Kui and Yue do not deserve the Mandate; Mi of the Min are savages; only Jing [Chu] really possess brilliant virtue.Footnote 56 If Zhou declines, [Chu] will surely prosper. \u592b\u834a\u5b50\u718a\u56b4\u751f\u5b50\u56db\u4eba\uff1a\u4f2f\u971c\u3001\u4ef2\u96ea\u3001\u53d4\u718a\u3001\u5b63\u7d03\u3002\u53d4\u718a\u9003\u96e3\u4e8e\u6fee\u800c\u883b\uff0c\u5b63\u7d03\u662f\u7acb\uff0c\u85b3\u6c0f\u5c07\u8d77\u4e4b\uff0c\u798d\u53c8\u4e0d\u514b\u3002\u662f\u5929\u5553\u4e4b{\u5fc3Footnote 57 }\u4e5f\u3002\u53c8\u751a\u8070\u660e\u548c\u5354\uff0c\u84cb\u5176\u5148\u738b\u3002\u81e3\u805e\u4e4b\uff0c\u5929\u4e4b\u6240\u5553\uff0c\u5341\u4e16\u4e0d\u66ff\u3002\u592b\u5176\u5b50\u5b6b\u5fc5\u5149\u5553\u571f\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u506a\u4e5f\u3002\u4e14\u91cd\u3001\u9ece\u4e4b\u5f8c\u4e5f\uff0c\u592b\u9ece\u70ba\u9ad8\u8f9b\u6c0f\u706b\u6b63\uff0c\u4ee5\u6df3\u8000\u6566\u5927\uff0c\u5929\u660e\u5730\u5fb7\uff0c\u5149\u7167\u56db\u6d77\uff0c\u6545\u547d\u4e4b\u66f0\u300c\u795d\u878d\u300d\uff0c\u5176\u529f\u5927\u77e3\u3002\u22ef\u22ef\u878d\u4e4b\u8208\u8005\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u7f8b\u59d3\u4e4e\uff1f\u7f8b\u59d3\u5914\u8d8a\u4e0d\u8db3\u547d\u4e5f\u3002\u95a9\u7f8b\u883b\u77e3\uff0c\u552f\u834a\u5be6\u6709\u662d\u5fb7\uff0c\u82e5\u5468\u8870\uff0c\u5176\u5fc5\u8208\u77e3\u3002.Footnote 58 This passage\u2014which is exceptional in its pro-Chu attitudes among all the texts of the Warring States period\u2014provides two justifications for the anticipated rise of Chu: good qualities of its contemporaneous ruler, Jixun \u5b63\u7d03 (fl. ca.770 BCE), and the merits of Chu's mythical ancestor, Zhurong. Surely this line of argumentation in bolstering Chu's prestige was known to Chu statesmen and historians of the early Warring States period (which is the approximate time of Chu ju compilation).Footnote 59 That they opted to ignore it and to emphasize instead relations of the Mi clan to the Shang king Pangeng cannot be accidental. For whatever reasons, the composers of Chu ju may have considered intermarriage with the Shang royal clan as a more significant factor in supporting the Chu royalty than deeds of meritorious ancestors. Once again, a Chu historical text appears much less concerned with pro-Chu propaganda than could have been expected.\n\nXINIAN Xinian \u7e6b\u5e74 is another bamboo manuscript from the collection of Qinghua University. It is the lengthiest and most detailed historical text unearthed in recent decades. The text is divided into 23 sections that narrate major events from the history of the state of Chu, its rivals, and its allies from the beginning of the Western Zhou period to the early fourth century BCE. As I have discussed its structure, its dating, its potential audience, and the question of its authenticity elsewhere,Footnote 60 I shall focus here on the following topics: the text's relation to the state of Chu, its relevance to our search for traits of separate Chu identity, and the relation between its narration of Chu history and that in Zuo zhuan. Xinian is a composite text that incorporates materials from several Zhou polities; judging from the chronology it applies, these are the Western Zhou royal domain, and the states of Jin and Chu from the Eastern Zhou period. Yet despite the heterogeneity of the source materials, there are clear indications that Xinian was composed and probably edited in the state of Chu. First, each section of the text, except for the first, which narrates exclusively Western Zhou affairs, deals with the state of Chu either directly or through discussing its primary rivals or allies, such as the state of Jin. Second, the geographical perspective of Xinian is obviously biased toward the western part of the Zhou world. For instance, the state of Qin\u2014an important ally of Chu during much of the period under discussion\u2014is covered much more expansively than in other contemporaneous texts,Footnote 61 while eastern states, such as Qi and Lu which played a lesser role in Chu history, are less prominent; thus, the exploits of Lord Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685\u2013643 BCE), which occupy pride of place in Zuo zhuan, are given only marginal attention. Third, the Chu affiliation becomes more pronounced in the last sections of the text, which\u2014uncharacteristically for the rest of Xinian\u2014adopt the Chu chronology even when the narrative deals with Jin. Fourth, there are ritual indications of the text's respect toward the Chu kings: their deaths are invariably recorded as solemnly \u201cpassing away\u201d (jishi \u5373\u4e16), while this courtesy is not uniformly observed with regard to other regional lords.Footnote 62 All this suggests that the text was produced in Chu, although it clearly incorporated non-Chu materials. In marked distinction from Chu ju that focuses on internal history of Chu (or, more precisely, on a single aspect of it, namely the location of royal capitals and palaces), Xinian is preoccupied with Chu's foreign relations. Domestic affairs of Chu are rarely mentioned, and major instances of internal turmoil, such as the coups that first catapulted King Ling into power and then caused his fall, are glossed over. This concealment reminds one of the Springs-and-Autumns Annals, which never report directly about major domestic troubles in the state of Lu.Footnote 63 Yet Xinian does not conceal cases of Chu's military defeats, nor even tries to soften their impact. Let us look at section 21, which deals with the late fifth-century BCE struggle between Jin and Chu: At the seventh year of King Jianda of Chu [i.e., King Jian, r. ca. 431\u2013405 BCE], Lord Dao of Song attended the court audience in Chu, reporting that Pi, Minister of Public Works, acts to weaken the lord's house. The king ordered mo'ao Yang Wei to lead an army to stabilize the lord's house [of Song]. [This army] walled Huangchi and walled Yongqiu.Footnote 64 The Jin [leaders] Wei Si, Zhao Wan, and Han Qizhang led an army laying a siege on Huangchi; they assaulted it and then returned it to Chu.Footnote 65 After two years, the king ordered mo'ao Yang Wei to lead an army to invade Jin. He seized Yiyang and laid a siege to Chiyan so as to retaliate for the Huangchi campaign.Footnote 66 The Jin [leaders] Wei Si, Zhao Wan, and Han Qizhang led an army to assist Chiyan. The Chu army gave up the siege and retreated, and it fought the Jin army near the Long Wall.Footnote 67 The Chu army achieved nothing. They threw away their banners and tents and fled by night. Therefore Chu harbored strong resentment against Jin. \u695a\u7c21\u5927\u738b\u7acb\u4e03\u5e74\uff0c\u5b8b\u60bc\u516c\u671d\u4e8e\u695a\uff0c\u544a\u4ee5\u5b8b\u53f8\u57ce \u4e4b\u7d04\uff08\u5f31\uff1f\uff09\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\u738b\u547d\u83ab\u6556\u967d\u7232\u7387 \u3010114\u3011\u5e2b\u4ee5\u5b9a\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u57ce\u9ec3\u6c60\uff0c\u57ce\u96cd\u4e18\u3002\u6649\u9b4f\u65af\u3001\u8d99\u6d63\u3001\u97d3\u5553\u7ae0\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u9ec3\u6c60\uff0c \u8ff5\u800c\u6b78\u4e4b\u3010115\u3011\u65bc\u695a\u3002\u4e8c\u5e74\uff0c\u738b\u547d\u83ab\u6556\u967d\u7232\u7387\u5e2b\u4fb5\u6649\uff0c\u62d5\uff08\u596a\uff09\u5b9c\u967d\uff0c\u570d\u8d64\u5cb8\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fa9\u9ec3\u6c60\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u9b4f\u65af\u3001\u8d99\u6d63\u3001\u97d3\u5553\u3010116\u3011\u7ae0\u7387\u5e2b\u6551\u8d64\u5cb8\uff0c\u695a\u4eba\u820d\u570d\u800c\u9084\uff0c\u8207\u6649\u5e2b\u6230\u65bc\u9577\u57ce\u3002\u695a\u5e2b\u7121\u529f\uff0c\u591a\u68c4\u65c3\u5e55\uff0c\u5bb5\u9041\u3002\u695a\u4ee5\u3010117\u3011\u8207\u6649\u56fa\u7232\u6028\u3002\u3010118\u3011Footnote 68 The story of a continuous tit-for-tat struggle between Jin and Chu is depicted in such a neutral fashion that save from the Chu chronology nothing indicates its Chu origin. The text narrates in detail the humiliating defeat of the Chu armies: first, they abandoned the siege of Jin's Chiyan, retreating to Chu's Long Wall at Fangcheng \u65b9\u57ce; then they were battered there, throwing away \u201cbanners and tents\u201d and fleeing by night. The text which does it best to conceal domestic troubles at Chu, narrates quite candidly how ingloriously its armies fought. This candor becomes even more pronounced in the last section, which depicts a series of Chu-Jin campaigns ca. 400\u2013396 BCE. That section ends with the following passage: After two years (396 BCE?),Footnote 69 Han Qu and Wei Ji led an army and laid siege to Wuyang, to repay the incursion of Gao (of 398 BCE).Footnote 70 The Lord of Luyang led an army to help Wuyang, and fought the Jin army below the Wuyang walls. The Chu army was greatly defeated. Three lords-possessors of the gui tablet, the Duke of Luyang, Duke Daowu of Pingye, and Duke Huanding of Yangcheng, as well as youyin Si of Zhao (Zhao Si), died in that battle;Footnote 71 the Chu forces threw away their banners, tents, chariots and weapons, and returned, running like fleeing dogs. The Chen people thereupon rebelled and let Prince Ding back into Chen.Footnote 72 Thus the state of Chu lost a lot of walled cities. \u53ad\uff08\u85a6\uff1f\uff09\u5e74\uff0c\u97d3\u3010133\u3011\u53d6\u3001\u9b4f\u64ca\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u6b66\u967d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fa9\u90dc\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u9b6f\u967d\u516c\u7387\u5e2b\u6551\u6b66\u967d\uff0c\u8207\u6649\u5e2b\u6230\u65bc\u6b66\u967d\u4e4b\u57ce\u3010134\u3011\u4e0b\uff0c\u695a\u5e2b\u5927\u6557\uff0c\u9b6f\u967d\u516c\u3001\u5e73\u591c\u60bc\u6b66\u541b\u3001\u967d\u57ce\u6853\u5b9a\u541b\uff0c\u4e09\u57f7\u73ea\u4e4b\u541b\u8207\u53f3\u5c39\u662d\u4e4b\u7ae2\u6b7b\u7109\uff0c\u695a\u4eba\u76e1\u68c4\u5176\u3010135\u3011\u65c3\u5e55\u8eca\u5175\uff0c\u72ac\u9038\u800c\u9084\u3002\u9673\u4eba\u7109\u53cd\u800c\u5165\u738b\u5b50\u5b9a\u65bc\u9673\u3002\u695a\u90a6\u4ee5\u591a\u4ea1\u57ce\u3002Footnote 73 Putting precise details of these campaigns aside we can immediately notice the highly unflattering depiction of Chu military performance in the text. The text not only frankly admits the magnitude of Chu's defeat but even buttresses it through a humiliating comparison of Chu's fleeing armies to running dogs. Clearly, the idea of strengthening the Chu identity and its pride in a or its glorious past was not the concern of Xinian composers. Two above examples suffice to show how candid the Xinian authors are in depicting Chu's military defeats. Nor do they hail the victories too much. The beginning of Chu's territorial expansion is briefly mentioned in sections 2 and 5, but it is not eulogized nor is it connected to any merits of Chu kings. Rather it is presented as coincidental: favorable inter-state circumstances allowed Chu to advance into the Han \u6f22 River valley and beyond. Great victories of Chu under King Zhuang, the singularly successful Chu leader, are noticed but do not merit detailed discussion. Oddly, King Zhuang's exploits are highlighted in Xinian much less than in Zuo zhuan. Nor does the text single out any other Chu leader for exceptional praise. That Xinian is not concerned with Chu's local pride does not require further illustrations. Yet its discovery may allow us to pose another question: How does its presentation of Zhou history differ from that in transmitted sources, especially Zuo zhuan? Since the bulk of Xinian (sections 4\u201319) largely parallels the Zuo zhuan narrative, this allows a meaningful comparison between the two. Elsewhere I have undertaken this comparison and have demonstrated the considerable similarities between the two narratives.Footnote 74 The two texts do differ with regard to certain details, but generally the differences are minor. In a few cases, however, different narration of the same chain of events in Xinian may reflect its authors\u2019 pro-Chu stance. For our discussion the most interesting case is section 16 of Xinian, which differs from Zuo zhuan in a few important details. Let us focus on its account: In the seventh year of King Gong of Chu (r. 590\u2013560 BCE, i.e. in 584 BCE), Prime Minister Zizhong invaded Zheng, initiating the Fan campaign.Footnote 75 Lord Jing of Jin (r. 599\u2013581 BCE) assembled the regional lords to rescue Zheng. The people of Zheng captured [a Chu officer,] Yi, the lord of Yun, and presented him to Lord Jing. Lord Jing returned [to Jin] taking [Yi] with him. [After?] one year (582 BCE?),Footnote 76 Lord Jing wanted to establish amicable relations with Chu; hence, he released the Lord of Yun, and let him go back and seek peace. King Gong of Chu dispatched the Lord of Yun for an official visit to Jin and approved the peace. Lord Jing dispatched Fa of Ji (Ji Fa) for an official visit to Chu, renewing the peace. Before [Ji Fa] returned, [Lord Jing of Jin] died, and Lord Li (r. 580\u2013574 BCE) was established. King Gong dispatched Royal Scion Chen for an official visit to Jin and also renewed the peace. The king also sent the Song Commander-of-the-Right, Huasun Yuan [Hua Yuan] to arrange peaceful relations between Jin and Chu. The next year (579 BCE), Royal Scion Ba of Chu met Wenzi Xie (i.e., Shi Xie \u58eb\u71ee, a.k.a. Shi Wenzi \u58eb\u6587\u5b50) of Jin and nobles of regional lords, and made a covenant at Song, saying: \u201cPut to rest armor and weapons of All-under-Heaven.\u201d The next year (578 BCE), Lord Li [of Jin] was the first to raise an army and lead the regional lords to invade Qin, reaching the Jing River. King Gong also led an army, laying siege at Zheng. Lord Li came to rescue Zheng and defeated the Chu army at Yan.Footnote 77 Lord Li also encountered misfortune, and died leaving no posterity.Footnote 78 \u695a\u5171\u738b\u7acb\u4e03\u5e74\uff0c\u4ee4\u5c39\u5b50\u91cd\u4f10\u912d\uff0c\u7232\uff1f\uff08\u6c3e\uff1f\uff09\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u6649\u666f\u516c\u6703\u8af8\u4faf\u4ee5\u6551\u912d\uff0c\u912d\u4eba\u6b62\u9116\u516c\u5100\uff0c\u737b\u301085\u3011\u8af8\u666f\u516c\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u4ee5\u6b78\u3002\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u6b32\u8207\u695a\u4eba\u7232\u597d\uff0c\u4e43\u812b\u9116\u516c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b78\u6c42\u6210\uff0c\u5171\u738b\u4f7f\u9116\u516c\u8058\u65bc\u301086\u3011\u6649\uff0c\u4e14\u8a31\u6210\u3002\u666f\u516c\u4f7f\u7cf4\u4e4b\u8337\u8058\u65bc\u695a\uff0c\u4e14\u4fee\u6210\uff0c\u672a\u9084\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u5352\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u5373\u4f4d\u3002\u5171\u738b\u4f7f\u738b\u301087\u3011\u5b50\u8fb0\u8058\u65bc\u6649\uff0c\u53c8\u4fee\u6210\uff0c\u738b\u53c8\u4f7f\u5b8b\u53f3\u5e2b\u83ef\u5b6b\u5143\u884c\u6649\u695a\u4e4b\u6210\u3002\u660e\u6b72\uff0c\u695a\u738b\u5b50\u7f77\u6703\u6649\u6587\u301088\u3011\u5b50\u71ee\u53ca\u8af8\u4faf\u4e4b\u5927\u592b\uff0c\u76df\u65bc\u5b8b\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u723e\uff08\u5f2d\uff09\u5929\u4e0b\u4e4b\u7532\u5175\u3002\u201d \u660e\u6b72\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u5148\u8d77\u5175\uff0c\u7387\u5e2b\u6703\u8af8\u4faf\u4ee5\u4f10\u301089\u3011\u79e6\uff0c\u81f3\u4e8e\u6d87\u3002\u5171\u738b\u4ea6\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u912d\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u6551\u912d\uff0c\u6557\u695a\u5e2b\u65bc\u9122\u3002\u53b2\u516c\u4ea6\u898b\u798d\u4ee5\u6b7b\uff0c\u4ea1\uff08\u7121\uff09\u5f8c\u3002\u301090\u3011Footnote 79 This narrative focuses on the first attempt to establish a lasting peace between Chu and Jin\u2014the peace conference in the state of Song in 579 BCE\u2014and the rapid breakup of amicable relations between the two parties thereafter. I shall not focus here on the very minor discrepancies between the Xinian and Zuo zhuan narratives. What matters for me is the core of the story: Who was responsible for the breakup of the first attempt to reconcile two rival powers? The events depicted in Xinian are narrated in great detail in Zuo zhuan, and the two sources agree on the basic facts. What differs, though, is the nature of the peace conference in 579 BCE, and the reasons for its failure. In Zuo zhuan, the conference was attended by just two parties, Jin and Chu; and the covenant (the content of which is cited) focused on establishing amicable relations between the two parties only. In Xinian, in distinction, the meeting was attended also by the \u201cnobles of regional lords\u201d (i.e., was multilateral), and the covenant's goal was attaining peace in \u201cAll-under-Heaven,\u201d similar to the later multilateral peace conferences of 546 BCE and 541 BCE.Footnote 80 On this point, Zuo zhuan appears more reliable: should a 579 BCE peace conference have been attended by more parties, it is likely that this would be reflected in the Springs-and-Autumns Annals as well, which is not the case. It is more plausible that the Xinian authors (or the authors of their source) conflated the agreements of 546 BCE and 541 BCE with that of 579 BCE. What happened after the agreement? Zuo zhuan insists that Chu was perfidious: soon after the covenant was sealed, the Chu lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39 (Prime Minister) warned his visiting Jin colleague that the two rulers, if they ever met, would only exchange arrows and not ceremonial greetings.Footnote 81 The subsequent Jin assault on Qin in 578 BCE is presented as unrelated to the Jin-Chu peace agreement and as fully justifiable in light of Qin's anti-Jin machinations. It is Chu's attack on Zheng in 576 BCE that violates the covenant with Jin; Zuo zhuan repeatedly cites pronouncements of Chu and Jin dignitaries, who blame the Chu leadership for violating the peace and leading to the disastrous (for Chu) battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 in 575 BCE. Only at the depiction of the battle itself does the Zuo zhuan narration shift toward a more critical stance toward Jin: its success is presented as a Pyrrhic victory, leading soon to domestic turmoil. Xinian\u2019s interpretation of these events differs radically. The Jin assault against Qin is viewed as a violation of an agreement to establish \u201cuniversal\u201d peace; Chu's assault on Zheng appears as a retaliatory measure. Moreover, the Xinian authors are manipulative in their account: by dispelling with precise chronology after 578 BCE, they present all the events that spanned five years (Chu's attack on Zheng, Jin's retaliation, the Yanling battle, and the coup against Lord Li of Jin) as happening immediately one after another in the direct aftermath of Jin's anti-Qin aggression. The blame for the collapse of peace is placed squarely on Lord Li of Jin, whose violent death a year after the Yanling battle may be seen as divine retaliation for his perfidy. Chu was the victim; and while it was defeated militarily, the perpetrator, Lord Li, was punished by a humiliating death. There is no doubt that we have here two radically different interpretations of the same chain of events: the predominantly pro-Jin narrative of Zuo zhuan versus the unequivocally pro-Chu version of Xinian. Yet we should notice immediately that in terms of facts both narratives do not differ substantially (except for the precise content of the 579 covenant). And while each of the accounts is manipulative, neither appears to abandon the basic factual framework. This supports my earlier observation that the historical accounts of both Xinian and Zuo zhuan are fundamentally reliable\u2014minor embellishments, mistakes, and manipulations notwithstanding.Footnote 82 For the current discussion, suffice it to notice that while there are traits of pro-Chu sentiments in Xinian, in general this text contributes very little\u2014if at all\u2014to strengthening the Chu identity. Much like the anecdotes and Chu ju, Xinian remains overwhelmingly neutral in its depiction of Chu's past.\n\nRONGCHENGSHI The final text that I want to consider here is Rongchengshi \u5bb9\u6210\u6c0f, from the collection of Shanghai Museum. This relatively lengthy text of slightly over 2,000 characters presents the history of the Chinese world from the time of legendary thearchs down to the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The goal of this presentation is not purely historical: the narrative is built so as to convince the reader of the advantages of non-hereditary power transfer (ideally through the ruler's abdication in favor of a worthier candidate). Since the text had been translated and discussed twice,Footnote 83 I shall not address its complexity here but focus only on its Chu-related aspects. The Chu affiliation of Rongchengshi is not self-evident. While the manuscript was produced by a Chu scribe using Chu orthography, and was in all likelihood interred in the tomb of a Chu elite member, almost nothing in its content relates it to Chu. The only possible Chu trait is in the final phrase of the narrative about the creation of the Nine Provinces by Thearch Yu \u79b9 in the aftermath of the great flood. The narrative itself has no observable Chu connection, and the map of the Nine Provinces in Rongchengshi is markedly shifted to the north in comparison with its variants scattered through other texts, leaving Chu on the southern margins of the habitable world.Footnote 84 Yet the ending lines say: \u201cYu then created five hundred famous valleys to the south of the Han River and five hundred famous valleys to the north of the Han River\u201d.Footnote 85 This centrality of the Han River strongly suggests a Chu affiliation of the text's authors. However, as noted by Vera Dorofeeva-Lichtmann, it is also possible that the line was added by a Chu transmitter who wanted to make the text\u2014originally produced elsewhere\u2014more relevant to Chu.Footnote 86 Aside from this single line, no other aspect of Rongchengshi connects it with the state of Chu. I remain undecided regarding the origin of Rongchengshi: perhaps we should not consider it at all as a product of Chu historiography. However, insofar as the manuscript was looted from a Chu tomb, and insofar as it can be assumed that the text circulated in the state of Chu (and might have enjoyed sufficient prestige to merit interment in a tomb) it is justifiable to consider it in the framework of the present discussion. Two points should be raised here. First is the marked absence of identifiable Chu royal ancestors\u2014such as Zhuanxu, Zhurong, and the like\u2014from the lengthy list of legendary heroes discussed in the text. Second, the Rongchengshi narrative is markedly \u201ccenter-oriented,\u201d as it focuses exclusively on the monarchs who ruled the entire subcelestial realm. Regional lords, be they the kings of Chu or leaders of other polities, are simply ignored. The norm, as the authors repeatedly emphasize, is universal rule, attaining which represents the apex of the monarch's achievements. Thus, the text hails a primordial thearch whose reign preceded that of Thearch Yao \u582f: Superiors and inferiors, noble and mean\u2014each attained their [predestined] years. [The people] from beyond the four seas arrived as guests, and those from within the four seas were corrected. Birds and beasts came to court; fish and turtles submitted [tribute]; there was [smooth] communication between [localities with] abundant and deficient [resources]. \u4e0a\u4e0b\u8cb4\u8ce4\uff0c\u5404\u5f97\u5176\u4e16\u3002\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5916\u8cd3\uff0c\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5167\u8c9e\u3002\u79bd\u7378\u671d\uff0c\u9b5a\u9f08\u737b\uff0c\u6709\u7121\u901a\u3002Footnote 87 Elsewhere, the text hails the rule of Thearch Yu: He understood the distant from [inspecting] the near, eradicated quibbling and pursued simplicity; he relied on the people's desires, brought together the beneficent [matters of] Heaven and Earth, so that the near rejoiced in the orderly rule while the distant came on their own initiative. Everybody within and outside the four seas requested to submit tribute. \u4e43\u56e0\u8fe9\u4ee5\u77e5\u9060\uff0c\u53bb\u82db\u800c\u884c\u7c21\uff0c\u56e0\u6c11\u4e4b\u6b32\uff0c\u6703\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u5229\uff0c\u592b\u662f\u4ee5\u8fd1\u8005\u6085\u6cbb\uff0c\u800c\u9060\u8005\u81ea\u81f3\u3002\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5167\u53ca\uff0c\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5916\u7686\u8acb\u8ca2\u3002Footnote 88 Both passages emphasize the universality of the thearch's rule. In the first case the encompassing power of an unnamed thearch transcends the boundaries of humankind, reaching down to birds, beasts, fish, and turtles: all those strive to become the thearch's subjects.Footnote 89 In the second case unity remains confined to the realm of humans, but it is still comprehensive: all those from \u201cwithin and outside the four seas\u201d duly request to submit tribute. In both cases the entire subcelestial realm\u2014\u201cnear\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d alike\u2014remains under the unified control. Regional polities appear in the text only when we enter the calamitous age of the last Shang tyrant, Zhouxin \u7d02\u8f9b (d. ca. 1046 BCE). Then, rebellions by regional lords and the danger of political disintegration appear as important symptoms of the overall deterioration that eventually justified the overthrow of the Shang. The Rongchengshi insistence that a politically unified world is the only normative situation may explain why Chu remains outside the narrative. In the unified universal realm independent or semi-independent regional lords (such as the king of Chu) are just an aberration. Accordingly, the multi-state system that stands at the center of Xinian and which was the norm for centuries prior to the composition of Rongchengshi is glossed over altogether. Under the rule of sage kings, regional states play no role, nor is there any meaning for regional identities. In the political vision of Rongchengshi there is simply no place for the state of Chu."}, {"url": "http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/zhou-event-chunqiu.html", "page_content": "Oct 3, 2018 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nThe Spring and Autumn period (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb, 770-5th cent. BCE) is the first part of the so-called Eastern Zhou period (Dongzhou \u6771\u5468, 770-221 BCE). It is characterized by a significant decrease of political power of the kings of Zhou which had to flee to the eastern capital Chengzhou \u6210\u5468 (or Luoyi \u96d2\u9091, modern Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d, Henan) after their western and main capital Zongzhou \u5b97\u5468 (of Feng \u8c50, near modern Xi'an \u897f\u5b89, Shaanxi) had been attacked by the nomad tribes of the Quanrong \u72ac\u620e.\n\nPeriodization\n\nThe name of the historical period is derived from the chronicle of the regional state of Lu \u9b6f called Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" because the seasons are always mentioned in the entries. The Annals cover the time from 722 to 481 BCE, yet the historical period is traditionally counted from the reign of King Ping of Zhou \u5468\u5e73\u738b (r. 770-720 BCE), who restored the Zhou dynasty in Luoyang, down to the division of the state of Jin \u6649 by the regional rulers (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) of Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f and Zhao \u8d99 in 376. Alternatively, the end of the Spring and Autumn period can be seen as 453, when the three viscounts (zi \u5b50) of Han, Wei and Zhao extinguished all other lateral lines to the house of Jin, or 403, when King Weilie of Zhou \u5468\u5a01\u70c8\u738b (r. 426-402) bestowed upon the viscounts of Han, Wei and Zhao the title of marquis (hou \u4faf).\n\nThe second great historiographical writing of the Spring and Autumn period is the collection Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e \"Discourses of the states\" that includes anecdotes of the states of Zhou \u5468, Lu \u9b6f, Qi \u9f4a, Jin \u6649, Zheng \u912d, Chu \u695a, Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a. Said to be a composition of Zuo Qiuming \u5de6\u4e18\u660e, its oldest parts must have been compiled at the end of the 5th century BCE.\n\nConfucius\n\nThe most important intellectual person of this historical period was the philosopher Confucius (Kongzi \u5b54\u5b50; ca. 551-479) who tried to revive the ideal of the human and righteous rulers of old. Although his ideas seemed lost in a time of political realism his thoughts about state and society (\"Confucianism\") were to become the fundamental doctrine of imperial China.\n\nThe Early Decades of the Eastern Zhou and the Duke of Zheng\n\nThe eastern capital Chengzhou (Luoyang) did not provide the kings of Zhou with sufficient power. They were therefore dependent on the powerful regional rulers, especially those of Qin \u79e6, Jin, Qi and Chu. These are called the \"local rulers\" (fang bo \u65b9\u4f2f) because they practically ruled independently from the king of Zhou, and not any more as his vassals. It became common that the regional states acted on their own behalf regarding territory and military feuds, without asking the king of Zhou for formal permission. Duke Zhuang of Zheng \u912d\u838a\u516c (r. 743-701) even dared attacking King Huan \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 720-697 BCE) who had not treated him properly according to the ritual regulations. Heijian \u9ed1\u80a9, the Duke of Zhou \u5468\u516c, even planned to kill King Huan's successor, King Zhuang \u5468\u838a\u738b (r. 697-682), and to replace him with Prince Ke \u514b. Yet Xin Bo \u8f9b\u4f2f warned the king and saved his life.\n\nDuke Zhuang of Zheng defeated intruding Rong \u620e tribes and swallowed the neighbouring state of Xu \u8a31. In 707 King Huan of Zhou \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 719-697) started a punitive expedition against the Duke, but the king was defeated. From then on, the kings of Zhou never again tried to intervene into the politics of their own regional rulers. They stayed in their small royal domain around Luoyang and had to be content with the tributes of the regional rulers that were presented less and less regularly. Besides Zheng, the states of Song \u5b8b and Lu \u9b6f demonstrated their military and political power in the Central Plain.\n\nThe Rise of Duke Huan of Qi\n\nKing Li \u5468\u91d0\u738b (r. 682-677) was so helpless against the new threats endangering the empire that he allowed Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) to adopt the title of hegemonial lord (ba \u9738, or bo \u4f2f). In this function the Duke defended the regional states against raids of barbarian tribes and cared for law and order among the states of the Middle Kingdom, with the motto \"support the king and ward off the barbarians\" (zun wang rang yi \u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937).\n\nIn the east, the state of Qi had rich natural ressources and became one of the mightiest regional states of the Eastern Zhou period.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi employed the legalist statesman Guan Zhong \u7ba1\u4ef2 as his adviser who reorganized administration and the military and financial systems. Through these reforms Qi was able to subdue Song and Lu and even the hegemonial state of Zheng. At that time, the non-Chinese nomad tribes of the Rong and Di \u72c4 undertook raids on the soil of Chinese states and devastated the states of Xing \u90a2 and Wei \u885b (modern Shanxi and Hebei). Duke Huan of Qi rescued the dynastic houses of these states and settled them down more to the south. The system of the hegemon thus developed to a kind of lord protector of a strong state over weaker ones, and Qi promised to protect the states in the Central Plain against further intrusions of the northern nomad warriors.\n\nThe Semi-Barbarian Kingdom of Chu\n\nIn the south, the state of Chu on the middle Yangtze River had become politically stronger than before. King Cheng of Chu \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 671-626) started to challenge the hegemony of Qi and swallowed smaller states in his neighbourhood. Nonetheless, subservient states like Jiang \u6c5f and Huang \u9ec3 changed side and declared their alliance with Qi. Chu thereupon attacked Zheng. Duke Huan assembled the regional rulers and created an alliance with Lu, Song, Chen and Wei to punish Chu in 656 by devastating the state of Cai \u8521, an ally of Chu. Chu gave in, and the ambassadors of the two mighty states met at Shaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan) to conclude a peaceful alliance (meng \u76df).\n\nThe System of Hegemonial Lordship\n\nIn 651 Qi organized a meeting at Kuiqiu \u8475\u4e18 (modern Lankao \u862d\u8003, Henan) whith the representatives of Lu, Song, Zheng and Wei, and in presence of a royal diplomat from Zhou. The members of the meeting decided that states creating a friendly alliance should never attack each other, and that they had to assist each other in case that one partner was attacked. The Duke of Qi thus became the overlord over the weaker states of Zhou China and replaced the king of Zhou as the highest judicial person.\n\nSuccession Crises at the Zhou Court\n\nWhen King Li died a succession crisis endangered the house of Zhou. His righteous heir was Prince Kan \u95ac, who is known as King Hui \u5468\u60e0\u738b (r. 677-652), but his late grandfather, King Zhuang, had had a favourite son called Prince Tui \u7a68. King Hui was not a very intelligent ruler. He offended many of his highest ministers and caused a rebellion that forced him to flee to Wen \u6eab (modern Wenxian \u6eab\u7e23, Henan) and then to Li \u6adf, a town in the state of Zheng. His uncle Prince Tui was made King of Zhou, but he did not prove a better ruler. He was therefore attacked and killed by the lords of Zheng and Guo \u8662. King Hui returned to the throne.\n\nWhen King Hui died he was succeeded by his son Prince Zheng \u912d, who is known as King Xiang \u5468\u8944\u738b (r. 652-619). King Xiang had a half-brother called Shudai \u53d4\u5e36 (or Dai \u5e36), who had been the favourite son of King Hui. Prince Shudai planned to usurp the throne and joined forces with the Rong and Di \u7fdf tribes. The plot failed and Prince Shudai fled to Qi. It was a high minister of Qi, the reformer Guan Zhong, who mediated the peace treaty between the house of Zhou and the Rong tribes. A decade later the king of Zhou even allowed Prince Shudai to return.\n\nWhen the state of Zheng attacked in 639 the statelet of Hua \u6ed1, whose lords were relatives to the house of Zhou, King Xiang sent You Sun \u6e38\u5b6b and Bo Fu \u4f2f\u670d as diplomats to negotiate peace. Yet the Duke of Zheng arrested the diplomats. The King thereupon ordered the Di tribes to attack Zheng, inspite of the remonstances of minister Fu Chen \u5bcc\u8fb0. Fu Chen was also not content with the King's will to marry a Di princess in order to reward the Di chieftain for his support. His critics were justified because only a few years later King Xiang discarded the \"barbarian\" queen, which caused an attack of the Di on the royal capital, during which the Earl of Tan \u8b5a (or the earls of Yuan \u539f and Mao \u6bdb) was/were killed. Fu Chen thereupon threw himself into battle against the intruders and died. King Xiang fled to Zheng and was received by the duke of Zheng, in spite of all former discrepancies.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Dai was enthroned as King of Zhou, yet he took residence in Wen, not in Luoyang. He invited the Di queen to return to the royal domain. Two years later King Xiang asked the duke of Jin for help, who willingly attacked the usurper and executed him. King Xiang, returning to the throne, rewarded Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628) with the title of hegemonial lord and presented him with some territory. Duke Wen was thereafter the most powerful political leader of the Middle Kingdom and assembled the regional rulers, including his formal superior, the King of Zhou, at Heyang \u6cb3\u967d and Jiantu \u8e10\u571f. The kings of Zhou were now wholly dependent from support by other political actors. Histories nevertheless concealed this shameful situation with terms like \"royal hunt at Heyang\".\n\nThe Rise of the Regional State of Jin\n\nAfter the death of Duke Huan of Qi several regional rulers strove for overlordship. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637) was defeated by Chu, and the state of Song lost its last chance to rise to political and military significance. Instead, the state of Jin rose to supremacy in old China: Duke Xian of Jin \u6649\u737b\u516c (r. 676-651) had already extended the power of his state by swallowing the statelets of Geng \u803f, Huo \u970d, Wei \u9b4f (a state that was later one of the three destructors of Jin), Guo \u8662 and Yu \u865e. After a decade of inner struggles, the state of Qin supported Duke Wen of Jin in his ascension to the throne of Jin.\n\nJust as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin employed political advisors, Zhao Shuai \u8d99\u8870 (Zhao Chengzi \u8d99\u6210\u5b50) and Hu Yan \u72d0\u5043, who strengthened the \"national\" economy and so the military power of the state. In 635 the King Xiang of Zhou escaped from inner disturbances to the state of Zheng. Duke Wen of Jin saw his chance, rescued the king and accompanied him back to the royal domain, for which support he was highly rewarded by the King.\n\nThe next step for the Duke was to challenge the power of the southern, semi-Chinese state of Chu that had dominated the Central Plain since the death of Duke Huan of Qi. In 632 the two states clashed at the battle of Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee (modern Zhencheng \u7504\u57ce, Shandong), and Chu was defeated. Duke Wen of Jin established a new friendly alliance during the meeting at Jiantu \u8e10\u571f (modern Yingze \u6ece\u6fa4, Henan) with the seven most important states. In the same year, at Wen, the King of Zhou sanctified the hegemony by Jin. Duke Wen's successor Duke Xiang \u6649\u8944\u516c (r. 627-621) was able to prolong the hegemonial prevalence of the state of Jin.\n\nConflict Between Qin and Jin\n\nDuring the reign of Duke Xiang of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin \u79e6\u7a46\u516c (r. 659-621) opened a long period of military confrontation between Jin and Qin, but Qin seldomly won any battle. The powerful state of Jin blocked the gate to the Central Plain, and Qin could not but expand its territory to the west into the territory of the Western Rong tribes \u897f\u620e and establish good relations with Chu in the south. Chu meanwhile further expanded its territory by conquering the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f, Lu \u516d (a special reading!), and Liao \u84fc. After the death of Duke Xiang of Jin, the noble Zhao Dun \u8d99\u76fe (Zhao Xuanzi \u8d99\u5ba3\u5b50) dominated the throne succession of Jin, murdered Duke Ling \u6649\u9748\u516c (r. 620-607) and enthroned Duke Cheng \u6649\u6210\u516c (r. 606-600). During this period Jin lost its initiative in \"foreign\" politics. The political advisor Fan Shan \u8303\u5c71 proposed to King Mu of Chu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614) to take the chance and to advance against the north.\n\nThe Rise of the State of Chu\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) had to resolve internal quarrels and uprisings of aboriginal tribes before he was able to reform economic and military administration and to resume this expansion politics. In 606 the southern king sent out an envoy to the court of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 606-586) to express his will to swallow the royal domain of Zhou. In 598 King Zhuang of Chu crushed the small state of Chen \u9673, one year later the state of Zheng. At the battle of Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan) the army of the hegemonial state of Jin was defeated.\n\nA few years later, Chu defeated the state of Song and finally obtained the overlordship over the Central Plain. The protecting task of the overlord had gradually lost its original intention and became a system of hegemony of one major state over weak satellites of Chinese and \"barbarian\" origin. The attitude to help small states during internal quarrels and against \"barbarian\" invaders changed to a regular intervention into political affairs to the advantage of the great states.\n\nInternal Quarrels in Jin\n\nThe state of Qi observed the growing power of Chu, declared a friendly relationship with the southern king of Chu, who was the only regional ruler who called himself king, except, of course, the King of Zhou. Qi repeatedly attacked the smaller states of Lu and Wei which therefore asked for support the former hegemonial state of Jin. In 589, the army of Jin fought with Qi in the battle of An \u978d (modern Jinan \u6fdf\u5357, Shandong) and once again demonstrated its superior military power. Chu instantly declared war to Jin, but neither Chu nor Jin dared to initiate a concrete campaign.\n\nAfter long years of hesitation and negotiations (under the stipulation of Jin's political advisor Song Huayuan \u5b8b\u83ef\u5143) Chu attacked Zheng and Wei in 576. One year later the armies of the two hegemonial states fought in the famous battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan) in which Jin prevailed by a narrow margin. Duke Li of Jin \u6649\u53b2\u516c (r. 580-573) saw his chance to resume hegemony, murdered his mightiest noblemen Xi Zhi \u90e4\u81f3, Xi Qi \u90e4\u9321 and Xi Chou \u90e4\u72a8 (the \"Three Xi\" \u4e09\u90e4). Yet instead of having strengthened his own position, Duke Li faced serious opposition by the Jin aristocracy like Luan Shu \u6b12\u66f8 and Xun Yan \u8340\u5043 who eventually killed their lord.\n\nUnder the next ruler, Duke Dao \u6649\u60bc\u516c (r. 572-558), the internal situation calmed down, and the duke was able to strengthen the position of the state of Jin. His political advisor Wei Jiang \u9b4f\u7d73 proposed to appease the nomad warriors of the Rong with financial tributes instead of fighting them. In 571 Jin erected a fortification wall at Hulao \u864e\u7262 (modern Fanshui \u6c3e\u6c34, Henan) against the state of Zheng that was backed by Chu.\n\nAfter more than two decades of relative peace the political advisor Song Xiangxu \u5b8b\u5411\u620c proposed to organize a peace conference to end military conflict. It was held in the capital of Jin in 546 and the participating fourteeen states decided to accept the overlordship of the two states of Jin and Chu. Their adherents had to declare their subjection under the respective overlordship and to present tributes to the two hegemons. Among the participating states, there would be ten years of peace, and for more than fourty years, Jin and Chu would not meet at the battle field again.\n\nOnly two of the larger states did not participate in the general peace: Qi, and Qin.\n\nThe old kingdom of Zhou had totally lost its political role. The tributes once paid to the kings of Zhou were now offered to the dukes of Jin and the kings of Chu. If a small state did not pay tribute it had to expect military sanctions. Especially precarious was the role of the state of Lu that had to maintain good relationships to the three states of Jin, Chu and Qi, if it did not want to be swallowed by one of them. Very similar was the role of Zheng that was directly in the line of fire between Jin and Chu. But states like Lu also imitated the overlordship of their own masters and demanded tributes from yet smaller states like Teng \u6ed5, Qi \u675e or Zeng \u912b.\n\nThe Rise of the Semi-Barbarian States of Wu and Yue\n\nDuring the relatively peaceful sixth century, the two southern non-Chinese coastal states of Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a emerged as new powers. Jin saw its chance to open a second flank against Chu, and in 583 Duke Wuchen of Shen \u7533\u516c\u5deb\u81e3 was sent to Wu in order to seek a military alliance. The semi-barbarian state of Wu was equipped with military tools and Wu soldiers were trained to attack Chu. But it was only more than half a century later that Wu became a serious threat to Chu after swallowing the statelet of Xu \u5f90.\n\nUnder King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad (r. 514-496) the political advisor Wu Yuan \u4f0d\u54e1 proposed to raise three armies that clockwise were to skirmish at the borders of Chu to weaken this state. In 506 the whole army of Wu finally attacked Chu and defeated this state at Baiju or Boju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). In pursuit of the escaping enemy, the army of Wu advanced to the capital of Chu, Yingdu \u90e2\u90fd (modern Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675, Hebei). King Zhao of Chu \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489) had to take his flight and sought for help in Qin. This western state sent out chariots that expelled the invaders from Wu.\n\nWu's neighbour Yue took the advantage of the prolonged campaigns against Chu to invade Wu. In 496, Wu set its troops into march to carry out a punitive expedition against Yue, but King Hel\u00fc died in the battle of Zuili \u6a87\u674e (modern Jiaxing \u5609\u8208, Zhejiang). Two years later, King Fucha \u592b\u5dee of Wu (r. 495-473) defeated Yue during the revenge battle of Fujiao \u592b\u6912 (modern Suzhou \u8607\u5dde, Jiangsu). Goujian \u53e5\u8e10, king of Yue (r. 496-465), fled to Mount Guiji \u6703\u7a3d\u5c71 (south of modern Shaoxing \u7d39\u8208, Zhejiang).\n\nAlthough Fucha's advisor Wu Yuan proposed to destroy the state of Yue, the king of Wu was content with his success in battle and the destruction of the capital of Yue. After the defeat of Chu and Yue, King Fucha turned his attention to the north. He had a fortification wall built at Han \u9097 (near modern Yangzhou \u63da\u5dde, Jiangsu) and dug out canals (see Grand Canal) that connected the Yangtze River with the Huai River \u6dee\u6c34 valley, creating a traffic line to the north and the possibility to move troops faster. The small states of Lu and Zhu \u90be declared themselves subjects to Wu. In the years 485 and 484 Wu attacked several times the state of Qi by land and by river and finally defeated Qi in the battle of Ailing \u827e\u9675 (modern Laiwu \u840a\u856a, Shandong). Wu assembled the states of the Central Plain to a meeting at Huangchi \u9ec3\u6c60 (modern Fengqiu \u5c01\u4e18, Henan), with the intention to declare its hegemony. Jin, weakened by internal struggles, did not dare to challenge the new powerful state of Wu, and King Fucha became the new hegemon.\n\nJust during the conference of Huangchi, King Goujian of Yue took the chance and invaded the capital of Wu. The overstretched military power of the state of Wu was unable to withstand the southern opponent who had rebuilt its strength after the defeat of Guiji. In 473, Yue destroyed the state of Wu and replaced it as the dominating power of the southeast. King Goujian of Yue was the last of the so-called Five Hegemons (Wuba \u4e94\u9738).\n\nThe Five Hegemons are also called the \"Five Earls\" (Wubo \u4e94\u4f2f). Different literary sources and commentaries identify them with different persons. The traditional definition by Zhao Qi \u8d99\u5c90 defines them as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin, Duke Xiang of Song, and King Zhuang of Chu. The book Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 identifies them with Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, King Zhuang of Chu, King Hel\u00fc of Wu and King Goujian of Yue.\n\nThe Disintegration of the Old Order of Regional States\n\nIn the mid-5th century BCE there were four states that dominated old China: Chu in the south, Yue in the southwest, Jin in the north, and Qi in the east. Yet things were to change soon: Inner conflicts toppled two of the reigning houses (Jin and Qi), new powers emerged (Wei \u9b4f, Zhao \u8d99 and Han \u97d3), and reforms in the administration of several states created a new type of \"modernized\" regional state: the centralized state with a strengthened \"national\" economy and a professional army. The administration of the state by nobles related to the ruling house was replaced by a bureaucratic officialdom.\n\nThe state Lu was the first that felt the power of noble families which challenged the ducal house, in this case the Three Huan (Sanhuan \u4e09\u6853, descendants of Duke Huan \u9b6f\u6853\u516c) the Jisun \u5b63\u5b6b, Mengsun \u5b5f\u5b6b (Zhongsun \u4ef2\u5b6b) and Shusun \u53d4\u5b6b. From the time of Duke Xi \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) on these three noble families dominated the state of Lu. Duke Zhao \u9b6f\u662d\u516c (r. 541-510) even had to escape from their intrigues and died abroad. At the beginning of the fifth century minor nobles like Nan Kuai \u5357\u84af, Yang Hu \u967d\u864e and Hou Fan \u4faf\u72af rebelled against the mighty families and took over the rule of Lu.\n\nDescendants of the dukes of Song fought for the domination within the small state: the families Hua \u83ef, Yue \u6a02, Lao \u8001, Huang \u7687 (descendants of Duke Dai \u5b8b\u6234\u516c, r. 799-766), Yu \u9b5a, Dang \u8569, Lin \u9c57 and Xiang \u5411 (descendants of Duke Huan \u5b8b\u6853\u516c, r. 681-651). In the permanent power struggles only the families Yue and Huang survived the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nThe seven descendant lineages of Duke Mu of Zheng \u912d\u7a46\u516c (r. 627-606) also gradually lost their power in the course of the Spring and Autum period.\n\nIn the state of Qi, the government was led by the lineages of Guo \u570b, Gao \u9ad8, Cui \u5d14 and Qing \u6176. In this state it was a family not related to the ducal house that took over power in Qi: the family Tian \u7530, descendants of a prince from Chen, Tian Jingzhong \u7530\u656c\u4ef2, who had come to Qi in 672 while escaping internal disturbances in Chen. Under Duke Jing \u9f4a\u666f\u516c (r. 547-490), Jingzhong's descendant Tian Qi \u7530\u4e5e was ennobled and from this position collected wealth and power enough to annihilate the families Guo and Gao. His son Tian Chang \u7530\u5e38 was already wealthier than the Duke himself and sent his ambassadors to the neighbouring states. His descendants would eventually replace the reigning house in Qi.\n\nThe most tremendous power challenge from within took place in the state of Jin where descendants of the ducal line were not invested as regional governors (dafu \u5927\u592b). But this measure did not prevent other noble families from trying to dominate the court of Jin: Hu \u72d0, Zhao \u8d99, Xian \u5148, Xi \u90e4 and Xu \u80e5 were the dominating noble clans of the middle Spring and Autumn period, and were later replaced by the families Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f, Luan \u6b12, Fan \u8303 and Xun \u8340. At the beginning of the 5th century the noble families of Zhao, Wei, Han, Fan, Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c and Zhi \u667a survived the internal struggle. The three first could destroy the last three and dissolved the dukedom of Jin, dividing its territory among themselves.\n\nDuring the reign of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 607-586), the southern ruler King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) advanced his armies as far as the valley of River Luo in the pursuit of the Rong tribes of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e. The king of Chu used this situation pay the king of Zhou a visit, but King Ding only sent Prince Man \u6eff (\"Royal Grandson Man\" \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff) to confer with the semi-barbarian king of Chu. They talked about the so-called \"nine tripods\" (jiuding \u4e5d\u9f0e) erected in the capital that symbolized the nine regions of the kingdom of Zhou.\n\nAfter the death of King Ling of Zhou \u5468\u9748\u738b (r. 572-545) and during the reign of King Jing \u5468\u666f\u738b (r. 545-521) a succession crisis beset the house of Zhou. The heir apparent, Prince Sheng \u8056, had died prematurely. King Jing preferred his oldest son Prince Chao \u671d, yet when the king died, Prince Gai \u4e10 was supported by a strong party among the courtiers. The highest ministers enthroned Prince Meng \u731b, who was immediately attacked and killed by the adherents of Prince Chao. Prince Meng is posthumously known as King Dao \u5468\u60bc\u738b (r. 521-520). Prince Chao proclaimed himself king of Zhou, yet Prince Gai on his side asked for support by the duke of Jin and finally made it to the throne. He is known as King Jing \u5468\u656c\u738b (r. 520-476). Prince Chao, who had reigned for four years, fled to Chu. In 504, when he had assembled a sufficient number of supporters, he attacked King Jing and forced him to flee to Jin. A year later Duke Ding of Jin \u6649\u5b9a\u516c (r. 512-475) helped King Jing back on the throne."}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/A_History_Of_Chu_Volume_3.html?id=nNhDEAAAQBAJ", "page_content": "The fruit of late historian and accomplished Chu expert Zhang Zhengming\u2019s long and dedicated research, A History of Chu reveals the intriguing history of a powerful feudal state in the Zhou dynasty.

For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride.\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao Chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province.

It belonged to the larger polities that were able to survive until the end of the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE). Chu is known for its culture that was significantly different from that of the states of the Central Plain. Chu was not among the states that were distributed as a regional states at the beginning of the Western Zhou period \u897f\u5468 (11th cent.-770 BCE). Its ruling dynasty was of a different origin than most of the regional dynasties of the Zhou empire. Another name of Chu is Jing \u834a. Chu was first located in the valley of the River Han \u6f22 and then moved southeast into the Yangtze Valley. During the Spring and Autumn period \u6625\u79cb (770 - 5th cent. BCE) it gradually expanded towards the north and east.\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Chu \u695a (11th cent. - 223 BCE) Map according to Tan Qixiang \u8c2d\u5176\u9aa7 (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji \u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u96c6. Chu was located in the middle course of the Yangtze River and gradually expanded to the east and northeast. It played the role of temporary ally for the states of Qi and Qin, before the latter dominated over all regional states and founded the empire of Qin. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe semi-barbarian state of Chu becomes part of the middle kingdom\n\nThe ruling house of Chu derived its descendancy from the mythical Emperor Zhuan Xu \u9853\u980a, himself being a grandson of the Yellow Emperor \u9ec3\u5e1d. Zhuan Xu's great-grandson Zhong Li \u91cd\u9ece was the minister for fire (huo zheng \u706b\u6b63) of the mythical Emperor Di Ku \u5e1d\u56b3. For his merits earned in office, Zhong Li was bestowed the name of Zhu Rong \u795d\u878d. He was sent out to punish the rebellious lord of the waters, Gong Gong \u5171\u5de5, but Zhu Rong/Zhong Li was unable to kill Gong Gong. Enraged about this failure, Emperor Di Ku executed Zhong Li and had his brother Wu Hui \u5433\u56de take over the duties as minister of fire. Wu Hui had six grandsons that were called Kun Wu \u6606\u543e, Shen Hu \u53c3\u80e1, Peng Zu \u5f6d\u7956, Hui Ren \u6703\u4eba, Ji Lian \u5b63\u9023 and an unnamed son that was given the family name of Cao \u66f9. Five branches of the family fell into oblivion, except the descendants of Ji Lian who adopted the family name of Xiong \u718a or Mi \u7f8b (originally written \u5b2d).\n\nExcavated objects from the late Warring States period prove that the reigning dynasty of Chu also bore the family name Yan \u9153. Mi Xiong allegedly took part in King Wu's \u5468\u6b66\u738b conquest of the Shang empire \u5546 (17th-11th cent. BCE).\n\nIn the early decades of the Zhou period, King Cheng of Zhou \u5468\u6210\u738b (r. 1116-1079 BCE) made the family Mi regional rulers over the country of Chu in the middle Yangtze valley. From that time on they adopted the family name Mi, yet the rulers retained the surname Xiong. Xiong might also be a prefix of the personal name worn by all members of the family. In the late 11th century King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b undertook several military campaigns against Chu during one of which he died, while his own army drowned in the River Han. The rulers of Chu called themselves \"king\" (wang \u738b) and therefore demonstrated that they were actually not part of the system of regional states of the Zhou empire.\n\nYu Xiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi \u718a\u7e79 settled near Mt. Jingshan \u834a\u5c71 (modern Nanzhang \u5357\u6f33, Hubei) and, after being appointed regional ruler (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) by King Cheng of Zhou, moved to Danyang \u4e39\u967d (modern Zigui \u79ed\u6b78, Hubei).\n\nViscount (zi \u5b50) Xiong Qu \u718a\u6e20 became aware that the house of Zhou was weakening and expanded his rule along the middle Yangtze valley up into the valley of River Han. He conquered the statelets of Yong \u5eb8 and Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5. He made his oldest song Wukang \u6bcb\u5eb7 king of Goutan \u53e5\u4eb6, his second son Zhihong \u646f\u7d05 king of E \u9102, and his youngest son Zhici \u57f7\u75b5 king of Yuezhang \u8d8a\u7ae0. Later on he feared that the king of Zhou would attack him because of the usurpation of the title of king and stripped his sons off their ranks as kings.\n\nAfter the death of Viscount Xiong Shuang \u718a\u971c his three sons indeed contended for the throne of Chu. The youngest son, Jixun \u5b63\u5f87 (Xiong Xun \u718a\u5f87), was finally able to occupy the throne. When Fen Mao \u86a1\u5192 (r. 758-741), also called Xiong Xun \u718a\u7734, died, his younger brother Xiong Tong \u718a\u901a assassinated the heir apparent and usurped the throne. He is posthumously called King Wu of Chu \u695a\u6b66\u738b (r. 741-690) because he carried out numerous military campaigns, like that against the statelet of Sui \u96a8, whose marquis, hoping to escape defeat, offered to Xiong Tong to travel to the court of the King of Zhou to reconfirm Xiong Tong in his royal position, but the King of Zhou declined. Enraged about the King of Zhou's refusal, Xiong Tong decided to adopt the title of king without the permission by the Son of Heaven, concluded an alliance with the marquis of Sui and occupied the territory of the hundred Pu tribes \u767e\u6fee south of the Yangtze River. Xiong Tong later suspected the marquis of Sui of treason and planned to occupy his territory, but he died en route to the battlefield.\n\nHis son Xiong Zi \u718a\u8cb2 mounted the throne. Zi is posthumously known as King Wen \u695a\u6587\u738b (r. 690-677). He was the first ruler of Chu who took residence in Ying \u90e2 (near modern Shashi \u6c99\u5e02, Hubei) instead of Danyang. Xiong Zi conquered several small states, like Xi \u606f (modern Xixian \u606f\u7e23\uff0c Henan), Shen \u7533 (modern Nanyang \u5357\u967d, Henan) and Deng \u9127 (modern Xiangfan \u8944\u6a0a, Hubei). His son Zhuang'ao \u838a\u6556 (ao was a kind of temple name, like the Chinese zong \u5b97), known as Xiong Jian \u718a\u56cf (also written \u718a\u8271), planned to kill his brother Xiong Yun \u718a\u60f2 (also written \u718a\u9835), but the latter escaped to Sui and gained sufficient support to usurp the throne of his brother. Xiong Yun is posthumously known as King Cheng \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 672-626). Unlike his predecessors, King Cheng was a peaceful ruler who sent appropriate tributes to the court of the king of Zhou, so that he was ordered to appease the barbarian tribes of the south instead of harassing the states in the Yellow River plain.\n\nIn 656 the hegemonial lord (ba \u9738) Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) attacked Chu, but King Cheng was able to urge his troops to stop and concluded a peace alliance (meng \u76df) in the conference of Zhaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan). In his later years King Cheng waged war against the statelets of Xu \u8a31, Xian \u5f26 (near modern Xixian, Henan), Huang \u9ec3 (modern Huanchuan \u6f62\u5ddd, Henan) and Ying \u82f1. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637), the new hegemonial lord, dispatched an envoy to Chu to offer a peaceful alliance, but the king refused and soon attacked Song \u5b8b and defeated the duke in the battle of Hong \u6cd3 (modern Zhecheng \u67d8\u57ce, Henan) and also the state of Zheng \u912d. Duke Xiang died from a wound received during the battle.\n\nIn 634 Duke Xi of Lu \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) arrived at the court of Chu and requested an army to punish the Duke of Qi \u9f4a. King Cheng sent out the Marquis of Shen \u7533 who conquered the territory of Gu \u7a40, where Duke Huan's son Yong \u96cd was instated as the local governor. The other sons of the Duke of Qi fled to Chu and were all made nobles in Chu. The statelet of Kui \u5914 was conquered, and then King Cheng attacked the state of Song. The Duke of Song requested support by the army of Jin \u6649. King Cheng thereupon withdrew because Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628), had been his exiled guest for a long time, and sent only out Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 with a small contingent that was defeated.\n\nAgainst the advice of Prime Minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Zishang \u5b50\u4e0a, King Chen nominated his beloved son Shangchen \u5546\u81e3 heir apparent. Later on he deposed Shangchen in favour to Zhi \u8077. Shangchen thereupon arrested King Cheng and forced him to commit suicide. He mounted the throne, posthumously called King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 626-614). His chief counsellor was Pan Chong \u6f58\u5d07. King Mu conquered the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f (modern Xixian, Henan) and Lu \u516d (a special reading, modern Lu'an \u516d\u5b89, Anhui) and attacked the state of Chen \u9673.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son L\u00fc \u4fb6, who is posthumously known as King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 614-591). King Zhuang did not attend the court, indulged in pleasures and even ordered to execute those who dared remonstrating against him. Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 thereupon used a riddle to admonish him, but without success. Only Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e was able to open the king's eyes so that he started caring for political matters again. During his campaign against the Rong barbarians \u620e of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, King Zhuang visited the capital of the kings of Zhou in Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan) and was received by royal grandson Man \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff. The latter convinced him that the Heavenly Mandate (tianming \u5929\u547d) of the Zhou dynasty had not yet ended, in spite of the obvious weakness of the royal house.\n\nIn 597 Chu defeated the army of Jin near Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan). In 594 Chu besieged the capital of Song for five months and conquered the statelet of Yong \u5eb8 (near modern Zhushan \u7af9\u5c71, Hubei), later Shu-Liao \u8212\u84fc (modern Shucheng \u8212\u57ce, Anhui) and Xiao \u856d (near modern Xuzhou \u5f90\u5dde, Jiangsu).\n\nAfter the conquest of Chen, King Zhuang wanted to transform it into a district of Chu, but Shen Shu \u7533\u53d4 of Qi criticized the king, so that he reinstated the house of Chen. Yet his next step was to conquer the state of Zheng. After the lord of Zheng had begged for mercy, King Zhuang released him and created an alliance of peace. In 575 the army of Chu defeated the relieve army from Jin in the battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan). The rule of King Zhuang is seen as the apogee of the power of the state of Chu among the regional states of the Zhou period. He was accepted as hegemonial lord (ba \u9738).\n\nKing Zhuang was succeeded by his son Shen \u5be9, posthumously known as King Gong \u695a\u5171\u738b (r. 591-560). During his reign the army of Chu was defeated by Jin. The next ruler was King Gong's son Zhao \u62db, posthumously known as King Kang \u695a\u5eb7\u738b (r. 560-545). The latter was succeeded by his son Yuan \u54e1, who is also known as Jia'ao \u90df\u6556 (r. 545-541). King Kang had four younger brothers called Wei \u570d, Zibi \u5b50\u6bd4, Zixi \u5b50\u6673 and Qiji \u5f03\u75be. Wei was made Prime Minister and commander of the army. When Jia'ao fell ill, Wei entered the palace, strangulated the king and killed his sons Mo \u83ab and Pingxia \u5e73\u590f. Zibi fled to Jin, while Wei mounted the throne. He is posthumously known as King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 541-529).\n\nChu as a major power of the Warring States\n\nKing Ling was able to assemble the regional rulers and to take over the lead as a factual hegemon of the regional states. Minister Wu Ju warned the king to become over-confident in his superior role, yet King Ling commanded the regional states in a campaign against the state of Wu \u5433. Qing Feng \u6176\u5c01, the commander of the troops of Wu, was kept prisoner, but dared criticizing King Ling for the way his fathers had come to the throne of Chu, and was therefore immediately executed by the king. He had the Zhanghua Terrace \u7ae0\u83ef\u81fa built where he received noble refugees from other states. Prince Qiji was ordered to attack the state of Chen, and King Ling invited the marquis of Cai \u8521 in order to poison him. Prince Qiji conquered the headless state of Cai and usurped the throne of the small marquisate.\n\nIn 530 BCE, King Ling attacked the small state of Xu \u5f90, located northwest of the state of Wu, and Lai \u8cf4 (modern Suizhou \u96a8\u5dde, Hubei). Chen was heavily deafeated and its dynasty brought to an end. At that moment, King Ling deliberated with his nobles whether he was strong enough to claim the same rights as the other regional rulers. Grand master (dafu \u5927\u592b) Xi Fu \u6790\u7236 answered that in old times, the state of Chu had been a very remote and less developed country, but now the King of Zhou would not refuse to bestow to the King of Chu bronze tripods as a symbol of royal power, and none of the other states would refuse to exchange gifts with the state of Chu.\n\nWhen King Ling was on campaign against Wu in the camp of Ganxi \u4e7e\u6eaa, the king of Wu was advised by Guan Cong \u89c0\u5f9e, a son of a noble of Cai whom King Ling had killed. The King of Wu joined a secret alliance with the state of Yue \u8d8a, whose nobleman Chang Shouguo \u5e38\u58fd\u904e had also been insulted by the king of Chu. Wu and Yue attacked Cai and won over Qiji, who was able to kill the heir apparent of Chu, Prince Lu \u797f. Zibi was enthroned as king of Chu, Zixi was made Prime Minister, and Qiji Minister of War (sima \u53f8\u99ac). Guan Cong thereupon travelled to the camp of King Ling and presented him with the facts of the rebellion at home. The army of Chu dispersed and left the king alone. King Ling wandered around in the wilderness and finally died of hunger because the new ruler had forbidden giving him anything to eat.\n\nThe new king, Zibi, was for a long time in an unclear state about the whereabouts of King Ling, and finally committed suicide, together with Zixi. Qiji renamed himself Xiong Ju \u718a\u5c45 and proclaimed himself king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 527-516).\n\nIn fear of revenge, King Ping demonstrated a benevolent government towards the common people and restored the territories of the states of Chen and Cai, enthroning members of the former ruling houses. The eastern parts of Chu were plundered by the armies of Wu during this interlude of internal war in Chu.\n\nKing Ping decided to marry his son, Crown Prince Jian \u5efa, with a princess from Qin \u79e6. Yet the girl was so beautiful that the king decided to take her for himself, and she gave birth to Prince Zhen \u8eeb. Grand Tutor (taifu \u592a\u5085) Wu She \u4f0d\u5962 and Junior Tutor (shaofu \u5c11\u5085) Fei Wuji \u8cbb\u7121\u5fcc intrigued against each other and instigated in the king the fear that the crown prince might prematurely usurp the throne. Prince Jian thereupon fled to the court of Song. Wu She's son Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5, who was an excellent strategist, was able to escape to the state of Wu, the arch-enemy of Chu.\n\nThe mother of Prince Jian was captured by the army of Wu when Prince Guang \u5149 of Wu was campaigning against Chen and Cai. A small border clash in Beiliang \u5351\u6881 lead to an armed conflict between Chu and Wu, in which Wu conquered the territories of Zhongli \u9418\u96e2 and Juchao \u5c45\u5de2. King Ping was so threatened that he began fortifying the capital city Ying. When King Ping died, the nobles wanted to enthrone his younger brother Prince Zixi \u5b50\u897f, but he refused, so that the under-age prince Zhen was enthroned as ruler of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489).\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Prime Minister Zichang \u5b50\u5e38 took revenge for Prince Jian and Wu She and killed the intriguer Fei Wuji. The reason for this was that a many nobles had fled to Wu, where they supported the troops of Chu against the own dynasty in Chu. Yet there were also some princes of Wu escaping trouble in the own country at the court of Chu.\n\nIn 509 BCE the army of Chu, commanded by Prince Zichang, was heavily defeated by Wu in the battle of Baiju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). Wu Zixu as one of the competent military leaders of Wu even managed to conquer the capital of Chu in 506. As a revenge for the execution of his father, Wu Zixu had the tomb of King Ping desecrated. Commander Prince Zichang fled to the state of Zheng. King Zhao himself escaped to Yunmeng \u96f2\u5922 and then on to the former state of Sui, where he was hidden by his loyal courtiers and the population from the army of Wu.\n\nIn the meantime, minister Shen Baoxu \u7533\u9b91\u80e5 was sent to the state of Qin to ask for relief troops, which were indeed able to defeat the troops of Wu that had advanced far into the country of the enemy until they reached Ji \u7a37 (modern Tongbai \u6850\u67cf, Henan). Prince Fugai \u592b\u6982, brother of the king of Wu, usurped the throne on this occasion but was driven out by the righteous king and fled to the court of Chu.\n\nStill on his way back to the capital, King Zhao of Chu swallowed the state of Tang \u5510 (near modern Suizhou, Hubei), then Dun \u9813 (modern Shangshui \u5546\u6c34, Henan) and Hu \u80e1 (modern Fuyang \u961c\u967d, Anhui). There was another occasion in 504 when the army of Wu again invaded the state of Chu. Only with the death of King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad of Wu (r. 514-496) the attention of Wu was directed against the state of Yue, and the danger from the east was gone.\n\nOn his sickbed, King Zhao wanted to cede the throne to his younger brother, yet all nobles refused, before Prince Zil\u00fc \u5b50\u95ad conceded to become the successor of his brother. Yet when the King died on a campaign, the brothers decided to enthrone the king's son, Prince Zhang \u7ae0. He is posthumously known as King Hui \u695a\u60e0\u738b (r. 489-432). In 488 Prince Zixi invited the former Prince Jian's son Prince Sheng \u52dd to come back to Chu. He was granted the title of Duke Bai \u767d\u516c. Duke Bai planned to revenge his father's death, who had been killed in exile in Zheng.\n\nIn 481 BCE, the army of Jin attacked Zheng, and Zheng asked Chu for help. Instead of annihilating Zheng, commander Zixi left Zheng untouched. Duke Bai thereupon killed Zixi, Prince Ziqi \u5b50\u7da6 and Prime Minister Sima Ziqi \u53f8\u99ac\u5b50\u671f at the court and tried to kidnap King Hui. Yet the king was protected by his retainers and took refuge in the palace of the Queen Dowager of King Zhao.\n\nDuke Bai thereupon proclaimed himself king, but was assassinated by Prince Zigao \u5b50\u9ad8, called Duke Ye \u8449\u516c. In this year, Chu finally destroyed the state of Chen, in 447 the state of Cai, and in 445 the state of Qi \u675e.\n\nIn 473, the armies of Yue had finally destroyed the state of Wu. In the northern parts of Wu, along the plain of the River Huai \u6dee, Chu began to expand its territory. King Hui was succeeded by his son Prince Zhong \u4e2d, who is posthumously known was King Jian \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. 432-408). Under his reign, Chu conquered the statelet of Ju \u8392 (modern Juxian \u8392\u7e23, Shandong) that had belonged to the territory of Qi. King Jian employed the famous military advisor Wu Qi \u5433\u8d77, who reformed the army, so that Chu was able to conquer the southern regions inhabited by the non-Chinese peoples of the Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5, namely the Dongting \u6d1e\u5ead (Hunan) and Cangwu \u84bc\u68a7 (Guizhou) regions.\n\nKing Jian was succeeded by his son Prince Dang \u7576, posthumously known as King Sheng \u695a\u8072\u738b (r. 408-402). King Sheng was killed by \"robbers\" (presumably nobles or family members) and was succeeded by his son Prince Yi \u7591, posthumously known as King Dao \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. 402-381). Under his reign, Chu contended with the troops of the new states of Han \u97d3, Zhao \u8d99 and Wei \u9b4f, the successor states of Jin. King Dao was succeeded by his son Prince Zang \u81e7, posthumously known as King Su \u695a\u8085\u738b (r. 381-370). Because King Su had no sons, he left the throne to his younger brother Prince Liangfu \u826f\u592b, who is posthumously known as King Xuan \u695a\u5ba3\u738b (r. 370-340). At the end of the latter's reign, the armies of Qin attacked Chu. At that time, Qin was governed by counsellor Shang Yang \u5546\u9785.\n\nKing Xuan's son Prince Shang \u5546 succeeded to the throne in Chu, posthumously known as King Wei \u695a\u5a01\u738b (r. 340-329). He was able to defeat the armies of the state of Qi, which was at that time disturbed by inner quarrels. King Wei also defeated the armies of the kingdom of Yue and occupied a large part of its territory, so that Chu was now the sole state in the southern parts of China. In 306, Yue was destroyed by Chu.\n\nChu as a large but weak state between Qin and Qi\n\nWhen King Wei died, the state of Wei used this opportunity and conquered part of its northern territory. King Wei's successor was his son Prince Guai \u69d0, posthumously known as King Huai \u695a\u61f7\u738b (r. 329-299). In 323 BCE he took revenge and attacked the territory of Wei, seizing eight counties. The next military target was the state of Qi, yet at that time the military adviser Chen Zhen \u9673\u8eeb dwelled at the court of Qi and was dispatched to the camp of counsellor Zhao Yang \u662d\u967d, highest commander of the army of Chu. Chen Zhen persuaded Zhao Yang with the parable of drawing feet to a snake that he would have no advantage in defeating the army of Qi, so that Zhao Yang withdrew. At least, Chu was able to conclude an alliance with the states of Qin, Wei and Qi that was initiated by the famous diplomatist Zhang Yi \u5f35\u5100.\n\nThis alliance became important in 318 BCE, when an alliance, concluded with the help of Su Qin \u8607\u79e6, attacked the state of Qin. King Huai took over the lead of the allies and penetrated into the Hangu Pass \u51fd\u8c37\u95dc, yet the allies withdrew without forcing Qin to battle.\n\nIn 313, things had changed and Chu was in alliance with Qi. The king of Qin decided to send Zhang Yi to Chu in order to persuade King Huai to change side again and, in the end, to isolate Chu. Chen Zhen was well aware of this and warned King Huai, but he refused to accept the warning. In the end, the enraged king of Qi concluded an alliance with Qin. King Huai, on his side, made ready the troops for a campaign against Qin. Again, Chen Zhen warned the king and suggested offering Qin a city to restore the former alliance. King Huai ignored the warning, and so the army of Qin destroyed that of Chu at Danyang \u4e39\u967d in 312, captured a huge humber of troops and officers, and occupied the region of Hanzhong \u6f22\u4e2d. At Lantian \u85cd\u7530, the armies battled a second time, and the fresh defeat of Chu instigated Han and Wei to seize some more territory from Chu.\n\nA year later, Qin suggested concluding peace and sent Zhang Yi to the court of Chu. King Huai immediately arrested Zhang Yi and planned to kill him, but Zhang established contact with Jin Shang \u9773\u5c1a, who explained to King Huai that Qin would attack Chu again. He also spoke with the King's favourite, Lady Zheng Xiu \u912d\u8896, and threatened her that the king of Qin would try to purchase peace by sending beautiful girls to King Huai. The Lady then managed the release of Zhang Yi, and peace was made with Qin. Shortly after, the Chu embassador to Qi returned, Qu Yuan \u5c48\u539f, and reproached the king for not having executed Zhang Yi.\n\nIn 310 BCE, the King Min of Qi \u9f4a\u6e63\u738b (r. 324-284) sent an envoy to the court of Chu and explained that, after the death of King Hui in Qin, the situation had changed thoroughly, and suggested to conclude a common alliance with Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan \u71d5 against Qin. Zhao Ju \u662d\u96ce convinced King Huai that it was better to be part of the alliance around Qi and to win back the territory once lost to Qin. Yet in 307, King Huai decided that he could also win territory by concluding a peaceful alliance with Qin. Two years later Qin, Han and Wei attacked Chu for its betrayal of the alliance. King Huai sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qin and requested military support against the three states.\n\nIn 304, the crown prince of Chu had a private quarrel with some nobles of Qin. When he accidentally killed one of them, he fled and returned to Chu. In order to take revenge for the murder, Qin attacked Chu, supported by troops of Qi, Han and Wei, and defeated Chu at Chuisha \u5782\u6c99. A year later, Qin undertook a second campaign against Chu and heavily defeated the army of Chu. King Huai thereupon sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qi, an ally of Qin, and requested peace.\n\nOnly after a further campaign and after King Zhao of Qin had sent an urgent letter, King Huai of Chu consented to a meeting with the king of Qin at the Wuguan Pass \u6b66\u95dc. Yet King Huai did not trust Qin and feared that he might be caught in a trap. Zhao Ju suggested not to meet the king of Qin, but the King's younger son urged him to go. In the end, King Huai was escorted to Xianyang \u54b8\u967d, the capital of Qin, and was threatened to cease territory before concluding an alliance. He refused and was arrested and detained.\n\nAt home, the situation was precarious. Both the king and the crown prince were held hostages in Qin, and Zhao Ju argued that it was against etiquette to enthrone a younger son as long as the ruler was living. This meant that there was no head of government as long as King Huai was in Qin. The court brooded over the issue and finally invited Prince Heng \u6a6b to come to the capital Ying. He was enthroned as king of Ch, posthumously known as King Qingxiang \u695a\u9803\u8944\u738b (r. 299-263).\n\nThe king of Qin thereupon continued his campaigning against Chu, defeated its army, and seized territory in the north. A year later, King Huai managed to escape, but because the roads to Chu were blocked by Qin, he fled to the state of Zhao, but fearing the anger of Qin, King Huiwen of Zhao \u8d99\u60e0\u6587\u738b (r. 299-266) refused to offer protection. King Huai was finally captured by the bloodhounds of Qin and brought back to Xianyang, where he died a year later. At least, his corpse was allowed to be transferred back to his native state, where he was buried with greatest honours.\n\nIn 293 BCE, general Bai Qi \u767d\u8d77 massacred the army of Han. Threatened by this cruel way of warfare, King Qingxiang agreed to conclude a marriage of peace with Qin. This new alliance led to a campaign in 284, carried out by Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan and targeted against the state of Qi in the east. Chu so regained the region of Huaibei \u6dee\u5317. In 281, King Qingxiang was persuaded to resume war against Qin, in order to gain more territory. He first concluded an alliance with Qin and Han and planned to use this opportunity to conquer some territory of the patriarchal kings of Zhou around Luoyang. King Nan of Zhou \u5468\u738b\u8d67 (r. 315-256) thereupon sent his relative, Duke Wu \u6b66\u516c, to Zhaozi \u662d\u5b50, the counsellor of Chu. Duke Wu explained to Zhaozi that the destruction of the house of Zhou meant a thorough dissolution of the world order and would bring only chaos to the state of Chu. King Qingxiang thereupon abandoned this plan.\n\nThe campaigns against Qin continued, but in 278 BCE, general Bai Qi advanced to the capital of Chu and defiled the tombs of the kings of Chu. The capital of Chu was moved to the ancient site of Chen (modern Huaiyang \u6dee\u967d, Henan) It was only in 276 that the army of Chu was able to recover some of its core territory. Chu was even able to supporte Han, Zhao and Wei in a campaign against Yan. This was only possible because of an armistice bargained with Qin, covered by the crown prince as a hostage dwelling in Qin.\n\nWhen King Qingxiang fell ill, his son Prince Xiong Yuan \u718a\u5143 (or Wan \u5b8c) managed to escape from Qin and was enthroned as the new king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Kaolie \u695a\u8003\u70c8\u738b (r. 263-238). The new king immediately appointed his trusted Counsellor-to-the-Left (zuoxi \u5de6\u5f92), Lord Chunshen \u6625\u7533\u541b, as Prime Minister. Under the Lord's administration, the state of Chu was able to recover for a while. The capital was first shifted to Juyang \u5de8\u967d (modern Taihe \u592a\u548c, Anhui), later to to Shouchun \u58fd\u6625 (modern Shouxian \u58fd\u7e23, Anhui) further to the east. Lord Chunshen met with Lord Xinling \u4fe1\u9675\u541b of Wei and forged an alliance that was able to defeat Qin in 257. A year later, Chu conquered the state of Lu.\n\nKing Kaolie was succeeded by his son Prince Dao \u608d (or Yu \u715c), who is posthumously known as King You \u695a\u5e7d\u738b (r. 238-228). Li Yuan \u674e\u5712, a powerful noble, used this personal change to assassinate Lord Chunshen. King You was succeeded by his younger half-brother You \u7336 (or Hao \u90dd), who is posthumously known as King Ai \u695a\u54c0\u738b (r. 228). He only ruled for two months before he was overthrown and killed by his older half-brother Fuchu \u8ca0\u82bb (r. 228-223).\n\nThe rule of the last kings of Chu was overshadowed by a growing military success of the state of Qin that succeedingly conquered the states of Han, Zhao and Wei.

BCE) and was one of the so-called five hegemons (wuba \u4e94\u9738). His personal name was Mi Xiongl\u00fc \u8288\u718a\u4fb6 (also written \u718a\u5442 or \u718a\u65c5). The state of Chu is sometimes called Jing \u834a, and Xiongl\u00fc's posthumous title is also King Yan \u56b4\u738b.\n\nHe succeeded to the throne as son of King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614). King Zhuang started his reign in a style of laissez-faire politics without much caring for the government. His advisors Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 and Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e opened him his eyes, so that he started restructuring the administration and strengthening the royal power with the support of Sunshu Ao \u5b6b\u53d4\u6556. The state took over the care for hydraulic works, dykes and dams, he built up a strong army and quelled the internal rebellion of a certain Ruo Ao \u82e5\u6556 (not King Ruo Ao, r. 791-764). His armies marched to the north, defeated the state of Song \u5b8b and the Rong \u620e barbarians of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, and lined up before the domain of the king of Zhou \u5468.\n\nWith the awareness of his power King Zhuang of Chu menaced the King of Zhou and threatened him that Chu would be able to replace the house of Zhou. The armies of Chu then conquered a handfull of smaller states like Yong \u5eb8, Shu \u8212 and Chen \u9673, and in 602, King Zhuang was able to destroy the army of Jin \u6649 at Bi \u90b2 (modern Xingyang \u6ece\u967d, Henan). Chu thus came to replace Jin as the hegemonial power of the Central States.\n\nSource:\n\nCang Xiuliang \u5009\u4fee\u826f, ed. (1991).

Both textual and material evidence can be interpreted in different ways: hence, whereas some scholars insist that Chu was the cultural Other of the Zhou \u5468 world, other consider it an intrinsic part of the Zhou civilization. To complicate matters more, most of the Chu-related narratives in the transmitted texts were created in the northern part of the Zhou world, and are suspected to reflect \u201cnorthern biases,\u201dFootnote 1 which means that their reliability with regard to the self-image of Chu elites is doubtful.\n\nIt is on this backdrop that we can appreciate the importance of historical and quasi-historical manuscripts recently excavated (or looted) from the Chu tombs. By offering a Chu perspective of its history, they allow us to think anew about Chu's cultural trajectory. In what follows, after a brief outline of the debates over Chu's cultural belonging, I shall survey the newly discovered manuscripts and evaluate their impact on the ongoing research concerning Chu identity.\n\nPREFACE: THE QUESTION OF CHU'S OTHERNESS Traditional scholars were overwhelmingly inclined to view Chu as the cultural Other of the Zhou world. The reasons for this verdict are not difficult to find. Already some of the Western Zhou \u897f\u5468 (ca. 1046\u2013771 BCE) sources indicate considerable enmity between the Zhou realm and the state of Chu. The most notable manifestation of this enmity were campaigns of King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b (r. 975\u2013957 BCE) against Chu in ca. 960\u2013957 BCE. The latter of these campaigns ended in the disastrous loss of royal armies; and the king himself perished. The memory of this humiliation lived for centuries.Footnote 2 Tensions between Zhou and Chu continued into the reign of King Xuan of Zhou \u5468\u5ba3\u738b (r. 828\u2013781 BCE). The ode \u201cPlucking White Millet\u201d (Cai qi \u91c7\u8291) in the Canon of Poems (Shijing \u8a69\u7d93) hails a minister of King Xuan who allegedly invaded and overawed the \u201cSavage Jing\u201d (man Jing \u883b\u834a). Whether or not this term refers to the state of Chu (which often appears under the name Jing or Jing-Chu in early sources) or to other tribesmen of the Han \u6f22 and middle Yangzi basin is debatable,Footnote 3 but elsewhere the Canon of Poems seems to unmistakably signify the state of Chu as a major enemy. Two of the Lu \u9b6f and Shang \u5546 (probably Song \u5b8b) hymns contain references to battles with the Jing-Chu, which, in a Lu hymn, is placed unequivocally aside the alien tribesmen Rong and Di \u620e\u72c4.Footnote 4 These hymns probably date from the Springs-and-Autumns period (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb, 770-453 BCE), yet they do indicate that the tradition of political cum cultural enmity toward Chu that started in the Western Zhou period continued and perhaps strengthened thereafter. Zuo zhuan \u5de6\u50b3 (Zuo Tradition), our major source for the history of the Springs-and-Autumns period, records the rise of Chu and its epic struggle for supremacy in the Zhou world against the northern coalitions, led first by Qi \u9f4a and then by Jin \u6649. A superficial reading of Zuo zhuan will lend support to identification of Chu as a culturally distinct entity. A Lu minister's saying, \u201cThey are not of our kin, their heart must be different\u201d (\u975e\u6211\u65cf\u985e\uff0c\u5176\u5fc3\u5fc5\u7570), is commonly\u2014albeit erroneously\u2014interpreted as pertaining to Chu's \u201cracial\u201d otherness.Footnote 5 This interpretation is wrong, but Zuo zhuan does contain many other negative comments on Chu, which is perceived as a rival of the Xia \u590f entity centered around the Zhou royal clan. Thus, a Jin commander accuses Chu of eliminating many polities established by the Zhou royal clansmen (the Ji \u59ec clan);Footnote 6 and many of Chu leaders, from its prime-minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 (d. 632 BCE) to infamous King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 540\u2013529 BCE) are singled out as arrogant and aggressive statesmen eager to violate rules of ritual and propriety. All this often leaves an impression of the text's overall enmity toward Chu. A careful reading of Zuo zhuan shows that the picture is more complex. Chu is never treated in the text as the cultural Other: in distinction from other southern powers, such as Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a, Chu are never called manyi \u883b\u5937 (\u201csavages\u201d). Some Chu leaders are denigrated indeed, but others\u2014most notably King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613\u2013591 BCE)\u2014are given high respect. Moreover, some of the pejorative remarks about Chu in Zuo zhuan should be read cum grano salis. After all, the very state of Lu, whose statesman opposed relying on Chu who \u201care not of our kin,\u201d was at times closely allied with Chu, seeking its military assistance against the neighboring power of Qi. And the elimination of Zhou clansmen's polities was performed not just by Chu but also by the self-proclaimed defender of the Zhou, the state of Jin.Footnote 7 Actually, some of the imperial readers considered Zuo zhuan too biased in favor of Chu; and some of the exegetes\u2014most notably Zhu Xi \u6731\u71b9 (1130\u20131200)\u2014opined that Zuo zhuan itself was a product of Chu historiography.Footnote 8 Going further in history, in many of the Warring States\u2013period (Zhanguo \u6230\u570b, 453\u2013221 BCE) texts we encounter ever more pronounced enmity toward Chu. In particular, its association with \u201cbarbarians\u201d becomes a commonplace. This association is reiterated throughout the Discourses of the States (Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e),Footnote 9 even though the overall view of Chu in this text is far from negative, and parts of it contain laudatory comments on Chu (see below). A pejorative view of Chu is more explicit in Gongyang zhuan \u516c\u7f8a\u50b3, a rival (to Zuo zhuan) commentary on the Springs-and-Autumns Annals (Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb). Chu is consistently identified in the text as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d (yi \u5937 or yidi \u5937\u72c4) state; it is oddly claimed to have no ranked nobles (which is patently wrong, judging from the Annals\u2019 text itself), and it is frequently treated with undisguised enmity.Footnote 10 One of the Gongyang zhuan statements is particularly important because of its lasting influence on subsequent views of Chu: Chu is the last to submit when there is a True Monarch, and the first to rebel when there is none. They are barbarians (yidi) and immensely hate the Central States. When southern savages and northern barbarians established ties, the Central States were like a thread due to be cut. \u695a\u6709\u738b\u8005\u5247\u5f8c\u670d\uff0c\u7121\u738b\u8005\u5247\u5148\u53db\u3002\u5937\u72c4\u4e5f\uff0c\u800c\u4e9f\u75c5\u4e2d\u570b\uff0c\u5357\u5937\u8207\u5317\u72c4\u4ea4\u3002\u4e2d\u570b\u4e0d\u7d55\u82e5\u7dda\u3002.Footnote 11 This statement\u2014coming from amid one of the most famous passages in the entire Gongyang zhuan\u2014set the framework for discussions of Chu political and cultural position within the Zhou world for millennia to come. It marked Chu as the epitome of the cultural Other, the malevolent polity which can be subjugated only under the reign of the True Monarch, and even then will forever remain prone to rebel. Coupled with a few other pejorative statements toward Chu, e.g., in Mengzi \u5b5f\u5b50 and the Records of the Historian (Shiji \u53f2\u8a18),Footnote 12 the Gongyang zhuan denigration of Chu attained the position of an orthodox view in traditional Chinese scholarship. The traditional view of Chu as a distinct cultural entity was reinforced in the last quarter of the twentieth century, as many discoveries from the Chu tombs brought to light the peculiar, \u201cflamboyant\u201dFootnote 13 style of its mortuary objects. Lothar von Falkenhausen observed: \u201cDazzled by these unique archeological treasures, many scholars and impressionable laypersons had been clinging to the romantic notion that Chu was a separate southern civilization, an elegant and exuberant other to the dour, disciplined Zhou in the north.\u201dFootnote 14 Yet this view of Chu as an \u201calternative civilization\u201d was questioned later in view of subsequent archeological discoveries. The new understanding, summarized by Xu Shaohua in the seminal volume by Constance A. Cook and John S. Major is that \u201cthere is little archeological evidence of a distinctive Chu culture during the Western Zhou times.\u201dFootnote 15 It was only from the Springs-and-Autumns period on that a divergent cultural pattern associated with Chu began emerging, and even then Chu's elite culture remained strongly conformant with the Zhou ritual practices.Footnote 16 This suggests an entirely different cultural trajectory: Chu was not a \u201cbarbarian entity\u201d attracted by the glory of the Zhou culture as hinted in the Mengzi,Footnote 17 but a normative Zhou polity that developed cultural assertiveness in tandem with the increase in its political power.Footnote 18 The difficulty of analyzing Chu's identity derives not only from the complexity of its cultural trajectory but also from the nature of our textual sources. The overwhelming majority of Chu-related accounts in transmitted texts come from the histories produced outside the state of Chu. The Springs-and-Autumns Annals and their commentaries were composed in the states of Lu and Qi; most of the Discourses of the States come from the Zhou royal domain, Lu, and Jin; and so is the case of most of historical anecdotes scattered throughout the Warring States\u2013period texts. While the Chu sections of the Discourses of the States and of Stratagems of Warring States (Zhanguo ce \u6230\u570b\u7b56), as well as segments of Zuo zhuan, may well have incorporated original Chu materials, we have no idea about the degree of editorial intervention by northern compilers in these materials. Look for instance at the Records of the Historian, our major source for pre-imperial history. Even those who do not subscribe to the accusation of Sima Qian \u53f8\u99ac\u9077 (ca. 145\u2013ca. 90 BCE) as the one who \u201cdescribes Chu in the imperialist terms of a northerner,\u201dFootnote 19 would not deny the obvious northern bias in his\u2014and other historical\u2014writings. This consideration should dictate utmost caution in reading these texts. To accept, for instance, the self-identification of Chu as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d polity on the basis of citations in the Discourses of the States and Records of the Historian,Footnote 20 strikes me as a haphazard conclusion. It is on this backdrop that we can appreciate the import of the newly unearthed historical and quasi-historical manuscripts from the state of Chu. These materials comprise several dozen historical anecdotes, a semi-legendary history (Rongchengshi \u5bb9\u6210\u6c0f), a sketchy history of Chu's capitals and royal palaces (Chuju \u695a\u5c45), and a more detailed Chu-focused history of inter-state relations from the eleventh to the early fourth century BCE (Xinian \u7e6b\u5e74). An integrative view of these materials may yield a novel perspective of Chu's self-image. That history writing was\u2014and is\u2014commonly utilized to articulate, strengthen, or shape the collective identity of a cultural, ethnic, or political entity is almost a truism. To be sure, this is just one of a means of strengthening or constructing a separate cultural or political identity, and not necessarily the major one. Yet, the importance of history writing with this regard, especially insofar as the educated segments of the population are concerned, is undeniable.Footnote 21 Paul R. Goldin noted that the emergence of local histories in the Eastern Zhou \u6771\u5468 (770\u2013256 BCE) period may be related to the nascent sense of regional identity.Footnote 22 In what follows I shall check whether or not this observation is valid for the state of Chu. How much do Chu historical texts reflect its separate cultural identity or contribute toward its formation? Do they polemicize with the denigration of Chu's culture in the northern texts? Do they bolster the Chu kings\u2019 legitimacy as potential leaders of All-under-Heaven? Do they present a different picture of Chu's relations with the Zhou polities from the one we have in the received texts? Do they use such common means of strengthening collective identity as focusing on Chu's wars with its rivals, glorifying its victories and lamenting its defeats? By answering these questions I hope to advance toward better understanding both of the issues related to the formation of Chu's identity and of the role of history-writing in the cultural processes during the Zhou era.\n\nCHU HISTORICAL ANECDOTES Didactic anecdotes\u2014short vignettes valued for their edifying messages\u2014are ubiquitous in pre-imperial writings. They permeate most texts later classified as either \u201chistories\u201d (like Discourses of the States and Stratagems of the Warring States), or \u201cphilosophies\u201d (e.g., Han Feizi \u97d3\u975e\u5b50, or L\u00fcshi chunqiu \u5442\u6c0f\u6625\u79cb), and even some of the \u201cclassics\u201d (e.g., Zuo zhuan).Footnote 23 The anecdotes figure prominently in the Shanghai Museum collection of Chu manuscripts, of which they constitute more than a half of the heretofore published titles; they are present, albeit less prominently, among the Chu manuscripts possessed by Qinghua (Tsinghua) University; and a few of them appear in other collections of Chu materials.Footnote 24 It is therefore appropriate to start our discussion of Chu historiography with the survey of these anecdotes. Since the lion's share of the anecdotes comes from the Shanghai Museum collection, I shall focus in what follows on this collection only.Footnote 25 One striking feature of the anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection is what Sarah Allan called their \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d content.Footnote 26 According to Allan's count, of twenty-four vignettes, thirteen come from Chu while the rest are spread throughout most of the Zhou world, coming from Lu (four), Qi (four), and one each from Jin, Zheng \u912d, and Wu \u5433. My own count differs slightly from Allan's, primarily because I count two anecdotes embedded in the same manuscript separately, and also because I follow rearrangements of slips into a different sequence of manuscripts as proposed by a few later redactors.Footnote 27 Yet the differences are minuscule. Putting aside multiple anecdotes related to Confucius and his disciples, we may summarize that Chu vignettes constitute just slightly over 60 percent of the anecdotes in the Shanghai Museum collection and the percentage will further decrease should we add anecdotes from another sites and collections, which are overwhelmingly non-Chu in their focus.Footnote 28 This allows an immediate observation: members of the Chu educated elite who took anecdotes with them to the final journey to the netherworld appear to be interested in the affairs of the entire Zhou realm rather than being narrowly focused on their own country. The next question will be: to what extent the Chu-related anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection represent aspects of Chu political or cultural identity? To facilitate the discussion of this question I have briefly summarized the content of the anecdotes in Table 1 below. Fifteen Chu anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection cover almost two centuries of Chu history: the earliest (#12) is related to the events of 633 BCE (on the eve of the Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee battle), while the latest (#3) dates from the time of King Jian of Chu \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. ca. 431-405 BCE).Footnote 29 These eventful centuries witnessed the rise of Chu hegemony and a few severe setbacks, glorious victories and disastrous defeats, periods of domestic stability and of woeful turmoil. One may expect that these events will be at the focus of Chu historians\u2019 interest, but this is not the case. Of major battles, for instance, only two are mentioned in the anecdotes, and even they are given a marginal place in the narrative. The Chengpu battle of 632 BCE in which Chu lost its hegemony to the newly rising power of Jin is the backdrop of anecdote #12; yet rather than focusing on the battle, the anecdote just tells a story of military incompetence of Chu's Prime Minster (lingyin) Ziyu \u5b50\u7389. The story closely parallels the Zuo zhuan narrativeFootnote 30 and the picture of Ziyu's inadequacy presented in it mirrors that in Zuo zhuan. That the Chengpu setback is all but glossed over is understandable; yet Chu's successes also generally do not attract the authors\u2019 attention. An exception is the Bi \u90b2 battle of 597 BCE in which King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613\u2013591 BCE) defeated the Jin armies and solidified his hegemony over the Zhou world. This battle\u2014or, more precisely, the events that led to it\u2014are at the center of anecdote #8. The narrative partly parallels Zuo zhuan but also departs from it in a few important details. Most notably, Chu's assault on Zheng which led to the Bi battle is presented as a punitive expedition against Prince Guisheng \u516c\u5b50\u6b78\u751f (aka Zijia \u5b50\u5bb6) of Zheng who assassinated his ruler, Lord Ling \u912d\u9748\u516c, in 605 BCE. This presentation is obviously biased in favor of Chu. As is clear from the very detailed depiction of these events in Zuo zhuan and elsewhere, King Zhuang's assault on Zheng in 597 BCE had nothing to do with penalizing Zijia, who was already dead by then and who in any case was posthumously chastened by Zheng leaders. The real reason for King Zhuang's assault on Zheng was to punish the perfidy of Zheng's rulers, who repeatedly switched allegiance from Chu to Jin and back to Chu. By replacing power consideration with the noble goal of punishing Zijia, the authors of the anecdote legitimate King Zhuang's assault on Zheng. The anecdote further implies that it is due to the king's morality and ritual correctness that he had subjugated Zheng and defeated the Jin army. So is it pure pro-Chu propaganda? Possibly yes, but not necessarily so. As Wei Cide noticed, the anecdote is less concerned with defending King Zhuang's actions, but, rather with the didactic conclusion: only morally justified military campaigns will meet with success.Footnote 31 Hence this anecdote cannot be considered a decisive manifestation of pro-Chu sentiments. Among other anecdotes, only one (#14) mentions military affairs of Chu, but this is done very briefly in the context of discussing correct military training; the list of successful campaigns of the past is not invoked to enhance the country's prestige. At times Chu's military successes are hinted at\u2014e.g., in anecdote #4\u2014but only as a backdrop for discussing the imminent danger of Chu's decline. In general, the anecdotes\u2019 authors are not much interested in Chu's past attainments and display no pride in the country's successes. When another expansionist ruler, King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 540\u2013529 BCE) is mentioned, this is done to reiterate his negative image as an arrogant and intemperate leader rather than to hail his achievements (anecdotes ##5 and 13). The major goal of the Chu-related anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection is not to glorify the militarily prominent Chu kings but rather to extol those monarchs who were able to heed remonstrance and mend their ways. Most of the remonstrance-focused anecdotes revolve around two of the least powerful Chu kings, King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 528\u2013516 BCE) and his son, King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 515\u2013489 BCE). The first of these rose to power in a fratricidal struggle which not only put an end to the reign of King Ling, but also caused a considerable decrease in Chu's international prestige, and the country's territorial contraction. King Zhao encountered an even greater disaster: an assault by Wu armies in 506 BCE caused him to flee the capital and put the entire country on the verge of collapse. As the weakest ruler on the throne of Chu during the period under discussion, King Zhao appears to be more prone than his predecessors or successors to heed remonstrance, mend his behavior, and tolerate criticism. These qualities are hailed in several anecdotes (##1, 2, 9). One's impression is that the authors of the anecdotes prefer weak and compliant kings to those who display extraordinary martial prowess but are also less tolerant of critical-minded aides. To summarize, Chu vignettes from the Shanghai Museum\u2014with the possible exception of anecdote #8\u2014appear to be unconcerned with the country's separate identity, its pride, its glorious past, and the like. Most of these anecdotes lack an identifiable Chu flavor: they could be placed in a different setting and with a different list of protagonists without altering their meaning.Footnote 32 In a few other cases\u2014such as anecdotes ##4 and 5 (which, to repeat, are part of the same manuscript)\u2014there is no doubt that the authors targeted exclusively a Chu audience, because both anecdotes presuppose a high level of knowledge of Chu history, without which they would remain barely comprehensible.Footnote 33 However, these anecdotes, much like the rest surveyed above, are devoid of any visible emphasis on Chu's cultural or political specifics. It may be justifiable to speak of them, and of the heretofore published Chu anecdotes in general, as \u201cidentity-neutral.\u201d This impression strengthens when we take into account non-Chu anecdotes from the Shanghai Museum collection and other materials from Chu tombs. Take for instance a manuscript named Wu ming \u5433\u547d, which revolves around a speech apparently delivered by the messenger of King Fuchai of Wu \u5433\u738b\u592b\u5dee (r. 495\u2013473 BCE) to the Zhou Son of Heaven.Footnote 34 The speech justifies Wu's ongoing war with Chu as defense of the Zhou house; Chu is accused of \u201cacting not in accordance with the Way\u201d (Jing [or Chu ren] wei bu Dao \u834a [or \u695a\u4eba] \u70ba\u4e0d\u9053, slips 4 and 9).Footnote 35 That this accusation appears in a speech attributed to one of Chu's staunchest foes is expectable; but that it is not qualified at all in an anecdote that circulated in the state of Chu, was transcribed into a Chu script, and was buried in a Chu tomb is surprising. The surprise becomes even greater when we notice the Chu manuscripts\u2019 attitudes to the figure of Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5 (d. 484 BCE). Wu Zixu, a son of a high minister of Chu who fell victim to slanderers and was executed by King Ping, vowed to avenge his father's death. He fled to the state of Wu and led its assault against Chu, bringing about Wu's occupation of Chu's capital, Ying, in 506. The occupation was a deeply humiliating and traumatic event; according to the Guliang Commentary (Guliang zhuan \u7a40\u6881\u50b3) on the Springs-and-Autumns Annals, it involved among other things desecration of King Ping's tomb and flogging his corpse.Footnote 36 Wu Zixu made a brilliant career in Wu, but later King Fuchai rejected his advice and ordered him to commit suicide. In due time, Wu Zixu became a paragon of loyalty entering the pantheon of righteous ministers who met an inglorious end.Footnote 37 This perspective, however, is decidedly non-Chu: after all, from the Chu point of view, Wu Zixu should be considered a major enemy, a murderous turncoat. Yet in two of the Chu manuscripts\u2014Poverty and Success are a Matter of Timing (Qiong da yi shi \u7aae\u9054\u4ee5\u6642) from the Guodian collection and Good Ministers (Liang chen \u826f\u81e3) from the Qinghua collection, Wu Zixu is hailed as a model minister without any mention of his anti-Chu deeds.Footnote 38 This latter example further strengthens my tentative conclusion: Chu historical anecdotes, as well as other historical and philosophical texts, lack any visible interest in Chu identity. Their Chu affiliation is marginal to their content. Their focus is decisively supra-regional: they concern the affairs of \u201cAll-under-Heaven\u201d and could be produced in any of the competing states.\n\nCHU JU Aside from multiple anecdotes, recent discoveries of Chu-related histories yielded a few lengthier texts, to which I shall turn now. One of these, Chu Residences (Chu ju \u695a\u5c45), from the first volume of the Qinghua collection, is the first known example of a pure Chu history. This brief text, transcribed on 14 slips, records Chu's history from the semi-legendary progenitor of the Chu royal lineage, Jilian \u5b63\u9023, down to King Dao of Chu \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. ca. 401\u2013381 BCE). It provides a few important details on the early history of Chu,Footnote 39 including, significantly, about the formation of its major aristocratic lineages.Footnote 40 However, as we enter the better known historical period (primarily the eighth century BCE and later), the narrative becomes very sketchy. Its only focus is on the changing location of the country's capitals, or, more precisely, of the ruler's palaces.Footnote 41 Almost no additional information is given: battles, domestic struggles, victories and defeats are all but absent, except in a few cases when they directly influenced the capital's location (for instance, the Ruoao \u82e5\u6556 lineage's revolt of 605 BCE, the Wu occupation of Chu's capital in 506 BCE, and the revolt of Duke of Bai \u767d\u516c in 479 BCE). Sensitive information is not necessarily concealed (as is the case with Xinian, discussed below); it is simply not considered essential. Chu ju is a puzzling text. Who were its audience? One may well read this sketchy, even if informative, text as an early version of a gaokao \u9ad8\u8003 material: a draft reply for an exam on Chu's historical geography. Speaking more seriously, I may speculate that this short survey of Chu's royal residences could be prepared specifically for foreigners in the service of Chu kings. Perhaps dwellings of former rulers possessed a certain ritual or cultic importance that should be clarified to a newcomer to the state of Chu. Maybe this was a kind of sensitive domestic information akin to local taboos and prohibitions which the foreigner should learn upon arrival?Footnote 42 Needless to say this assertion is currently impossible to verify. Chu ju is a useful source of information for those seeking to augment sketchy data in the received sources about early ancestors of the Chu royal lineage, and it contains seeds of heretofore unknown early dynastic legends, but these are less relevant to my discussion.Footnote 43 Here I want to focus on the opening lines of Chu ju, which narrate the story of the primeval ancestor of Chu, Jilian. The story tells: Jilian first descended at Mt. Wei, then arrived at Qiong Cave; advanced to depart from Mt. Qiao, making his dwelling at the Yuan Slope. He moved up the stream of the Chuan River, where he met the son of Pangeng, who lived at Mt. Fang. His (Pangeng's son's) daughter was named Ancestress Zhui. She was the utmost beauty, outshining everybody within the four quarters. Jilian heard of her betrothal and pursued her, reaching her at the waterside. There she gave birth to the elder son Cheng and the second-born Yuan. \u5b63\u9023\u521d\u964d\u4e8e\u9a29\u5c71\uff0c\u62b5\u4e8e\u7a74\u7aae\u3002\u524d\u51fa\u4e8e\u9a55\u5c71\uff0c\u5b85\u8655\u7230\u6ce2\uff08\u5761\uff09\u3002\u9006\u4e0a\u6c4c\u6c34\uff0c\u898b\u76e4\u5e9a\u4e4b\u5b50\uff0c\u8655\u65bc\u65b9\u5c71\u3002\u5973\u66f0\u6bd4\u96b9\uff0c\u79c9\u8332\u7387\u3010\u4e00\u3011\u76f8\uff0c\u8a48 \uff08\u80c4\uff09\u56db\u65b9\u3002\u5b63\u9023\u805e\u5176\u6709\u8058\uff0c\u5f9e\uff0c\u53ca\u4e4b\u76e4\uff0c\u7230\u751f \u4f2f\u3001\u9060\u4ef2\u3002\u3010\u4e8c\u3011Footnote 44 Limitations of space prevent me from adequately dealing with the rich geographical and mythological information in this section; I shall focus on its political aspects only. Jilian\u2014whose \u201cdescending\u201d (jiang \u964d) apparently implies divine birthFootnote 45 \u2014is considered the forefather of the Mi \u7f8b clan, i.e. the royal clan of Chu. Normally he is not identified as the earliest of Chu ancestors. According to the \u201cHereditary house of Chu\u201d chapter in the Records of the Historian, Jilian was preceded by several primordial ancestors, most notably the primeval Thearch Zhuanxu \u9853\u980a and the Rectifier of Fire (huozheng \u706b\u6b63) Zhurong \u795d\u878d.Footnote 46 Chu sacrificial materials from Tomb 2, Baoshan, Jingmen \u834a\u9580\u5305\u5c71 (Hubei), from Tomb 1, Wangshan, Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675\u671b\u5c71 (Hubei), and from Tomb 1 at Geling, Xincai \u65b0\u8521\u845b\u9675 (Henan), all record sacrifices to Zhurong and to his ancestor Laotong \u8001\u50ee, who were apparently considered more worthy of sacrifice than Jilian.Footnote 47 Yet these primeval ancestors are not mentioned at all in Chu ju. Instead the focus is on Jilian and on his relations with the son of the Shang \u5546 king, Pangeng \u76e4\u5e9a, whose daughter Jilian married.Footnote 48 This emphasis on the relations with the Shang ruling lineage suggests that the Shang connection was highly important for the narrators. Evidently, marrying Pangeng's granddaughter was a source of pride for the ancestor of the Chu ruling house, possibly an important asset for bolstering the house's legitimacy and prestige.Footnote 49 The emphasis on Jilian at the expense of his illustrious ancestors and some of his meritorious descendants is significant in the context of my discussion. It shows surprising modesty of the Chu historians who composed the Chu ju. To demonstrate the degree of this modesty it may be useful to compare Chu ju with a rarely noticed piece of pro-Chu propaganda in a transmitted text, namely the Zheng section of the Discourses of the States. The \u201cZheng yu\u201d \u912d\u8a9e narrates an advice given by the Zhou Scribe Bo \u53f2\u4f2f to Lord Huan of Zheng \u912d\u6853\u516c (r. 806\u2013770 BCE) on the eve of the collapse of the Western Zhou. The dating of the text is debatable, but it is likely that it is anterior to Chu ju.Footnote 50 One of the most interesting parts of this text is the section in which Scribe Bo predicts the unstoppable rise of Chu. According to his analysis, Chu's good fortunes derive from the merits of its leaders, past and present: Viscount Xiong Yan of Jing [= Chu] had four sons: [the elder] Boshuang, [the second] Zhongxue, [the third] Shuxiong, and [the youngest] Jixun.Footnote 51 Shuxiong avoided troubles by fleeing to Pu, where he became a savage; hence Jixun was established.Footnote 52 The Wei lineage planned to establish [Shuxiong] but failed to overcome troubles. This means that Heaven opened the path for him [Jixun].Footnote 53 Moreover, he is perspicacious and clear minded, harmonious and amicable; [his merits] exceed those of the former kings. I have heard: one for whom Heaven opens the path cannot be replaced for ten generations. His descendants will surely greatly expand their territory: they cannot be pressed.

Surely this line of argumentation in bolstering Chu's prestige was known to Chu statesmen and historians of the early Warring States period (which is the approximate time of Chu ju compilation).Footnote 59 That they opted to ignore it and to emphasize instead relations of the Mi clan to the Shang king Pangeng cannot be accidental. For whatever reasons, the composers of Chu ju may have considered intermarriage with the Shang royal clan as a more significant factor in supporting the Chu royalty than deeds of meritorious ancestors. Once again, a Chu historical text appears much less concerned with pro-Chu propaganda than could have been expected.\n\nXINIAN Xinian \u7e6b\u5e74 is another bamboo manuscript from the collection of Qinghua University. It is the lengthiest and most detailed historical text unearthed in recent decades. The text is divided into 23 sections that narrate major events from the history of the state of Chu, its rivals, and its allies from the beginning of the Western Zhou period to the early fourth century BCE. As I have discussed its structure, its dating, its potential audience, and the question of its authenticity elsewhere,Footnote 60 I shall focus here on the following topics: the text's relation to the state of Chu, its relevance to our search for traits of separate Chu identity, and the relation between its narration of Chu history and that in Zuo zhuan. Xinian is a composite text that incorporates materials from several Zhou polities; judging from the chronology it applies, these are the Western Zhou royal domain, and the states of Jin and Chu from the Eastern Zhou period. Yet despite the heterogeneity of the source materials, there are clear indications that Xinian was composed and probably edited in the state of Chu. First, each section of the text, except for the first, which narrates exclusively Western Zhou affairs, deals with the state of Chu either directly or through discussing its primary rivals or allies, such as the state of Jin. Second, the geographical perspective of Xinian is obviously biased toward the western part of the Zhou world. For instance, the state of Qin\u2014an important ally of Chu during much of the period under discussion\u2014is covered much more expansively than in other contemporaneous texts,Footnote 61 while eastern states, such as Qi and Lu which played a lesser role in Chu history, are less prominent; thus, the exploits of Lord Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685\u2013643 BCE), which occupy pride of place in Zuo zhuan, are given only marginal attention. Third, the Chu affiliation becomes more pronounced in the last sections of the text, which\u2014uncharacteristically for the rest of Xinian\u2014adopt the Chu chronology even when the narrative deals with Jin. Fourth, there are ritual indications of the text's respect toward the Chu kings: their deaths are invariably recorded as solemnly \u201cpassing away\u201d (jishi \u5373\u4e16), while this courtesy is not uniformly observed with regard to other regional lords.Footnote 62 All this suggests that the text was produced in Chu, although it clearly incorporated non-Chu materials. In marked distinction from Chu ju that focuses on internal history of Chu (or, more precisely, on a single aspect of it, namely the location of royal capitals and palaces), Xinian is preoccupied with Chu's foreign relations. Domestic affairs of Chu are rarely mentioned, and major instances of internal turmoil, such as the coups that first catapulted King Ling into power and then caused his fall, are glossed over. This concealment reminds one of the Springs-and-Autumns Annals, which never report directly about major domestic troubles in the state of Lu.Footnote 63 Yet Xinian does not conceal cases of Chu's military defeats, nor even tries to soften their impact. Let us look at section 21, which deals with the late fifth-century BCE struggle between Jin and Chu: At the seventh year of King Jianda of Chu [i.e., King Jian, r. ca. 431\u2013405 BCE], Lord Dao of Song attended the court audience in Chu, reporting that Pi, Minister of Public Works, acts to weaken the lord's house. The king ordered mo'ao Yang Wei to lead an army to stabilize the lord's house [of Song]. [This army] walled Huangchi and walled Yongqiu.Footnote 64 The Jin [leaders] Wei Si, Zhao Wan, and Han Qizhang led an army laying a siege on Huangchi; they assaulted it and then returned it to Chu.Footnote 65 After two years, the king ordered mo'ao Yang Wei to lead an army to invade Jin. He seized Yiyang and laid a siege to Chiyan so as to retaliate for the Huangchi campaign.Footnote 66 The Jin [leaders] Wei Si, Zhao Wan, and Han Qizhang led an army to assist Chiyan. The Chu army gave up the siege and retreated, and it fought the Jin army near the Long Wall.Footnote 67 The Chu army achieved nothing. They threw away their banners and tents and fled by night. Therefore Chu harbored strong resentment against Jin. \u695a\u7c21\u5927\u738b\u7acb\u4e03\u5e74\uff0c\u5b8b\u60bc\u516c\u671d\u4e8e\u695a\uff0c\u544a\u4ee5\u5b8b\u53f8\u57ce \u4e4b\u7d04\uff08\u5f31\uff1f\uff09\u516c\u5ba4\u3002\u738b\u547d\u83ab\u6556\u967d\u7232\u7387 \u3010114\u3011\u5e2b\u4ee5\u5b9a\u516c\u5ba4\uff0c\u57ce\u9ec3\u6c60\uff0c\u57ce\u96cd\u4e18\u3002\u6649\u9b4f\u65af\u3001\u8d99\u6d63\u3001\u97d3\u5553\u7ae0\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u9ec3\u6c60\uff0c \u8ff5\u800c\u6b78\u4e4b\u3010115\u3011\u65bc\u695a\u3002\u4e8c\u5e74\uff0c\u738b\u547d\u83ab\u6556\u967d\u7232\u7387\u5e2b\u4fb5\u6649\uff0c\u62d5\uff08\u596a\uff09\u5b9c\u967d\uff0c\u570d\u8d64\u5cb8\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fa9\u9ec3\u6c60\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u9b4f\u65af\u3001\u8d99\u6d63\u3001\u97d3\u5553\u3010116\u3011\u7ae0\u7387\u5e2b\u6551\u8d64\u5cb8\uff0c\u695a\u4eba\u820d\u570d\u800c\u9084\uff0c\u8207\u6649\u5e2b\u6230\u65bc\u9577\u57ce\u3002\u695a\u5e2b\u7121\u529f\uff0c\u591a\u68c4\u65c3\u5e55\uff0c\u5bb5\u9041\u3002\u695a\u4ee5\u3010117\u3011\u8207\u6649\u56fa\u7232\u6028\u3002\u3010118\u3011Footnote 68 The story of a continuous tit-for-tat struggle between Jin and Chu is depicted in such a neutral fashion that save from the Chu chronology nothing indicates its Chu origin. The text narrates in detail the humiliating defeat of the Chu armies: first, they abandoned the siege of Jin's Chiyan, retreating to Chu's Long Wall at Fangcheng \u65b9\u57ce; then they were battered there, throwing away \u201cbanners and tents\u201d and fleeing by night. The text which does it best to conceal domestic troubles at Chu, narrates quite candidly how ingloriously its armies fought. This candor becomes even more pronounced in the last section, which depicts a series of Chu-Jin campaigns ca. 400\u2013396 BCE. That section ends with the following passage: After two years (396 BCE?),Footnote 69 Han Qu and Wei Ji led an army and laid siege to Wuyang, to repay the incursion of Gao (of 398 BCE).Footnote 70 The Lord of Luyang led an army to help Wuyang, and fought the Jin army below the Wuyang walls. The Chu army was greatly defeated. Three lords-possessors of the gui tablet, the Duke of Luyang, Duke Daowu of Pingye, and Duke Huanding of Yangcheng, as well as youyin Si of Zhao (Zhao Si), died in that battle;Footnote 71 the Chu forces threw away their banners, tents, chariots and weapons, and returned, running like fleeing dogs. The Chen people thereupon rebelled and let Prince Ding back into Chen.Footnote 72 Thus the state of Chu lost a lot of walled cities. \u53ad\uff08\u85a6\uff1f\uff09\u5e74\uff0c\u97d3\u3010133\u3011\u53d6\u3001\u9b4f\u64ca\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u6b66\u967d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5fa9\u90dc\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u9b6f\u967d\u516c\u7387\u5e2b\u6551\u6b66\u967d\uff0c\u8207\u6649\u5e2b\u6230\u65bc\u6b66\u967d\u4e4b\u57ce\u3010134\u3011\u4e0b\uff0c\u695a\u5e2b\u5927\u6557\uff0c\u9b6f\u967d\u516c\u3001\u5e73\u591c\u60bc\u6b66\u541b\u3001\u967d\u57ce\u6853\u5b9a\u541b\uff0c\u4e09\u57f7\u73ea\u4e4b\u541b\u8207\u53f3\u5c39\u662d\u4e4b\u7ae2\u6b7b\u7109\uff0c\u695a\u4eba\u76e1\u68c4\u5176\u3010135\u3011\u65c3\u5e55\u8eca\u5175\uff0c\u72ac\u9038\u800c\u9084\u3002\u9673\u4eba\u7109\u53cd\u800c\u5165\u738b\u5b50\u5b9a\u65bc\u9673\u3002\u695a\u90a6\u4ee5\u591a\u4ea1\u57ce\u3002Footnote 73 Putting precise details of these campaigns aside we can immediately notice the highly unflattering depiction of Chu military performance in the text. The text not only frankly admits the magnitude of Chu's defeat but even buttresses it through a humiliating comparison of Chu's fleeing armies to running dogs. Clearly, the idea of strengthening the Chu identity and its pride in a or its glorious past was not the concern of Xinian composers. Two above examples suffice to show how candid the Xinian authors are in depicting Chu's military defeats. Nor do they hail the victories too much. The beginning of Chu's territorial expansion is briefly mentioned in sections 2 and 5, but it is not eulogized nor is it connected to any merits of Chu kings. Rather it is presented as coincidental: favorable inter-state circumstances allowed Chu to advance into the Han \u6f22 River valley and beyond. Great victories of Chu under King Zhuang, the singularly successful Chu leader, are noticed but do not merit detailed discussion. Oddly, King Zhuang's exploits are highlighted in Xinian much less than in Zuo zhuan. Nor does the text single out any other Chu leader for exceptional praise. That Xinian is not concerned with Chu's local pride does not require further illustrations. Yet its discovery may allow us to pose another question: How does its presentation of Zhou history differ from that in transmitted sources, especially Zuo zhuan? Since the bulk of Xinian (sections 4\u201319) largely parallels the Zuo zhuan narrative, this allows a meaningful comparison between the two. Elsewhere I have undertaken this comparison and have demonstrated the considerable similarities between the two narratives.Footnote 74 The two texts do differ with regard to certain details, but generally the differences are minor. In a few cases, however, different narration of the same chain of events in Xinian may reflect its authors\u2019 pro-Chu stance. For our discussion the most interesting case is section 16 of Xinian, which differs from Zuo zhuan in a few important details. Let us focus on its account: In the seventh year of King Gong of Chu (r. 590\u2013560 BCE, i.e. in 584 BCE), Prime Minister Zizhong invaded Zheng, initiating the Fan campaign.Footnote 75 Lord Jing of Jin (r. 599\u2013581 BCE) assembled the regional lords to rescue Zheng. The people of Zheng captured [a Chu officer,] Yi, the lord of Yun, and presented him to Lord Jing. Lord Jing returned [to Jin] taking [Yi] with him. [After?] one year (582 BCE?),Footnote 76 Lord Jing wanted to establish amicable relations with Chu; hence, he released the Lord of Yun, and let him go back and seek peace. King Gong of Chu dispatched the Lord of Yun for an official visit to Jin and approved the peace. Lord Jing dispatched Fa of Ji (Ji Fa) for an official visit to Chu, renewing the peace. Before [Ji Fa] returned, [Lord Jing of Jin] died, and Lord Li (r. 580\u2013574 BCE) was established. King Gong dispatched Royal Scion Chen for an official visit to Jin and also renewed the peace. The king also sent the Song Commander-of-the-Right, Huasun Yuan [Hua Yuan] to arrange peaceful relations between Jin and Chu. The next year (579 BCE), Royal Scion Ba of Chu met Wenzi Xie (i.e., Shi Xie \u58eb\u71ee, a.k.a. Shi Wenzi \u58eb\u6587\u5b50) of Jin and nobles of regional lords, and made a covenant at Song, saying: \u201cPut to rest armor and weapons of All-under-Heaven.\u201d The next year (578 BCE), Lord Li [of Jin] was the first to raise an army and lead the regional lords to invade Qin, reaching the Jing River. King Gong also led an army, laying siege at Zheng. Lord Li came to rescue Zheng and defeated the Chu army at Yan.Footnote 77 Lord Li also encountered misfortune, and died leaving no posterity.Footnote 78 \u695a\u5171\u738b\u7acb\u4e03\u5e74\uff0c\u4ee4\u5c39\u5b50\u91cd\u4f10\u912d\uff0c\u7232\uff1f\uff08\u6c3e\uff1f\uff09\u4e4b\u5e2b\u3002\u6649\u666f\u516c\u6703\u8af8\u4faf\u4ee5\u6551\u912d\uff0c\u912d\u4eba\u6b62\u9116\u516c\u5100\uff0c\u737b\u301085\u3011\u8af8\u666f\u516c\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u4ee5\u6b78\u3002\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u6b32\u8207\u695a\u4eba\u7232\u597d\uff0c\u4e43\u812b\u9116\u516c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6b78\u6c42\u6210\uff0c\u5171\u738b\u4f7f\u9116\u516c\u8058\u65bc\u301086\u3011\u6649\uff0c\u4e14\u8a31\u6210\u3002\u666f\u516c\u4f7f\u7cf4\u4e4b\u8337\u8058\u65bc\u695a\uff0c\u4e14\u4fee\u6210\uff0c\u672a\u9084\uff0c\u666f\u516c\u5352\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u5373\u4f4d\u3002\u5171\u738b\u4f7f\u738b\u301087\u3011\u5b50\u8fb0\u8058\u65bc\u6649\uff0c\u53c8\u4fee\u6210\uff0c\u738b\u53c8\u4f7f\u5b8b\u53f3\u5e2b\u83ef\u5b6b\u5143\u884c\u6649\u695a\u4e4b\u6210\u3002\u660e\u6b72\uff0c\u695a\u738b\u5b50\u7f77\u6703\u6649\u6587\u301088\u3011\u5b50\u71ee\u53ca\u8af8\u4faf\u4e4b\u5927\u592b\uff0c\u76df\u65bc\u5b8b\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u723e\uff08\u5f2d\uff09\u5929\u4e0b\u4e4b\u7532\u5175\u3002\u201d \u660e\u6b72\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u5148\u8d77\u5175\uff0c\u7387\u5e2b\u6703\u8af8\u4faf\u4ee5\u4f10\u301089\u3011\u79e6\uff0c\u81f3\u4e8e\u6d87\u3002\u5171\u738b\u4ea6\u7387\u5e2b\u570d\u912d\uff0c\u53b2\u516c\u6551\u912d\uff0c\u6557\u695a\u5e2b\u65bc\u9122\u3002\u53b2\u516c\u4ea6\u898b\u798d\u4ee5\u6b7b\uff0c\u4ea1\uff08\u7121\uff09\u5f8c\u3002\u301090\u3011Footnote 79 This narrative focuses on the first attempt to establish a lasting peace between Chu and Jin\u2014the peace conference in the state of Song in 579 BCE\u2014and the rapid breakup of amicable relations between the two parties thereafter. I shall not focus here on the very minor discrepancies between the Xinian and Zuo zhuan narratives. What matters for me is the core of the story: Who was responsible for the breakup of the first attempt to reconcile two rival powers? The events depicted in Xinian are narrated in great detail in Zuo zhuan, and the two sources agree on the basic facts. What differs, though, is the nature of the peace conference in 579 BCE, and the reasons for its failure. In Zuo zhuan, the conference was attended by just two parties, Jin and Chu; and the covenant (the content of which is cited) focused on establishing amicable relations between the two parties only. In Xinian, in distinction, the meeting was attended also by the \u201cnobles of regional lords\u201d (i.e., was multilateral), and the covenant's goal was attaining peace in \u201cAll-under-Heaven,\u201d similar to the later multilateral peace conferences of 546 BCE and 541 BCE.Footnote 80 On this point, Zuo zhuan appears more reliable: should a 579 BCE peace conference have been attended by more parties, it is likely that this would be reflected in the Springs-and-Autumns Annals as well, which is not the case. It is more plausible that the Xinian authors (or the authors of their source) conflated the agreements of 546 BCE and 541 BCE with that of 579 BCE. What happened after the agreement? Zuo zhuan insists that Chu was perfidious: soon after the covenant was sealed, the Chu lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39 (Prime Minister) warned his visiting Jin colleague that the two rulers, if they ever met, would only exchange arrows and not ceremonial greetings.Footnote 81 The subsequent Jin assault on Qin in 578 BCE is presented as unrelated to the Jin-Chu peace agreement and as fully justifiable in light of Qin's anti-Jin machinations. It is Chu's attack on Zheng in 576 BCE that violates the covenant with Jin; Zuo zhuan repeatedly cites pronouncements of Chu and Jin dignitaries, who blame the Chu leadership for violating the peace and leading to the disastrous (for Chu) battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 in 575 BCE. Only at the depiction of the battle itself does the Zuo zhuan narration shift toward a more critical stance toward Jin: its success is presented as a Pyrrhic victory, leading soon to domestic turmoil. Xinian\u2019s interpretation of these events differs radically. The Jin assault against Qin is viewed as a violation of an agreement to establish \u201cuniversal\u201d peace; Chu's assault on Zheng appears as a retaliatory measure. Moreover, the Xinian authors are manipulative in their account: by dispelling with precise chronology after 578 BCE, they present all the events that spanned five years (Chu's attack on Zheng, Jin's retaliation, the Yanling battle, and the coup against Lord Li of Jin) as happening immediately one after another in the direct aftermath of Jin's anti-Qin aggression. The blame for the collapse of peace is placed squarely on Lord Li of Jin, whose violent death a year after the Yanling battle may be seen as divine retaliation for his perfidy. Chu was the victim; and while it was defeated militarily, the perpetrator, Lord Li, was punished by a humiliating death. There is no doubt that we have here two radically different interpretations of the same chain of events: the predominantly pro-Jin narrative of Zuo zhuan versus the unequivocally pro-Chu version of Xinian. Yet we should notice immediately that in terms of facts both narratives do not differ substantially (except for the precise content of the 579 covenant). And while each of the accounts is manipulative, neither appears to abandon the basic factual framework. This supports my earlier observation that the historical accounts of both Xinian and Zuo zhuan are fundamentally reliable\u2014minor embellishments, mistakes, and manipulations notwithstanding.Footnote 82 For the current discussion, suffice it to notice that while there are traits of pro-Chu sentiments in Xinian, in general this text contributes very little\u2014if at all\u2014to strengthening the Chu identity. Much like the anecdotes and Chu ju, Xinian remains overwhelmingly neutral in its depiction of Chu's past.\n\nRONGCHENGSHI The final text that I want to consider here is Rongchengshi \u5bb9\u6210\u6c0f, from the collection of Shanghai Museum. This relatively lengthy text of slightly over 2,000 characters presents the history of the Chinese world from the time of legendary thearchs down to the founding of the Zhou dynasty. The goal of this presentation is not purely historical: the narrative is built so as to convince the reader of the advantages of non-hereditary power transfer (ideally through the ruler's abdication in favor of a worthier candidate). Since the text had been translated and discussed twice,Footnote 83 I shall not address its complexity here but focus only on its Chu-related aspects. The Chu affiliation of Rongchengshi is not self-evident. While the manuscript was produced by a Chu scribe using Chu orthography, and was in all likelihood interred in the tomb of a Chu elite member, almost nothing in its content relates it to Chu. The only possible Chu trait is in the final phrase of the narrative about the creation of the Nine Provinces by Thearch Yu \u79b9 in the aftermath of the great flood. The narrative itself has no observable Chu connection, and the map of the Nine Provinces in Rongchengshi is markedly shifted to the north in comparison with its variants scattered through other texts, leaving Chu on the southern margins of the habitable world.Footnote 84 Yet the ending lines say: \u201cYu then created five hundred famous valleys to the south of the Han River and five hundred famous valleys to the north of the Han River\u201d.Footnote 85 This centrality of the Han River strongly suggests a Chu affiliation of the text's authors. However, as noted by Vera Dorofeeva-Lichtmann, it is also possible that the line was added by a Chu transmitter who wanted to make the text\u2014originally produced elsewhere\u2014more relevant to Chu.Footnote 86 Aside from this single line, no other aspect of Rongchengshi connects it with the state of Chu. I remain undecided regarding the origin of Rongchengshi: perhaps we should not consider it at all as a product of Chu historiography. However, insofar as the manuscript was looted from a Chu tomb, and insofar as it can be assumed that the text circulated in the state of Chu (and might have enjoyed sufficient prestige to merit interment in a tomb) it is justifiable to consider it in the framework of the present discussion. Two points should be raised here. First is the marked absence of identifiable Chu royal ancestors\u2014such as Zhuanxu, Zhurong, and the like\u2014from the lengthy list of legendary heroes discussed in the text. Second, the Rongchengshi narrative is markedly \u201ccenter-oriented,\u201d as it focuses exclusively on the monarchs who ruled the entire subcelestial realm. Regional lords, be they the kings of Chu or leaders of other polities, are simply ignored. The norm, as the authors repeatedly emphasize, is universal rule, attaining which represents the apex of the monarch's achievements. Thus, the text hails a primordial thearch whose reign preceded that of Thearch Yao \u582f: Superiors and inferiors, noble and mean\u2014each attained their [predestined] years. [The people] from beyond the four seas arrived as guests, and those from within the four seas were corrected. Birds and beasts came to court; fish and turtles submitted [tribute]; there was [smooth] communication between [localities with] abundant and deficient [resources]. \u4e0a\u4e0b\u8cb4\u8ce4\uff0c\u5404\u5f97\u5176\u4e16\u3002\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5916\u8cd3\uff0c\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5167\u8c9e\u3002\u79bd\u7378\u671d\uff0c\u9b5a\u9f08\u737b\uff0c\u6709\u7121\u901a\u3002Footnote 87 Elsewhere, the text hails the rule of Thearch Yu: He understood the distant from [inspecting] the near, eradicated quibbling and pursued simplicity; he relied on the people's desires, brought together the beneficent [matters of] Heaven and Earth, so that the near rejoiced in the orderly rule while the distant came on their own initiative. Everybody within and outside the four seas requested to submit tribute. \u4e43\u56e0\u8fe9\u4ee5\u77e5\u9060\uff0c\u53bb\u82db\u800c\u884c\u7c21\uff0c\u56e0\u6c11\u4e4b\u6b32\uff0c\u6703\u5929\u5730\u4e4b\u5229\uff0c\u592b\u662f\u4ee5\u8fd1\u8005\u6085\u6cbb\uff0c\u800c\u9060\u8005\u81ea\u81f3\u3002\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5167\u53ca\uff0c\u56db\u6d77\u4e4b\u5916\u7686\u8acb\u8ca2\u3002Footnote 88 Both passages emphasize the universality of the thearch's rule. In the first case the encompassing power of an unnamed thearch transcends the boundaries of humankind, reaching down to birds, beasts, fish, and turtles: all those strive to become the thearch's subjects.Footnote 89 In the second case unity remains confined to the realm of humans, but it is still comprehensive: all those from \u201cwithin and outside the four seas\u201d duly request to submit tribute. In both cases the entire subcelestial realm\u2014\u201cnear\u201d and \u201cdistant\u201d alike\u2014remains under the unified control. Regional polities appear in the text only when we enter the calamitous age of the last Shang tyrant, Zhouxin \u7d02\u8f9b (d. ca. 1046 BCE). Then, rebellions by regional lords and the danger of political disintegration appear as important symptoms of the overall deterioration that eventually justified the overthrow of the Shang. The Rongchengshi insistence that a politically unified world is the only normative situation may explain why Chu remains outside the narrative. In the unified universal realm independent or semi-independent regional lords (such as the king of Chu) are just an aberration. Accordingly, the multi-state system that stands at the center of Xinian and which was the norm for centuries prior to the composition of Rongchengshi is glossed over altogether. Under the rule of sage kings, regional states play no role, nor is there any meaning for regional identities. In the political vision of Rongchengshi there is simply no place for the state of Chu."}, {"url": "http://chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/rulers-chu.html", "page_content": "Nov 1, 2018 \u00a9 Ulrich Theobald\n\nDon't confound his regional state of the Zhou period with the empire of Chu \u695a (926-951), one of the Ten Kingdoms \u5341\u570b (902-979) of the Five Dynasties period \u4e94\u4ee3 (907-960).\n\nThe state of Chu \u695a was a regional state of the Zhou period \u5468 (11th cent.-221 BCE). It belonged to the larger polities that were able to survive until the end of the Warring States period \u6230\u570b (5th cent.-221 BCE). Chu is known for its culture that was significantly different from that of the states of the Central Plain. Chu was not among the states that were distributed as a regional states at the beginning of the Western Zhou period \u897f\u5468 (11th cent.-770 BCE). Its ruling dynasty was of a different origin than most of the regional dynasties of the Zhou empire. Another name of Chu is Jing \u834a. Chu was first located in the valley of the River Han \u6f22 and then moved southeast into the Yangtze Valley. During the Spring and Autumn period \u6625\u79cb (770 - 5th cent. BCE) it gradually expanded towards the north and east.\n\nMap 1. The regional state of Chu \u695a (11th cent. - 223 BCE) Map according to Tan Qixiang \u8c2d\u5176\u9aa7 (1987), Zhongguo lishi ditu ji \u4e2d\u56fd\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u96c6. Chu was located in the middle course of the Yangtze River and gradually expanded to the east and northeast. It played the role of temporary ally for the states of Qi and Qin, before the latter dominated over all regional states and founded the empire of Qin. Click to enlarge.\n\nThe semi-barbarian state of Chu becomes part of the middle kingdom\n\nThe ruling house of Chu derived its descendancy from the mythical Emperor Zhuan Xu \u9853\u980a, himself being a grandson of the Yellow Emperor \u9ec3\u5e1d. Zhuan Xu's great-grandson Zhong Li \u91cd\u9ece was the minister for fire (huo zheng \u706b\u6b63) of the mythical Emperor Di Ku \u5e1d\u56b3. For his merits earned in office, Zhong Li was bestowed the name of Zhu Rong \u795d\u878d. He was sent out to punish the rebellious lord of the waters, Gong Gong \u5171\u5de5, but Zhu Rong/Zhong Li was unable to kill Gong Gong. Enraged about this failure, Emperor Di Ku executed Zhong Li and had his brother Wu Hui \u5433\u56de take over the duties as minister of fire. Wu Hui had six grandsons that were called Kun Wu \u6606\u543e, Shen Hu \u53c3\u80e1, Peng Zu \u5f6d\u7956, Hui Ren \u6703\u4eba, Ji Lian \u5b63\u9023 and an unnamed son that was given the family name of Cao \u66f9. Five branches of the family fell into oblivion, except the descendants of Ji Lian who adopted the family name of Xiong \u718a or Mi \u7f8b (originally written \u5b2d).\n\nExcavated objects from the late Warring States period prove that the reigning dynasty of Chu also bore the family name Yan \u9153. Mi Xiong allegedly took part in King Wu's \u5468\u6b66\u738b conquest of the Shang empire \u5546 (17th-11th cent. BCE).\n\nIn the early decades of the Zhou period, King Cheng of Zhou \u5468\u6210\u738b (r. 1116-1079 BCE) made the family Mi regional rulers over the country of Chu in the middle Yangtze valley. From that time on they adopted the family name Mi, yet the rulers retained the surname Xiong. Xiong might also be a prefix of the personal name worn by all members of the family. In the late 11th century King Zhao of Zhou \u5468\u662d\u738b undertook several military campaigns against Chu during one of which he died, while his own army drowned in the River Han. The rulers of Chu called themselves \"king\" (wang \u738b) and therefore demonstrated that they were actually not part of the system of regional states of the Zhou empire.\n\nYu Xiong's great-grandson Xiong Yi \u718a\u7e79 settled near Mt. Jingshan \u834a\u5c71 (modern Nanzhang \u5357\u6f33, Hubei) and, after being appointed regional ruler (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) by King Cheng of Zhou, moved to Danyang \u4e39\u967d (modern Zigui \u79ed\u6b78, Hubei).\n\nViscount (zi \u5b50) Xiong Qu \u718a\u6e20 became aware that the house of Zhou was weakening and expanded his rule along the middle Yangtze valley up into the valley of River Han. He conquered the statelets of Yong \u5eb8 and Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5. He made his oldest song Wukang \u6bcb\u5eb7 king of Goutan \u53e5\u4eb6, his second son Zhihong \u646f\u7d05 king of E \u9102, and his youngest son Zhici \u57f7\u75b5 king of Yuezhang \u8d8a\u7ae0. Later on he feared that the king of Zhou would attack him because of the usurpation of the title of king and stripped his sons off their ranks as kings.\n\nAfter the death of Viscount Xiong Shuang \u718a\u971c his three sons indeed contended for the throne of Chu. The youngest son, Jixun \u5b63\u5f87 (Xiong Xun \u718a\u5f87), was finally able to occupy the throne. When Fen Mao \u86a1\u5192 (r. 758-741), also called Xiong Xun \u718a\u7734, died, his younger brother Xiong Tong \u718a\u901a assassinated the heir apparent and usurped the throne. He is posthumously called King Wu of Chu \u695a\u6b66\u738b (r. 741-690) because he carried out numerous military campaigns, like that against the statelet of Sui \u96a8, whose marquis, hoping to escape defeat, offered to Xiong Tong to travel to the court of the King of Zhou to reconfirm Xiong Tong in his royal position, but the King of Zhou declined. Enraged about the King of Zhou's refusal, Xiong Tong decided to adopt the title of king without the permission by the Son of Heaven, concluded an alliance with the marquis of Sui and occupied the territory of the hundred Pu tribes \u767e\u6fee south of the Yangtze River. Xiong Tong later suspected the marquis of Sui of treason and planned to occupy his territory, but he died en route to the battlefield.\n\nHis son Xiong Zi \u718a\u8cb2 mounted the throne. Zi is posthumously known as King Wen \u695a\u6587\u738b (r. 690-677). He was the first ruler of Chu who took residence in Ying \u90e2 (near modern Shashi \u6c99\u5e02, Hubei) instead of Danyang. Xiong Zi conquered several small states, like Xi \u606f (modern Xixian \u606f\u7e23\uff0c Henan), Shen \u7533 (modern Nanyang \u5357\u967d, Henan) and Deng \u9127 (modern Xiangfan \u8944\u6a0a, Hubei). His son Zhuang'ao \u838a\u6556 (ao was a kind of temple name, like the Chinese zong \u5b97), known as Xiong Jian \u718a\u56cf (also written \u718a\u8271), planned to kill his brother Xiong Yun \u718a\u60f2 (also written \u718a\u9835), but the latter escaped to Sui and gained sufficient support to usurp the throne of his brother. Xiong Yun is posthumously known as King Cheng \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 672-626). Unlike his predecessors, King Cheng was a peaceful ruler who sent appropriate tributes to the court of the king of Zhou, so that he was ordered to appease the barbarian tribes of the south instead of harassing the states in the Yellow River plain.\n\nIn 656 the hegemonial lord (ba \u9738) Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) attacked Chu, but King Cheng was able to urge his troops to stop and concluded a peace alliance (meng \u76df) in the conference of Zhaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan). In his later years King Cheng waged war against the statelets of Xu \u8a31, Xian \u5f26 (near modern Xixian, Henan), Huang \u9ec3 (modern Huanchuan \u6f62\u5ddd, Henan) and Ying \u82f1. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637), the new hegemonial lord, dispatched an envoy to Chu to offer a peaceful alliance, but the king refused and soon attacked Song \u5b8b and defeated the duke in the battle of Hong \u6cd3 (modern Zhecheng \u67d8\u57ce, Henan) and also the state of Zheng \u912d. Duke Xiang died from a wound received during the battle.\n\nIn 634 Duke Xi of Lu \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) arrived at the court of Chu and requested an army to punish the Duke of Qi \u9f4a. King Cheng sent out the Marquis of Shen \u7533 who conquered the territory of Gu \u7a40, where Duke Huan's son Yong \u96cd was instated as the local governor. The other sons of the Duke of Qi fled to Chu and were all made nobles in Chu. The statelet of Kui \u5914 was conquered, and then King Cheng attacked the state of Song. The Duke of Song requested support by the army of Jin \u6649. King Cheng thereupon withdrew because Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628), had been his exiled guest for a long time, and sent only out Ziyu \u5b50\u7389 with a small contingent that was defeated.\n\nAgainst the advice of Prime Minister (lingyin \u4ee4\u5c39) Zishang \u5b50\u4e0a, King Chen nominated his beloved son Shangchen \u5546\u81e3 heir apparent. Later on he deposed Shangchen in favour to Zhi \u8077. Shangchen thereupon arrested King Cheng and forced him to commit suicide. He mounted the throne, posthumously called King Mu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 626-614). His chief counsellor was Pan Chong \u6f58\u5d07. King Mu conquered the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f (modern Xixian, Henan) and Lu \u516d (a special reading, modern Lu'an \u516d\u5b89, Anhui) and attacked the state of Chen \u9673.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son L\u00fc \u4fb6, who is posthumously known as King Zhuang \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 614-591). King Zhuang did not attend the court, indulged in pleasures and even ordered to execute those who dared remonstrating against him. Wu Ju \u4f0d\u8209 thereupon used a riddle to admonish him, but without success. Only Su Cong \u8607\u5f9e was able to open the king's eyes so that he started caring for political matters again. During his campaign against the Rong barbarians \u620e of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e, King Zhuang visited the capital of the kings of Zhou in Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d (modern Luoyang, Henan) and was received by royal grandson Man \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff. The latter convinced him that the Heavenly Mandate (tianming \u5929\u547d) of the Zhou dynasty had not yet ended, in spite of the obvious weakness of the royal house.\n\nIn 597 Chu defeated the army of Jin near Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan). In 594 Chu besieged the capital of Song for five months and conquered the statelet of Yong \u5eb8 (near modern Zhushan \u7af9\u5c71, Hubei), later Shu-Liao \u8212\u84fc (modern Shucheng \u8212\u57ce, Anhui) and Xiao \u856d (near modern Xuzhou \u5f90\u5dde, Jiangsu).\n\nAfter the conquest of Chen, King Zhuang wanted to transform it into a district of Chu, but Shen Shu \u7533\u53d4 of Qi criticized the king, so that he reinstated the house of Chen. Yet his next step was to conquer the state of Zheng. After the lord of Zheng had begged for mercy, King Zhuang released him and created an alliance of peace. In 575 the army of Chu defeated the relieve army from Jin in the battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan). The rule of King Zhuang is seen as the apogee of the power of the state of Chu among the regional states of the Zhou period. He was accepted as hegemonial lord (ba \u9738).\n\nKing Zhuang was succeeded by his son Shen \u5be9, posthumously known as King Gong \u695a\u5171\u738b (r. 591-560). During his reign the army of Chu was defeated by Jin. The next ruler was King Gong's son Zhao \u62db, posthumously known as King Kang \u695a\u5eb7\u738b (r. 560-545). The latter was succeeded by his son Yuan \u54e1, who is also known as Jia'ao \u90df\u6556 (r. 545-541). King Kang had four younger brothers called Wei \u570d, Zibi \u5b50\u6bd4, Zixi \u5b50\u6673 and Qiji \u5f03\u75be. Wei was made Prime Minister and commander of the army. When Jia'ao fell ill, Wei entered the palace, strangulated the king and killed his sons Mo \u83ab and Pingxia \u5e73\u590f. Zibi fled to Jin, while Wei mounted the throne. He is posthumously known as King Ling \u695a\u9748\u738b (r. 541-529).\n\nChu as a major power of the Warring States\n\nKing Ling was able to assemble the regional rulers and to take over the lead as a factual hegemon of the regional states. Minister Wu Ju warned the king to become over-confident in his superior role, yet King Ling commanded the regional states in a campaign against the state of Wu \u5433. Qing Feng \u6176\u5c01, the commander of the troops of Wu, was kept prisoner, but dared criticizing King Ling for the way his fathers had come to the throne of Chu, and was therefore immediately executed by the king. He had the Zhanghua Terrace \u7ae0\u83ef\u81fa built where he received noble refugees from other states. Prince Qiji was ordered to attack the state of Chen, and King Ling invited the marquis of Cai \u8521 in order to poison him. Prince Qiji conquered the headless state of Cai and usurped the throne of the small marquisate.\n\nIn 530 BCE, King Ling attacked the small state of Xu \u5f90, located northwest of the state of Wu, and Lai \u8cf4 (modern Suizhou \u96a8\u5dde, Hubei). Chen was heavily deafeated and its dynasty brought to an end. At that moment, King Ling deliberated with his nobles whether he was strong enough to claim the same rights as the other regional rulers. Grand master (dafu \u5927\u592b) Xi Fu \u6790\u7236 answered that in old times, the state of Chu had been a very remote and less developed country, but now the King of Zhou would not refuse to bestow to the King of Chu bronze tripods as a symbol of royal power, and none of the other states would refuse to exchange gifts with the state of Chu.\n\nWhen King Ling was on campaign against Wu in the camp of Ganxi \u4e7e\u6eaa, the king of Wu was advised by Guan Cong \u89c0\u5f9e, a son of a noble of Cai whom King Ling had killed. The King of Wu joined a secret alliance with the state of Yue \u8d8a, whose nobleman Chang Shouguo \u5e38\u58fd\u904e had also been insulted by the king of Chu. Wu and Yue attacked Cai and won over Qiji, who was able to kill the heir apparent of Chu, Prince Lu \u797f. Zibi was enthroned as king of Chu, Zixi was made Prime Minister, and Qiji Minister of War (sima \u53f8\u99ac). Guan Cong thereupon travelled to the camp of King Ling and presented him with the facts of the rebellion at home. The army of Chu dispersed and left the king alone. King Ling wandered around in the wilderness and finally died of hunger because the new ruler had forbidden giving him anything to eat.\n\nThe new king, Zibi, was for a long time in an unclear state about the whereabouts of King Ling, and finally committed suicide, together with Zixi. Qiji renamed himself Xiong Ju \u718a\u5c45 and proclaimed himself king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Ping \u695a\u5e73\u738b (r. 527-516).\n\nIn fear of revenge, King Ping demonstrated a benevolent government towards the common people and restored the territories of the states of Chen and Cai, enthroning members of the former ruling houses. The eastern parts of Chu were plundered by the armies of Wu during this interlude of internal war in Chu.\n\nKing Ping decided to marry his son, Crown Prince Jian \u5efa, with a princess from Qin \u79e6. Yet the girl was so beautiful that the king decided to take her for himself, and she gave birth to Prince Zhen \u8eeb. Grand Tutor (taifu \u592a\u5085) Wu She \u4f0d\u5962 and Junior Tutor (shaofu \u5c11\u5085) Fei Wuji \u8cbb\u7121\u5fcc intrigued against each other and instigated in the king the fear that the crown prince might prematurely usurp the throne. Prince Jian thereupon fled to the court of Song. Wu She's son Wu Zixu \u4f0d\u5b50\u80e5, who was an excellent strategist, was able to escape to the state of Wu, the arch-enemy of Chu.\n\nThe mother of Prince Jian was captured by the army of Wu when Prince Guang \u5149 of Wu was campaigning against Chen and Cai. A small border clash in Beiliang \u5351\u6881 lead to an armed conflict between Chu and Wu, in which Wu conquered the territories of Zhongli \u9418\u96e2 and Juchao \u5c45\u5de2. King Ping was so threatened that he began fortifying the capital city Ying. When King Ping died, the nobles wanted to enthrone his younger brother Prince Zixi \u5b50\u897f, but he refused, so that the under-age prince Zhen was enthroned as ruler of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Zhao \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489).\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Prime Minister Zichang \u5b50\u5e38 took revenge for Prince Jian and Wu She and killed the intriguer Fei Wuji. The reason for this was that a many nobles had fled to Wu, where they supported the troops of Chu against the own dynasty in Chu. Yet there were also some princes of Wu escaping trouble in the own country at the court of Chu.\n\nIn 509 BCE the army of Chu, commanded by Prince Zichang, was heavily defeated by Wu in the battle of Baiju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). Wu Zixu as one of the competent military leaders of Wu even managed to conquer the capital of Chu in 506. As a revenge for the execution of his father, Wu Zixu had the tomb of King Ping desecrated. Commander Prince Zichang fled to the state of Zheng. King Zhao himself escaped to Yunmeng \u96f2\u5922 and then on to the former state of Sui, where he was hidden by his loyal courtiers and the population from the army of Wu.\n\nIn the meantime, minister Shen Baoxu \u7533\u9b91\u80e5 was sent to the state of Qin to ask for relief troops, which were indeed able to defeat the troops of Wu that had advanced far into the country of the enemy until they reached Ji \u7a37 (modern Tongbai \u6850\u67cf, Henan). Prince Fugai \u592b\u6982, brother of the king of Wu, usurped the throne on this occasion but was driven out by the righteous king and fled to the court of Chu.\n\nStill on his way back to the capital, King Zhao of Chu swallowed the state of Tang \u5510 (near modern Suizhou, Hubei), then Dun \u9813 (modern Shangshui \u5546\u6c34, Henan) and Hu \u80e1 (modern Fuyang \u961c\u967d, Anhui). There was another occasion in 504 when the army of Wu again invaded the state of Chu. Only with the death of King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad of Wu (r. 514-496) the attention of Wu was directed against the state of Yue, and the danger from the east was gone.\n\nOn his sickbed, King Zhao wanted to cede the throne to his younger brother, yet all nobles refused, before Prince Zil\u00fc \u5b50\u95ad conceded to become the successor of his brother. Yet when the King died on a campaign, the brothers decided to enthrone the king's son, Prince Zhang \u7ae0. He is posthumously known as King Hui \u695a\u60e0\u738b (r. 489-432). In 488 Prince Zixi invited the former Prince Jian's son Prince Sheng \u52dd to come back to Chu. He was granted the title of Duke Bai \u767d\u516c. Duke Bai planned to revenge his father's death, who had been killed in exile in Zheng.\n\nIn 481 BCE, the army of Jin attacked Zheng, and Zheng asked Chu for help. Instead of annihilating Zheng, commander Zixi left Zheng untouched. Duke Bai thereupon killed Zixi, Prince Ziqi \u5b50\u7da6 and Prime Minister Sima Ziqi \u53f8\u99ac\u5b50\u671f at the court and tried to kidnap King Hui. Yet the king was protected by his retainers and took refuge in the palace of the Queen Dowager of King Zhao.\n\nDuke Bai thereupon proclaimed himself king, but was assassinated by Prince Zigao \u5b50\u9ad8, called Duke Ye \u8449\u516c. In this year, Chu finally destroyed the state of Chen, in 447 the state of Cai, and in 445 the state of Qi \u675e.\n\nIn 473, the armies of Yue had finally destroyed the state of Wu. In the northern parts of Wu, along the plain of the River Huai \u6dee, Chu began to expand its territory. King Hui was succeeded by his son Prince Zhong \u4e2d, who is posthumously known was King Jian \u695a\u7c21\u738b (r. 432-408). Under his reign, Chu conquered the statelet of Ju \u8392 (modern Juxian \u8392\u7e23, Shandong) that had belonged to the territory of Qi. King Jian employed the famous military advisor Wu Qi \u5433\u8d77, who reformed the army, so that Chu was able to conquer the southern regions inhabited by the non-Chinese peoples of the Yangyue \u63da\u7cb5, namely the Dongting \u6d1e\u5ead (Hunan) and Cangwu \u84bc\u68a7 (Guizhou) regions.\n\nKing Jian was succeeded by his son Prince Dang \u7576, posthumously known as King Sheng \u695a\u8072\u738b (r. 408-402). King Sheng was killed by \"robbers\" (presumably nobles or family members) and was succeeded by his son Prince Yi \u7591, posthumously known as King Dao \u695a\u60bc\u738b (r. 402-381). Under his reign, Chu contended with the troops of the new states of Han \u97d3, Zhao \u8d99 and Wei \u9b4f, the successor states of Jin. King Dao was succeeded by his son Prince Zang \u81e7, posthumously known as King Su \u695a\u8085\u738b (r. 381-370). Because King Su had no sons, he left the throne to his younger brother Prince Liangfu \u826f\u592b, who is posthumously known as King Xuan \u695a\u5ba3\u738b (r. 370-340). At the end of the latter's reign, the armies of Qin attacked Chu. At that time, Qin was governed by counsellor Shang Yang \u5546\u9785.\n\nKing Xuan's son Prince Shang \u5546 succeeded to the throne in Chu, posthumously known as King Wei \u695a\u5a01\u738b (r. 340-329). He was able to defeat the armies of the state of Qi, which was at that time disturbed by inner quarrels. King Wei also defeated the armies of the kingdom of Yue and occupied a large part of its territory, so that Chu was now the sole state in the southern parts of China. In 306, Yue was destroyed by Chu.\n\nChu as a large but weak state between Qin and Qi\n\nWhen King Wei died, the state of Wei used this opportunity and conquered part of its northern territory. King Wei's successor was his son Prince Guai \u69d0, posthumously known as King Huai \u695a\u61f7\u738b (r. 329-299). In 323 BCE he took revenge and attacked the territory of Wei, seizing eight counties. The next military target was the state of Qi, yet at that time the military adviser Chen Zhen \u9673\u8eeb dwelled at the court of Qi and was dispatched to the camp of counsellor Zhao Yang \u662d\u967d, highest commander of the army of Chu. Chen Zhen persuaded Zhao Yang with the parable of drawing feet to a snake that he would have no advantage in defeating the army of Qi, so that Zhao Yang withdrew. At least, Chu was able to conclude an alliance with the states of Qin, Wei and Qi that was initiated by the famous diplomatist Zhang Yi \u5f35\u5100.\n\nThis alliance became important in 318 BCE, when an alliance, concluded with the help of Su Qin \u8607\u79e6, attacked the state of Qin. King Huai took over the lead of the allies and penetrated into the Hangu Pass \u51fd\u8c37\u95dc, yet the allies withdrew without forcing Qin to battle.\n\nIn 313, things had changed and Chu was in alliance with Qi. The king of Qin decided to send Zhang Yi to Chu in order to persuade King Huai to change side again and, in the end, to isolate Chu. Chen Zhen was well aware of this and warned King Huai, but he refused to accept the warning. In the end, the enraged king of Qi concluded an alliance with Qin. King Huai, on his side, made ready the troops for a campaign against Qin. Again, Chen Zhen warned the king and suggested offering Qin a city to restore the former alliance. King Huai ignored the warning, and so the army of Qin destroyed that of Chu at Danyang \u4e39\u967d in 312, captured a huge humber of troops and officers, and occupied the region of Hanzhong \u6f22\u4e2d. At Lantian \u85cd\u7530, the armies battled a second time, and the fresh defeat of Chu instigated Han and Wei to seize some more territory from Chu.\n\nA year later, Qin suggested concluding peace and sent Zhang Yi to the court of Chu. King Huai immediately arrested Zhang Yi and planned to kill him, but Zhang established contact with Jin Shang \u9773\u5c1a, who explained to King Huai that Qin would attack Chu again. He also spoke with the King's favourite, Lady Zheng Xiu \u912d\u8896, and threatened her that the king of Qin would try to purchase peace by sending beautiful girls to King Huai. The Lady then managed the release of Zhang Yi, and peace was made with Qin. Shortly after, the Chu embassador to Qi returned, Qu Yuan \u5c48\u539f, and reproached the king for not having executed Zhang Yi.\n\nIn 310 BCE, the King Min of Qi \u9f4a\u6e63\u738b (r. 324-284) sent an envoy to the court of Chu and explained that, after the death of King Hui in Qin, the situation had changed thoroughly, and suggested to conclude a common alliance with Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan \u71d5 against Qin. Zhao Ju \u662d\u96ce convinced King Huai that it was better to be part of the alliance around Qi and to win back the territory once lost to Qin. Yet in 307, King Huai decided that he could also win territory by concluding a peaceful alliance with Qin. Two years later Qin, Han and Wei attacked Chu for its betrayal of the alliance. King Huai sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qin and requested military support against the three states.\n\nIn 304, the crown prince of Chu had a private quarrel with some nobles of Qin. When he accidentally killed one of them, he fled and returned to Chu. In order to take revenge for the murder, Qin attacked Chu, supported by troops of Qi, Han and Wei, and defeated Chu at Chuisha \u5782\u6c99. A year later, Qin undertook a second campaign against Chu and heavily defeated the army of Chu. King Huai thereupon sent his crown prince as a hostage to Qi, an ally of Qin, and requested peace.\n\nOnly after a further campaign and after King Zhao of Qin had sent an urgent letter, King Huai of Chu consented to a meeting with the king of Qin at the Wuguan Pass \u6b66\u95dc. Yet King Huai did not trust Qin and feared that he might be caught in a trap. Zhao Ju suggested not to meet the king of Qin, but the King's younger son urged him to go. In the end, King Huai was escorted to Xianyang \u54b8\u967d, the capital of Qin, and was threatened to cease territory before concluding an alliance. He refused and was arrested and detained.\n\nAt home, the situation was precarious. Both the king and the crown prince were held hostages in Qin, and Zhao Ju argued that it was against etiquette to enthrone a younger son as long as the ruler was living. This meant that there was no head of government as long as King Huai was in Qin. The court brooded over the issue and finally invited Prince Heng \u6a6b to come to the capital Ying. He was enthroned as king of Ch, posthumously known as King Qingxiang \u695a\u9803\u8944\u738b (r. 299-263).\n\nThe king of Qin thereupon continued his campaigning against Chu, defeated its army, and seized territory in the north. A year later, King Huai managed to escape, but because the roads to Chu were blocked by Qin, he fled to the state of Zhao, but fearing the anger of Qin, King Huiwen of Zhao \u8d99\u60e0\u6587\u738b (r. 299-266) refused to offer protection. King Huai was finally captured by the bloodhounds of Qin and brought back to Xianyang, where he died a year later. At least, his corpse was allowed to be transferred back to his native state, where he was buried with greatest honours.\n\nIn 293 BCE, general Bai Qi \u767d\u8d77 massacred the army of Han. Threatened by this cruel way of warfare, King Qingxiang agreed to conclude a marriage of peace with Qin. This new alliance led to a campaign in 284, carried out by Qin, Chu, Han, Wei, Zhao and Yan and targeted against the state of Qi in the east. Chu so regained the region of Huaibei \u6dee\u5317. In 281, King Qingxiang was persuaded to resume war against Qin, in order to gain more territory. He first concluded an alliance with Qin and Han and planned to use this opportunity to conquer some territory of the patriarchal kings of Zhou around Luoyang. King Nan of Zhou \u5468\u738b\u8d67 (r. 315-256) thereupon sent his relative, Duke Wu \u6b66\u516c, to Zhaozi \u662d\u5b50, the counsellor of Chu. Duke Wu explained to Zhaozi that the destruction of the house of Zhou meant a thorough dissolution of the world order and would bring only chaos to the state of Chu. King Qingxiang thereupon abandoned this plan.\n\nThe campaigns against Qin continued, but in 278 BCE, general Bai Qi advanced to the capital of Chu and defiled the tombs of the kings of Chu. The capital of Chu was moved to the ancient site of Chen (modern Huaiyang \u6dee\u967d, Henan) It was only in 276 that the army of Chu was able to recover some of its core territory. Chu was even able to supporte Han, Zhao and Wei in a campaign against Yan. This was only possible because of an armistice bargained with Qin, covered by the crown prince as a hostage dwelling in Qin.\n\nWhen King Qingxiang fell ill, his son Prince Xiong Yuan \u718a\u5143 (or Wan \u5b8c) managed to escape from Qin and was enthroned as the new king of Chu. He is posthumously known as King Kaolie \u695a\u8003\u70c8\u738b (r. 263-238). The new king immediately appointed his trusted Counsellor-to-the-Left (zuoxi \u5de6\u5f92), Lord Chunshen \u6625\u7533\u541b, as Prime Minister. Under the Lord's administration, the state of Chu was able to recover for a while. The capital was first shifted to Juyang \u5de8\u967d (modern Taihe \u592a\u548c, Anhui), later to to Shouchun \u58fd\u6625 (modern Shouxian \u58fd\u7e23, Anhui) further to the east. Lord Chunshen met with Lord Xinling \u4fe1\u9675\u541b of Wei and forged an alliance that was able to defeat Qin in 257. A year later, Chu conquered the state of Lu.\n\nKing Kaolie was succeeded by his son Prince Dao \u608d (or Yu \u715c), who is posthumously known as King You \u695a\u5e7d\u738b (r. 238-228). Li Yuan \u674e\u5712, a powerful noble, used this personal change to assassinate Lord Chunshen. King You was succeeded by his younger half-brother You \u7336 (or Hao \u90dd), who is posthumously known as King Ai \u695a\u54c0\u738b (r. 228). He only ruled for two months before he was overthrown and killed by his older half-brother Fuchu \u8ca0\u82bb (r. 228-223).\n\nThe rule of the last kings of Chu was overshadowed by a growing military success of the state of Qin that succeedingly conquered the states of Han, Zhao and Wei. In 224, the Qin general Wang Jian \u738b\u7fe6 defeated the army of Chu and killed general Xiang Yan \u9805\u71d5, a great uncle of Xiang Yu \u9805\u7fbd, the eventual hegemonial king (bawang \u9738\u738b) of West Chu \u897f\u695a. A year later, Wang Jian and Meng Wu \u8499\u6b66 seized the capital of Chu, captured King Fuchu and transformed the state of Chu into a commandery of the state of Qin.\n\nThe name of Chu was often used as a name for imperial princedoms, and was one of the Ten States (Shiguo \u5341\u570b) in the 10th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.

It is characterized by a significant decrease of political power of the kings of Zhou which had to flee to the eastern capital Chengzhou \u6210\u5468 (or Luoyi \u96d2\u9091, modern Luoyang \u6d1b\u967d, Henan) after their western and main capital Zongzhou \u5b97\u5468 (of Feng \u8c50, near modern Xi'an \u897f\u5b89, Shaanxi) had been attacked by the nomad tribes of the Quanrong \u72ac\u620e.\n\nPeriodization\n\nThe name of the historical period is derived from the chronicle of the regional state of Lu \u9b6f called Chunqiu \u6625\u79cb \"Spring and Autumn Annals\" because the seasons are always mentioned in the entries. The Annals cover the time from 722 to 481 BCE, yet the historical period is traditionally counted from the reign of King Ping of Zhou \u5468\u5e73\u738b (r. 770-720 BCE), who restored the Zhou dynasty in Luoyang, down to the division of the state of Jin \u6649 by the regional rulers (zhuhou \u8af8\u4faf) of Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f and Zhao \u8d99 in 376. Alternatively, the end of the Spring and Autumn period can be seen as 453, when the three viscounts (zi \u5b50) of Han, Wei and Zhao extinguished all other lateral lines to the house of Jin, or 403, when King Weilie of Zhou \u5468\u5a01\u70c8\u738b (r. 426-402) bestowed upon the viscounts of Han, Wei and Zhao the title of marquis (hou \u4faf).\n\nThe second great historiographical writing of the Spring and Autumn period is the collection Guoyu \u570b\u8a9e \"Discourses of the states\" that includes anecdotes of the states of Zhou \u5468, Lu \u9b6f, Qi \u9f4a, Jin \u6649, Zheng \u912d, Chu \u695a, Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a. Said to be a composition of Zuo Qiuming \u5de6\u4e18\u660e, its oldest parts must have been compiled at the end of the 5th century BCE.\n\nConfucius\n\nThe most important intellectual person of this historical period was the philosopher Confucius (Kongzi \u5b54\u5b50; ca. 551-479) who tried to revive the ideal of the human and righteous rulers of old. Although his ideas seemed lost in a time of political realism his thoughts about state and society (\"Confucianism\") were to become the fundamental doctrine of imperial China.\n\nThe Early Decades of the Eastern Zhou and the Duke of Zheng\n\nThe eastern capital Chengzhou (Luoyang) did not provide the kings of Zhou with sufficient power. They were therefore dependent on the powerful regional rulers, especially those of Qin \u79e6, Jin, Qi and Chu. These are called the \"local rulers\" (fang bo \u65b9\u4f2f) because they practically ruled independently from the king of Zhou, and not any more as his vassals. It became common that the regional states acted on their own behalf regarding territory and military feuds, without asking the king of Zhou for formal permission. Duke Zhuang of Zheng \u912d\u838a\u516c (r. 743-701) even dared attacking King Huan \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 720-697 BCE) who had not treated him properly according to the ritual regulations. Heijian \u9ed1\u80a9, the Duke of Zhou \u5468\u516c, even planned to kill King Huan's successor, King Zhuang \u5468\u838a\u738b (r. 697-682), and to replace him with Prince Ke \u514b. Yet Xin Bo \u8f9b\u4f2f warned the king and saved his life.\n\nDuke Zhuang of Zheng defeated intruding Rong \u620e tribes and swallowed the neighbouring state of Xu \u8a31. In 707 King Huan of Zhou \u5468\u6853\u738b (r. 719-697) started a punitive expedition against the Duke, but the king was defeated. From then on, the kings of Zhou never again tried to intervene into the politics of their own regional rulers. They stayed in their small royal domain around Luoyang and had to be content with the tributes of the regional rulers that were presented less and less regularly. Besides Zheng, the states of Song \u5b8b and Lu \u9b6f demonstrated their military and political power in the Central Plain.\n\nThe Rise of Duke Huan of Qi\n\nKing Li \u5468\u91d0\u738b (r. 682-677) was so helpless against the new threats endangering the empire that he allowed Duke Huan of Qi \u9f4a\u6853\u516c (r. 685-643) to adopt the title of hegemonial lord (ba \u9738, or bo \u4f2f). In this function the Duke defended the regional states against raids of barbarian tribes and cared for law and order among the states of the Middle Kingdom, with the motto \"support the king and ward off the barbarians\" (zun wang rang yi \u5c0a\u738b\u6518\u5937).\n\nIn the east, the state of Qi had rich natural ressources and became one of the mightiest regional states of the Eastern Zhou period.\n\nDuke Huan of Qi employed the legalist statesman Guan Zhong \u7ba1\u4ef2 as his adviser who reorganized administration and the military and financial systems. Through these reforms Qi was able to subdue Song and Lu and even the hegemonial state of Zheng. At that time, the non-Chinese nomad tribes of the Rong and Di \u72c4 undertook raids on the soil of Chinese states and devastated the states of Xing \u90a2 and Wei \u885b (modern Shanxi and Hebei). Duke Huan of Qi rescued the dynastic houses of these states and settled them down more to the south. The system of the hegemon thus developed to a kind of lord protector of a strong state over weaker ones, and Qi promised to protect the states in the Central Plain against further intrusions of the northern nomad warriors.\n\nThe Semi-Barbarian Kingdom of Chu\n\nIn the south, the state of Chu on the middle Yangtze River had become politically stronger than before. King Cheng of Chu \u695a\u6210\u738b (r. 671-626) started to challenge the hegemony of Qi and swallowed smaller states in his neighbourhood. Nonetheless, subservient states like Jiang \u6c5f and Huang \u9ec3 changed side and declared their alliance with Qi. Chu thereupon attacked Zheng. Duke Huan assembled the regional rulers and created an alliance with Lu, Song, Chen and Wei to punish Chu in 656 by devastating the state of Cai \u8521, an ally of Chu. Chu gave in, and the ambassadors of the two mighty states met at Shaoling \u53ec\u9675 (modern Yancheng \u90fe\u57ce, Henan) to conclude a peaceful alliance (meng \u76df).\n\nThe System of Hegemonial Lordship\n\nIn 651 Qi organized a meeting at Kuiqiu \u8475\u4e18 (modern Lankao \u862d\u8003, Henan) whith the representatives of Lu, Song, Zheng and Wei, and in presence of a royal diplomat from Zhou. The members of the meeting decided that states creating a friendly alliance should never attack each other, and that they had to assist each other in case that one partner was attacked. The Duke of Qi thus became the overlord over the weaker states of Zhou China and replaced the king of Zhou as the highest judicial person.\n\nSuccession Crises at the Zhou Court\n\nWhen King Li died a succession crisis endangered the house of Zhou. His righteous heir was Prince Kan \u95ac, who is known as King Hui \u5468\u60e0\u738b (r. 677-652), but his late grandfather, King Zhuang, had had a favourite son called Prince Tui \u7a68. King Hui was not a very intelligent ruler. He offended many of his highest ministers and caused a rebellion that forced him to flee to Wen \u6eab (modern Wenxian \u6eab\u7e23, Henan) and then to Li \u6adf, a town in the state of Zheng. His uncle Prince Tui was made King of Zhou, but he did not prove a better ruler. He was therefore attacked and killed by the lords of Zheng and Guo \u8662. King Hui returned to the throne.\n\nWhen King Hui died he was succeeded by his son Prince Zheng \u912d, who is known as King Xiang \u5468\u8944\u738b (r. 652-619). King Xiang had a half-brother called Shudai \u53d4\u5e36 (or Dai \u5e36), who had been the favourite son of King Hui. Prince Shudai planned to usurp the throne and joined forces with the Rong and Di \u7fdf tribes. The plot failed and Prince Shudai fled to Qi. It was a high minister of Qi, the reformer Guan Zhong, who mediated the peace treaty between the house of Zhou and the Rong tribes. A decade later the king of Zhou even allowed Prince Shudai to return.\n\nWhen the state of Zheng attacked in 639 the statelet of Hua \u6ed1, whose lords were relatives to the house of Zhou, King Xiang sent You Sun \u6e38\u5b6b and Bo Fu \u4f2f\u670d as diplomats to negotiate peace. Yet the Duke of Zheng arrested the diplomats. The King thereupon ordered the Di tribes to attack Zheng, inspite of the remonstances of minister Fu Chen \u5bcc\u8fb0. Fu Chen was also not content with the King's will to marry a Di princess in order to reward the Di chieftain for his support. His critics were justified because only a few years later King Xiang discarded the \"barbarian\" queen, which caused an attack of the Di on the royal capital, during which the Earl of Tan \u8b5a (or the earls of Yuan \u539f and Mao \u6bdb) was/were killed. Fu Chen thereupon threw himself into battle against the intruders and died. King Xiang fled to Zheng and was received by the duke of Zheng, in spite of all former discrepancies.\n\nIn the meantime Prince Dai was enthroned as King of Zhou, yet he took residence in Wen, not in Luoyang. He invited the Di queen to return to the royal domain. Two years later King Xiang asked the duke of Jin for help, who willingly attacked the usurper and executed him. King Xiang, returning to the throne, rewarded Duke Wen of Jin \u6649\u6587\u516c (r. 636-628) with the title of hegemonial lord and presented him with some territory. Duke Wen was thereafter the most powerful political leader of the Middle Kingdom and assembled the regional rulers, including his formal superior, the King of Zhou, at Heyang \u6cb3\u967d and Jiantu \u8e10\u571f. The kings of Zhou were now wholly dependent from support by other political actors. Histories nevertheless concealed this shameful situation with terms like \"royal hunt at Heyang\".\n\nThe Rise of the Regional State of Jin\n\nAfter the death of Duke Huan of Qi several regional rulers strove for overlordship. Duke Xiang of Song \u5b8b\u8944\u516c (r. 650-637) was defeated by Chu, and the state of Song lost its last chance to rise to political and military significance. Instead, the state of Jin rose to supremacy in old China: Duke Xian of Jin \u6649\u737b\u516c (r. 676-651) had already extended the power of his state by swallowing the statelets of Geng \u803f, Huo \u970d, Wei \u9b4f (a state that was later one of the three destructors of Jin), Guo \u8662 and Yu \u865e. After a decade of inner struggles, the state of Qin supported Duke Wen of Jin in his ascension to the throne of Jin.\n\nJust as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin employed political advisors, Zhao Shuai \u8d99\u8870 (Zhao Chengzi \u8d99\u6210\u5b50) and Hu Yan \u72d0\u5043, who strengthened the \"national\" economy and so the military power of the state. In 635 the King Xiang of Zhou escaped from inner disturbances to the state of Zheng. Duke Wen of Jin saw his chance, rescued the king and accompanied him back to the royal domain, for which support he was highly rewarded by the King.\n\nThe next step for the Duke was to challenge the power of the southern, semi-Chinese state of Chu that had dominated the Central Plain since the death of Duke Huan of Qi. In 632 the two states clashed at the battle of Chengpu \u57ce\u6fee (modern Zhencheng \u7504\u57ce, Shandong), and Chu was defeated. Duke Wen of Jin established a new friendly alliance during the meeting at Jiantu \u8e10\u571f (modern Yingze \u6ece\u6fa4, Henan) with the seven most important states. In the same year, at Wen, the King of Zhou sanctified the hegemony by Jin. Duke Wen's successor Duke Xiang \u6649\u8944\u516c (r. 627-621) was able to prolong the hegemonial prevalence of the state of Jin.\n\nConflict Between Qin and Jin\n\nDuring the reign of Duke Xiang of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin \u79e6\u7a46\u516c (r. 659-621) opened a long period of military confrontation between Jin and Qin, but Qin seldomly won any battle. The powerful state of Jin blocked the gate to the Central Plain, and Qin could not but expand its territory to the west into the territory of the Western Rong tribes \u897f\u620e and establish good relations with Chu in the south. Chu meanwhile further expanded its territory by conquering the statelets of Jiang \u6c5f, Lu \u516d (a special reading!), and Liao \u84fc. After the death of Duke Xiang of Jin, the noble Zhao Dun \u8d99\u76fe (Zhao Xuanzi \u8d99\u5ba3\u5b50) dominated the throne succession of Jin, murdered Duke Ling \u6649\u9748\u516c (r. 620-607) and enthroned Duke Cheng \u6649\u6210\u516c (r. 606-600). During this period Jin lost its initiative in \"foreign\" politics. The political advisor Fan Shan \u8303\u5c71 proposed to King Mu of Chu \u695a\u7a46\u738b (r. 625-614) to take the chance and to advance against the north.\n\nThe Rise of the State of Chu\n\nKing Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) had to resolve internal quarrels and uprisings of aboriginal tribes before he was able to reform economic and military administration and to resume this expansion politics. In 606 the southern king sent out an envoy to the court of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 606-586) to express his will to swallow the royal domain of Zhou. In 598 King Zhuang of Chu crushed the small state of Chen \u9673, one year later the state of Zheng. At the battle of Bi \u90b2 (near modern Zhengzhou \u912d\u5dde, Henan) the army of the hegemonial state of Jin was defeated.\n\nA few years later, Chu defeated the state of Song and finally obtained the overlordship over the Central Plain. The protecting task of the overlord had gradually lost its original intention and became a system of hegemony of one major state over weak satellites of Chinese and \"barbarian\" origin. The attitude to help small states during internal quarrels and against \"barbarian\" invaders changed to a regular intervention into political affairs to the advantage of the great states.\n\nInternal Quarrels in Jin\n\nThe state of Qi observed the growing power of Chu, declared a friendly relationship with the southern king of Chu, who was the only regional ruler who called himself king, except, of course, the King of Zhou. Qi repeatedly attacked the smaller states of Lu and Wei which therefore asked for support the former hegemonial state of Jin. In 589, the army of Jin fought with Qi in the battle of An \u978d (modern Jinan \u6fdf\u5357, Shandong) and once again demonstrated its superior military power. Chu instantly declared war to Jin, but neither Chu nor Jin dared to initiate a concrete campaign.\n\nAfter long years of hesitation and negotiations (under the stipulation of Jin's political advisor Song Huayuan \u5b8b\u83ef\u5143) Chu attacked Zheng and Wei in 576. One year later the armies of the two hegemonial states fought in the famous battle of Yanling \u9122\u9675 (modern Yanling, Henan) in which Jin prevailed by a narrow margin. Duke Li of Jin \u6649\u53b2\u516c (r. 580-573) saw his chance to resume hegemony, murdered his mightiest noblemen Xi Zhi \u90e4\u81f3, Xi Qi \u90e4\u9321 and Xi Chou \u90e4\u72a8 (the \"Three Xi\" \u4e09\u90e4). Yet instead of having strengthened his own position, Duke Li faced serious opposition by the Jin aristocracy like Luan Shu \u6b12\u66f8 and Xun Yan \u8340\u5043 who eventually killed their lord.\n\nUnder the next ruler, Duke Dao \u6649\u60bc\u516c (r. 572-558), the internal situation calmed down, and the duke was able to strengthen the position of the state of Jin. His political advisor Wei Jiang \u9b4f\u7d73 proposed to appease the nomad warriors of the Rong with financial tributes instead of fighting them. In 571 Jin erected a fortification wall at Hulao \u864e\u7262 (modern Fanshui \u6c3e\u6c34, Henan) against the state of Zheng that was backed by Chu.\n\nAfter more than two decades of relative peace the political advisor Song Xiangxu \u5b8b\u5411\u620c proposed to organize a peace conference to end military conflict. It was held in the capital of Jin in 546 and the participating fourteeen states decided to accept the overlordship of the two states of Jin and Chu. Their adherents had to declare their subjection under the respective overlordship and to present tributes to the two hegemons. Among the participating states, there would be ten years of peace, and for more than fourty years, Jin and Chu would not meet at the battle field again.\n\nOnly two of the larger states did not participate in the general peace: Qi, and Qin.\n\nThe old kingdom of Zhou had totally lost its political role. The tributes once paid to the kings of Zhou were now offered to the dukes of Jin and the kings of Chu. If a small state did not pay tribute it had to expect military sanctions. Especially precarious was the role of the state of Lu that had to maintain good relationships to the three states of Jin, Chu and Qi, if it did not want to be swallowed by one of them. Very similar was the role of Zheng that was directly in the line of fire between Jin and Chu. But states like Lu also imitated the overlordship of their own masters and demanded tributes from yet smaller states like Teng \u6ed5, Qi \u675e or Zeng \u912b.\n\nThe Rise of the Semi-Barbarian States of Wu and Yue\n\nDuring the relatively peaceful sixth century, the two southern non-Chinese coastal states of Wu \u5433 and Yue \u8d8a emerged as new powers. Jin saw its chance to open a second flank against Chu, and in 583 Duke Wuchen of Shen \u7533\u516c\u5deb\u81e3 was sent to Wu in order to seek a military alliance. The semi-barbarian state of Wu was equipped with military tools and Wu soldiers were trained to attack Chu. But it was only more than half a century later that Wu became a serious threat to Chu after swallowing the statelet of Xu \u5f90.\n\nUnder King Hel\u00fc \u95d4\u95ad (r. 514-496) the political advisor Wu Yuan \u4f0d\u54e1 proposed to raise three armies that clockwise were to skirmish at the borders of Chu to weaken this state. In 506 the whole army of Wu finally attacked Chu and defeated this state at Baiju or Boju \u67cf\u8209 (modern Macheng \u9ebb\u57ce, Hubei). In pursuit of the escaping enemy, the army of Wu advanced to the capital of Chu, Yingdu \u90e2\u90fd (modern Jiangling \u6c5f\u9675, Hebei). King Zhao of Chu \u695a\u662d\u738b (r. 516-489) had to take his flight and sought for help in Qin. This western state sent out chariots that expelled the invaders from Wu.\n\nWu's neighbour Yue took the advantage of the prolonged campaigns against Chu to invade Wu. In 496, Wu set its troops into march to carry out a punitive expedition against Yue, but King Hel\u00fc died in the battle of Zuili \u6a87\u674e (modern Jiaxing \u5609\u8208, Zhejiang). Two years later, King Fucha \u592b\u5dee of Wu (r. 495-473) defeated Yue during the revenge battle of Fujiao \u592b\u6912 (modern Suzhou \u8607\u5dde, Jiangsu). Goujian \u53e5\u8e10, king of Yue (r. 496-465), fled to Mount Guiji \u6703\u7a3d\u5c71 (south of modern Shaoxing \u7d39\u8208, Zhejiang).\n\nAlthough Fucha's advisor Wu Yuan proposed to destroy the state of Yue, the king of Wu was content with his success in battle and the destruction of the capital of Yue. After the defeat of Chu and Yue, King Fucha turned his attention to the north. He had a fortification wall built at Han \u9097 (near modern Yangzhou \u63da\u5dde, Jiangsu) and dug out canals (see Grand Canal) that connected the Yangtze River with the Huai River \u6dee\u6c34 valley, creating a traffic line to the north and the possibility to move troops faster. The small states of Lu and Zhu \u90be declared themselves subjects to Wu. In the years 485 and 484 Wu attacked several times the state of Qi by land and by river and finally defeated Qi in the battle of Ailing \u827e\u9675 (modern Laiwu \u840a\u856a, Shandong). Wu assembled the states of the Central Plain to a meeting at Huangchi \u9ec3\u6c60 (modern Fengqiu \u5c01\u4e18, Henan), with the intention to declare its hegemony. Jin, weakened by internal struggles, did not dare to challenge the new powerful state of Wu, and King Fucha became the new hegemon.\n\nJust during the conference of Huangchi, King Goujian of Yue took the chance and invaded the capital of Wu. The overstretched military power of the state of Wu was unable to withstand the southern opponent who had rebuilt its strength after the defeat of Guiji. In 473, Yue destroyed the state of Wu and replaced it as the dominating power of the southeast. King Goujian of Yue was the last of the so-called Five Hegemons (Wuba \u4e94\u9738).\n\nThe Five Hegemons are also called the \"Five Earls\" (Wubo \u4e94\u4f2f). Different literary sources and commentaries identify them with different persons. The traditional definition by Zhao Qi \u8d99\u5c90 defines them as Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, Duke Mu of Qin, Duke Xiang of Song, and King Zhuang of Chu. The book Xunzi \u8340\u5b50 identifies them with Duke Huan of Qi, Duke Wen of Jin, King Zhuang of Chu, King Hel\u00fc of Wu and King Goujian of Yue.\n\nThe Disintegration of the Old Order of Regional States\n\nIn the mid-5th century BCE there were four states that dominated old China: Chu in the south, Yue in the southwest, Jin in the north, and Qi in the east. Yet things were to change soon: Inner conflicts toppled two of the reigning houses (Jin and Qi), new powers emerged (Wei \u9b4f, Zhao \u8d99 and Han \u97d3), and reforms in the administration of several states created a new type of \"modernized\" regional state: the centralized state with a strengthened \"national\" economy and a professional army. The administration of the state by nobles related to the ruling house was replaced by a bureaucratic officialdom.\n\nThe state Lu was the first that felt the power of noble families which challenged the ducal house, in this case the Three Huan (Sanhuan \u4e09\u6853, descendants of Duke Huan \u9b6f\u6853\u516c) the Jisun \u5b63\u5b6b, Mengsun \u5b5f\u5b6b (Zhongsun \u4ef2\u5b6b) and Shusun \u53d4\u5b6b. From the time of Duke Xi \u9b6f\u50d6\u516c (r. 659-627) on these three noble families dominated the state of Lu. Duke Zhao \u9b6f\u662d\u516c (r. 541-510) even had to escape from their intrigues and died abroad. At the beginning of the fifth century minor nobles like Nan Kuai \u5357\u84af, Yang Hu \u967d\u864e and Hou Fan \u4faf\u72af rebelled against the mighty families and took over the rule of Lu.\n\nDescendants of the dukes of Song fought for the domination within the small state: the families Hua \u83ef, Yue \u6a02, Lao \u8001, Huang \u7687 (descendants of Duke Dai \u5b8b\u6234\u516c, r. 799-766), Yu \u9b5a, Dang \u8569, Lin \u9c57 and Xiang \u5411 (descendants of Duke Huan \u5b8b\u6853\u516c, r. 681-651). In the permanent power struggles only the families Yue and Huang survived the Spring and Autumn period.\n\nThe seven descendant lineages of Duke Mu of Zheng \u912d\u7a46\u516c (r. 627-606) also gradually lost their power in the course of the Spring and Autum period.\n\nIn the state of Qi, the government was led by the lineages of Guo \u570b, Gao \u9ad8, Cui \u5d14 and Qing \u6176. In this state it was a family not related to the ducal house that took over power in Qi: the family Tian \u7530, descendants of a prince from Chen, Tian Jingzhong \u7530\u656c\u4ef2, who had come to Qi in 672 while escaping internal disturbances in Chen. Under Duke Jing \u9f4a\u666f\u516c (r. 547-490), Jingzhong's descendant Tian Qi \u7530\u4e5e was ennobled and from this position collected wealth and power enough to annihilate the families Guo and Gao. His son Tian Chang \u7530\u5e38 was already wealthier than the Duke himself and sent his ambassadors to the neighbouring states. His descendants would eventually replace the reigning house in Qi.\n\nThe most tremendous power challenge from within took place in the state of Jin where descendants of the ducal line were not invested as regional governors (dafu \u5927\u592b). But this measure did not prevent other noble families from trying to dominate the court of Jin: Hu \u72d0, Zhao \u8d99, Xian \u5148, Xi \u90e4 and Xu \u80e5 were the dominating noble clans of the middle Spring and Autumn period, and were later replaced by the families Han \u97d3, Wei \u9b4f, Luan \u6b12, Fan \u8303 and Xun \u8340. At the beginning of the 5th century the noble families of Zhao, Wei, Han, Fan, Zhonghang \u4e2d\u884c and Zhi \u667a survived the internal struggle. The three first could destroy the last three and dissolved the dukedom of Jin, dividing its territory among themselves.\n\nDuring the reign of King Ding of Zhou \u5468\u5b9a\u738b (r. 607-586), the southern ruler King Zhuang of Chu \u695a\u838a\u738b (r. 613-591) advanced his armies as far as the valley of River Luo in the pursuit of the Rong tribes of Luhun \u9678\u6e3e. The king of Chu used this situation pay the king of Zhou a visit, but King Ding only sent Prince Man \u6eff (\"Royal Grandson Man\" \u738b\u5b6b\u6eff) to confer with the semi-barbarian king of Chu. They talked about the so-called \"nine tripods\" (jiuding \u4e5d\u9f0e) erected in the capital that symbolized the nine regions of the kingdom of Zhou.\n\nAfter the death of King Ling of Zhou \u5468\u9748\u738b (r. 572-545) and during the reign of King Jing \u5468\u666f\u738b (r. 545-521) a succession crisis beset the house of Zhou. The heir apparent, Prince Sheng \u8056, had died prematurely. King Jing preferred his oldest son Prince Chao \u671d, yet when the king died, Prince Gai \u4e10 was supported by a strong party among the courtiers. The highest ministers enthroned Prince Meng \u731b, who was immediately attacked and killed by the adherents of Prince Chao. Prince Meng is posthumously known as King Dao \u5468\u60bc\u738b (r. 521-520). Prince Chao proclaimed himself king of Zhou, yet Prince Gai on his side asked for support by the duke of Jin and finally made it to the throne. He is known as King Jing \u5468\u656c\u738b (r. 520-476). Prince Chao, who had reigned for four years, fled to Chu. In 504, when he had assembled a sufficient number of supporters, he attacked King Jing and forced him to flee to Jin. A year later Duke Ding of Jin \u6649\u5b9a\u516c (r. 512-475) helped King Jing back on the throne."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/King-Zhuang-of-Chu", "page_content": "King Zhuang of Chu (Chinese: \u695a\u838a\u738b; pinyin: Ch\u01d4 Zhu\u0101ng W\u00e1ng, died 591 BC) was a monarch of the Zhou Dynasty State of Chu during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient Chinese. His personal name was Xiong L\u00fc, ancestral name Mi (\u8288), and King Zhuang was his posthumous title. He became one of the Five Hegemons and attempted to wrest control of China from the king of Zhou.\n\nKing Zhuang ascended the throne in 613 BC at a time when the Kingdom of Chu was in disarray. For the first three years of his reign, Zhuang wasted time on excessive hunting and lavish partying. Several courtiers were anxious about the king but none dared speak up as he had given orders that anyone who challenged his authority would be killed. When a particularly senior minister challenged him through a riddle, the king responded that he had been waiting for three years for someone from his court to show some nationalistic pride.\n\nThe king made Sunshu Ao chancellor and began a series of reforms. Chu's agricultural output improved significantly during his reign, aided by Sunshu Ao's comprehensive dam-works and an enormous planned reservoir created in modern-day northern Anhui province. In 611 BC he annexed the State of Yong (\u5eb8\u56fd), a move which made Chu much stronger.\n\nAfter some overwhelming victories at the head of his army, King Zhuang attempted to take the place of King Ding of Zhou. He asked a messenger from Zhou about the weight of the Nine Tripod Cauldrons which Zhou possessed, a euphemism for seeking ultimate power in China at the time but was rebuffed.\n\nIn the Battle of Bi, his army defeated the State of Jin, another strong state at that time. Later he achieved hegemony amongst some other states. His progress from lazy regent to a hegemon of his time gave rise to the Chinese Four-character idiom of y\u012b m\u01d0ng j\u012bng r\u00e9n (Chinese: \u4e00\u55da\u9a5a\u4eba; literally: \"Amaze [the others] with one cry\")."}, {"url": "https://www.visiontimes.com/2021/07/12/a-forgiving-nature-is-always-rewarded.html", "page_content": "King Zhuang of Chu (\u695a\u838a\u738b) was one of the Five Hegemons of the Spring and Autumn Period (\u6625\u79cb\u4e94\u9738, 770-476 B.C.), and the most accomplished monarch of Chu.\n\nAt a celebration after the suppression of a rebellion, King Zhuang and his ministers drank to their heart\u2019s content. King Zhuang had his concubine Xu Ji toast the ministers. In the evening, he ordered the court to light candles, and the singing and dancing continued.\n\nSuddenly a gust of wind blew out the candles. In the darkness, one of the drunken courtiers pulled on Xu Ji\u2019s clothing. In those days, no men were allowed in the palace unless they were castrated. Assaulting a concubine in this way was a serious offence. She pulled the tassel off of the courtier\u2019s hat and asked King Zhuang to deal with him. King Zhuang not only did not do anything about it but also said loudly that everyone should take their tassels off, relax and enjoy. After all the ministers had taken off their tassels, King Zhuang ordered the candles to be relit.\n\nXu Ji was both surprised and angry. When the banquet was over, she complained to the king. He replied, \u201cIt is excusable to be careless after drinking. If I were to condemn a minister to death over something like this, it would chill the hearts of other ministers, and they would not be able to do their best to defend the country.\u201d Nodding, Xu Ji listened, and agreed.\n\nThe minister was undoubtedly at fault for his drunken demeanor, but King Zhuang showed breadth of mind in the way he handled the incident. In time, he was repaid for his kindness.\n\nWhen King Zhuang was leading his troops to attack the state of Zheng, he was ambushed, and in a critical situation. Tang Cui, the vice general of the Chu army, single-handedly rushed into the enemy lines and rescued King Zhuang from the chaos. The King of Chu was very grateful and wanted to reward him. Then Tang Cui told him that he was the one who had pulled on Xu Ji\u2019s clothes at \u201cthe feast of the tassels.\u201d\n\nLater on, the story of \u201cthe Feast of the Tassels (\u7d55\u7e93\u4e4b\u5bb4 Ju\u00e9 y\u012bng zh\u012b y\u00e0n)\u201d was used as an allusion to treating people with generosity.\n\nTolerance does not mean giving up one\u2019s dignity; tolerance is the use of wisdom and virtue to treat others kindly."}]}
