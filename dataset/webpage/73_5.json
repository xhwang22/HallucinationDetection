The imprint has a varied history that spans from classical music to popular music, but it\u2019s impact on all music is undeniable. This short history of Decca Records is by no means the whole story, but it should give you an insight as to why Decca remains revered to this day.\n\nThe story of Decca Records begins with a man named Edward Lewis in 1928. It was in that year that the directors of Barnett Samuel And Sons felt their run as a family business, stretching back to 1832, was likely over. The company, established by Henry and Josiah Solomon in Sheffield, had expanded from its original business of manufacturing tortoise shell doorknobs, knife handles, and combs to making and selling musical instruments. In 1861, Henry\u2019s Polish-born brother-in-law, Barnett Samuel, bought the musical-instrument side of the business, which he quickly expanded, with the help of his son, Nelson, and nephew, Max. Barnett Samuel And Sons Ltd was incorporated in 1900, by which time the firm was well established as one of Britain\u2019s leading musical instrument wholesalers.\n\nListen to the best of Decca Records on Spotify.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cManufacturing gramophones but not records was like making razors but not blades\u201d\n\nAround the time that World War I broke out, Barnett Samuel issued its latest innovation \u2013 the Decca Dulcephone, a revolutionary portable gramophone player. Before long, Barnett Samuel was the biggest record wholesaler and dealer in London. Thinking that sales of gramophone records had peaked, the surviving Samuel cousins who now ran the company decided the time was ripe to cash in. They floated the company on the London Stock Exchange and quit the board.\n\nThe stockbroker who oversaw the flotation was an ambitious 28-year-old named Edward Lewis. The newly public company was incorporated as the Decca Gramophone Company, and made an early splash; Decca\u2019s initial share issue was oversubscribed 20 times over. As yet, though, Lewis remained unmoved.\n\n\u201cI took little notice at the time,\u201d Lewis famously noted later. \u201cAnd remember remarking that a company manufacturing gramophones but not records was rather like one making razors but not the consumable blades.\u201d\n\nIn August that year, however, Lewis got wind that the Duophone Company, who manufactured the \u201cunbreakable record,\u201d was in dire straits. He suggested that Decca buy out Duophone, who had recently taken over British Brunswick Ltd (Brunswick issued their US counterpart\u2019s records \u2013 including those by Al Jolson). But when Decca decided against the plan, Lewis decided to take matters into his own hands, forming Malden Holding Company Ltd to take over the Duophone factory in Kingston, near London. Lewis decided to also take over the Decca Gramophone Company, and, to this end, Malden, with JA Balfour as managing director, incorporated a new company \u2013 the Decca Record Company Ltd.\n\nThe acquisition, they worked out, would cost something in the region of \u00a3660,000. With working capital needed of around a further quarter of a million pounds, Lewis and Balfour knew they needed to raise a cool \u00a3900,000. But, as Lewis recalled, \u201cFor safety\u2019s sake and also because it seemed easier to raise a million than nine hundred thousand, we decided to make the [share] issue the larger figure.\u201d\n\nThe new company soon acquired an illustrious board, chaired by Sir George Fowler, chief magistrate for Kingston Upon Thames. Sir Sigismund Mendl and Sir Stanley Machin joined as directors. (In Mendl\u2019s case, the decision was between Decca and Smith\u2019s Crisps, but he was put off the latter by his wife, who thought there was no market for ready-fried potato chips: \u201cDon\u2019t be so silly, your servants do that sort of thing.\u201d)\n\nLaunching Decca Records\n\nThe Decca Record Company began trading on February 28, 1929. In those early days, the business of making high-fidelity recordings was in its infancy. At Decca\u2019s studios at the Chenil Galleries on London\u2019s King\u2019s Road, performances were captured by a single microphone, concealed from the musicians by a screen showing rural scenes. But just as the fledgling record company was beginning to get off the ground, the Wall Street stock market crash of 1929 hit hard. \u201cEvery attempt was made to conserve resources,\u201d said Lewis, \u201cbut as the turnover was totally inadequate the end seemed inevitable unless drastic changes took place.\u201d\n\nLewis joined the board and put forward the proposal to reduce the price of Decca\u2019s records in order to gain market share from competitors HMV and Columbia. When these two merged to form EMI in 1931, Decca took advantage by undercutting their prices.\n\nWith a policy of acquiring talent with a mass appeal, Lewis led Decca through stormy waters in the 30s, boasting on adverts that the label had \u201cLeading artists \u2013 lower prices.\u201d Though a deal with German company Polyphonwerk gave Decca access to a sizable classical catalogue, its focus remained on the popular market \u2013 the coveted bandleader Jack Hylton was a big signing.\n\nAmerican Decca\n\nLewis leapt upon instability within the record business to secure the UK rights to the American Brunswick label \u2013 a deal that brought to Decca such big-name US acts as Al Jolson, Cab Calloway, The Mills Brothers, The Boswell Sisters and Bing Crosby. To its US catalogue, Decca added an impressively diverse homegrown roster including George Formby, The Band Of The Grenadier Guards and Charles Hall \u2013 \u201cthe musical saw minstrel.\u201d\n\nSwinging On A Star\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nEver conscious of the need to expand, Lewis set about establishing a business footing in the US. When partnership deals proved difficult to secure, he simply elected to set up an American Decca company by himself. The new company quickly established itself on similar principles to the UK version. But at the same time as the economic instability brought on by the Wall Street crash began to fade, a new danger appeared on the horizon, in the shape of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe war effort\n\nWith war pending, Lewis opted to sell his shares in American Decca, focusing purely on the UK label. In 1939, the newly independent American Decca accounted for over one third of all records sold in the US and was soon pressing some 135,000 discs per day. With artists including The Andrews Sisters, Bing Crosby and Billie Holliday, the American label would exit the war years as a hugely successful and established company. It would go on to become part of one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, after it acquired Universal-International in 1952, before becoming part of MCA in 1962, and, eventually, part of the Universal Music Group.\n\nLover Man\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nBack in Britain, the decade-old label was now running profitably, with not-insignificant assets dotted across London \u2013 studios in West Hampstead, a New Malden pressing plant, and offices on Brixton Road, close to The Oval cricket ground. The war years would bring fresh challenges \u2013 Lewis lost his house to a parachute bomb, while the offices and factory also took direct hits from the Luftwaffe. Ever the innovator, Decca got around restrictions on shellac supplies (records were made from shellac at this point) by offering customers a discount on new purchases if they returned unwanted old records, which could then be recycled.\n\nA series of Music While You Work 10\u201d releases was deployed in factories and offices to raise morale for the war effort, while links with Britain\u2019s allies opened up new sources of classical music from the USSR, and a fantastic roster of artists under the Brunswick imprint, which included Fred Astaire, Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, Duke Ellington and The Ink Spots.\n\nJubilee Stomp\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nThe company also made an unexpected contribution to the war effort. Harvey Schwartz headed up Decca\u2019s radio and television engineering efforts in London. He and Lewis pioneered the development of a system known as The Navigator, which used radio signals for navigation purposes. The Admiralty eventually deployed the Navigator as a means for locating and clearing mines ahead of the D-Day landings. Decca\u2019s excellent research and development teams contributed a number of other technological weapons, which led to the West Hampstead studios maintaining an armed guard.\n\nPioneering recording technology\n\nIn return, the war effort\u2019s need to record and cut unusually high frequencies onto records, in order to help train crews to identify enemy U-boats, pushed the boundaries of what could be reproduced on record. This led to advances in high-fidelity record production that would have otherwise taken years to develop. Recording engineer Arthur Haddy recognized how this new technology could benefit the recording and disc-cutting process. Full Frequency Range Recording (FFRR) was put into commercial use for the first time in 1944.\n\nThe post-war years would be a boom time for Decca. After the war, Lewis created the Decca Navigator Company Ltd, boasting the world\u2019s most accurate and reliable navigation system; by the 70s, some 30,000 ships and 8,000 aircraft were using the system. The launch, in 1947, of the Decola radiogram continued the initial company\u2019s tradition of innovating with home listening equipment, with its lightweight pick-up and elliptical stylus offering superb sound in people\u2019s homes \u2013 albeit only after shelling out a whopping \u00a3200-plus. Nonetheless, Decca Records was fast becoming synonymous with high-fidelity sound recording and reproduction.\n\nThe late 40s and early 50s saw remarkable developments in the record business, not least the introduction in 1948 of long-playing 33 1/3rpm vinyl discs, which replaced the standard 78rpm shellac records. Coupling such long-playing technology with its innovative FFRR technology, the Decca Sound was established as a byword for quality records.\n\nAdvances, too, were being made by Haddy in the field of multi-channel recording, as well as experimenting with more and more microphones, used in unusual formations. A young engineer named Roy Wallace created a system for using a variety of microphones bolted onto a t-shape, resulting in what Haddy described as looking \u201clike a bloody Christmas tree.\u201d This \u201ctree\u201d configuration was then put through a two-channel input mixer, creating what Haddy dubbed \u201cBinaural\u201d sound. By the late 50s, Decca had rolled out Full Frequency Stereophonic Sound (FFSS), and, with John Culshaw now heading up the technical advances, Haddy and his engineers led the way in improvements to the recording process at Decca. Quieter, multi-track tape machines were supported by Dolby Noise Reduction systems. These great-sounding techniques were largely reserved for the classical audience, and Decca Records has remained a market leader in the classical world ever since.\n\nAt the forefront of popular music\n\nBy the mid-50s, a different kind of revolution was happening in the popular-music market, and, again, Decca was at the forefront. It boasted a catalogue of labels that specialized in pop music, including London, RCA, Brunswick, and Coral.\n\nIts Brunswick label scored a smash hit in 1954 with \u201cRock Around The Clock\u201d by Bill Haley & His Comets. The advent of rock\u2019n\u2019roll changed the record industry forever, seeing sales of records to a teenaged audience rocket over the coming decades. Decca Records quickly snapped up Tommy Steele, Britain\u2019s top rock\u2019n\u2019roller, who went to No.1 with his version of \u201cSinging The Blues,\u201d and then Lonnie Donegan, whose \u201cRock Island Line\u201d was a Top 10 hit in 1956.\n\n[We're Gonna] Rock Around The Clock\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nDonegan was a jazz musician who spearheaded the skiffle craze that was sweeping Britain. Skiffle combined elements of jazz and blues but could be played on homemade instruments, such as tea-chest bass and washboard. The skiffle craze saw hundreds of new bands spring up around Britain, the long-term effect of which would come to the fore with the explosion of British beat groups in 1963-64, almost all of whom got their first experience of playing in a group thanks to skiffle.\n\nBut while many of these youngsters loved to play skiffle, their real passion was rock\u2019n\u2019roll. And though homegrown acts like Tommy Steele and Billy Fury offered a chance to see the stars in the flesh, it was always to America that teenagers looked. Decca\u2019s London American label had the cream of the crop, licensed from America\u2019s finest independent labels like Chess, Sun, Specialty, and Tamla. It was Decca Records and its subsidiaries that introduced Britain\u2019s future stars to Chuck Berry, Johnny Cash, Eddie Cochran, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Bo Diddley.\n\nThe label that rejected The Beatles\u2026\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day 1962, a former skiffle group from Liverpool famously auditioned for Decca. That Decca turned down The Beatles after that audition has gone down in pop folklore, but they weren\u2019t alone. Pretty much every record company in the UK \u2013 including EMI, where they would ultimately find fame \u2013 did likewise. At the time, Decca had a choice between The Beatles and Brian Poole And The Tremeloes, choosing the latter at least in part due to them coming from London, and therefore making life easier all round. Besides, the industrial north was still considered essentially a cultural wasteland in England at that time, so A&R man Dick Rowe\u2019s decision not to sign the pre-Ringo Beatles was hardly against the tide.\n\nThree Cool Cats (Anthology 1 Version)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAs the 60s dawned, the pop market was in a state of flux. As a result of a number of problems (many of them behavioral), rock\u2019n\u2019roll was on the wane, and the music market was becoming increasingly hard to predict. And then in late 1962, Decca struck gold. Produced by the maverick Joe Meek in his studio above a luggage shop on London\u2019s Holloway Road, \u201cTelstar\u201d was a blast from the future, an instrumental inspired by the space race, replete with otherworldly sounds created by Meek in his experimental homemade studio. The Tornados took it to the top of the UK charts. But things didn\u2019t end there. So successful was the single that it not only topped the UK chart but also hit No.1 in the US, something previously only ever achieved twice by a UK act (and only then as one-hit wonders). Soon, the British beat boom that was the maturing of Britain\u2019s skiffle craze would smash the US \u2013 and global \u2013 market wide open.\n\n\u2026 eventually signed The Rolling Stones\n\nAlongside EMI, Decca was the biggest record company in the UK. But with the signing of The Beatles, and, in their wake, other Merseybeat acts such as Cilla Black and Gerry And The Pacemakers, EMI looked like it would dominate the pop market. If a Mersey act wasn\u2019t topping the charts, then EMI\u2019s other top seller, Cliff Richard And The Shadows, was scoring the hits. Ironically, it would be thanks to The Beatles that Decca fought back, after George Harrison recommended that Decca\u2019s Mike Smith sign a local band called The Rolling Stones. And as if that wasn\u2019t enough, Lennon and McCartney donated a song to the London rhythm\u2019n\u2019blues band, with \u201cI Wanna Be Your Man\u201d going to No.12 in the UK charts and kickstarting the Stones\u2019 career.\n\nI Wanna Be Your Man ((Original Single Mono Version))\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nWhile the Brit groups were amassing their invasion force, Decca\u2019s London American imprint continued to keep the UK supplied with Stateside smashes, including those from the stable of \u201cthe American Joe Meek\u201d, Phil Spector, including \u201cBe My Baby,\u201d by The Ronettes and \u201cDa Do Ron Ron\u201d by The Crystals.\n\nMeanwhile, Decca Records continued to vie with EMI for the cream of the homegrown crop, harvesting Rod Stewart, Steve Marriott, Lulu, Tom Jones, Joe Cocker, The Moody Blues and Van Morrison\u2019s Them. This was truly a golden age for both Decca and the pop world at large, with discs flying off the shelves in an endless whirl. As soon as one record\u2019s lifespan started to decrease, an even more brilliant offering took the airwaves \u2013 and record stores \u2013 by storm.\n\nEnriching music\n\nOf course, the record-buying public wasn\u2019t yet completely dominated by youngsters, and Decca could still notch up considerable success with the likes of The Bachelors, Jim Reeves or Val Doonican, while The Sound Of Music soundtrack album topped the UK album charts for an unprecedented 70 weeks in total between 1965 and \u201968. It would become the second-best-selling album of the entire decade. And as The Beatles hit new heights with their \u201cStrawberry Fields Forever\u201d/\u201dPenny Lane\u201d single, Decca\u2019s Englebert Humperdink kept them off the top spot with \u201cRelease Me.\u201d\n\nBut for the large part, the story of Decca \u2013 and, indeed, the record industry as a whole \u2013 in the 60s was of a transatlantic competitiveness that enriched the music (and coffers) of all involved. Brunswick launched The Who and Decca brought out Small Faces. In return, their licensing business scored great success with The Righteous Brothers and The Byrds, before latching onto the American R&B market with acts like Otis Redding and James Brown.\n\nKeeping up with the times\n\nTo keep up with the changing times, Decca Records launched its progressive Deram label in 1966 to showcase pop recordings made using \u201cDeramic Sound\u201d (Decca Panoramic Sound), which afforded engineers to create a more dynamic stereo field, placing individual instruments in their own space within the stereo picture. Acts broken by the label include David Bowie (Decca released his debut album), Cat Stevens, The Move, and Procol Harum. The Moody Blues, Amen Corner, and The Flowerpot Men enjoyed success on the label, but by the mid-70s, Deram was used less and less.\n\nDavid Bowie - Space Oddity\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nAs the sun set on the 60s, the landscape had altered immeasurably from that which had dawned with such innocence. Artists and labels were at loggerheads \u2013 Decca and The Rolling Stones had a famous stand-off over the cover of the latter\u2019s 1968 Beggars Banquet album (the Stones had chosen artwork of a graffiti\u2019d public lavatory). The Stones and Decca parted ways with the dawn of the new decade.\n\nHaving let both David Bowie and Genesis slip through their fingers, Decca nevertheless still scored huge successes with The Moody Blues, Caravan, Ten Years After and Brotherhood Of Man. Its long-trusted classical and easy-listening sectors, however, were fabulously buoyant, while the label\u2019s budget World Of\u2026 series kept Decca Records\u2019 stock on the high street, introducing a new generation to the wonders of its enviable back catalogue.\n\nNights In White Satin (Full Version)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nThe 60s and 70s brought with them the rise of a new kind of record label, with new independents such as Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin and Chris Blackwell\u2019s Island able to offer the sort of kinship with experimental young artists that larger organizations couldn\u2019t match. In 1979, a full half-century after creating the company, Edward Lewis sold Decca lock, stock and barrel to Dutch conglomerate PolyGram. Almost immediately after he\u2019d completed the final transfer of the company, Lewis died, on 29 January 1980, at the age of 79.\n\nThe Siemens-backed new owner began to offload assets piecemeal \u2013 beginning with Navigator, that World War II system that had been deployed ahead of D-Day. Next went the pressing plant in New Malden and the studios in West Hampstead.\n\nDominating classical music\n\nBut while Decca largely ceased to exist as a pop label by the end of the 80s (after enjoying hits with Bananarama, Bronski Beat, The Communards and Fine Young Cannibals), as a classical label it continued to flourish \u2013 and break new ground. It was in the unlikely form of the BBC\u2019s theme tune to its coverage of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy that opened up the huge classical crossover audience.\n\nHaving chosen for its opening credits Decca\u2019s recording of Luciano Pavarotti singing an aria from Puccini\u2019s Turandot, the tenor\u2019s remarkable performance was matched by England\u2019s football team on the field. \u201cNessun Dorma\u201d became synonymous with the rebirth of English football after two troubled decades, and, as such, brought opera to the masses. When Decca\u2019s recording of that tournament\u2019s opening concert performance by The Three Tenors (Pavarotti, Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras) was released, it went on to become the biggest-selling classical album of all time, paving the way for classical crossover artists from Russell Watson to Andrea Bocelli.\n\nPuccini: Turandot - Nessun Dorma!\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nDecca dominated this market \u2013 and continues to do so. To their already illustrious roster \u2013 including Katherine Jenkins, Nicola Benedetti and Alfie Boe \u2013 in 2018 they added the fastest-rising classical star in recent memory, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, securing him a worldwide stage with performances at the high-profile wedding between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, and ensuring crossover appeal with covers of Bob Marley\u2019s \u201cNo Woman, No Cry\u201d and Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s now 90 years since Edward Lewis put records and gramophones together to create the Decca Company. The Samuel cousins couldn\u2019t have been more wrong that record sales had peaked. Sometimes it takes a visionary prepared to take a punt on gut instinct to create something remarkable. Edward Lewis did just that.\n\nDecca: The Supreme Record Company: The Story Of Decca Records 1929-2019 can be bought here."}, {"url": "https://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/resources/detail/407", "page_content": "Decca Introduction\n\nThe Decca Labels: A Discography - compiled by Michel Ruppli.\n\nThe Decca label first originated in England. The Decca Record Company, created in 1929, acquired the rights for material recorded in the United States under the Brunswick and ARC labels. Jack Kapp, one of Brunswick's executives, attempted a collaboration between Brunswick and English Decca. He left Brunswick in 1934 and, with financial support from England, formed the U.S. branch of Decca. The U.S. Decca label was born.\n\nKapp took with him such Brunswick artists as Bing Crosby and the Mills Brothers and started recordings for the new label. Even in the beginning, the fields covered were as varied as popular music, jazz, blues, and rural music (including what we call country music and blues today).\n\nIn 1935, Decca purchased the Champion trademark and part of the Gennett material, including some sessions originally recorded by Paramount. Some of these recordings were reissued on the Champion and Decca labels.\n\nRecording activity grew over the years, using studios in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. Decca soon became one of the major U.S. recording labels, joining RCA Victor and Columbia. During World War II, the Petrillo recording ban in 1942-1943 reduced activity, but Decca purchased a number of transcriptions recorded by the World label. (The World material was later sold to the Circle label of New Orleans.) After the war, a new peak of activity occurred. Decca purchased material from the Signature label and started reissuing vintage material from\n\nBrunswick, using a revised Brunswick logo. At the same time, the subsidiary Coral was started for newly recorded material in the pop field. Vocation, another subsidiary label, was created and used as a budget label for reissues.\n\nIn the meantime, Jack Kapp, who had headed the label since the beginning, resigned to form his own company and produce recordings under the Kapp label (not included in this set).\n\nAnother change, concerning country recordings, occurred after the war. In the late 1930s, field recordings resulted from yearly trips to cities in the South (El Paso, San Antonio, Charlotte, New Orleans, Dallas, Houston, among others). In 1945 recording began in Nashville, which was to become one of the greatest recording sites for the next 30 years. Many sessions took place in Owen Bradley's various studios and a great many Nashville recordings were made for Decca (and are collected in Volume 5 of this set).\n\nIn 1969, Decca was purchased by the MCA Communication Group, but continued to operate as before. In 1970, the Brunswick label was sold to Nat Tarnopol, who also headed Dakar Records of Chicago. (Later recordings on that label do not belong to the Decca era.) The deal also included the Brunswick masters recorded by Decca after 1967, which do not belong to MCA. However, these recordings were originally assigned Decca master numbers and, consequently are listed in the present set.\n\nIn early 1973, the name Decca was deleted, and all recordings, new and reissues, were issued on the MCA logo. (From 1969 on, Decca records were issued in the U.K. using the MCA label.)\n\nAmong the great popular artists recorded by Decca is Bing Crosby, who built most of his career on that label and was with Decca the best-selling artist of all time. Hoagy Carmichael, Dick Haymes, Deanna Durbin, Judy Garland, Al Jolson, Danny Kaye, and Peggy Lee were also recorded on that label. The following vocal groups also had big hits: The Mills Brothers, The Andrews Sisters, The Ink Spots, The Four Aces, and later, The Merry Macs and The Ames Brothers.\n\nDance bands on Decca included Guy Lombardo, Jan Garber, and Russ Morgan, and the more jazzy bands included the Casa Loma Orchestra, Jimmy Dorsey, Bob Crosby, and Tommy Dorsey.\n\nJazz artists and orchestras were a big part of the recordings over the years. The jazz section was directed during those years by Milt Gabler (who started in the business by heading the Commodore Music Shop and later his own Commodore recording label). Major jazz artists Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Lionel Hampton, Fletcher Henderson, Art Tatum, the young Nat King Cole and his Trio, Les Brown, Woody Herman, Louis Jordan, and Jimmy Lunceford recorded extensively for Decca. The Decca catalogue also includes reissues of the Brunswick recordings of the young Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway.\n\nIn the blues field, Kokomo Arnold, Amos Easton (Bumble Bee Slim), Peetie Wheatstraw, and Roosevelt Sykes were among the veterans on Decca. Later, many artists who recorded for the \"race\" series were backed by the house rhythm section, led by pianist Sam Price (Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Mary Knight, among others).\n\nMahalia Jackson started recording with Decca, and the catalogue also included various religious groups (such as the Five Blind Boys of Alabama and the Harmonizing Four).\n\nDuring Decca's peak of activity, numerous recordings were made for children, many using the voice of Frank Luther.\n\nMany postwar recordings were in the country and rock fields. In the 1950s, several major rock stars appeared on Decca, among them Bill Haley, Brenda Lee, and Buddy Holly. In the country field, Decca recorded the pioneers (The Sons of the Pioneers, Milton Brown, the Carter Family, and Bob Wills). A thorough history of prewar country recordings, The Decca Hillbilly Discography, 1927-1945 by Cary Ginell (1989), was previously published in Greenwood's Discography Series and was used as a reference for the present set. In subsequent years, major recording artists included Ernest Tubb, Bill Monroe, Burl Ives, Kitty Wells, Patsy Cline, Webb Pierce, Loretta Lynn, among others.\n\nAnother important branch at Decca was the Classical Division, which produced records by great artists Jascha Heifetz, Sylvia Marlowe, and Andres Segovia) and orchestras (Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and New York Pro Musica). A large part of the Classical catalogue came from distribution of the German Deutsche Grammophon label, including recordings by Dietrick Fischer-Dieskau, Wilhelm Kempff, and David Oistrakh. The catalogue also included many popular reissues from foreign labels (mostly European), among which were English Decca and Deutsche Grammophon.\n\nThis overview exemplifies the richness of the Decca label that resulted from the many fields covered and the nearly 40 years in which Decca operated."}, {"url": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/when-decca-records-were-part-of-everyday-life/", "page_content": "In 1929 in America, Dashiell Hammett published his debut hardboiled novel Red Harvest, over in Paris Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed began showing their film Un Chien Andalou at a small cinema, while in Britain the fledgling Decca Record Company opened for business.\n\nIssued to mark 90 years of the label\u2019s existence, this large format, fully illustrated volume benefits greatly from access to its extensive archive of the days when Billie Holiday, Kathleen Ferrier, Tom Jones, Pavarotti, Bing Crosby, Buddy Holly, Herbert von Karajan, Billy Fury, Marianne Faithfull, George Formby, Slaughter & the Dogs, Georg Solti, Benny Hill, Winston Churchill and even the Playboy Club Bunnies appeared on Decca or its subsidiaries.\n\nMost popular Brendan O\u2019Neill Prince Harry the Tyrannical\n\nDecca\u2019s history is inextricably bound up with that of its founding director, Sir Edward Lewis, who persuaded a successful gramophone manufacturer of that name to move into the record business. Shares in the new company began trading in February 1929, and that they survived the subsequent Depression and went on to establish a formidable artist roster in the 1930s was in no small part due to Lewis\u2019s abilities and perseverance. In January 1980, weeks before his death, he sold the company to the Dutch conglomerate PolyGram, after which its historic studio in West Hampstead was closed and its pressing plant and head office building disposed of. Although the Decca name has since been retained through several corporate buyouts, some might argue that the real story ended with Sir Edward.\n\nThe editors have assembled some fine writers to contribute individual sections exploring the label\u2019s varied output. Michael Gray provides fascinating details on the origin of Decca\u2019s industry-leading full frequency range recording process, developed during wartime to track U-boats; while Lois Wilson is equally good at telling the story of the US Decca offshoot, which scored many hits with artists such as Louis Jordan and Bill Haley.\n\nJon Savage covers the glory years of 1950s and 1960s British pop in fine form, when the Rolling Stones, Them and the Who cut timeless albums for the label. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that when discussing Joe Meek\u2019s unique 1962 composition and production, \u2018Telstar\u2019 by The Tornados, reaching No. 1 in America, he says only two British acts had ever achieved that position before \u2014 Laurie London in 1958 and Acker Bilk in 1962. In fact, someone got there ahead of them in 1952, becoming the first foreign artist to top the Billboard charts. It was Vera Lynn, with the million-selling \u2018Auf Wiederseh\u2019n Sweetheart\u2019, released by Decca, the label she\u2019d been with since 1937, and for whom, aged 102, she wrote a foreword to this book.\n\nThis is a very good-looking production, a sumptuous and substantial LP-sized coffee table book, although it is questionable whether the average reader desperately needed five pictures devoted to the 1978 novelty act Father Abraham & the Smurfs. Nevertheless, the clear reproduction of large quantities of vintage press clippings preserved by the company\u2019s publicists is very welcome. \u2018Text \u00a9 Decca Records\u2019 reads the verso page, and it is certainly the story as they wish it to be told.\n\nThat said, there is much to enjoy here, always allowing for the inevitable shifts of mood between sections. Those who appreciate the very good accounts of the technical challenges of recording opera in the immediate post-war era may not want in-depth examinations of the rock and pop catalogue, and vice versa. However, perhaps the book\u2019s main value is as a survey of the sheer range of activities of one of the key players in the industry.\n\nThroughout the volume there is a compulsive tendency to name-drop David Bowie. Yes, Decca\u2019s subsidiary, Deram, released various singles and his Anthony Newley-obsessed debut LP in 1967 \u2014 and swiftly dropped him when they didn\u2019t sell \u2014 but he also recorded for Pye and Parlophone, finally scoring a hit for Phillips in 1969 before his lengthy run of classics for RCA. Despite appearing here on 14 different pages scattered across the book, his sole hit for the label was the 1973 post-Ziggy cash-in reissue of the 1967 comedy single \u2018The Laughing Gnome\u2019.\n\nThe best things in life are free (for a month) Unlock a month\u2019s worth of unlimited online and app access by subscribing today for free.

Davis had recently been fired from his VP position at Columbia\u2019s Okeh Records for moonlighting. According to Davis, he was eager to get Chandler a signing advance of $50k in order to receive a management cut of $10k (20%) which he needed fast to remove a mob contract put on the life of his partner, Irv Nahan. Nahan was in the crosshairs of a booking agent named Milt Shaw who believed that Nahan\u2019s new booking agency (Queens Booking Agency), which Nahan owned with Davis, Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield, was going to steal The Drifters from the Shaw Booking Agency since Nahan already managed the Drifters.\n\nAfter learning of Nahan\u2019s predicament, Davis reached out to one of Wilson\u2019s managers to intervene. During an intense \u201csit down\u201d in a dimly lit back room of a Brooklyn NY tavern, a visibly terrified Nahan assured the parties involved that he would not interfere with Shaw\u2019s deal with The Drifters. The hit men assigned to eliminate Nahan agreed to spare his life on the condition that Nahan and Davis make good on the $10k promised to them by Shaw to do the job. When Nahan and Davis could not come up with the cash, Wilson\u2019s manager directed them to Brunswick as a potential source of funding. Both Davis and Nahan were very relieved when Tarnopol agreed to sign Chandler and pay the $50K advance.\n\nThe unusual circumstances that brought Tarnopol and Davis together would soon have much greater ramifications than the signing of Gene Chandler. Tarnopol saw the value in Davis\u2019 production ability and soon contracted him to produce an album for Wilson, which resulted in the hit single \u201cWhispers (Getting Louder).\u201d With much bigger plans in mind, Tarnopol made Davis his Executive Vice President of A&R and set his sights on the vast pool of talent in Chicago."}, {"url": "https://infogalactic.com/info/Decca_Records", "page_content": "From Infogalactic: the planetary knowledge core\n\nFor the whole group of Decca labels, see Decca Label Group\n\nDecca Records began as a British record label established in 1929 by Edward Lewis. Its U.S. label was established in late 1934 by Lewis along with American Decca's first president Jack Kapp and later American Decca president Milton Rackmil; as a result of World War II, the link with the British company was broken for several decades.[1]\n\nThe British label was renowned for its development of recording methods, while the American company developed the concept of cast albums in the musical genre. Both wings are now part of the Universal Music Group, which is owned by Vivendi, a media conglomerate headquartered in Paris, France. The US Decca label was the foundation label, which evolved into UMG.\n\nLabel name\n\nThe name \"Decca\" was coined by Wilfred S. Samuel by merging the word \"Mecca\" with the initial D of their logo \"Dulcet\" or their trademark \"Dulcephone.\"[2] Samuel, a linguist, chose \"Decca\" as a brand name as it was easy to pronounce in most languages.\n\nThe name dates back to a portable gramophone called the \"Decca Dulcephone\" patented in 1914 by musical instrument makers Barnett Samuel and Sons. That company was eventually renamed the Decca Gramophone Co. Ltd. and then sold to former stockbroker Edward Lewis in 1929. Within years, Decca Records Ltd. was the second largest record label in the world, calling itself \"The Supreme Record Company\".\n\nDecca bought the UK branch of Brunswick Records and continued to run it under that name.\n\nIn the 1950s the American Decca studios were located in the Pythian Temple in New York City.[3]\n\nClassical music\n\nSea Drift by Original 1929 Decca release ofby Delius , first published recording of the work, but deleted by 1936\n\nIn classical music, Decca had a long way to go from its modest beginnings to catch up with the established HMV and Columbia labels (later merged as EMI). The pre-war classical repertoire on Decca was not extensive, but was select. The 3-disc 1929 recording of Delius's Sea Drift, arising from the Delius Festival that year, suffered by being crammed onto six sides and was withdrawn before 1936, probably as a result of the standardisation on 78 revolutions per minute. However, it won Decca the loyalty of the baritone Roy Henderson, who went on to record for them the first complete Dido and Aeneas of Purcell with Nancy Evans and the Boyd Neel ensemble (Purcell Club, 14 sides, pre-1936); and Henderson's famous pupil Kathleen Ferrier was recorded and issued by Decca through the period of transition from 78 to LP (1946\u20131952). Heinrich Schlusnus made important pre-war lieder recordings for Decca.\n\nDecca's emergence as a major classical label may be attributed to three concurrent events: the emphasis on technical innovation (first the development of the FFRR technique, then the early use of stereophonic recording), the introduction of the long-playing record, and the recruitment of John Culshaw to Decca's London office.\n\nDecca released the stereo recordings of Ernest Ansermet conducting L'Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, including, in 1959, the first stereo LP album of the complete Nutcracker, as well as Ansermet's only stereo version of Manuel de Falla's The Three-Cornered Hat, which the conductor had led at its first performance in 1919.\n\nJohn Culshaw, who joined Decca in 1946 in a junior post, rapidly became a senior producer of classical recordings. He revolutionised recording \u2013 of opera, in particular. Hitherto, the practice had been to put microphones in front of the performers and simply record what they performed. Culshaw was determined to make recordings that would be 'a theatre of the mind', making the listener's experience at home not second best to being in the opera house, but a wholly different experience. To that end he got the singers to move about in the studio as they would onstage, used discreet sound effects and different acoustics, and recorded in long continuous takes. His skill, coupled with Decca engineering, took Decca into the first flight of recording companies. His pioneering recording (begun in 1958) of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen conducted by Georg Solti was a huge artistic and commercial success (to the chagrin of other companies). In the wake of Decca's lead, artists such as Herbert von Karajan, Joan Sutherland and later Luciano Pavarotti were keen to join the company's roster.\n\nHowever, Culshaw was, strictly speaking, not the first to do this. In 1951, Columbia Records executive Goddard Lieberson partnered with Broadway conductor Lehman Engel to record a series of previously unrecorded Broadway musical scores for Columbia Masterworks, including what Engel, in his book The American Musical Theatre: A Consideration, termed \"Broadway opera\", and in 1951, they released the most complete Porgy and Bess recorded up to that time. Far from being a mere rendering of the score, the 3-LP album set used sound effects to realistically recreate the production as if the listener were watching a stage performance of the work.\n\nDecca logo used on classical music releases\n\nUntil 1947, American Decca issued British Decca classical music recordings. Afterwards, British Decca took over distribution through its new American subsidiary London Records. American Decca actively re-entered the classical music field in 1950 with distribution deals from Deutsche Grammophon and Parlophone.[4] American Decca began issuing its own classical music recordings in 1956 when Israel Horowitz joined Decca to head its classical music operations.[5] Among the classical recordings released on Decca's \"Gold Label\" series[6] were albums by Leroy Anderson, the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra conducted by Max Rudolf and guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia. American Decca shut down its classical music department in 1971.[7]\n\nBetween 1973 and 1980 Decca championed new music through its Headline imprint. Works given their recorded premiere included pieces by Peter Maxwell Davies, Harrison Birtwistle, Luciano Berio, Hans Werner Henze, Witold Lutoslawski, Toru Takemitsu, David Bedford, Thea Musgrave, Andrzej Panufnik, Iannis Xenakis, Brian Ferneyhough and John Cage. Performers included Roger Woodward, Stomu Yamash'ta, Salman Shukur, The Grimethorpe Colliery Band as well as the composers themselves.\n\nFor many years, Decca's British classical recordings had been issued in the US under the London Records label because the existence of the American Decca company precluded the use of that name on British recordings distributed in the US. When the MCA and PolyGram labels merged in 1999 and created Universal Music, the practice was no longer necessary. Today Decca makes fewer major classical recordings, but still has a full roster of stars, including Cecilia Bartoli and Ren\u00e9e Fleming. Its back catalogue includes several landmark and critically acclaimed recordings, such as the Solti Ring, voted the greatest recording of all time by critics with the BBC Music Magazine,[8] and Luciano Pavarotti remained an exclusive Decca artist throughout his recording career.\n\nPopular music\n\nFor a list of artists on the Decca label, see List of Decca Records artists.\n\nIn Britain, Decca bought out the bankrupt UK branch of Brunswick Records in 1932, which added such stars as Bing Crosby and Al Jolson[9] to its roster. Decca also bought out the Melotone and Edison Bell record companies. In late 1934, a United States branch of Decca was launched. In establishing the American unit, the founders bought the former Brunswick Records pressing plants in New York City and Muskegon, Michigan, which were shut down in 1931, from Warner Bros. in exchange for a financial interest in the new label.[1] Decca became a major player in the depressed American record market thanks to its roster of popular artists, particularly Bing Crosby, the shrewd management of former US Brunswick General Manager Jack Kapp, and the decision to price Decca at 35 cents. The US label also brought back the discontinued Champion label (from Gennett), as well as a short-lived version of the Broadway label. The following year, the pressing and Canadian distribution of US Decca records was licensed to Compo Company Ltd. in Lachine, Quebec, a breakaway and rival of Berliner Gram-o-phone Co. of Montreal, Quebec. (Compo was acquired by Decca in 1951 although its Apex label continued in production for the next two decades.) By 1939, Decca and EMI were the only record companies in the UK. American Decca acquired Brunswick Records and its sublabel Vocalion Records in 1941 from Warner Bros., which had a financial interest in Decca.[1]\n\nIn 1939, British Decca head Edward Lewis sold his interest in American Decca because of World War II. In 1942, stock in American Decca began trading on the New York Stock Exchange as Decca Records Inc.[1] Therefore, the two Deccas became separate companies and remained so until American Decca's parent company bought British Decca's parent company in 1998 (during this time, US Decca artists were issued in the UK on the Brunswick label until 1968 when MCA Records was launched in the UK). Artists signed to American Decca in the 1930s and 1940s included Louis Armstrong, Charlie Kunz, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Jane Froman, the Boswell Sisters, Billie Holiday, Katherine Dunham, the Andrews Sisters, Ted Lewis, Judy Garland, the Mills Brothers, Billy Cotton, Guy Lombardo, Chick Webb, Louis Jordan, Bob Crosby, Bill Kenny & the Ink Spots, the Dorsey Brothers (and subsequently Jimmy Dorsey after the brothers split), Connee Boswell and Jack Hylton, Victor Young, Earl Hines, Claude Hopkins, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe.\n\nIn 1940, American Decca released the first album of songs from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. However, it was not a soundtrack album but a cover version featuring only Judy Garland from the film, with other roles taken by the Ken Darby Singers.\n\nIn 1942, American Decca released the first recording of \"White Christmas\" by Bing Crosby. He recorded another version of the song in 1947 for Decca; to this day, Crosby's recording of \"White Christmas\" for Decca remains the best-selling single worldwide of all time.[10] In 1943, American Decca ushered in the age of the original cast album in the United States, when they released an album set of nearly all the songs from Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma!, performed by the same cast who appeared in the show on Broadway, and using the show's orchestra, conductor, chorus, and musical and vocal arrangements. The enormous success of this album was followed by original cast recordings of Carousel and Irving Berlin's Annie Get Your Gun, both featuring members of the original casts of the shows and utilizing those shows' vocal and choral arrangements. Because of the technical restrictions of recording on 78 rpm records, none of these scores were recorded totally complete; they were shorter than cast albums made after LPs were introduced. But Decca had made history by recording Broadway musicals, and the influence of these releases in the recording of theatrical shows in the U.S. continues to this day - in Decca's home country, the UK original cast albums had been a fixture for years. Columbia Records followed with musical theatre albums, starting with the 1946 revival of Show Boat. In 1947, RCA Victor released the original cast album of Brigadoon. By the 1950s, many recording companies were releasing Broadway show albums recorded by their original casts, and the recording of original cast albums had become standard practice whenever a new show opened.[11]\n\nDecca throughout the 1930s and early to mid-1940s was a leading label of blues and jump music with such best selling artists as Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Louis Jordan (who was the best selling R&B artist of the 1940s). In 1954, American Decca released \"Rock Around the Clock\" by Bill Haley & His Comets. Produced by Milt Gabler, the recording was initially only moderately successful, but when it was used as the theme song for the 1955 film Blackboard Jungle, it became the first international rock and roll hit, and the first such recording to go to No. 1 on the American musical charts. According to the Guinness Book of Records, it went on to sell 25 million copies, returning to the US and UK charts several times between 1955 and 1974.\n\nAmerican Decca embraced the new post-war record formats adopting the LP in 1949 and the 45 rpm record around a year later while continuing to sell 78s.[1] During the 1950s, American Decca released a number of soundtrack recordings of popular motion pictures, notably Mike Todd's production of Around the World in Eighty Days (1956) with the music of veteran film composer Victor Young. Since Decca had access to the stereophonic tracks of the Oscar-winning film, they quickly released a stereo version in 1958. Because American Decca bought Universal Pictures in 1952, many of these soundtrack albums were of films released by what was then called Universal-International Pictures.\n\nIn 1961, American Decca released the soundtrack album of Flower Drum Song, Universal Pictures's film version of the 1958 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical. In a reversal of the usual situation, in which American Decca had released original Broadway cast albums of three Rodgers and Hammerstein shows, this was the only film soundtrack album of a Rodgers and Hammerstein show ever released by Decca, while the Broadway cast album had been released by Columbia Masterworks.\n\nThe American RCA label severed its longtime affiliation with EMI's His Master's Voice (HMV) label in 1957, which allowed British Decca to market and distribute Elvis Presley's recordings in the UK on the RCA label (later RCA Victor).[12]\n\nBritish Decca had several missed opportunities. In 1960, they refused to release \"Tell Laura I Love Her\" by Ray Peterson and even destroyed thousands of copies of the single. A cover version by Ricky Valance was released by EMI on the Columbia label, and it went to No. 1 on the British charts for three weeks.[13] In 1962, Decca turned down a chance to record the Beatles with the comment \"Guitar groups are on the way out\", a historic mistake.[14] Other refusals of note include the Yardbirds and Manfred Mann. Decca had earlier accepted London-born pioneer rock'n'roll singer Terry Dene, who was later known as the British Elvis Presley, and another Merseyside singer, Billy Fury..[citation needed]\n\nThe turning down of the Beatles led indirectly to the signing of one of Decca's biggest 1960s artists, the Rolling Stones. Dick Rowe was judging a talent contest with George Harrison, and Harrison mentioned to him that he should take a look at the Stones, whom he had just seen live for the first time a couple of weeks earlier. Rowe saw the Stones, and quickly signed them to a contract.\n\nStaff producer Hugh Mendl (1919\u20132008)[15] worked for Decca for over 40 years and played a significant role in its success in the popular field from the 1950s to the late 1970s. His first major production credit was pianist Winifred Atwell. He produced Rock Island Line, the breakthrough skiffle hit for Lonnie Donegan, and he is credited as the first executive to spot the potential of singer-actor Tommy Steele. Mendl's other productions included the first album by humorist Ivor Cutler, Who Tore Your Trousers? (1961), Frankie Howerd at The Establishment (1963), a series of recordings with Paddy Roberts (best known for \"The Ballad of Bethnal Green\"), numerous \"original cast\" and soundtrack albums including Oh! What a Lovely War and even an LP record of the 1966 Le Mans 24-hour race, inspired by his lifelong passion for motor-racing. Mendl was a driving force in the establishment of Decca's progressive Deram label, most notably as the executive producer of the Moody Blues' groundbreaking 1967 LP Days of Future Passed. He is credited with battling against Decca's notorious parsimonious treatment of their artists, ensuring that the Moody Blues had the time and resources to develop beyond their beat group origins into progressive rock, and he also used profits for pop sales to cross-subsidise recordings by avant garde jazz artists like John Surman.\n\nBritish Decca lost a key source for American records when Atlantic Records switched British distribution to Polydor Records in 1966 in order for Atlantic to gain access to British recording artists which they did not have under Decca distribution.[16][17] The Rolling Stones left Decca in 1970, and other artists followed. Decca's deals with numerous other record labels began to fall apart: RCA Records, for instance, abandoned Decca to set up its own UK office in June 1969, just before the Rolling Stones did the same thing. The Moody Blues were the only international rock act that remained on the label. The company's fortunes declined slightly during the 1970s, and it had few major commercial successes; among those were Dana's 1970 two-million selling single, \"All Kinds of Everything\", issued on their subsidiary label Rex Records.\n\nAlthough Decca had set up the first of the British \"progressive\" labels, Deram, in 1966, with such stars as Cat Stevens and the Moody Blues, by the time the punk era set in 1977, Decca had pop success with such acts as John Miles, novelty creation Father Abraham and the Smurfs, and productions by longtime Decca associate Jonathan King. King had a hit, \"Everyone's Gone to the Moon\", on Decca while he was an undergraduate at Trinity College, Cambridge and Edward Lewis recruited him as his personal assistant and \"talent spotter\".[18][19] Decca became dependent on re-releases from its back catalogue. Contemporary signings, such as Slaughter & The Dogs and the pre-stardom Adam and the Ants (whose sole single with Decca, \"Young Parisians\", would later be a UK Top 10 hit on the back of the band's success at CBS),[20][21] were second division when compared to the likes of PolyGram, CBS, EMI, and newcomer Virgin's rosters of hitmakers.\n\nSpoken word\n\nAmerican Decca also released several notable spoken word albums, such as a recording of Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol starring Ronald Colman as Scrooge, and a recording of the Christmas chapter from The Pickwick Papers read by Charles Laughton. These two separate 78-RPM albums were later combined onto one LP. Other spoken word albums included Lullaby of Christmas, narrated by Gregory Peck, a twenty-minute version of Moby Dick, with Charles Laughton as Captain Ahab, and The Littlest Angel, narrated by Loretta Young. British Decca released on LP, in 1968, the most complete version of Man of La Mancha ever put on vinyl records, a 2-LP album featuring most of the dialogue and all of the songs, performed by the show's original London cast. Keith Michell starred as Don Quixote and Cervantes, and Joan Diener was Aldonza/Dulcinea. Around 1970, American Decca enjoyed success with LPS of soundtrack dialogue excerpts from the films of W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers, and Mae West. The Fields and Marx Brothers albums were narrated by radio personality and cartoon voice actor Gary Owens.\n\nCountry music\n\nShort-lived Decca Records country music label logo\n\nIn 1934, Jack Kapp established a country & western line for the new Decca label by signing Frank Luther, Sons of the Pioneers, Stuart Hamblen, The Ranch Boys, and other popular acts based in both New York and Los Angeles. Louisiana singer/composer Jimmie Davis began recording for Decca the same year, joined by western vocalists Jimmy Wakely and Roy Rogers in 1940.[citation needed] From the late 1940s on, the US arm of Decca had a sizeable roster of Country artists, including Kitty Wells, Johnny Wright, Moon Mullican, Ernest Tubb, Webb Pierce, the Wilburn Brothers, Bobbejaan Schoepen, and Red Foley. The main architect of Decca's success in country music was Owen Bradley, who joined Decca in 1947 and was promoted to Vice-President and head of A&R for the Nashville operations in 1958.[22] Decca quickly became the main rival of RCA Records as the top label for American country music, and remained so for several decades.\n\nAs part of a licensing agreement with 4 Star Records, Patsy Cline joined the Decca roster in 1956 (after releasing three singles on Decca's Coral Records subsidiary, under the same agreement, beginning in 1955). While Cline's contract was held by 4 Star, the deal allowed Decca complete control of the recording sessions, including choice of Producer and musicians. However, it also restricted the choice of material available for Cline to record to only songs published by 4 Star. This proved to be a stipulation which hampered her career for several years. Between 1955-60, Cline recorded one album and multiple singles under the agreement, but saw limited chart success and very little money. In 1960, she signed directly with Decca. No longer bound by the restrictions of the 4 Star agreement, Cline went on to achieve tremendous success on both the Country and Pop charts. She recorded two more albums, and released numerous singles, before her untimely death in a 1963 plane crash. A number of posthumous singles and albums appeared in the years following.\n\nThe Wilburn Brothers signed to the label in 1954, and were ultimately awarded a lifetime contract (20 years) in 1966. Doyle Wilburn negotiated a recording contract for Loretta Lynn, who signed to Decca in 1961 and remained with the label for over 25 years. Loretta was known as the \"Decca Doll\" until she became better known as the \"Coal Miner's Daughter.\"\n\nDecca's country music branch was revived in 1994, with Dawn Sears being the first act signed to the newly reformed label.[23] Other artists signed to the label would include Rhett Akins, Gary Allan, Mark Chesnutt, and Lee Ann Womack; of these, all but Sears and Akins would be shifted to the MCA Nashville roster after parent Universal Music absorbed PolyGram in 1998 and shut down Decca Nashville. In 2008, the Decca country division was briefly revived again with One Flew South becoming the only act signed to it.\n\nTechnology developments\n\nffrr\n\nFull frequency range recording (ffrr) was a spin-off devised by Arthur Haddy[24] of British Decca's development, during the Second World War, of a high fidelity hydrophone capable of detecting and cataloguing individual German submarines by each one's signature engine noise, and enabled a greatly enhanced frequency range (high and low notes) to be captured on recordings.[25] Critics regularly commented on the startling realism of the new Decca recordings. The frequency range of ffrr was 80\u201315000 Hz, with a signal-to-noise ratio of 60 dB. While Decca's early ffrr releases on 78-rpm discs had some noticeable surface noise, which diminished the effects of the high fidelity sound, the introduction of long-playing records in 1949 made better use of the new technology and set an industry standard that was quickly imitated by Decca's competitors. Nonetheless titles first issued on 78rpm remained in that form in the Decca catalogues into the early 1950s. The ffrr technique became internationally accepted and considered a standard. The Ernest Ansermet recording of Stravinsky's Petrushka was key in the development of full frequency range records and alerting the listening public to high fidelity in 1946.[26]\n\nThe LP\n\nThe long-playing record was launched in the USA in 1948 by Columbia Records (not connected with the British company of the same name at the time). It enabled recordings to play for up to half an hour without a break, compared with the 3 to 5 minutes playing time of the existing records. The new records were made of vinyl (the old discs were made of brittle shellac), which enabled the ffrr recordings to be transferred to disc very realistically. In both the UK and the US Decca took up the LP promptly and enthusiastically, in 1949,[1] giving the British arm an enormous advantage over EMI, which for some years tried to stick exclusively to the old format, thereby forfeiting competitive advantage to Decca, both artistically and financially.\n\nBritish Decca recorded high fidelity versions of all the symphonies of Ralph Vaughan Williams except for the ninth, under the personal supervision of the composer, with Sir Adrian Boult and the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Benjamin Britten conducted recordings of many of his compositions for Decca, from the 1940s through the 1970s; most of these recordings have been reissued on CD.\n\nStereo (ffss)\n\nThe British Decca recording engineers Arthur Haddy, Roy Wallace and Kenneth Wilkinson developed in 1954 the famous Decca tree, a stereo microphone recording system for big orchestras.\n\nDecca started first actual stereophonic recording in 13\u201328 May 1954, at Victoria Hall, Geneva, the first European record company to do so, only three months former, RCA Victor began first actual stereophonic recording in the U.S., 6&8 March 1954. Decca archives show that Ernest Ansermet and the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande recorded Antar by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov (This is the official first actual stereo recording of Decca); Stenka Razin by Alexander Glazunov; Tamara by Mily Balakirev; Anatoly Liadov's Baba-Yaga, Eight Russian Folksongs, Kikimora; and Le Martyre de saint S\u00e9bastien by Claude Debussy. These performances were initially issued only in monaural sound; and in 1959,the stereo version of Le Martyre de saint S\u00e9bastien was issued only in U.S. as London Label (Record No. OSA 1104(OS 25108)) ; and stereo versions of others were finally issued from the late 1960s to the beginning of the 1970s as part of the \"\"Decca eclipse\"\" series (in U.K.) or \"Stereo Treasury\" series (in U.S. as London Label).[27]\n\n\n\nThe Decca Stereo format was called (in succession to ffrr), \"ffss\", i.e. \"full frequency stereophonic sound\". with most competitors not using stereo until 1957, the new technique was a distinctive feature of Decca's. Even after stereo became standard and into the 1970s, Decca boasted a special, spectacular sound quality, characterised by aggressive use of the highest and lowest frequencies, daring use of tape saturation and out-of-phase sound to convey a lively and impactful hall ambiance, plus considerable bar-to-bar rebalancing by the recording staff of orchestral voices, known as \"spotlighting.\" In the 1960s and 1970s, the company developed its \"Phase 4\" process which produced even greater sonic impact through even more interventionist engineering techniques. Big-band leader Ted Heath was an early pioneer of the Decca \"Phase 4\" sound. Decca recorded some quadrophonic masters that were released in Sansui's quadraphonic system called QS Regular Matrix.\n\nDigital recording and mastering\n\nStarting in the late 1978, British Decca developed their own digital audio recorders used in-house for recording, mixing, editing, and mastering albums. Each recorder consisted of a modified IVC model 826P open-reel 1-inch VTR, connected to a custom codec unit with time code capability (using a proprietary time code developed by Decca), as well as outboard DAC and ADC units connected to the codec unit. The codec recorded audio to tape in 18 bits linear,fs=48 kHz,Maxmim to 8 Channel Multi Tracks (although later versions of the system used 20 bits). With the exception of the IVC VTRs (which were modified to Decca's specifications by IVC's UK division in Reading), all the electronics for these systems were developed and manufactured in-house by Decca (and by contractors to them as well). These digital systems were used for mastering most of Decca's classical music releases to both LP and CD, and were used well into the late 1990s. After the start of the new century, Decca became actively involved in pioneering a new generation of high-resolution and multi-channel recordings, including \"Super Audio CD\" (SACD) and \"DVD-Audio\" (DVD-A) formats. Decca is now routinely mastering new recordings in these formats.\n\nDecca Special Products\n\nDecca Special Products developed a number of products for the audio marketplace. These include:\n\nThe Decca Ribbon Tweeter\n\nDecca London phonograph cartridges : The Decca phono cartridges were a unique design, with fixed magnets and coils. The stylus shaft was composed of the diamond tip, a short piece of soft iron, and an L-shaped cantilever made of non-magnetic steel. Since the iron was placed very close to the tip (within 1 mm), the motions of the tip could be tracked very accurately. Decca engineers called this \"positive scanning\". Vertical and lateral compliance was controlled by the shape and thickness of the cantilever. Decca cartridges had a reputation for being very musical; however, early versions required more tracking force than competitive designs - making record wear a concern\n\n: The Decca phono cartridges were a unique design, with fixed magnets and coils.

They were designed to complement the Decca phono cartridges. They would enjoy a brief renaissance in the 21st century as they were almost a drop-in replacement for the pick-up arms of Lenco GL75 record turntables from the 1970s. The arm damping was via a viscous silicone fluid held in a well, and magnetic repelling force supported the arm, and provided anti-skate (bias compensation). New Old Stock arms rapidly sold out by 2008 as vintage hifi enthusiasts sought them for refurbishment projects.\n\n: The Decca International tone arms were fluid-damped unipivot designs.

The idea of using carbon fibre (CF) to clean LPs came from Tristan Cooper who obtained some CF for use in his GRP racing car body. CF is very fine, stiff, and conducts electricity, making it ideal for cleaning narrow record grooves and conducting away any static electricity build-up. Tristan's brother Warwick developed the manufacturing process for the brushes, producing hundreds of thousands of \"Million Bristle\" CF brushes under the Decca brand.\n\nDecca Special Products was spun off, and is now known as London Decca.\n\nThe American branch of Decca also marketed its own line of home audio equipment.[28]\n\nLater history\n\nFile:Deccaarrow.png [29] introduced in the United Kingdom in 1967. 1960s American Decca logo with the harlequin holding a globe, which was American Decca's trademark. This was similar to the first MCA Records logointroduced in the United Kingdom in 1967.\n\nAmerican Decca bought Universal-International in 1952, and eventually merged with MCA Inc. in 1962, becoming a subsidiary company under MCA. Dissatisfied with American Decca's promotion of British Decca recordings and because American Decca held the rights to the name Decca in the US and Canada, British Decca sold its records in the United States and Canada under the label London Records beginning in 1947. In Britain, London Records became a mighty catch-all licensing label for foreign recordings from the nascent post-WW II American independent and semi-major labels such as Cadence, ABC-Paramount, Atlantic, Imperial and Liberty. Conversely, British Decca retained a non-reciprocal right to license and issue American Decca recordings in the UK on their Brunswick Records (US Decca recordings) and Coral Records (US Brunswick and Coral recordings) labels; this arrangement continued through 1967 when a UK branch of MCA was established utilising the MCA Records label, with distribution fluctuating between British Decca and other English companies over time.\n\nIn Canada, the Compo Company was reorganised into MCA Records (Canada) in 1970.[30] In Taiwan, PolyGram acquired 60% of Linfair Magnetic Sound (founded in 1961) in 1992, and renamed to Decca Records Taiwan. The name remains until 2002, when it decided to sell its 60 percent stake, and changed its name to Linfair Records, making the company independent from Universal Music. In addition to Decca label, Linfair Records also distribute V2 Records' releases, and some independent labels. However, Linfair Records' releases outside Taiwan will continue to be released internationally via Universal Music.\n\nThe Decca name was dropped by MCA in America in 1973 in favour of the MCA Records label. The first-run American Decca label went out with a big bang with its final release, \"Drift Away\" by Dobie Gray in 1973 (label No. 33057), reaching No. 5 on the Billboard chart and receiving gold record status.\n\nPolyGram acquired the remains of Decca UK within days of Sir Edward Lewis's death in January 1980. British Decca's pop catalogue was taken over by Polydor Records. Ironically, PolyGram descended from British Decca's former Dutch distributor Hollandsche Decca Distributie.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, MCA Nashville Records revived Decca in the US as a country music label. The Decca label is currently in use by Universal Music Group worldwide; this is possible because Universal Studios (which officially dropped the MCA name after the Seagram buyout in 1997) acquired PolyGram, British Decca's parent company in 1998, thus consolidating Decca trademark ownership. In the US, the Decca country music label was shut down and the London classical label was renamed as it was able to use the Decca name for the first time because of the merger that created Universal Music. In 1999, Decca absorbed Philips Records to create the Decca Music Group (half of Universal Music Classics Group in the USA, with Deutsche Grammophon being the other half).\n\nToday, Decca is a leading label for both classical music and Broadway scores although it is branching out into pop music from established recording stars: its most recent hit was Motown: A Journey Through Hitsville USA (2007) by Boyz II Men, which reached No. 27 on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. In 2007 they won the race to sign English teen jazz sensation Victoria Hart and released her first album Whatever Happened to Romance in July.[31] In December 2007, it was announced that Morrissey would be joining the Decca roster. In August 2009, it was revealed that American Idol alum, Clay Aiken, had signed with Decca.[32] It reentered the American country music scene in 2008. There are two Universal Music label groups now using the Decca name. The Decca Label Group is the US label whereas the London-based Decca Music Group runs the international classical and pop releases by such world famous performers as Andrea Bocelli and Hayley Westenra. The London Records pop label that was established in the UK in 1990, run by Roger Ames, and distributed by PolyGram became part of WEA in 2000 when he was hired to run that company.\n\nIt is also the distributing label of POINT Music, a joint venture between Universal and Philip Glass's Euphorbia Productions that folded shortly after the merger that created Universal Music. Ironically, the American Decca classical music catalogue is managed by sister Universal label Deutsche Grammophon. They include the recordings of guitarist Andr\u00e9s Segovia.[33] Before Deutsche Grammophon founded its own American branch in 1969, it had a distribution deal with American Decca until 1962 when distribution switched to MGM Records.[34] \u00c9ditions de l'Oiseau-Lyre is a wholly owned subsidiary specialising in European classical music of the 15th to 19th centuries. American Decca's jazz catalogue is managed by GRP Records, an imprint of Verve Records. The American Decca rock/pop catalogue is managed by Geffen Records. The Decca Broadway imprint is used for both newly recorded musical theatre songs and Universal Music Group's vast catalogues of musical theatre recordings from record labels UMG and predecessor companies acquired over the years.\n\nOn 10 January 2011, Universal Music Group, which owns the masters to Decca Records, announced that it was donating 200,000 of its master recordings from the 1920s to the 1940s to the United States Library of Congress. The collection of master recordings will be cleaned and digitised. Included in this group are Bing Crosby's original recording of 'White Christmas' and thousands more by Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, Judy Garland, Tommy Dorsey, Jimmy Dorsey, the Andrews Sisters and other famous and lesser-known musicians who recorded during this time period. Because of this transaction, once the Library has organised and cleaned the collection, the public will eventually have some degree of access to thousands of recordings that have been commercially unavailable for decades. According to the Los Angeles Times, \"[a]s part of the agreement between UMG and the library, Universal retains ownership of the recording copyrights and the right to exploit the cleaned-up and digitized files for commercial purposes.\"[35]\n\nToday, Decca distributes UMG's jazz holdings led by Blue Note Records and Verve Records along with the classical music holdings led by Decca Classics, Philips Records and Deutsche Grammophon. They also distribute recordings from the Concord Music Group and Rounder Records.[36]\n\nDecca matrix prefixes\n\nSee also\n\nSelected affiliated labels\n\nPersonnel & staff\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found.\n\nLua error in package.lua at line 80: module 'strict' not found. - See the chapter on \"Getting on Record\", pp. 62\u201375, about the early record industry and Fred Gaisberg and Walter Legge and ffrr (Full Frequency Range Recording)."}, {"url": "https://www.spiralclassics.co.uk/guide-to-collecting/decca", "page_content": "Guide to Collecting: Decca\n\nDecca started issuing LPs in 1950, and started issuing Stereo LPs in 1958. They produced some of the finest stereo LPs, and many collectors particularly value the \"Decca Sound\". English Decca is entirely different from the US Decca company. Many English Decca pressings were issued in the US on the London label, with the prefix CS.\n\nTable of contents\n\nDecca SXL\n\nWide band\n\nSo first let\u2019s look at a \u201cwide band\u201d Decca label.\n\nIt has \u201cffss\u201d in a silver circle at the top of the label. The \u201cwide band\u201d is the the silver band just above the spindle hole, that says \u201cFull Frequency Stereophonic Sound\u201d.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, collectors divided Decca SXL wide band labels into 3 categories.\n\nED1\n\nED1 is the first wide band label. They have \u201cOriginal Recording\" between 9 & 12 o'clock, round the edge of the label. And they have a groove in the vinyl, under the label, about 1cm from the outer edge of the label. This groove is what makes it a \u201cgroove pressing\u201d. A few very early issues have the groove very near the edge of the label - about 2mm from the edge. These are very rare and are called pancake pressings.\n\nAll the SXL 2000 series have an ED1 label as their first label. A lot of SXL 6000s series have ED1 as their first label too.\n\nSee all the SXL ED1s I have in stock\n\nThe highest number ED1 in the SXL 6000 series that I have ever seen is SXL 6363. That was issued in 1968. But a lot of lower numbered SXL 6000s don\u2019t have an ED1 label, their original label is ED2.\n\nED2\n\nED2 is the second wide band label. They have \"Made in England\" between 9 & 12 o'clock, round the edge of the label. And they have a groove in the vinyl, under the label, about 1cm from the outer edge of the label.\n\nFor early SXLs, SXL 2000 series and many SXL 6000 series, ED2 is not the original label, as the original label is ED1. But there are many in the SXL 6000 series where ED2 is the original label, and no ED1 label exists. All SXL wide bands from SXL 6364 onward have ED2 or ED3 as the original label. But so do many earlier SXL 6000 series. Again we\u2019ll talk more about that later.\n\nSee all the SXL ED2s I have in stock\n\nED3\n\nED3 is the third and last wide band label. They have \"Made in England\" between 9 & 12 o'clock, round the edge of the label, but they don\u2019t have a groove in the pressing.\n\nAgain, ED3 is the original label for many SXLs. But where ED2 is the original label, then ED3 is the second label. And where ED1 is the original label, ED3 is the third label. So, for example, if you have an SXL 2000 series with an ED3 label, then it is the third label. The lowest number original ED3 is SXL 6355 and the last ED3 is SXL 6448\n\nSee all the SXL ED3s I have in stock\n\nAs you can see from all this, it can be hard to know which SXL 6000 series have which label as their original, first label. Over the 28 years Spiral Classics has been selling LPs, I have compiled a database of over 40,000 records that have been through my hands. So I've been able to use my database, together with research online, to establish what the original labels are. If you'd like to know what the original label is for any wide-band SXL 6000 series, whether ED1, ED2, or ED3 , you can look at my original labels resource. (All SXL 2000 series have ED1 as their original label, but I have included the 2000 series to note which ones weren't issued and which ones are part of a 2, 3 or 4 record set.)\n\nNarrow band\n\nThe last ED3 is SXL 6448. All SXLs from SXL 6449 onwards have a narrow band label as their original label. Some call this ED4. English pressed narrow band labels have a silver rectangle that says DECCA, and \u201cMade in England\u201d in small print above the rectangle. As you can see the silver band saying \u201cFull Frequency Stereophonic Sound\u201d (below the rectangle), is narrower than the wide band on ED1, ED2, ED3.\n\nSee all the SXL narrow bands I have in stock\n\nDutch pressings\n\nIn 1979 Decca moved their pressing plant to Holland. SXLs pressed in Holland say \u201cMade in Holland\u201d at the bottom of the label. They have a slightly raised are around the edge of the label. I call these \u201cDutch pressings\u201d. All Decca records issued from 1980 onwards are Dutch pressings. A few SXLs issued in 1979 are English pressings, but most are Dutch pressings.\n\nBlue back sleeves\n\nA few of the earliest SXL 2000 series have a \u201cblue back sleeve\u201d. Sometimes described as a \u201cblue riband\u201d\n\nThese are quite rare, and only the first few SXLs issued had these sleeves on the earliest pressing. The last blue back sleeve I know of is SXL 2115, but there are probably earlier numbers where no blue back sleeve exists\n\nSXL boxed sets\n\nDecca issued SXL boxed sets from 1958 to 1960, in the SXL 2000 series, such as SXL 2101/3 Rheingold, SXL 2215/7 Die Zauberfl\u00f6te. In 1962 they started issuing boxed sets on the SET label (see below), then from 1965 to 1974 they issued SXL boxes in the SXL 6000 series, such as SXL 6238/41, Vienna Chamber Music Festival, SXL 6586/7, Alicia de Larrocha playing Albeniz, SXL 6620/2, Prokofiev Romeo and Juliet. Then from 1970 they issued boxed sets with a letter after the SXL, starting with SXLA 6452/61, Backhaus playing the Beethoven Piano Sonatas, that had been recorded between 1960 and 1969, and ending with SXLM 6665/7, Dorati conducting Kodaly Orchestral Works, all recorded in 1974. So some of these boxed sets pulled together earlier recordings, while others were original recordings. SXLH 6610/3, Kertesz conducting Brahms Symphonies was the first issue of all except Symphony no 2.\n\nWhich Decca SXL label should you buy?\n\nSome collectors want original labels. These are often the most expensive. They are certainly the most \u201ccollectable\u201d. Many collectors believe that original labels have the best sound, but I don\u2019t agree that this is always the case. Vinyl from the late 1950s and early 1960s has a slightly noisier surface than vinyl pressed in the mid 1960s onwards. You get a quieter surface on ED2 pressings and on ED3 pressings. They are all \u201caudiophile\u201d pressings with superb sound quality. As indeed are very many narrow bands. Second and third labels are a good deal less expensive than \u201coriginal\u201d labels, and I recommend them, as it is sound quality that interests me most. So you don\u2019t need to spend a fortune to start to build up a superb-sounding collection of SXLs.\n\nNote: Some less experienced sellers have recently been using the term ED1 incorrectly. They think ED1 means \u201cfirst edition\u201d. They call an any SXL that it is the first pressing of that recording \u201cED1\u201d. I have seen original ED3 labels described as ED1. The unwary buyer thinks they have found a very rare item with an ED1 label. You can be sure if you buy from Spiral Classics that when I say that the label is ED1, it is the ED1 label that I have shown you above.\n\nDecca SET series\n\nThe SET series are also an original Decca label. Decca usually used the SET prefix for records that have a libretto, like Opera boxed sets, Oratorios, and recitals by Singers. But occasionally they used the SET prefix for other records, such as SET 332, Bernstein conducting - and playing - Mozart, and SET 231, Karajan conducting Brahms. They started issuing SETs in 1962. Before that, Opera sets had SXL record codes.\n\nThe labels are identical to ED1, ED2, ED3, and narrow band except for their colour. They are silver on plum.\n\nThese recordings have the superb SXL sound. The Opera recordings are magical! And many of them are amazingly good value.\n\nSee all the Decca SETs I have in stock\n\nDecca Mono LXT\n\nDecca first started issuing LPs in 1950, starting with LXT 2501, Bach Brandenburg Concertos nos 4 & 6, conducted Munchinger, with Rheinhold Barchet as the violinist. The last of the LXT 2000 series was LXT 2999, issued in 1955, Dvorak Cello Concerto, conducted Kubelik, with the cellist Pierre Fournier.\n\nAll the LXT 2000 series have a gold/orange label as their first label. The label is orange and the print is gold.\n\nIn 1955 Decca started their LXT 5000 series with a set of 3 LPs, LXT 5000/2, Mendelssohn's Elijah, conducted Joseph Krips, using the gold/orange label. The last gold/orange label that I'm certain of is LXT 5123, Backhaus playing Mozart. But just as with the stereo labels, some of the LXT numbers earlier than LXT 5123 have Decca's next LXT label, silver/orange, as their first label. The silver/orange label is still orange, but the print is silver. Between LXT 5117 and LXT 5127 some are silver, some are gold. See https://www.spiralclassics.co.uk/original-labels for full information\n\nIt can be quite hard to distinguish between the gold/orange label and the silver/orange label, particularly in photos on the web. But when you have the two labels side by side in your hand you can see the difference. The most marked difference is that the vinyl under the gold orange label is flat, while the silver/orange label has a deep groove, between the silver line round the circumference and the edge of the label, so about 2mm from the label edge. There are exceptions, which I'll come to!\n\nSome LXTs in the 5000 series are re-issues of early LXT 2000s. Possibly this is because of improvements in the technology. For example LXT 5362/3, Erich Kleiber conducting Beethoven's Symphony no 9 (coupled with Schuricht conducting Symphony no 1) was issued in 1957. This recording of Symphony no 9 was first issued on LXT 2725/6 in 1952. Backhaus's early recordings of Beethoven Piano Concertos were first issued in 1951 & 1953, on LXT 2553, LXT 2629 & LXT 2839. They were issued again in 1957 on LXT 5253, LXT 5354, LXT 5355.\n\nIn 1958 Decca started issuing stereo records on SXL. But they continued to issue mono LXTs, some are mono issues of the SXL recordings, some are mono-only issues, with no SXL issued. The last mono-only issue in the LXT 5000 series that I know of is LXT 5516, a Piano Recital by Peter Katin. The last LXT 5000 series that I know of is LXT 5682, the original mono issue of SXL 2313, La Fille Mal Gardee. And that brings me to the exception I mentioned above. LXT issues of recordings also issued on SXL often have the groove pressing that we see in SXLs, with the groove 1 cm from the edge of the label.\n\n)\n\nLXTs continued to be issued in the 1960s, with the LXT 6000 series starting in 1962. The first one was LXT 6003, Honneger's Christmas Cantata & Symphony for Strings, which is the mono issue of SXL 6003. LXT 6000 series have the same numbering as the equivalent SXL.\n\nWhich Decca LXT label should you buy?\n\nI find it very difficult to advise on this. When I've tried to compare different labels of the same recording I've found the sound is different but not necessarily that the sound is better on the gold/orange copy or better on the silver/orange copy. Just different. Some of the early gold/orange LXTs have magical sound. But so do the silver/orange ones! One point worth noting is that the later labels (so pressed after 1955) will have quieter vinyl as the quality of vinyl was improving through the 1950s, just as it continued to do in the 1960s. I'd be interested to hear from collectors who've made comparisons themselves.\n\nDecca Re-issues\n\nAce of Diamonds\n\nYou don't need to spend a fortune on early SXLs to get superb early Decca recordings. Decca started issuing Ace of Diamonds, with the prefix SDD, in 1965. The earliest issues were groove pressings, just like SXLs. Some of them were in fact SXL 2000 series that had been pressed but not yet sold. They were labelled SDD and sold at a cheaper price than SXLs. They have the same matrices as the original SXLs.\n\nThis earliest label always has FULL FREQUENCY RANGE RECORDING in the top half of the label, and has a groove, just like SXL ED1s and ED2s. I call this the original ffrr label. By 1968 most of the SDDs had the ffrr label but many were not groove pressings, so are similar to the ED3 label.\n\nIn 1968 Decca started using a slightly smaller label. I think of this as the equivalent of the SXL narrow band. But just as with SXLs there isn't a clear cut-off point when they changed to the small label.\n\nAll SDD 185s have a small label. But some later numbers have an original ffrr label. The highest number ffrr label I know of is SDD 197.\n\nMost, but not all SDDs were re-issues of SXLs. Some were the first stereo issue of recordings that were only originally issued in mono, for example SDD 247, Ansermet conducting Stravinsky. And some were original first issues such as SDD 250, Dvorak played by the Janacek Quartet.\n\nNot all Ace of Diamonds have the SDD prefix. Decca used GOS for Ace of Diamond Opera sets. The labels are very similar to the SDD labels\n\nMost of these are re-issues of SXL opera recordings. The exception is GOS 558/9. Britten's Prince of the Pagodas which is the original issue.\n\nGOS are not the only SDD boxed sets. There are also SDD boxed sets with an extra letter after the SDD, for example SDDA 261/9, Brahms Complete Works for Piano, played by Julius Katchen, SDDF 337/9, Ansermet conducts Ravel. They all have the small SDD label as original.\n\nDecca Eclipse: ECS\n\nThere are some wonderful stereo recordings on the Eclipse label issued from 1970 to 1978. But if you are picking up records in a charity shop or thrift shop you need to be aware that many of the earlier Eclipse issues are electronic stereo re-issues of mono recordings. You need to look at the back of the sleeve, next to the spine, where this is an arrow pointing down to some text that tells you if this is a stereo recording. If you see an ECS in my stock list you can be sure that it is genuine stereo, as I don't stock the electronic stereo ECSs. Many of the genuine stereo Eclipse issues are recordings that were not issued on SXL. Some of them were early recordings in stereo made in the late 1950s and but only the mono version was originally issued. For example ECS 595, Ricci, Virtuoso Showpieces, and ECS 697, Ferras playing Mozart Violin Concertos. Others are re-issues of splendid RCA stereo recordings such as ECS 580, Martinon conducting Shostakovich, and ECS 674, Reiner conducting Strauss Till Eulenspiegel. Others still are recordings that were only issued originally on the London label, such as ECS 663, Campoli playing Saint-Saens, and ECS 746, Ricci playing Prokofiev. A few were never previously issued such as ECS 620 & ECS 621, Magaloff playing Chopin Mazurkas. and ECS 639, Campoli Encores. From about 1972 onwards Decca re-issued many superb early SXL 2000 series on ECS.\n\nOther Guide sections\n\nReturn to Guide to Collecting"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/john-loder", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nJohn Loder (John Muir Lowe) was born on 3 January, 1898 in London, England, UK, is an Actor.

Compared to Victor, EMI, or Columbia, Decca got a late start, but it quickly made up for lost time.\n\nThe Decca trade name was first used in 1914 for a portable gramophone manufactured by a company Barnett Samuel & Sons Ltd., called the Dulcephone. Many of these machines were used to provide entertainment to British soldiers in the trenches during World War I. Later, Barnett Samuel and Sons changed its name to Decca. There were actually two branches of Decca, the first established in England and the second some years later in the United States. Edward Lewis established the Decca Record Company in England in 1929. Lewis remained the chairman of the company until his death in 1980.\n\nEnglish Decca achieved international recognition after World War II when it introduced an improved disc that used what it called full frequency range recording (FFRR). These records were recorded using improved recording equipment, and were as good or better than the LP and 45-rpm records that appeared in 1948 and 1949. FFRR was not as catchy as the term high fidelity, so the name did not catch on, but record collectors appreciated the improved sound quality.\n\nIn 1934, five years after the establishment of the British company, Jack Kapp started the American branch of Decca. The new label released its first product in the middle years of the Great Depression, and tried to appeal to cost-conscious consumers by selling records for a mere 35 cents each. The first recording artist signed by Kapp for the new label was Bing Crosby. Crosby became a major star by the end of the 1930s. Soon Kapp had also signed such celebrities as Guy Lombardo, Ted Lewis, Ethel Waters, the Dorsey Brothers, the Mills Brothers, the Casa Loma Band, and others. By 1946, Kapp\u2019s leadership and entrepreneurial skills transformed Decca into a thirty million dollar-a-year business.\n\nSuccess had its price. In 1959 American Decca had become so valuable it was purchased by the Music Corporation of America (MCA). Records with the Decca brand name appeared for a few more years, but soon this familiar label became part of recording history, at least in the United States. The label continued in Britain releasing, among other titles, the early hit recordings of the Rolling Stones."}, {"url": "https://thequietus.com/articles/24411-decca-records-junk-shop-classical-wagner-ring-cycle", "page_content": "Richard Wagner\u2019s utterly preposterous The Ring Of The Nibelung is a cycle of four operas ranging in length from two-and-a-half hours (opener Das Rheingold) to five (G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, its final part) and totalling 15. It features characters from Norse mythology \u2013 gods, water-nymphs, giants and dwarfs \u2013 and it\u2019s intended to be staged on consecutive nights, which has always proved to be a test of endurance for listeners. Tchaikovsky scored tickets for the 1867 premiere at the opera house Wagner built especially for it in Bayreuth, Bavaria, and later wrote: \u201cAfter the last notes of G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung, I felt as though I had been let out of prison.\u201d Parts of it bored him and he thought some of the music was \u201ctoo complicated and artificial\u201d, but he was nonetheless impressed, noting that it contained \u201cmany passages of extraordinary beauty\u201d and was \u201can epoch-making work of art\u201d. That combination of views is pretty much how all but the most hardcore Wagnerians think of The Ring today.\n\nIf the prospect of listening to even one part of the cycle feels intimidating, imagine what it takes to record the work in full. No one had attempted to do so before British label Decca began the arduous process in Vienna in 1958. There had been live recordings of all 15 hours and a couple of radio broadcasts, but no meticulously crafted, studio version that respected every eccentricity in the 2,000-page score and made trailblazing use of the then-new technology of stereophonic sound to boot. By the time the producer of the project, John Culshaw, had captured the final notes on tape it was 1965. He hadn\u2019t been working on The Ring exclusively, but it was still the most ambitious and risky experiment in the history of the record business at the time. It birthed 38 sides of vinyl split into four boxsets (one for each of the operas, released sporadically across the seven years), as well as single-vinyl highlights albums, like the one at the top of this article, of excerpts from Das Rheingold and Die Walk\u00fcre.\n\nCulshaw must have wondered what was going on in the world when he finally came up for air. In 1958, Vera Lynn was the biggest act on Decca; by 1965, it was The Rolling Stones. A revolution in culture had taken place, leaving, you\u2019d imagine, appetites for bombastic 19th century German opera severely diminished. Not so. Culshaw\u2019s gamble \u2013 which featured a little-known Hungarian called George Solti (pictured below, left, with Culshaw) conducting an orchestra initially unfamiliar to him, the Vienna Philharmonic, and a lead soprano, Kirsten Flagstad, who had to be lured out of retirement \u2013 sold like a pop record. According to Norman Lebrecht\u2019s 2007 book, Maestros, Masterpieces & Madness: The Secret Life & Shameful Death Of The Classical Record Industry, it shifted 18m copies (a figure that presumably collects together sales of each of the four operas over the seven years), making it the best-selling classical album of all time. Others dispute that figure, saying that 1990\u2019s Carreras Domingo Pavarotti In Concert (re-released as The Three Tenors In Concert) did better, but you get the point \u2013 not only was Culshaw\u2019s The Ring a triumph of art (it\u2019s twice been voted the greatest classical recording ever made, in polls for Gramophone and BBC Music Magazine), it also ended up in the homes of millions of people who had never considered buying tickets for opera, or couldn\u2019t afford them. That was Culshaw\u2019s dream. \u201cThe sickness of opera is that it is a very expensive and exclusive closed shop,\u201d he wrote in a book about the recording.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another story here, too, of how The Ring made Decca\u2019s name as a classical music label. Or, more specifically, how it raised a middle finger \u2013 in a very British fashion, mind \u2013 to arch competitor EMI, and particularly their own in-house super-producer, Walter Legge, the self-proclaimed \u2018Pope of Recording\u2019 who made a jaw-dropping 3,500 recordings for EMI and, as people used to say, a similar number of foes.\n\nIn 1962, producer George Martin signed The Beatles to EMI. Famously, Decca had already turned them down, but they bagged The Rolling Stones instead, creating in the public imagination a rivalry between the two companies. It certainly existed. George Martin\u2019s approximate opposite number at Decca, Hugh Mendl, once said of EMI that they had \u201call of the arrogance of the BBC without any of the education\u201d, although he was friends with Martin and initially wanted to work for EMI. The bitchiness extended to classical music. On the night before sessions for The Ring began, Legge bumped into Culshaw in Vienna and asked him what he was working on. \u201cVery nice. Very interesting,\u201d Legge said. \u201cBut of course you won\u2019t sell any.\u201d\n\nThese days, both EMI and Decca have been sucked up into gargantuan uber-record company, Universal Music Group, but rewind to the 1950s and the two companies had distinct personalities, attracting different types of staff. \u201cEMI was conservative, Decca radical; one British bulldog, the other slinky Siamese,\u201d wrote Lebrecht. \u201cEMI occupied a mansion in St John\u2019s Wood [Abbey Road Studios]. Decca\u2019s studios were eight bus stops north in Broadhurst Gardens, West Hampstead, an area thick with continental immigrants.\u201d\n\nThe companies had been founded two years apart \u2013 Decca in 1929, EMI in 1931 \u2013 but EMI grew to become the bigger enterprise. Under its umbrella in the 1950s were three separate powerhouse labels \u2013 Parlophone, HMV and Columbia \u2013 and, by the end of the decade, it had acquired Capitol Records as its North American subsidiary. Decca, on the other hand, although a major player, was run by a single man, Edward Lewis, for an astonishing 51 years, from the establishment of the company until 1980, when it was sold to PolyGram days before his death. It had more of the feel of an independent label, but nevertheless made huge inroads into the American market, first under the name Decca (Lewis sold off his American arm in 1937), then with a new label, London, which Lewis launched in 1947 to sell British Decca records in the US, and also to license American music for the UK. (To complicate matters more, Decca also had sub-labels and other lucrative licensing agreements, but let\u2019s try and keep this simple.)\n\nWalter Legge, above, was born in 1906, left school at 16 and started out at EMI\u2019s HMV in 1927 as a writer \u2013 of sleeve notes and for the company\u2019s monthly magazine. A natural musician, although he never wished to be one, he moved into record production, moonlighted as a critic for The Manchester Guardian, and also showed an aptitude for business. In the 1930s, with the entire industry taking a hit after the Wall Street Crash, he successfully pioneered \u2018subscription\u2019 recordings \u2013 proto-crowdsourcing, essentially, that ensured upfront funds were available to make records, and also brought in considerable profits.\n\nHe had brilliant ears, but terrible eyesight, and it prevented him from serving during the war. Cannily, he spent it directing the classical music side of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which put on concerts and programmed broadcasts for the troops. It was desk job, but one that allowed him to keep track of the exact whereabouts of Britain\u2019s best orchestral musicians (many of whom were in the safe haven of the RAF\u2019s symphony orchestra) and monitor their progress during the war years. Then, in one of music\u2019s great land grabs, and by \u201cinvesting every penny I\u2019d ever saved or inherited\u201d, he offered the cream of these musicians jobs in his own, new orchestra, the Philharmonia, which he founded in 1945 primarily as a recording outfit \u2013 a symphonic-sized, classical music version of The Wrecking Crew, if you like, or The Swampers, Muscle Shoals\u2019s house band.\n\nThis was quite a ruse. Because Legge owned the orchestra, EMI would have to pay him royalties on records they appeared on, and he\u2019d also been promoted to run the Columbia arm of EMI\u2019s operation, meaning he could commission his own players. But he wasn\u2019t done yet. To sell records, he needed famous conductors and singers, and suspecting \u2013 correctly \u2013 that there would be rich pickings of German and Austrian stars floating around in post-war Vienna lacking reliable work, he shot off to the still-occupied city in early 1946, this time to spend EMI\u2019s cash. Incredibly, he signed Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic between 1922 and 1945, his young rival, the fast-rising Herbert von Karajan, and a dozen quality vocalists, including the bombshell German soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.\n\nAll three were controversial characters. Schwarzkopf and Karajan had been members of the Nazi Party; Furtw\u00e4ngler never joined, hated them, but had stained his reputation by conducting concerts for their top brass. Legge, a Germanophile who liked to shock, didn\u2019t care. When Karajan started at EMI he was still banned from performing publically, so Legge argued \u2013 successfully \u2013 that studio work was a private business affair. Karajan and Furtw\u00e4ngler were subsequently cleared by tribunal; Schwarzkopf, below, became Legge\u2019s second wife and a British citizen in 1953.\n\nEffectively, Legge took extreme advantage of the chaos thrown up by the conflict to assemble an elite squad of musicians, ready to be guided by his supreme gift for production. He fully intended to dominate classical music recording in Britain for decades to come and, instincts sharpened by a penchant for benzedrine, he quickly proved to be a fierce competitor, even with EMI\u2019s other labels. As George Martin recalled in his 1979 book, All You Need Is Ears, if Legge heard that Parlophone were about to record a piece he believed might sell, he\u2019d bullshit them, say, \u201cAwfully sorry, old chap \u2013 I did that last month,\u201d and quickly summon Columbia\u2019s team.\n\nHe can\u2019t have imagined much of a challenger in Decca, the only other UK label to survive the war in decent shape. They had shown some chops for classical music in the 20s and 30s, releasing pioneering works by contemporary British composers like Frederick Delius and William Walton, but their core business was pop. When a 22-year-old John Culshaw first got a job at Decca in 1946, they had pianist Clifford Curzon, contralto singer Kathleen Ferrier and the composer Benjamin Britten on their books \u2013 all huge talents \u2013 but lacked a full roster of bankable stars and even an orchestra that could compete with Legge\u2019s crack Philharmonia. So, like EMI, they went on a signing frenzy, called up their \u00e9minence grise in Zurich, Maurice Rosengarten (nicknamed Uncle Mo, and something of a Walter Legge figure himself), and told him to get to work. He delivered in spades, securing the services of three orchestras \u2013 the expensive-but-superb Vienna Philharmonic, Amsterdam\u2019s Concertgebouw and Swiss conductor Ernest Ansermet\u2019s Orchestre de la Suisse Romande \u2013 as well as promising individuals, including a pianist with aspirations to conduct, George Solti.\n\nIn a very different way to Legge, Decca also had a productive war. Highly capable sound engineers from the label had served in the Royal Navy as technicians tasked with creating equipment that could detect and catalogue German submarines by their signature engine noise. They brought their expertise in what amounted to high fidelity back to Decca\u2019s studio, invented what became a trademark \u2013 full frequency range recording, or FFRR in short \u2013 and started releasing 78s that were miles ahead of the curve in terms of how good a record could sound. In the late-40s, they were quick off the mark to embrace the long-playing record; 10 years later they jumped on stereo. And this aptitude for, and love of, technology undoubtedly helped Decca to steal a march on EMI.\n\nNot only was Legge a technophobe, he worked for a company that was afraid of seizing the future. They were late on the LP, late on stereo, and they never learned their lesson, completely underestimating the massive financial opportunity that the CD offered record companies when it turned up on the market in 1982. It was a stuffy, hierarchical organisation, where, as you\u2019ll know from photographs of George Martin in the 60s, producers wore suits and most people worked banker\u2019s hours. Decca was different. The boss, Edward Lewis, had Catholic tastes, but under him there was a democratic, family atmosphere, leading to the staff base being dubbed \u2018the Decca boys\u2019.\n\n\u201c\u2018The boys\u2019 is how musicians talked about Decca \u2013 whether for its practical mechanics, its puerile idealism, or its preponderance of homosexual men at a time when gay love dared not speak its name,\u201d said Lebrecht. \u201cDiscretion was the norm for gay men in the arts, but Decca was a safe house, as out as it was possible to be. Gordon Parry [engineer on The Ring and countless other records], pink-blond and perpetually on the prowl, was flagrantly bisexual. In the Decca apartment above the Sofiensaal [where The Ring was recorded], he went pounding on bedroom doors at night crying, \u2018Come on beau! It\u2019s only a bit of mutual masturbation!\u2019\u201d (Legge, on the other hand, used to call gay men \u2018175ers\u2019 \u2013 a Nazi-favoured reference to Paragraph 175 of the German criminal code, which made homosexuality a crime.)\n\nThere are a couple of pre-stereo Decca recordings that have gone down in legend \u2013 the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande playing Stravinsky\u2019s Petrushka in the late-40s, and a 1955 album of the Vienna Philharmonic (and singers) performing Mozart\u2019s The Marriage of Figaro conducted by Erich Kleiber, father of Carlos, who I covered in a previous Junk Shop Classical column. They must have taken Legge by surprise, but he was also on top of his game at this period in time. Furtw\u00e4ngler said of their landmark 1952 recording of Wagner\u2019s Tristan And Isolde with the Philharmonia, \u201cMy name will be remembered for this, but yours should be,\u201d and, just last year, The New York Times posited that a 1953, Legge-produced double LP of another of his star signees, the Greek-American soprano Maria Callas, singing in Puccini\u2019s Tosca at La Scala in Italy was \u201cthe best opera recording ever\u201d, not John Culshaw\u2019s The Ring.\n\nCulshaw\u2019s era of excellence at Decca began after he returned to the label from a two-year sojourn at Capitol Records between 1953 and 1955. He\u2019s best-known for The Ring, but believed his greatest achievement was a 1963 recording of Britten\u2019s War Requiem, also a massive-seller. He clearly had a job for life at Decca, but he became irritated with the company in the mid-60s, concerned that it was losing its cavalier spirit, and went to work at the BBC in 1967 as its head of music programmes. He died in 1980, aged 55, of hepatitis. \u201cTo meet John Culshaw for the first time, quiet, charming, sharp-eyed but with no signs of aggressiveness about him, was to marvel that here was one of the two great dictators of recording art,\u201d wrote Gramophone magazine in their obituary. \u201cHe transformed the whole concept of recording.\u201d\n\nThe other dictator was Legge, and although the two men have been remembered as wildly different characters, they actually have much in common. Both started out as writers (Culshaw published two novels in the early-50s) and either might have said, as Legge did, \u201cI thought of myself as a man determined to achieve certain standards, and not to be deflected by anything, or anybody, from those standards.\u201d Legge also warred with his label, and in 1964 he sensationally tried to disband the Philharmonia. There was a stand-off with its music director, Otto Klemperer (Hebert von Karajan had left for German label Deutsche Grammophon in 1960), which Legge lost, so he resigned and left in his memoirs the following searing assessment of corporate culture in the record business: \u201cI am convinced that in the arts, committees are useless. What is necessary are people like Karajan, Culshaw and me; we know not only how to achieve the best artistic results but how to attract the public and carry out the whole operation with carefully chosen collaborators. Democracy is fatal for the arts; it leads only to chaos or the achievement of new and lower common denominators of quality.\u201d\n\nHe must have expected a big job after his reign at EMI \u2013 head of the Arts Council, perhaps, or running The Royal Opera House \u2013 but he didn\u2019t get one, nor was he ever formally honoured for his significant contribution to culture in the UK. Culshaw wasn\u2019t either, but Legge\u2019s wife Elisabeth Schwarzkopf became a dame in 1976, despite her Nazi past. She would constantly say that her husband \u2013 a self-made man \u2013 was stiffed by the British establishment, and EMI. They got their revenge on the latter, at least. Just before Legge died in 1979, he produced Schwarzkopf\u2019s final recordings, which were released in 1981 as To My Friends, an album on Decca Records."}, {"url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeccaRecords", "page_content": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DeccaRecords\n\n\"The supreme record.\"\n\nDecca Records is a British record label, founded in 1929 by Edward Lewis. After buying out several failing labels in the 1930s, the company found considerable success with names like Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, and Al Jolson, with an American branch soon established in 1934. British Decca was known as a pioneer in developing new sound recording methods, while American Decca was known for its many film soundtrack releases in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nWith World War II on the horizon, Lewis sold off the American branch of Decca. The two companies operated separately for the next decade or so; the UK branch marketed its records in North America as London Records, while distributing US Decca's output in Europe on the Brunswick label. This was similar to the relationship between EMI and Capitol Records, and Philips Records and Mercury Records.\n\nIn 1962, the British branch infamously turned down a young, up-and-coming band known as The Beatles. They did, however, eventually sign on what would become another one of the world's greats, The Rolling Stones. Ironically, the American branch did issue the \"My Bonnie\" single by Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers (a.k.a. the Beatles) the same year, making it the first Beatles release in the U.S.; it sold poorly and the few copies that survived are now true collector's items worth thousands of dollars.\n\nThe American branch of Decca bought controlling interest in Universal Pictures in 1952, before being merged with MCA Records in 1962. The British branch was purchased by PolyGram in 1980, which was in turn purchased by Universal Music Group in 1998, reuniting the two Decca labels for the first time since 1943. Sadly, a huge number of original Decca master tapes owned by UMG and stored at Universal Studios Hollywood were destroyed in a fire in 2008.\n\nToday, both branches of Decca are still owned by UMG, which retains ownership and distribution of the earlier Decca releases (except for the Rolling Stones' catalog, which is owned by Abkco).\n\nAlso see Deram Records, a sublabel of UK Decca/US London that evolved into an outlet for Progressive Rock and other \"underground\" genres of the 60s and 70s.\n\nNotable UK Decca Records artists pre-1998:\n\nNotable US Decca Records artists pre-1998:\n\nNotable Decca Records artists post-1998:"}], "John Loder worked as a sound engineer and producer at Decca.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/19/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries", "page_content": "I first met the sound engineer and record producer John Loder in about 1968. He was on an acid trip and seemed to be talking out of the top of his head. The next time I met him he was straight and made a lot more sense. We soon found that we shared. a common interest in Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, John Coltrane, and KarlHeinz Stockhausen. When we got bored with them, we would play birdsong forwards and Bach backwards.\n\nBy 1970 John, who has died aged 59, and I were working together in Exit, an avant-garde outfit. I was the percussionist, playing an amplified bicycle wheel, and he was using an ancient one-track tape-recorder discovered in a friend's attic; primitive, but it was the beginning of what was to become John's lifework.\n\nFinanced by a brief spell as a mini-cab driver, by 1972 John had cobbled together an innovatory multi-track sound system, first used as a part of the wildly ambitious avant-garde International Carnival of Experimental Sound (ICES 72). By the time Exit disbanded in 1974, John had accumulated enough equipment to build a recording studio in the small garage of his north London home.\n\nDuring the next three years we lost touch, but by 1977 he was recording advertising jingles - which he didn't enjoy - and I had cofounded the band Crass, which I enjoyed thoroughly. From then on the ball started to rock and roll. As \"the ninth member of the band\", John became our recording engineer and financial manager: the music was bad and so was the money, but it was fun.\n\nWithin a couple of years Crass albums were dominating the alternative charts, and John's garage had become Southern Studios. In 1979 we created Crass Records and, despite marketing our first single for 45p against John's warning that every copy would lose us 3p, we made money.\n\nWe were in business, and from the outset it was clear that the music industry was not well pleased; John was a maverick, a DIY champion who didn't play the game. In his philosophy, beautiful came before big: to the last he drove a wreck of an old van, and never considered moving his garage studio to a more \"desirable\" location.\n\nLikewise, attempts to buy him out failed, just as media attempts to denigrate Crass had no effect on its growing popularity. Crass Records became the label that every aspiring punk band looked to, Southern Studios their destination, and John their engineer of choice.\n\nThroughout that time, with scores of bands being released on the label, no contract was ever signed and no paperwork ever thrust in faces. It was all done on trust, a principle that John held dear throughout his life. And it was John's managerial, production and engineering skills which were to assist the likes of Crass, Bjork, Chumbawamba, Fugazi, Shellac, The Jesus And Mary Chain, Slint and Babes In Toyland into the public domain,\n\nBorn near Plymouth, educated at a boarding school that he didn't like, John studied electrical engineering at London's City University. Details of his early history are brief because he didn't like talking about himself. John was one of those people who appears to have been born on their 20th birthday.\n\nFor every band that made it on to Crass Records, 10 were turned away. Crass's ideology was uncompromising and, as John felt, many good bands were losing the chance of public exposure. As a response, in partnership with his artist wife Sue, he created several labels and Southern Distribution, to ensure that they found a market. Aided by a small team to whom John was devoted, Southern grew into the international force that it is today.\n\nJohn resisted many attempts over the years to rein him in; as other independents collapsed, Southern survived, as majors conglomerated and became increasingly bland, Southern remained a vibrant voice in the wilderness. When bands got too big for their boots or managers began to burn his ears, John would suggest they go elsewhere. In the truest sense, Southern was a cottage industry, it placed people before profit.\n\nMedia requests for interviews with John always drew a blank, he displayed a reticence which extended even to his closest friends. For that reason very few people were aware that during the last 18 months he had been battling with a brain tumour which finally killed him.\n\nBut just as John's studio has become legendary, so has his insistence that quality of product should come before quantity: his angle, small is beautiful, was the big idea.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sue, and daughter, Natasha.\n\n\u00b7 John Loder, record producer, born April 7 1946; died August 12 2005."}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/john-loder-mn0000238526/biography", "page_content": "Producer and engineer John Loder founded the landmark Southern Studios and its accompanying record label and distribution network, all potent forces in the emergence and continued longevity of post-punk.

He was\n\non an acid trip and seemed to be talking out of the top of his head. The next time I met\n\nhim he was straight and made a lot more sense. We soon found that we shared. a\n\ncommon interest in Jimi Hendrix, Frank Zappa, John Coltrane, and KarlHeinz\n\nStockhausen. When we got bored with them, we would play birdsong forwards and\n\nBach backwards.\n\n\n\nBy 1970 John, who has died aged 59, and I were working together in Exit, an\n\navant-garde outfit. I was the percussionist, playing an amplified bicycle wheel, and he\n\nwas using an ancient one-track tape-recorder discovered in a friend's attic; primitive,\n\nbut it was the beginning of what was to become John's lifework.\n\nFinanced by a brief spell as a mini-cab driver, by 1972 John had cobbled together an\n\ninnovatory multi-track sound system, first used as a part of the wildly ambitious\n\navant-garde International Carnival of Experimental Sound (ICES 72). By the time Exit\n\ndisbanded in 1974, John had accumulated enough equipment to build a recording\n\nstudio in the small garage of his north London home.\n\n\n\nDuring the next three years we lost touch, but by 1977 he was recording advertising\n\njingles - which he didn't enjoy - and I had cofounded the band Crass, which I enjoyed\n\nthoroughly. From then on the ball started to rock and roll. As \"the ninth member of the\n\nband\", John became our recording engineer and financial manager: the music was bad\n\nand so was the money, but it was fun.\n\n\n\nWithin a couple of years Crass albums were dominating the alternative charts, and\n\nJohn's garage had become Southern Studios. In 1979 we created Crass Records and,\n\ndespite marketing our first single for 45p against John's warning that every copy would\n\nlose us 3p, we made money.\n\n\n\nWe were in business, and from the outset it was clear that the music industry was not\n\nwell pleased; John was a maverick, a DIY champion who didn't play the game. In his\n\nphilosophy, beautiful came before big: to the last he drove a wreck of an old van, and\n\nnever considered moving his garage studio to a more \"desirable\" location.\n\n\n\nLikewise, attempts to buy him out failed, just as media attempts to denigrate Crass had\n\nno effect on its growing popularity. Crass Records became the label that every\n\naspiring punk band looked to, Southern Studios their destination, and John their\n\nengineer of choice.\n\n\n\nThroughout that time, with scores of bands being released on the label, no contract\n\nwas ever signed and no paperwork ever thrust in faces. It was all done on trust, a\n\nprinciple that John held dear throughout his life. And it was John's managerial,\n\nproduction and engineering skills which were to assist the likes of Crass, Bjork,\n\nChumbawamba, Fugazi, Shellac, The Jesus And Mary Chain, Slint and Babes In\n\nToyland into the public domain,\n\n\n\nBorn near Plymouth, educated at a boarding school that he didn't like, John studied\n\nelectrical engineering at London's City University. Details of his early history are brief\n\nbecause he didn't like talking about himself. John was one of those people who\n\nappears to have been born on their 20th birthday.\n\n\n\nFor every band that made it on to Crass Records, 10 were turned away. Crass's\n\nideology was uncompromising and, as John felt, many good bands were losing the\n\nchance of public exposure. As a response, in partnership with his artist wife Sue, he\n\ncreated several labels and Southern Distribution, to ensure that they found a market.\n\nAided by a small team to whom John was devoted, Southern grew into the international\n\nforce that it is today.\n\n\n\nJohn resisted many attempts over the years to rein him in; as other independents\n\ncollapsed, Southern survived, as majors conglomerated and became increasingly\n\nbland, Southern remained a vibrant voice in the wilderness. When bands got too big\n\nfor their boots or managers began to burn his ears, John would suggest they go\n\nelsewhere. In the truest sense, Southern was a cottage industry, it placed people\n\nbefore profit.\n\n\n\nMedia requests for interviews with John always drew a blank, he displayed a reticence\n\nwhich extended even to his closest friends. For that reason very few people were\n\naware that during the last 18 months he had been battling with a brain tumour which\n\nfinally killed him.\n\n\n\nBut just as John's studio has become legendary, so has his insistence that quality of\n\nproduct should come before quantity: his angle, small is beautiful, was the big idea.\n\n\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sue, and daughter, Natasha.\n\n\n\nPenny Rimbaud\n\nFriday August 19, 2005 The Guardian\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.howold.co/person/john-loder-sound-engineer/biography", "page_content": "John Loder Biography\n\nMusical artist\n\nJohn F.

American musician and recording engineer Steve Albini (member of Big Black and Shellac), has spoken highly of Loder and described him as a critical influence:\n\nWhen I was in Big Black we did a session with him, and I thought he was a terrific engineer. He showed me the potential for getting the most out of the equipment without making the equipment the focus of attention. He knew how to do things quickly and with great sensitivity to the band, and had a complete working knowledge of his equipment. In any situation he could snap his fingers and do the right thing, because he knew exactly how things worked and what to do.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Loder established a television production facility at Southern.
