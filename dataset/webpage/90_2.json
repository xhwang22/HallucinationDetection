On the other side there is a large chunk of public opinion in the third world that does not agree with this perspective.\n\n\u201cThere are two paths. A path of connectivity and cooperation of which the leading example is BRI. It brings together corridors, cultures and connectivity. The other path is conflict and confrontation,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Mushahid Hussain Syed, the world can no longer afford conflicts, a new Cold War, or any policies of containment. \u201cLet us build a better peaceful prosperous future together because the challenges acquire collective approach.

The Conference brought together political leaders, government entities, entrepreneurs and think tanks on a single platform, to discuss prevailing issues and impediments in executing the initiative and instituting RDI as a think tank dedicated to promoting policy research on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The delegates from participating countries achieved complete consensus to make RDI functional. Besides China, the think-tank will have its official secretariat at Pakistan-China Institute in Islamabad.\n\nThe purpose of establishing RDI is to pool resources and expertise from various think tanks, government entities, global consultancy firms, political parties and media outlets to collaborate on issues of mutual interest through an effective platform to ensure coordination and swift communication.\n\nAn initial work plan for the think tank has been drafted and is presently under review. Research and Development International aims to formulate a China-Pakistan Experts Panel comprising of political leaders, researchers, business entrepreneurs and consultants. The panel, co-chaired by Senator Mushahid Hussain and Madam Zhao Baige, would provide consultation and related services on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor in particular and the One Belt, One Road Initiative in general.\n\nRDI\u2019s primary research areas would include infrastructural connectivity, Economic and Trade Cooperation, Industrial Investment, Energy and Resource Exploration, Financial Cooperation, Social Development Cooperation and Ecological Cooperation. RDI would also introduce a series of conferences on the \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 Initiative and would function as a platform for multilateral and bilateral collaboration for organizations around the globe. The think tank would also provide private companies an effective channel to communicate their concerns to regulatory bodies and related government agencies regarding private investments and public-private partnerships.\n\nThe Pakistan-China Institute, in collaboration with the Tsinghua University would also be introducing the initiative of establishing a China-Pakistan Information Corridor (CPIC) that would serve as a focal point for news and information regarding the Economic Corridor. The CPIC would aim to provide relevant and timely updates to media outlets, concerned governmental agencies, academicians and diplomats, among others.\n\nThis information corridor would also cater to publicity needs of other projects under the CPEC, including those on climate change. It would also aim at enhancing cooperation and coordination among news agencies from Pakistan and China. With the aim of keeping all stakeholders well informed, the dedicated website for the information corridor would take lead in disseminating pertinent news and key developments relating to the Economic Corridor. It will also deliver real time information services for investors from both countries in key areas of business development, marketing and human resource.\n\nWith significant initiatives in the pipeline, Research and Development International would assume a central role in spearheading research and development on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, with expertise from both China and Pakistan. The working group for the think tank will meet formally for the first time after its creation, in Pakistan, at the Pakistan-China Institute on 2nd June 2015, to discuss further the future course of action. The delegation will also engage in high-level meetings with the Prime Minister, Chief Ministers of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhawa and Punjab, as well as Federal Ministers for Planning and Finance."}, {"url": "https://issi.org.pk/report-1st-pakistan-china-think-tank-forum-evolving-regional-situation-and-pakistan-china-cooperation/", "page_content": "The China-Pakistan Study Centre (CPSC) at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) in collaboration with China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) hosted first webinar under Pakistan-China Think Tank Forum on September 8, 2021.

With a total consumption in 2020-21 of 121 billion kWh and electricity consumption per capita of 584 kWh, Pakistan is among those countries with lowest per capita consumption of electricity in the world. Against a total electricity generation of 143 billion kWh, the consumption represents, losses of more than 15 percent relative to total electricity generation. At the same time, provision of electricity at competitive rates to more than 24 percent population (still without electricity) is adding burden on the public- sector- run utilities to expand their infrastructure to remote areas of the country.\n\nDevelopment Prospects of Chinese Enterprises in Green Energy Industry in Pakistan\n\nPresently Pakistan is facing increasing pressure on its resources to provide affordable access of electricity to its population.

By traveling via the Silk Route we want to revive the traditional route and highlight its importance as well,\" he said.\n\nTurning to the think tank launched on October 1, 2009 to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Hussain said the institute focuses on efforts to further strengthen cooperation in the fields of defense and diplomacy, investment, trade and economy, energy, education, culture, youth and women, tourism, academia and media.\n\nAbout the recent steps the think tank has taken for promoting Pakistan-China relations, he said the Pakistan-China Institute has decided recently to launch the Pakistan-China friendship caravan, to establish a Pakistan-China scholar forum consisting of scholars from both sides, and to launch Pakistan-China research data base.\n\nHussain said it also decided to link up some Pakistani companies for the biggest Shanghai Expo running from May to October in the Chinese metropolis.\n\nThe think tank have engaged different coordinator and assigned duties to them in Karachi, Lahore and Gilgit-Baltistan in various fields like culture, tourism, education and other areas and activities with Pakistan-China friendship forum were also coordinated, he said.\n\nReferring to the current energy crisis in Pakistan, the think tank chief said Pakistan can invite Chinese companies to carry out geological surveys for coal mines, to prepare feasibility report and to dig for coal.\n\nHe cited his experience in Urumqi, Xinjiang, where China has developed a very sophisticated technology in wind power and solar power and suggested Pakistan learn from it. He said that China is a leader in cheaper sources of energy.\n\nOn China's role in South Asia and the role of Pakistan-China Institute, Hussain said that the joint statement issued by Chinese President Hu Jintao and U.S. President Barack Obama in Beijing last November is very positive as it seeks peace, stability and security in South Asia.\n\nHussain praised China's positive role in South Asia, its commitment to peace and its policy of non-intervention in internal affairs of any other states, saying \"China is the holder of universal principle, so we welcome China's role for peace.\"\n\nTo promote cooperation for the peace in the region, he said, the Pakistan-China Institute has a plan to organize a seminar in the third week of January in Islamabad, and to invite Chinese scholars for another seminar in June.\n\nHe termed China's investment in Pakistan as unique, saying that the investment has been long-term and strategic. He said it has helped the people of Pakistan in different areas, and it contributed to transfer of technology but there have never been conditions attached whether it's the heavy industrial complex in Taxila, near Islamabad, Gwadar port, a newly-built port in the south, or Zong mobile.\n\nThe Pakistan-China Institute is the first non-governmental, non-party and non-political organization with equal number of experts, scholars and intellectuals from China and Pakistan.

Established in May 1951, diplomatic ties between the two neighboring states has transformed into a strong friendship and partnership encompassing various areas of cooperation. Both sides, adhering to the norms of sovereignty, formed a strong bond as they sought to assert their role in regional and international arenas. Pakistan faced two full-scale wars in the early decades (in 1965 and 1971) and received critical and much-needed support from China, which cemented the bilateral relationship. China\u2019s support for Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, notwithstanding its changing stance on the dispute, and its decision to fund infrastructure projects in the disputed areas exhibited the depth of its partnership with Pakistan.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Beijing and Islamabad broadened their ties by agreeing to develop Pakistan\u2019s Gwadar Port and signing a free trade agreement in 2006. The 2015 launch of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), strengthened their economic ties. Bilateral trade rapidly increased after the signing of CPEC. Although the fanfare that marked early years has been missing from the CPEC discourse in recent Pakistani and Chinese commentaries, and there are indications of differences between the two, leaders on both sides have unequivocally rejected claims of rifts on questions of alignment, bloc politics, and regional issues.\n\nThe emergence of a new discourse about rifts in China-Pakistan relations owes to the slow growth of CPEC-based infrastructure projects during the past few years, the rise in terrorism, and political instability in Pakistan. Despite Islamabad\u2019s renewed rhetoric of amplified cooperation, the slow growth of infrastructure projects of CPEC remains evident. Various indicators show that Pakistan cannot afford infrastructure loans due to persistent political crises and a weak economy.\n\nSimilarly, China is also facing a decline in economic growth, which poses grave implications for CPEC, the flagship project of BRI. Simply put, Beijing may not be able to afford to replicate its past largesse. Despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s request during his visit to China in November 2022 for a rollover of $6.3 billion in debt, there was no indication from the Chinese authorities that they were ready to agree. China\u2019s slow response and the delay in finalization of the 11th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting minutes led many China-Pakistan watchers to argue that the relationship had descended to the level of \u201cvague and broad commitments\u201d devoid of concrete actions.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nBesides the economic factor, China\u2019s concerns regarding the revived surge in terrorism and extremism in Pakistan remained evident. December 2022 saw an 88 percent increase in terror activities across the country. Some terror attacks directly targeted the Chinese nationals residing in Pakistan (specifically teachers at a Confucius Institute in Karachi and workers at a dental clinic in Karachi). The Chinese authorities expressed serious concerns regarding these attacks and the safety of their nationals in Pakistan.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nAfter the visit of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to Beijing in May 2022, when the official statement from China\u2019s Foreign Ministry stated that China and Pakistan would enhance counterterrorism and security cooperation. Some reports emerged that the Chinese authorities wanted boots on the ground to protect their nationals in Pakistan.\n\nThe developments in the following months show that despite speculations and conjecture, the China-Pakistan partnership remains resilient, and the evidence of rifts undermining their enduring cooperation remains inadequate. The historical foundations and the contemporary developments, rooted in mutual trust and shared strategic interests, serve as the pillars of continuity. China\u2019s eventual decision to roll over a $2 billion loan to help Pakistan cope with the persisting economic crisis depicts the Chinese stance on their all-weather partnership with Pakistan.\n\nChina and Pakistan have collaborated on economic grounds for decades, primarily through CPEC in recent years, showcasing a multifaceted and comprehensive partnership. Credited by President Xi Jinping as the \u201cflagship project\u201d of China\u2019s BRI, CPEC encompasses energy projects, infrastructure development, industrial cooperation, and trade enhancement. The megaproject aims to connect China\u2019s northwestern Xinjiang region to Gwadar port in southwestern Pakistan via a vast network of roads and railways. CPEC\u2019s economic benefits are far-reaching: It can transform Pakistan\u2019s economy, create massive job opportunities, and enhance regional connectivity and development. The unprecedented amount of foreign direct investment (FDI) under CPEC has the potential to significantly improve Pakistan\u2019s economy. CPEC is far from perfect, but Pakistan\u2019s economic and political circumstances during the last decade should also inform the critical appraisal of the project.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverall, Chinese investments in infrastructure and energy projects in Pakistan have positively impacted the country. Under CPEC, numerous infrastructure projects have been initiated \u2013 including motorways, railways, and ports (six of them already completed, five under construction) \u2013 facilitating connectivity both within the country and with bordering regional states. The injection of Chinese investment has helped Pakistan cope with the chronic energy crisis by facilitating major energy projects. According to the CPEC website, 14 of these projects have been completed, contributing over 12,000 megawatts of electricity.\n\nAlthough there is significant criticism of the slow development of industrial and special economic zones (SEZs) via Chinese assistance, some of the bottlenecks have been overcome. The Punjab government has allotted lands in most of the local zones. Therefore, the SEZs and industrial parks of Punjab and Sindh may spearhead the initiatives in this regard. Nonetheless, of all major areas of cooperation, economic collaboration is relatively underexplored, and it may take more time and joint effort to flourish.\n\nOn the other hand, the most important domain of bilateral cooperation \u2013 security \u2013 has witnessed extensive collaboration in recent years. Pakistan and China are reliable partners with a strong alignment on military cooperation and key strategic issues in regional security and counterterrorism. They have a strategic partnership based upon recognizing the importance of a stable and secure regional environment.\n\nThis close partnership can be witnessed by the statement of the former army chief of Pakistan, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, at a ceremony marking the 95th anniversary of China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, held at General Headquarters, Rawalpindi. Bajwa stressed the importance of the China-Pakistan military partnership by characterizing the PLA and Pakistan Army as \u201cbrothers in arms\u201d that work together to safeguard \u201cour collective interests.\u201d\n\nChina plays a crucial role in maintaining a balance of power in South Asia. Pakistan is the largest recipient of Chinese arms, acquiring almost 40 percent of Chinese arms exports. In terms of military collaborations, military interactions between China and Pakistan during 2017 and 2021 surpassed China-Russia military engagements, making Pakistan\u2019s military the top collaborator with the PLA during this period. These collaborations include joint exercises, defense cooperation, and the exchange of military technologies and expertise.\n\nChina\u2019s renewed support for Pakistan\u2019s stance on critical matters like Afghanistan and the Kashmir dispute underlines a close alignment in shared interests. Its immediate call for a U.N. Security Council meeting in 2019 upon Pakistan\u2019s request, after border escalations and air skirmishes occurred between India and Pakistan, embodied China\u2019s \u201cunlimited support\u201d for Pakistan in the United Nations.\n\nThe recent visit of Foreign Minister Qin Gang to Pakistan in May 2023 to attend the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan foreign minister dialogue also underlines the importance China attaches to Pakistan and stability in its neighborhood. China\u2019s mediating role in the Middle East and its willingness to engage the Taliban regime by integrating it into Beijing-led regional economic frameworks indicate that China wants a stable and prosperous Pakistan to become a regional hub that can check India\u2019s hegemonic aspirations and secure Chinese interests in the region.\n\nEnjoying this article?

Its value for China as a tested partner and capable military power has increased in the face of growing pressure from the U.S.-led allies and growing collaboration between India and the United States. Amid these challenges, minor rifts between China and Pakistan, which do not affect China\u2019s national security interests, would not impact the trajectory of their bilateral relations."}, {"url": "https://issi.org.pk/press-release-2nd-pakistan-china-think-tank-dialogue/", "page_content": "PRESS RELEASE\n\n2nd Pakistan-China Think Tank Dialogue\n\nDecember 23, 2020\n\nChina-Pakistan Study Center (CPSC) at the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) hosted Second Pakistan-China Think Tank Dialogue via videoconferencing on December 23, 2020.

A total of 16 pairs of sister cities have been established between the two countries, whose cooperation officials and scholars believe will enhance the people-to-people exchanges in various industries and education.\n\nPakistani Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque met with Gong Zheng, mayor of Shanghai, on Wednesday in Shanghai Photo: Courtesy of Pakistan Embassy in Beijing\n\nPakistani Ambassador to China Moin ul Haque met with Gong Zheng, mayor of Shanghai, on Wednesday in Shanghai, and discussed further enhancing bilateral cooperation in the fields of economy and trade, education, science and technology.Gong briefed the ambassador on Shanghai's successful control and prevention measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and the revival of the city's economic growth to pre-pandemic levels. He highlighted that Shanghai will play its role as a bridge between the two countries to further strengthen bilateral relations.Haque expressed satisfaction at the growing ties between Pakistan and Shanghai in diverse fields. Shanghai will be one of Pakistan's key partners in its ongoing development. Haque called for further enhancing mutual cooperation between the two sides and welcomed more enterprises from Shanghai to invest in Pakistan especially in special economic zones under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).Besides Shanghai, Haque has visited other cities including Qingdao, one of the sister cities, in April.In the same month, at a new book release ceremony, Haque talked about his trips to different cities in China. \"At every stop, people warmly welcomed me and they'd say 'our iron brother' is here,\" he remarked.\n\nA gerenal view of Gwadar Port in southwestern Pakistan Photo: VCG\n\nShahida Wizarat, a professor and dean at the College of Economics and Social Development at the Institute of Business Management, a private university and business school based in Karachi, Pakistan, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the city level cooperation between China and Pakistan is progressing, although these two years were difficult due to COVID-19 in both the countries.\"I think sister cities project can be used to promote economic, political, social, and cultural ties between Pakistan and China. This would include promoting trade and investment, cultural exchanges, exchange of athletes, exchange of local government officials, [and] building linkages between universities of the two countries,\" she said in an email.Lin Songtian, president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, said that the two countries have established 16 pairs of sister cities so far to promote bilateral economic, social, investment, trade, and cultural exchanges, and cooperation.Lin noted in a media interview that \"in 2019, we held a cooperation forum between the two countries' sister cities. The results were gratifying, which enhanced friendly exchanges between the sister cities and promoted mutually beneficial cooperation. In the future, we will continue to promote this institutionalization.\"On January 27, Lin met with Haque, agreeing that this year is worthy of grand celebration and commemoration.Both are willing to take this as an opportunity to strengthen friendly exchanges and mutually beneficial cooperation in the areas of local governments, sister cities, media, think tanks, and the youth between the two countries.\"This will help to respond to the challenges that both these countries are faced with. For example, fifth-generation war has been unleashed and without knowledge of science and technology we will not be able to respond to these challenges,\" Wizarat added.\"Pakistan can learn how to respond to COVID-19 from China, who was able to contain and eliminate the virus successfully.\"Pakistan and China have established defense and strategic cooperation to mutual benefit, resulting in the production of the JF 17 Thunder aircraft, which is a state-of-the-art aircraft in great demand internationally.\"We admire Chinese remarkable successes in science and technology resulting in China landing on Mars. My congratulations to the Chinese leadership and the people on this remarkable achievement! We would like to benefit from Chinese space technology, artificial intelligence, drone technology, [and] nanotechnology,\" Wizarat said.The sister city project has great potential to increase interpersonal exchanges. Take for example the twin cities Urumqi, the capital city of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi. Urumqi is the Belt and Road Initiative's (BRI) core location and its relationship with Karachi can be used to promote tourism.Urumqi is very cold in winter and pleasant during summer. Karachi is very pleasant during winter and quite hot and humid during summer. Tourists from Urumqi can go to Karachi for holidays during winters, while tourists from Karachi can go to Urumqi for holidays during summers.Meanwhile, she said that interpersonal exchanges between Karachi and Urumqi can also be enhanced through establishing academic linkages between universities in Karachi and Urumqi. There are several universities, medical and dental colleges, business management institutes, social sciences universities, which can establish linkage programs with their counterpart institutions in Urumqi for the mutual benefit of the two cities."}, {"url": "https://www.ips.org.pk/the-conduct-of-pakistans-foreign-policy-2018-20-pakistan-china-relations-part-4/", "page_content": "Power Blackouts: A Fluster Issue of Pakistan This policy brief provides an overview of the power sector in Pakistan while focusing on the issue of power... read more\n\nPakistan mai research ka ahwaal Allah Almighty has blessed Pakistan with immense natural and mineral resources.
