The NGBL was organized as a professional softball league in 1944 to keep the best players from migrating to the All-American League which was established in 1943. Nonetheless, Twi was one of those who transferred to the AAGPBL despite the NGBL\u2019s best efforts. She signed up to play for the Grand Rapids Chicks in 1945 and continued to be a member of the AAGPBL through the 1950 season.\n\nA solid defensive player, who routinely ranked among league leaders in fielding percentage, Twi was a starter in left field or first base in every game from 1945 to 1950 with few injury-related exceptions. In 1946 she led the league in runs with 78. In 1947, she was a member of the champion Grand Rapids Chicks. Her career totals included 274 runs, 429 hits, and 255 stolen bases. After leaving the AAGPBL, she remained active in sports, played a couple of more years in the NGBL, and enjoyed golf, hiking, and aerobics.\n\nTwi studied at Illinois State Normal and Indiana University and immediately landed a job as a physical education teacher at South Bend\u2019s Washington High School where she inspired kids for nearly 30 years. She also coached the school\u2019s softball and volleyball teams to several city championships.\n\nThose who knew Twi said she had a good sense of humor, civic pride, and was a joy to be around. South Bend Bat Girl, Ruth Davis, a longtime friend of Twi\u2019s who also taught high school in South Bend for 25 years, noted that Twi had a \u201creal dry wit . . . but she was warm and giving. If she heard of someone in need, she was quick to act, but she didn\u2019t seek out recognition after helping people. She was quiet about her charity work, and many weren\u2019t aware of the extent of her involvement.\u201d\n\nDavis recalled that when Twi just turned 70, in 1990, she still referred to her work for Meals-on-Wheels for 15 years as \u201cTaking food to the old people.\u201d Davis also noted that Twi always had \u201ca young and inquisitive mind,\u201d and that \u201cShe took classes at the community college in South Bend while in her 60s just so she could learn.\u201d\n\nBetsy Jochum was an outfielder for the South Bend Blue Sox during Twi\u2019s tenure in the AAGPBL and later became a teacher in South Bend and a friend of Twi\u2019s. She remembered Shively as a fierce competitor. \u201cShe was a good ball player back in a time when women didn\u2019t play sports.\u201d\n\nTwi succumbed to four years of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and a year-long fight with lung cancer in a Douglas, Michigan nursing home on Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1999 at the age of 79. According to Gary Umphrey, another longtime friend who looked after Twi during her convalescence, she remained upbeat and lucid even as Alzheimer\u2019s and lung cancer beat her body down. \u201cShe was a sweet woman and I hated to see her uncomfortable,\u201d he said. About five days before she died, Umphrey was commiserating with her and said she defied the way Alzheimer\u2019s usually slurred her speech. \u201cShe opened her eyes, looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not all that uncomfortable.\u2019 And that truly was her spirit\u2014tough to the end.\u201d\n\nSOURCE\n\nCompiled from Twi\u2019s obituary and other articles about her in the South Bend, (IN) Tribune at the end of November and beginning of December 1999."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Twila_Shively", "page_content": "Twila I. Shively\n\nBats Right, Throws Right\n\nRight, Right Height 5' 6\", Weight 128 lb.\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\nTwila Shively played six years in the AAGPBL for three different teams.\n\nShe debuted in 1945 and hit .196/.280/.234 with 46 steals in 106 games for the Grand Rapids Chicks. She led AAGPBL outfielders with 234 putouts. She was also 5th in the league in steals behind Sophie Kurys, Helen Callaghan, Dottie Kamenshek and Shirley Jameson. She was 1 for 10 in the postseason. Her best season came in 1946, when she hit .247/.340/.296 with 75 stolen bases and 78 runs in 111 contests for the Chicks. She was third in outfield putouts (213), 4th in assists (17), tied for the lead in double plays (5) and 4th among starters in fielding percentage (.969). She also was among the offensive leaders in total bases (121, between Betsy Jochum and Thelma Eisen), hits (101, 9th between Eleanor Dapkus and Jochum, tied for 9th in doubles (9) and tied for third in runs (even with Kamenshek, trailing Kurys and Lib Mahon). In the playoffs, she was Grand Rapids' top hitter at .286 but they fell 3 games to 2 to the Rockford Peaches in the first round.\n\nShively batted .206/.266/.249 with 51 swipes in 1947. In the playoffs' first round, she was 4 for 17. In the finals, she was only 4 for 24 but stole a team-high 8 bases as Grand Rapids beat the Racine Belles in 7 games. In 1948, she was reassigned to the Chicago Colleens, a new team. The AAGPBL executives thought she would be a big draw because she had played with the Rockolas for the National Girls Baseball League in Chicago in 1944. She resented the move, liking her Grand Rapids club. She didn't even finish up 1948 in Chicago, also playing for the Peoria Redwings, and producing far below her 1945-1946 level at .156/.302/.190 with 36 steals.\n\nMoving to first base with Peoria in 1949, the Decatur native made 35 errors and hit only .187/.304/.222 with 18 steals. She ended up with the 1950 Redwings at .192/.287/.252 with 29 stolen bases, returning to her traditional outfield spot. Overall, she had hit .200/.296/.244 with 255 steals and 274 runs in 614 games.\n\nAfter her playing days, she was a physical education teacher and coach (softball and volleyball) at Washington High School for 30 years. She later was a volunteer for Meals on Wheels. She died due to complications from Alzheimers."}, {"url": "https://andscape.com/features/black-tennis-history-timeline/", "page_content": "Black Tennis Week A celebration of African-Americans in tennis\n\nThe rich history of black people and tennis in the United States goes back close to 110 years.

She was previously tied for six with Clara Schroth Lomady, whose were won between 1945 and 1952 when the AAU was the sport\u2019s national governing body. Biles is now tied with Alfred Jochim (1925-1930; 1933) for most by any American.\n\nThe 24-year-old Biles has won every all-around competition she\u2019s entered since the 2013 U.S. Championships.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really emotional, especially going into my second time doing an Olympic run,\u201d Biles told NBC\u2019s Andrea Joyce on NBCSN. \u201cIt\u2019s really crazy.\u201d\n\nAs she continues to gradually build up to the eventual defense of her Olympic all-around title, Biles has not been performing all of her most difficult skills, but has dominated nonetheless.\n\nOn both days of competition this week, she left out the double-double balance beam dismount named after her and the Yurchenko double pike vault she was the first woman to perform when she debuted it at U.S. Classic two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to do it at Trials,\u201d she told media of the vault. \u201cI didn\u2019t do it at this competition because on Wednesday I jammed my ankles and they didn\u2019t feel too good, so we just made a decision to not do it and not rush it so that I wouldn\u2019t be too, too nervous.\u201d\n\nBiles had the highest combined scores on beam, floor exercise and vault; this is the fourth time she has won three or more event titles at nationals.\n\n\u201cI feel like every single championship stands out for a different reason, but this one stands out specifically because it\u2019s the road to Tokyo,\u201d Biles said.\n\nHer floor routine, which includes two eponymous skills, is so far ahead of the rest of the field that Biles went out of bounds four times between both routines and still won that title by 1.5 points. She showed improvements on Sunday though, only going out of bounds once and scoring 0.3 more than Friday. Her all-around score was also 0.55 points higher on day 2.\n\nTrailing Biles by 4.7 points was Suni Lee, runner-up in 2019 as well, with a 114.95 total, followed closely by Jordan Chiles\u2018 114.45 points. Biles has won five of her national titles by a margin greater than four points.\n\nLee competed all-around for the first time since the 2019 World Championships, where she won silver on floor and bronze on uneven bars. She missed two months of training in 2020 when she broke a bone in her left foot, then another two months for left Achilles problems. The 18-year-old won her second national title on bars this week.\n\n\u201cI think this is a really good confidence booster because I wasn\u2019t even at my full potential on floor, and obviously my vault could have been a little better and today my bars was a little rough,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt definitely helps my confidence because I know I don\u2019t have to be 100 percent to be in the top with Simone, so I\u2019m really proud of myself.\u201d\n\nChiles, 20, is having a breakout year after placing sixth at the last nationals in 2019. A close friend and training mate of Biles\u2019 at World Champions Centre in Spring, Texas, she won the Winter Cup in February and was second to Biles at last month\u2019s U.S. Classic.\n\nShe said everything changed for her after moving from her hometown of Vancouver, Washington, to Texas in 2019 to train at Biles\u2019 gym under coaches Cecile and Laurent Landi.\n\n\u201cWhen I moved to WCC, I had the worst lack of confidence in my whole gymnastics career, and I think just having the proper coaching and the proper teammates that can support you through everything definitely helps throughout your whole gymnastics and even in your life in general,\u201d Chiles shared. \u201cI honestly can\u2019t thank Cecile and Laurent enough because they honestly are like the dopest people I\u2019ve ever met in my life, and it\u2019s crazy to see how I was in the past to now; I definitely can say my confidence is way better than it was back in the day.\u201d\n\nBiles has mentored and encouraged Chiles along the way.\n\n\u201c[After the meet] I told her that she had done it and she belongs here, and that we\u2019re going to go to [Olympic] Trials and do the exact same thing because this is what we trained for,\u201d Biles said. \u201cI\u2019m happy she got to go out there and show the world what she\u2019s capable of because she deserves it.\u201d\n\nOlympic Trials will take place in less than three weeks \u2014 June 24-27 in St. Louis, Missouri \u2014 after which four athletes will be chosen to compete in the team event in Tokyo with a fifth athlete competing solely as an individual.\n\n\u201cThe gymnast does not have to be an all-arounder,\u201d high-performance team coordinator Tom Forster said of the additional, individual athlete. \u201cOur goal is to provide our athletes with the most opportunities to win medals for themselves and for Team USA. We believe that we\u2019re going to have our strongest all-arounders on the team. \u2026 Whoever is really stepping up and showing the best potential for winning a medal or medals will earn that [individual] spot.\u201d\n\nWhile Biles, Lee and Chiles are all favorites to make the Olympic team \u2014 especially with the top two finishers at Trials automatically qualifying \u2014 the battle for the fourth team spot is tight.\n\nIn Fort Worth, fourth through ninth place were separated by less than a point.\n\nEmma Malabuyo finished fourth with 110.45 points \u2014 an impressive result for the 2017 U.S. junior silver medalist after her senior career had so far been marred by injuries; Malabuyo was seventh after Friday night\u2019s competition.\n\n\u201cClearly Emma Malabuyo was super impressive,\u201d Forster noted. \u201cShe came out of a very, very low position at the U.S. Classic, and it\u2019s great to see her back in her international form that she was in a couple years ago since she\u2019s wrestled with a couple injuries here and there. \u2026 There were a couple of surprises today but I\u2019d say she was the best surprise that we weren\u2019t expecting.\u201d\n\nLeanne Wong (110.15), Jade Carey (110), Skye Blakely (109.55) and Grace McCallum (109.55) complete the top eight, all of whom automatically qualified to Olympic Trials. 2016 Olympic alternate MyKayla Skinner is also squarely in that mix, placing ninth with 109.5 points, just 0.95 from fourth after all eight routines.\n\nCarey is the only American gymnast who has already secured a spot in Tokyo, which she did so by earning the maximum number of points on floor throughout the 2019-20 World Cup series. If she automatically qualifies for the four-person Olympic team at Trials (and chooses to accept that team spot), the U.S. will lose her individual spot and send one less gymnast to Tokyo.\n\nIt was announced after the competition that Skinner, Kara Eaker, Kayla DiCello, Shilese Jones, Emily Lee, Amari Drayton, Ava Siegfeldt, Addison Fatta, Zoe Miller and Riley McCusker were also invited to compete in St. Louis.

At the time she was hopeful for a return on day 2, but eventually withdrew from the meet altogether.\n\nHurd has had a rough time competing this spring since having her fifth and sixth elbow surgeries in March. She performed only beam and floor at both U.S. Classic and nationals, placing 26th and 23rd on the two, respectively, this week.\n\nMemmel, a 2008 Olympian, competed for the first time in nine years at the U.S. Classic. Now a 32-year-old mother of two, she returned to training gymnastics purely for her love of the sport and was eventually convinced to make a competitive comeback, which has inspired many. Memmel had the fifth-highest single vault score on day 1 and was 13th overall on beam. She fell on her Arabian on beam on day 2, and also fell off bars both days \u2014 an event she won the world title on 18 years ago.

It was the first NCAA doubles title for the university.\n\nFirst-year Elle Christensen won the 2022 NCAA Division III singles crown, then she joined with junior Tilly Rigby and took the NCAA Division III doubles title with two wins in the championship match, which ended at 11:40 p.m. It\u2019s the first time since 2017 that the singles and doubles national champions came from the same school.\n\nChristensen, unseeded in the 32-woman NCAA singles tournament field, defeated fourth-seed Angie Zhou from Pomona-Pitzer 6-4, 7-5 to win the championship. Zhou had only lost two games total in four previous NCAA matches entering the final.\n\n\u201cCompared to Boston, Florida was extremely hot throughout the tournament,\u201d said Christensen. \u201cGiven the heat, I tried to move my opponent side to side. She was playing a great match and the games were very close. I fought hard for every shot and tried to focus on one point at a time, especially on the crucial points.\u201d\n\nIn the 16-team doubles tournament, Christensen and Rigby\u2014also unseeded\u2014defeated number 2 seed Shianna Guo and Sylwia Mikos from Chicago 6-7 (3), 6-4, 7-5 in the semifinals and then Erica Ekstrand and Yuu Ishikawa from Williams College 6-1, 6-3 in the final.\n\n\u201cWe knew that our matches would be tough and that we had to do what we have been doing all season\u2014being consistent, making good decisions with every shot, and wanting the ball at net,\u201d said Rigby. \u201cWe play best when we are fired up and energized from the very start, and we did a good job of doing that every match.\u201d\n\nIn her first singles set in the finals, Christensen won a huge break point to go up 5-4 on Zhou and then swept through the final game to win 6-4. The two had gone back and forth earlier in the set, swapping break points early for a 2-2 score. Christensen\u2019s break in the ninth game would make the difference.\n\nAgain in the second set, Christensen won a huge break point to take a 6-5 lead. She had faced set-point in the previous game, but rallied to even the score at 5-5. She then won the break point and took the final game for a 7-5 win and the national championship.\n\nThe two opponents had traded a pair of break points to open the second set with a 2-2 score. Each held serve for the next four games for a 4-4 deadlock. After Zhou took a 5-4 advantage, Christensen held serve despite facing set point, then won a break point before finishing off the set and the match.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy,\u201d said Christensen of her victory. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d\n\nThis was the second NCAA singles title for Tufts women\u2019s tennis. Julia Browne won the Division III championship back in 2010.\n\nIn her quarterfinal contest, Christensen took down Mikos of Chicago\u2014the top seed\u2014by 6-3, 7-6 (3) scores. Then in the semifinal on May 28, she won over Ekstrand from Williams\u2014the defending NCAA singles champion\u20146-2, 7-6 (4).\n\nElle Christensen with her singles championship NCAA trophy.

The Tufts tandem faced Guo and Mikos from Chicago in the semifinals and lost the first set in a tie-breaker, but came back to win 6-7 (3), 6-4, 7-5.\n\n\u201cAfter a long day of playing tennis, late at night, Tilly and I played our finals,\u201d said Christensen. \u201cI\u2019m so fortunate to have such a great partner. I would like to thank my team, my coaches and everyone supporting Tufts tennis.\u201d\n\nThe Jumbo pair was down 4-2 and 5-3 in the first set before forcing the tie-breaker. Then after winning the second set to even the match, they endured a weather delay prior to the third set, fell behind 4-2 after play continued, but came back to win the match. They won four of the last five games to take the third set and the match.\n\nThat put them into the NCAA championship match against Ekstrand and Ishikawa, where they breezed through the first set 6-1. The second set was tied 3-3 before the Jumbos won the final three games to take the title.\n\nRigby, who dealt with a back injury all season, added that being a national champion \u201cis an amazing way to end a season filled with ups and downs. I\u2019m looking forward to coming back next year and winning it as an entire team.\u201d\n\nThese were the fifth and sixth national championships won by Tufts student-athletes during the 2021-22 academic year.

The 56th edition of the Championships \u2013 and 11th as a standalone Team Championships \u2013 were fiercely contested, with the hosts China continuing their domination of the sport. But when did China win its first medals? Which other teams dominate the Championships? When was the last time China did not win World Championships gold? Olympics.com takes a look at a brief history of the World Table Tennis Championships, and its all-time medal table. READ MORE: 2022 World Team Championships preview\n\nMusic | Tokyo 2020: Table Tennis\n\nBrief history of the World Table Tennis Championships The World Championships in table tennis were first held in London, England, in 1926, with men's and women's singles, men's and mixed doubles, and men's team events. Women's doubles were introduced at the second edition of the World Championships, held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1928, while the women's team event made its debut in 1934 in Paris, France. The team events formed part of every World Championships until 1997, after which they were split into individual and team events. Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, hosted the first World Team Championships in 2000, while Osaka, Japan, hosted the final combined World Championships a year later. Early editions were dominated by European countries, notably Hungary, before the People's Republic of China finally joined the Championships in the 1950s and began winning titles. The oldest trophy in table tennis is the Swaythling Cup, first awarded to the victorious men's team in London in 1926. The trophies for the other six events did not follow until 1929 and 1931 for singles, 1933 for the women's team, and the late 1940s for the three doubles events.\n\nMedal Moment | Tokyo 2020: Table Tennis Men's Singles (CHN)\n\nWorld Table Tennis Championships medals: Individual events Athletes representing Hungary won eight of the first nine men's singles world titles, and the first seven women's singles crowns, as the central European country exerted the early dominance. Ironically, the one gold they did not win was on home soil in Budapest in 1929, as Fred Perry \u2013 the English tennis player who also excelled at table tennis \u2013 claimed gold. China won the first of its gold medals in 1959 when Rong Guotuan claimed the men's singles title, but after a brief early spell of domination were set back by the Cultural Revolution in the country, which saw the team miss the 1967 and 1969 Championships. However, since their return, they have proven difficult to displace, especially in women's competition. Since the 1979 World Championships in Pyongyang, DPR Korea, only once has a non-Chinese athlete taken the women's singles world title \u2013 Korea Republic's Hyun Junghwa in 1993. There has also been Chinese representation on the top step of the women's doubles podium at every edition since 1977 except in 1987, when Hyun and Yang Youngja won gold. China leads the medal table in each individual event, with 21 men's singles, 24 women's singles, 18 men's doubles, 23.5 women's doubles, and 20.5 mixed doubles gold medals for a total of 107 golds. Hungary sits second all-time with 56 gold medals. The last time China failed to win an individual gold medal was at the most recent World Championships, when Sweden's Mattias Falck and Kristian Karlsson won the men's doubles title.\n\nCombined medal table: Singles and doubles In doubles events, teams may be made up of pairs representing two different nations. In this situation, a medal won by such a pair counts as half a medal for each participating nation. Additionally, athletes from both the Republic of Korea and DPR Korea represented a unified team at the 1991 World Championships.\n\nWorld Table Tennis Championships: All-time medal table (singles and doubles) Team Gold Silver Bronze Total People's Republic of China 107 93 159.5 359.5 Hungary 56 45 64.5 165.5 Japan 33 27 55 115 Czechoslovakia 19 27.5 46.5 93 Romania 12 5.5 13.5 31 England 11 20.5 41 72.5 Sweden 10 8 8.5 26.5 USA 7 1 15.5 23.5 Austria 6 7.5 28 41.5 Republic of Korea 3.5 7 27 37.5 DPR Korea 3.5 2 5 10.5 Yugoslavia 3 8 10.5 21.5 Germany 2 7.5 14.5 24 USSR 2 3 7 12 France 2 0.5 13 15.5 Chinese Taipei 1 2 5 8 Federal Republic of Germany 1 1 3 5 Scotland 1 1 1.5 3.5 Poland 0 3.5 3.5 7 Wales 0 1.5 2 3.5 Belarus 0 1.5 0.5 2 Unified Korea team 0 1 2 3 Belgium 0 1 1 2 German Democratic Republic 0 1 1 2 Croatia 0 0.5 2.5 3 Luxembourg 0 0.5 1 1.5 Spain 0 0.5 0 0.5 Hong Kong, China 0 0 13.5 13.5 Singapore 0 0 4 4 Egypt 0 0 2.5 2.5 Greece 0 0 1.5 1.5 Denmark 0 0 1 1 India 0 0 1 1 Portugal 0 0 1 1 Netherlands 0 0 0.5 0.5\n\nTable Tennis Women's Team | Highlights\n\nWorld Table Tennis Championships medals: Team events China has won each team event 22 times, taking its first title in 1961 on the men's side. Unlike in the individual events, China's recent stranglehold over the men's team event does not stretch back as far. Chinese teams have won 11 of the last 12 men's World Team Championship crowns dating back to the 1995 World Championships in Tianjin, with the streak being interrupted once by Sweden in 2000. They have also won 20 of the last 22 women's titles since winning gold in Kolkata in 1975, only losing in finals twice in that time \u2013 to a unified Korea team in 1991 and Singapore in 2010. As in the individual events, Hungary also features high on the list of title-winners in team events, but it's Japan who sit second behind China's 42, with a combined 15 gold medals.\n\nTable Tennis Men's Team | Highlights\n\nCombined medal table: Teams Athletes from both the Republic of Korea and DPR Korea represented a unified team at the 1991 World Championships. They competed separately at the 2018 World Team Championships but merged to form a single unified women's team in the quarter-final stage."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/32189839/joe-salisbury-desirae-krawczyk-win-mixed-doubles-title-us-open", "page_content": "NEW YORK -- Joe Salisbury won a US Open doubles title for the second time in two days and Desirae Krawczyk won her third mixed doubles Grand Slam title of the year.\n\nThe No. 2-seeded team beat Giuliana Olmos of Mexico and Marcelo Arevalo of Argentina 7-5, 6-2.\n\nIt was the second Grand Slam title this year for the pair, who also won the French Open.\n\nSalisbury teamed with American Rajeev Ram to win the doubles title Friday.
