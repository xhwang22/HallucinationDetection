The Texan, who rocketed away from the line, comfortably held off any attempts at an attack from Biaggi, then upped his pace to go on to take a solitary chequered flag. With this result Spies now has a 15-point advantage over Haga, who lost the front and crashed on lap 7 while making up time in fifth place. The runner-up slot went to Rea, who got the better of Biaggi after a terrific duel. The best Ducati rider to the line in fourth place was Shane Byrne, in one of his best races of the year, while fifth went to Michel Fabrizio (Ducati), who compromised his race with a bad start. Leon Camier had a good run to sixth for Aprilia, while Ruben Xaus finished eighth on the first BMW. Both Suzukis failed to finish, Yukio Kagayama crashing out and Sylvain Guintoli was forced to retire.\n\n\n\nBen Spies: \"It was actually a really tough race, at first I was just going for the win, getting to the front and not worrying about anything. Then when Haga was out I had to win to get as many points as possible for race 2. Once you have a gap, you don't want to be stupid and throw it all away.\"\n\n\n\nJonathan Rea: \"It took a little bit of time for my tyres to get right in but when they did they were good until the end. The team and the bike have been working really good and I can't thank them enough. It's the first time I've ever had such a result in race 1 and I'm sure in race 2 I'll be strong again.\"\n\n\n\nMax Biaggi: \"I didn't maybe have the chance to set up the bike the way I want and I had a few small problems, and then sometimes I made a few mistakes and this lost me some tenths. But I'm pleased with the result, even though I'm so sore from the accident yesterday and I didn't think I could do the whole distance.\"\n\n\n\nResults: 1. Spies B.

The American only had to finish sixth, but he preferred to shy away from any direct confrontation and together with Haga's second place, the result gave him the title by six points. Fabrizio scored his third win of the season after a terrific scrap with Rea, who took the final podium slot, while Shane Byrne was again a protagonist of the race and finished fourth. Biaggi looked spectacular on the track, but the Italian made several errors and could only finish in sixth, while team-mate Leon Camier ran another convincing race in seventh, ahead of Smrz (Guandalini Ducati) and Corser (BMW), while this time both Suzuki riders Guintoli and Kagayama finished in the points.\n\n\n\nBen Spies: \"First I've got to thank Yamaha for giving me everything I needed to win. It was really good, we did what we had to do and it was difficult to do that because the pace was quite fast and I saw that there were a couple of people behind me. I knew that if Nori won I had to be sixth, so I tried to stay out of trouble. It was spectacular, I can't thank Yamaha enough and everyone who's been behind me for my first year here. It'll sink in in the next couple of days!\".\n\n\n\nMichel Fabrizio: \"Both Jonathan and I showed that we're going to be up at the front next year and we're going to do a lot of these battles. I really wanted that win, Johnny made a mistake here at the last curve, maybe a gear slipped or something, and for me it was all OK. Just as well because otherwise it would have been difficult to overtake him.\"\n\n\n\nNoriyuki Haga: \"This weekend we had a problem with the rear tyre and in the first race we made a mistake with the tyre choice and I crashed. Second race was quite good, I was worried for the tyre life, but I started to push and I am happy for second position. Unlucky for today for the title but I try to do my best for next year and congratulations to Ben for the world title.\"\n\n\n\nJonathan Rea: \"With Michel I was racing for my own championship position and it seemed to be a little bit of a fight and I had to do something on the last lap to win the race and get fourth in the championship. I tried everything but made a mistake which allowed Michel to get past. But this is my best weekend of the season with a double podium.\"\n\n\n\nResults: 1. Fabrizio M.

The race win however went to Eugene Laverty (Parkalgar Honda), who did what he had to do and won but Crutchlow was impeccable in fourth and took home a well-deserved title. The runner-up slot went to Kenan Sofuoglu (Hannspree Ten Kate Honda), who finished the championship in third place, a result that was made easier by the retirement of his chief rival Joan Lascorz (Kawasaki Motocard.com). It was a good day also for Triumph, who saw Garry McCoy step onto the podium for the second time this year, and Chaz Davies finish in seventh. Fifth place went to Mark Aitchison (Honda Althea), who got the better of Michele Pirro (Yamaha Lorenzini), who scored his best result of the season.

For the Belgian rider, who has always been on the podium this year, it was the fifth win in ten races, a clear sign of his supremacy and that of Ducati, winners of the last three titles.

Another title win for the BMW S 1000 RR: French rider Sylvain Barrier was crowned champion at the season finale of the 2012 FIM Superstock 1000 Cup at Magny-Cours (FRA). For his BMW Motorrad Italia GoldBet STK Team it was the second title win in three years competing in the series, after the triumphant season with Ayrton Badovini (ITA) back in 2010.\n\nIn the season\u2019s ten races, 23-year old Sylvain celebrated four victories, which was more than any other rider. In total, the Frenchman rode his RR to six podium finishes and claimed seven pole positions. Over the course of the year, he also showed his spirit to never give up. He fought his way back to the top after a setback halfway through the season when he suffered a severe shoulder injury that put him a long way back in his title campaign. At the penultimate round two weeks ago at Portim\u00e3o (POR), Sylvain retook the lead by finishing the race in second. He arrived with an advantage of three points to his closest rival at the season finale on home soil. At the last race of the year he secured the title by claiming another podium and finishing second. The first to congratulate him straight after the finish line was his mentor, double Superbike world champion James Toseland (GBR).\n\n\u201cI still cannot believe I won the title,\u201d Sylvain enthused. \u201cThe hard work done with the team throughout the season has paid off and I want to thank the guys, my family, James, the Clinica Mobile and everyone who supported me during the year. It was a tough race, but I was feeling very comfortable on the bike from the warm-up. I rode very carefully on the first two laps because the rear tyre was not warmed up properly and also Eddi La Marra and Bryan Staring had already crashed. I tried to maintain the gap I had with the following riders and at the same I concentrated on making the tyres work properly and did not push to the limit.

Really, I love the track. Also, first time on the U.S. Dunlops. It was quite interesting. There was a lot of things to learn, a lot of things to have sensation with, but it\u2019s ok.

I know I can go faster for sure, easy, but I wasn\u2019t ready to do it today. I just want to take my time. The first days, even the first race is very important [to make] the base really strong to come back more stronger and more faster for the future.\u201d\n\nIn spite of it being his first visit to COTA, his BMW being closer to Superstock than Superbike spec (except for a set of \u00d6hlins forks and Hayes brake calipers), and him not using a qualifying tire at the end of the test, Barrier finished with a best lap time of 2:12.155, which ranked him 13thoverall and ninth among Superbike riders."}, {"url": "https://www.owlapps.net/owlapps_apps/articles?id=40760561&lang=en", "page_content": "Sylvain Barrier (born 20 October 1988 in Oyonnax) is a French motorcycle racer.

Having had no time to test before the first round at Aragon, the Frenchman was playing catch-up all weekend.\n\nHis prospects of a strong first showing aboard the new R1 weren't helped by a heavy spill on Saturday morning which required a subsequent hospital visit. Yet the 26-year old still managed a gritty eleventh place finish on Sunday while riding with several cracked ribs.\n\nBarrier spoke to Crash.net on Saturday evening at Aragon about his split with BMW, the potential for a Superbike return in 2016, and his new role as Michelin test rider.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nAfter losing your ride with BMW you've ended up back in the series you've won twice. Was it your first choice to return to the European Superstock 1000 class?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nI was looking honestly everywhere. BSB, IDM, everywhere. But I wanted to stay in the paddock of Superbike. I call every team in the paddock but everything was taken. There was quite some people who wanted to have me. The thing is I don't want to wait for a rider to crash, get injured and take his ride. For me it's not really correct. I prefer to go back to where I was. I'm doing some development for Michelin for the MotoGP. I'm in the Italian series with the same team. They give me the chance to maybe come into Superbike next year. But they say I need to fight. If everything come easy it's not my way to do things.\n\nYamaha gave me the chance to come back. Now it's in my side to give everything to show them and show me what I'm able to do. Also if one day I have children I can tell them what we need to do. I don't want to sit on the sofa when I'm 50 years old and say, 'Oh, if I did this I could be world champion.' No, [I have to] give everything and after show my children how to do it and how to be a better person.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nAre you still upset with BMW's decision?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nHonestly I think I can be a better person. When you stay for five years with the same team you don't feel lazy. You think, 'Ok, I'm here and everything is good.' But when this happens it gives you the feeling in the heart to battle. For sure this what they did was not the correct way to do things but it will help me to become a better person.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nDid you foresee the split with BMW?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nFrom the beginning of the year I was always saying the two first races will be quite difficult because Phillip Island I don't really like the circuit. After Thailand I didn't know the circuit. The first race was a complete disaster. In the second race I begin to enjoy on the bike. I was enjoying the qualifying. In the race I didn't have the good feeling to really push. The bike was quite good and I need to over-push. I wasn't feeling the confidence to do it. I thought, 'take this race easy, then in Aragon battle.' The bike is good and I wanted to battle. The team said, 'See you in Aragon.'\n\nBut when we come back from Thailand they didn't call me to tell me that. They called my manager and they say this to him. I am going out with my manager's daughter. He called his daughter and asked, 'Is Sylvain not professional?' But everything was fine. We understand the [ex-BMW WSBK] manager Andrea Dosoli go away and a new one comes. Also they say from the car accident last year, when I was not in contract with BMW at this moment, that it was bad for the image of BMW. We come back and finish some races second and third. Ok, I maybe was not battling with [David] Salom but I was in front of him in many race. I don't know exactly what happened. Maybe [Ayrton] Badovini is Italian, it is BMW Italia. I don't blame anyone. Just the way they did it is not really professional. They do it all [behind] the back and this is not really nice after five years.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nYou stood by BMW when they didn't provide you with a Superbike after your first Superstock 1000 title. Does that make their decision more difficult to accept?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nThe deal was you win the championship you go to Superbike [in 2012]. I win the championship and they take Davies and Melandri [for the 2013 season]. What is the plan? 'You go back to Superstock.' And after you will get a Superbike in a professional team. I was like perfect. I will do again. After two race or three race BMW take the decision to stop everything. I thought, 'For fuck sake!' I sign again for this for 'Evo'. We do 'Evo' and it was not what I expect. If this happen in your life it's for a reason. You need to take the best and try to grow up. It's what I do now. If I come back from now I will be much stronger and it will be much better for me.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nWhat are your first impressions of the new Yamaha R1?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nIt's completely a new bike and we didn't make any tests before we come here. On Monday I was under contract with BMW. We make all this at the last minute. We need to learn to the bike. Yesterday was a good day but we make the lap time with the new tyres. We didn't do anything else. We just put the new tyres and then try to understand the handling of the bike. The lap time was coming easy. This means the potential of the bike is really high. The bike is standard. It's Stock from the shop. We have the suspension. The session is really good. This morning I go with the tyres from the day before. I do three laps and come back in but the last thing I use for the second practice yesterday. We changed the spring on the bike. When I changed direction in the middle of the corner then the front is straight away go away because the track is a little bit cold. We only have four tyres all weekend. So it's difficult to imagine all that.\n\nAlso I was a little bit too aggressive. It's the game. But from the first time we get on the bike after two days we have one second free on people that are doing this for three months. It's not really bad. It means the bike is quite easy to ride straight away. We just need to understand more the bike.\n\nNow she's [the bike] the boss. I'm like 'ok'. We need to find a couple of things and it will be fine. But we need a little bit more time. The family of Yamaha is really great. Everybody we eat in the same hospitality. Everyone talk to everyone. It's intense competition but it's quite natural. This is quite nice.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nThe chance to race Yamaha's R1 in the World Superbike series next year is a nice incentive...\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nSuperbike was something else. I'm rider official for Michelin to develop the MotoGP tyres. I work with them for many years and they really like the way I speak about the tyres. I'm quite easy to live with and to do all the things. I think I will make a really good job. I don't know where it will bring us but for sure it will be fun.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nThe depth of quality in this class has significantly increased this year. Do you feel it will be harder to regain your title?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nI'm quite happy. Just one thing I think is, 'Why don't they fire me before?' I can make one or two test before this race and be much more stronger. Now I am quite limited but I need to take the race like a practice. This morning I was a little ambition more than talent, like Stoner said. I leaned over, get back the front, I said, 'Come back!' but it didn't listen. It was not good.\n\nCrash.net:\n\nYou suffered a fairly big fall on Saturday morning and were taken to hospital. What happened?\n\nSylvain Barrier:\n\nFor the crash I just lose the front and the bike come on me. We have the security here [on the handlebar] and my glove stay in. It brings me then the bike go up. It does a spin, it come on me and I was made to go to the hospital for checks. I have two ribs cracked. The shoulder is painful and the muscle [in the arm]. Honestly on the bike it's quite hard. But I can ride and this is a good thing."}]}
