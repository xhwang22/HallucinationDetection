The first issue appeared on Nov. 9, 1967, with John Lennon on the cover. The magazine\u2019s creators intended Rolling Stone to be a barometer of the artistic tastes and political sensibilities of the student generation. The magazine effectively combined passion and professionalism, using both proper English and \u201cstreet language.\u201d Many well-known writers and journalists, including Hunter S. Thompson, Cameron Crowe, Lester Bangs, and Greil Marcus, started their careers with Rolling Stone. As the magazine increasingly came to define significant trends and discerning taste in rock and pop music, appearances on its cover were coveted by established as well as up-and-coming musicians as emblems of critical success. Along with the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Madonna, and many other musicians, Rolling Stone\u2019s cover featured significant actors, writers, and politicians, such as Jack Nicholson, Susan Sontag, and Bill Clinton. In an effort to enhance its image, the magazine moved its offices to New York City in 1977.\n\nIn May 2006 Rolling Stone printed its 1,000th issue. Its success through the decades was due to its ability to adapt to constantly changing musical, political, and cultural climates. Issues of Rolling Stone typically include music and movie reviews, celebrity stories and photographs, information on new artists, fashion advice, and articles on politics. Rolling Stone has influenced pop culture through its \u201call-time greatest\u201d lists, such as the \u201c500 Greatest Albums of All Time\u201d (issued in November 2003) and the \u201c100 Greatest Singers of All Time\u201d (issued in November 2008)."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/business/rolling-stone-new-editor.html", "page_content": "Rolling Stone has chosen Noah Shachtman, the top editor of the news site The Daily Beast, as its next editor in chief, the magazine announced on Thursday, calling on him to continue the transformation of the 54-year-old pop music bible into a digital-first publication.\n\nMr. Shachtman, 50, said in an interview that he plans to bring along The Daily Beast\u2019s newsy approach and web metabolism when he starts his new job in September.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got to be faster, louder, harder,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be out getting scoops, taking people backstage, showing them parts of the world they don\u2019t get to see every day.\u201d\n\nMr. Shachtman will succeed Jason Fine, who stepped down in February after five and a half years as the top editor to take a job overseeing Rolling Stone\u2019s podcasts, documentaries and other media ventures."}, {"url": "https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/02/24/spin-back-here-s-how-it-plans-rock-new-generation-fans", "page_content": "With new owners, and founder Bob Guccione Jr on board, iconic music magazine Spin is ready to press play on an annual membership offering exclusive content, launch new merchandise as well as debut a TV channel. The Drum spoke to its key executives about how Spin is working to regain its relevance more than three decades after its launch.\n\nWhen nostalgic members of Generation X think of Spin, they likely recall hard-hitting journalism such as exposing the Live Aid financial scandal in the mid-1980s as well as iconic 90s cover photos of Sinead O\u2019Connor, Public Enemy and Nirvana. Far from its glory days, the music magazine ceased printing a magazine in 2012 and its digital efforts have experienced some skips and scratches.\n\nNow with new owners and the return of its original founder, can this 35-year-old brand win attention across generations today when teen spirit smells like deep-fried memes and manic TikTok clips?\n\nLike any legacy brand that needs to grow anew, its leadership has had to look in the mirror and ask: why is what we offer necessary? \u201cYou need food, you need gas in your car, you need oil in your heater, you need a roof over your head, you need medical supplies. You don\u2019t need a publication \u2013 any publication,\u201d says Bob Guccione Jr, Spin founder.\n\n\u201cThe only reason Spin should exist in 2021 is if we make it interesting enough for people to want to check it out. While there's an awful lot of excellence out there, it's only really 1% of the volume. I want Spin to be in that 1%.\u201d\n\nGuccione Jr is back in music journalism after a long break \u2013 in fact, he needed to write a piece on Steven Van Zandt, guitarist for The E Street Band and TV actor, after recently concluding his call with The Drum. While he sold and left Spin in 1997, he was invited to reunite with his brainchild last spring by its new owner, Next Management Partners, in a highly participatory advisory role to help the brand position itself for a new decade. And for every modern success story like The Washington Post, The New York Times or The Atlantic, there are thousands more legacy titles such as Spin figuring out how to build a publication in the digital age. And before it was acquired in 2020 by Next Management Partners, Spin appeared to be stalled.\n\nRiffing on exclusivity\n\nNow, there is an ambitious plan in place for reworking what Spin means to old-school fans and advertisers while introducing the brand to more millennial and Gen Z music lovers. The multi-year endeavor centers on paid subscriptions, merchandising, and a free TV channel that will span continents. While Guccione Jr has been the brand\u2019s hands-on guru in recent months, Spin chief executive officer Jimmy Hutcheson, creative director Danny Klein and managing editor Daniel Kohn have been spearheading Spin\u2019s next chapter.\n\nHutcheson tells The Drum that, in late March, Spin will launch a $100 annual membership program. Customers will get exclusive access to online concerts and \u2013 down the road when offline events become safe to attend \u2014 private parties the brand sponsors at music festivals. They\u2019ll get to log onto Spin\u2019s live video, AMA-styled \u2019Fans Ask\u2019 series and throw questions at emerging music stars.\n\nEvery month, stars like Run the Jewels, Foo Fighters or Machine Gun Kelly appear on Spin\u2019s digital covers. The covers link back to the title\u2019s history in print and generate behind-the-scenes photo shoots and video content. With that in mind, only members will get exclusive access to limited-edition merchandise like clothing and bean bags that the publication develops with its cover artists. Spin-branded collectibles such as T-shirts, beach blankets and coffee cups will also be complimentary for members. A quarterly print magazine could be added in the years to come, Hutcheson says.\n\nThe membership club will be promoted via ads on Facebook, Instagram and other digital media platforms after its early spring launch.\n\n\u201cWe're not trying to charge people for news or album reviews \u2013 those will still be free,\u201d says Hutcheson. \u201cWe really think merchandise and experiences are what people want to pay for.\u201d\n\nTaking content over-the-top\n\nIn the coming months, Spin TV \u2013 which right now represents a video section on the publication\u2019s website \u2013 will debut as a standalone, free-and-ad-supported (FAST) television channel in Japan. The goal is to bring it to the US in 2022. (Spin would not disclose the carrier beyond that it will include over-the-top partners.) The TV channel \u2013 and all of Spin\u2019s text-based and online video coverage, for that matter \u2013 will have a strong focus on music, with the goal of differentiating itself from the pan-cultural TV and digital programming offered by Vice, Complex and MTV.\n\n\u201cThat is kind of the lane we want to be in\u2014relevant and highly sought-after, known in culture and conversation, but where people say, \u2018Spin is just music. Oh, that's actually interesting,\u2019\u201d Hutcheson says. \u201cBecause MTV long moved away from music. Complex is sneakers, fashion and everything else, and then Vice is sort of all things to many people.\u201d\n\nKatie Thomas, a brand consulting lead at the Kearney Consumer Institute, says that Spin\u2019s \u201cshift back to its music-first roots allows it to engage directly and effectively with its core consumers\u201c via online video and social media.\n\nThat music focus also helps explain Japan as Spin\u2019s first foray into TV. After all, Japan\u2019s recording industry in recent years has totaled more than $2.6 billion annually, second only to the US and more than double that of third-place Germany. And Japanese consumers have historically loved American music brands and still do \u2013 consider that more than a dozen Tower Records stores are open to this day in Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto.\n\n\u201cAsian markets love authenticity,\u201d Hutcheson says, \u201cand they like to be able to peel back different layers of what a brand actually is.\u201d\n\nBranding younger\n\nUntil last winter, Spin had been owned by Billboard-The Hollywood Reporter Media for the prior four years and suffered from being the lesser favored brand in a media family that boasted notable siblings. Spin needed a parent to prioritize its success in the digital era.\n\n\u201cWe inherited a bit of an orphaned asset,\u201d says Hutcheson, who is also CEO of Next Management Partners. \u201cWe had to go in, clean things up a bit and re-energize and reinvigorate what was happening.\u201d\n\nThe brand\u2019s modern-day Generation X crowd already knew about Spin\u2019s digital offerings of album and song reviews, original reporting and video content. Nearly a million of them were following Spin\u2019s content moves on Facebook, after all. But more interest among millennials and Gen Z consumers needed to be cultivated, so Spin\u2019s marketing team last year started focusing on young-skewing digital video channels like Twitch and Instagram for owned content while working with influencers on TikTok and Snapchat.\n\n\u201dWe live-streamed over 300 hours on Twitch last year, doing big interviews with artists like Deadmau5 and The Lumineers,\u201d Hutcheson says.\n\nSo far, Spin\u2019s appeal to young adult viewers appears to be going in the right direction: its year-over-year social media audience is up 25%, adding up to 1.5 monthly unique site visitors and 10 million page views. In turn, ad sales are up 26% year-over-year, Hutcheson says. Zeroing in on the publication\u2019s 25-to-54-year-old audience that skews a little more toward male (60%) than female readers (40%), brands like Nike, Target, McDonald\u2019s and Diageo have been running ad campaigns this month.\n\nKeeping it original\n\nIn the end, Spin will have to win on the music-minded-content front against corporate rivals such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Conde Nast-owned Pitchfork as well as indie publications like Wire, PopMatters and The Big Takeover. Larry Woodard, CEO at GSA Digital and branding analyst, expressed doubts that Spin, or any other publication, could scale its brand effectively by leaning heavily into music and music culture.\n\n\u201cSo much of what causes an artist or a group to go viral is not the music,\u201d Woodard says. \u201cArtists now have more control. There are direct revenue streams, and they try to develop and keep as much control as they can. Many of them can communicate with their fans with no intermediary. They are not as reliant on traditional or established media.\u201d\n\nGuccione Jr said he envisions an opportunity for Spin to build on its name and fill a marketplace void by delivering more unvarnished reporting and commentary. He pointed to the work already published by Kohn, the editor, and his writers, who have developed in-depth articles, such as how the birthplace of jazz, New Orleans, has endured the pandemic and how three women are revolutionizing trap music with gore and fetishism in Romania\u2019s hardcore scene.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ve told the guys, \u2018Let\u2019s be the best music reporting site, the most fun, the most irreverent,\u2019\u201d Guccione Jr says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get sucked into this vortex of the publicist controlling everything. We are turning people down every day, saying, \u2018Pass, not interested, thank you very much.\u2019 We do not work for the record industry or for the distributors. We work for the reader.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/12/rolling-stone-jann-wenner/544107/", "page_content": "When I got to Rolling Stone, the party was over. I turned up just in time to see a cigarette floating in the last cocktail of the night. It was 1993, and I was in my mid-20s. I went on the road with the Rolling Stones, but they were cranky and old, bickering with reporters who called them the Strolling Bones. I hung out with Hunter S. Thompson in Woody Creek, Colorado, but he\u2019d hurt his back and broken his leg and seemed ancient, drugged, and boozy, lost in a visionary delirium. Rolling Stone, co-founded by Jann Wenner in 1967, had chronicled Woodstock and Altamont and everything else, but now appeared to have just one story left to tell\u2014its own.\n\nWenner asked me to write that story, which would also be his autobiography, given the entwinement of his life and the life of his magazine. I would be a ghost. I said no, because how do you capture the voice of a person who stammers and vents, follows tangents, does not seem to know his own mind, loves but does not always appear to like himself?\n\nThe project continued without me, first with one ghostwriter, then with two, then with at least one ghostwriter and an editor, before it landed in the ditch where I came across it 15 or so years later. Wenner\u2019s agent said the book was finished but needed punching up\u2014would I do that? I said yes. The \u201cmanuscript\u201d I was sent turned out to be a few chapters that took Wenner into high school. I backed out again. Wenner approached me a third time. Now I was to be not his ghost but his biographer. We met at the 21 Club in Manhattan. I had a list of conditions. I wanted freedom, feeling that his need for control was what had wrecked the previous attempts. To my surprise, he agreed. I wrote a proposal, which was submitted to publishers. I was offered more money than I had ever seen. I imagined it in a stack, or else in a briefcase, handed to me on a park bench. When Wenner learned the terms of the deal, he backed out. I won\u2019t go into the unpleasant particulars. Suffice it to say that the problem lay in whether he would be portrayed as he saw himself, or as he was seen by others.\n\nKnopf\n\nI was relieved. The thought of spending years tangled in the details of his life, his neuroses, was almost more than I could bear. The money had fogged my mind for a moment. I have one artifact of that experience, a picture taken by my wife minutes after my agent called to say \u201cThey\u2019ve countered the counteroffer\u201d as the bidding for the book intensified. I\u2019m riding the carousel in Central Park, grinning. Coming across the photo now, I think, Look at that fool! He believes himself to be a millionaire.\n\nWenner\u2019s story has now, at long last, been written. The job was done by Joe Hagan of New York magazine, who had the luck to be living next to Wenner in the Hudson Valley when Wenner went looking once again. Hagan called me not long after Wenner made his pitch. I had become a cautionary tale. Could the book be written, he asked, and was it worth doing? It would be tough, I told him, but what a subject, if handled correctly. Jann Wenner, after all, is more than a magazine editor. He\u2019s a personification of the Baby Boom generation, with its outsize sway\u2014for good and ill\u2014over American culture as we have known it for half a century. (The advice Hagan got from his subject was rather different from mine: \u201cAt one point, Wenner suggested I look to a 2013 biography of Woodrow Wilson as the ideal model for this one.\u201d)\n\nHagan has written a barn burner, fast and funny and gossip-filled (he names names) and also big\u2014so big that it can stand as a case study of the entire era. The Boomers\u2019 experience was Wenner\u2019s experience, and it all showed up in his magazine, and now shows up here: the Beatles and the Stones; hallucinogens and cocaine; sex, sanctioned and illicit, open and hidden (Wenner lived a closeted life until he was nearly 50); politics and protests, the war; the lifestyles of the ever more rich and famous; infirmity and old age.\n\nRolling Stone\u2019s goal was not just to listen to music but to look at the world through the lens of that music.\n\nIt\u2019s the book I could never have written. I know too little and sympathize too much. I like Wenner, and Hagan is remorseless. In his very first pages, he describes the young Wenner as a \u201clittle barbarian whose lust for money, drugs, and sex threatened to outpace his razor intellect and turn him into Augustus Gloop falling into the chocolate river of the 1960s.\u201d He characterizes Rolling Stone as an \u201cexpression of Wenner\u2019s pursuit of fame and power,\u201d a magazine more than occasionally at the mercy of its editor\u2019s \u201cunembarrassed appetite for stardom and excess [which] made him an object of scorn and parody.\u201d He sums up the biography he has written as a \u201cparable of the age of narcissism.\u201d\n\nConsider Hagan\u2019s title: Sticky Fingers. It invokes a classic Stones album, but is also a term linked to masturbators and thieves. The irony is hard to miss. In his need to establish his legacy, Wenner created precisely the outcome he was trying to avoid\u2014a truly free, deeply critical, microscopically detailed examination of every fuckup and flaw, as well as the many feats, of his existence. He\u2019s lost control of his narrative.\n\nSticky Fingers reads like a Rolling Stone article\u2014the story of a one-of-a-kind publication and the man who, for a time, was \u201cthe most important magazine editor in America,\u201d told in the magazine\u2019s own turbocharged voice. (Like me, Hagan has been a contributing editor to the magazine.) Rolling Stone was founded with $7,500, mostly borrowed, by Wenner, a 21-year-old Berkeley dropout with at least one great idea, that of \u201cshepherding the generational plotlines of the 1960s into a rambling biweekly serial of rock-and-roll news.\u201d It started as a small hippie publication\u2014John Lennon was on the first cover\u2014but quickly caught the zeitgeist. Within half a decade, the magazine\u2019s cover had become the most sought-after real estate in rock and roll.\n\nExplore the December 2017 Issue Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read. View More\n\nSome of the most important early work was done not by Wenner, a New Yorker by birth who\u2019d been sent to boarding school in Los Angeles, but by his wife, Jane. Also a New Yorker, she grew up in Stuyvesant Town. She attended the High School of Music & Art in Harlem, where \u201cshe wore black turtlenecks, smoked skinny joints, and drew moody portraits in charcoal and pencil evoking her inner torpor.\u201d Jane\u2019s parents put up much of the magazine\u2019s seed money, and Jane\u2019s taste was key in shaping Rolling Stone. And it was Jane who, with her cool affect, won the trust of rockers, photographers, and writers who would prove crucial to its takeoff. Hagan\u2019s book is as much the story of a stormy marriage as the story of a magazine.\n\nTwo insights, along with a rare gift for spotting and seducing talent, fueled Wenner\u2019s stunning success. First, he understood that rock and roll was a culture as much as an art form. His magazine\u2019s goal was not just to listen to music but to look at the world through the lens of that music. Second, he understood, deep down, that this culture\u2014peace and love and the rest\u2014was a business. Rolling Stone was designed to sell a product to advertisers. That product was the attention, and even the loyalty, of the masses of teenagers who might be withering about their bourgeois parents but were willing to spend. Some of Rolling Stone\u2019s contributors and readers later accused Wenner of selling out, but you can\u2019t sell out what\u2019s always been for sale.\n\nThe magazine took the teenage nation mainstream\u2014not just the bands but the belief system, with its heroes (Mick Jagger, Keith Richards), martyrs (John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix), and saints (Lester Bangs, Hunter Thompson). But once the magazine became a hit, it was changed by the very culture it had helped create. As newsstand sales rose, Wenner became hungry for still more newsstand sales. By the mid-\u201970s, the focus of Rolling Stone had shifted from what the editors determined to be the best in pop culture to what was measurably the biggest. The magazine that once launched bands began devoting more attention to established stars. That\u2019s how you attract a mass audience, trade up from cheap paper to glossier pages, move from San Francisco to Manhattan.\n\nThe magazine as millions came to know it was an all-seeing, bloodshot eye.\n\nIn the process, the magazine itself became a kind of celebrity. It stood for something. It was a symbol of what the kids were up to and how they were turning into their own kind of bourgeoisie. In following them, Rolling Stone was merely doing what great magazines have always done\u2014accommodating taste, which in this case meant accepting the fact that rock and roll had faded. Its stars did not move the needle the way they used to. Actors began appearing on the cover, and comedians. More interesting, the magazine figured out how to sell itself\u2014how to market the sensibility that emerged in the eccentric, insanely long, deeply reported pieces that had come to be its staple: Tom Wolfe on the astronauts (\u201cPost-Orbital Remorse,\u201d 1973), Joe Eszterhas on a semi-demonic Evel Knievel (\u201cKing of the Goons,\u201d 1974), Howard Kohn and David Weir on the Patty Hearst kidnapping (\u201cTania\u2019s World,\u201d 1975).\n\nRolling Stone was a crucible of the New Journalism, as many of its writers veered away from traditional objectivity to experiment with the techniques of fiction\u2014reportorial immersion, extended dialogue, shifting perspectives, immediacy of voice, structural variety. Of course, the most famous of these pieces were written by the writer who came to personify the magazine: the inimitable Thompson, the inventor of gonzo journalism, which he described to me as \u201clearning to fly as you\u2019re falling.\u201d\n\nThompson first met Wenner at the magazine\u2019s San Francisco office in the summer of 1970. Thompson, 33, was \u201cwearing a red Bermuda shirt and knee-high athletic socks, a pair of shades locked on his nose and a wig cocked unevenly on his head,\u201d Hagan writes. \u201cHe mumble-grumbled like a character actor from a Bogart movie, an FDR cigarette holder clenched in his jaw as he pulled one strange artifact after another from a leather satchel under his arm: flashlights, whiskey, corkscrews, flares.\u201d As for Thompson\u2019s view: \u201cAsked years later of his impression of Wenner in that first meeting, Thompson snickered and said, \u2018A troll of some kind.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJann Wenner (left) loved and needed\u2014and struggled with\u2014Hunter S. Thompson. (Kmazur / WireImage / Getty)\n\nWenner did not discover Thompson. Three years earlier, Thompson had published his first and best book, Hell\u2019s Angels. That famous voice\u2014\u201cmonster steed with a fiery anus, flat out through the eye of a beer can and up your daughter\u2019s leg\u201d\u2014spoke on the opening page. His breakthrough magazine article, \u201cThe Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved,\u201d had appeared in Scanlan\u2019s in June 1970. But Wenner did give the writer\u2014the ultimate unreliable narrator, using inebriation to bring a touch of magical realism to his reporting\u2014column inches to burn. \u201cFear and Loathing in Las Vegas,\u201d published in November 1971, was the high point.\n\nThat story\u2014\u201cWe were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold\u201d\u2014is Rolling Stone as millions came to know it: an all-seeing, bloodshot eye. The no-holds-barred style perfectly captured the mood of the \u201970s\u2014young but already looking back, living in retrospect, hungover. A worldview as much as a voice, that style let Rolling Stone wander the planet yet remain true. Thompson on the campaign trail, Thompson at the Super Bowl\u2014the magazine suddenly had a way to describe everything. This mode was the key to becoming, as Hagan puts it, \u201cthe most adventurous and ambitious newspaper-cum-magazine of the 1970s.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s success probably made his struggle with Wenner through the 1980s and \u201990s inevitable. It was a clash familiar to just about every Rolling Stone veteran who\u2019d seen Wenner, having become a celebrity himself, trade the hippie dream for pop-star friends and luxury. Wenner needed and loved Thompson, but seemed to resent the attention showered on him. For millions, it was Thompson, not Wenner, who represented Rolling Stone.\n\nAs the \u201970s turned into the \u201980s, then the \u201990s, the magazine changed in ways that Thompson could not help but notice and disdain. It went all in for Madison Avenue glitz and celebrated the wealth that marked the Boomers\u2019 ascent into the establishment. The magazine\u2019s own \u201cPerception/Reality\u201d ad campaign of the \u201980s touted its transformation, with a bearded hippie, an old Jimi Hendrix cover, and a peace symbol (perception) juxtaposed with a yuppie, a recent Bill Murray cover, and a Mercedes-Benz trademark (reality). Kurt Cobain spoke for many when he showed up to a Rolling Stone cover shoot in 1992 wearing a T-shirt that said corporate magazines still suck.\n\nMeanwhile, Thompson was out there, holding down his own little fort, trapped in the persona he\u2019d perfected for the magazine. Of the dozens of poignant rise-and-fall stories that Hagan slips into his larger epic, none is more heartbreaking than that of Thompson, whose articles, filed more and more infrequently, became less and less intelligible. In the fall of 2004, when Rolling Stone seemed as fat and profitable as it had ever been, Wenner sent me to profile Thompson. Hagan says Wenner had in mind a takedown, and that is what Thompson appeared to think, but it\u2019s not true. The sense I got from Wenner was that he wanted Thompson\u2019s voice in the magazine, and if Thompson wouldn\u2019t file a story, then Wenner would have me interview him.\n\nBut Thompson was a mess when I showed up. I lingered in his house for days, mostly waiting for him to wake up. He\u2019d appear in the kitchen each evening around 5, then begin drinking and taking pills, reaching a window of clarity between 3 and 4 a.m. He knew he owed Rolling Stone a story\u2014he had missed so many deadlines over the years\u2014and he spent a lot of time trying to get me to write it for him. And he spent hours trashing Wenner. Thompson ranted about what he\u2019d done for the magazine and what the magazine hadn\u2019t done for him. Thompson killed himself on February 20, 2005; he\u2019d ordered that his remains be cremated and blown out of a cannon.\n\nRolling Stone has been a perfect mirror. We watched it mature from hippie fun to moneymaking machine\u2014from peace and love to cash and fame. But in the past decade, its founder, who surfed the zeitgeist for generations, has finally been overtaken by the internet wave. By the last chapters of Sticky Fingers, Wenner has become a somber figure, wounded by scandals\u2014the story about the University of Virginia rape that probably never happened; the farce of sending Sean Penn to interview El Chapo in Mexico. Now in its 50th year, the print magazine is a shell of its former self. On the digital side, operated by Wenner\u2019s son Gus, revenue grows apace. Over the years, Wenner has fielded many offers to buy Rolling Stone, including one apparently in the neighborhood of half a billion dollars. In 2016, he sold a 49 percent stake in Rolling Stone to a Singapore-based music-technology company for a reported $40 million. In September, the Wenners put the remainder up for sale. \u201cPublishing is a completely different industry than what it was,\u201d Gus told The New York Times. \u201cThe trends go in one direction, and we are very aware of that.\u201d\n\nWhere did it all lead us? For Hagan, finishing up his work as Donald Trump arrived on the political scene, Rolling Stone\u2019s legacy is glaringly clear. \u201cAt one time, holding Rolling Stone was like holding a piece of hot shrapnel from the cultural explosion of the 1960s while it still glowed with feeling and meaning,\u201d he writes.\n\nAn entire identity was coiled inside [the magazine\u2019s] logo, the promise of never-ending provocation, never-ending progress. The rock-and-roll story lit the way. Don\u2019t stop thinking about tomorrow. But those visions had morphed into the Me Decade, and the Me Decade had turned into Me Decades, and finally the falcon could no longer hear the falconer, not even in the pages of Rolling Stone.\n\nOur culture has been determined by our technology. The electric guitar gave us rock and roll, which gave us Rolling Stone, a magazine remade again and again as its founder went from outside to inside, from grasping to rich, following not just fame but his own interests, which turned out to be shared by millions. Then the magazine was blown away by the next turn in technology. Rock and roll was deep and strange, which is why Rolling Stone was deep and strange. Social media are vast and shallow, which is why the magazine of my youth has gone the way of The Saturday Evening Post.\n\nAnd yet, as much as I admire Hagan\u2019s book, something is missing\u2014the infectious charm of Wenner; his gleeful, here-goes, let\u2019s-hope-we-don\u2019t-get-shot zeal for adventure. You won\u2019t come away with any sense of how much fun he could be in his heyday, how contagious his enthusiasm was, how important his loyalty could be. A writer needs to feel the freedom to look stupid, even to make a fool of himself, in order to do the kind of work he has always imagined but never before quite pulled off. Wenner let us feel that. Personality is what made him a one-of-a-kind leader, and it\u2019s not here. Wenner\u2019s pen and language weren\u2019t what defined him as an editor. It was his vision and energy that attracted the best talent and inspired such memorable work.\n\nA funny thing happens when a part of your life becomes official history. No matter how good that history is, the writer can\u2019t help getting a crucial aspect wrong. All the facts might be correct, but the spirit is lost. The effect is like a body without a soul. Everything we read about the past is bound to be incomplete because, though we might know what unfolded, we can never really know how the experience felt. The story that gets pieced together takes the place of the memory, then becomes the memory. Because this book is so good, its portrait of Jann Wenner will stick in our heads. History is not what happened, but what remains when everything else is forgotten."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/20/business/dealbook/rolling-stone-penske-media-wenner.html", "page_content": "Penske Media Corporation has acquired a controlling stake in Wenner Media, the publisher of the famed Rolling Stone magazine, the companies announced on Wednesday.\n\nFinancial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the investment values Wenner Media at roughly $100 million, according to a person familiar with the deal.

Like many legacy print publications, Rolling Stone has suffered from shrinking audiences and advertising revenues. Once a countercultural bible, the magazine\u2019s claim to cool faded as rock and roll aged. A high-profile retraction of a 2014 story about an alleged gang rape at a University of Virginia fraternity struck a blow to the brand\u2019s wallet and investigative reputation. Wenner announced in September that he planned to sell the majority stake in the magazine he helped start in 1967 with $7,500 of borrowed money. He sold the company\u2019s two other major properties, US Weekly and Men\u2019s Journal, earlier this year.\n\nPenske Media, founded by auto racing heir Jay Penske, publishes two dozen digital media brands including Variety, Deadline, and WWD. \u201cWe believe that Penske Media is uniquely qualified to partner with the Wenners to ensure the brand continues to ascend for decades across multiple media platforms,\u201d Penske said in a statement.\n\nYou can read Spin\u2019s review of Joe Hagan\u2019s Wenner biography Sticky Fingers here."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/02/business/the-media-business-advertising-spin-hopes-to-challenge-rolling-stone.html", "page_content": "Spin's financial health became tenuous in 1987, when Penthouse International Ltd., run by Mr. Guccione's father, withdrew its support. Money was scarce until the spring of 1989, when SCS Communications, a company owned by Stephen C. Swid, invested $4 million. Mr. Guccione said Spin will turn profitable next year.\n\nAuditing of Spin's circulation by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, halted in 1987, will resume shortly, said John Skipper, Spin's new president and publishing director, who formerly was a top executive at Straight Arrow Publishers, which owns Rolling Stone and US.\n\nBut advertisers remain worried about size. Spin claims a circulation of 225,000, about a million less than Rolling Stone. Magazine consultants said it needs twice that to become a ''player.'' They agreed with Mr. Skipper, a former head of circulation at Rolling Stone, that such a goal is attainable within a couple of years.\n\nPaul DuCharme, director of print media at Grey Advertising, said that for Spin to grow it must appeal to young women as well as men, who make up more than three-fifths of its readership. Spin's new executive editor, Mary Russell, a veteran of Vogue and Elle and most recently editor of Taxi, is expected to help. ''Music and fashion are one,'' she said, a point clear to anyone at a concert where thousands of young people parrot their idol's dress.\n\nMore fashion coverage should also broaden the range of advertising in Spin, two-thirds of which is for music, electronics, cigarettes and alcohol."}, {"url": "https://www.spin.com/2017/09/rolling-stone-magazine-for-sale/", "page_content": "After nearly 50 years of independence, Rolling Stone is putting itself up for sale. Wenner Media, the company controlled by magazine founder Jann S. Wenner and son Gus Wenner, will sell its controlling stake in its flagship music publication, the New York Times reported late Sunday night. The paper states that Gus, 27, engineered the sale plans; Jann, 71, described selling as \u201cthe smart thing to do.\u201d\n\nIndependent ownership, long a point of pride for Rolling Stone and any such publication these days, has become harder to maintain as the magazine industry consolidates in an effort to survive. Rolling Stone\u2019s ad revenue and magazine sales were reportedly down in recent years, and outward signs of Wenner Media\u2019s financial strain were already evident. Last September, the company accepted its first outside investment, selling a 49% stake in Rolling Stone to a Singapore music tech startup called BandLab Technologies. Earlier this year, Wenner Media sold two of its other magazines, Us Weekly and Men\u2019s Journal, to National Enquirer publisher American Media, Inc. Those two titles together had brought in about three-quarters of Wenner Media\u2019s revenue, according to the Times.\n\nEditorial decisions and missteps may have also played a role in Rolling Stone\u2018s troubles. While the brand remains iconic, Rolling Stone\u2018s distance from its heyday can only grow over time, and the magazine has had to balance the interests of its core readership with the need to attract new eyeballs. Investigative journalism helped set Rolling Stone apart, but its reputation took a hit after it was forced to retract a 2014 article about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia. Earlier this year, a libel lawsuit stemming from that piece resulted in a $3 million judgement against Wenner Media, the magazine, and the writer.\n\nBoth Jann and Gus Wenner told the Times they intend to stay in their jobs, but acknowledged that decision may be up to the future owners. They declined to name any potential buyers, though Jann Wenner said he hoped to find one with \u201clots of money.\u201d"}]}
