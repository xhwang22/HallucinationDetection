{"John Russell was born on 18 July 1827.": [{"url": "https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/John-Russell/276818", "page_content": "Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery, London\n\n(1792\u20131878). The English statesman and Whig leader Lord John Russell entered politics at an early age. He was 21 years old when he became a member of Parliament. He became prime minister at 54.\n\nRussell, son of the duke of Bedford, was born on Aug. 18, 1792, in London, England. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Russell is remembered primarily for the part he played in the passage of the Great Reform Act of 1832. The Tory duke of Wellington had been forced to resign as prime minister because he was opposed to the reform of Parliament. The Whigs (later called the Liberals) then came into power with Earl Grey as prime minister. Russell was given the task of championing the reform bill, which did away with the \u201crotten boroughs\u201d (where few or no people lived) and gave representatives to the new manufacturing cities, which had not been represented in Parliament. The House of Lords rejected it. Elections were held, and excited mobs demanded that the bill be passed in its entirety. Finally the Lords were forced to yield because of the threat that enough Whig peers would be created to give the Whigs a majority.\n\nRussell\u2019s share in the great political and humanitarian reforms that followed was unimportant. No great laws were passed in his first term as prime minister (1846\u201352), and his second term (October 1865\u2013June 1866) was too short to allow him to accomplish anything. By this time he had lost much of his popularity. The mismanagement that marked Great Britain\u2019s entrance into the Crimean War (1854\u201356) was blamed on him. He retired in 1866, and William Gladstone became Liberal party leader.\n\nRussell had a great interest in literature and spent much of his time after his retirement writing. He died at Pembroke Lodge, in Surrey, on May 28, 1878."}, {"url": "https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/john-russell", "page_content": "John Russell\n\nThe English statesman John Russell, 1st Earl Russell of Kingston Russell (1792-1878), was the author of the Great Reform Bill of 1832 and one of the founders of the British Liberal party.\n\nJohn Russell was born on Aug. 18, 1792, in London. He was the third son of the 6th Duke of Bedford. Russell was educated primarily by private tutors and at Edinburgh University.\n\nRussell's parliamentary career began in 1813, when he was elected Whig member of Parliament for Tavistock. In poor health during his early parliamentary career, Russell rarely spoke in the Commons. His vanity was great, and he was easily disturbed by criticism. But he was a man of courage and conviction. In the 1820s he emerged as a champion of parliamentary reform and religious toleration. He worked for repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts and supported Catholic emancipation in 1829.\n\nRussell was largely responsible for preparing the first Reform Bill and introduced it in the Commons in March 1831; the bill passed the Lords in June 1832. Russell was a member of the Whig Cabinets of Lords Grey and Melbourne in the 1830s, first as home secretary and then as secretary for war and the colonies (1839-1841). The Municipal Corporation Act of 1835, which expanded the electorate for town councils, was one of his contributions.\n\nAfter the fall of Sir Robert Peel's second ministry in 1846 Russell became prime minister. He held this office for the next 6 years (1846-1852). During this period he faced the Great Famine in Ireland, but his relief measures were too cautious to succeed. The Ten Hours Act of 1847 was a turning point in the history of labor legislation. Russell sympathized with the popular outcry against the papal bull that restored a Roman Catholic hierarchy in England in 1850, and he sponsored the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill (1851), which forbade the assumption by Roman Catholic clergy of titles within the United Kingdom. A more liberal attitude characterized his actions in imperial affairs. The Australian Colonies Act of 1850 extended self-government to New South Wales.\n\nLord Palmerston was the most controversial figure in the Russell Cabinet, and relations between the two were frequently strained. Palmerston was dismissed by Russell in December 1851 for having conveyed to the French ambassador Russell's approval of Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat. Two months later, however, Palmerston had his revenge when he successfully led the opposition in defeating the government's Militia Bill, and Russell resigned in 1852.\n\nRussell served as foreign secretary for a few months in 1852-1853 in Lord Aberdeen's coalition and as colonial secretary for 5 months in Palmerston's Cabinet in 1855. He returned to the Foreign Office 4 years later in the second Palmerston ministry (1859-1865) and did much to preserve British neutrality during the American Civil War. Russell became prime minister for a second time in 1865, but he resigned the following year in a dispute over the specifics of a second Reform Bill. He then retired to a private life of writing, and he died on May 28, 1878.\n\nRussell was known as \"Finality Jack\" to the British working classes, as one who opposed all further reform after 1832. This, however, was not true. He was active in the reform movement to the end of his life, and he helped to move the Whigs toward the new Liberal party under his immediate successor as party leader, William Gladstone.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe standard biography of Russell is Spencer Walpole, Life of xLord John Russell (2 vols., 1889; repr. 1968). A more recent, concise study is A. Wyatt Tilby, Lord John Russell: A Study in Civil and Religious Liberty (1930). Norman Gash, Politics in the Age of Peel (1953), is a penetrating study of the machinery of politics during the period of Russell's activities. \u25a1"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Russell-1st-Earl-Russell", "page_content": "John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, also called (until 1861) Lord John Russell, (born Aug. 18, 1792, London, Eng.\u2014died May 28, 1878, Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey), prime minister of Great Britain (1846\u201352, 1865\u201366), an aristocratic liberal and leader of the fight for passage of the Reform Bill of 1832.\n\nRussell was the third son of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. (As the younger son of a peer, he was known for most of his life as Lord John Russell; he himself was created earl in 1861.) He thus came of a family that had long demonstrated its public spirit. The depth of his liberalism probably owed much to an untypical education. Poor health forbade the rigours of an English public school, and later, his father, who was critical of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, sent him to the University of Edinburgh, where he drank deeply of Scottish philosophy.\n\nIn 1813 he became a member of Parliament and four years later made his first important speech\u2014characteristically, an attack on the government\u2019s suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. In December 1819 Russell took up the cause of parliamentary reform, making it in the early 1820s not only his own cause but also that of the Whig Party. When the Whigs came to power in 1830, he joined the small ministerial committee that was to draft a reform bill, and on March 31, 1831, he presented it to the House of Commons. Overnight, he had won a national reputation.\n\nIn the 1830s and \u201940s, Russell remained the chief promoter of liberal reform in the Whig Party\u2014although never again, perhaps, was this role so glorious as in the protracted but successful conflict over the passing of the first Reform Bill. As paymaster general under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, during roughly the first half of the 1830s, Russell championed the cause of religious freedom for both English Dissenters and Irish Roman Catholics. Indeed, he pursued these aims so zealously that, in seeking to divert some of the wealth of the established Church of Ireland (which was Protestant) to the Roman Catholics (who formed the bulk of the population), he frightened such leading Whigs as Lord Stanley (later Earl of Derby) out of the party. In the second half of the 1830s, as home secretary under Lord Melbourne, Russell, among other things, democratized the government of large towns (with the exception of London). He also reduced the number of criminal offenses liable to capital punishment and began the system of state inspection and support of public education.\n\nEven out of office from 1841 to 1846, when he stood in opposition to Sir Robert Peel, Russell left his mark. In 1845, in advance of his party, he came out in favour of total free trade, a crucial step in forcing Peel to follow him. As a result Peel split his party, the Whigs came to power, and Russell became prime minister.\n\nThis administration (1846\u201352) demonstrated that, although Russell\u2019s penchant for advanced ideas was as strong as ever, his ability to implement them was now seriously reduced. He was able to establish the 10-hour day in factory labour (1847) and to found a national board of public health (1848). But, largely because of party disunity and weak leadership, he was unable to end the civil disabilities of the Jews, extend the franchise to the workers in the cities, or guarantee security of tenure to the Irish farmers.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn the remaining years of his public career, Russell\u2019s difficulties increased. Party disunity continued and brought down his second administration (1865\u201366) when he made his last attempt to extend the franchise. But more significant, in the 1850s the national temper had changed. An age of reform had given way to a mood of self-complacency, even of belligerence. This was already evident in the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851, which Russell\u2019s government had passed and which in effect was England\u2019s defiance of the papacy.\n\nThis mood deepened, transformed, on the one hand, into an appetite for foreign conquest and, on the other, into boredom with social and political reform. In such an atmosphere Russell was inevitably overshadowed by the forceful and popular Lord Palmerston, who seized the forefront of the national stage in the Crimean War (1854\u201356). Indeed, for four years, from 1855 to 1859, Russell retired from public life and devoted more and more of his time to literature. Private life had always beckoned to him, as had the life of a litterateur. Among the English prime ministers, few wrote so copiously\u2014biography, history, poetry\u2014as Russell. He accepted an earldom in 1861, and he died at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, in 1878."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/John-Henry-Russell-USA-Rear-Admiral-post-Civil-War/6000000015312786653", "page_content": "About John Henry Russell (USA) [Rear Admiral post Civil War]\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Russell\n\nRear Admiral John Henry Russell (4 July 1827 \u2013 1 April 1897) was an officer of the United States Navy during the Mexican-American War and the American Civil War.\n\nBiography\n\nRussell was born at Frederick, Maryland on 4 July 1827 to Sir James Henry Russell and Martha Wilson Russell. He was appointed midshipman on 10 September 1841 and served in the sloop of war Cyane in the Pacific until 1843. He returned in the frigate United States in 1844 and served in St. Mary's in the Gulf of Mexico from 1844 to 1846. He participated in operations at Galveston, Corpus Christi, Brazos, Resaca, and Vera Cruz.\n\nAfter duty in Allegheny in 1847, he graduated at the United States Naval Academy in 1848. Briefly assigned to Coast Survey duty, he made a cruise to Brazil in 1849, then served on the New York-West Indies mail line from 1853 to 1856, and served as navigator in Vincennes during explorations of the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans. Assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron at the end of the decade, he returned to the United States and ordnance duty at the Washington Navy Yard just prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War.\n\nIn April 1861, he assisted in preventing ships at Norfolk from falling to the enemy; and, in September, he led a boat expedition into Pensacola Harbor to destroy the Confederate privateer Judah. He next assumed command of the gunboat Kennebec and participated in operations on the Mississippi River up to Vicksburg and served in the blockade of Mobile. Commanding Pontiac in 1863, he returned to ordnance duty at Washington in 1864 and to the Pacific Squadron to serve as commanding officer of Cyane in 1864\u201365.\n\nVarious duties, afloat and ashore, on both coasts, Atlantic and Pacific, followed, and he completed his last assignment, three years as Commandant of the Mare Island Navy Yard, in 1886.

Ward\n\nJohn Russell (1792-1878), statesman, was born on 18 August 1792 in Mayfair, London, the third son of John, sixth Duke of Bedford, and his first wife, Georgiana Elizabeth, second daughter of the fourth Viscount Torrington. Educated at Westminster School (1803-04) and Edinburgh University (1809-12), he began in 1813 that Whig political career for which his family connexions prepared him. He sat in the Commons almost without a break until 1861, when he was created first Earl Russell of Kingston Russell, Dorsetshire.\n\nRussell was more important as a British than an imperial statesman. He was in the forefront of the movement for the Reform Act of 1832. In Lord Melbourne's government (1835-41), he was the most powerful minister; and he was himself twice prime minister. He presided over the Colonial Office in 1839-41 and from February to July 1855.\n\nThe problems of Canada took up much of Russell's energies during his first term at the Colonial Office. The most important part of his Australian policy was the issue of an Order in Council, 1 May 1840, to stop convict transportation to New South Wales on 1 August that year. Russell had sat in the select committee on transportation (1837-38) and thought that New South Wales, with its large free population, should cease to be a penal station. His Order in Council was issued precipitately and caused resentment in the colony among those who wished for convict labour, and concern in England to those troubled by the difficulties of providing for the convicts elsewhere. Believing that there was no longer any need to fear the emancipists as a separate political force in New South Wales, Russell tried to liberalize its Constitution. In July 1840 he introduced a New South Wales bill designed to increase self-government by establishing a part-elective Legislative Council; the bill had no stipulations against emancipists, but it did provide for the separation of new colonies out of New South Wales. Russell abandoned it almost immediately because of his own doubts and the opposition that it raised.\n\nRussell intended also new measures of settlement. In December 1839 he dismissed the incompetent South Australian Commission. A month later he approved the appointment of a new board, the Colonial Land and Emigration Commission, to exercise wider functions throughout the empire as a whole, particularly in Australia. When he consulted them about land sales policy they advised him that all crown lands in New South Wales outside the Nineteen Counties and the towns already established should be sold at a uniform fixed price. In a dispatch of 31 May 1840 Russell proposed to divide New South Wales into three districts: the Northern including Moreton Bay, the Middle, and the Southern including the Port Phillip area. Land in the Middle District was to be sold by auction at a minimum upset price, and in the Southern District at a uniform fixed price of \u00a31 an acre, except in new towns. No immediate arrangements were made for the Northern District.\n\nAll Russell's measures for New South Wales aroused strong opposition. Governor Sir George Gipps thought the Constitution too liberal and preferred sales by auction to sales at a uniform fixed price. Powerful interests wished to retain convict labour. The Middle District did not wish the colony to be dismembered. In addition, South Australia was still in confusion; Van Diemen's Land was running down economically and, partly because transportation to New South Wales had ceased, was suffering from too many convicts. Russell resolved on retreat. In August 1841 he cancelled his instructions for the division of New South Wales and the alienation of crown lands. In addition to ending transportation to New South Wales and appointing the land and emigration commission Russell made a significant contribution in two other matters: he was responsible for the appointment of Captain George Grey as governor of South Australia, and in 1840 he had disallowed an Act of the Legislative Council of Western Australia that permitted the evidence of Aboriginals to be accepted without oath in criminal cases and provided that summary corporal punishment might be inflicted on people of this race.\n\nDuring Russell's first prime ministership (1846-52) imperial policy underwent great changes which he did little to promote and less to initiate. The third Earl Grey, who held the Colonial Office during those years, settled the government's policy on all important matters of empire, including the Australian Constitutions, land and immigration policy, and convict transportation. Russell objected privately to Grey's obstinate attempts to force convicts on the colonies, was lukewarm about his Federation proposals and thought Grey too active in policy-making. In none of these matters was his influence decisive.\n\nIn 1855 Russell was at the Colonial Office when some of the Australian Constitution bills were sent home. He decided to return the South Australian bill, which had been pushed through the Legislative Council of that colony to the annoyance of public opinion. By amending the New South Wales Constitution he defeated the attempts of that colony's conservatives to entrench their political position and persuaded parliament to pass an Act authorizing the Queen to assent to the New South Wales bill as amended. Because the Tasmanian bill was unexceptionable Russell at once obtained an Order in Council to put it into force, as allowed by the Australian Colonies Government Act of 1850. To complete the bargains made with the Australian colonies by Sir John Pakington and the Duke of Newcastle, while they were secretaries of state for war and the colonies, parliament in 1855 passed 18 & 19 Vic. c. 56, which gave the colonies control of their own land policies.\n\nRussell declined in 1855 to act on suggestions from New South Wales, Victoria and the General Association for the Australian Colonies, a private body in London, that the new Constitutions should be crowned with a federal assembly. Britain, he declared, would not federate the Australian colonies except at their official request.\n\nRussell died at Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey, on 28 May 1878. He often doubted whether self-governing colonies would remain in the empire, but, so far as Australia was concerned, he nearly always supported the liberal side.\n\nThe National Gallery, London, has portraits by G. F. Watts and Sir Francis Grant, and a marble bust by John Francis."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/people/John-Russell-Convict-Ann-1810/6000000098831997832", "page_content": "About John Russell [Convict \u201cAnn\u201d 1810]\n\nJohn RUSSELL was born c1787 (parents are currently unknown)\n\nJohn was convicted of horse theft and was sentenced to transportation for life.

Also, that there isn't a source or a positive link. According to John's death record he was born in 1883.\n\nI have been searching on Findmypast, England Crimes & Punishment 1770-1935 Institutions & Organisations Prison Registers for which there are several entries for John Russell 1808 -1810. One in particular gives the following info: John Russell Tried at WINCHESTER. Convict hulk is the \"Portland\". Series T38 Pce no 326. His record entry number is 1497 and this the same for six other records. It also states he was discharged on 17th August Ann for NSW.

There was one John Russell Winchester in March 1808 but he was charged with Horse stealing from a Colonel Winter in Portchester. (Hampshire Chronicle 14th March 1808). I think he received the death sentence and I think he was aged 21, so not our John.\n\nThere is also a Tree on Ancestry \"India's Tree\" who has Hannah and Samuel as parents of John Russell and has also linked them to Lydia Chaffey and family. I am annoyed at this one as her own sources, convict records for her John Russell are different to our John.\n\nAnyway, that's all from me for now.\n\nDenise.\n\nThe convict ship Hillsborough left Portland Roads, England on Sunday, 23 December 1798 and arrived in Sydney, NSW on 26 July 1799. The Master was William Hingston.\n\nThree hundred convicts were on board the ship when it left England and the long trip to Australia was dreadful. Governor Hunter described it to the Under Secretary as follows -\n\n\"Figure to yourself a ship having out of three hundred people embark'd in England, and having stopped for their refreshment several weeks at the Cape of Good Hope, yet hav'g upon her voyage buried of the above number ninety-five, and four since landing; those who still survive are in the most sickly and wretched state, put on board the ship in England with the cloaths only in which they stood, consequently arriv'd here naked, where cloathing is not to be found.\n\nAccording to the description of the voyage by William Noah, a convict died nearly every day. Discontent was rife among the convicts who meted out a horrible punishment to one called Wiltshire, whose nick name was \"Muckbolt\", for telling the sailors who among the convicts had removed their irons and how they were plotting to seize the ship. The convicts dealt summarily with Muckbolt by giving him twelve dozen lashes, gagged him and put needles in his tongue so he couldn't put it into his mouth. Some wanted to cut off his tongue for having betrayed them. The Captain, hearing of this then inflicted most severe punishment on all the guilty convicts. They were also deprived of provisions and water. The voyage was so uncomfortable that \"indeed Death would have been a welcome friend\".\n\nThe Hillsborough was a large and roomy ship, and, according to the Transport Commissioners, had been fitted out on an improved plan; the bars on the prison being built far apart to admit the air more freely. She embarked 152 prisoners at Gravesend, and when she arrived at the Motherbank on November 17th 1798, her Master, William Hingston, reported to the Transport Board's agent at Portsmouth, Captain Charles Patton, that one convict died and several others were sick. Sir John Fitzpatrick, who had inspected the ship in the Thames, ordered the sick to be transferred to a hospital ship, and urged most strongly that the ship's complement of convicts should not be made up from the prisoners in the Langstone Harbour hulks, aboard which the gaol fever, or typhoid, had raged in a malignant form for some time. His advice was disregarded, as were his further protests after the Langstone convicts had been embarked. He insisted, however, that five prisoners, all in an advanced sta! ge of the disease, should be disembarked, and all five died within a few days.\n\nThe Hillsborough sailed in a convoy from Portland Roads on 23rd December 1798, and at once ran into heavy weather. As her decks required caulking, and the sea was breaking over her continuously, the convicts' quarters were deluged and their bedding soaked. When the weather moderated a few days later, a youthful informer told the Captain that many of the convicts were out of their irons and intended to murder the officers. Those found out of their irons were flogged, receiving from one to six dozen lashes each, and were shackled and handcuffed, some with iron collars round their neck. The allowance of rations and water was also reduced, so that for several days the prisoners were half starved.\n\nIn all the circumstances it is not surprising that the disease carried aboard by the Langstone convicts spread rapidly, and from the beginning of January deaths became alarmingly frequent. Yet the convicts were kept closely confined and double-ironed, were short of water, and were half starved. It was, one would think, wrote William Noah, a convict who left a moving account of the prisoners sufferings in his diary of the voyage, enough to soften the heart of the most inhuman being to see us ironed, handcuffed and shackled in a dark, nasty dismal deck, without the least wholesome air, but all this did not penetrate the breasts of our inhuman Captain, and I can assure you that the Doctor was kept at such a distance, and so strict was he look after, that I have known him sit up till opportunity would suite to steal a little water to quench the thirst of those who were bad, he being on a very small allowance for them.\n\nAccording to Noah, thirty convicts had died when the Hillsborough anchored in Table Bay on April 13th 1799. There were then about 100 prisoners very ill, and although fresh provisions were served, deaths became so frequent that the authorities were alarmed, and the ship was ordered to move to False Bay. Noah alleges that to avoid further interrogation, the Master buried some of the convicts at the Harbour Entrance, but within a few days the bodies were washed ashore. On may 5, by which time at least 28 convicts had died since the Ship's arrival at Table Bay, the Surgeon, JJW Kunst, returned from Capetown with an order permitting the sick to be landed. Why this step was so long delayed is incomprehensible but it was useless because no provision was made for the proper accommodation of the patients ashore. When 146 were landed on May 6 they found that their miserable hospital had previously been a stable and was without a fireplace, windows and lavatory accommodation, an! d next morning 56 of the prisoners were returned to the ship. When the Hillsborough sailed on May 29 at least 50 of the convicts had been buried at the Cape.\n\nGovernor Hunter, when the Hillsborough reached Sydney, described the survivors as the most wretched and miserable convicts I have ever beheld, in the most sickly and wretched state. almost every prisoner required hospital treatment. The frightful mortality was due primarily to the embarkation of the Langstone prisoners, but also partly to the harsh treatment of the convicts on the voyage. Noah's diary proves that they were kept double-ironed, and when on deck were chained together, so that they could not walk about at all, but had to stand up or lie down on the deck. They were inadequately fed, and, especially between the Cape and Port Jackson, the weather was so stormy that the prison was continuously damp and the convicts bedding seldom dry.\n\nGEDCOM Note"}], "John Russell was English.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Russell-1st-Earl-Russell", "page_content": "John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, also called (until 1861) Lord John Russell, (born Aug. 18, 1792, London, Eng.\u2014died May 28, 1878, Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park, Surrey), prime minister of Great Britain (1846\u201352, 1865\u201366), an aristocratic liberal and leader of the fight for passage of the Reform Bill of 1832.\n\nRussell was the third son of John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford. (As the younger son of a peer, he was known for most of his life as Lord John Russell; he himself was created earl in 1861.) He thus came of a family that had long demonstrated its public spirit. The depth of his liberalism probably owed much to an untypical education. Poor health forbade the rigours of an English public school, and later, his father, who was critical of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, sent him to the University of Edinburgh, where he drank deeply of Scottish philosophy.\n\nIn 1813 he became a member of Parliament and four years later made his first important speech\u2014characteristically, an attack on the government\u2019s suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. In December 1819 Russell took up the cause of parliamentary reform, making it in the early 1820s not only his own cause but also that of the Whig Party. When the Whigs came to power in 1830, he joined the small ministerial committee that was to draft a reform bill, and on March 31, 1831, he presented it to the House of Commons. Overnight, he had won a national reputation.\n\nIn the 1830s and \u201940s, Russell remained the chief promoter of liberal reform in the Whig Party\u2014although never again, perhaps, was this role so glorious as in the protracted but successful conflict over the passing of the first Reform Bill. As paymaster general under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, during roughly the first half of the 1830s, Russell championed the cause of religious freedom for both English Dissenters and Irish Roman Catholics. Indeed, he pursued these aims so zealously that, in seeking to divert some of the wealth of the established Church of Ireland (which was Protestant) to the Roman Catholics (who formed the bulk of the population), he frightened such leading Whigs as Lord Stanley (later Earl of Derby) out of the party. In the second half of the 1830s, as home secretary under Lord Melbourne, Russell, among other things, democratized the government of large towns (with the exception of London). He also reduced the number of criminal offenses liable to capital punishment and began the system of state inspection and support of public education.\n\nEven out of office from 1841 to 1846, when he stood in opposition to Sir Robert Peel, Russell left his mark. In 1845, in advance of his party, he came out in favour of total free trade, a crucial step in forcing Peel to follow him. As a result Peel split his party, the Whigs came to power, and Russell became prime minister.\n\nThis administration (1846\u201352) demonstrated that, although Russell\u2019s penchant for advanced ideas was as strong as ever, his ability to implement them was now seriously reduced. He was able to establish the 10-hour day in factory labour (1847) and to found a national board of public health (1848). But, largely because of party disunity and weak leadership, he was unable to end the civil disabilities of the Jews, extend the franchise to the workers in the cities, or guarantee security of tenure to the Irish farmers.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe Now\n\nIn the remaining years of his public career, Russell\u2019s difficulties increased. Party disunity continued and brought down his second administration (1865\u201366) when he made his last attempt to extend the franchise. But more significant, in the 1850s the national temper had changed. An age of reform had given way to a mood of self-complacency, even of belligerence. This was already evident in the Ecclesiastical Titles Act of 1851, which Russell\u2019s government had passed and which in effect was England\u2019s defiance of the papacy.\n\nThis mood deepened, transformed, on the one hand, into an appetite for foreign conquest and, on the other, into boredom with social and political reform. In such an atmosphere Russell was inevitably overshadowed by the forceful and popular Lord Palmerston, who seized the forefront of the national stage in the Crimean War (1854\u201356). Indeed, for four years, from 1855 to 1859, Russell retired from public life and devoted more and more of his time to literature. Private life had always beckoned to him, as had the life of a litterateur. Among the English prime ministers, few wrote so copiously\u2014biography, history, poetry\u2014as Russell.

As the third son of the then Duke of Bedford, he was entitled to use one of the family's lower titles. Before becoming Prime Minister, he served in other important posts, such as Home Secretary, Colonial Secretary and Foreign Secretary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/John-Russell/276818", "page_content": "Courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery, London\n\n(1792\u20131878). The English statesman and Whig leader Lord John Russell entered politics at an early age. He was 21 years old when he became a member of Parliament. He became prime minister at 54.\n\nRussell, son of the duke of Bedford, was born on Aug. 18, 1792, in London, England. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Russell is remembered primarily for the part he played in the passage of the Great Reform Act of 1832. The Tory duke of Wellington had been forced to resign as prime minister because he was opposed to the reform of Parliament. The Whigs (later called the Liberals) then came into power with Earl Grey as prime minister. Russell was given the task of championing the reform bill, which did away with the \u201crotten boroughs\u201d (where few or no people lived) and gave representatives to the new manufacturing cities, which had not been represented in Parliament. The House of Lords rejected it. Elections were held, and excited mobs demanded that the bill be passed in its entirety. Finally the Lords were forced to yield because of the threat that enough Whig peers would be created to give the Whigs a majority.\n\nRussell\u2019s share in the great political and humanitarian reforms that followed was unimportant. No great laws were passed in his first term as prime minister (1846\u201352), and his second term (October 1865\u2013June 1866) was too short to allow him to accomplish anything. By this time he had lost much of his popularity. The mismanagement that marked Great Britain\u2019s entrance into the Crimean War (1854\u201356) was blamed on him. He retired in 1866, and William Gladstone became Liberal party leader.\n\nRussell had a great interest in literature and spent much of his time after his retirement writing.

He was the third son of the 6th Duke of Bedford. Russell was educated primarily by private tutors and at Edinburgh University.\n\nRussell's parliamentary career began in 1813, when he was elected Whig member of Parliament for Tavistock. In poor health during his early parliamentary career, Russell rarely spoke in the Commons. His vanity was great, and he was easily disturbed by criticism. But he was a man of courage and conviction. In the 1820s he emerged as a champion of parliamentary reform and religious toleration. He worked for repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts and supported Catholic emancipation in 1829.\n\nRussell was largely responsible for preparing the first Reform Bill and introduced it in the Commons in March 1831; the bill passed the Lords in June 1832. Russell was a member of the Whig Cabinets of Lords Grey and Melbourne in the 1830s, first as home secretary and then as secretary for war and the colonies (1839-1841). The Municipal Corporation Act of 1835, which expanded the electorate for town councils, was one of his contributions.\n\nAfter the fall of Sir Robert Peel's second ministry in 1846 Russell became prime minister. He held this office for the next 6 years (1846-1852). During this period he faced the Great Famine in Ireland, but his relief measures were too cautious to succeed. The Ten Hours Act of 1847 was a turning point in the history of labor legislation. Russell sympathized with the popular outcry against the papal bull that restored a Roman Catholic hierarchy in England in 1850, and he sponsored the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill (1851), which forbade the assumption by Roman Catholic clergy of titles within the United Kingdom. A more liberal attitude characterized his actions in imperial affairs. The Australian Colonies Act of 1850 extended self-government to New South Wales.\n\nLord Palmerston was the most controversial figure in the Russell Cabinet, and relations between the two were frequently strained. Palmerston was dismissed by Russell in December 1851 for having conveyed to the French ambassador Russell's approval of Louis Napoleon's coup d'etat. Two months later, however, Palmerston had his revenge when he successfully led the opposition in defeating the government's Militia Bill, and Russell resigned in 1852.\n\nRussell served as foreign secretary for a few months in 1852-1853 in Lord Aberdeen's coalition and as colonial secretary for 5 months in Palmerston's Cabinet in 1855. He returned to the Foreign Office 4 years later in the second Palmerston ministry (1859-1865) and did much to preserve British neutrality during the American Civil War. Russell became prime minister for a second time in 1865, but he resigned the following year in a dispute over the specifics of a second Reform Bill. He then retired to a private life of writing, and he died on May 28, 1878.\n\nRussell was known as \"Finality Jack\" to the British working classes, as one who opposed all further reform after 1832. This, however, was not true. He was active in the reform movement to the end of his life, and he helped to move the Whigs toward the new Liberal party under his immediate successor as party leader, William Gladstone.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe standard biography of Russell is Spencer Walpole, Life of xLord John Russell (2 vols., 1889; repr. 1968). A more recent, concise study is A. Wyatt Tilby, Lord John Russell: A Study in Civil and Religious Liberty (1930). Norman Gash, Politics in the Age of Peel (1953), is a penetrating study of the machinery of politics during the period of Russell's activities. \u25a1"}, {"url": "https://liberalhistory.org.uk/history/russell-lord-john/", "page_content": "The leading Liberal politician from the mid-1830s to the mid-1850s, Russell was twice Prime Minister; he was associated particularly with the issues of parliamentary, educational and Irish reform. He was a Foxite Whig who updated Fox\u2019s attitudes to make them more relevant to the second quarter of the nineteenth century, and added to them a strong sense of Christian responsibility.\n\nLord John Russell was born in London into one of the leading Whig families; his father became 6th Duke of Bedford in 1802. Born prematurely, he remained puny throughout his life, and ill-health as a child meant that he was educated mostly by private tutors, including Edmund Cartwright, inventor of the power-loom. He studied at Edinburgh University from 1809 to 1812, and attended lectures by Dugald Stewart and other Enlightenment intellects. He travelled to Spain three times during the national and liberal struggle against Napoleon, which fired his imagination. After the war ended in 1815, he also visited France and Italy frequently, developing a strong interest in European culture.\n\nIn 1835 he married Lady Adelaide Ribblesdale, a widow, who died in 1838. In 1841 Russell married the twenty-five year old Lady Frances Anna Maria Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, daughter of the second Earl of Minto. From his two marriages Russell had three daughters and three sons.\n\nHe became an MP in 1813, initially for the family borough of Tavistock. In Parliament, his mentor was Lord Holland, Fox\u2019s nephew and political heir, and Russell quickly became a prominent member of the Foxite wing of the opposition. The Whigs remained in opposition for the next seventeen years, and authorship was his main activity in this period. He wrote a biography of his ancestor Lord William Russell, a novel, a play, an essay on the English constitution and a number of historical surveys. All these breathed the spirit of Foxite Whiggism; Russell kept a statue of Charles James Fox by his writing desk.\n\nRussell\u2019s key ideas were the reform of the English constitution so as to maintain the country\u2019s libertarian and representative traditions, state support for a broad moral and religious education for spiritual and social reasons, religious integration in Britain and Ireland through constitutional pluralism and avoidance of dogmatic narrowness, a strong British presence in the world on behalf of liberty and a great emphasis on the responsibility of politicians to promote all these key ideas.\n\nOn the constitution, Russell was an unwavering admirer of the men of the seventeenth century, including his ancestors, who had fought successfully to secure civil liberties from the potential oppression of an over-mighty crown. On the one hand, therefore, he continued to believe that there was a greater threat to liberty from the abuse of power than from mass uprisings, since he tended to think that if men of property remained active, visible and public-spirited political leaders they would generally command popular loyalty. His main fear was of executive misgovernment and of decadent, selfish, irresponsible aristocrats whom he blamed for the French Revolution. Like all Whigs, he was suspicious of George III and Pitt\u2019s apparent revival of royal power in the late eighteenth century. On the other hand, he was a great patriot, confident that since 1688 the British political system had been much purer and more libertarian than that of the continental powers and that relatively minor changes to the constitution would be enough to maintain the legitimacy of the regime.\n\nHis most important cause during these years was that of parliamentary reform, and when the Whigs came to power in 1830 he was selected as a member of the Committee of Four to prepare their Reform Bill, and introduced it. He was promoted to cabinet during the Reform Bill struggles in 1831. Like many Whigs of his generation, Russell saw the need for a bold and systematic social policy to tackle the problems of population growth and urbanisation, and argued that one great merit of parliamentary reform would be to bolster public confidence in government\u2019s legitimate authority. He believed that the 1832 Reform Act would force ministers and local leaders to be more active and accountable, and would facilitate a more legislative style of party politics, in tune with his strand of Whiggism.\n\nRussell\u2019s initiative of 1834 in favour of the principle of state appropriation of the surplus revenues of the Anglican Church of Ireland was one of the factors precipitating the political crisis of 1834-35. This saw the Whigs briefly thrown out of office, only to return in 1835 with Lord Melbourne as Prime Minister and Lord John as Leader of the House of Commons. He held this post for the next six years, with great distinction, and became the leading figure in the party. As Home Secretary he supervised key reforms of local government (the Municipal Corporations Act 1835), the criminal law, policing and prisons, and was responsible for the educational legislation of 1839. Then as Colonial Secretary between 1839 and 1841 he helped to settle Canada after the 1837 rebellion.\n\nWhen the Whigs returned to power after the Corn Law crisis of 1846, Russell was the obvious choice as Prime Minister. His government extended state support for education and passed important public health and factory reform measures. But it soon became politically beleaguered, because of its lack of a majority, the fragmentation of the two \u2013 party system, and the severe tensions thrown up by the Irish Famine and then by the economic and social turbulence of 1847-49 at home and abroad. After 1848, Russell always struggled to assert his authority, and was damaged particularly by his alienation of Irish MPs following his criticism of the Pope in 1850, and by his unpopular dismissal of the buccaneering Palmerston from the Foreign Office in late 1851.\n\nRussell\u2019s long-term commitment to education legislation was the best example of his active approach to social issues. His anxiety that the state should promote, subsidise and regulate schooling in order to attack vice and sensuality, which bore fruit in the legislation of 1839 and 1847 and further initiatives in the 1850s and 1860s, was originally encouraged by his anxiety about Chartism and his hostility to the attempt by High Church Anglicans to dominate education through the National Society. As the last point suggests, one of Russell\u2019s strongest antagonisms was to narrow clericalism. He had a simple faith himself, based on the precepts of full-hearted love of God and the human race. He distrusted religious dogmas, which he saw as man-made inventions which created division and conflict for the benefit of sectarian institutions and power-hungry egos.\n\nAfter his government fell in 1852, Russell had to play second fiddle, first to Aberdeen, whom he served as Leader in the Commons in the 1852-55 coalition, and then to Palmerston until the latter\u2019s death in 1865. In Palmerston\u2019s 1859-65 government he served as Foreign Secretary and was associated, like Palmerston, with an assertively liberal foreign policy (over the Eastern and then the Italian questions) and, unlike him, with the cause of parliamentary reform. Russell\u2019s pride in British liberal constitutional traditions and his ancestral Whiggism convinced him that political leaders had a duty to promote Britain\u2019s liberal values abroad. This, he felt, was the way to uphold national and personal honour, which were both important concepts for him.\n\nHis main reason for advocating further reform in the 1850s and 1860s was to revitalise a sluggish House of Commons, particularly on Irish and educational questions, and to revive party spirit on the Liberal benches again to the benefit of politicians like himself, rather than his rival Palmerston.\n\nOn Palmerston\u2019s death he returned to the premiership and his first major act as Prime Minister was to propose a substantial Reform Bill in 1866, but this was defeated by Liberal dissidents, and Russell resigned, never to hold office again. He never formally retired but at the end of 1867 he indicated his intention to Gladstone and a public letter early in 1868 was taken as the opportunity by Gladstone to direct the party towards a new policy on the Irish Church. Russell continued to speak in the Lords on a range of issues including education and concurrent endowment, his own alternative solution to the Irish Church.\n\nHaving sat for the City of London since 1841, he accepted a peerage as Earl Russell in 1861. He died on 28 May 1878.\n\nKey works of Lord John Russell include Essay on the History of the English Government and Constitution (1821), Selections from Speeches, 1817-1841 (2 vols, 1870), Essays on the Rise and Progress of the Christian Religion (1873) and Recollections and Suggestions, 1813-1873 (1875).

Russell was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and soon showed a strong inclination for art. He trained under Francis Cotes RA (of Cavendish Square, London), one of the pioneers of English pastel painting, and, like Cotes, was an admirer of the pastel drawings of Rosalba Carriera whose methods influenced his technique of \"sweetening\". At the age of 19 he converted to Methodism, which was the cause of tension with his family and with his teacher; he made no secret of his strong evangelical leanings and would attempt to preach and convert at every opportunity.\n\nRussell set up his own studio, in London, in 1767. He made the acquaintance of the notorious Dr. William Dodd, whose portrait he painted in 1768. He was introduced to Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to give up painting and attend her Methodist ministers' training college at Trevecca in Wales. On 5 February 1770, he married Hannah Faden, daughter of a Charing Cross print and map seller, whom he had converted. They lived at No. 7 Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, where he had moved in 1770.\n\nRussell's work caused him to travel extensively around Britain. In 1772, he wrote Elements of Painting with Crayons, by which time he had won premiums for his drawings from the Society of Arts in 1759 and 1760, and entered the Royal Academy school of art in 1770, winning its gold medal for figure drawing the same year. He exhibited at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in 1768 and showed 330 works at the Academy between 1769 until and his death.\n\nIn 1770, Russell painted Methodist minister, George Whitefield (engraved by James Watson) and the future philanthropist, William Wilberforce, then only eleven years old. In 1771, he exhibited a portrait in oils of Charles Wesley at the Royal Academy and, in 1772, painted Selina, Countess of Huntingdon in pastel. This was a symbolic picture, and was lost on its voyage out; but it was engraved, and he later also painted her in oils. Also in that year he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. The following year, 1773, he painted John Wesley (engraved by Bland).\n\nIn 1788, after a long wait, Russell was elected a royal academician, in the same year painting a portrait of the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. In 1789, he was commissioned to portray the royal physician Francis Willis. The results obviously pleased the monarch as, in 1790, he was appointed Crayon (pastel) Painter to King George III, Queen Charlotte, the Prince of Wales (both of whom Russell also painted) and the Duke of York. With such royal patronage, he developed a large and fashionable clientele.\n\nRussell was a man of deep religious beliefs, a devout follower of George Whitefield. He began an elaborate introspective diary in John Byrom's shorthand in 1766 and continued it to the time of his death. In it, he recorded his own mental condition and religious exercises, and occasionally information concerning his sitters. Though his religion appears to have become less militant after his marriage, his diary bears witness to his anxiety with regard to his spiritual welfare. Not only would he not work on Sunday, but he would allow no one to enter his painting-room. He was afraid to go out to dinner on account of the loose and blasphemous conversation which he might hear. He was on good terms with Sir Joshua Reynolds, with whom he dined at the academy, the Dilettanti Society, and the Literary Club (now The Club), but he records that on these or other festive occasions he always left early.\n\nHe was troubled by ill-health for much of his life, and in 1803 became almost deaf following a bout of cholera. He died in Hull in 1806 after contracting typhus."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bertrand-Russell", "page_content": "As a founding figure of the analytic movement in philosophy, Bertrand Russell helped to transform the substance, character, and style of philosophy in the English-speaking world. He was also one of the greatest logicians of the 20th century. An outspoken social reformer, he campaigned effectively against unjust and irrational impediments to human freedom and happiness.\n\nDuring his childhood Bertrand Russell was educated at home. In 1890 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge , where he studied mathematics and philosophy , graduating with first-class honours in both (1893 and 1894, respectively) and winning a fellowship in the latter in 1895. That year he briefly attended lectures in economics at the University of Berlin .\n\nBertrand Russell\u2019s childhood was grief-stricken and lonely. His mother and sister died when he was two years old, and his father died some 18 months later. He and his brother, Frank, were cared for by their paternal grandparents, but their grandfather died soon after Bertrand\u2019s sixth birthday. Educated at home, he was isolated from other children.\n\nBertrand Russell, in full Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell of Kingston Russell, Viscount Amberley of Amberley and of Ardsalla, (born May 18, 1872, Trelleck, Monmouthshire, Wales\u2014died February 2, 1970, Penrhyndeudraeth, Merioneth), British philosopher, logician, and social reformer, founding figure in the analytic movement in Anglo-American philosophy, and recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. Russell\u2019s contributions to logic, epistemology, and the philosophy of mathematics established him as one of the foremost philosophers of the 20th century. To the general public, however, he was best known as a campaigner for peace and as a popular writer on social, political, and moral subjects. During a long, productive, and often turbulent life, he published more than 70 books and about 2,000 articles, married four times, became involved in innumerable public controversies, and was honoured and reviled in almost equal measure throughout the world. Russell\u2019s article on the philosophical consequences of relativity appeared in the 13th edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.\n\nRussell was born in Ravenscroft, the country home of his parents, Lord and Lady Amberley. His grandfather, Lord John Russell, was the youngest son of the 6th Duke of Bedford. In 1861, after a long and distinguished political career in which he served twice as prime minister, Lord Russell was ennobled by Queen Victoria, becoming the 1st Earl Russell. Bertrand Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell in 1931, after his elder brother, Frank, died childless.\n\nBritannica Quiz Numbers and Mathematics\n\nRussell\u2019s early life was marred by tragedy and bereavement. By the time he was age six, his sister, Rachel, his parents, and his grandfather had all died, and he and Frank were left in the care of their grandmother, Countess Russell. Though Frank was sent to Winchester School, Bertrand was educated privately at home, and his childhood, to his later great regret, was spent largely in isolation from other children. Intellectually precocious, he became absorbed in mathematics from an early age and found the experience of learning Euclidean geometry at the age of 11 \u201cas dazzling as first love,\u201d because it introduced him to the intoxicating possibility of certain, demonstrable knowledge. This led him to imagine that all knowledge might be provided with such secure foundations, a hope that lay at the very heart of his motivations as a philosopher. His earliest philosophical work was written during his adolescence and records the skeptical doubts that led him to abandon the Christian faith in which he had been brought up by his grandmother.\n\nIn 1890 Russell\u2019s isolation came to an end when he entered Trinity College, University of Cambridge, to study mathematics. There he made lifelong friends through his membership in the famously secretive student society the Apostles, whose members included some of the most influential philosophers of the day. Inspired by his discussions with this group, Russell abandoned mathematics for philosophy and won a fellowship at Trinity on the strength of a thesis entitled An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry, a revised version of which was published as his first philosophical book in 1897. Following Kant\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), this work presented a sophisticated idealist theory that viewed geometry as a description of the structure of spatial intuition.\n\nIn 1896 Russell published his first political work, German Social Democracy. Though sympathetic to the reformist aims of the German socialist movement, it included some trenchant and farsighted criticisms of Marxist dogmas. The book was written partly as the outcome of a visit to Berlin in 1895 with his first wife, Alys Pearsall Smith, whom he had married the previous year. In Berlin, Russell formulated an ambitious scheme of writing two series of books, one on the philosophy of the sciences, the other on social and political questions. \u201cAt last,\u201d as he later put it, \u201cI would achieve a Hegelian synthesis in an encyclopaedic work dealing equally with theory and practice.\u201d He did, in fact, come to write on all the subjects he intended, but not in the form that he envisaged. Shortly after finishing his book on geometry, he abandoned the metaphysical idealism that was to have provided the framework for this grand synthesis.\n\nRussell\u2019s abandonment of idealism is customarily attributed to the influence of his friend and fellow Apostle G.E. Moore. A much greater influence on his thought at this time, however, was a group of German mathematicians that included Karl Weierstrass, Georg Cantor, and Richard Dedekind, whose work was aimed at providing mathematics with a set of logically rigorous foundations. For Russell, their success in this endeavour was of enormous philosophical as well as mathematical significance; indeed, he described it as \u201cthe greatest triumph of which our age has to boast.\u201d After becoming acquainted with this body of work, Russell abandoned all vestiges of his earlier idealism and adopted the view, which he was to hold for the rest of his life, that analysis rather than synthesis was the surest method of philosophy and that therefore all the grand system building of previous philosophers was misconceived. In arguing for this view with passion and acuity, Russell exerted a profound influence on the entire tradition of English-speaking analytic philosophy, bequeathing to it its characteristic style, method, and tone.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The philosophical case for this point of view\u2014subsequently known as logicism\u2014was stated at length in The Principles of Mathematics (1903). There Russell argued that the whole of mathematics could be derived from a few simple axioms that made no use of specifically mathematical notions, such as number and square root, but were rather confined to purely logical notions, such as proposition and class. In this way not only could the truths of mathematics be shown to be immune from doubt, they could also be freed from any taint of subjectivity, such as the subjectivity involved in Russell\u2019s earlier Kantian view that geometry describes the structure of spatial intuition. Near the end of his work on The Principles of Mathematics, Russell discovered that he had been anticipated in his logicist philosophy of mathematics by the German mathematician Gottlob Frege, whose book The Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) contained, as Russell put it, \u201cmany things\u2026which I believed I had invented.\u201d Russell quickly added an appendix to his book that discussed Frege\u2019s work, acknowledged Frege\u2019s earlier discoveries, and explained the differences in their respective understandings of the nature of logic.\n\nThe tragedy of Russell\u2019s intellectual life is that the deeper he thought about logic, the more his exalted conception of its significance came under threat. He himself described his philosophical development after The Principles of Mathematics as a \u201cretreat from Pythagoras.\u201d The first step in this retreat was his discovery of a contradiction\u2014now known as Russell\u2019s Paradox\u2014at the very heart of the system of logic upon which he had hoped to build the whole of mathematics. The contradiction arises from the following considerations: Some classes are members of themselves (e.g., the class of all classes), and some are not (e.g., the class of all men), so we ought to be able to construct the class of all classes that are not members of themselves. But now, if we ask of this class \u201cIs it a member of itself?\u201d we become enmeshed in a contradiction. If it is, then it is not, and if it is not, then it is. This is rather like defining the village barber as \u201cthe man who shaves all those who do not shave themselves\u201d and then asking whether the barber shaves himself or not.\n\nAt first this paradox seemed trivial, but the more Russell reflected upon it, the deeper the problem seemed, and eventually he was persuaded that there was something fundamentally wrong with the notion of class as he had understood it in The Principles of Mathematics. Frege saw the depth of the problem immediately. When Russell wrote to him to tell him of the paradox, Frege replied, \u201carithmetic totters.\u201d The foundation upon which Frege and Russell had hoped to build mathematics had, it seemed, collapsed. Whereas Frege sank into a deep depression, Russell set about repairing the damage by attempting to construct a theory of logic immune to the paradox. Like a malignant cancerous growth, however, the contradiction reappeared in different guises whenever Russell thought that he had eliminated it.\n\nEventually, Russell\u2019s attempts to overcome the paradox resulted in a complete transformation of his scheme of logic, as he added one refinement after another to the basic theory. In the process, important elements of his \u201cPythagorean\u201d view of logic were abandoned. In particular, Russell came to the conclusion that there were no such things as classes and propositions and that therefore, whatever logic was, it was not the study of them. In their place he substituted a bewilderingly complex theory known as the ramified theory of types, which, though it successfully avoided contradictions such as Russell\u2019s Paradox, was (and remains) extraordinarily difficult to understand. By the time he and his collaborator, Alfred North Whitehead, had finished the three volumes of Principia Mathematica (1910\u201313), the theory of types and other innovations to the basic logical system had made it unmanageably complicated. Very few people, whether philosophers or mathematicians, have made the gargantuan effort required to master the details of this monumental work. It is nevertheless rightly regarded as one of the great intellectual achievements of the 20th century.\n\nPrincipia Mathematica is a herculean attempt to demonstrate mathematically what The Principles of Mathematics had argued for philosophically, namely that mathematics is a branch of logic. The validity of the individual formal proofs that make up the bulk of its three volumes has gone largely unchallenged, but the philosophical significance of the work as a whole is still a matter of debate. Does it demonstrate that mathematics is logic? Only if one regards the theory of types as a logical truth, and about that there is much more room for doubt than there was about the trivial truisms upon which Russell had originally intended to build mathematics. Moreover, Kurt G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem (1931) proves that there cannot be a single logical theory from which the whole of mathematics is derivable: all consistent theories of arithmetic are necessarily incomplete. Principia Mathematica cannot, however, be dismissed as nothing more than a heroic failure. Its influence on the development of mathematical logic and the philosophy of mathematics has been immense.\n\nDespite their differences, Russell and Frege were alike in taking an essentially Platonic view of logic. Indeed, the passion with which Russell pursued the project of deriving mathematics from logic owed a great deal to what he would later somewhat scornfully describe as a \u201ckind of mathematical mysticism.\u201d As he put it in his more disillusioned old age, \u201cI disliked the real world and sought refuge in a timeless world, without change or decay or the will-o\u2019-the-wisp of progress.\u201d Russell, like Pythagoras and Plato before him, believed that there existed a realm of truth that, unlike the messy contingencies of the everyday world of sense-experience, was immutable and eternal. This realm was accessible only to reason, and knowledge of it, once attained, was not tentative or corrigible but certain and irrefutable. Logic, for Russell, was the means by which one gained access to this realm, and thus the pursuit of logic was, for him, the highest and noblest enterprise life had to offer.\n\nIn philosophy the greatest impact of Principia Mathematica has been through its so-called theory of descriptions. This method of analysis, first introduced by Russell in his article \u201cOn Denoting\u201d (1905), translates propositions containing definite descriptions (e.g., \u201cthe present king of France\u201d) into expressions that do not\u2014the purpose being to remove the logical awkwardness of appearing to refer to things (such as the present king of France) that do not exist. Originally developed by Russell as part of his efforts to overcome the contradictions in his theory of logic, this method of analysis has since become widely influential even among philosophers with no specific interest in mathematics. The general idea at the root of Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions\u2014that the grammatical structures of ordinary language are distinct from, and often conceal, the true \u201clogical forms\u201d of expressions\u2014has become his most enduring contribution to philosophy.\n\nRussell later said that his mind never fully recovered from the strain of writing Principia Mathematica, and he never again worked on logic with quite the same intensity. In 1918 he wrote Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, which was intended as a popularization of Principia, but, apart from this, his philosophical work tended to be on epistemology rather than logic. In 1914, in Our Knowledge of the External World, Russell argued that the world is \u201cconstructed\u201d out of sense-data, an idea that he refined in The Philosophy of Logical Atomism (1918\u201319). In The Analysis of Mind (1921) and The Analysis of Matter (1927), he abandoned this notion in favour of what he called neutral monism, the view that the \u201cultimate stuff\u201d of the world is neither mental nor physical but something \u201cneutral\u201d between the two. Although treated with respect, these works had markedly less impact upon subsequent philosophers than his early works in logic and the philosophy of mathematics, and they are generally regarded as inferior by comparison.\n\nConnected with the change in his intellectual direction after the completion of Principia was a profound change in his personal life. Throughout the years that he worked single-mindedly on logic, Russell\u2019s private life was bleak and joyless. He had fallen out of love with his first wife, Alys, though he continued to live with her. In 1911, however, he fell passionately in love with Lady Ottoline Morrell. Doomed from the start (because Morrell had no intention of leaving her husband), this love nevertheless transformed Russell\u2019s entire life. He left Alys and began to hope that he might, after all, find fulfillment in romance. Partly under Morrell\u2019s influence, he also largely lost interest in technical philosophy and began to write in a different, more accessible style. Through writing a best-selling introductory survey called The Problems of Philosophy (1911), Russell discovered that he had a gift for writing on difficult subjects for lay readers, and he began increasingly to address his work to them rather than to the tiny handful of people capable of understanding Principia Mathematica.\n\nIn the same year that he began his affair with Morrell, Russell met Ludwig Wittgenstein, a brilliant young Austrian who arrived at Cambridge to study logic with Russell. Fired with intense enthusiasm for the subject, Wittgenstein made great progress, and within a year Russell began to look to him to provide the next big step in philosophy and to defer to him on questions of logic. However, Wittgenstein\u2019s own work, eventually published in 1921 as Logisch-philosophische Abhandlung (Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1922), undermined the entire approach to logic that had inspired Russell\u2019s great contributions to the philosophy of mathematics. It persuaded Russell that there were no \u201ctruths\u201d of logic at all, that logic consisted entirely of tautologies, the truth of which was not guaranteed by eternal facts in the Platonic realm of ideas but lay, rather, simply in the nature of language. This was to be the final step in the retreat from Pythagoras and a further incentive for Russell to abandon technical philosophy in favour of other pursuits.\n\nDuring World War I Russell was for a while a full-time political agitator, campaigning for peace and against conscription. His activities attracted the attention of the British authorities, who regarded him as subversive. He was twice taken to court, the second time to receive a sentence of six months in prison, which he served at the end of the war. In 1916, as a result of his antiwar campaigning, Russell was dismissed from his lectureship at Trinity College. Although Trinity offered to rehire him after the war, he ultimately turned down the offer, preferring instead to pursue a career as a journalist and freelance writer. The war had had a profound effect on Russell\u2019s political views, causing him to abandon his inherited liberalism and to adopt a thorough-going socialism, which he espoused in a series of books including Principles of Social Reconstruction (1916), Roads to Freedom (1918), and The Prospects of Industrial Civilization (1923). He was initially sympathetic to the Russian Revolution of 1917, but a visit to the Soviet Union in 1920 left him with a deep and abiding loathing for Soviet communism, which he expressed in The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism (1920).\n\nIn 1921 Russell married his second wife, Dora Black, a young graduate of Girton College, Cambridge, with whom he had two children, John and Kate. In the interwar years Russell and Dora acquired a reputation as leaders of a progressive socialist movement that was stridently anticlerical, openly defiant of conventional sexual morality, and dedicated to educational reform. Russell\u2019s published work during this period consists mainly of journalism and popular books written in support of these causes. Many of these books\u2014such as On Education (1926), Marriage and Morals (1929), and The Conquest of Happiness (1930)\u2014enjoyed large sales and helped establish Russell in the eyes of the general public as a philosopher with important things to say about the moral, political, and social issues of the day. His public lecture \u201cWhy I Am Not a Christian,\u201d delivered in 1927 and printed many times, became a popular locus classicus of atheistic rationalism. In 1927 Russell and Dora set up their own school, Beacon Hill, as a pioneering experiment in primary education. To pay for it, Russell undertook a few lucrative but exhausting lecture tours of the United States.\n\nDuring these years Russell\u2019s second marriage came under increasing strain, partly because of overwork but chiefly because Dora chose to have two children with another man and insisted on raising them alongside John and Kate. In 1932 Russell left Dora for Patricia (\u201cPeter\u201d) Spence, a young University of Oxford undergraduate, and for the next three years his life was dominated by an extraordinarily acrimonious and complicated divorce from Dora, which was finally granted in 1935. In the following year he married Spence, and in 1937 they had a son, Conrad. Worn out by years of frenetic public activity and desiring, at this comparatively late stage in his life (he was then age 66), to return to academic philosophy, Russell gained a teaching post at the University of Chicago. From 1938 to 1944 Russell lived in the United States, where he taught at Chicago and the University of California at Los Angeles, but he was prevented from taking a post at the City College of New York because of objections to his views on sex and marriage. On the brink of financial ruin, he secured a job teaching the history of philosophy at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia. Although he soon fell out with its founder, Albert C. Barnes, and lost his job, Russell was able to turn the lectures he delivered at the foundation into a book, A History of Western Philosophy (1945), which proved to be a best-seller and was for many years his main source of income.\n\nIn 1944 Russell returned to Trinity College, where he lectured on the ideas that formed his last major contribution to philosophy, Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits (1948). During this period Russell, for once in his life, found favour with the authorities, and he received many official tributes, including the Order of Merit in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950. His private life, however, remained as turbulent as ever, and he left his third wife in 1949. For a while he shared a house in Richmond upon Thames, London, with the family of his son John and, forsaking both philosophy and politics, dedicated himself to writing short stories. Despite his famously immaculate prose style, Russell did not have a talent for writing great fiction, and his short stories were generally greeted with an embarrassed and puzzled silence, even by his admirers.\n\nIn 1952 Russell married his fourth wife, Edith Finch, and finally, at the age of 80, found lasting marital harmony. Russell devoted his last years to campaigning against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War, assuming once again the role of gadfly of the establishment. The sight of Russell in extreme old age taking his place in mass demonstrations and inciting young people to civil disobedience through his passionate rhetoric inspired a new generation of admirers. Their admiration only increased when in 1961 the British judiciary system took the extraordinary step of sentencing the 89-year-old Russell to a second period of imprisonment.\n\nWhen he died in 1970 Russell was far better known as an antiwar campaigner than as a philosopher of mathematics. In retrospect, however, it is possible to see that it is for his great contributions to philosophy that he will be remembered and honoured by future generations."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiart.org/en/john-russell/", "page_content": "John Russell RA (29 March 1745 \u2013 20 April 1806) was an English painter renowned for his portrait work in oils and pastels, and as a writer and teacher of painting techniques.\n\n\n\nRussell was born in Guildford, Surrey, the son of John Russell Snr., book and print seller and five times mayor of the town; his father was something of an artist, and drew and published two views of Guildford. Russell was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and soon showed a strong inclination for art. He trained under Francis Cotes RA (of Cavendish Square, London), one of the pioneers of English pastel painting, and, like Cotes, was an admirer of the pastel drawings of Rosalba Carriera whose methods influenced his technique of \"sweetening\". At the age of 19 he converted to Methodism, which was the cause of tension with his family and with his teacher; he made no secret of his strong evangelical leanings and would attempt to preach and convert at every opportunity.\n\n\n\nRussell set up his own studio, in London, in 1767. He made the acquaintance of the notorious Dr. William Dodd, whose portrait he painted in 1768. He was introduced to Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, who unsuccessfully attempted to persuade him to give up painting and attend her Methodist ministers' training college at Trevecca in Wales. On 5 February 1770, he married Hannah Faden, daughter of a Charing Cross print and map seller, whom he had converted. They lived at No. 7 Mortimer Street, Cavendish Square, where he had moved in 1770.\n\n\n\nRussell's work caused him to travel extensively around Britain. In 1772, he wrote Elements of Painting with Crayons, by which time he had won premiums for his drawings from the Society of Arts in 1759 and 1760, and entered the Royal Academy school of art in 1770, winning its gold medal for figure drawing the same year. He exhibited at the Society of Artists of Great Britain in 1768 and showed 330 works at the Academy between 1769 until and his death.\n\n\n\nIn 1770, Russell painted Methodist minister, George Whitefield (engraved by James Watson) and the future philanthropist, William Wilberforce, then only eleven years old. In 1771, he exhibited a portrait in oils of Charles Wesley at the Royal Academy and, in 1772, painted Selina, Countess of Huntingdon in pastel. This was a symbolic picture, and was lost on its voyage out; but it was engraved, and he later also painted her in oils. Also in that year he was elected an associate of the Royal Academy. The following year, 1773, he painted John Wesley (engraved by Bland).\n\n\n\nIn 1788, after a long wait, Russell was elected a royal academician, in the same year painting a portrait of the naturalist Sir Joseph Banks. In 1789, he was commissioned to portray the royal physician Francis Willis. The results obviously pleased the monarch as, in 1790, he was appointed Crayon (pastel) Painter to King George III, Queen Charlotte, the Prince of Wales (both of whom Russell also painted) and the Duke of York. With such royal patronage, he developed a large and fashionable clientele.\n\nThis is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Any new worthwhile artwork is directly influenced by its predecessors, and it was new art, more than anything else, that kept the Old Masters alive and relevant.\n\nWhen it came to art criticism, Russell believed that every artist, no matter what their medium or technique, is worthy of receiving the same degree of attention and diligence in a review.

Although seldom cited in the annals of Abstract Expressionist history, Russell's work as a critic was crucial to the continued enthusiasm for modern art well into the 1970s and 80s. Known paradoxically as a tough-minded critic who was nevertheless, perhaps a little too lenient when it came to newer movements in art, Russell wore two masks as an art critic: He was a champion of newer, younger artists like David Hockney and Howard Hodgkin, and was also an accomplished scholar of the Impressionists and subsequent modern movements.Raised by his grandparents in London, Russell attended St. Paul's School and then moved on to study philosophy and economics at Magdalen College at Oxford, where he earned his B.A. in 1940.Russell was interning at the Tate Gallery when the Germans bombed London during the Blitzkrieg of 1940. He was then evacuated to the country town of Worcestershire.Between 1942 and 1945, Russell served in the British Admiralty for the Naval Division. While serving, Russell met the author and journalist Ian Fleming (famous for creating the James Bond novels), who recommended Russell to theas a book reviewer. Now with the, Russell began his career as a professional critic, covering not only books but also art, theater and music.In 1950, the art critic for thewas fired for writing a negative review of an exhibition at the British Royal Academy, and Russell was subsequently promoted to chief art critic. That same year, he also became a corresponding art critic for theDuring the 1950s, Russell took on a diverse and vast amount of writing assignments, and published several books, including a travel book on Switzerland in '50, a biography of the classical Austrian conductor Erich Kleiber in '56, and a history of the city of Paris in 1960.Between 1958 and 1968, Russell sat on the art panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain. During this time, the critic played an integral role in curating several exhibitions, including three at the Tate in London (Modigliani, Rouault, and Balthus), and one at the Hayward Gallery in London ().In 1965, Russell wrote a book on Seurat, which many consider to be his best work. A few years later, in 1971, Russell oversaw a traveling exhibition devoted to Vuillard that went from Toronto to Chicago and ended in San Francisco.In 1974, Russell was recruited by thechief art critic Hilton Kramer (who had replaced John Canaday) to move to the U.S. and become a resident art critic. Russell would later become the chief art critic in 1982, a position he held until 1990.In 1975, Russell got married (for a third time) to Rosamond Bernier, an art critic and editor for the Paris magazine, who had recruited Russell to write for the magazine back in the mid-50s. They were married in Philip Johnson's famous Glass House in New Canaan, CT. Pierre Matisse (Henri's son) was the best man, and Leonard Bernstein wrote the wedding march.Russell may have left his chief critic post at thein 1990, but this was no retirement. He continued writing for the, as well as several guest reviews for theBetween 1981 and 2006 Russell edited theon behalf of The Century Association, a New York organization of some two-thousand authors and artists.He died in a Bronx nursing home in 2008 at the age of 89.Russell was not well-known for his prowess as an art historian or scholar, but his work as a critic and author suggest a vast catalogue of knowledge, not to mention an undying appreciation for art in all its forms. He had the unique ability to look at something and instantly know who and what inspired the artist. As a writer, he was quick-witted, elegant and extremely learned, and above all, he communicated the message that all great art is connected by its ability to give generation after generation a sense of who they are.Russell was remembered by artists and other art writers as someone who paid very close attention to the smallest of details and the grandest of visions and, according to the artist Howard Hodgkin, he \"was very determined to make his own criticism as valuable as possible, which meant never selling an artist short by conferring easy or less than deserved praise on his work.\"Much like Baudelaire in 1840, Russell recognized that in his time, new art was being produced at an ever-accelerating rate. As the modern world continued racing ahead, people discovered new needs, and many turned to art to meet those needs. Russell wrote: \"In art, equally, we had needs which could not be satisfied by the Old Masters, because those needs did not exist when the Old Masters were around.\" While there are critics who inevitably reach an end-point where all new art ceases to appear relevant or even good, as was the case with Harold Rosenberg and arguably Robert Hughes, Russell was quite different. For all the greatness of the Old Masters, he felt obliged to appreciate new art because, as history had taught him, when there's a need that can only be satisfied by the beauty of a Munch or Kandinsky, looking at a Manet simply will not do.Like the rest of the art world, Russell clearly saw that no uniquely American art movement had been able to sustain itself prior to 1945. But what fascinated the critic was justAmerica redefined itself in terms of the arts and modernism after World War II. Russell looked deep into American cultural and literary lore to find the roots of modern art, citing Thoreau's, Whitman's, Eliot's, and the various writings of Poe, all as chief precursors to the modern visual revolution that came about in the mid-20th century.In the section of his bookentitled, Russell wrote: \"It would have been difficult, in any case, for American painters to rival the epical assurance with which both Whitman and Melville addressed themselves to an expanding America.\" What changed all of this, in Russell's view, was New York City's arrival as the capital of modern art production, for both native-born Americans and people like himself; emigrants who flocked to New York to become part of the burgeoning art world. \"There are,\" wrote Russell, \"as many New Yorks as there are New Yorkers. New York is a self-devouring, self-renewing city, with which we come to terms as best we can. It is one of the supreme subjects of our century: one for which we would wish Balzac, Dickens and Proust to have been born again.\"Russell didn't believe that Action Painting's arrival as a leading American art form was merely a coincidence, nor did he completely share Harold Rosenberg's view that it was the product of improvised action from the artist's unconscious (a belief that led many to conclude Action Painting was melodramatic and self-indulgent). Russell looked further back in time to pinpoint Action Painting's relevance. \"It arose from an intelligent examination,\" wrote Russell, \"on the part of people who had been serious artists for nearly half a lifetime, as to just why so much of European painting had run itself into the ground. And it stood for an idea current in public life also: that human nature had not said its last word.\"In the paintings of de Kooning, Rauschenberg, Still, and others, Russell shared Rosenberg's view of Action Painting's evolution. These images were \"generated by the very act of applying the paint, without conscious reference to anything in the world outside the studio and with concessions to the divide which once separated painting from drawing, foreground from background and light from shadow.\" But Russell firmly believed there was something learned and psychologically profound in these images; an expressive force that had sprung out of years and years of studying Kandinsky, Klee and L\u00e9ger.Russell wrote of the Abstract Expressionists: \"To speak of them as 'a school' is a matter more of convenience than of historical truth. Yet one thing was common to all of them, and common to most thinking people in the late 1940s: a feeling of 'either/or.' In art, as in so many other departments of life, humanity was being given a fresh start. It was time to stand up and be counted; the question at issue was (or seemed to be)a decisive shift in sensibilitya genteel continuance.\"Russell was not content to group artists like Johns and Rauschenberg with others like Pollock and de Kooning. He saw greatness in all their works, but believed it inaccurate to place them in the same movement or \"school.\" Whereas the so-called Action Painters (Pollock and de Kooning) had supposedly blocked out the world outside the studio in order to work their canvases, there were others who welcomed the world into their work. In writing about Rauschenberg, Russell said: \"He saw it as the function of the artist to work with what is given; and in paintings .. he sieved the dredged filth of New York City as a prospector sieves the sand of the riverbed: for gold.\"As Pop art made its way onto the scene in the late 1950s, Russell saw yet another new occasion for optimism in American modern art. In his writings on Warhol, Lichtenstein and Rosenquist, Russell said, \"There was in Pop art an element of exorcism. It was made to banish evil memories, or to hoist them to a level on which they would lose their power to degrade.\"But Russell's optimism stretched far beyond the boundaries of Pop or Op art. He was always excited by how modern art constantly reinvented itself, and found new ways to draw from historical influences, yet avoided becoming tired and repetitive. New experiments in the application of space and color (found in the works of Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland), and the use of new instruments in art (installation, landscapes, found objects, etc.) were all things that motivated the critic to keep writing and praising art as modernism faded and postmodernism arose, long after the writings of critics like Greenberg and Rosenberg had ceased being relevant.In particular, Russell was a huge champion of David Smith, who the critic claimed \"may have been the last major artist to have an absolutely explicit, constructive and sanguine conception of the future of art.\" While it's true that Russell appeared to have loved just about everyone (in reality this is an overstatement), he reserved his greatest praise for those select few who represented the complete artist; one who embodied the past, present and future of Modern art.Russell was revered for his talent as a natural writer. He wrote in a very persuasive, witty tone that his readers found comforting and relatable. Unlike hispredecessor, John Canaday, Russell was not a controversial writer. In fact, some have criticized Russell for being too accepting of most forms of Modern art, and not being critical enough. (There are moments while reading Russell when one may get the impression that he liked just about every work of art he came in contact with.) But the supposed mystery behind Russell's ubiquitous praise was his very keen eye, and a mind that seemed to be its own reference library. Whenever he looked at something, it seemed as though he accessed a dozen or so other works of art. He saw influences right away; nothing was without precedent.Writing in a rhythmic and elegant style that is reminiscent of Gertrude Stein or his fellow countryman Roger Fry, Russell's primary objective in his writing wasn't to promote the arts that were already popular, but to draw well-deserved attention to some of the lesser-known artists in whose work he saw great potential.\"Art in New York was one of the driving, generative forces in the city's cultural life.\"\"It is the highest function of art to tell us who we are.\"\"Modernism is not something that can be learned step by step, like bookkeeping.\"\"I think that art should be allowed to go private. It should be a matter of one-on-one. In the last few years, the public has only heard of art when it makes record prices at auction, or is stolen, or allegedly withheld from its rightful owners. We need to concentrate more on art that sits still some place and minds its own business.\"\"It is difficult in the United States of America to make a mystique of something that has neither social status nor academic status and doesn't make any money.\""}], "John Russell was awarded the Victoria Cross.": [{"url": "https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/victoria-cross", "page_content": "Open to all\n\nThe VC is Britain's joint-highest award for gallantry.

This total includes three bars granted to soldiers who won a second VC and the cross awarded to the Unknown American soldier. During the First World War (1914-18), 626 VCs were awarded and in the Second World War (1939-45) 181.\n\nThe most recent was awarded to Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey of 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment, whose VC was gazetted in February 2015, following an action in Afghanistan on 22 August 2013."}, {"url": "https://www.historynet.com/how-the-victoria-cross-was-created/", "page_content": "On June 24, 1854, eight months into the Crimean War, Vice Adm. Sir Charles Napier, commander of Britain\u2019s Baltic Fleet, sent three ships including the wooden paddleboat HMS Hecla to reconnoiter the channels and straits around the Russian fortress at Bomarsund in the Gulf of Bothnia.\n\nAs the three vessels worked their way through the Aland Islands toward the fort, they came under fire from ground forces and then from the fort itself. Shots came closer and closer to the ships until one well-aimed shell, its fuze still burning, landed on the eight-gun Hecla\u2019s quarterdeck.\n\nThe heroic action by Hecla\u2019s Midshipman and Acting Mate, Charles Davis Lucas, that happened next prompted the creation in 1856 of one of the world\u2019s most famous and coveted valor medals\u2014Great Britain and the Commonwealth\u2019s revered Victoria Cross.\n\nNo Awards For Ordinary Soldiers\n\nTwo days after Lucas\u2019 bravery saved his ship and presumably many of his shipmates, he was promoted to full lieutenant, but notably was not then given any military decoration or other award. The reason was that there was no suitable award available at that time for recognizing conspicuous bravery displayed by the British fighting man\u2014especially those of lower rank. The only available military recognitions for their gallant deeds were a promotion or a Mention in Dispatches.\n\nYet, because of new 19th century technology, such as the telegraph and concurrent burgeoning proliferation of numbers and circulation copies of newspapers, news of the war and Lucas\u2019 actions reached more public readership than ever before. Capturing widespread public attention, news of Lucas\u2019 exploits\u2014and soon of other Crimean War British heroes\u2014unleashed a clamor demanding more honor be given to the average fighting man.\n\nMedals and Knighthoods\u2014For a Few People\n\nMedals, military and otherwise, were not a new thing. A half-century before the Crimean War and long before Lucas\u2019 act of courage, Napoleon himself noted that \u201ca soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon.\u201d\n\nAncient Egypt honored prowess at arms not with \u201cbits of colored ribbon\u201d but with membership in military orders, while Roman legionaries were honored with various crowns such as a naval crown awarded to the first man to board an enemy ship during battle. For centuries there were chivalric awards of knighthood and membership in various aristocratic military orders with their attendant sashes, stars, and badges. Britain\u2019s Most Noble Order of the Garter was established in 1348 by Edward III, and King George I created the Most Honourable Order of the Bath in 1725; both are knighthood orders.\n\nFrom left: Top distinctions in the British honors system include chivalric orders with medieval roots such as the Order of the Garter and the Order of the Bath, both knighthoods that can be conferred for military as well as civic merit. The Victoria Cross, the brainchild of Prince Albert, was an entirely new concept for the British system and promoted equality. (from left: British Museum (2); Department of National Defence, Canada)\n\nThe first award that could truly be called \u201ca medal\u201d was the medal that John VIII Palaeologuscreated in Italy in 1438 and presented to court officials in Milan, Ferrara, Naples, Mantua, and Rimini. France also produced medals in the 15th century, and the Netherlands awarded a medal in 1519. In Britain, Queen Elizabeth I issued a commemorative medal in 1588 to mark the defeat of the Spanish Armada that year. Commemorative medals were also awarded to veterans of Napoleon\u2019s 1798 Battle of the Nile. Prussia\u2019s Frederick William III created a precursor of the Allgemeines Ehrenzeichen in 1793 for peacetime merit.\n\nGen. George Washington, commander-in-chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolution, created the Badge for Military Merit in 1782. Awarded to three men, it was forgotten until 1932 when U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Douglas MacArthur created its rededication as the Purple Heart medal. America\u2019s Medal of Honor, its highest valor decoration, was established by the War Department in July 1862 (December 1861 by the Navy Department) during the American Civil War.\n\nFrance\u2019s Napoleon III established the green and yellow Medaille Militaire award in 1852, one of the first awards made available to noncommissioned officers. The French even presented these medals to British soldiers during the Crimean War. However, Britain lagged in the creation of an individual medal for valor.\n\nEnter the Crimean War\n\nThe Crimean War changed that. The war started in October 1853 between Russia and Turkey (the Ottoman Empire then). By March 1854, Britain and France had been swept into the conflict on Turkey\u2019s side. That summer, the British Admiralty sent Napier and his Baltic Fleet into the Baltic Sea.\n\nIn June, Lucas\u2019 act of heroism was prompted by Napier\u2019s dispatch of the warships Hecla, Odin, and Valorous under Capt. William H. Hall to reconnoiter the scattered islands and approaches to the 80-gun Russian fortress at Bomarsund. As the three vessels worked a narrow channel near the 1832 fortress and came under fire, Hall, in an action some in the Admiralty later called \u201cfoolish,\u201d returned fire and eventually attacked the fortress itself.\n\nLucas was then in charge of the paddleboat\u2019s eight guns. When evening arrived, the three ships, joined by the 46-gun HMS Arrogant, dropped anchor within range of the fortress and launched a bombardment that lasted into the early hours of the following morning.\n\nLucas Saves the Day\n\nDuring the height of this bombardment, a live shell landed on the Hecla\u2019s upper deck\u2014it\u2019s timed fuze still burning its way to ignite the shell\u2019s inner explosive charge. Officers scrambled and shouted for their men to hit the deck.\n\nIgnoring the shouts, Lucas grabbed the hissing, sputtering shell with both hands, carried it to the rail, and threw it overboard. Before the shell reached the water, it exploded \u201cwith a tremendous roar.\u201d That action, Capt. Hall of the Hecla later reported, saved \u201cdozens of lives if not the whole ship\u2019s company.\u201d Lucas\u2019 heroics had saved the Hecla\u2019s crew, although the ship suffered minor damage and two crewmen were wounded.\n\nHistorian Glanfield explains in his book about the Victoria Cross, Bravest of the Brave, that at the time \u201cexplosive shells were essentially hollowed cannon balls powder-filled and primitively fuzed\u201d with fuzes \u201ccut to length by its gunners according to range to ensure it exploded close on impact.\u201d Lucas was himself a gunner, Glanfield wrote, and thus knew the risks. He \u201cwas gambling on a miscalculation.\u201d It was a gamble he fortunately won. British and French forces would finally take the Bomarsund fortress and demolish it in August.\n\nThis depiction of Charles Davis Lucas shows him hurling an explosive shell from the deck of his ship to save those on board. The public demanded greater recognition for his courage. (National Maritime Museum, Greenwich)\n\nLucas, then age 20, was already a navy veteran. He was born in 1834 in Poyntzpass, County Armagh, in today\u2019s Northern Ireland and at age 13 joined the Royal Navy. He was praised by Hall for \u201ca remarkable instance of coolness and presence of mind in action,\u201d in Hall\u2019s letter to Napier.\n\nClamor for ordinary heroes\n\nBy 1854, newspapers had proliferated. Samuel F. B. Morse had sent the first telegraph message a decade earlier, on May 24, 1842. Consequently, the Crimean War was the first major conflict covered by war correspondents who brought the British public into almost daily contact with the war via telegraph. Correspondents such as William Howard Russell of The Times included coverage of common soldiers and sailors.\n\nThe people back home read in their newspapers of the suffering of their husbands, sons, and brothers, the inadequacies of the medical care they were receiving, poor sanitation, and heroics. They devoured war reports including news of the Bomarsund fighting and of Lucas\u2019 gallantry on the Hecla. Both became topics of public conversation in pubs and on city street corners throughout the kingdom.\n\n\u201cThe war reports of Russell and other journalists,\u201d history professor Orlando Figes wrote in 2010, \u201chad brought to the attention of the British public the many acts of bravery by ordinary troops; [and] they had portrayed the suffering of the soldiers in heroic terms giving rise to a widespread feeling that a new reward was needed to recognize their deeds.\u201d\n\nThe Distinguished Conduct Medal for army enlisted men and the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal for seamen were quickly established but, Glanfield wrote, \u201cfailed to meet the demand for a single supreme award embracing all ranks and all arms.\u201d\n\nA New Award For All\u2014Opposed By Some\n\nQueen Victoria\u2019s husband, Prince Albert, aware of these news reports and of the public clamor they aroused\u2014and perhaps embarrassed by British soldiers receiving the French Medaille Militaire\u2014began drawing up specifications in 1855 for a gallantry award he proposed to call the Military Order of Victoria (changed to Victoria Cross by the Queen). His proposal included five points: that a small cross of merit for personal deeds of valor be established; that it be open to all ranks; that it be unlimited in number; that an annuity (he suggested 5\u00a3) be attached to each cross; and that it could be claimed by an individual who established his right to the distinction before a jury of his peers, subject to confirmation by the Crown.\n\nWhen word leaked out, the proposed award was celebrated by Parliament and the British public. However, some entrenched elements of the military opposed it, arguing that courage was expected of all soldiers and that an award should not be established honoring someone for doing what was expected.\n\nYet such scruples could not hold against Albert\u2019s idea, backed by his sizeable prestige and championed by Queen Victoria herself. The House of Commons joined the movement for the Victoria Cross in December, when retired naval officer and MP Capt. George Treweeke Scobell urged the Queen to create \u201can order of merit for distinguished and prominent personal gallantry to which every grade and individual from the highest to the lowest may be admissible\u201d and proposing the medal carry a yearly annuity of \u00a310, rather than Prince Albert\u2019s originally proposed \u00a35.\n\nThe Victoria Cross Is Born\n\nThe medal was instituted in 1856 when the Queen signed its warrant on Jan. 29. It was made retroactive to 1854 available \u201cto a person of any rank in any service and to any civilians under military command.\u201d The medal was first created by the gold and silver smiths of Hancocks & Co. of London, which still manufactures the medals today. It was most likely designed by the sculptor Henry Armstead, then age 27.\n\nThe new valor award came about due to the teamwork of Prince Albert and Queen Victoria. Although the VC was Albert\u2019s idea, Victoria introduced modifications to it and lent her full support to its creation, overcoming opposition. (Royal Collection Trust)\n\nThe bronze medal is described as being in the shape of a Maltese cross (actually, a cross patt\u00e9e is used), slightly more than one-and-a-half inches high and the same in width. The front bears an imprint of St. Edward\u2019s crown with a British lion above and the slogan \u201cFor Valour\u201d below. The slogan originally considered for the medal was \u201cFor The Brave,\u201d but that was changed to \u201cFor Valour\u201d on Victoria\u2019s suggestion, noting that the original slogan seemed to imply that not all men were brave in battle. The cross hangs from a gold bar on the obverse. On the reverse is inscribed the recipient\u2019s name, rank, number, and unit. The date on which the act for which the award is being presented is engraved on the back of the bronze cross. The cross in turn hangs from the gold bar and a crimson ribbon about one-and-a-half inches wide.\n\nOriginally a Victoria Cross with a crimson ribbon (officially prescribed as \u201cred\u201d but which has always been \u201ccrimson\u201d or \u201cwine-red\u201d in color) was awarded to army honorees while one with a dark blue ribbon was given to navy honorees until all subsequent Victoria Cross medals were issued in crimson after 1918. Since 1917 a miniature of the cross can be seen in the center of the bar.\n\nMade from a cannon?\n\nIn the few cases (three to date) in which two VCs have been awarded to a single individual, a second miniature cross is placed next to the first. The three double-winners are: Surgeon Capt. Arthur Martin-Leake, who won one VC in the Boer War and one in World War I; Capt. Noel Godfrey Chavasse, who won two in World War I; and New Zealander Capt. Charles Hazlitt Upham, who won two in World War II.\n\nTo date, the Victoria Cross has been awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 individuals with almost half, 628, awarded for actions taken during World War I and 181 in World War II. Since the end of World War II, 15 VCs have been awarded: four in the Korean War; one for Malaya; four (to Australians) in the Vietnam War; two in the Falklands War; one in the Iraq War; and three in the War in Afghanistan. All 15 medals have been awarded to military personnel. No British civilian has received the award since 1879.\n\nWomen became eligible for the Victoria Cross in 1921. However, no woman has yet been awarded one, although Elizabeth Webber Harris, a colonel\u2019s wife serving with her husband in India, was awarded an \u201chonorary\u201d VC for heroic efforts treating victims of an 1869 cholera epidemic. By comparison, the United States\u2019 highest military honor, the Medal of Honor, first awarded during the American Civil War, has been presented 3,511 times, including 19 medals to individuals who have received two. It was also awarded to one woman, Dr. Mary Edwards Walker, a Civil War physician.\n\nIt was claimed that Victoria Crosses have all been made from the metal of Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol in the Crimean War, but historian Glanfield, after studying a metallurgical examination of VCs in the custody of the Australian War Memorial, authoritatively established that Victoria Crosses\u2014at least those made since December 1914\u2014come from the metal of two Chinese cannons. Enough metal from that source is still available to make 80 to 85 more Victoria Crosses. The metal is kept in a vault controlled by the Royal Logistics Corps at Donnington, Shropshire and can be removed from the vault only in the presence of an officer and armed guards.\n\nFirst Presented by Queen Victoria\n\nNormally, a recommendation for the awarding of a Victoria Cross is issued by an officer at the regimental level with a minimum of three witnesses swearing to the accuracy of the claims of heroism for which it is intended. The recommendation must then work its way up the chain of command until it reaches, first, the Secretary of State for Defense and then the reigning monarch for approval.\n\nIn 1867, the award also was made available to colonial troops. After World War II, most Commonwealth countries created their own system of military awards, which often include a Victoria Cross medal created by that country and no longer directly take part in Great Britain\u2019s medals system. However the UK government can recommend Commonwealth citizens for UK honors, and the British monarch is also the sovereign of certain Commonwealth honors systems, such as those of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\n\nInitial official policy was that posthumous VC awards should not be made. Between 1897 and 1901, as British soldiers fought in colonial wars and in China\u2019s Boxer Rebellion, the London Gazette listed soldiers who would have been awarded VCs had they survived. In 1902, six of those soldiers mentioned in the Gazette were \u201cunofficially\u201d granted VCs and later awarded medals after the policy prohibiting posthumous VCs was officially reversed in 1920.\n\nThe first 62 Victoria Crosses were presented to honorees personally by the queen in London\u2019s Hyde Park during a ceremony on June 26, 1857. Lucas was the first to receive the medal. (Royal Collection Trust)\n\nThe Victoria Cross warrant does not specify who should present the actual medals to the honorees. Queen Victoria liked to present them herself and presented the first 62 awarded. That presentation took place on a hot June 26, 1857 in London\u2019s Hyde Park before massed British troops, including dragoons, hussars, a troop of Royal Horse Artillery with two field batteries, Royal Engineers, three battalions of Foot Guards, and others. A large crowd gathered and cheered loudly as the troops formed and the 62 men about to be awarded the VC marched and stood in a single line facing the troops and a table holding the medals.\n\nLucas was fourth in the line that had been formed by rank. Just before 10 a.m., the field batteries sounded, and the Queen approached on horseback accompanied by Albert, who that very day had received the title of Queen\u2019s Consort. Also present on horseback were the Prince of Wales, who would become Edward VII, and his brother Alfred. Sir John Smyth has called the scene \u201cpoignant and impressive.\u201d\n\nHow the VC Changed views About Soldiers\n\nAmong the honorees were 26 men from the lower ranks: 16 army privates; four gunners; one sapper; two seaman; and three boatswains. Besides Lucas, two other men from the Hecla also received VCs that day, Lt. John Bythesea and Stoker William Johnstone. The first man to receive his medal was the redoubtable Charles David Lucas.\n\nThe medals appear to have been awarded chronologically by the date of the action for which they were being awarded. Lord Panmure, Secretary of State for War, called the name of each man and handed the proper individually-inscribed medal to the Queen. The man then stepped forward, bowed to the Queen, and Victoria leaned from her saddle and pinned the medal to the man\u2019s chest.\n\nAfter the ceremony Lucas remained in the Royal Navy, was promoted in 1862 and for a time commanded the experimental armored gunboat HMS Vixen. He was promoted to captain in 1867, retired in October 1873, and was named a rear admiral after his retirement. Five years later, in 1878, he was summoned to the deathbed of his former captain, Adm. Sir William Hutcheson Hall, who asked Lucas to take care of his wife Hilaire after he was gone and to marry his only daughter, Frances Russell Hall. Always loyal, Lucas complied, marrying Frances in 1879. The couple went on to have three daughters before Lucas died at Great Culverden, Kent on Aug. 7, 1914. He is buried at St. Lawrence\u2019s Church, Mereworth, Maidstone, Kent.\n\nSince its first en masse award in 1857, the Victoria Cross has become not only Great Britain\u2019s highest military honor, but one of the world\u2019s most prestigious valor medals. The late author Sir John Smyth, who won a Victoria Cross in France during World War I, has called it \u201cthe most famous award for gallantry in the world\u201d while historian Glanfield has called it \u201cBritain\u2019s supreme decoration.\u201d\n\nThe award also changed perceptions about ordinary soldiers. \u201cBefore the war,\u201d Prof. Orlando Figes wrote, \u201cthe respectable middle and upper classes had viewed the rank and file of the British Army as little more than a dissolute rabble\u2014heavy-drinking and ill-disciplined, brutal and profane.\u201d But no longer. The Victoria Cross \u201cmarked a new reverence for war and warriors.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.ramcassociation.org.uk/about/history-main/medical-victoria-crosses", "page_content": "Medical Victoria Crosses - General Introduction\n\nThe Victoria Cross (VC) is the highest and most prestigious award of the British honours system. It is awarded for valour \"in the presence of the enemy\" to members of the British Armed Forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two-thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe VC was introduced on 29 January 1856 by Queen Victoria to honour acts of valour during the Crimean War. Since then, the medal has been awarded 1,358 times to 1,355 individual recipients. Only 15 medals, of which 11 were to members of the British Army and four were to members of the Australian Army, have been awarded since the Second World War. The traditional explanation of the source of the metal from which the medals are struck is that it derives from Russian cannon captured at the Siege of Sevastopol. However, research has suggested another origin for the material. Historian John Glanfield has established that the metal for most of the medals made since December 1914 came from two Chinese cannon, and that there is no evidence of Russian origin.\n\nOwing to its rarity, the VC is highly prized and the medal has fetched over \u00a3400,000 at auction. A number of public and private collections are devoted to the Victoria Cross. The private collection of Lord Ashcroft, amassed since 1986, contains over one-tenth of all VCs awarded. Following a 2008 donation to the Imperial War Museum, the Ashcroft collection went on public display alongside the museum's Victoria and George Cross collection in November 2010.\n\nMedical Foreword by Alistair Macmillan\n\nTHE ARMY MEDICAL SERVICES\u2019 VC s\n\nSince its inception in 1856, members of the Army Medical Services have been awarded UK\u2019s highest award for valour. This started off at the Battle of Balaclava and the lineage stretches through to the last year of World War 2. The story of each and every medical awardee is included in this collection on the RAMC Association website. It is a remarkable tale featuring as it does an exclusive company of non-combatants who, regardless, were exposed to enemy fire and showed extraordinary bravery in tending and rescuing the wounded on the battlefield. The list features some 29 awardees from the UK and is embellished by a further 10 who served with Empire troops on medical duty \u2013 mainly alongside their British confreres. This is not the largest list of VC awardees, that privilege is reserved to the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers, although through the number of infantry regiment amalgamations that have happened over the last 50 years, some of these new aggregates are exceeding those ancient Corps\u2019 totals as well as our own.\n\nTurning to the data in more detail. There have only been three awards of the VC and Bar; two of these are to medical officers (Martin-Leake and Chavasse) thus bringing the 29 UK total to 31 awards. The early awardees served directly as members of their regiments and the Royal Artillery, so you will find their names on those other lists as well. The regimental medical officers, apart from the Household Troops ones, only passed to the Army Medical Department in 1873. The RAMC was then formed as late as 1898 and so only 14 of the 31 were wearing that cap badge at the time. Six awardees (Ranken, Green, Chavasse, Fox-Russell, Andrews, Harden) have given their lives in earning their accolade and another (Ackroyd) was killed in a separate battlefield incident after his bravery but before the citation was announced. Only three awards have been to soldiers (Fitzgibbon, Farmer, Harden), the rest are all to medical officers. Fitzgibbon is believed to be the youngest ever recipient of the award. Manley has a unique story line of his own as he was also awarded the Prussian Iron Cross and the French Croix de Secours aux Blesses during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Campbell Douglas was awarded after that rare phenomenon of a rescue at sea and not under fire. For the sake of completion it should be mentioned that there is one Royal Naval Medical Service awardee, Surgeon William Job Maillard, who earned the VC at Crete in 1898.\n\nThe Museum of Military Medicine holds 21 of the 39 medals awarded to medical staff and a further 12 are on display at other museums at home (plus Maillard\u2019s) and abroad. Five remain in private hands and the whereabouts of Fitzgibbons\u2019 one is not known but it is suspected that it was buried with him at the end of his life. However, there is one more VC in the collection not yet mentioned. When Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone at Netley Hospital in 1856 she buried beneath it an unmarked VC medal. After the hospital was finally demolished in 1966 this was recovered, and it is also on display at the Museum of Military Medicine alongside the other 21. It is believed that this was the first VC ever struck as its placement predated the initial award presentation parade in Hyde Park. It had been suggested that it wasn\u2019t real as it didn\u2019t have a name and date inscribed on it so the Colonels Commandant RAMC had it duly inscribed in 1967.\n\nPhil Basford is to be congratulated for his painstaking compilation of the data, this website now holds, concerning the medical VCs. With each entry there are links and additional information, beyond the citation, to flesh out the individual stories.

On 9 August Carroll embarked at Fremantle on HMAT A28 Miltiades, arriving at Plymouth, England on 25 September.\n\n\n\nIn late November, he was transferred to 33 Battalion (33Bn) under Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Morshead, and proceeded with the battalion to France. Originally billeted in the \u2018quiet\u2019 Armentieres sector, the battalion was moved across the border into Belgium in May 1917. In June, the 3rd Australian Division under Major General John Monash, including 33Bn, took part in the Battle of Messines Ridge, a strategic and well fortified position which had been held by the Germans since 1914.\n\n\n\nPreparations for the Messines offensive had begun over a year earlier with the development of deep tunnels under the German lines which, by the time of the attack, housed over 930,000 pounds of high explosive in over 20 enormous mines. The Australian division was charged with the capture of the southern shoulder of Messines Ridge, the far right of the Allied push.\n\n\n\nAt 03.10 am on the morning of 7 June, nineteen of the mines were detonated, virtually destroying the ridge and much of the German front line. This was accompanied by a creeping barrage of heavy artillery followed closely by the Australian infantry troops. Historian Charles Bean wrote that following the detonation of the mines \u2018...the only point at which resistance worthy of the name had been felt was...on the extreme right.\u2019\n\n\n\nUnlike other units in the Allied offensive pushing through an initially shocked and demoralised German front line, sections of 33Bn met spirited resistance as it moved forward on the extreme right flank. Carroll immediately rushed the enemy trenches and bayoneted four Germans before killing another that was threatening a comrade. Moving forward he then rushed an enemy machine gun post, killing the three Germans manning the post and capturing the gun. The battalion was on the line continuously for four days and Carroll\u2019s determination was evident throughout. By the time the battalion was relieved on 11 June it had suffered almost 370 casualties. For his actions during the Battle of Messines Ridge, Carroll was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). The recommendation for the award reads:\n\n\n\nFor most conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. In the Battle of Messines Ridge on June 7th Private John CARROLL acted as a mopper-up. Immediately the barrage lifted he rushed the enemy's trench and bayoneted four Germans. He then noticed a comrade in difficulties with one of the enemy and he at once proceeded to his comrade's assistance and killed the German. He continued working ahead with grim determination and wonderful fearlessness, and came across a machine gun and team of four men in a shell hole; they offered resistance but single-handed he attacked the entire team, killed them all and captured the gun. Later two of his comrades were buried by a shell, and in spite of very heavy shelling and machine gun fire he extricated them. During the 96 hours the Battalion was in the line Pte Carroll displayed most wonderful courage and fearlessness. Each night he went out wiring in front of the new line and did excellent work. On two occasions he brought wounded men back to our line. His magnificent example inspired the whole battalion.'\n\n\n\nCarroll was wounded in the chest on 9 July while part of a working party in the forward areas after 33Bn had relieved 35Bn on Messines Ridge. He was evacuated to Boulogne and, following hospitalisation, rejoined his unit on 19 August. A month later he was promoted to lance corporal. Carroll was again wounded in action during the disastrous First Battle of Passchendaele on 12 October. This wound effectively spelt the end of his active service, though he rejoined his unit in France briefly in June 1918.\n\n\n\nHe was invested with his VC at Buckingham Palace by King George V on 23 March 1918. In August, Carroll was one of ten VC recipients who returned to Australia on HMAT D21 Medic to assist with recruitment following the failure of the conscription referenda. In early November, Carroll, with fellow VC winner Lieutenant Clifford William King Sadlier, arrived in Perth to a rousing reception. His enlistment in the AIF was terminated on 1 January 1919. Following the war he returned to his occupation at Kurrawang and on 23 April 1923 married Mary Brown in Perth. They had no children.\n\n\n\nOn Anzac Day 1927, Carroll was one of twenty three VC recipients at the Anzac Commemoration Service in Melbourne which was attended by HRH Duke of York (later George VI). Later that year, following a rail accident at a timber mill at Yarloop, south of Perth, his right foot was amputated. In 1956, he was a member of the Australian contingent for the VC Centenary celebrations in London. John Carroll died on 4 October 1971 and was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth with full military honours. His VC and medals came into the Memorial\u2019s collection in 1989. His brother, Martin, also served in the AIF, as a sapper with 3 Light Railway Company."}, {"url": "http://www.victoriacross.org.uk/aahistor.htm", "page_content": "Queen Victoria caused some consternation by electing to stay on horseback throughout the ceremony of awarding the sixty-two recipients with the Cross. There is a pleasing legend that the Queen, leaning forward from the saddle like a Cossack with a lance, stabbed one of the heroes, Commander Raby, through the chest. The commander, true to the spirit in which he had won the Cross, stood unflinching while his sovereign fastened the pin through his flesh. The other sixty-one seem to have come through the occasion uninjured. The Queen managed to pin on the whole batch in just ten minutes, which does not suggest lengthy conversation, but the whole parade went off extremely well to the raptuous applause of the public.\n\nPrince Albert's influence was clearly expressed in the terms of the Royal Warrant for the Cross which has survived, with some alterations, to the present day. It was a medal awarded 'to those officers or men who have served Us in the presence of the Enemy and shall then have performed some signal act of valour or devotion to their country'. Far from striking the public as something with which to 'find fault', the new award was greeted with great enthusiasm by the British people.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/holyhead-remembers-victoria-cross-hero-13894845", "page_content": "Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nInvalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.\n\nSign up to our free newsletter for the top North Wales stories sent straight to your e-mail\n\nThe ultimate sacrifice made by one of Anglesey\u2019s two Victoria Cross recipients received prominence during Remembrance Sunday commemorations in Holyhead.\n\nCaptain John Fox Russell, 24, was posthumously awarded the honour after he was killed during the First World War and yesterday a new commemorative stone was unveiled in his name.\n\nHe was born at Plan Tanalltran, Holyhead on the January 27, 1893, the eldest child of Doctor William and Ethel Maria Fox Russell.\n\nThe Fox-Russell family home was 5, Victoria Terrace, which is just yards from Holyhead\u2019s Cenotaph where the stone was laid.\n\nNearly 100 years has passed since Captain Fox Russell\u2019s selfless actions on the battlefield of Tel el Khuweilfeh in Palestine.\n\n(Image: HANDOUT BY ANGLESEY COUNCIL)\n\nCaptain Fox Russell had earlier been awarded the Military Cross for his bravery during the first Battle of Gaza, on March 27 and 28 1917.\n\nHis Victoria Cross citation reads: \u201cFor most conspicuous bravery displayed in action until he was killed.\n\n\u201cCaptain Russell repeatedly went out to attend the wounded under murderous fire from snipers and machine guns, and in many cases where no other means were at hand carried them in himself, although almost exhausted he showed the highest possible degree of valour.\u201d\n\nThe stone\u2019s unveiling formed part of a centenary commemoration scheme by the Department for Communities and Local Government in London to honour the gallantry of the 628 recipients awarded the Victoria Crosses during the First World War, organised by Anglesey Council, Holyhead Town Council and the British Legion.\n\n(Image: HANDOUT BY ANGLESEY COUNCIL)\n\nEarlier this year a commemoration stone to mark the sacrifice of Anglesey\u2019s other son who won the Victoria Cross, Seaman William Williams, was unveiled in his hometown of Amlwch.\n\nHe was awarded the medal for his part in the sinking of a German U-boat on June 7, 1917.\n\nAnglesey Council Chairman, Cllr Richard Jones, unveiled Captain Fox Russell\u2019s memorial stone with the Mayor of Holyhead, Cllr Ann Kennedy, as some of the hero\u2019s descendents looked on.\n\nCllr Jones said, \u201cMany young men from Holyhead and Anglesey fought in the First World War and it\u2019s extremely important that we remember and honour their sacrifice a century ago.\n\n\u201cCaptain John Fox Russell gallantly served his country and put his comrades\u2019 lives before his own.\n\n\u201cHis life and bravery will be remembered, and I\u2019m sure Holyhead will value this new centenary commemoration stone in his honour.\u201d\n\nShare your views about this story using the comment section below."}, {"url": "https://www.awm.gov.au/articles/encyclopedia/vic_cross", "page_content": "The Victoria Cross is the highest award for acts of bravery in wartime.
