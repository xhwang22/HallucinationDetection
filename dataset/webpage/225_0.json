Beyond signing Iwakuma in 2012, the club successfully signed Ichiro Suzuki in \u201800 and Kikuchi in \u201819, and it was believed to be the runner-up for Shohei Ohtani in \u201917.\n\n\n\nIwakuma was among Japan\u2019s top pitchers before joining Seattle as an international free agent in 2012, having won the Pacific League MVP Award in \u201908. The right-hander retired from professional baseball in October after experiencing prolonged shoulder injuries, an issue that dated back to when he first signed with Seattle ahead of his age-31 season. His final appearances as a professional came for the Yomiuri Giants in '19.\n\n\n\nBut when healthy, Iwakuma was one of the Mariners\u2019 most effective pitchers over his six seasons in Seattle (2012-17), going 63-39 with a 3.42 ERA in 150 games, including 136 starts. The \u201813 All-Star\u2019s career ERA is tied for the lowest in club history (min. 500 innings) with Randy Johnson, Felix Hernandez and James Paxton.

Second Japanese pitcher after Nomo in \u201901,\u201d the headline of the lead story on the Sports Nippon newspaper website read.\n\nJapanese baseball fans keenly follow their players in the U.S. major leagues, and game highlights of their exploits are a staple of sports news broadcasts, and reported in the sports pages of newspapers.\n\nThe reaction is a bit more muted, though, after two decades of Japanese stars heading to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe nation went berserk when Nomo threw his two no-hitters,\u201d said Robert Whiting, the author of \u201cYou Gotta Have Wa,\u201d a book about foreign baseball players in Japan. \u201cNow, it\u2019s been there done that.\u201d\n\nIwakuma said through an interpreter after the fourth no-hitter in the major leagues this season that he couldn\u2019t find the right words to describe his feelings.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly happy,\u201d he said.\n\nIwakuma became the first American League pitcher in nearly three years to throw a no-hitter, silencing the Baltimore Orioles in the Mariners\u2019 3-0 victory on Wednesday.\n\nIwakuma\u2019s father-in-law, who used to coach on the pitcher\u2019s team in Japan, the Rakuten Eagles, was at the game.\n\n\u201cI was excited to see (fans) cheering with a standing ovation and getting ecstatic each time he pitched in the last half of the game,\u201d Koju Hirohashi said in a statement issued by the team. \u201cAlso, I was happy to be able to watch such a game in person. At the beginning, I felt his pitching was a bit rough, but powerful. His fastball and slider were good. I hope he will continue playing without any injuries.\u201d\n\nTalented but often injured since arriving from Japan in 2012, the 34-year-old Iwakuma, a native of Tokyo, didn\u2019t overpower the Orioles.\n\nThat\u2019s not his style.\n\nInstead, Iwakuma smartly used a biting splitter and precise control to throw the fourth individual no-hitter in franchise history and become the oldest pitcher since Randy Johnson in 2004 to throw a no-no.\n\nThe last AL pitcher to keep zeros across the board was teammate Felix Hernandez, who tossed a perfect game at Safeco Field on Aug. 15, 2012. Not surprisingly, Hernandez was one of the first to greet Iwakuma as he was mobbed on the pitcher\u2019s mound after the final out, wearing a fuzzy bear hat that was handed out to fans earlier in the season in a promotion to honor Iwakuma.\n\nThe right-hander struck out seven and walked three and while Austin Jackson made a solid catch for the final out, the play everyone will remember is Kyle Seager\u2019s contorting catch to open the ninth inning. Seager tracked David Lough\u2019s foul ball near the stands and made a nifty over-the-shoulder catch for the first out.\n\nIwakuma missed 2 1/2 months early in the season after straining a muscle in his back and side. He\u2019s been solid since returning and there were rumblings around the trade deadline Iwakuma might be moved.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I thought was to come back and give it all I\u2019ve got every start and make up for the lost time I had in the first half,\u201d Iwakuma said.\n\nBenjamin Lang, an American lawyer and baseball fan in Japan agreed about the muted reaction in Tokyo. \u201cMy take is that it\u2019s a different era,\u201d he said. \u201cNomo was carrying the weight of the baseball-mad Japanese public when he left for the majors. A Japanese player excelling in the majors is now old hat, and while the no-hitter will be celebrated, it simply won\u2019t have the impact that Nomo\u2019s first one had.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Tim Booth in Seattle, Washington, contributed to this report."}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Hisashi_Iwakuma", "page_content": "What we do. Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nJapanese baseball player\n\nBaseball player\n\nHisashi Iwakuma (\u5ca9\u9688 \u4e45\u5fd7, Iwakuma Hisashi, born April 12, 1981) is a Japanese former professional baseball pitcher. He has played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes from 2000 to 2004, Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles from 2005 to 2011, and Yomiuri Giants in 2019, and all of his time in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners from 2012 to 2017. Iwakuma retired in 2020 due to lingering shoulder issues that had prevented him from playing that year.\n\nIwakuma made his professional debut with the Buffaloes in 2000. He was named a NPB All-Star in 2003 and 2004, and played in the 2004 Athens Olympics. He joined the Eagles in 2005. As the Eagles' reigning staff ace, Iwakuma won the Eiji Sawamura Award in 2008, and was also a NPB All-Star that year. He appeared in the 2009 World Baseball Classic for the Japanese national team.\n\nIwakuma was posted to Major League Baseball after the 2010 season, but he failed to come to an agreement with the winning bidder. After the 2011 season, Iwakuma signed with the Mariners. He was an MLB All-Star in 2013, as well as the third-place finisher for the 2013 American League Cy Young Award.\n\nOn August 12, 2015, Iwakuma became the second Japanese player ever to pitch a no-hitter in Major League Baseball (joining Hideo Nomo, who threw two), throwing a three-walk, seven-strikeout 3\u20130 win over the Baltimore Orioles at Safeco Field.[1] It was also his first MLB complete game, and the Mariners' fifth no-hitter in team history.\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 5 Views: 108 094 516 342 25 992 15 291\n\nBAL@SEA: Iwakuma pitches a no-hitter vs. Orioles\n\nHisashi Iwakuma Fans 11 Hitters\n\nHisashi Iwakuma on the batters he feared most\n\nAll six of the Mariners' no-hitters in team history\n\nKC@SEA: Iwakuma shuts down Royals over eight innings Transcription\n\nEarly life and high school career\n\nIwakuma was born in Higashiyamato, Tokyo, and began playing baseball in the first grade before attending Horikoshi High School in Nakano.[2] Iwakuma was inspired to become a pitcher after \"looking up to\" former Seibu Lions great Hisanobu Watanabe, who was known for his big-game pitching.[3] While he never made it to a national tournament during his high school career, he led his team to the semi-finals of the West Tokyo Tournament as a senior in the summer of 1999.\n\nProfessional career\n\nOsaka Kintetsu Buffaloes\n\nThe Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes picked him in the fifth round of the 1999 NPB draft [jp].\n\nEarly years: 2000\u20132003\n\nIwakuma spent the entirety of his rookie season (2000) with the Buffaloes' nigun (Japanese for \"minor league\" or \"farm team\") team, clocking 149 km/h (93 mph) with his fastball at one point but making only two appearances all year in the Western League.\n\nIwakuma made his debut at the ichigun (\"major league\") level the following year, appearing in relief in a game against the Nippon-Ham Fighters on May 29 2001 and earning the first career win of his professional career despite giving up a run over 12\u20443 innings. He made his first start on June 10 against the Fighters and threw his first career complete game (a two-hit shutout) against the Seibu Lions on September 18, finishing the year with a 4\u20132 record and playing an important role in the Buffaloes' league title that year.\n\nIwakuma secured a spot in the team's starting rotation by 2002, the following season, going 8\u20137 with a much-improved 3.69 ERA in 141 1\u20443 innings. He enjoyed a breakout year in 2003, going 15\u201310 with a 3.45 ERA and 149 strikeouts and leading the league with 11 complete games.\n\n2004\n\nIwakuma began the 2004 season 12\u20130 and establishing a franchise record for most consecutive wins to start the season. He received the most fan votes among Pacific League starting pitchers for the NPB All-Star Game that year, starting Game 1 at Nagoya Dome on July 10, and pitched in the 2004 Athens Olympics as a member of the Japanese national team in August. He finished with a 15\u20132 record for the year, leading the league in both wins and winning percentage (.882)[4] for the first time in his career. He also pitched in Game 5 of the MLB All-Star Series held in November, holding the MLB All-Stars to one run over seven innings to earn the win.\n\nFollowing the 2004 season, Iwakuma's Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave, another Pacific League team based in the Kansai region, opted to merge to alleviate some of their financial difficulties, later leading to the addition of a new team named the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles that would fill the void created by the merger. Iwakuma was initially named a member of the newly formed Orix Buffaloes in a dispersal draft held that November, but refused to comply and join the Buffaloes and became involved in a contractual dispute.[5][6] Although the Buffaloes attempted to persuade him to play for their team, they eventually agreed to trade him to the Eagles in exchange for cash.[7]\n\nTohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles\n\n2005\u20132007: Injury Woes\n\nIwakuma was named the Eagles' starter for the 2005 season opener, holding the Chiba Lotte Marines to one run while going the distance on March 26 and earning the expansion team's first-ever win.[8] However, while he did not miss a single start during the regular season, he was bothered by tenderness in his shoulder throughout the year, finishing with a 9-15 record and an ERA of 4.99 (worst among all qualifying pitchers).[9]\n\nIwakuma's injury woes continued into the 2006 season. His struggles to adapt to the league's new rules on pitching motions during Spring training, combined with lingering concerns about his shoulder condition, caused him to miss the season opener and spend the entire first half of the season with the nigun team undergoing a rehab stint. He made his first appearance of the season against the Fighters on August 29, but did not record a win until September 12 in a game against the Marines, finishing the season with a 1\u20132 record and 3.72 ERA in just six starts.\n\nIn 2007, Iwakuma was named the starter for the season opener for the first time in two years, taking the mound on March 24 against the Lions. While he was slated to start the Eagles' first home game of the season on March 31 against the Buffaloes as well, he reported stiffness in his back just hours before the game, causing him to be scratched from the lineup and sent down to the minors for rehab the next day. He returned at the end of April only to be demoted again just weeks later with a left oblique strain. Iwakuma finally returned after the All-Star break, notching his second win of the season on July 31 and finishing the season with a 5\u20135 record in 16 games and an ERA of 3.40. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow in October.[10]\n\nIwakuma in 2008.\n\n2008 season\n\nChosen to start the season opener for the second straight year (and fourth time overall), Iwakuma pitched against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks on March 20, 2008, but fell short of the win despite limiting the Hawks to just one run over seven innings (then-closer Domingo Guzm\u00e1n gave up a walk-off home run to outfielder Hiroshi Shibahara, handing Iwakuma a no-decision in a 4\u20133 loss). However, he recorded his first complete game shutout with the Eagles in his next start on March 27 against the Buffaloes and recorded his 10th win of the season in another complete game shutout against the Yomiuri Giants in an interleague game on June 15, marking the first time he had reached double-digit wins since 2003, when he was still with the Buffaloes. Though he expressed disappointment that he was not chosen to play in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a member of the national team (even though he ranked among the league leaders in several categories at the time), he notched his 16th win of the season, a new career high, on August 16 against the Marines, passing 1000 career innings pitched in that same game.\n\nOn September 22, in a game against the Saitama Seibu Lions, Iwakuma threw seven innings of one-run ball to become the first 20-game winner in the Pacific League since Hawks right-hander Kazumi Saito achieved the feat in 2003.[11] He picked up one more win on October 5 against the Hawks, becoming the first 21-game winner in 23 years (former Hankyu Braves right-hander Yoshinori Satoh won 21 games in 1985) and passing young rival and fellow ace Yu Darvish of the Fighters to lead the league in ERA (1.87) in his final start of the season.\n\nIwakuma finished his dominant 2008 campaign with a 21\u20134 record, leading the league in wins, ERA, and winning percentage (.840).[12] He gave up just three home runs in 201 2\u20443 innings all year, of which just one was to a Pacific League hitter (the other two were given up in interleague games), and won nearly one-third of the Eagles' 65 wins in the regular season himself. He was presented the Sawamura, Most Valuable Player and Best Nine awards at the end of the season, a rare accomplishment for a player on a fifth-place team.[13]\n\n2009\u20132011\n\nIwakuma started the season opener for the Eagles for the third straight year in 2009, requiring just 59 pitches to throw six innings of one-run ball en route to the win on April 3 in a much-hyped match-up with World Baseball Classic teammate and 22-year-old Fighters right-hander Yu Darvish (who threw 121 pitches in a complete game loss, all three runs given up in the first inning).[14] He recorded his first complete game of the year on May 16 against the Hawks.[15]\n\nOn October 4, 2010, the Golden Eagles granted permission for Iwakuma to pursue a career in Major League Baseball via the posting system.[16] The Oakland Athletics won the bidding.[17] However, Iwakuma and the Athletics could not come to terms on a contract in the thirty-day negotiating period.[18]\n\nSeattle Mariners\n\nIwakuma signed with the Seattle Mariners prior to the 2012 Major League Baseball season, for $1.5 million guaranteed, plus an additional $3.4 million in incentives linked to starts, innings pitched, and awards.[19] He was part of the Mariners' bullpen to start the season and did not pitch until the club's fifteenth game, making him the last member of any team's opening day roster (who was not injured or demoted to the minor leagues) to appear in a game.[20] Iwakuma later became an effective member of the Mariners' pitching staff, pitching in 30 games (16 starts and 14 relief appearances), going 9\u20135 with two saves and a 3.16 earned run average.\n\nOn November 2, 2012, Iwakuma agreed to a two-year, $14 million extension with an option for 2015. Iwakuma earned $6.5 million in 2013 and 2014, and his option for 2015 is worth $7 million with a $1 million buyout.[21] Iwakuma was chosen along with fellow pitcher F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez to represent the Mariners at the 2013 MLB All-Star Game.[citation needed] However, he did not pitch, as he had played on the Sunday before the game. On September 18, 2013, Iwakuma pitched eight scoreless innings against the Detroit Tigers striking out Miguel Cabrera twice making him 0 for 4 and lowering his batting average to .347. He gave up no runs and four hits getting out of two bases loaded jams in the first and fourth.\n\nIwakuma finished third in the 2013 American League Cy Young Award voting, behind winner Max Scherzer and runner up Yu Darvish.[22] He finished the year third in the league in ERA, third in innings pitched, second in WHIP and first in WAR.[23] His 2013 season year finished 14\u20136 with a 2.66 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP.\n\nIwakuma sustained a strained tendon in his finger in February 2014 and was expected to miss 4\u20136 weeks.[24] On May 3, Iwakuma returned from the DL to play against the Houston Astros.[citation needed] Making 28 starts in 2014, Iwakuma finished 15\u20139 with a 3.52 ERA.\n\nOn April 21, 2015, Iwakuma was placed on the DL with a strained lat muscle. He was activated by Seattle on July 6.[25]\n\nOn August 12, 2015, at Safeco Field against the Baltimore Orioles, Iwakuma threw the fifth no-hitter in Mariners history. It was also his first MLB complete game.[1] For his effort, Iwakuma won the American League Player of the Week Award. Making 20 starts in 2015, Iwakuma finished with a 9\u20135 record and a 3.54 ERA.[citation needed]\n\nOn December 17, 2015, Iwakuma re-signed with the Mariners on a 1-year contract, with vesting options for 2017 and 2018.[26] Iwakuma had previously attempted to sign a three-year, $45 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the deal was declined because the Dodgers had some concerns about the results of his physical.[27]\n\nOn May 10, 2017, Iwakuma was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to right shoulder inflammation.[28] He was later moved to the 60-day disabled list. On November 2, 2017, the Seattle Mariners declined their option making him a free agent. He signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Mariners on November 27.[29] On September 11, 2018, he announced that he would return to Japan to play baseball after spending the entire season in the minors.[30]\n\nYomiuri Giants\n\nOn December 19, 2018, he signed with Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).[31]\n\nOn October 19, 2020, Iwakuma announced his retirement after the season.[32]\n\nInternational career\n\n2004 Athens Olympics\n\nIwakuma made his first appearance on the international stage when he was named to the Japanese national team that would play in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Coming off a torrid 12\u20130 start to the regular season, Iwakuma took the mound in the second game of the preliminary round against the Netherlands on August 16. However, he allowed seven baserunners (three hits, three walks, and a hit-batter) and gave up three runs (two earned) against a team that was viewed as the heavy underdog, leading head coach (and acting manager) Kiyoshi Nakahata to pull him from the game after just 1 2\u20443 innings.[33] Though Japan went on to win the game 8\u20133 behind a strong relief effort (five shutout innings) by future MLB pitcher Hiroki Kuroda, Iwakuma lost the trust of the coaching staff and did not pitch in the tournament again.\n\n2009 World Baseball Classic\n\nChosen to play in the 2009 World Baseball Classic as a member of the national team,[34] Iwakuma made his first appearance of the tournament in the final game of the first round against South Korea on March 9, holding them just one run over 5 1\u20443 innings but receiving no run support and being charged with the loss. He pitched six shutout innings in his second start against Cuba in the second round on March 18, earning his first win of the tournament.[35] His stellar effort convinced manager Tatsunori Hara to choose him over Darvish, who had been unofficially tabbed as the staff ace prior to the tournament, as the starter for Japan in the championship game against South Korea. Iwakuma did not disappoint, limiting the team to just two runs over 7 2\u20443 innings.[36] While Darvish gave up the tying run in the ninth after coming on in relief, Iwakuma played an instrumental role in Japan's eventual win and second consecutive title.[37] Boston Red Sox right-hander Daisuke Matsuzaka earned MVP honors for the tournament, largely on merit of his perfect 3\u20130 record, but Iwakuma finished the tournament with the lowest ERA (1.35) of any pitcher that threw 15 or more innings and was one of three pitchers named to the All-Tournament team.[38]\n\nPitching style\n\nMechanics\n\nIwakuma is a 6-foot-3-inch (1.91 m), 210-pound (95 kg), right-hander pitcher with a three-quarters delivery. He was well known for his unique pitching motion during his years with the Buffaloes, letting his throwing arm hang at his side while he raised his left leg, lowered it halfway once, then raised it again before driving towards the plate. He was forced to overhaul his mechanics and implement a more orthodox delivery when the NPB changed its rules on pitching motions in the 2005 off-season, taking a stricter stance on so-called two-stage motions (those with pauses or breaks at any point in the delivery).[39] In 2008, Iwakuma also raised his arm slot slightly to induce more movement in his offspeed pitches.\n\nRepertoire\n\nIwakuma's four-seam fastball was clocked at speeds as high as 153 km/h (95 mph) earlier in his NPB career. Since hurting his shoulder, it has usually sat in 88\u201392 mph (tops out at 94 mph). He complements it with an above-average splitter (84\u201387 mph), a slider (80\u201382 mph), an occasional curveball (71\u201373 mph), and a shuuto (two-seamer/sinker, 87\u201391 mph),[40][41] often using the splitter as his out pitch. He records a moderate number of strikeouts each season but is inherently a groundball pitcher, adept at jamming opposing hitters with his wide assortment of offspeed pitches and excellent command[42][43] (2.00 career walks per nine innings rate in NPB). Iwakuma has also remarked that his command has improved since missing much of the 2006 and 2007 seasons due to injury as he was forced to overhaul his mechanics and rethink his approach against opposing batters.[citation needed]\n\nCoaching career\n\nOn January 12, 2021, Iwakuma was hired by the Seattle Mariners, his former team, as a special assignment coach.[44]\n\nPersonal life\n\nIwakuma's wife, Madoka, and two children, Towa and Uta, moved with him from Japan to Seattle at the start of his Mariner career.[45] Iwakuma's wife is the daughter of Koju Hirohashi, former coach of the Seibu Lions.[46] Iwakuma practices Nichiren Buddhism and is a member of the Soka Gakkai International Buddhist association.[47] He and his wife support various children's charities including orphanages and organizations that provide assistance to children with disabilities.[46]\n\nReferences\n\nAchievements Preceded by Cole Hamels No-hitter pitcher\n\nAugust 12, 2015 Succeeded by Mike Fiers"}, {"url": "https://kids.kiddle.co/Hisashi_Iwakuma", "page_content": "Hisashi Iwakuma (\u5ca9\u9688 \u4e45\u5fd7, Iwakuma Hisashi, born April 12, 1981) is a Japanese former professional baseball pitcher.

He enjoyed a breakout year in 2003, going 15\u201310 with a 3.45 ERA and 149 strikeouts and leading the league with 11 complete games.\n\n2004\n\nIwakuma began the 2004 season 12\u20130 and establishing a franchise record for most consecutive wins to start the season. He received the most fan votes among Pacific League starting pitchers for the NPB All-Star Game that year, starting Game 1 at Nagoya Dome on July 10, and pitched in the 2004 Athens Olympics as a member of the Japanese national team in August. He finished with a 15\u20132 record for the year, leading the league in both wins and winning percentage (.882) for the first time in his career. He also pitched in Game 5 of the MLB All-Star Series held in November, holding the MLB All-Stars to one run over seven innings to earn the win.\n\nFollowing the 2004 season, Iwakuma's Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave, another Pacific League team based in the Kansai region, opted to merge to alleviate some of their financial difficulties, later leading to the addition of a new team named the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles that would fill the void created by the merger.

Although the Buffaloes attempted to persuade him to play for their team, they eventually agreed to trade him to the Eagles in exchange for cash.\n\nTohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles\n\n2005\u20132007: Injury Woes\n\nIwakuma was named the Eagles' starter for the 2005 season opener, holding the Chiba Lotte Marines to one run while going the distance on March 26 and earning the expansion team's first-ever win. However, while he did not miss a single start during the regular season, he was bothered by tenderness in his shoulder throughout the year, finishing with a 9-15 record and an ERA of 4.99 (worst among all qualifying pitchers).\n\nIwakuma's injury woes continued into the 2006 season. His struggles to adapt to the league's new rules on pitching motions during Spring training, combined with lingering concerns about his shoulder condition, caused him to miss the season opener and spend the entire first half of the season with the nigun team undergoing a rehab stint.

While he was slated to start the Eagles' first home game of the season on March 31 against the Buffaloes as well, he reported stiffness in his back just hours before the game, causing him to be scratched from the lineup and sent down to the minors for rehab the next day. He returned at the end of April only to be demoted again just weeks later with a left oblique strain. Iwakuma finally returned after the All-Star break, notching his second win of the season on July 31 and finishing the season with a 5\u20135 record in 16 games and an ERA of 3.40. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right elbow in October.\n\nIwakuma in 2008.\n\n2008 season\n\nChosen to start the season opener for the second straight year (and fourth time overall), Iwakuma pitched against the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks on March 20, 2008, but fell short of the win despite limiting the Hawks to just one run over seven innings (then-closer Domingo Guzm\u00e1n gave up a walk-off home run to outfielder Hiroshi Shibahara, handing Iwakuma a no-decision in a 4\u20133 loss). However, he recorded his first complete game shutout with the Eagles in his next start on March 27 against the Buffaloes and recorded his 10th win of the season in another complete game shutout against the Yomiuri Giants in an interleague game on June 15, marking the first time he had reached double-digit wins since 2003, when he was still with the Buffaloes. Though he expressed disappointment that he was not chosen to play in the 2008 Beijing Olympics as a member of the national team (even though he ranked among the league leaders in several categories at the time), he notched his 16th win of the season, a new career high, on August 16 against the Marines, passing 1000 career innings pitched in that same game.\n\nOn September 22, in a game against the Saitama Seibu Lions, Iwakuma threw seven innings of one-run ball to become the first 20-game winner in the Pacific League since Hawks right-hander Kazumi Saito achieved the feat in 2003. He picked up one more win on October 5 against the Hawks, becoming the first 21-game winner in 23 years (former Hankyu Braves right-hander Yoshinori Satoh won 21 games in 1985) and passing young rival and fellow ace Yu Darvish of the Fighters to lead the league in ERA (1.87) in his final start of the season.\n\nIwakuma finished his dominant 2008 campaign with a 21\u20134 record, leading the league in wins, ERA, and winning percentage (.840). He gave up just three home runs in 2012\u2044 3 innings all year, of which just one was to a Pacific League hitter (the other two were given up in interleague games), and won nearly one-third of the Eagles' 65 wins in the regular season himself. He was presented the Sawamura, Most Valuable Player and Best Nine awards at the end of the season, a rare accomplishment for a player on a fifth-place team.\n\n2009\u20132011\n\nIwakuma started the season opener for the Eagles for the third straight year in 2009, requiring just 59 pitches to throw six innings of one-run ball en route to the win on April 3 in a much-hyped match-up with World Baseball Classic teammate and 22-year-old Fighters right-hander Yu Darvish (who threw 121 pitches in a complete game loss, all three runs given up in the first inning). He recorded his first complete game of the year on May 16 against the Hawks.\n\nOn October 4, 2010, the Golden Eagles granted permission for Iwakuma to pursue a career in Major League Baseball via the posting system. The Oakland Athletics won the bidding. However, Iwakuma and the Athletics could not come to terms on a contract in the thirty-day negotiating period.\n\nSeattle Mariners\n\nIwakuma signed with the Seattle Mariners prior to the 2012 Major League Baseball season, for $1.5 million guaranteed, plus an additional $3.4 million in incentives linked to starts, innings pitched, and awards. He was part of the Mariners' bullpen to start the season and did not pitch until the club's fifteenth game, making him the last member of any team's opening day roster (who was not injured or demoted to the minor leagues) to appear in a game. Iwakuma later became an effective member of the Mariners' pitching staff, pitching in 30 games (16 starts and 14 relief appearances), going 9\u20135 with two saves and a 3.16 earned run average.\n\nOn November 2, 2012, Iwakuma agreed to a two-year, $14 million extension with an option for 2015. Iwakuma earned $6.5 million in 2013 and 2014, and his option for 2015 is worth $7 million with a $1 million buyout. Iwakuma was chosen along with fellow pitcher F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez to represent the Mariners at the 2013 MLB All-Star Game. However, he did not pitch, as he had played on the Sunday before the game. On September 18, 2013, Iwakuma pitched eight scoreless innings against the Detroit Tigers striking out Miguel Cabrera twice making him 0 for 4 and lowering his batting average to .347. He gave up no runs and four hits getting out of two bases loaded jams in the first and fourth.\n\nIwakuma finished third in the 2013 American League Cy Young Award voting, behind winner Max Scherzer and runner up Yu Darvish. He finished the year third in the league in ERA, third in innings pitched, second in WHIP and first in WAR. His 2013 season year finished 14\u20136 with a 2.66 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP.\n\nIwakuma sustained a strained tendon in his finger in February 2014 and was expected to miss 4\u20136 weeks. On May 3, Iwakuma returned from the DL to play against the Houston Astros. Making 28 starts in 2014, Iwakuma finished 15\u20139 with a 3.52 ERA.\n\nOn April 21, 2015, Iwakuma was placed on the DL with a strained lat muscle. He was activated by Seattle on July 6.\n\nOn August 12, 2015, at Safeco Field against the Baltimore Orioles, Iwakuma threw the fifth no-hitter in Mariners history. It was also his first MLB complete game. For his effort, Iwakuma won the American League Player of the Week Award. Making 20 starts in 2015, Iwakuma finished with a 9\u20135 record and a 3.54 ERA.\n\nOn December 17, 2015, Iwakuma re-signed with the Mariners on a 1-year contract, with vesting options for 2017 and 2018. Iwakuma had previously attempted to sign a three-year, $45 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but the deal was declined because the Dodgers had some concerns about the results of his physical.\n\nOn May 10, 2017, Iwakuma was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to right shoulder inflammation. He was later moved to the 60-day disabled list. On November 2, 2017, the Seattle Mariners declined their option making him a free agent. He signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Mariners on November 27. On September 11, 2018, he announced that he would return to Japan to play baseball after spending the entire season in the minors.\n\nYomiuri Giants\n\nOn December 19, 2018, he signed with Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).\n\nOn October 19, 2020, Iwakuma announced his retirement after the season.\n\nInternational career\n\n2004 Athens Olympics\n\nIwakuma made his first appearance on the international stage when he was named to the Japanese national team that would play in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Coming off a torrid 12\u20130 start to the regular season, Iwakuma took the mound in the second game of the preliminary round against the Netherlands on August 16. However, he allowed seven baserunners (three hits, three walks, and a hit-batter) and gave up three runs (two earned) against a team that was viewed as the heavy underdog, leading head coach (and acting manager) Kiyoshi Nakahata to pull him from the game after just 12\u2044 3 innings. Though Japan went on to win the game 8\u20133 behind a strong relief effort (five shutout innings) by future MLB pitcher Hiroki Kuroda, Iwakuma lost the trust of the coaching staff and did not pitch in the tournament again.\n\n2009 World Baseball Classic\n\nChosen to play in the 2009 World Baseball Classic as a member of the national team, Iwakuma made his first appearance of the tournament in the final game of the first round against South Korea on March 9, holding them just one run over 51\u2044 3 innings but receiving no run support and being charged with the loss. He pitched six shutout innings in his second start against Cuba in the second round on March 18, earning his first win of the tournament. His stellar effort convinced manager Tatsunori Hara to choose him over Darvish, who had been unofficially tabbed as the staff ace prior to the tournament, as the starter for Japan in the championship game against South Korea. Iwakuma did not disappoint, limiting the team to just two runs over 72\u2044 3 innings. While Darvish gave up the tying run in the ninth after coming on in relief, Iwakuma played an instrumental role in Japan's eventual win and second consecutive title. Boston Red Sox right-hander Daisuke Matsuzaka earned MVP honors for the tournament, largely on merit of his perfect 3\u20130 record, but Iwakuma finished the tournament with the lowest ERA (1.35) of any pitcher that threw 15 or more innings and was one of three pitchers named to the All-Tournament team.\n\nPitching style\n\nMechanics\n\nIwakuma is a 6-foot-3-inch (1.91 m), 210-pound (95 kg), right-hander pitcher with a three-quarters delivery. He was well known for his unique pitching motion during his years with the Buffaloes, letting his throwing arm hang at his side while he raised his left leg, lowered it halfway once, then raised it again before driving towards the plate. He was forced to overhaul his mechanics and implement a more orthodox delivery when the NPB changed its rules on pitching motions in the 2005 off-season, taking a stricter stance on so-called two-stage motions (those with pauses or breaks at any point in the delivery). In 2008, Iwakuma also raised his arm slot slightly to induce more movement in his offspeed pitches.\n\nRepertoire\n\nIwakuma's four-seam fastball was clocked at speeds as high as 153 km/h (95 mph) earlier in his NPB career. Since hurting his shoulder, it has usually sat in 88\u201392 mph (tops out at 94 mph). He complements it with an above-average splitter (84\u201387 mph), a slider (80\u201382 mph), an occasional curveball (71\u201373 mph), and a shuuto (two-seamer/sinker, 87\u201391 mph), often using the splitter as his out pitch. He records a moderate number of strikeouts each season but is inherently a groundball pitcher, adept at jamming opposing hitters with his wide assortment of offspeed pitches and excellent command (2.00 career walks per nine innings rate in NPB). Iwakuma has also remarked that his command has improved since missing much of the 2006 and 2007 seasons due to injury as he was forced to overhaul his mechanics and rethink his approach against opposing batters.\n\nCoaching career\n\nOn January 12, 2021, Iwakuma was hired by the Seattle Mariners, his former team, as a special assignment coach.\n\nPersonal life\n\nIwakuma's wife, Madoka, and two children, Towa and Uta, moved with him from Japan to Seattle at the start of his Mariner career. Iwakuma's wife is the daughter of Koju Hirohashi, former coach of the Seibu Lions. Iwakuma practices Nichiren Buddhism and is a member of the Soka Gakkai International Buddhist association. He and his wife support various children's charities including orphanages and organizations that provide assistance to children with disabilities."}, {"url": "https://napost.com/2018/interview-with-hisashi-iwakuma-former-seattle-mariners-pitcher/", "page_content": "Thanks for Seven Great Years, Kuma!\n\nAt the baseball game at Safeco Field against the Oakland A\u2019s on September 26, Hisashi Iwakuma, the righhanded pitcher who had such a brilliant career with the Seattle Mariners, threw out the first pitch. It was a nice gesture by the Mariners front office to send the pitcher out in style. It was also an unusual outing for the surprised pitcher, who thought to himself, \u201cBut I\u2019m not retiring.\u201d The gesture showed just how beloved he is by his teammates and the fans. That\u2019s the sort of guy Hisashi Iwakuma is.\n\nInterview by Noriko Huntsinger, Translated by Bruce Rutledge\n\n\u201cI owe my baseball life to the fans and my family.\u201d\n\nDetermined to remain active\n\nOur interview was arranged hastily on September 10, the day before Hisashi Iwakuma was set to announce his resignation from the team. We met at his home in a quiet residential section of Bellevue. The soft-spoken athlete listened quietly to my questions and answered little by little. He appeared to be an honest and serious person. How much was his mind occupied by the following day\u2019s announcement? I didn\u2019t detect any sense of sadness or despair. On the contrary, he gave off a relaxed, refreshing air. His minor league games were all finished for the season. His chances of returning to the Major Leagues were slim. When I asked him about his future course, he broke out in a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t even know,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I get an offer, I\u2019ll go anywhere. I\u2019m up for the challenge.\u201d\n\nHe spoke with the strong intentions of an active baseball player. If he retired, there would probably be a place for him as an executive or staff member in the Mariners organization , but that wasn\u2019t the path he wanted. He is obsessed with remaining a player. His wife, Madoka, offered this: \u201cHe was injured, had surgery, and then, out of nowhere, he was ready for battle again. We were so happy! After his first game back, the family was thrilled.\u201d\n\nIwakuma injured his right shoulder and was put on the disabled list for most of the 2017 season. In September of that same year, he had surgery on his shoulder and signed with the Mariners to start the 2018 season. He was aiming to get back in the Majors. On August 31, he pitched two scoreless innings for the Single-A Everett Aquasox against the Vancouver Canadians, a Toronto Blue Jays minor league franchise. On his next trip to the mound on August 26, he had a feel for his pitches again.\n\n\u201cI owe my baseball life to the fans and my family. I want to continue to return the favor through baseball,\u201d he said.\n\nHalf a lifetime with baseball\n\nIwakuma started baseball when he was a first grader. He watched professional baseball on TV and decided it was for him. \u201cI thought the uniforms and the way they played was so cool. I was saying it was my dream to become a professional baseball player since kindergarten.\u201d His father\u2019s understanding of the game as a sandlotter helped too. Iwakuma soon joined the local little league team. His older brother started playing with him a little later, and soon he was playing every day, either in little league or with friends at the park. \u201cToday, it may be soccer, but back then, everybody played baseball,\u201d he recalled.\n\nHe steeped himself in baseball, continued to play and never lost his love of the game. \u201cI tried every position, and they were all fun. But the pitcher was the coolest,\u201d he said. In third grade, he started playing in games with the older students. He remembers thinking at the time that \u201cI can become a professional player.\u201d But he says with humility that he was lucky to become a pro. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was far ahead of the other players,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were lots of great young players around.\u201d\n\nIn his junior year at Horikoshi High School, he was the winning pitcher in the spring tournament and he caught the attention of a scout who was there to watch the other team. This was his link to the pros. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get into Koshien, the media completely ignores you,\u201d he says, referring to the annual Koshien high school baseball tournament. \u201cIt takes luck to get to the pros.\u201d He was drafted fifth by the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes and was told the next three years would provide his training. \u201cFirst, it was physical strengthening. I didn\u2019t appear in a game my first year.\u201d So the baseball-loving Iwakuma steadily built his strength. As a result, his technique improved. He moved from the second team to the pros and gained the confidence it would take to win. In his second year, he joined the first team. How did he motivate himself during that time when his future was unknown and he was doing strength training? \u201cMy dream of becoming a pro had come true. All that was left was to improve my strength and technique and advance to the first team. I believed that if I did this, there would be a place for me among the veteran players,\u201d he said.\n\nEvents that changed his outlook on life\n\nMergers and restructuring in Japanese baseball in 2004 had their effects on Iwakuma. The Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes became the Orix Buffaloes. On top of that, he was traded to the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. \u201cStarting from scratch is tough. Early spring in Sendai is cold,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut once you live there awhile, you realize how nice it is. The fans were great. We lost a lot of games at first, but the fans never wavered in their support.\u201d After playing with the restructured Orix Buffaloes, he brought a fresh attitude to the 2005 season with the Golden Eagles. \u201cI experienced a lot of growth as a baseball player and as a person,\u201d Iwakuma recalled.\n\nDuring the three years he played for Rakuten, he was plagued with injuries. \u201cUp to that point, I just was playing the game I loved. But when I couldn\u2019t pitch, I had to face some dark thoughts for the first time. But the fans were always there for me. From the bottom of my heart, I want to show my gratitude to them for being able to play baseball, which has revived me and helped me grow.\u201d This is also the time when the seeds were planted for another move: \u201cI wanted to see if I could make it in the Major Leagues.\u201d\n\nWhen Japan won the 2009 World Baseball Classic, Iwakuma went up against the best baseball players in the world. His ambition had become a reality. \u201cI wanted to experience first hand how their baseball was different from Japanese baseball,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThen we experienced the earthquake in Sendai, which made the opportunity to go to the US more of a reality. If I succeeded in the Majors, I thought I could bring support and energy to the people of Tohoku.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, he signed a one-year contract with the Mariners, and the Iwakuma family moved to Seattle. \u201cWhen it was decided that I was joining Ichiro on the Mariners, I was very happy,\u201d he said. What was his impression of Seattle before he arrived? \u201cIt was the town where Ichiro lived,\u201d he replied. When he arrived, he liked the climate and felt right at home because the city had a similar vibe to Sendai. And what was it like to play here? \u201cJapanese baseball and American baseball are completely different,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst, the power is different. And the speed. Even the players\u2019 stature and strength are different. Also, individual results are everything in the Majors. If you don\u2019t produce, you\u2019ll quickly be fired. Japan isn\u2019t quite like that.\u201d\n\nOne of his teammates, Felix Hernandez, became a good friend. The King and Kuma led a dominating starting rotation that is still fresh in our minds.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Japanophile. He told me he likes Japan and sushi,\u201d said Iwakuma of The King. There are more Japanese players in the Major Leagues these days, so during spring training in Arizona, he\u2019d get together with Yu Darvish, Kenta Maeda and others for dinner. There were some tough times during his seven years in the Majors because of injuries, but all in all, he enjoyed getting to know other players from around the world.\n\nHis wife, Madoka, said that \u201cMariners players would often send text messages to him. When he lost a game in 2016 that could have helped them get to the playoffs, he received texts in Japanese that said \u2018Kuma, genkidashite\u2019 (Kuma, don\u2019t feel bad) and \u2018Kuma, nakanai de\u2019 (Kuma, don\u2019t cry). It was inspiring. In 2015, when he was re-signed by the Seattle Mariners, and not the Los Angeles Dodgers, we were very happy.\u201d She added that\n\nwhenever Iwakuma came back to Safeco Field from a rehab stint in the minors, his teammates would all welcome him back, shouting \u201cOkaeri, Kuma!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll I have is good memories of Seattle,\u201d Iwakuma said. His teammates and fans sent him farewells and thank yous via social media and in other ways, cementing the good feelings he has for the city.\n\nContinuing to contribute to Japanese society\n\nDuring the off-season, he returns home or spends time in Sendai, where Madoka\u2019s family lives. Since his time with Rakuten, he has visited the area often, going to the disaster area around the coast of Iwate Prefecture to offer support. \u201cAll in all, how many hours have I spent there? I always spend a long time there. I visit every year. I see the roads getting repaired, the city getting cleaned up. Step by step, they are making progress. Though their wounds aren\u2019t healed, I try to bring a little cheer when I visit.\u201d People in\n\ntemporary housing really light up when he visits, he says. Offering support gives him power, he says, and positively affects his playing. He offers support to the earthquake orphans and to the affected areas of Kumamoto. He gets the kids to smile when he holds baseball classes in those places, he says.\n\nIwakuma opened a sports training facility called IWA Academy in March 2016 to offer another way to support Japan. He is the co-owner and supervisor of the staff of about 15. \u201cI thought it might be a good way to contribute to society by offering a comfortable place for kids, senior citizens engaged in rehabilitation, and men and women of all ages to get professional training and treatment. It\u2019s not just baseball; we teach a lot of different sports techniques. We have a really excellent staff and it feels like everyone is part of one big family,\u201d Iwakuma said. The word is that children who get trained here see results when they return to their local teams. The school is full, but they still get lots of requests to learn the school\u2019s methods.\n\nIn the same year, Iwakuma started an anti-bullying program called Be a Hero. In the off-season, he toured Japan giving lectures on how bullying can be eliminated through science and about how to stop bullying outside of the school such as child abuse in the home and abuse of authority in sports. \u201cA child\u2019s potential can change based on a teacher or a way of teaching. When engaging in sports, it\u2019s necessary to offer appropriate education for a child\u2019s personal development,\u201d he said. \u201cThe old way of dragging spiritualism into extracurricular activities should change too.\u201d\n\nThe local newspaper and media tout Iwakuma\u2019s achievements. When we talk about that, the reticent Iwakuma breaks into a big smile. Where will we see him next? When he threw out the first pitch on September 26, Special Assistant to the Chairman Ichiro surprised him by being the catcher. The big screen played highlights from his 2015 no-hitter. Fans who rushed to the stadium to see Iwakuma throw his last pitch broke out in applause. \u201cI feel very grateful,\u201d the pitcher said. And that\u2019s how we Mariners fans feel too.\n\n\u201cI want to show my gratitude to them for being able to play baseball, which has revived me and helped me grow.\u201d\n\nHisashi Iwakuma\n\nBorn April 12, 1981, Iwakuma grew up in Tokyo. After graduating from Horikoshi High School, he played for the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes, the Orix Buffaloes, the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, and then the Seattle Mariners. In Japan, he\u2019s won many honors and was the driving force behind Japan\u2019s 2009 World Baseball Classic championship. He joined the Seattle Mariners in 2012. In August 2015, he became the second Japanese pitcher to throw a no-hitter in the Major Leagues. In 2016, he became supervisor of the IWA Academy in Tokyo, which helps everyone from children to adults train and learn about being athletes."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/hisashi-iwakuma", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nHisashi Iwakuma was born on 12 April, 1981 in Higashiyamato, Tokyo, Japan, is a Japanese baseball player.

The announcement was made earlier today on MLB Network.\n\nIwakuma threw the fifth no-hitter (fourth individual) in Mariners history en route to his first career AL weekly honor, the first for a Seattle pitcher since his teammate Felix Hernandez won on June 8, 2014. In a week with multiple worthy candidates, Baltimore Orioles teammates Adam Jones and Chris Davis were particularly notable, leading the O's to a 5-2 record this past week. Together, the slugging duo batted .420 (21-for-50) with 15 runs scored, 10 home runs and 19 RBI.\n\nOn Wednesday against the Orioles at Safeco Field, Hisashi, a Tokyo native, became the second Japanese-born pitcher in MLB history to record a no-hitter, joining Hideo Nomo, who accomplished the feat first with the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 17, 1996 against the Colorado Rockies and again with the Boston Red Sox on April 4, 2001 against Baltimore. Iwakuma, a 2013 AL All-Star became the first AL pitcher to toss a no-hitter since his teammate Hernandez spun a perfect game on August 15, 2012. There were 12 no-hitters (11 individual, one combined) in the National League since then, marking the longest streak of no-hitters thrown in one league since the inception of the AL in 1901. Each of the last three no-hitters in the AL have been tossed by the Mariners, with six pitchers combining to blank the Dodgers on June 8, 2012, preceding Hernandez's perfect game. Prior to Seattle, the last team responsible for three consecutive no-hitters in its league was the New York Yankees, who produced three straight no-hitters from 1996-99 (Dwight Gooden vs. Seattle on May 14, 1996; David Wells vs. Minnesota Twins on May 17, 1998; and David Cone vs. Montreal Expos on July 18, 1999). At the age of 34 years and 122 days, Iwakuma became the oldest AL pitcher to throw his first no-hitter since Cone threw his perfect game at 36 years old. Additionally, the crafty righthander became the oldest pitcher to throw a no-hitter since Hall of Famer Randy Johnson did so on May 18, 2004 against the Atlanta Braves (age 40). It was the 23rd no-hitter in MLB history by a pitcher 34-years-or-older. The no-hitter was the first complete game (88th career start) of the fourth-year Major Leaguer's career. Since 1914, Iwakuma is the 17th pitcher to throw a no-hitter in his first career complete game, and the first since Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox pitched a perfect game vs. Seattle on April 21, 2012 in his first complete game effort.\n\nOther noteworthy performances last week included the aforementioned Davis (.440, 7 R, 5 HR, 9 RBI) and Jones (.400, 8 R, 5 HR, 10 RBI) of the Orioles; Chris Sale (2-0, 1.26 ERA, 14.1 IP, 22 SO) of the Chicago White Sox; Johnny Cueto (2-0, 0.53 ERA, 1 CG, 1 SHO) and Eric Hosmer (.370, 8 R, 3 2B, 10 RBI) of the Kansas City Royals; and David Ortiz (.556, 6 R, 8 RBI, 1.000 SLG) of the Red Sox.\n\nIn recognition of his American League Player of the Week Award, Hisashi Iwakuma will be awarded a watch courtesy of Game Time, the leader in licensed sports watches, available at MLB.com."}, {"url": "https://www.mlb.com/mariners/news/hisashi-iwakuma-to-play-in-mlb-japan-all-star-series/c-100218370", "page_content": "Seattle Mariners right-handed starting pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma has been selected to play in the MLB-Japan All-Star Series in November.

And again, he can reach up to an additional $2.5 million in each of those seasons based on innings reached from 150 to 190.\n\nIwakuma rejected Seattle's one-year, $15.8 million qualifying offer in October and then agreed to a deal with the Dodgers on Dec. 6, but Jiji Press in Japan reported Thursday that the Dodgers never finalized that contract after Iwakuma failed a physical exam.\n\nTweet from @Mariners: Jerry Dipoto delivers a special gift to the front office at the #Mariners holiday party: Kuma is back. pic.twitter.com/8Bo8Y93ub2\n\n\"We said from the start that Kuma was a priority for us,\" new Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto said. \"Obviously, the developments from the last few days allowed us to get back in the game.

We're all thrilled. This is a big move for us. We feel like this really puts a finishing touch on what we think has been a very productive offseason.\"\n\nIwakuma pitched for the Mariners the past four years and passed their exit physical at the end of last season, then was listed by Dipoto as his top priority this offseason. But Dipoto declined to offer more than two years at $30 million earlier this month, and Iwakuma agreed instead to the Dodgers' deal.\n\nHe will now return to the team that signed him initially out of Japan in 2012 on a one-year, $1.5 million deal and paid him $7 million last season in the final year of his second contract with the club.\n\nA source told MLB.com that the Dodgers hadn't closed the door on signing Iwakuma, under a reworked contract, but he instead opted quickly to return to the Mariners.\n\nDipoto moved quickly to acquire left-hander Wade Miley in a trade with the Red Sox the day after Iwakuma agreed to the Dodgers' deal and now has additional rotation depth. Seattle's rotation will now have Felix Hernandez, Miley, Taijuan Walker, Nathan Karns, James Paxton and Iwakuma battling for five spots, with Vidal Nuno available as a swingman and Mike Montgomery offering further depth.\n\nIwakuma posted a 9-5 record and 3.54 ERA in 20 starts last season. He missed 10 weeks with a strained lat muscle behind his right shoulder, but returned in early July and went 9-4 with a 3.10 ERA over his final 17 games, including a no-hitter against the Orioles on Aug. 12.\n\nVideo: [email protected]: Iwakuma pitches a no-hitter vs. Orioles\n\nThe 6-foot-3 right-hander has been a solid No. 2 starter behind Hernandez for the past four years, going 47-25 with a 3.17 ERA in 111 games.\n\nDipoto has been busy this offseason since replacing Jack Zduriencik, making nine trades, signing four new free agents and now bringing back two of the team's own free agents in outfielder Franklin Gutierrez and Iwakuma. The only unsigned free agent from last season's Mariners club is veteran left-handed reliever Joe Beimel.\n\nFantasy spin | Fred Zinkie (@FredZinkieMLB)\n\nThough he missed 11 weeks with a right lat injury and had a 5.22 ERA entering the All-Star break last season, Iwakuma reaffirmed his status as a reliable mixed-league starter in the second half (3.05 ERA). While Los Angeles would have provided a fine landing spot for the right-hander in terms of fantasy production, his final decision to remain in Seattle is also a desirable outcome. Iwakuma owns stellar lifetime marks (3.17 ERA, 1.08 WHIP) across four seasons with the Mariners, and mixed-league owners should expect him to be a viable No. 3 starter in 2016. Of course, the 34-year-old must prove he can avoid the disabled list following back-to-back sub-30-start seasons.\n\nIwakuma's return to Seattle will create a rotation logjam that should catch the attention of fantasy owners. Nathan Karns, Taijuan Walker and James Paxton would each have mixed-league value if in possession of a rotation spot, but one of those three hurlers will likely begin the season in the bullpen or Triple-A if all six of Seattle's rotation hopefuls remain healthy."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/14392826/hisashi-iwakuma-returns-seattle-mariners", "page_content": "SEATTLE -- The Seattle Mariners have re-signed right-hander Hisashi Iwakuma after an agreement between Iwakuma and the Los Angeles Dodgers was never finalized.\n\nSeattle announced the deal with Iwakuma late Thursday night, after general manager Jerry Dipoto delivered the news at the team's holiday party.

He has pitched his entire career in the majors with Seattle, going 47-25 with a 3.17 ERA in 111 appearances.\n\n\"The Mariners stayed connected with me from the very beginning to the very end, and that helped me a lot,\" Iwakuma said.\n\nIwakuma gets a $1 million signing bonus payable through December 2017 and a $10 million salary this year.\n\nSeattle has $10 million options for 2017 and 2018, and Iwakuma would get a $1 million buyout if either option is declined. The 2017 option would become guaranteed at $14 million if he pitches 162 innings next year, and the 2018 option would become guaranteed at $15 million if he pitches 162 innings in 2017 or 324 combined in 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn each season, he can earn $500,000 for 150 innings pitched and each additional 10 through 190. He received a full no-trade provision, eight business class plane tickets annually between Japan and the U.S, an interpreter and a trainer with a $100,000 salary."}]}
