It was also shorter than the musket, but had a similar overall reach when fixed with its longer sword bayonet.\n\nThe new corps was made up of volunteers from existing line infantry regiments and was led by Coote Manningham and William Stewart. An early adopter of camouflage, its troops wore green jackets instead of redcoats. They were also taught to operate in pairs on their own initiative rather than in line formation under strict orders."}, {"url": "https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F128721", "page_content": "This website uses cookies\n\nWe place some essential cookies on your device to make this website work.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to use additional cookies to remember your settings and understand how you use our services.\n\n\n\nThis information will help us make improvements to the website."}, {"url": "https://www.angloboerwar.com/unit-information/imperial-units/644-rifle-brigade", "page_content": "Imperial units\n\nRifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own)\n\nPage 1 of 2\n\n1st Battalion\n\nThe 1st Battalion sailed on the German on 28th October 1899, arrived at the Cape on 20th November, and was sent on to Durban. Along with the 2nd Scottish Rifles, 3rd King's Royal Rifles, and 1st Durham Light Infantry, they formed the 4th Brigade under Major General Honourable N G Lyttelton. The work of the brigade is sketched under the 2nd Scottish Rifles, and of the Natal relief army generally under the 2nd Queen's.\n\nThe losses of the 1st Rifle Brigade at Colenso were trifling. At Vaal Krantz on 5th and 6th February their casualties were 5 men killed and 5 officers and 76 men wounded. For that engagement 4 officers and 4 non-commissioned officers and men were mentioned in General Buller's despatch of 8th February 1900.\n\nThe battalion took part in the heavy work between 13th and 27th February, and won the commendation of General Buller. In his telegram of 20th February the general mentioned 3 infantry battalions, one of which was the 1st Rifle Brigade.\n\nOn 18th February there fell to the Durham Light Infantry and 1st Rifle Brigade the task of attacking the nek between Greenhill and Monte Cristo. They wasted no time, and were soon in the laager behind the nek. On the 23rd these two battalions crossed the river, and in the forenoon received orders to support Hart's attack on Inniskilling Hill, but the attack was over before they arrived at the hill-foot. During the next four days, except on the 25th, the battalion was constantly fighting, being the leading battalion on the left of the line in the final assault on the 27th. In the fourteen days' fighting the Rifle Brigade's losses, including those of officers and men in the Composite Rifle Battalion, were approximately 14 men killed, 8 officers and 117 men wounded.\n\nFive officers and 10 non-commissioned officers and men were mentioned in General Buller's despatch of 30th March 1900, 3 of the latter being awarded the distinguished conduct medal, another man of the Mounted Infantry company getting that medal at Alleman's Nek. Captain H N Congreve brought a VC to the regiment, if not to the 1st Battalion, by his conspicuous gallantry in assisting to rescue the guns at Colenso on 15th December 1899.\n\nThe 4th Brigade took part in the turning movement via Helpmakaar in the first half of May 1900, and while the 2nd, 10th, and 11th Brigades turned the Laing's Nek position via Botha's Pass, the 4th sat in front of it. After Alleman's Nek, 11th June, the 4th Brigade was sent along the Pretoria Railway. On 28th July Major General Cooper with the Rifle Brigade and 3rd King's Royal Rifles took over Heidelberg from Hart. About that town the 1st Rifle Brigade was stationed for a long period.\n\nOn 9th October 1900 a disastrous incident occurred. The railway had been cut south of Heidelberg, and the same day Captain Paget, 2 other officers, a colour sergeant, and 14 riflemen went down the line on an engine to reconnoitre. 200 Boers were lying in wait, and had the little party completely at their mercy. Two officers and 1 man were killed, the others were wounded.\n\nIn General Buller's despatch of 9th November 1900 4 officers and 4 non-commissioned officers and men of the 1st Battalion were mentioned, and several officers of the regiment were also mentioned for good staff work. Twenty officers and 38 non-commissioned officers and men were mentioned in Lord Roberts' final despatch. These commendations embraced both 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n\nOn 26th December 1900 a part of the battalion had very severe fighting near the Oceana Mine, the company guarding the baggage being attacked while the others were out clearing farms. That day 10 men were killed and 2 officers and 40 men wounded.\n\nThroughout 1901 the battalion was generally in the neighbourhood of the Transvaal - Natal Railway. In January and February a lot of marching was done, sometimes with a column, sometimes taking convoys to Ermelo and other places for other columns. After February they were chiefly engaged in watching the railway, having latterly about forty miles in safe keeping.\n\nIn Lord Kitchener's despatches during the war 8 officers and 7 non-commissioned officers and men of the Rifle Brigade were mentioned, but in the case of some of these the battalion is not stated. In the final despatch 14 officers and 14 non-commissioned officers and men were mentioned.\n\nThe Rifle Brigade furnished many sections of Mounted Infantry, to follow whose doings would require a volume, as they had fighting all over the country. For a great part of 1901 one company did excellent work under Major M'Micking and Colonel Greenfell in the Nylstroom - Zand River Poort district, when substantial successes were scored. A party was with Major Gough when he had his disaster on the Blood River, 17th September 1901. On that occasion Lieutenant Blewitt and 1 rifleman were killed and 4 men wounded. The party did well, and an officer and man gained mention. Some of the Rifle Brigade were in the 13th Battalion Mounted Infantry and some in the 14th, both of which did splendid work under Bullock, Spens, and other commanders, chiefly in the Eastern Transvaal and the north-east of the Orange River Colony. A good idea of the services of these two battalions is to be had from Lieutenant Moeller's 'Two Years at the Front.'\n\n2nd Battalion\n\nThe 2nd Battalion sailed from Crete on the Jelunga on 2nd October 1899, and reached Durban on the 26th. At 3 am on the 30th the battalion got into Ladysmith by rail, and after a hasty meal set out to join the 1st Devon, 1st Manchester, and 2nd Gordons under Ian Hamilton at Limit Hill, north of the town, where Sir George's centre was that day (see 1st Liverpool). The brigade did not have much to do beyond sending help to Colonel Grimwood's brigade on the right or east. During the forenoon the battalion and the 2nd Gordons deployed and lined the crest of Limit Hill, from which they covered the retreat of Grimwood's brigade, they themselves eventually retiring about 3 pm.\n\nFrom the commencement of the siege the battalion held King's Post and Leicester Post on the north of the town, and, unlike some other battalions, they strained every nerve for weeks to make these posts absolutely unassailable. The rocky nature of the ground, the want of suitable tools, and the fact that many of the diggers had to be on duty in the trenches all night, made the task superlatively difficult Observation Post, about a mile in advance of King's Post, was till 9th November held by a weak detachment of the 5th Lancers, who were attacked on that day, and the Rifle Brigade had to reinforce them. The attack was repulsed. The battalion's losses were 1 officer and 1 man mortally wounded and 4 men wounded. They had now to garrison this post and to set about making it impregnable. One very remarkable piece of work done by the battalion was the keeping down by the Lee-Metford fire of 'sharpshooters, many of whom were officers', of the Boer artillery-fire at ranges between 2000 and 2800 yards. On the morning of 8th December it became known that General Hunter with 600 men of the Imperial Light Horse and Natal Carabiniers had blown up two big guns on Lombard's Kop and captured a maxim. This fired Colonel Metcalfe to do something similar, and he got Sir George's sanction to endeavour to destroy the howitzer on Surprise Hill. On the night of the 9th he reconnoitred the route, and on the 10th at 10 pm started with five companies 2nd Rifle Brigade and a few Engineers under the ever-ready Lieutenant Digby-Jones. The hill-top was reached; after some delay the howitzer was found, not in its emplacement; the explosive was inserted; a fuse was lit, but no explosion happened; another had to be set. This time the gun was destroyed; but meanwhile the Boers had gathered in force on the hillside, and our men had to charge with fixed bayonets, never firing a shot. Many Boers were bayoneted. Colonel Metcalfe lost 1 officer and 11 men killed, 36 wounded, and 10 prisoners or missing, but a bit of good work had been boldly and skilfully executed. Sir George White in his despatch of 23rd March 1900 remarks that \"the companies were, on the way back, admirably handled by their captains ... The affair reflects great credit on Lieutenant Colonel C T E Metcalfe and his battalion\".\n\nAt three on the morning of 6th January the battalion heard the furious rattle of musketry round the southern defences, and about 5.30 they were ordered to send six companies to Caesar's Camp, four miles off, arriving there about seven. Five companies were pushed into the firing line, which was distant from the enemy only 80 yards. \"For nearly the whole day the fight raged fiercely, first one side then the other gaining a slight advantage, but we could not succeed in dislodging the Boers\" from the south-east of the hill. At 3.30 the enemy tried to rush forward, but were driven back, and shortly afterwards retreated under a heavy fire, \"some companies firing their last round\". The battalion this day lost 1 officer killed and 1 mortally wounded, and 20 men killed, 5 officers and 32 men wounded. That night officers and men lay on the stricken field soaked and physically wretched, but knowing that another big bit of work had been done. Five officers and 8 non-commissioned officers and men were mentioned in Sir George White's despatch of 23rd March 1900.\n\nOn 7th January the battalion was ordered to take over Waggon Hill from the 1st King's Royal Rifles. The Honourable A Dawnay, adjutant of the 2nd battalion, in the account which he gives of the siege, already quoted from, says: \"On arriving at Waggon Hill we were not best pleased at our change of quarters; we found none of those snug burrows or palatial residences that we had built with so much care in our old habitation, and the defensive works were few and far between. All the weary digging had to be started afresh, only under more trying conditions, as it all had to be done by night, it being quite impossible to attempt anything of the sort by day, since we were continually exposed to shrapnel at the convenient range of 3200 yards. Quite two miles of front had to be fortified, but in a very short time a complete set of works made their appearance, continuous sangars occupied a large portion of our front, wire entanglements were laid down all round the front of our position, and abattis made in places\".\n\nPerhaps the King's Royal Rifles thought that they did all the digging desirable, but various writers support the statements contained in the quotation. General Ian Hamilton has almost a faultless record in the campaign. He added to his reputation on the 6th January, but it does seem almost a fault that he allowed the battalions occupying Waggon Hill and Caesar's Camp to sit there without working at their defences as their brethren on the north side of Ladysmith were doing.\n\nAfter the relief of Ladysmith the garrison was given a period to rest and recuperate, and never did men deserve that more. They were ready to go forward when General Buller moved north, and the 2nd Rifle Brigade were brigaded under General Walter Kitchener with the 1st Devon, 1st Manchester, and 2nd Gordons. In the fighting at Rooi Kopjes, 24th July, and Amersfoort, 7th August, the battalion took no prominent part, but they were to get a great opportunity in good time. When the force arrived at Geluk, 23rd August, it was evident the Boers were about to make a stand. On the 26th, at a conference between Lord Roberts and General Buller, it was arranged that the troops of the latter, being the old Ladysmith garrison, should attack the enemy's position on the 27th.\n\nThe position was an extremely strong one, stretching for miles on either side of the Belfast-Koomati Poort Railway. Bergendal, by which name the battle has become known, is the name of a farm, the house and buildings of which are situated on, or rather a little to the east of, a kopje. This kopje and the buildings, which were seen to be strongly held, lie to the south of the railway and to the west of a long ridge or series of kopjes running roughly north and south. These ridges seem to have been the Boer main position. They had guns on these as well as on the hills north of the railway. Sir Redvers decided that Bergendal kopje must be the first point attacked. It was slightly isolated, and formed a definite objective. He placed the Manchester Regiment, four naval 12-pounders, two 4'7 guns, two 5-inch guns, the 61st Howitzer Battery, and the 21st Battery on a ridge lying south of, and roughly parallel to, a line drawn from Bergendal to the Boer main positions. The 42nd Battery was farther to the right of the Manchesters. A Battery RHA and the 53rd RFA fired from a point about one and a half mile north of the other artillery and close to the railway. For three hours these guns kept up a furious fire on the buildings and kopje, but the Boers would not shift. The infantry were then ordered to assault, the 2nd Rifle Brigade to attack from near where the A Battery was\u2014that is, from the west\u2014the 1st Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers from near the main artillery position, or the south. Between these battalions were the 1st Bevon and 2nd Gordons in support. The Rifle Brigade being extended to about ten paces, had reached a point 800 yards west of the kopje when there opened a terrific rifle-fire both from the kopje and from hills north of the railway. The attackers lay down, then after a great effort by our artillery the Rifle Brigade again advanced by rushes, and \"there never was a waver from start to finish\". The Boers of course bolted, but a pom-pom complete and 19 prisoners were taken: 14 of their dead were found. The Rifle Brigade lost 3 officers killed or mortally wounded, and 21 riflemen killed or died of wounds; 7 officers and 63 men were wounded. The losses of the other battalions were very slight. Many heroic deeds were done in the assault. Rifleman Durrant for carrying Corporal Weller a distance of 200 yards under a very heavy fire got the VC.\n\nGeneral Buller said: \"The honours of the assault belong to the Rifle Brigade, as they had to attack that part of the kopje which had been most protected from our artillery-fire; but all the troops did splendidly, and the carrying of such a position, held as it was by resolute men (the famous Johannesburg Zarps), will always remain present to the minds of those who witnessed it as a most gallant feat of arms\". After referring to the excellent way the maxims were handled and other dispositions made, Sir Redvers remarks: \"The loss of the post at Bergendal led to the enemy abandoning in great haste the whole of their immensely strong position about Dalmanutha, and forced them to withdraw in great confusion beyond Machadodorp. In fact the capture of Bergendal by the Rifle Brigade and Inniskilling Fusiliers cleared the whole of the high veldt of the enemy\".\n\nSix officers and 8 non-commissioned officers and men of the 2nd Rifle Brigade were mentioned in General Buller's despatch of 13th September. Four officers and 3 non-commissioned officers were also mentioned in his final despatch.\n\nThe battalion crossed the railway along with General Buller and moved north towards Lydenburg, which, after some fighting, they reached on 7th September, and in that district they remained for a considerable time. Henceforth they were to have plenty of work and a fair amount of hardship, but they were to see no fighting to be compared with Bergendal. During the remainder of the campaign they were employed in the Eastern Transvaal. In March 1901 three companies accompanied Colonel Park on a night raid on Kruger's Post, which was entirely successful. In April the battalion was put into a column under General W Kitchener, and for the next three months did much hard marching, chiefly north of the Delagoa Railway. About the end of July 1901 the battalion took over a number of posts about Middelburg and garrisoned these for a long period.\n\nFor notes as to commendations by Lord Roberts, and also those earned under Lord Kitchener, see 1st Battalion.\n\n4th Battalion\n\nThe 4th Battalion sailed from England about 15th December 1901, and after their arrival in South Africa took part in the closing scenes in the Orange River Colony, when the infantry held the lines and the mounted men did the driving.\n\nComposite Rifle Battalion\n\nTowards the close of 1899 there arrived in Natal various drafts, among whom were the reservists for the 2nd Rifle Brigade, which had sailed from Crete before war was declared, and for the 1st and 2nd King's Royal Rifles, which had both been in South Africa before that date. These men were formed into a battalion commanded by Major Montagu-Stuart-Wortley of the King's Royal Rifles. During the time General Buller was at Spion Kop and Vaal Krantz the battalion was at Frere and afterwards at Chieveley, assisting Major General Barton in guarding the line and rail-head and in making demonstrations.\n\nIn the last and successful endeavour to relieve Ladysmith the battalion was put into the 11th (Lancashire) Brigade under Major General Wynne and had an honourable share in the fourteen days' fighting. They were the first troops to enter Colenso on 20th February. Next day they crossed the river, and on the 22nd had heavy fighting, gaining various positions, which were, however, as difficult to hold as to seize. On the night of the 22nd the Boers attacked the positions, coming up very close. Captain Baker-Carr's company rushed out with fixed bayonets, killed several of the enemy, and drove them off. On the 23rd it was necessary to relieve two companies holding two kopjes in advance.\n\nThe relief had to be effected by men and officers rushing out singly. In this movement 3 officers were wounded. On the 27th the battalion was posted on the slopes south of the river, and along with the Border Regiment was employed all day in long-range firing on the Boer positions.\n\nThree officers of the battalion were mentioned in General Buller's despatch of 30th March and 3 men recommended for the distinguished conduct medal. Seven additional officers were mentioned in the general's final despatch. After marching into Lady-smith the men joined their regiments. An account of the battalion's work is given in the Rifle Brigade Chronicle of 1900.\n\nGeneral Buller, in his despatch of 30th March 1900, referring to Major Montagu-Stuart-Wortley, said, \"I was much struck by the way in which a battalion made up of the drafts of three regiments, and officered chiefly by second lieutenants, worked under his command\"."}, {"url": "https://www.northeastmedals.co.uk/british_regiment/rifle_brigade.htm", "page_content": "The Prince Consort's Own (Rifle Brigade) 1800 - 1966\n\n\n\nSome Titles..... 95th Regiment of Foot 1802 The Rifle Brigade 1816 The Prince Consort's Own Rifle Brigade 1862 The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) 1921 3rd Green Jackets, The Rifle Brigade 1958 Earliest recognised formation: 1800, as an experimental corps of riflemen.

Below the bottom arm of the cross is a tablet inscribed PENINSULA. Slider to reverse.\n\nHistory note\n\nBadge of pattern worn from 1910 until 1937. The predecessor Regiment was raised in 1800 as The Experimental Corps of Riflemen, also known as the Rifle Corps or Manningham's Sharpshooters, after Colonel Coote Manningham who had raised the unit. The Regiment's personnel were recruited from across the Army and their weapon was the Baker Rifle. As its name suggests, this was an experimental body that aimed to develop skirmish and scouting tactics, allied with highly accurate shooting skills where individual targets were selected rather than relying on mass volley fire. Such a skill-set had been identified as desirable following experience in North America. In 1803 the Regiment joined the 43rd and 52nd Regiments, recently designated as light infantry, at Shorncliffe and trained in appropriate tactics under their own Colonel and under Sir John Moore of Light Infantry fame. In 1803 the unit was re-designated 95th Regiment of Foot, and again in 1812 as 95th Regiment of Foot (Riflemen). By 1816 the Regiment had grown to three battalions and it became a Brigade, specifically The Rifle Brigade, discarding its Regimental number. In 1862 the name was changed to The Prince Consort's Own Rifle Brigade, commemorating the fact that he had been the Regiment's Colonel for nine years at the time of his death the previous year. Thereafter there were numerous minor changes to the name, for reasons that are obscure, largely to do with the use or otherwise of the definite article in the title. In 1868 the Regiment became Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) and in July 1881 (although not affected by the Cardwell/Childers reforms of that year) the name changed to Prince Consort's Own (Rifle Brigade). In 1882 it changed to The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) and in 1920 it settled on Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own). The badge had a similarly disturbed history. The first version of the cap badge seems to have been adopted around 1868, the principal element being a Maltese Cross with a central circlet bearing the Regiment's name, in the centre of which was a crowned bugle. The cross was surrounded by a laurel wreath, with a crown above all. Battle honours from the Peninsula War were embossed on the arms of the cross and other honours on scrolls in various positions. The details of how these elements were displayed, however, changed over time. The crown at the top of the badge was originally a Guelphic crown, this being the design of crown forming part of the Royal Guelphic Order, instituted in 1815 by the Prince Regent but from 1837 becoming a Hanoverian Order. Its connection with the Regiment is said to originate with the fact that the Duke of Wellington, Colonel of the Regiment from 1820 to 1852, had been admitted to the Guelphic Order in 1816. This crown became a badge of the Regiment in 1820 and was later adopted into the cap badge. The Guelphic crown has also become associated with the Prince Consort, and with British Regiments considered the \"Prince Consort's Own\". Between 1903 and 1956 the crown changed to an Imperial (King's) crown before reverting very briefly to the Guelphic pattern. The laurel wreath of the badge up to 1910 carried two scrolls on each side, bearing battle honours from the Crimea. After 1910 fourteen such scrolls were carried. In 1937 the number of scrolls remained the same but with some changes to the honours named. 1937 saw other changes. Two First World War honours displaced the honour PENINSULA that had hitherto been carried at the foot of the cross, the latter being transferred to the top arm of the cross. A new scroll was added to the foot of the badge, carrying PRINCE CONSORT'S OWN, and the name of the Regiment carried on the circlet at the centre of the cross became THE RIFLE BRIGADE rather than just RIFLE BRIGADE as hitherto. The final changes came in 1956 when, in addition to the re-adoption of the Guelphic crown at the top of the badge, all battle honour scrolls were removed from the laurel wreath and the Regimental name on the central circlet reverted to RIFLE BRIGADE. A Naval crown superscribed \"COPENHAGEN 2 April 1801\" was added below the cross, commemorating the services of the Regiment aboard the fleet at that battle. In 1958 the Regiment became part of the Green Jacket Brigade and adopted the Brigade badge. Though the brigade wore a Greenjackets shoulder flash, each individual unit wore its own epaulette badge, the Rifle Brigade with a black RB, the 2nd a KRRC, and the 1st wore a 43/52. Each regiment kept its own coloured NCO's stripes and marksmanship badges. In 1966 the Brigade became the Royal Green Jackets Regiment, the Rifle Brigade becoming \"3rd Battalion The Royal Green Jackets (The Rifle Brigade)\". In 1968 the Rifle Brigade reference was dropped. In 1992 they became 2nd Battalion with the disbandment of 1st Battalion, the old Ox & Bucks. In 2007 a new regiment, The Rifles, was formed from former units of the Light Infantry, Green Jacket and Wessex Brigades. The 2nd Battalion Royal Green Jackets became 4th Battalion The Rifles."}, {"url": "https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rifle_Brigade_Chronicle.html?id=3BN-5WV8tLEC", "page_content": "Shop for Books on Google Play\n\nBrowse the world's largest eBookstore and start reading today on the web, tablet, phone, or ereader.\n\nGo to Google Play Now \u00bb"}, {"url": "https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F267766", "page_content": "This website uses cookies\n\nWe place some essential cookies on your device to make this website work.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to use additional cookies to remember your settings and understand how you use our services.\n\n\n\nThis information will help us make improvements to the website."}, {"url": "https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/kings-royal-rifle-corps", "page_content": "Origins\n\nIn 1754, war broke out in North America over longstanding territorial disputes between British and French colonists. Both sides raised their own troops and were supported by military units from their parent nations and allies.\n\nAt first, the British struggled to adapt to the irregular style of fighting they encountered in the forests of the American frontier. By 1756, they had formed a new regiment to help address this, raised from Swiss and German settlers in the colonies of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania. This four-battalion regiment also recruited men directly from Germany, as well as British volunteers from other regiments. Its soldiers could move quickly and were trained to use natural cover.\n\nInitially given the numeral 62, it was renumbered as the 60th (Royal American) Regiment of Foot in 1757."}], "James Clarke served during the Indian Mutiny.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/event/Indian-Mutiny", "page_content": "Indian Mutiny , also called Sepoy Mutiny or First War of Independence , widespread but unsuccessful rebellion against British rule in India in 1857\u201359. Begun in Meerut by Indian troops ( sepoys ) in the service of the British East India Company , it spread to Delhi , Agra , Kanpur , and Lucknow . In India it is often called the First War of Independence and other similar names.\n\nBackground\n\nTo regard the rebellion merely as a sepoy mutiny is to underestimate the root causes leading to it. British paramountcy\u2014i.e., the belief in British dominance in Indian political, economic, and cultural life\u2014had been introduced in India about 1820. The British increasingly used a variety of tactics to usurp control of the Hindu princely states that were under what were called subsidiary alliances with the British. Everywhere the old Indian aristocracy was being replaced by British officials. One notable British technique was called the doctrine of lapse, first perpetrated by Lord Dalhousie in the late 1840s. It involved the British prohibiting a Hindu ruler without a natural heir from adopting a successor and, after the ruler died or abdicated, annexing his land. To those problems may be added the growing discontent of the Brahmans, many of whom had been dispossessed of their revenues or had lost lucrative positions.\n\nAnother serious concern was the increasing pace of Westernization, by which Hindu society was being affected by the introduction of Western ideas. Missionaries were challenging the religious beliefs of the Hindus. The humanitarian movement led to reforms that went deeper than the political superstructure. During his tenure as governor-general of India (1848\u201356), Lord Dalhousie made efforts toward emancipating women and had introduced a bill to remove all legal obstacles to the remarriage of Hindu widows. Converts to Christianity were to share with their Hindu relatives in the property of the family estate. There was a widespread belief that the British aimed at breaking down the caste system. The introduction of Western methods of education was a direct challenge to orthodoxy, both Hindu and Muslim.\n\nThe mutiny broke out in the Bengal army because it was only in the military sphere that Indians were organized. The pretext for revolt was the introduction of the new Enfield rifle. To load it, the sepoys had to bite off the ends of lubricated cartridges. A rumour spread among the sepoys that the grease used to lubricate the cartridges was a mixture of pigs\u2019 and cows\u2019 lard; thus, to have oral contact with it was an insult to both Muslims and Hindus. There is no conclusive evidence that either of these materials was actually used on any of the cartridges in question. However, the perception that the cartridges were tainted added to the larger suspicion that the British were trying to undermine Indian traditional society. For their part, the British did not pay enough attention to the growing level of sepoy discontent."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/1857-indian-uprising-and-the-british-empire/EADA62EDC4D96A6ED28024EB4FFAC4D5", "page_content": "Secondary sources\n\nAlapatt , George K. \u201c The Sepoy Mutiny of 1857: Indian Indentured Labour and Plantation Politics in British Guiana .\u201d Journal of Indian History 59 , 1\u20133 ( 1981 ), 295 \u2013 314 .\n\nAnderson , Clare . \u201c Convict Passages in the Indian Ocean .\u201d In Many Middle Passages: Forced Migration and the Making of the Modern World , ed.

J. Clarke, Bengal Medical Department; attached to Sir Henry Havelock's Column, Clarke took part in the first relief of Lucknow, tending the wounded amongst the Residency's squalid conditions while under continuous enemy fire.\n\n\n\nTwice mentioned in despatches for his invaluable service, Clarke went on to become Principal Medical Officer to the 1883 Akha Expedition\n\n\n\nIndian Mutiny 1857, 2 clasps, Defence of Lucknow, Lucknow (A, Surgn. J. J. Clarke, 3rd Bn. Bengal Art.); Indian Mutiny 1857, 2 clasps, Relief of Lucknow, Lucknow (Asst. Surgn. J. J. Clarke.), good very fine (2)\n\n\n\nJohn James Clarke was born in June 1827. Already a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons, he was appointed Assistant Surgeon with the Bengal Medical Establishment, Meerut Circle, on 14 May 1853. Clarke was serving at Bandha in Oudh on 10 May 1857, when the Indian Mutiny began at Meerut. He managed to escape from mutinous sepoys, joining General Sir Henry Havelock's column at Cawnpore on 6 August. Havelock assigned Olphert's Battery of Bengal Horse Artillery to Clarke's medical care, a role he ably fulfilled in the actions at Mungawar and the Alumbagh.\n\n\n\nHavelock's column fought through the narrow streets of Lucknow, finally reaching the beleaguered Residency on 25 September. For the ensuing two months, Clarke laboured in the appalling conditions of the garrison's hospital, under constant bombardment from rebel artillery. Some of the hospital's patients were shot in their beds by snipers positioned in high buildings overlooking the compound (Edwardes 1973, 89). Assistant Surgeon Francis Collins, 5th Northumberland Fusiliers, recalled the horror in his diary (see Lot 141, April 2018):'The hospitals here are miserable, staff deficient, no food for sick men, no clothing; and the consequence is that many poor fellows, who could probably recover with proper treatment and nutritious food, die off from sheer filth and starvation. Very few amputation cases have recovered, you will be shocked with the bill of mortality within the trenches of Lucknow when it reaches you\u2026 It is a sad state of things and you may imagine with what anxiety we are looking for reinforcements.'\n\n\n\nWith the arrival of Sir Colin Cambell's force on 19 November, the Residency's garrison was finally relieved and evacuated. Clarke served under Sir James Outram while he held the Alumbagh against repeated assaults. He was present at the capture of Lucknow by Sir Colin Campbell in March 1858, again giving medical provision to Olphert's Battery. During operations to suppress final pockets of resistance in Oudh, he took medical charge of the 1st Sikh Irregular Cavalry. For these services, Clarke was mentioned in despatches (London Gazette, 31 March 1858).\n\n\n\nClarke was promoted to Surgeon on 15 June 1864. Returning to England, he qualified as a Doctor of Medicine at St. Andrew's in 1872. Advanced to Surgeon-Major in May 1873, he again served in India, becoming Deputy Surgeon-General on 20 December 1879. His final posting was to the North-East Frontier, as Principal Medical Officer for the expedition against the Akha in southern China (1883-1884), a role for which he was again mentioned in despatches.\n\n\n\nClarke retired from the service with the rank of Surgeon-General on 14 January 1884 (London Gazette, 8 April 1884 and 3 October 1884), and was awarded a Good Service Pension.\n\n\n\nRecommended reading:\n\n\n\nEdwardes, M., A Season in Hell: Defence of the Lucknow Residency (London, 1973).\n\n\n\nSubject to 5% tax on Hammer Price in addition to 20% VAT on Buyer\u2019s Premium.

He was admired and respected not only in his own community, but also in many other districts of Liverpool where his enviable reputation had spread.\n\nBorn in Georgetown, British Guyana, Jim arrived in Liverpool in 1900, as a fourteen-year-old stowaway aboard a cargo vessel. The priests of St.Augustine\u2019s, Great Howard Street, found him cold and hungry wandering around the streets, and took him into the presbytery where they provided food and shelter. Later they arranged lodgings for the youngster with a local Irish family, and soon the well-mannered likeable young-man became a popular member of the community. In 1914, he was married to Elizabeth Murphy, in the church of Our Lady of Reconciliation, Eldon Street, and set up home in Elizabeth Terrace, Silvester Street. In later years as the family grew-up, the family moved to Ashfield Cottages, in St Sylvester\u2019s parish. He was a natural athlete, ideally built for the sports he loved \u2013 swimming, running, and boxing, yet despite his incredible sporting achievements, he remained a humble and kind person who cherished his family and friends The family were very close and in the summer months Jim often took them all over to New Brighton on the ferry-boat. He had a passion for music and particularly liked to listen to the renowned American singer Paul.Robeson. He worked as a docker in the North-end of Liverpool, and each evening, groups of youngsters would wait for him coming home, because he always brought them \u2018handfuls\u2019 of peanuts, which they took home and roasted on a shovel over a coal-fire.\n\nThroughout his lifetime he was a tremendously gifted swimmer and from an early age his capability was far superior to that of youngsters of his own age. During his adult life, Jim used his swimming skills to save the lives of many people who were in danger of drowning in the River Mersey and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The deep canal ran between Burlington Street and Athol Street, not far from where Jim lived, and many children although they had been forbidden to do so, went swimming or fishing in the canal and were soon in difficulties. As soon as he was alerted by neighbours or police that someone was in danger, Jim would race to the spot, dive in and swim at amazing speed to rescue the person. He saved the lives of many children in the canal, and between 1911-1916, he bravely rescued several seamen and dock-workers from the River Mersey. He started his swimming career with the Wavertree Swimming Club, where he won many medals between 1908-1910, but he also swam for Bootle, Waterloo, and Everton Swimming Clubs. He made a very valuable contribution to the history of the Everton Swimming Club, being instrumental in their winning the coveted North Lancashire League Cup on many occasions. During these years he was often called upon by the Liverpool Police, to assist with the coaching of the Police Boxing and Swimming teams. He was very involved in charity work, frequently donating some of his more elaborate trophies to various organisations to raise money for their appeals.\n\nThere were instances when the police were unable to locate the body of a drowned person, and on these occasions they would enlist the assistance of Jim Clarke. Calling to his home or his place of work the police would quickly take him to the scene of the tragedy. He would dive in and remain underwater for an incredibly long period of time. Occasionally surfacing for air, he would dive repeatedly until he eventually located and recovered the body. Having saved numerous children from drowning, and having been involved in the recovery of so many bodies and witnessing the sorrowful aftermath, Jim was convinced that positive efforts should be made to ensure that all local school-children were able to swim. He expressed his concerns to the authorities and largely due to his initiative and enthusiasm, the children from local schools were brought along to Burroughs Gardens Baths, where Jim was responsible for teaching countless numbers of youngsters to swim.\n\nFor more than forty years he delighted swimming gala spectators all over the country with his skilful display of synchronised swimming. One of his favourite routines was a swimming demonstration he called \u2018Me and My Shadow\u2019, which he performed with one of his swimming colleagues. He would swim underwater whilst his partner swam on the surface, turning and diving in perfect harmony, the pair enthralled the crowds wherever they performed. Another display of his ability to remain underwater was to put a bucket over his head and sit on the bottom of the baths singing \u2018Oh My Darling Clementine\u2019. Jim continued to give exhibitions of his swimming skills up to several months before his death in 1946, at the age of sixty. Swimmers and officials throughout the Liverpool area, were saddened at the news of the death of their old comrade, as were his friends and neighbours who had such genuine respect and admiration for him. He was regarded as a local hero in the Scotland/Vauxhall district and on the day of his funeral, the children from the local schools of St,Anthony\u2019s and St.Sylvester\u2019s, lined the pavements from Jim\u2019s home in Ashfield Cottages, to St.Sylvesters Church, where his funeral Mass was conducted. His great friend, Olympic Swimming Champion ,Austin Rawlinson, who became a senior officer in the Liverpool City Police, came to pay his respects to his pal, and to offer condolences to the Clarke family.\n\nJim Clarke, a well-respected gentleman, who made such a positive contribution to the well-being of his fellow man, remains a legend in the Scotland/Vauxhall neighbourhood, and today his family speak with pride of their fathers achievements and the honest way in which he lived his life, always looking for the good in people and helping out wherever he could. In 1986, a fitting tribute was made to Jim Clarke\u2019s name, when a local street was named after him. James Clarke Street, which runs between Tatlock Street and Hornby Walk, is not far from where he once lived, and where many of the older generation still recall his name with affection.\n\nHistory\n\nA PLAQUE honouring the Liverpool hero who taught children to swim after rescuing school children from the Leeds Liverpool Canal, was unveiled November 18, 2008 at Liverpool Aquatics Centre in Wavertree.\n\nThe late James Clarke, who became a champion swimmer and boxer across Liverpool was remembered\n\nA blue plaque was unveiled by his only surviving daughter Winnie Clarke, 75, and the great-granddaughter of the man who adopted James as a young boy.\n\nBorn in British Guyana, Clarke arrived in Liverpool in 1898 as a 14-year-old stowaway. He was found wandering the docks by Edward Crawford who brought him to his home in Vauxhall.\n\nEdward and his wife applied for James to become a resident and had him baptised as a Catholic.\n\nIt was at the home in Eldon Street that Edward taught James how to box in the cellar, which was converted into a boxing gym.\n\nHe went on to defy the racists by marrying a white-Irish woman, Elizabeth Murphy in 1914 in the Church of Our Lady of Reconciliation, in Eldon Street, Vauxhall. They set up home in Elizabeth Terrace and had 13 children.\n\nAs well as becoming a top boxer he went on to win numerous swimming medals between 1908-1910.\n\nHe was a member of Wavertree and Everton swimming clubs winning the Lancashire League Cup and captained Woolton Polo team.\n\nHe became a local hero and was admired across the city after rescuing numerous children who got into difficulty in the canal at the back of his home.\n\nHe began to visit schools to encourage children to learn to swim and held swimming lessons for everyone at the local pool.\n\nOne of his favourite tricks was sitting underwater on the bottom of the pool with a bucket over his head either drinking a glass of lemonade or singing \u201cOh My Darling Clementine\u201d.\n\nHis daughter, near to tears after pupils from St Hugh\u2019s Catholic Primary performed a short play on James\u2019 life, said he would have been delighted by the plaque.\n\nWinnie Clarke said: \u201cI was evacuated during the war and when I returned to Liverpool my father took ill with TB and died a year later.
