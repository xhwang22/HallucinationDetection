The most influential was Boston Congregationalist minister Jonathan Mayhew (1720-1766).\n\nDeclaration of Independence signer Robert Treat Paine called Mayhew America\u2019s \u201cFather of Civil and Religious Liberty.\u201d Especially important was his January 30, 1750, address, which was widely printed and read. Given for the centennial of Charles I\u2019s execution, Mayhew argued that obedience is not the due of oppressive governments because such tyranny violates the divinely-instituted purpose of government to benefit the people. And if rebellion against Charles for eviscerating British liberty was justifiable, the same arguments applied to Americans\u2019 loss of liberty under George III.\n\nAs we commemorate Mayhew, reconsider his argument for our liberty, which is safe only when we recognize its fundamental importance\u2014an argument so important John Adams called it \u201cthe spark that ignited the American Revolution.\u201d\n\n\"Such as really performed the duty of magistrates would be enemies only to the evil actions of men\u2026But how is this an argument that we must honor and submit to\u2026such as are not a common blessing, but a common curse, to society...If magistrates are unrighteous\u2026the main end of civil government will be frustrated. And what reason is there for submitting to that government, which does by no means answer the design of government?\" \"[We have] the duty of a cheerful and conscientious submission to civil government, from the nature and end of magistracy\u2026to punish evildoers\u2026But\u2026 what can be more absurd than an argument thus framed? 'Rulers are, by their office, bound to consult the public welfare and the good of society: therefore you are bound to\u2026submit to them, even when they destroy the public welfare\u2026in direct contradiction to the nature and end of their office.'\" \"Tyrants and public oppressors are not entitled to obedience.\" \"The end of all civil government [is] the good of society\u2026a contrary end\u2026is a plain and positive reason against submission\u2026nothing [is] more directly contrary to common sense, than\u2026that millions of people should be subjected to the arbitrary, precarious pleasure of one single man; so that their estates, and every thing that is valuable in life\u2026shall be absolutely at his disposal.\" \"No government is to be submitted to, at the expense of that which is the sole end of all government\u2014the common good and safety of society...The only reason of the institution of civil government; and the only rational ground of submission to it, is the common safety and utility. If therefore, in any case, the common safety and utility would not be promoted by submission to government, but the contrary, there is no ground or motive for obedience and submission.\" \"Authority [is] a trust committed by the people\u2026all besides is mere lawless force and usurpation; neither God nor nature, having given any man a right of dominion over any society, independently of that society\u2019s\u2026consent.\" \"Resistance\u2026[is] a most righteous and glorious stand, made in defense of the natural and legal rights of the people, against the unnatural and illegal encroachments of arbitrary power.. to exercise a wanton licentious sovereignty over the properties, consciences and lives of all the people.\" \"The prerogative and rights of the [ruler] are stated, defined and limited by law\u2026 he cannot, while he confines himself within those just limits\u2026injure and oppress \u2026 as soon as the prince sets himself up above law\u2026he has no more right to be obeyed.\"\n\nFranklin Cole considered Jonathan Mayhew \u201cthe first of the Revolutionary preacher-patriots.\u201d Aware that \u201cWise and brave and virtuous men are always friends to liberty,\u201d Mayhew recognized that freedom was an incomparable blessing. And what was true then with regard to a king remains true of government leadership now. Today, we need to reawaken to that knowledge and rekindle our commitment to it, for freedom remains under fire."}, {"url": "https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-68708", "page_content": "Page of\n\nPrinted from Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Experience Mayhew, of Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where he was born, October 8, 1720. He was a descendant, in the fourth generation, from Thomas Mayhew, the first English settler and proprietor of that island. In early life he gave indications of great vigor of mind and an unyielding firmness of purpose, and under the influence of a Christian education imbibed a deep reverence for religion, without, however, as it would seem, at any time receiving the doctrines of the accredited orthodox creed. Of the particulars of his childhood and early youth no record now remains; but it seems probable that he fitted for college under the instruction of his father. While young Mayhew was an undergraduate at Cambridge, he made a visit to York, in Maine, at the time of a great revival in that place; and it would seem that the observations which he made then had much to do in giving direction to his feeling and speech about the irrational extravagance in religion ever afterwards. He graduated with honor in 1744, being then twenty-four years of age.\n\nDuring the three years immediately subsequent to his leaving college, he seems to have been engaged part of the time in teaching, part of the time in the study of theology at Cambridge, and it is thought that he spent a short time also in the family of Dr. Gay, of Hingham.\n\nHis earliest efforts in the pulpit excited no inconsiderable attention. The church in Cohasset soon gave him a call to settle among them, but he declined it. On the 6th of March, 1747, the West Church in Boston invited him to become their pastor. From its origin in 1737 the West Church had been suspected of liberal tendencies by the stricter Puritans of the neighboring churches. Its first minister, William Hooper, for whom or by whom the church was gathered, was certainly not a Calvinist in his theology. In one of his Thursday Lectures he gave great offence to his brother ministers, who subjected him to intolerant criticism on account of what they deemed his heresies concerning the divine nature. Stung by their arbitrary indictment, he withdrew to the fellowship of the Church of England, and was afterwards the rector of Trinity Church in Boston. His son, a Harvard graduate, was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Hooper had not failed to communicate his own instinctive independence of mind and breadth of vision to his people of the West Church; and, in their choice of Mayhew to be his successor, they virtually challenged the stricter churches with the controversy which soon ensued.\n\nOn the day first appointed for the ordination only two of the clergymen invited were in attendance, owing, as it was understood, to rumors about the theological unsoundness of the candidate. Those two did not think proper to proceed, but advised the calling of another and a larger council. This advice was complied with. A council consisting of fourteen ministers, not one of whom, however, was from Boston, was convoked; and ten of these assembled on the 17th of June, and harmoniously inducted the candidate into office. Most of the members of the council who were present were reckoned among the \u201cliberal\u201d men of that day, though there must have been considerable difference in their religious views; and Dr. Appleton (of Cambridge) at least was understood to sympathize doctrinally with the stricter school. The sermon on the occasion was preached by Dr. Gay, of Hingham, and the charge was given by the father of Mr. Mayhew.\n\nThat Mayhew\u2019s liberal opinions were already considered heretical may be inferred not only from the fact that no Boston minister took part in his ordination, but from another equally significant circumstance; namely, that he never became a member of the Boston Association of Congregational Ministers. It was customary to apply for admission; but it is presumed that he never applied, as no record of any such application appears in the minutes. In consequence of this he did not join with the other ministers of Boston in maintaining the Thursday Lecture, though he soon set up a Weekly Lecture in his own church which excited great attention, and attracted many people from other churches in the town. Most of the discourses which were preached on these occasions were subsequently published. In a letter which he wrote to his father, not long after his settlement, he says, \u201cThe clergy of the town stand aloof from me, and I have to study hard, so that I cannot soon visit you as I intended and desired.\u201d This practical exclusion from orthodox fellowship was not without justification, for Mayhew\u2019s opinions were certainly alien to the prevailing theology of New England. He was a thorough radical, a redoubtable pioneer. From his pulpit, two years after his settlement, his friend, young Lemuel Briant, of Braintree (Quincy), preached the sermon that John Adams called the first gun of the Unitarian controversy. If that sermon was the signal gun, Mayhew\u2019s discourses in the succeeding years were a whole battery of heavy artillery. He did not practice the reticence which marked so many of his contemporaries who really shared many of his convictions. He spoke out with fearless candor and tremendous force. He was, as described by one of his successors, the \u201cfirst preacher in Boston of an un-trinitarian God, most potent clerical asserter in America of civil and religious freedom \u2026 a master-workman, Christ-like, who broke down the partition wall between secular and religious affairs, peerless in intellect \u2026 a communicant who, fresh from the table of the Lord\u2019s Supper, wrote to James Otis: \u201cCommunion of churches! Why not communion of the colonies?\u201d\n\nIf Dr. Gay diffused liberal sentiments by personal intercourse and Dr. Chauncy by his voluminous publications, Dr. Mayhew was the orator of the movement towards the reaffirmation of pure Christianity. When Dr. John G. Palfrey, the historian of New England, was asked to name the representative American orator whose statue should stand with those of Demosthenes, Cicero, and Chatham in the decoration of a public building, he answered, \u201cJonathan Mayhew.\u201d Robert Treat Paine declared him the father of civil and religious liberty in America. Dr. Bartol called him \u201cthe great American divine,\u201d saying,\n\nOthers have doubtless excelled him in particular areas, as Edwards in metaphysical talent and Hopkins in application to theological studies, Channing in extent of moral reflection, Buckminster in peculiar charms of speech; but, in broad relation to the public welfare, in power to unseal the fountains of influence into rivers which, like mountain streams, determine the very shape and fashion of a country, he conspicuously transcended them all\u2026. For grandeur of aim and mighty will to bring to pass his purposes put him in the first rank of human spirits.\n\nBut, while Mayhew by temperament and by opportunity was chiefly influential as an orator, yet he was also a reformer, a scholar, and a trenchant writer on themes both theological and political. It is by his books and his controversial pamphlets that the generations that know not the charm of his personality and the power of his speech must chiefly discover his quality. His writings clearly indicate the extent of his departure from the prevalent theology of his time.\n\nIn 1755 he published a volume of sermons on the \u201cDoctrines of Grace.\u201d At the end of the volume is a sermon on the shortness of life, in which there is a note on the doctrine of the Trinity, which betrayed the fact that he had become a Unitarian. Dr. Mayhew was, at this time, scribe of the Massachusetts Convention of Congregational Ministers. When the scribe was to be appointed the next year, some member of the body rose, and objected to the re-election of Dr. Mayhew. Said another member, \u201cThere is no danger of his getting any Arianism into the minutes of the convention.\u201d \u201cNot into the text, but he will foist it into some note,\u201d was the reply.\n\nIn 1762 Dr. Mayhew published two sermons delivered on the day of public Thanksgiving, on \u201cThe Extent of the Divine Goodness,\u201d in which he put forth views startlingly modern in scope and tone. The Rev. John Cleaveland, of Ipswich, the next year published \u201cStrictures\u201d on these discourses, which Mayhew and his friends pronounced to be destitute alike of truth and candor. Mayhew wrote a pamphlet of considerable length in reply, in which he pours upon his unfortunate adversary such a torrent of invective as is rarely to be met with in the records of theological controversy.\n\nThe next year the Rev. East Apthorp published a pamphlet entitled \u201cConsiderations on the Institution and Conduct of the Society for Propagating the Gospel,\u201d which occasioned a violent controversy, in which Mayhew bore a prominent part. He wrote a pamphlet entitled \u201cObservations on the Character and Conduct of the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts,\u201d etc. This was answered by several members of the society in America and by Dr. Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury. Mayhew replied to a pamphlet entitled \u201cA Candid Examination of Observations,\u201d etc. This was again answered in an anonymous tract, and this again drew from Mayhew a second defence of his \u201cObservations,\u201d which, though sufficiently pungent, was less scathing than the preceding one.\n\nIn these writings are to be discovered almost all the fundamental principles of modern liberalism, an ardent passion for liberty of conscience and of speech, a vindication of the right of private judgment, an affirmation of character as the only test of faith. Of Calvinism there is practically none, but in its place a free, generous treatment of Scripture, a reaffirmation of the teaching of Jesus, an almost transcendental idea of God, which is a constant surprise to readers who belong to a generation prone to believe that its cherished liberalism is of modern origin. Dr. James Freeman, thirty years afterwards the minister of the first avowedly Unitarian church in Boston, stated that Mayhew had anticipated him in all his theological conclusions. His daughter testified that \u201cthere is no doubt \u2026 of his having asserted the Unity of God, in the most unequivocal manner, as early as the year 1753\u201d; and she quotes passages from unpublished sermons which declare this belief explicitly.\n\nBut Jonathan Mayhew was not only the foremost pulpit orator of New England and a pioneer of religious freedom; he was also the fervent patriot, the torchbearer who lighted the fires of his country\u2019s liberties. He was not only the associate, but the inspirer of the leaders of the patriot cause in the days before the Revolution. James Otis, John and Samuel Adams, James Bowdoin, John Hancock, and Robert Treat Paine were among his intimate friends. He was also the best known of the American Whigs in England, and through an extensive correspondence did much to influence the opinions and actions of the enlightened Englishmen who opposed the arbitrary course of the British government.\n\nIn June, 1766, Dr. Mayhew addressed a letter to James Otis, showing the deep interest which he took in the political state of the country, and how important he considered it that a good understanding should be maintained among the different colonies. In this letter he states incidentally his intention to set out for Rutland the next morning, to assist at an ecclesiastical council. The meeting of the council was on the 10th of June, and he attended and officiated as scribe. The matters referred to the adjudication of the council were of a perplexing nature, tasking in a high degree the feelings as well as the wisdom of its members. Dr. Mayhew returned home in wet weather and on horseback, fatigued in body and mind, and was almost immediately seized with a violent fever. He died on the 9th of July, in the forty-sixth year of his age. Dr. Lowell states the following circumstance:\n\nWhen all hope of his recovery was gone, Dr. Cooper, an orthodox neighbor, said to him, \u201cTell me, dear sir, if you retain the sentiments which you have taught, and what are your views?\u201d With firmness, though with difficulty, he said, taking him affectionately by the hand, \u201cI hold fast mine integrity, and it shall not depart from me.\u201d\n\nDr. Chauncy prayed at his funeral, and it is said to have been the first prayer ever offered at a funeral in Boston, so scrupulous were our fathers to avoid what might seem the least approach to the practice of praying for the dead. Dr. Chauncy preached a funeral sermon on the following Sabbath, and in a fortnight from that time another was preached by the Rev. Dr. Gay.\n\nIn 1756 Dr. Mayhew, at the age of thirty-five, was married to Elizabeth, daughter of John Clark, Esq., of Boston, a lady remarkable for her beauty and accomplishments. After he paid his addresses to her, an attempt was made to prevent the wedding by means of representations to her parents of his being unsound in the faith, but the marriage proved an exceedingly happy one. Dr. Mayhew left two children. His widow was afterwards married to his successor, the Rev. Dr. Howard."}, {"url": "https://colonialnorthamerica.library.harvard.edu/spotlight/cna/catalog/990099580320203941", "page_content": "Mayhew family papers, 1731-1790 and undated\n\nContent Notes\n\nIn English.

He played an influential role in his home country of Scotland and in his adopted country, the United States. Witherspoon was the only clergyman to sign the Declaration of Independence. From 1776 until 1782, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he helped draft the Articles of Confederation, America's first constitution. After the American Revolution (1775\u201383), Witherspoon was twice elected to the New Jersey legislature.\n\n\"A good form of government may hold the rotten materials together for some time, but beyond a certain pitch, even the best constitution will be ineffectual, and slavery must ensue.\"\n\nWitherspoon served as president of College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) from 1768 until 1794. In his role as educator, he taught many students who became leaders in early American public life. His students included future U.S. senators, governors, U.S. Supreme Court justices, and the future author of the U.S. Constitution, James Madison (1751\u20131836; see entry in volume 2), who would one day become the fourth U.S. president. Witherspoon played an important role in the organization of a newly independent and national Presbyterian Church. In 1789, he opened its first general assembly with a sermon and presided until the election of the first moderator (assembly leader).\n\nTwenty years in the Church of Scotland\n\nJohn Witherspoon was born on February 5, 1723, the son of Anne, or Anna, Walker and James Witherspoon, a minister of the Church of Scotland. Witherspoon, one of six children in the family, was born in the village of Gifford in the parish of Yester, Scotland, 18 miles east of Edinburgh Castle. He received his early education at home before attending the preparatory school in Haddington, Scotland. At the age of thirteen, Witherspoon was considered advanced for his age and was admitted to the University of Edinburgh. He studied Latin, Greek, logic, and philosophy. Witherspoon graduated in 1739, at the age of sixteen, with a master of arts degree.\n\nWitherspoon went on to study theology (the research of religious truth and the nature of God) and gained a license to preach on September 6, 1743. He was called as minister of the Church of Scotland parish in Beith, Ayrshire, in 1745, where he was ordained, or formally became a minister. That same year, an invasion by Charles Edward Stuart (1720\u20131788), known as the Young Pretender, threw Scotland into turmoil. Stuart was trying to recapture the throne of England and Scotland for his family after his grandfather, King James II (1633\u20131701; reigned 1685\u201388), had been exiled to Italy for his Roman Catholic beliefs. Witherspoon joined other parish leaders in gathering troops to fight against the rebellion, but he was soon captured by Stuart's forces. He endured a brief but harsh imprisonment in Castle Doune near Stirling. In April 1746, Stuart's forces were defeated by the English army, ending the war. Stuart escaped to Europe where he remained for the rest of his life.\n\nIn reestablishing his life after the war, Witherspoon married Elizabeth Montgomery on September 2, 1748. The couple had ten children, five of whom died during childhood.\n\nThe Church of Scotland faced new challenges when Witherspoon was a young minister. Leaders in the Moderate, or liberal, Party of the church were challenging the Popular Party, which held a more traditional Christian faith. The Moderates were associated with closer ties to the government and selecting clergy by a central authority. The Popular Party favored continued independence of congregations and selecting their own ministers.\n\nWitherspoon was an aggressive leader of the Popular Party, and in 1753 he published a witty satire (literary ridicule) about the Moderate Party called Ecclesiastical Characteristics. Published anonymously in Glasgow, Scotland, the pamphlet came out in multiple editions over the next few years from printers throughout Europe and North America. When his identity as the author became known, Witherspoon gained celebrity status. He continued his attacks on the Moderates' theology with additional publications. In June 1757, Witherspoon was asked to serve at the Laigh Kirk church in Paisley, near Glasgow. There, he continued his stand against the increasing liberalism (nontraditional views) of the Moderate Party. In 1764, the University of St. Andrews awarded Witherspoon an honorary degree of doctor of divinity in recognition of his theological skills and leadership in the Popular Party.\n\nWitherspoon moves to America\n\nWitherspoon was gaining fame abroad and enjoying popularity at home as the lively theological debate went on in the Church of Scotland. American Presbyterians knew of Witherspoon through his writings, which established him as a man of orthodoxy (belief in long-standing church traditions and established doctrine) and a first-rate scholar. He also had a reputation for possessing a good sense of humor to accompany his commonsense philosophy. Witherspoon's name came up when the trustees of the College of New Jersey (see box) found themselves in need of a new president. In 1766, the New York and Philadelphia Presbyterians recruited Witherspoon to come to America to head the college and lead the Presbyterian Church. He was interested in the position, but his wife, Elizabeth, had no interest in leaving Scotland or her family and friends. She had a great fear of crossing the ocean to begin life in a new land, so Witherspoon regretfully declined the offer.\n\nThough Witherspoon had already turned down the offer, negotiations were kept alive by the continued efforts of Benjamin Rush (1745\u20131813; see box), a young American and graduate of the College of New Jersey who was studying medicine in Edinburgh at the time. Rush spent several days with the Witherspoons, calming Elizabeth's fears and talking away her objections. He succeeded in persuading her to move to America, and final arrangements were made. Witherspoon packed up the family's belongings along with three hundred books to add to the college library. The Witherspoons and their five surviving children arrived in Princeton, New Jersey, on August 12, 1768. The students and faculty had arranged a warm reception to make the family feel welcome in their new country. The Witherspoons were greeted a mile out of town and escorted the rest of the way. When they got to the college, the family saw a candle illuminating each window of the institution in celebration of their arrival.\n\nWitherspoon was forty-five years old when he became the sixth president of the College of New Jersey at Princeton. He immediately went to work revising the college curriculum by adding the study of philosophy, history, and public speaking. Witherspoon insisted that his students master the English language so that they would be well equipped to take part in the political and social debates of the day. He introduced French as an elective for students who wanted to study a modern language, and he taught the classes himself. In addition to managing the college's affairs, Witherspoon taught a full load of courses and preached twice each Sunday.\n\nEducation in colonial America began with various religious denominations. They provided instructors and raised the funds to support schools and colleges, not only to ensure scholarly clergymen but also to develop enlightened citizens. The Congregationalists established Harvard and Yale, the Anglicans founded William and Mary, the Baptists established Brown, and the Presbyterians started Princeton.\n\nA religious revival swept through the American colonies in the early eighteenth century. There was an urgent need for ministers to fill the vacancies in existing churches and in the new colonies. Because the Mid-Atlantic colonies showed the greatest need for higher education, several leaders of the Presbyterian Church met to plan the creation of a new institution in New Jersey. Of the original group who met, six were graduates of Yale and one was from Harvard. Their task was to create a new institution, erect buildings, secure financial support, and employ a competent faculty. The organizers solicited financial aid, and on October 22, 1746, New Jersey governor John Hamilton granted them a charter for their college. Trustees were chosen, and Jonathan Dickinson (1688\u20131747) was elected president of the new College of New Jersey. The college opened its doors in the spring of 1747 in Elizabeth, New Jersey.\n\nWhen Dickinson died several months later, the infant college moved 6 miles down the road to Newark, where the new president, Aaron Burr Sr. (1715\u20131757), resided. Finances remained a concern during the early years of the school. In 1753, two delegates were sent to Britain and Ulster, Ireland, in hopes of securing funds for buildings and other financial need. They were successful in their mission, and plans went forward to build a new campus in the little village of Princeton. The quiet country town, once known as \"Prince Town,\" was situated along the road halfway between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and New York City. Near the center of the village, the trustees built a massive stone building called Nassau Hall. Its name was given in memory of King William III (1650\u20131702; reigned 1689\u20131702), who was of the house of Nassau. The distinguished building itself was modeled carefully after King's College in Cambridge, England, but with less ornamentation.\n\nAaron Burr Sr. died in September 1757; three more school presidents died in office between then and the summer of 1766. At that time, the college sought out John Witherspoon from Scotland to serve as its sixth president. Witherspoon would serve from 1768 until his death in 1794.\n\nThe College of New Jersey officially became known as Princeton University in October 1896. Throughout its early history, Princeton carried out its purpose of training clergymen for the ministry and for public service. The institution played a major role in the creation and development of an independent America by training many notable graduates.\n\nThe College of New Jersey had been founded for the express purpose of training young men in ministry to care for the growing Presbyterian Church in America. A split in 1741 left the church divided into Old Side and New Light factions. The Old Side Presbyterians favored traditional means of worship at established churches with trained ministers. The New Light Presbyterians were influenced by the revival movement, which included ministers traveling across the country, often giving sermons in town markets or wherever crowds gathered. Witherspoon experienced great success in reuniting the quarreling sects. His moderate style and earnest desire to produce a well-educated clergy won him support from both sides.\n\nWitherspoon became involved in trying to resolve some financial problems the college was having. He traveled extensively throughout the colonies, raising funds and recruiting\n\nThe young nation was led by a number of bright professionals in the late eighteenth century. Dr. Benjamin Rush was the recognized leader in the medical field.\n\nRush was born in January 1746 near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, John Rush, was a farmer and gunsmith. After graduating from the College of New Jersey, later Princeton, in 1760, Rush served in a medical apprenticeship for six years before sailing to Scotland, where he received a medical degree from the University of Edinburgh. Rush returned to Philadelphia in 1769 and began his medical practice. He also taught medicine and chemistry at the College of Philadelphia, later the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. In 1770, Rush published the first American textbook on chemistry.\n\nRush also became a prominent Patriot during the American Revolution. He served in the Continental Congress in 1776, where he became one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He then served for a year as surgeon general for the Continental Army before resuming his practice and teaching. In 1787, Pennsylvania sent Rush as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention held in his hometown of Philadelphia. Rush supported the new constitution that was drafted at the convention and signed his approval alongside the names of the nation's Founding Fathers. In 1797, President John Adams appointed Rush treasurer of the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, a position he held for the rest of his life.\n\nRush was also a social activist supporting many causes, including education for women. He was also an outspoken critic of slavery and helped establish the abolitionist society (a group opposed to slavery) in Philadelphia. In his medical practice, Rush favored bloodletting, a controversial treatment that supposedly purged disease from a person's body by profuse bleeding. He conducted major bloodletting during the Philadelphia yellow fever epidemics of the 1790s, perhaps causing many deaths simply from the loss of blood. Rush also became a leading expert on mental health and authored the first American book on psychiatry in 1812.\n\nstudents. He cultivated a great deal of goodwill even as he doubled the college's endowment (money donations) within the first year.\n\nAmerican Founding Father\n\nBy 1776, Princeton was attracting nearly as many students as highly popular Yale and enjoyed a record number of graduates. However, the American Revolution put Princeton in a difficult position: The town became a battleground, and at various times the main college building, Nassau Hall, was used as quarters by British and Continental Army troops. The military occupation destroyed much of the college campus and its most important piece of scientific equipment, the Rittenhouse Orrery. The orrery was an apparatus used to show the relative positions and motions of celestial bodies in the solar system. It was a prized possession. The library that Witherspoon had helped expand was also destroyed. Witherspoon worked hard at keeping college in session during the war years.\n\nWitherspoon was a firm supporter of the American colonies in their war against Britain. On June 22, 1776, he was selected by New Jersey as a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Within days, Witherspoon voted for and affixed his signature to the Declaration of Independence. He was the only clergyman to do so. He served in the Continental Congress until November 1782 while he helped draft the Articles of Confederation. Witherspoon won the respect of his colleagues and was appointed to more than one hundred committees; many of the committees dealt with matters of considerable importance, such as negotiations with foreign powers. War also brought personal tragedy when Witherspoon's son James, a 1770 graduate of the College of New Jersey, was killed at the Battle of Germantown in Philadelphia in October 1777.\n\nWhen American victory seemed certain and peace was at hand, Witherspoon resigned from Congress and returned to Princeton full-time in the fall of 1782. The campus buildings and the school's finances were in disarray. Student life in the early years of the republic was bleak because of the damaged facilities and the limited availability of food. Witherspoon set about rebuilding the college, a project to which he would devote the rest of his days. By July 1783, parts of Nassau Hall had been sufficiently repaired to serve a second purpose: For four months that year, the building housed the Continental Congress, bringing such statesmen as George Washington (1732\u20131799; see entry in volume 2), John Adams (1735\u20131826; see entry in volume 1), and Thomas Jefferson (1743\u20131826; see entry in volume 1) to Princeton.\n\nLife after the Revolution\n\nWitherspoon continued the work of restoration at Princeton even as he returned to public service in the New Jersey legislature in 1783. In 1787, Witherspoon was a member of the New Jersey convention that approved the U.S. Constitution. (New Jersey was the third state in the union to approve it.) Five members of the 1787 Constitutional Convention were former students of Witherspoon's. To Witherspoon, religion and politics were intertwined. Religious faith was essential to him if true liberty was to be achieved. Faith and liberty were so connected in his teaching that a generation of Americans was deeply affected. Witherspoon believed that a righteous people needed only limited governing; he therefore taught that a government's main purpose was simply to protect and defend its citizens.\n\nElizabeth Witherspoon, never fully content in her new country, died in 1789. Two years later, John Witherspoon married a twenty-four-year-old widow from York County, Pennsylvania, named Ann Dill. They had two daughters, but only one survived to adulthood. Health problems soon took their toll on Witherspoon. In 1784, he had had a shipboard accident that blinded him in one eye. A fall from his horse injured the other eye, causing it to steadily deteriorate. By 1792, Witherspoon was totally blind. When surgery failed to improve his situation, Witherspoon resigned himself to his fate and continued with his presidential duties with the help of an assistant. During Witherspoon's final years, his son-in-law, Samuel Stanhope Smith, increasingly carried more responsibility for college affairs and was himself elected president of the college in May 1795.\n\nOn November 15, 1794, the seventy-one-year-old Witherspoon died at home on his farm, known as \"Tusculum,\" just outside of Princeton. On November 18, his body was brought to Nassau Hall, where it lay in state while grieving friends, colleagues, and students paid their last respects. Witherspoon was laid to rest in the president's lot at Princeton. He had dedicated his life to service, and he left both college and country in a better state than he had found them.\n\nFor More Information\n\nBooks\n\nBrodsky, Alyn.

He was one of the two founders of the satirical and humorous magazine Punch, and the magazine's joint-editor, with Mark Lemon, in its early days. He is better known, however, for his social research, publishing an extensive series of newspaper articles in the Morning Chronicle, later compiled into the book series London Labour and the London Poor, a groundbreaking and influential survey of the poor of London. As well as influencing literary authors, such as Charles Dickens, Mayhew's research pioneered criminological efforts at understanding the relationship between crime and other variables by the use of maps. He thus contributed not only a striking commentary and documentation of social conditions, but also ideas and techniques for understanding the relationship between these conditions and crime.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nHenry Mayhew was born in London on November 25, 1812, one of seventeen children of Joshua Mayhew. He was educated at Westminster school before running away from his studies to sea, at the age of 12. He then served with the East India Company as a midshipman on a ship bound for Calcutta, India.\n\nIn 1829, he returned to Britain, where he became a trainee lawyer in Wales, working with his father for the next three years. After a while, he decided to enter the career of journalism and became a freelance journalist. He contributed to the The Thief, a readers digest, followed quickly by writing the play Figaro in London, in 1829. Along with continuing to develop his writing, Mayhew briefly managed the Queen's Theatre.\n\nParis and Punch Magazine\n\nIn 1835, unable to support himself by writing, Mayhew found himself seriously indebted, and along with a fellow writer, escaped to Paris to avoid creditors. He spent his time writing, gathering around himself a circle of friends, including William Thackeray and Douglas Jerrold.\n\nOn July 17, 1841, Mayhew co-founded Punch magazine. At its founding, the magazine was jointly edited by Mayhew and Mark Lemon. Initially it was subtitled The London Charivari, a reference to a satirical humor magazine published in France under the title Le Charivari (a work read often while Mayhew was in Paris). Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove puppet, Mr. Punch. Punch was an unexpected success, popular with readers from all classes of society.\n\nIn 1842, Mayhew contributed to the pioneering Illustrated London News. By this time Mayhew had become reasonably secure financially, had settled his debts and married Jane Jerrold, the daughter of his friend Douglas Jerrold.\n\nMayhew then resigned as joint editor of Punch magazine, continuing only as an adviser. He completely severed his connection with the magazine by 1845. His brother Horace stayed on the board of Punch until his death. The Punch years gave Mayhew the opportunity to meet talented illustrators whom he later employed to work on his London Labour and the London Poor.\n\nMid-career\n\nAfter his experience with Punch, Mayhew became involved in several literary adventures, mostly the writing of plays. Two of his plays, But, However and the Wandering Minstrel, were successful whilst the others received minimal attention. In 1849, he received a journalistic assignment that would change his career. The project was sponsored by the Morning Chronicle newspaper, and it involved a large-scale survey of Britain's working poor.\n\nMayhew wrote a series of articles on the life conditions in London\u2019s slums. His writing style was uncompromising and often shocking, causing frequent censorship by the editors. By 1850 Mayhem quit the project, and continued to publish his stories on the subject independently until 1852. These articles were compiled into London Labour and the London Poor.\n\nLondon Labour and the London Poor\n\nThe articles comprising London Labour and the London Poor were initially collected into three volumes in 1851; the 1861 edition included a fourth volume, co-written with Bracebridge Hemyng, John Binny, and Andrew Halliday, on the lives of prostitutes, thieves, and beggars. This Extra Volume took a more general and statistical approach to its subject matter than Volumes 1 to 3.\n\nMayhew\u2019s approach was ethnographic, involving observation and interview. He interviewed everyone\u2014beggars, street-entertainers, market traders, prostitutes, laborers, sweatshop workers, even down to the \"mudlarks\" who searched the stinking mud on the banks of the River Thames for wood, metal, rope, and coal from passing ships, and the \"pure-finders\" who gathered dog feces to sell to tanners. He described their clothes, how and where they lived, their entertainment and customs, and made detailed estimates of the numbers and incomes of those practicing each trade.\n\nMayhew also included biographical sketches of people he met, including those of flower girls, cat and dog meat dealers, and pickpockets. The stories were often heartbreaking, describing the struggle to survive in Victorian London. The books makes fascinating reading, showing how marginal and precarious many people's lives were, in what at the time may have been the richest city in the world.\n\nIn the fourth volume of the book, Mayhew described characteristics and activities of criminals in Britain. He drew detailed maps to illustrate the criminal statistics of each county. Mayhew\u2019s maps were among the earliest attempts to study crime through geographical methods. This volume also included various statistics\u2014the number of illegitimate children per county, rates of teenage marriage, the number of crimes committed by women, and so forth.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter 1852, Mayhem\u2019s life seems to have declined rapidly. He lived in Germany for brief periods, writing three travel books (1856, 1858, 1864) and a biography of the young Martin Luther (1864). All four of those works received minimal attention. He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to write children\u2019s books. He and his wife separated, and in 1865, Mayhem completely disappeared from public view. His wife died in 1880.\n\nHenry Mayhew died in 1887, in London, England.\n\nLegacy\n\nMayhew's work was embraced by and was an influence on Christian Socialists, such as Thomas Hughes, Charles Kingsley, and F. D. Maurice. Radicals also published sizable excerpts from the reports in the Northern Star, the Red Republican, and other newspapers. The often sympathetic investigations, with their immediacy and unswerving eye for detail, offered unprecedented insights into the condition of the Victorian poor. Alongside the earlier work of Edwin Chadwick, they are also regarded as a decisive influence on the thinking of Charles Dickens.\n\nMayhew\u2019s maps of criminal activities were among early attempts to connect crime with geographical areas. His work helped clarify the relationship between crime and other variables, such as urbanization, poverty, and disease. Modern day criminologists have adopted this method of using maps to explore the spatial relationship between criminal activity and other ecological variables.\n\nPublications\n\nMayhew, Henry.

For the English cabinetmaker, see Ince and Mayhew.\n\nGovernor Thomas Mayhew, the Elder (March 31, 1593 \u2013 March 25, 1682) established the first European settlement on Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket and adjacent islands in 1642. He is one of the editors of the Bay Psalm Book, the first book published in the Thirteen Colonies. His *istant Peter Foulger was the grandfather of Benjamin Franklin.\n\nBiography\n\nMarker for Thomas Mayhew homestead in Watertown, M*achusetts\n\nThomas Mayhew was born in Tisbury, in the county of Wiltshire in England. He married Anna (also called Hanna and Abigail) Parkhurst, born about 1600, in Hampshire, England, daughter of Matthew Parkhurst. In 1621 they had a son, Thomas, the Younger, baptised in Hanna's home town of Southampton. Two years later they had another child, Robert Mayhew, baptized in Tisbury.\n\nThe family left England in 1631/2 during the Great Migration of Puritans that brought 20,000 settlers to M*achusetts in thirteen years. Through the agency of Matthew Cradock of London, Mayhew had been appointed to manage properties in Medford, M*achusetts, and to engage in trade and shipbuilding. In or about 1633, Mayhew's wife Anna died, and about 1634 he returned to England for a business meeting with Cradock. While in England, he married Jane Gallion (1602\u20131666), and brought her back to New England with him. Their daughter Hannah was born in 1635, and three more daughters, Mary (1639), Martha (1642), and Bethiah, followed. Martha is the 7th great grandmother to the world-famous singer and songwriter Taylor Swift.\n\nIn 1641, Thomas secured Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, the Elizabeth Islands, and other islands as a proprietary colony from Sir Ferdinando Gorges and the Earl of Stirling. This enabled him to transfer his business operations there. With the help of his son Thomas, a settlement was established and farming and whaling enterprises were begun.\n\nThe Mayhews had great success in regard to Indian policy. Because of the fair treatment of the Indians there, the colony was protected from the bloodshed that occurred elsewhere, in King Philip's War. In 1646, the General Court of M*achusetts directed the religious leaders of the colony to select two among them to serve as missionaries to the natives. So great was the interest aroused by this venture that a society was formed in England also to support the missionaries. Unfortunately a m*ive conflict broke out, called King Philip's War (1675\u201376), which resulted in many deaths of both the settlers and the natives. However, three prominent names appear. They are: John Eliot (known as the Apostle to the Indians); Thomas Mayhew (who was already ministering to the natives); and, three generations later, Eleazar Wheelock, who established \"Doctor Wheelock's Academy for the promotion of Christianity and civility among the savage Indians of this continent\" (now known as Dartmouth College).\n\nIn 1657, the younger Thomas Mayhew was drowned when a ship he was travelling in was lost at sea on a voyage to England. Mayhew's three grandsons Matthew Mayhew (born 1648), Thomas (born 1650), John (born 1652), and other members of his family *isted him in running his business and government.\n\nTranscription of Watertown marker: \"HERE BY THE ANCIENT FORDTHE LANDING AND THE WEIRWAS THE HOMESTALL OFTHOMAS MAYHEW:A LEADER IN WATERTOWN AFFAIRSFROM 1635 TO 1645.AFTERWARDS WITH HIS SON,THE REV. THOMAS MAYHEW,HE LABORED AMONG THE INDIANSAT MARTHA'S VINEYARD.\"\n\nColonizing Dukes County\n\nIn 1641, while engaged in business ventures in the vicinity of Boston, Mayhew succeeded in acquiring the rights to the islands that now cons*ute Dukes County and Nantucket County: Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and the Elizabeth Islands. He bought the County for 40 pounds and two beaver skin hats from William Alexander, the 2nd Earl of Stirling. To resolve a conflicting ownership claim, he also paid off Sir Ferdinando Gorges, thereby acquiring a clear *le.\n\nMayhew established himself as governor of Martha's Vineyard in 1642 and sent his son, Thomas the Younger, with about forty families to settle there. He himself followed four years later. Together he and the younger Thomas established Martha's Vineyard's first settlement and called it Great Harbor, now Edgartown.\n\nRelations with the natives\n\nMayhew and his fellow settlers found a large and economically stable native population of about 3,000 living in permanent villages, led by four sachems (chiefs). Relations between the first settlers and their Wampanoag neighbors were peaceful and courteous. Under the leadership of his son, a minister, they ins*uted a policy of respect and fair dealing with the Wampanoag natives that was unequaled anywhere. One of the first of Mayhew's orders was that no land was to be taken from the native islanders, the Wampanoags, without their consent or without fair payment. From this time forward, the colonial settlers and Wampanoag lived without the bloodshed that marked the history of European colonies elsewhere in the New World.\n\nFrom the beginning, Mayhew had worked to preserve the original political ins*utions of the native population. Religion and government were distinct matters, he told the chiefs. When one of your subjects becomes a Christian, he is still under your jurisdiction. Wampanoag land was guarded against further encroachment by white settlers. So successful were these policies that during the bloody battles of King Philip's War, in 1675-1676, the Vineyard's native population never stirred, although they outnumbered the settlers on the island by twenty to one.\n\nSpreading religion\n\nBy 1660 there were about 85 white people living peaceably among the natives, earning their living by farming and fishing. The Mayhew family, which from that time forth became an integral part of island history, wanted to share its religion with the natives, but the Wampanoags were not too interested, having their own spiritual faith. However, once it was clear that, though Mayhew was the governor, the sachems remained in charge of their people, some became curious about the white man's God. When a native named Hiacoomes expressed an interest, Mayhew invited him into his home and instructed him in English and Christianity. Hiacoomes, in return, taught Mayhew the native language. As soon as Mayhew could converse with the natives, he would some days \"walk 20 miles through uncut forests to preach the Gospel...in wigwam or open field\".\n\nThere is a stained gl* window in the baptismal font in the National Cathedral in Washington D.C. depicting Rev. Thomas Mayhew Jr. baptizing a native.\n\nChange was in the air though, for the world outside this small island was unsettled. There were more visitors from off island and some stayed, challenging the Mayhew government, while Baptists and Methodists arrived to make converts from the established Congregational Church.\n\nFrom colony to aristocracy\n\nThrough a maze of conflicting land grants, changing political allegiances, and settler unrest, Mayhew, who styled himself \"Governour Mayhew\", began to rule his island with an iron hand. The most serious threat to his control came in 1665 when Martha's Vineyard was included in the lands placed under the king's brother, the Duke of York. After much delay, a settlement, worked out in 1671, confirmed the Mayhew patent and named Mayhew \"Governour and Chiefe Magistrate\" for life. At the same time, a patent was issued erecting the Manor of Tisbury in the southwestern part of the island. The Governor and his grandson Matthew were made \"joint Lords of the Manor of Tisbury\", and the inhabitants became manorial tenants subject to the feudal jurisdiction of the Mayhews. This full-fledged feudal manor appears to have been the only such ins*ution actually established in New England.\n\nThe attempt of the Mayhews to create a hereditary aristocracy on the Vineyard met with increasing opposition as more and more colonists arrived. When the Dutch temporarily recaptured New York in 1673, open rebellion broke out and this lasted until the colonial government regained control over New York and restored the authority of the Mayhews on the island. The old patriarch died in 1682, at the age of eight-nine. Nine years later the political rule of his family ended when Martha's Vineyard was annexed by M*achusetts after the Glorious Revolution in England, but the manorial land tenure remained. Although some of the Mayhews clung to the \"pleasant fiction\" of their manorial rights almost until the American Revolution and received token quit rents as late as 1732, feudalism on Martha's Vineyard died the same slow, lingering but certain death it did elsewhere in the colonies.\n\nMissionary work\n\nKenneth Scott Latourette has concluded that the Missionary Mayhews of Martha's Vineyard represent what is probably the longest and most persistent missionary endeavor in the annals of all Christendom. The elder Thomas Mayhew, known for his missionary work, was not concerned for Indian souls when he settled on his island; he sought only to improve his social and economic position. His son, Thomas Mayhew the Younger, is credited with the launching an Indian mission. Like his father, he had emigrated from England. Somewhere, he received a liberal education, apparently from private tutors, and after moving to the Vineyard to begin the white settlement there he became pastor of the small Anglican church as well as acting governor in his father's absence. He soon discovered that he could not refuse the challenge he found among the three thousand Pokanaukets, a branch of the mainland Narragansetts, who far outnumbered the whites, so an effective settlement required friendly relations with the Indians. But Thomas the Younger appears to have been motivated largely by spiritual concern, while his father and other members of the family enjoyed the practical results of the Indian mission. The son gradually abandoned most of his secular tasks and spent the remainder of his life among the natives. Progress was slow at first, but by the end of 1652 there were 283 converts, a school for Indian children, and two Indian meetings each Sabbath. The Praying Indians of Martha's Vineyard who said grace before meals became a topic of conversation on both sides of the Atlantic. Thomas Mayhew the Younger carried on his missionary work with little heed for his personal fortunes. As the elder Mayhew put it, his son had followed this work \"when 'twas bare with him for food and rayment, and when indeede there was nothing in sight any waies but Gods promises.\" The situation was improved somewhat by the formation in 1649 of a London missionary society, usually called the New England Company, which in a few years began to provide substantial aid for the Mayhews and other missionaries.\n\nIn the fall of 1657, Thomas Mayhew the Younger sailed for England on a trip combining an appeal for missionary funds with personal business. After leaving Boston Harbor, the ship was never seen again. The death of his only son at the age of thirty-six was a heavy blow to Mayhew and greatly increased the burdens he carried in old age. He made repeated efforts to find a replacement to continue his son's ministry to the Indians, but no minister who knew the language or was willing to learn could be induced to settle permanently on the island, so at the age of sixty Mayhew, who had started as a merchant, then turned landed proprietor, became a missionary in his son's place. For the next twenty-five years he traveled on foot as far as twenty miles to preach once a week at the Indian *embly or to visit the native camps.\n\nDeath\n\nWhen the venerable Governor Mayhew became ill one Sunday evening in 1682, he calmly informed his friends and relatives that \"his Sickness would now be to Death, and he was well contented therewith, being full of Days, and satisfied with Life\". His great-grandson, Experience Mayhew, a son of John, was only eight at the time, but he clearly remembered being led to the bedside to receive from the dying man a blessing \"in the Name of the Lord\". Matthew Mayhew, the eldest grandson, succeeded his military and civil duties. Rev. John Mayhew, the youngest grandson and grandfather of Jonathan Mayhew, continued his missionary work to the Indians. Thomas, another grandson, became a Judge of M*achusetts.\n\nHis descendant Jonathan Mayhew was a prominent 18th-century Boston clergyman who coined the phrase \"No taxation without representation.\"\n\nDescendants\n\nMatthew Mayhew (1648\u20131710), Martha's Vineyard colonist, politician and missionary\n\nExperience Mayhew (1673\u20131758), Martha's Vineyard colonist and missionary\n\nJoseph Mayhew (1709/10\u20131782), Martha's Vineyard colonist, politician, and missionary\n\nJonathan Mayhew (1720\u20131766), Congregationalist minister and Patriot\n\nJonathan Mayhew Wainwright I (1792\u20131854), Episcopal Bishop of New York\n\nCharles Tupper (1821\u20131915), 6th Prime Minister of Canada\n\nJonathan Mayhew Wainwright II (1821\u20131863) U.S. Navy officer during the American Civil War\n\nElla Edes (1832\u20131916) American writer, newspaper correspondent, and Catholic activist\n\nJonathan M.

However, we actually pay almost no attention to it, leaving us woefully unaware of many critical aspects of our heritage.\n\nOne of the most important but overlooked Revolutionary era influences were New England ministers. Franklin Cole, editor of They Preached Liberty, described them as \"watchmen on...the wall of liberty,\"\u009d making them \"the 'forgotten men' among the heroes of the American Revolution.\"\u009d The most influential was Boston Congregationalist minister, Jonathan Mayhew (1720-1766), who Declaration of Independence signer Robert Treat Paine called \"The Father of Civil and Religions Liberty in Massachusetts and America.\"\u009d\n\nEspecially important was his address of January 30, 1750. On that day, Mayhew delivered a sermon entitled A Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission and Non-Resistance to the Higher Powers, which has been termed \"The Morning Gun of the American Revolution.\"\u009d The sermon, which was printed and, in Adams' words, \"read by everybody,\"\u009d not only in Boston, but throughout the colonies and in London, argued that God sanctioned revolution against tyranny.\n\nMayhew's Discourse took place on the centennial of the execution of Charles I in England. He rejected attempts to efforts to portray Charles as a martyr, insisting that his execution was a Biblically justifiable response to his tyranny. He said that \"Common tyrants, and public oppressors, are not entitled to obedience from their subjects, by virtue of any thing here laid down by the inspired apostle,\" because tyranny violates the divinely instituted purpose of government. But his argument did not just apply to Charles I. If rebellion against Charles for eviscerating British liberty was morally and scripturally justifiable, one could hardly fail to see that the same arguments applied to King George III.\n\nAs we again pass the date on which, over a quarter of a millennium ago, Jonathan Mayhew started what John Adams called \"the spark that ignited the American Revolution,\"\u009d consider his argument for our liberty, which is only safe from assault when we recognize its fundamental importance.\n\n\"...the powers that be, are ordained of God...[But] how does this prove, that those who resist a lawless, unreasonable power, which is contrary to the will of God, do therein resist the will and ordinance of God?\"\n\n\"...such as really performed the duty of magistrates, would be enemies only to the evil actions of men...But how is this an argument, that we must honor, and submit to...such as are not a common blessing, but a common curse, to society!\"\n\n\"...if magistrates are unrighteous...the main end of civil government will be frustrated. And what reason is there for submitting to that government, which does by no means answer the design of government?\"\u009d\n\n\"...the apostle argues the duty of a cheerful and conscientious submission to civil government, from the nature and end of magistracy...to punish evildoers...But does this argument conclude for the duty...to such persons as use all their power to hurt and injure the public?...to such as have no natural and just claim...?\"\u009d\n\n\"For what can be more absurd than an argument thus framed? 'Rulers are, by their office, bound to consult the public welfare and the good of society: therefore you are bound to pay them tribute, to honor, and to submit to them, even when they destroy the public welfare, and are a common pest to society, by acting in direct contradiction to the nature and end of their office'...arguments to enforce submission...conclude only in favor of submission to such rulers...as rule for the good of society, which is the only end of their institution. Common tyrants, and public oppressors, are not entitled to obedience...\"\u009d\n\n\"...the apostle's argument is so far from proving it to be the duty of people to obey, and submit to, such rulers as act in contradiction to the public good, and so to the design of their office, that it proves the direct contrary. For...if the end of all civil government be the good of society...and if the motive and argument for submission to government be taken from the apparent usefulness of civil authority; it follows, that when no such good end can be answered by submission, there remains no argument or motive to enforce it; if...by submission, a contrary end is brought about...here is a plain and positive reason against submission...And therefore, in such cases, a regard to the public welfare ought to make us withhold from our rulers that obedience and subjection which it would, otherwise, be our duty to render to them...when he turns tyrant...we are bound to throw off our allegiance to him, and to resist...Not to discontinue our allegiance, in this case, would be to join with the sovereign in promoting the slavery and misery of that society, the welfare of which, we ourselves, as well as our sovereign, are indispensably obliged to secure and promote...\"\u009d\n\n\"...the apostle...grounding his argument for submission wholly upon the good of civil society...authorizes, and even requires us to make resistance, whenever this shall be necessary to the public safety and happiness...\"\u009d\n\n\"...nothing can well be imagined more directly contrary to common sense, than to suppose that millions of people should be subjected to the arbitrary, precarious pleasure of one single man;so that their estates, and every thing that is valuable in life, and even their lives also, shall be absolutely at his disposal...What unprejudiced man can think, that God made ALL to be thus subservient to the lawless pleasure and frenzy of ONE, so that it shall always be a sin to resist him!\"\u009d\n\n\"...no government is to be submitted to, at the expense of that which is the sole end of all government\u2014the common good and safety of society...The only reason of the institution of civil government; and the only rational ground of submission to it, is the common safety and utility. If therefore, in any case, the common safety and utility would not be promoted by submission to government, but the contrary, there is no ground or motive for obedience and submission, but, for the contrary.\"\n\n\"...authority [is] a trust, committed by the people...all besides, is mere lawless force and usurpation; neither God nor nature, having given any man a right of dominion over any society, independently of that society's approbation, and consent...those in authority may abuse their trust and power to such a degree, that neither the law of reason, nor of religion, requires, that any obedience or submission should be paid to them: but, on the contrary, that they should be totally discarded...\"\u009d\n\n\"A people, really oppressed...to arise unanimously, and to resist their prince, even to the dethroning him, is not criminal; but a reasonable way of indicating their liberties and just rights; it is making use of the means, and the only means, which God has put into their power, for mutual and self-defense. And it would be highly criminal in them, not to make use of this means. It would be stupid tameness, and unaccountable folly, for whole nations to suffer one unreasonable, ambitious and cruel man, to wanton and riot in their misery.\"\n\n\"For what reason, then, was the resistance to king Charles made?...during a reign, or rather a tyranny of many years, he governed in a perfectly wild and arbitrary manner, paying no regard to the constitution and the laws of the kingdom, by which the power of the crown was limited...He levied many taxes upon the people without consent of parliament; and then imprisoned great numbers of the principal merchants and gentry for not paying them. He erected, or at least revived, several new and arbitrary courts, in which the most unheard-of barbarities were committed...He sent a large sum of money, which he has raised by his arbitrary taxes...to raise foreign troops, in order to force more arbitrary taxes upon his subjects. He not only by a long series of actions, but also in plain terms, asserted an absolute uncontrollable power...\"\n\n\u009d\"...on account of king Charles's thus assuming a power above the laws, in direct contradiction to his coronation oath, and governing...in the most arbitrary oppressive manner...resistance was made to him.\"\n\n\"...this resistance which was made...[was] a most righteous and glorious stand, made in defense of the natural and legal rights of the people, against the unnatural and illegal encroachments of arbitrary power. Nor was this a rash and too sudden opposition. The nation had been patient under the oppressions of the crown...and there was no rational hope of redress in any other way\u2014Resistance was absolutely necessary in order to preserve the nation from slavery, misery and ruin...against one which was impiously attempting to overturn law and equity and the constitution; and to exercise a wanton licentious sovereignty over the properties, consciences and lives of all the people...king Charles set himself up above all these...And now, is it not perfectly ridiculous to call resistance to such a tyrant, by the name of rebellion?\"\n\n\"[English] kings hold their title to the throne solely by...the voluntary consent of the people...the prerogative and rights of the crown are stated, defined and limited by law...he cannot, while he confines himself within those just limits which the law prescribes to him as the measure of his authority, injure and oppress the subject. The king...swears to exercise only such a power as the constitution gives him. And the subject...swears only to obey him in the exercise of such a power...From whence it follows, that as soon as the prince sets himself up above law...he has no more right to be obeyed...The subjects' obligation to allegiance then ceases...\"\u009d\n\n\"There is an essential difference...between resisting a tyrant and rebellion...King Charles' government was illegal, and very oppressive... therefore, to resist him, was no more rebellion, than to oppose any foreign invader, or any other domestic oppressor.\"\u009d\n\n\"[King Charles] died an enemy to liberty and the rights of conscience...\"\u009d\n\n\"It is to be hoped that it will prove a standing memento, that Britons will not be slaves; and a warning to all corrupt counselors and ministers, not to go too far in advising to arbitrary, despotic measures...\"\u009d\n\nJonathan Mayhew's role in America's Revolution extends beyond his Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission and Non-Resistance to the Higher Powers. He preached a sermon against the Stamp Act, arguing that the essence of slavery is subjection to others, \"whether many, few, or but one, it matters not,\"\u009d that led to the stamp riots. He coined the phrase \"no taxation without representation.\"\u009d He proposed the idea of Committees of Correspondence.\n\nDespite his many contributions, however, the main reason that Franklin Cole concluded that \"to Jonathan Mayhew belongs the distinction of being the first of the Revolutionary preacher-patriots,\"\u009d was the influence of his Discourse. He even demonstrated substantial parallels between it and the Declaration of Independence.\n\nMayhew said \"having learned from the Holy Scriptures that wise, brave and virtuous men were always friends to liberty...made me conclude that freedom was a great blessing.\" Today, we need to remember how great is the blessing of freedom that has been passed down to us from his generation, and rekindle the same level of commitment to it, for freedom is always under fire."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/mayhew.foster/2062361", "page_content": "Mayhew Foster\n\nlieutenant Soldier\n\nOctober 9, 1911 (age 99) Richmond, Virginia, United States of America\n\nForeign his actions in World World War II, Foster was awarded both the Silver Star and the L\u00e9gion d\"Honneur. At the end of the war, G\u00f6ring surrendered to the Allied Powers in the Bavarian Alps. On May 9, 1945, Foster transported G\u00f6ring back to Germany on a 55-minute flight in an unescorted, unarmed L-5, a larger plane than the L4 he normally piloted, because G\u00f6ring weighed more than 300 pounds (140 kg). . Several times I had the impulse to turn the plane over and see if I could shake him out, but he was wedged in like a champagne cork.\" Foster said that G\u00f6ring, who spoke some English, avoided any talk of Adolf Hitler, with whom G\u00f6ring - as the commander of the Luftwaffe - had fallen out of favor as the total German defeat neared. \"He acted as though he was going on a sightseeing tour, or really as though I was going on a sightseeing tour, and he was showing me where he grew up. I had a.45 in a shoulder holster, but he couldn\"t reach that. But neither could I, because I had two hands controlling the plane.\" Foster further recalled G\u00f6ring as having been sharp, friendly, and witty, having joked when Foster asked him when Germany began manufacturing jets. \"Too late,\" G\u00f6ring was said to have answered. Foster continued: \"I could see that he was like one of our officers if he\"d been picked up. I wouldn\"t say it changed my view of the war, but it showed me that there are..

By October 1945, Foster was back in the United States, having flown seventy reconnaissance combat missions during his wartime service. He returned to his adopted home state of Montana, where he was appointed lieutenant colonel in the Montana Army National Guard.

Three members of the Nation of Islam \u2014the religious group to which he had once belonged\u2014were convicted of his murder. (Two were exonerated in 2021.) Prior to this, hostilities between Malcolm and the Nation of Islam had been mounting, the former having begun to receive death threats from the latter.\n\nMalcolm X\u2019s ideas were often at odds with the message of the civil rights movement . Martin Luther King, Jr. , for example, expounded nonviolent strategies such as civil disobedience and boycotting to achieve integration, while Malcolm advocated for armed self-defense and repudiated the message of integration as servile. But Malcolm X\u2019s philosophy evolved. He pressed the Nation of Islam to involve itself more in the civil rights movement during his final years in the organization. He also renounced his previously held separatist views after converting to orthodox Islam, and he expressed a desire near the end of his life to work more closely with the civil rights movement.\n\nAfter hearing about the Nation of Islam from his brother, who was already a member, Malcolm converted to the religion while serving prison time for burglary charges. Born in 20th-century America, the Nation combines elements from Black nationalism and traditional Islam. Malcolm X parted ways from the organization in 1964 and undertook the hajj \u2014the traditional Islamic pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca. It was then that he adopted Sunni Islam , along with the name el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz.\n\nMalcolm X was born in 1925 as Malcolm Little. His father was killed while Malcolm was still very young, possibly by white supremacists . His mother was institutionalized for mental health issues, and the children of the family were dispersed among foster homes or the homes of relatives. Though an excellent student, Malcolm dropped out of school in the eighth grade because of the racial discrimination he faced from teachers. He was incarcerated in 1946 on charges of burglary. His time in prison would be an inflection point for the philosophical and political trajectory of his life.\n\nMalcolm X was one of the most significant figures within the American Black nationalist movement. Many of the ideas he articulated, like race pride and self-defense, became ideological mainstays of the Black Power movement that emerged in the 1960s and \u201970s. He first rose to prominence in the late 1940s, as a member of the Nation of Islam , a religious organization that mixes elements of traditional Islam and Black nationalism. He continued his activism after leaving the Nation. His iconic status, if not solidified during his lifetime, was certainly achieved shortly after his death with the publication of the acclaimed The Autobiography of Malcolm X .\n\nEarly years and conversion to Islam\n\nDiscover the life of Malcolm X role and his role in the Civil Rights Movement See all videos for this article\n\nBorn in Nebraska, while an infant Malcolm moved with his family to Lansing, Michigan. When Malcolm was six years old, his father, the Rev. Earl Little, a Baptist minister and former supporter of the early Black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey, died after being hit by a streetcar, quite possibly the victim of murder by whites. The surviving family was so poor that Malcolm\u2019s mother, Louise Little, resorted to cooking dandelion greens from the street to feed her children. After she was committed to an insane asylum in 1939, Malcolm and his siblings were sent to foster homes or to live with family members.\n\nMalcolm excelled in school, but after one of his eighth-grade teachers told him that he should become a carpenter instead of a lawyer, he lost interest and soon ended his formal education. As a rebellious youngster, Malcolm moved from the Michigan State Detention Home, a juvenile home in Mason, Michigan, to the Roxbury section of Boston to live with an older half sister, Ella, from his father\u2019s first marriage. There he became involved in petty criminal activities in his teenage years. Known as \u201cDetroit Red\u201d for the reddish tinge in his hair, he developed into a street hustler, drug dealer, and leader of a gang of thieves in Roxbury and Harlem (in New York City).\n\nWhile in prison for robbery from 1946 to 1952, he underwent a conversion that eventually led him to join the Nation of Islam, an African American movement that combined elements of Islam with Black nationalism. His decision to join the Nation also was influenced by discussions with his brother Reginald, who had become a member in Detroit and who was incarcerated with Malcolm in the Norfolk Prison Colony in Massachusetts in 1948. Malcolm quit smoking and gambling and refused to eat pork in keeping with the Nation\u2019s dietary restrictions. In order to educate himself, he spent long hours reading books in the prison library, even memorizing a dictionary. He also sharpened his forensic skills by participating in debate classes. Following Nation tradition, he replaced his surname, \u201cLittle,\u201d with an \u201cX,\u201d a custom among Nation of Islam followers who considered their family names to have originated with white slaveholders."}]}
