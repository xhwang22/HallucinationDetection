Born in New Jersey, Lewis and a friend, Lucius Allen, traveled across the continent in 1851 to open a dry goods and grocery store in what was then a frontier town of about 800 people living along the west bank of the Willamette River. By 1880, their firm, Allen & Lewis, had become one of the leading wholesale grocery companies on the West Coast.\n\nSupporting transportation projects that affected his business, he was a member of the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee in the 1860s, invested in the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company in the 1870s, and was appointed to the original Port of Portland Commission in the 1890s. He helped form a local subscription library in the 1860s, and he was named to the city's first water board in the 1880s.\n\nMarried to Clementine Couch, daughter of another prominent Portland pioneer, Lewis fathered 11 children and after 1881 lived in a large, elegantly furnished house within walking distance of his office.

Gli uomini di stato devono essere disinteressati Transcription\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in 1826 in Cranbury, New Jersey, Lewis moved with his parents at age 13 to Newburgh, New York. At age 20, he went to New York City to work in the dry-goods business of Chambers, Heiser & Company.[1]\n\nMerchant-entrepreneur\n\nJohn DeWitt, a New York merchant, hired Lewis in 1851 to assist DeWitt's son-in-law, Lucius Allen, in running a wholesale supply house in Portland, a frontier settlement on the West Coast.[2] Portland, with a population of about 800, was in good position to trade via the Willamette and Columbia rivers and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and other ports and by land with an increasing number of pioneer farmers in the Willamette Valley.[3] Allen, a friend of Lewis, had tried and failed in 1850 to establish a Portland branch store, and DeWitt thought that the more experienced Lewis would be able to help. In 1883 after several setbacks, the two men opened their own business (independent of New York) in a rented store at Front and \"B\" (Burnside) streets. They specialized in dry goods and groceries, building customer loyalty by selling at a fixed price, extending credit to reliable customers, and offering free space in their safe for storage of their customers' gold.[2]\n\nBy 1860, Allen had moved to San Francisco, a seaport city about 600 miles (970 km) south of Portland, where the company bought most of its supplies. He became a silent partner, uninvolved in day-to-day management. By then the firm of Allen & Lewis had begun to focus on wholesale markets, and by 1880, it was one of the leading wholesale grocery firms on the West Coast.[2] Lewis and three contemporaries, Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, and Henry Failing, who arrived in Portland in 1851 and set up businesses along Front Street,[4] became \"merchant princes of the Northwest\".[5]\n\nWithin 10 years, this group of dedicated Front Street merchants and their families would dominate the economic, political and social life of Portland. All became warm and lasting friends with Ladd, the former teacher and railroad agent, first among equals... With Benjamin Stark and John H. Couch, who became Lewis's father-in-law, they formed Portland's earliest Establishment, one of merchant-entrepreneurs.[4]\n\nIn 1864, these four merchants and others formed the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee, to raise money to make the Willamette shipping channel more easily navigable. This led to a federally funded project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dredged the channel in 1866.[6] In 1891, Lewis was named to the original Port of Portland Commission, established by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to oversee the maritime commercial and shipping interests of the city.[7]\n\nWhen railroads began replacing steamships as a shipping method in the 1870s, Lewis, Ladd, Corbett, Failing, and Simeon Reed (a Portland transportation executive), became the five largest stockholders, aside from Henry Villard, in Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N).[8] In 1888, Lewis was part of a group that visited Villard in New York to negotiate favorable shipping rates on the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads, with which Villard and the OR&N had contracts affecting Portland.[9] Lewis's interest in Portland railroads extended to the Portland & Willamette Valley Railroad, of which he became a local director in 1885, and which was controlled and formally taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1890.[10]\n\nLewis and the other three pioneer merchants were among those in 1864 who formed the Mercantile Library Association (later renamed the Library Association of Portland) to establish a local subscription library. Roughly 30 years later, after a public library opened in Portland in 1891, members of the Cicero Lewis family were among its largest donors.[11] In 1885, Lewis was one of 15 men named to the Portland Water Committee, empowered by the state legislature to acquire and operate a municipal water system for the city.[12]\n\nFamily, other interests, death\n\nIn 1857 Lewis married Clementine Couch, daughter of John H. Couch, a sea captain and early Portland settler. Unlike many of his friends, Lewis developed few interests beyond his business. His only form of recreation was walking to work, and although he was a charter member of the Arlington Club and could have dined there, he usually walked home for lunch. Historian E. Kimbark MacColl writes that Lewis \"spent his life at his desk and never went out in the evening for entertainment or the theater... He was never known to have taken a pleasure trip, spending what remaining leisure time he had with his wife and 11 children.\"[13] Lewis died of a stroke in 1897 while walking back to work on a Saturday afternoon.[13]\n\nLewis was a member of the Episcopal Church[14] and a Mason.[15] He was one of the largest supporters of Good Samaritan Hospital and Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland.[13] After Lewis died, his wife funded a hospital addition named in his honor at Good Samaritan.[1]\n\nThe Lewis family lived in a house on Fourth and Everett streets until 1881, when they built a large house on a lot in the Couch tract in northwest Portland. The tract, consisting of half of the block between 19th and 20th streets and Everett and Flanders streets, was owned by Mary Couch, Clementine's sister, and was developed by other members of the Couch family.[n 1] The project consisted of four houses, each on a lot 100 feet (30 m) wide and 100 feet (30 m) long.[5] The Lewis property, facing 19th Street, included stables, a greenhouse, and a sweeping drive leading to a carriage porch. Their very large house was built in a stick style that was \"rather simple for its period\", but its interior featured tall windows, a massive staircase, front and rear parlors, a reception room with a marble fireplace, and tall mirrors in elaborate frames, as well as \"rare woods, marble mantels, brocaded walls [and] fine lighting fixtures\" throughout.[5] The four houses on the Couch tract were demolished in the 1960s.[5]\n\nNotes and references\n\nNotes\n\n^ avenues in the 21st century) are numbered in ascending order beginning west of Front Street (later named [16] Central Portland lies on the west side of a bend in the north-flowing Willamette River .

His father, Cicero Hunt Lewis, Sr., arrived in Portland in 1851, when it was little more than a hamlet. Cicero married Clementine F. Couch, daughter of another early mercantile family, on 01/18/1857. During the 1850s and 1860s, the Couch and Lewis Families grew dramatically in size and wealth. In 1870, when David was three, his immediate family had six brothers and sisters and three domestic servants. The US Census of 1870 recorded that Cicero, controlled real estate worth $15,000 and had $10,000 in his personal estate. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation Year: 1870; Census Place: Portland, Multnomah, Oregon; Roll: M593_1287; Page: 192A; Image: 152458; Family History Library Film: 552786, accessed 05/30/2017.) By the late 1870s, David would have ten siblings.\n\nDavid left Portland to attend Princeton University and Columbia University for undergraduate and graduate study, respectively. Between stints in school, Lewis returned to Portland c. 1890 to work; he visited Europe after Columbia, and then resettled in Portland. In 1900, he lived with his mother, six siblings and one sister-in-law at 125 19th Street in Portland, OR. This must have been a capacious mansion able to board that many family members and six servants including three household staff, two gardeners and a coachman.

His Portland address was 285 21st Street, where he lived with his wife and two maids.

His death certificate listed his place of residence as 285 North 21st Street in Portland, OR, and it indicated that Lewis had lived in the California Sanitorium for four months before his death. (The Portland, Oregon, City Directory, 1917, [p. 695] also listed his permanent address as 285 North 21st Street.) He was laid to rest in Riverview Cemetery in Portland, CA.\n\nParents\n\nHis father was Cicero Horatius Lewis, (born 1826 in Cranbury, NJ-d. 01/04/1897), who worked in 1880 as a wholesale grocer and was a prominent benefactor of the local Episcopalian church. His maternal grandfather was the early Portland, OR, businessman, Captain John Heard Couch (1811-1870), his maternal grandmother, Caroline E. Flanders Couch. His mother was Clementine Freeman Couch (born 10/1838 in Newburyport, MA-d. 1914), who had 11 children, all of whom survived into adulthood. David had a brother, Lucius Allen Lewis (1863-1935), for whom he designed a residence in 1901. Other siblings were: Mary Emma Lewis Bingham (1857-1944), John Couch Lewis (1859-1939), Elizabeth Lewis Good (1863-1928), Evelyn Scott Lewis Mills (1865-1936), Sarah Heard Lewis (01/1870-1964), Robert W.

(See Ancestry.com, Source Citation Oregon State Library; Salem, Oregon; Oregon Marriage Indexes, 1906-2006; Reel: 1, accessed 05/30/2017.) her parents were William Honeyman (1840-1899) and Jane C. Dawson. They married 01/27/1864.\n\nShe subsequently married Jordan V. Zan (1876-1966).

When Octavian and Antony reconciled, a centurion murdered Cicero on Antony\u2019s order. Cicero\u2019s head and hands were nailed to the rostra in the Roman Forum.\n\nIn his youth, Marcus Tullius Cicero was instructed by the famed rhetorician Molon of Rhodes. Molon did not stick to any one style, instead drifting between florid and concise language. Cicero perfected this methodology, relying on cadence, emotion, and the energy of his audience and interweaving references to literature, philosophy, and history.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero resented the political machinations of Julius Caesar , Pompey , and Marcus Licinius Crassus and initially refused to ally himself with them, even attempting to isolate Pompey from Caesar. However, he later committed himself publicly\u2014if not personally\u2014to their advancement before diminishing his political involvement during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.\n\nIn 63 BCE Marcus Tullius Cicero gave an impassioned oration to his fellow senators that charged Catiline with plotting to stage a violent coup. This so moved the Senate that they voted to implement martial law and execute the conspirators. Cicero was named pater patriae\u2014\u201cfather of the country\u201d\u2014for his service to the republic.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was a masterful orator known for his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in plebeians and patricians alike. Cicero\u2019s political career saw him as quaestor , praetor , consul , and proconsul , providing him with several opportunities to influence the trajectory of Rome and the Senate in the waning days of the republic.\n\nCicero , in full Marcus Tullius Cicero , (born 106 bce, Arpinum, Latium [now Arpino, Italy]\u2014died December 7, 43 bce, Formiae , Latium [now Formia]), Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who vainly tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic . His writings include books of rhetoric , orations, philosophical and political treatises , and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator and the innovator of what became known as Ciceronian rhetoric.\n\nIn the first of his consular speeches, he opposed the agrarian bill of Servilius Rullus, in the interest of the absent Pompey; but his chief concern was to discover and make public the seditious intentions of Catiline, who, defeated in 64, appeared again at the consular elections in 63 (over which Cicero presided, wearing armour beneath his toga). Catiline lost and planned to carry out armed uprisings in Italy and arson in Rome. Cicero had difficulty in persuading the Senate of the danger, but the \u201clast decree\u201d (Senatus consultum ultimum), something like a proclamation of martial law , was passed on October 22. On November 8, after escaping an attempt on his life, Cicero delivered the first speech against Catiline in the Senate, and Catiline left Rome that night. Evidence incriminating the conspirators was secured and, after a senatorial debate in which Cato the Younger spoke for execution and Julius Caesar against, they were executed on Cicero\u2019s responsibility. Cicero, announcing their death to the crowd with the single word vixerunt (\u201cthey are dead\u201d), received a tremendous ovation from all classes, which inspired his subsequent appeal in politics to concordia ordinum, \u201cconcord between the classes.\u201d He was hailed by Catulus as \u201cfather of his country.\u201d This was the climax of his career.\n\nCicero was the son of a wealthy family of Arpinum . Admirably educated in Rome and in Greece , he did military service in 89 under Pompeius Strabo (the father of the statesman and general Pompey ) and made his first appearance in the courts defending Publius Quinctius in 81. His brilliant defense, in 80 or early 79, of Sextus Roscius against a fabricated charge of parricide established his reputation at the bar, and he started his public career as quaestor (an office of financial administration) in western Sicily in 75.\n\nAlliance with the First Triumvirate\n\nAt the end of 60, Cicero declined Caesar\u2019s invitation to join the political alliance of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey, the so-called First Triumvirate, which he considered unconstitutional, and also Caesar\u2019s offer in 59 of a place on his staff in Gaul. When Publius Clodius, whom Cicero had antagonized by speaking and giving evidence against him when he was tried for profanity early in 61, became tribune in 58, Cicero was in danger, and in March, disappointed by Pompey\u2019s refusal to help him, he fled Rome. On the following day Clodius carried a bill forbidding the execution of a Roman citizen without trial. Clodius then carried through a second law, of doubtful legality, declaring Cicero an exile. Cicero went first to Thessalonica, in Macedonia, and then to Illyricum. In 57, thanks to the activity of Pompey and particularly the tribune Titus Annius Milo, he was recalled on August 4. Cicero landed at Brundisium (Brindisi) on that day and was acclaimed all along his route to Rome, where he arrived a month later.\n\nIn winter 57\u201356 Cicero attempted unsuccessfully to estrange Pompey from Caesar. Pompey disregarded Cicero\u2019s advice and renewed his compact with Caesar and Crassus at Luca in April 56. Cicero then agreed, under pressure from Pompey, to align himself with the three in politics, and he committed himself in writing to this effect (the \u201cpalinode\u201d). The speech De provinciis consularibus (On the Consular Provinces) marked his new alliance. He was obliged to accept a number of distasteful defenses, and he abandoned public life. In the next few years he completed the De oratore (55; On the Orator) and De republica (52; On the Republic) and began the De legibus (52; On Laws). In 52 he was delighted when Milo killed Clodius but failed disastrously in his defense of Milo (later written for publication, the Pro Milone, or For Milo).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The province had been expecting a Parthian invasion, but it never materialized, although Cicero did suppress some brigands on Mt. Amanus. The Senate granted a supplicatio (a period of public thanksgiving), although Cicero had hoped for a triumph, a processional return through the city, on his return to Rome. All admitted that he governed Cilicia with integrity.\n\nBy the time Cicero returned to Rome, Pompey and Caesar were struggling against each other for complete power. He was on the outskirts of Rome when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy in January 49. Cicero met Pompey outside Rome on January 17 and accepted a commission to supervise recruiting in Campania. He did not leave Italy with Pompey on March 17, however. His indecision was not discreditable, though his criticism of Pompey\u2019s strategy was inexpert. In an interview with Caesar on March 28, Cicero showed great courage in stating his own terms\u2014his intention of proposing in the Senate that Caesar should not pursue the war against Pompey any further\u2014though they were terms that Caesar could not possibly accept. Cicero disapproved of Caesar\u2019s dictatorship; yet he realized that in the succession of battles (which continued until 45) he would have been one of the first victims of Caesar\u2019s enemies, had they triumphed. This was his second period of intensive literary production, works of this period including the Brutus, Paradoxa Stoicorum (Paradoxes of the Stoics), and Orator (The Orator) in 46; De finibus (On the Supreme Good) in 45; and Tusculanae disputationes (Tusculan Disputations), De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), and De officiis (On Duties), finished after Caesar\u2019s murder, in 44."}], "Cicero Hunt Lewis practiced law in New York City.": [{"url": "https://everything.explained.today/Cicero_Hunt_Lewis/", "page_content": "Cicero Hunt Lewis Explained\n\nCicero Hunt Lewis Birth Date: December 22, 1826 Birth Place: Cranbury, New Jersey, United States Death Date: January 5, 1897 Death Place: Portland, Oregon, United States Nationality: American Occupation: Merchant, investor Spouse: Clementine Couch Children: 11 Relations: John H. Couch, father-in-law\n\nCicero Hunt Lewis (1826\u20131897) was a prominent merchant and investor in Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon during the second half of the 19th century. Born in New Jersey, Lewis and a friend, Lucius Allen, traveled across the continent in 1851 to open a dry goods and grocery store in what was then a frontier town of about 800 people living along the west bank of the Willamette River. By 1880, their firm, Allen & Lewis, had become one of the leading wholesale grocery companies on the West Coast.\n\nSupporting transportation projects that affected his business, he was a member of the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee in the 1860s, invested in the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company in the 1870s, and was appointed to the original Port of Portland Commission in the 1890s. He helped form a local subscription library in the 1860s, and he was named to the city's first water board in the 1880s.\n\nMarried to Clementine Couch, daughter of another prominent Portland pioneer, Lewis fathered 11 children and after 1881 lived in a large, elegantly furnished house within walking distance of his office. He spent most of his time at work or at home, and had few other interests aside from church and charitable donations. He died in 1897 while walking to work on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in 1826 in Cranbury, New Jersey, Lewis moved with his parents at age 13 to Newburgh, New York. At age 20, he went to New York City to work in the dry-goods business of Chambers, Heiser & Company.[1]\n\nMerchant-entrepreneur\n\nJohn DeWitt, a New York merchant, hired Lewis in 1851 to assist DeWitt's son-in-law, Lucius Allen, in running a wholesale supply house in Portland, a frontier settlement on the West Coast.[2] Portland, with a population of about 800, was in good position to trade via the Willamette and Columbia rivers and the Pacific Ocean with San Francisco and other ports and by land with an increasing number of pioneer farmers in the Willamette Valley.[3] Allen, a friend of Lewis, had tried and failed in 1850 to establish a Portland branch store, and DeWitt thought that the more experienced Lewis would be able to help. In 1883 after several setbacks, the two men opened their own business (independent of New York) in a rented store at Front and \"B\" (Burnside) streets. They specialized in dry goods and groceries, building customer loyalty by selling at a fixed price, extending credit to reliable customers, and offering free space in their safe for storage of their customers' gold.[2]\n\nBy 1860, Allen had moved to San Francisco, a seaport city about 600miles south of Portland, where the company bought most of its supplies. He became a silent partner, uninvolved in day-to-day management. By then the firm of Allen & Lewis had begun to focus on wholesale markets, and by 1880, it was one of the leading wholesale grocery firms on the West Coast.[2] Lewis and three contemporaries, Henry W. Corbett, William S. Ladd, and Henry Failing, who arrived in Portland in 1851 and set up businesses along Front Street,[4] became \"merchant princes of the Northwest\".\n\nWithin 10 years, this group of dedicated Front Street merchants and their families would dominate the economic, political and social life of Portland. All became warm and lasting friends with Ladd, the former teacher and railroad agent, first among equals... With Benjamin Stark and John H. Couch, who became Lewis's father-in-law, they formed Portland's earliest Establishment, one of merchant-entrepreneurs.[4]\n\nIn 1864, these four merchants and others formed the Portland River Channel Improvement Committee, to raise money to make the Willamette shipping channel more easily navigable. This led to a federally funded project by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which dredged the channel in 1866.[5] In 1891, Lewis was named to the original Port of Portland Commission, established by the Oregon Legislative Assembly to oversee the maritime commercial and shipping interests of the city.[6]\n\nWhen railroads began replacing steamships as a shipping method in the 1870s, Lewis, Ladd, Corbett, Failing, and Simeon Reed (a Portland transportation executive), became the five largest stockholders, aside from Henry Villard, in Villard's Oregon Railway and Navigation Company (OR&N).[7] In 1888, Lewis was part of a group that visited Villard in New York to negotiate favorable shipping rates on the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads, with which Villard and the OR&N had contracts affecting Portland.[8] Lewis's interest in Portland railroads extended to the Portland & Willamette Valley Railroad, of which he became a local director in 1885, and which was controlled and formally taken over by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1890.[9]\n\nLewis and the other three pioneer merchants were among those in 1864 who formed the Mercantile Library Association (later renamed the Library Association of Portland) to establish a local subscription library. Roughly 30 years later, after a public library opened in Portland in 1891, members of the Cicero Lewis family were among its largest donors.[10] In 1885, Lewis was one of 15 men named to the Portland Water Committee, empowered by the state legislature to acquire and operate a municipal water system for the city.[11]\n\nFamily, other interests, death\n\nIn 1857 Lewis married Clementine Couch, daughter of John H. Couch, a sea captain and early Portland settler. Unlike many of his friends, Lewis developed few interests beyond his business. His only form of recreation was walking to work, and although he was a charter member of the Arlington Club and could have dined there, he usually walked home for lunch. Historian E. Kimbark MacColl writes that Lewis \"spent his life at his desk and never went out in the evening for entertainment or the theater... He was never known to have taken a pleasure trip, spending what remaining leisure time he had with his wife and 11 children.\"[12] Lewis died of a stroke in 1897 while walking back to work on a Saturday afternoon.[12]\n\nLewis was a member of the Episcopal Church[13] and a Mason.[14] He was one of the largest supporters of Good Samaritan Hospital and Trinity Episcopal Church in Portland.[12] After Lewis died, his wife funded a hospital addition named in his honor at Good Samaritan.[1]\n\nThe Lewis family lived in a house on Fourth and Everett streets until 1881, when they built a large house on a lot in the Couch tract in northwest Portland. The tract, consisting of half of the block between 19th and 20th streets and Everett and Flanders streets, was owned by Mary Couch, Clementine's sister, and was developed by other members of the Couch family. The project consisted of four houses, each on a lot 100feet wide and 100feet long.[15] The Lewis property, facing 19th Street, included stables, a greenhouse, and a sweeping drive leading to a carriage porch. Their very large house was built in a stick style that was \"rather simple for its period\", but its interior featured tall windows, a massive staircase, front and rear parlors, a reception room with a marble fireplace, and tall mirrors in elaborate frames, as well as \"rare woods, marble mantels, brocaded walls [and] fine lighting fixtures\" throughout.[15] The four houses on the Couch tract were demolished in the 1960s.[15]\n\nNotes and references\n\nNotesReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\nGaston, Joseph (1911).

She begins her latest work by explaining how a specialist in Late Antiquity was drawn into the study of law in the late Republic. In the Later Empire, she writes, law was indissolubly connected to rhetoric. The issuing of law by the emperors was at least as much a means of self-representation as it was a means to bring justice to their subjects. But law was not just oratory \u2014 what about the role of the jurists and of jurisprudence? The answer to this question has led H. to Cicero and the late Republic.\n\nH. pursues two main lines of investigation. In the one, she analyzes Cicero\u2019s ideas about the law and the role of the jurists. Throughout much of his life, Cicero, an orator and advocate rather than a jurist, saw jurisprudence as of less value to the state than philosophy or rhetoric. It was only during his last years, when Rome had been wracked by anarchy and civil war, that Cicero recognized the importance of small-time justice and the value of the jurists\u2019 efforts to make justice work. Her other line of investigation explores the history of the ius civile and the development of jurisprudence. The main thesis is that jurisprudence tended to become a specialized field, but that its practitioners were not isolated from society. H. adheres to Kunkel\u2019s view that in the second century BC jurisprudence was in the hands of individuals who belonged to the highest classes at Rome, but that in the final decades of the Republic the social status and political independence of the jurists declined.\n\nChapter I concentrates on the eminent jurist and pontifex maximus Q. Mucius Scaevola, who was killed in 82 BC at the instigation of Marius the Younger while trying to maintain his neutrality. Cicero\u2019s appraisal of Mucius Scaevola is seen by H. as reflecting his attitude towards jurisprudence. As governor of Cilicia Cicero abided by the ruling of Scaevola\u2019s provincial edict that allowed provincials to resolve their disputes in accordance with their own laws. However, we should not read too much into this. Taking a closer look at Cicero, Att. 6.1.15, we see that he adheres to the rulings of the urban praetor and Scaevola out of pragmatism. The Greeks are happy to have Greek judges, Cicero says, and who cares if these are a long-winded lot, as long as the Greeks think they have gained autonomia ? So much for Cicero\u2019s principles! In his de Officiis, written in the autumn of 44 BC, Cicero again refers to Scaevola, this time regarding the latter\u2019s emphasis on bona fides as a fundamental element of Roman law. Likewise, Cicero thinks that the law is based on the consent of the citizenry. H. argues that Scaevola\u2019s prominence in Cicero\u2019s final writings reflects the latter\u2019s acknowledgement of the value of jurisprudence.\n\nWhile H. focuses on Cicero\u2019s political and philosophical writings, his letters may shed a different light on these matters. The Epistulae ad Familiares yield only one casual reference to Mucius Scaevola the Pontifex (1.10.26, 54 BC). More interesting are the three references in the letters to Atticus: in February 49, when Cicero mulled over the difficult question whether or not to stay in Italy, he liked to see himself as following the example of Mucius Scaevola, who had faced his opponents in Rome ( Att. 8.3.6). In two subsequent letters, written one month later, he refers to the fate of Mucius ( Att. 9.13.1, 17.2). In his letters it was only in the aftermath of Caesar\u2019s invasion of Italy that Cicero thought of Mucius Scaevola the Pontifex, and not as a jurist but as a martyr in the cause of Liberty.\n\nChapter II argues that a false tradition emerged in the late Republic and imperial times concerning the history of jurisprudence. In order to strengthen its position, Mucius Scaevola emphasized the relationship between the ius civile and the illustrious XII Tables. The early jurists were members of the elite, whose interest in the law stemmed from their involvement with the law in other functions. For example, the legal work of Manilius ( cos. 149 BC) on the trade in livestock was based on his position as landowner. The jurists derived their authority not solely from their legal expertise. However, the social standing and independence of the jurists declined in the first century BC. In his pro Murena, Cicero ridiculed jurisprudence as an endless debate by second-rate would-be politicians. Pomponius reflects the false perspective of the second century AD, according to which the history of Roman jurisprudence had been one of separate schools of prominent jurists.\n\nCicero defines the ius civile by its sources, among which he includes custom ( mos) and justice ( aequitas), which obviously increased the ambiguity of legal definitions (Chapter III). Cicero saw the law as based in human reason, which means that the \u2018Law\u2019 was not identical with official laws. H. observes that Cicero\u2019s own experiences shaped his view of the law. In Cicero\u2019s eyes law was defined by what was just, not by legal formalities. Hence, Cicero rejected Clodius\u2019 law by which he was banished from Rome as unlawful. At the same time, he regarded some threats to the res publica as sufficiently grave to allow actions in conflict with the formalities of the law. His own execution of the Catilinarians is a case in point.\n\nChapter IV returns to the social position of the jurists. H. notes that, despite the reduced status of its practitioners, jurisprudence flourished in the late Republic. H. could have discussed similar developments in other segments of society. Most importantly, we see a similar change in the officer corps of the Roman army, which in the second century BC was largely manned by the young scions of the Roman nobility, whose further careers involved them in many different private and public functions. In Cicero\u2019s age, however, many officers derived from the Italian upper classes. As clients of the Roman magnates they made a career as military professionals. Hence Pompey, Caesar, and Octavian could rely on the services not only of jurists among their staffs, but also of professional soldiers who came from a similar social background. This development does not reflect the decline in status of the Roman army, nor does it regarding jurisprudence.\n\nH. continues with Cicero\u2019s charges against the jurist Servius Sulpicius Rufus in pro Murena. H. shows that we have little idea of the social position and outlook of the jurists of this period. Their writings remain solely in the form of quotations by later jurists and antiquarians which mainly reflect the interests of these later writers rather than those of the original authors. Chapter V shows that there is actually little support for the often held assumption that the jurists\u2019 arguments were of a different nature from those of advocates and orators.\n\nChapter VI returns to the social position of such jurists as Trebatius Testa and Servius. Cicero provides us with detailed information concerning the activities and attitudes of the latter, who was as much an orator, historian, magistrate and diplomat as he was a jurist. As H. notes, nobody would have guessed this on the basis of Pomponius or the other juristic sources. Trebatius, on the other hand, owed his career under Caesar solely to his legal expertise. H. suggests that the need for systemization and elucidation of Roman law was increased after the expansion of Roman citizen status to the former Italian allies. However, she fails to offer any support for this view, except for the possibly similar upsurge in legal writing in response to the Constitutio Antoniniana. (In the latter case the question remains how much impact the Latin writings of, say, Ulpian had on the courts of the Greek East.)\n\nIn early Roman law the primary task of the judges was to mediate. It remained a characteristic feature of Roman law that judges were given much leeway in their treatment of cases. Precedents could not restrict their decisions in any way, and Roman law did not develop along the lines of, for instance, American law. Parallel cases were of importance to jurists in order to distill general legal principles from them, while advocates were interested in the rhetoric employed in previous lawsuits (Chapter VII).\n\nIn chapter VIII H. discusses the relationship between the ius civile and other forms of Roman law. There are no clear definitions, and in part they overlap. Modern scholars should not limit themselves to the ius civile and the jurists, she says, but should also take into account the pontiffs and augurs. The priests and the antiquarians also engaged in the interpretation of ancient laws (Chapter IX). When later authors created the history of the ius civile, they did so in the light of their ideas about the development of the Roman state. The development of the ius civile was thus connected to the Struggle of the Orders and to the abolishment of the patrician and priestly monopolies within the state. The story about the creation of the XII Tables has a place in this fictive tradition, as well as that about the scribe Flavius.\n\nThe function of the law is to protect the community from the wicked. By their very nature, the wicked cannot be part of the community. Therefore they do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as citizens. The civil strife of the late Republic is seen by Cicero as a struggle between the good citizens, and individual outlaws such as Catiline, Caesar, and Marc Antony, who are solely driven by their own dignitas. Those in power may abuse the law, but their legal rulings never become true law if not with the consent of the good citizens (Chapter X). During the final stage of his life and career, Cicero was driven by the urge to expose the unlawful nature of Caesar\u2019s and Marc Antony\u2019s regime (Chapter XI). His Philippics try to destroy the reputation of Marc Antony and depict him as a villain who has lost any claim to citizen status. Because he threatened the res publica, any means were allowed to overcome him. For this reason Cicero welcomed the murder of Caesar. Cicero\u2019s letters to Cassius ( ad Fam. 12.3.1, 4.1) make clear that he regretted just one thing about the Ides of March: the murderers of Caesar should not have left Marc Antony alive. Interestingly, on occasion Atticus and Brutus expressed their disagreement with Cicero\u2019s radicalism. (Cf. A. Lintott, Violence in republican Rome, Oxford 1999 [2nd edn.], pp. 64f.)\n\nH.\u2019s book is important because it analyses Roman law as shaped by the forces of politics and society. She encourages us not to be deceived by the nature and limitations of our sources, and thus offers a new interpretation of the development of jurisprudence and the social position of its practitioners. However, the subject matter of this book is far from easy and straightforward, and H.\u2019s sometimes confused treatment does not make it any easier. It is often frustratingly unclear why certain topics are discussed and in the order that they are, and equally baffling is the repetition of certain topics, such as Scaevola\u2019s introduction of genera in jurisprudence, Cicero\u2019s pro Murena in chapters II and IV, methods of argumentation in IV and V, and the extensive discussion of the ius civile Flavianum in chapters II and IX.\n\nThere are some surprising omissions in the bibliography, such as Gelzer\u2019s authoritative biography of Cicero, C. Meier\u2019s Res publica amissa (Wiesbaden 1980, 2nd ed.), and W. Kunkel, Herkunft und soziale Stellung der r\u00f6mischen Juristen (Graz 1967, 2nd ed.).

In fact I do not think that those who were in charge of this service have been ignorant of universal law, but they have trained in what they call civil [law] only so far as they wanted to furnish this service to the people. Yet it is thin material for study although necessary in practice. So to what do you call me, or what are you urging on me?

For I see that that Plato of yours did so, at whom you marvel, whom you rank ahead of all, whom you greatly cherish.\n\n\n\nM: Then do you want this: as with Clinias the Cretan and Megillus the Spartan [fictional characters in Plato\u2019s Laws], as he describes, during a summer day in the cypress groves and woodland paths of Cnossos, often stopping, occasionally resting, he argues about the institutions of republics and about the best laws, so let us, walking among these very tall poplar trees on the green and shady bank and then lingering, seek something fuller concerning these same matters than forensic practice calls for?\n\n\n\n[16] A: Indeed I desire to hear those very things.\n\n\n\nM: What does Quintus say?\n\n\n\nQ: [There\u2019s] no subject [I want to hear about] more.\n\n\n\nM: And indeed rightly. For recognize that in no kind of arguing are more honorable things brought into the open: what nature has granted to man, what a number of the best things the human mind encompasses, what service we have been born and brought into light in order to perform and accomplish, what is the connection between men [and gods], and what natural fellowship there is among them. For when these things have been explained, the source of laws and right can be found.\n\n\n\n[17] A: So you don\u2019t think that the discipline of law should be drawn from the praetor\u2019s edict, as many do now, or from the Twelve Tables [archaic set of basic Roman laws], as earlier people did, but from within the profoundest philosophy?\n\n\n\nM: In fact, Pomponius, in this conversation we do not seek how to safeguard interests in law, or how to respond to each consultation. That very thing may be a great matter, and it is, which formerly was undertaken by many famous men and is now undertaken by one man of the highest authority and knowledge [Servius Sulpicius]. But in this debate we must embrace the entire cause of universal right and laws, so that what we call civil [law] may be confined to a kind of small, narrow place. For we must explain the nature of law, and this must be traced from human nature. We must consider laws by which states ought to be ruled; then we must treat these laws and orders of peoples that have been composed and delineated, in which indeed what are called the civil laws of our people will not be hidden.\n\n\n\n[18] Q: Truly, brother, you trace deeply and, as is proper, to the fountain head of what we are asking about. Those who pass on the civil law otherwise are passing on not so much ways of justice as ways of litigating.\n\n\n\nM: That is not so, Quintus; ignorance of the law is more litigious than knowledge of it. But this later; now let us see the beginnings of law.\n\n\n\nTherefore, it has pleased very learned men to commence with law\u2013probably rightly, if only, as the same men define it, law is highest reason, implanted in nature, which orders those things that ought to be done [and] prohibits the opposite. When the same reason has been strengthened and perfected in the human mind, it is law. [19] And so they think that law is prudence, the force of which is such as to order people to act rightly [and] forbid them to transgress. And they think this thing has been called [according to] the Greek name for granting to each his own, while I think it comes from our word for choosing. For as they put the force of fairness into law, we put the force of choice into it. And nevertheless each one is appropriate to law. But if it is thus rightly said, as indeed in general it usually seems to me, the beginning of right should be drawn from law. For this is a force of nature; this is the mind and reason of the prudent man; this is the rule of right and wrong. But since our entire speech is in the people\u2019s business, sometimes it will be necessary to speak popularly and to call that a law which, when written, consecrates what it wants by either ordering [or forbidding], as the crowd calls it. Indeed let us take the beginning of establishing right from that highest law, which was born, before any law was written, for generations in common [corrupt text here], or before a state was established at all.\n\n\n\n[20] Q: That is truly more convenient and suitable for the method of conversation we have begun.\n\n\n\nM: Then do you want us to trace the birth of right itself from its source? Once we have found it, there will be no doubt how to judge what we are seeking.\n\n\n\nQ: Truly I think it must so be done.\n\n\n\nA: Join me as well to your brother\u2019s sentiment.\n\n\n\nM: Since, then, we should maintain and preserve the form of the republic that Scipio taught to be the best in that book, and since all laws should be adapted to that kind of state, and since customs should be sown and not everything should be consecrated in writing, I will trace the root of right from nature, with which as our leader we should pursue the entire debate.\n\n\n\nA: Most rightly, and indeed with it as leader there will be no way to err.\n\n\n\n[21] M: Then, Pomponius, do you grant me this (for I know Quintus\u2019s sentiment): all nature is ruled by the immortal gods\u2019 force, nature, reason, power, mind, will, or whatever other word there is by which I may signify more plainly what I want? For if you do not approve this, I must begin my case from there before anything else.\n\n\n\nA: I grant it, to be sure, if you expect it. And indeed because of the harmony of the birds and the rumbling of the rivers I do not fear that any of my fellow-students [fellow Epicureans] will clearly hear.\n\n\n\nM: And yet beware: for they are accustomed to becoming totally angry, as good men are. Truly they will not bear it if they hear that you have betrayed the excellent man\u2019s first sentence, in which he wrote that god cares for nothing, either his own or another\u2019s.\n\n\n\n[22] A: Continue, I beg you. For I expect [to hear] how what I have admitted to you is relevant.\n\n\n\nM: I will not make you wait longer. For it is relevant at this point: this animal\u2013foreseeing, sagacious, manifold, sharp, mindful, filled with reason and judgment\u2013that we call man, has been begotten by the supreme god in a sort of magnificent condition. For it alone, of all the kinds and natures of animate beings, has a share in reason and reflection, in which all the others have no part. Moreover, what is more divine than reason\u2013I will not say in man but in the entire heaven and earth? When it has grown up and been perfected, it is rightly named wisdom. [23] Therefore, since nothing is better than reason, and since it [is] in both man and god, the primary fellowship of man with god involves reason. Moreover, among those who have reason in common, right reason is also in common; since that is law, we should also consider men to be united with gods by law. Furthermore, among those who have a sharing in law, there is a sharing in right. Moreover, for them these things are [missing text here] and they must be recognized as being of the same state\u2013indeed, if they obey the same commands and powers, even much more so. Moreover, they obey this celestial configuration and divine mind and very powerful god, so that now this whole universe should [be] thought to be one state in common between gods and men. And the fact that in states positions are distinguished by blood relations of families\u2013according to a sort of method that will be spoken of in a suitable place\u2013is all the more magnificent and excellent in the nature of things; thus men are held to be in the \u201cblood relation\u201d and \u201crace\u201d of the gods.\n\n\n\n[24] For [the things that] are usually argued when all of nature is inquired about are without doubt as they are argued: in the perpetual celestial courses [and] revolutions there emerged a sort of ripeness for sowing the human race; when it was scattered and sown over the earth, it was increased by the divine gift of souls. And although men have taken the other things of which they are composed from mortal stock and those things are fragile and frail, the soul has been implanted by god. From this, in truth, there is what can be recognized as a blood relation, or a family or a lineage, between us and the heavenly beings. And so out of so many species there is no animal besides man that has any notion of god; and among men themselves there is no nation either so tame or so wild that, although it is ignorant of what sort of god it ought to have, does not know that it should have one. [25] From this it follows that he recognizes god because he, so to speak, recollects whence he arose. Moreover, the same virtue is in man and god, and it is not in any other species besides; and virtue is nothing other than [nature] perfected and taken all the way to its highest point. There is, therefore, a natural similarity between man and god. Since this is so, what in the world can be a nearer, more definite kinship?\n\n\n\nAnd so nature has generously given so great a richness of things for human convenience and use that those things that are begotten seem to have been donated to us by resolution, not originated by chance\u2013not only those things that are poured out as the produce of the earth laden with crops and fruits, but also cattle, which it is clear have been procreated partly for human use, partly for enjoyment, partly for feeding on. [26] Indeed countless arts have been found by the teaching of nature, which reason imitated in order to attain skillfully the things necessary for life.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the same nature not only adorned man himself with swiftness of mind, but also allotted [him] the senses as escorts and messengers, as well as the obscure, insufficiently elucidated understandings of many things as, so to speak, a sort of foundation of knowledge. And it gave a shape to the body manageable and suitable to natural human abilities. For although it cast down the other animate beings for grazing, it raised up man alone and aroused him to a view of heaven as if heaven were his kin and original domicile. Then it shaped the appearance of his face so as to portray in it the character hidden within. [27] For the expressive eyes say beyond measure how we have been affected in the mind, and what is called the countenance, which can exist in no animate being besides man, indicates character; the Greeks know the significance of this, but they do not at all have a name for it. I leave out the fitness and the abilities of the rest of the body, the moderation of the voice, the force of speech, which is the greatest matchmaker of human fellowship (for not all things are for this debate and time, and Scipio expressed this point sufficiently, as it seems to me, in the book [On the Republic] you have read). Now since god [thus] begot and adorned man\u2013that is, he wanted him to have precedence over remaining things\u2013it is clear (so that not everything might be discussed) that nature itself proceeds farther by itself: even with no one teaching it, having commenced with those things the kinds of which it recognized from its first, unfinished understanding, it strengthens and perfects reason by itself.\n\n\n\n[28] A: Immortal gods, how you trace from afar the beginnings of right! And you do it in such a way that, not only am I not in a hurry to get to those matters I was expecting from you regarding civil law, but I readily [also] allow you to spend this day, even all of it, in this very conversation. For these things, which perhaps you include for the sake of other things, are more important than those very things for the sake of which these things are a preface.\n\n\n\nM: Indeed these are important things that are now briefly taken up. But of all the things involved in debate by men\u2019s teachers, surely nothing is preferable to its being plainly understood that we have been born for justice and that right has been established not by opinion but by nature. This will already be evident if you have examined the fellowship and connection of men among themselves.\n\n\n\n[29] For there is nothing so similar one-to-one, so equal, as all people are among ourselves. But if the perverting of habits and the vanity of opinions did not twist the weakness of minds and bend it in whatever direction it had begun, no one would be so similar to himself as all people would be to all people. And so whatever the definition of man is, one applies to all people. [30] This is enough of an argument that there is no dissimilarity within the species. If there were, no one definition would encompass all. And indeed reason, by which alone we excel the beasts, through which we are effective in drawing inferences, through which we bring forward proof, disprove, discuss, demonstrate something, make conclusions\u2013it certainly is in common, differing in education, while equal, to be sure, in the capacity to learn. For the same things are grasped by the senses of all people; and the things that move the senses move them in the same way in all people; and the things that are imprinted upon minds, about which I spoke before, the unfinished understandings, are imprinted similarly upon all people; and speech, the interpreter of the mind, differs in words but is congruent in sentiments. There is no one of any nation who, having found a leader, cannot arrive at virtue.\n\n\n\n[31] Not only in right actions but also in instances of depravity there is a remarkable similarity of the human race. For all people are captivated by pleasure, which, although it is an enticement to disgrace, has a sort of similarity to a natural good; for it delights through its frivolity and pleasantness. So as a result of an error of the mind it is received as if it were something salutary, and by a similar ignorance death is fled as if it were a dissolution of nature, life is sought after because it holds us in the state in which we were born, pain is regarded as among the greatest evils both because of its own roughness and because the ruin of our nature seems to follow; [32] and because of the similarity of honorableness and glory, those who have been honored seem blessed while those who are without glory seem wretched. Troubles, joys, desires, fears wander through the minds of all similarly; and if people have different opinions, it does not follow that for that reason those who worship dog and cat as gods are not tormented by the same superstition as other nations. Moreover, what nation does not cherish kindness, benevolence, or a soul that is grateful and mindful of a benefit [conferred]? What nation does not despise, does not hate the haughty, the nefarious, the cruel, the ungrateful? Since from these things it may be understood that the whole race of men has been united among themselves [is one]; and the final result is that consideration [knowledge] of living rightly makes people better. If you approve these things, I will continue to the remaining matters; but if you lack something, let us explain that first.\n\n\n\nA: Certainly nothing for us, if I may respond for both of us.\n\n\n\n[33] M: It follows [Next], then, that we have been made by nature to participate in right, one with another, and to share it among all people. And I want this to be understood in this entire debate when I say that [right] is from nature. But there is so great a corrupting of bad habit that it is as if the sparks given by nature are extinguished by the corrupting, and the opposite faults arise and are strengthened. But if whatever is according to nature were also according to judgment, men \u201cwould think that nothing human is alien to themselves\u201d (as the poet [Terence] states), and right would be cultivated fairly by all. To those to whom reason has been given by nature, right reason has also been given, and therefore law, which is right reason in ordering and forbidding; if law has been given so has right. And reason has been given to all people; therefore right has been given to all people. [text is missing] And Socrates rightly used to curse the person who first separated advantage from right, for he used to complain that this was the source of all disasters. [text is missing] For whence comes that Pythagorean saying?\n\n\n\n[A gap of uncertain length occurs in the manuscript.]\n\n\n\n[34] From this it is clearly seen that, when a wise man offers this goodwill, spread so wide and far, to someone endowed with equal virtue, what follows is something that seems incredible to certain people but is necessary: he cherishes himself no more than he does the other person. For what is there that differs when things are entirely equal? But if anything could differ only a little, the name of friendship would already have passed away. Its significance is such that as soon as someone prefers his having something [to another\u2019s having it], it does not exist.\n\n\n\nAll these things are provided as advance fortification for the rest of our conversation and debate, so that it can be more easily understood that right is based in nature. When I have said a very little bit about this, I will come to civil law, from which all of this speech originated.\n\n\n\nQ: In fact you need to say very little. For from what you have said, it indeed certainly seems to me\u2013[even if otherwise] to Atticus\u2013that right has arisen from nature.\n\n\n\n[35] A: Could it seem otherwise to me, since these things have already been fully developed: first, that we have been furnished and adorned as if by gifts of the gods; second, moreover, that there is one equal, common manner of living for men among themselves; then that all people are held together by a sort of natural indulgence and goodwill among themselves, as well as by a fellowship of right? Since we have admitted\u2013rightly, as I think\u2013that these things are true, how is it allowed for us to separate laws and rights from nature?\n\n\n\n[36] M: You speak rightly, and that is how it is.\n\n\n\n[In the following segment, also from Book 1 of On the Laws, Cicero or \u201cM\u201d is speaking quite continuously until the very end of the selection. He brings into focus the tension between a true and natural justice and ordinary notions of utility and pleasure.]\n\n\n\n[40] But if the penalty, not nature, ought to keep men from wrong, tell me what torment would harass the impious once the fear of punishments has been removed? Nevertheless, none of them was ever so daring that he did not either deny that he was guilty of a crime or fabricate some reason for just indignation and seek a defense of the crime in some right of nature. If the impious dare to call it this, with what eagerness will good men worship them, I ask!\n\n\n\nBut if a penalty, if fear of punishment, and not disgrace itself, deters from a wrongful, criminal life, no one is unjust, and instead the wicked ought to be held to be incautious. [41] Then, moreover, those of us who are moved to be good men not by what is honorable itself but by some advantage and enjoyment are cunning, not good. For what will a man do in the darkness who is afraid of nothing except a witness and a judge? What will he do in a deserted place if he has found someone whom he can deprive of much gold, someone weak and alone? Indeed our man who is just and good by nature will even speak with him, help him, lead him on his way. In fact he who will do nothing for the sake of another person and measure everything by his own convenience\u2013you see, I suppose, what he is going to do. But if he denies that he is going to snatch his life and take away his gold, he will never deny it on the ground that he judges it disgraceful by nature, but that he fears that it might become known and the result might be bad. O worthy deed, for which not only learned but also boorish men may blush!\n\n\n\n[42] But truly the most foolish thing is to think that everything is just that has been approved in the institutions or laws of peoples. And if those laws are from tyrants? If the Thirty at Athens had wanted to impose laws, or if all the Athenians delighted in tyrannous laws, surely those laws should not be held to be just for that reason? No more, I suppose, than that one that our interim ruler provided, that the dictator could kill whomever of the citizens he wanted with impunity, even for an unspoken reason. For right is uniform; human fellowship has been bound by it and one law has established it, which law is right reason of commanding and prohibiting. He who is ignorant of it is unjust, whether it has been written somewhere or nowhere. Now if justice is compliance with the written laws and institutions of peoples, and if (as the same men say) everything ought to be measured by advantage, he who thinks that it will be enjoyable for himself will neglect and burst apart those laws if he can. So it happens that there is no justice at all if not from nature, [and] what is established for the sake of advantage is undermined by that advantage.\n\n\n\n[43] And if right has not been confirmed by nature, they may be removed [missing portion of the text] In fact where will liberality be able to exist, where affection for the fatherland, where dutifulness, where the will either to deserve well of another or to return gratitude? For these things originate from this, that we are inclined by nature toward cherishing men; that is the foundation of right. And not only allegiances toward men but also ceremonies and religious observances for the gods are removed, which I think ought to be preserved not by fear but by the connection that exists between man and god. But if rights were established by peoples\u2019 orders, if by leading men\u2019s decrees, if by judges\u2019 verdicts, there would be a right to rob, a right to commit adultery, a right to substitute false wills, if those things were approved by votes or resolutions of a multitude. [44] But if there is such power in the sentiments and orders of the foolish that the nature of things is changed by their votes, why don\u2019t they establish that those things bad and destructive should be held to be good and salutary things? Or if law can make right out of wrong, can\u2019t the same law make good out of bad? But we can divide good law from bad by no other precept than that of nature.\n\n\n\nNot only right and wrong are distinguished by nature, but also in general all honorable and disgraceful things. For nature makes common understandings for us and starts forming them in our minds so that honorable things are based on virtue, disgraceful things on vices. [45] Moreover, to think that these things have been based on opinion, not on nature, is for a madman. For what is said to be the virtue of a tree or a horse (in which cases we misuse the name) has been situated not in opinion but in nature. And if that is so, honorable and disgraceful things must also be distinguished by nature. Now if the whole of virtue were determined by opinion, its parts would also be determined by the same opinion. Therefore, who would judge a man to be prudent and, as I will say, clever not from his own deportment but from some external circumstance? In fact virtue is perfected reason, and this is certainly in nature; therefore all honorableness is in nature in the same way. For as true and false things are judged on their own terms, not by other terms, and the same with consequences and opposites, so also a constant and perpetual manner of life, which is virtue, and also inconsistency, which is vice, will be tested according to their nature.[missing portion of text] Do we not do the same with young persons\u2019 character? [46] Or will character be judged by nature,and the virtues and vices that emerge from character otherwise? Or if those things are not otherwise, yet will it not be necessary for honorable and disgraceful things to be measured according to nature? [missing text] Whatever good thing that is praiseworthy necessarily has in itself that for which it is praised; for good itself is not by opinions but by nature. For if it were not so, people would also be blessed by opinion. What more foolish thing can be said than that? Therefore, since good and bad are judged by nature, and these things are elements of nature, certainly also honorable and disgraceful things must be distinguished in a similar manner and measured according to nature.\n\n\n\n[47] But the variety of opinions and the disagreement among men disturb us; and because the same thing does not hold for the senses, we think they are certain by nature, and those things that appear one way to some people and another way to others, and not always one way to the same people, we say are false. That is far off the mark. For neither a parent, nor a nurse, nor a teacher, nor a poet, nor the stage perverts our senses, nor does the agreement of the multitude distract them from the truth. Against our minds all [sorts of] plots are directed, either by those whom I just listed, who have taken them when they were delicate and unrefined and stain and bend them as they want, or by that which occupies a place entangled within our every sensation, pleasure, that imitator of the good and mother of all bad things; corrupted by her flatteries, they do not sufficiently notice what things are good by nature, because they lack this sweetness and itch.\n\n\n\n[48] What follows\u2013to conclude my whole speech\u2013is before our eyes from what has been said, that both right and everything honorable should be sought for their own sake. And indeed all good men love fairness itself and right itself, and it is not for a good man to err and to cherish what should not be cherished in itself; therefore, right should be sought and cultivated for its own sake. Now if that is true for right, so also for justice; and if for that, then the remaining virtues should also be cultivated for their own sake. What about liberality? Is it disinterested or mercenary? If a good man is benevolent without a reward, it is disinterested; if for payment, it is hired. There is no doubt that he who is said to be liberal or benevolent is following duty, not enjoyment. Therefore, justice also elicits no reward, no repayment; therefore, it is sought for its own sake, and the same motive and sense exist for all virtues.\n\n\n\n[49] And even if virtue is weighed according to its gains, not according to its own nature, there will be one virtue, which will most rightly be said to be badness. For as much as each man judges what to do according to his own convenience, so little is he a good man, as those who measure virtue by reward consider nothing to be a virtue except badness. For where is the benefactor if no one acts benevolently for the sake of another? Where is the grateful man if even those who are grateful do not respect the person to whom they return gratitude? Where is that sacred friendship if not even the friend himself is loved for his own sake, with whole heart, as it is said? He should even be deserted and cast aside, once hope of gains and enjoyments has been lost. What more monstrous thing can be said than that? But if friendship should be cultivated for its own sake, human fellowship, equality, and justice should also be sought for their own sake. But if that is not so, there is no justice at all. For the very height of injustice is to seek payment for justice.\n\n\n\n[50] Indeed, what shall we say about modesty, what about temperance, what about self-control, what about a sense of shame, decency, and chastity? Are we not to be impudent for fear of infamy, or of laws and law-courts? Then are people innocent and shameful in order to hear good things [about themselves], and do they blush in order to collect good hearsay? I am ashamed to speak of chastity at this point, and I am ashamed of those philosophers who think it is [a word cannot be translated] to avoid any judgment without avoiding the vice itself [uncertain text here]. [51] What then? Can we say that those people are chaste who are kept from defilement by fear of infamy, although infamy itself follows on account of the disgrace of the matter? For what can be rightly praised or disparaged if you withdraw from its nature what you think should be praised or disparaged? Will misshapen bodies, if they are very remarkable, give some offense, and deformity of the mind give none, the disgrace of which can be most easily perceived from its very vices? For what can be said to be fouler than avarice, what more monstrous than lust, what more scorned than cowardice, what more despicable than dullness and foolishness? What then? Do we say about those who are conspicuous for their individual vices, or even many vices, that they are wretched because of losses or damages or tortures, or because of the force and disgrace of their vices? That again can be said as praise in the matter of virtue, in the opposite [direction].\n\n\n\n[52] Finally, if virtue is sought because of other things, necessarily there is something better than virtue. Is it then property, or honors, or beauty, or strength? When these are present, they are very small, and it is in no way possible to know for certain how long they are going to be present. Or is it\u2013what is most disgraceful to say\u2013pleasure? But indeed virtue is most noticed in spurning and rejecting that.\n\n\n\nBut do you see what a series of matters and thoughts this is, how some things are woven out of another? I would slide farther if I did not hold myself back.\n\n\n\nQ: In what direction, I ask you? For gladly, brother, would I slide forward with you where you are leading with that speech.\n\n\n\nM: Toward the end of good things, by which all things are judged and for the sake of obtaining which all things should be done: a disputed matter and full of disagreement among very learned men, but which must nevertheless be judged at some time.\n\n\n\n[Cicero (M) is speaking in this brief segment drawing special attention to the importance of knowledge of self in the context of the whole of the universe and nature\u2019s way and then of being able to defend the understanding gained with rhetorical abilities.]\n\n\n\n[58] But surely the matter is such that, since it is proper for the law to be the corrector of vices and the recommender of virtues, teaching about living is drawn from it. It so happens that [text missing] the mother of all good things, wisdom (from the love of which philosophy found its name in a Greek word). Nothing given for human life by the immortal gods is richer, nothing is more flourishing, nothing is preferable. For this alone has taught us, along with all the other things it has taught us, what is most difficult: that we should know ourselves. There are such force and sense behind this principle that it was credited not to a man but to the Delphic god.\n\n\n\n[59] For he who knows himself will think first that he has something divine, and that his own natural abilities within himself are like a sort of consecrated image. And he will always do and feel something worthy of such a great gift of the gods. And when he has examined and completely tested himself, he will understand how he has come into life equipped by nature, and how great are the furnishings he has for obtaining and securing wisdom, since in the beginning he conceived the first, so to speak, sketchy understandings of all things in his soul and mind. When they have been made lucid, with wisdom as leader, he discerns that he is a good man and that for this very reason he is going to be blessed.\n\n\n\n[60] For once the virtues have been recognized and perceived, then when the soul has departed from the allegiance to and indulgence of the body, and has crushed pleasure like some stain of dishonor, and has escaped all fear of death and pain, and has entered the fellowship of affection with his own, and has regarded as his own all those joined with him by nature, and has undertaken the worship of the gods and pure religion, and has sharpened the sight of his native mental ability, like that of his eyes, for culling good things and rejecting the opposite (a virtue that has been called prudence from foreseeing)\u2013what can be said or thought that is more blessed than that?\n\n\n\n[61] And when the same man has examined the sky, lands, seas, and the nature of all things, and he has seen whence they have been begotten, whither they will return, how they will perish, what in them is mortal and frail, what is divine and eternal, and he has almost grasped [the god] himself who controls and rules these things, and he has recognized that he is not surrounded by the walls of some place, but is a citizen of the whole universe as if it were one city\u2013in this magnificence of things, and with this view and knowledge of nature, oh immortal gods, how he will know himself (as Pythian Apollo has instructed), how he will scorn, how he will look down upon, how he will think those things are for nothing that the crowd says are the most distinguished!\n\n\n\n[62] And he will fortify all these things as if by a sort of barrier through the method of discussing, the knowledge of judging true and false, and a sort of art of understanding what follows each thing and what is opposite to it. And when he senses that he has been born for civil fellowship, he will think that he must use not only precise argument but also speech that is continual and extended more broadly, through which he may rule peoples, stabilize laws, chastise the wicked, protect the good, praise famous men, issue precepts for health and fame suitable for persuading his fellow citizens, be able to urge to splendor, turn back others from shame, console the stricken, and pass on in everlasting memorials the deeds and resolutions of the courageous and the wise with the ignominy of the wicked. So many and so great are the things that are clearly seen to be present in man by those who want to know themselves; their parent and educator is wisdom."}, {"url": "https://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:80444/xv13369", "page_content": "Overview of the Collection\n\nTitle Cicero Hunt Lewis residence photographic collection Dates circa 1890-1910 (inclusive) 1890 1910 Quantity 0.1 cubic feet , (1 folder in shared box) Collection Number Org.

For as Plato after he had written on government in general, drew up a body of laws adapted to that particular form of it which he had been delineating, so Cicero chose to deliver his political sentiments in the same method, not by translating Plato, but imitating his manner in the explication of them. This work being designed, then, as a supplement, or second volume to his other, upon the Commonwealth, was distributed probably as the other was, into six books, for we meet with some quotations among the ancients from the fourth and fifth, though there are but three now remaining, and those in some places imperfect. In the first of these he lays open the origin of laws, and the source of obligations, which he derives from the universal nature of things, or, as he explains it, from the consummate reason and will of the supreme God. In the other two books, he gives a body of laws, conformable to his own plan and idea of a well\u2013ordered state. First, those which relate to religion, and the worship of the gods. Secondly, those which prescribe the duties and powers of the several magistrates, from which the peculiar form of each government is denominated. These laws are generally taken from the old constitution or custom of Rome, with some little variation and temperament, contrived to obviate the disorders to which that commonwealth was liable, and to give a stronger turn toward the aristocratic side. In the other books, which are lost, he treated, as he tells us, of the particular rights and privileges of the Roman people.\u201d (Vide Middleton\u2019s Life of Cicero).\n\nA larger explanation of the history and nature of this work, is given by M. Morabin, its French translator. Morabin deserves the gratitude of all the lovers of Cicero, for he not only wrote a biography of him, almost equal in merit to Middleton\u2019s, but translated his greatest works into his native language. His preface to the De Legibus is so just and comprehensive that we choose to translate it almost entire.\n\n\u201cThis Treatise on Laws (says Morabin) composed by Cicero, is one of the most valuable monuments which antiquity has bequeathed to us. And if among those works of Tully, which the barbarous ravages of time have destroyed, we regret especially the loss of a large portion of his commonwealth, we must likewise feel disappointed that only three books of his laws still survive, which form the natural supplement to the admirable politics of the preceding masterpiece.\n\nCicero was not merely an orator and philosopher: he was also a statesman. Being perfectly acquainted with the interests of the Roman government, and conversant with all branches of natural, national, and civil law, he added to the grand speculations of jurisprudence a practical intimacy with public affairs, in which he was deeply engaged during the most critical periods.\n\nThus, we cannot doubt, that, as the students of eloquence emulated the rhetoric of this great master of oratory, so likewise did statesmen and lawyers derive from these his political and legal writings, maxims of inestimable value, inasmuch as they were adapted to prove, as St. Augustin expresses it, that all true state policy must be perfectly harmonious with the principles of justice.\n\nThe general design of Cicero\u2019s books on the Commonwealth and the Laws is taken from those works of Plato which bear the same titles. But Cicero executed this design in a very original and yet practical manner, according to the lessons of his personal experience. Far from seeking to change the ancient Roman constitution, I conceive his main object was to reform the abuses of the new one.\n\nIn a period when the ambition of the nobles and the spirit of independence and faction among the people were hastening on that terrible tragedy whose last act could only terminate in the loss of liberty, Cicero depicted before the eyes of his fellow\u2013citizens, the image of the Roman Commonwealth in its best conceivable state, when laws, morals, discipline, subordination, patriotism, justice, disinterestedness, frugality, and the other virtues were encouraged and patronized.\n\nHe therefore sought to convince all his fellow\u2013citizens who retained the sentiment of national honour, that the integrity and excellence of the state, must consist in the integrity and excellence of their lives and manners. To feel convinced of this, it is only necessary to read a passage in the fifth book of his Commonwealth, which St. Augustine has preserved, in which Cicero after having quoted this verse of Ennius,\n\n\u201cThe wealth of Rome in men and manners lies,\u201d\n\nthus continues:\u2014\n\n\u201cWhat remains to us of ancient manners and discipline? Alas! their traces are so much effaced, that they are not even to be recognized, where it is most desirable they should be practised. What shall we say of the men of our times? The true reason why our manners are corrupted, is because our men are degenerated. A strange predicament! in which we are impleaded in the court of conscience, and are obliged to exculpate ourselves as well as we can from the charge of being accomplices in those political abuses, which have left us little more than the phantom of our glorious commonwealth, the vain name and shadow of a blessing, whose reality we have long since lost.\u201d\n\nThe reader may very reasonably expect to find this same spirit of high\u2013toned patriotism, which is so conspicuous in Cicero\u2019s Commonwealth, prevalent in his Treatise on Laws, which we now translate for the public benefit. Indeed the main object of these books, is to prove that justice and law are the only secure foundations of all rational societies.\n\nIn the First Book, Cicero endeavours to establish the correct principles of that justice and law whose names are vulgarly employed to signify the regulations of legislators, and the decisions of judges; and which, understood in this current popular sense, do not impress the mind with that sublime veneration, which justice and law in their higher relations necessarily inspire.\n\nCicero therefore insists in his present treatise, that both justice and law derive their origin from God himself; that they have therefore an eternal and immutable morality; that they are institutions of universal nature, or rather nature itself; the bond of affinity that attaches all moral beings to the gods, and the main\u2013spring of that sociality which binds men to each other; the principle which elicits gratitude to our Creator, and sympathy for our fellow\u2013creatures, the invariable rule of all equity, honour, and happiness; the universal light common to all men, which at once irradiates the reason of the philosopher, and which reveals to the unstudious multitude, the loveliness of the virtues which constitute the honest man and the good citizen.\n\nIn the first part of the Second Book, Cicero discusses those laws which concern religion, the worship of God, the sacred festivals, ministrations, and ceremonials. In the second, he illustrates them, and shews their wisdom and propriety.\n\nHe pursues the same order in the Third Book, which treats of the laws respecting public rights, the duties of magistrates, their authorities, powers, functions, and personal qualities.\n\nA fragment quoted from the Fifth Book of Cicero\u2019s laws by Macrobius, convinces us that we have lost at least two of these books of laws. I say at least two, for from the manner in which the interlocutors employ the time, and the distribution of days in their dialogue, it appears highly probable that the original work was composed in six books, answerable to those of the Commonwealth. This, however, is merely a conjecture, and we have still to determine, whether the following fragment is quoted from the beginning or end of a book. The words are these.\n\n\u201cWould it not be more agreeable, since the sun has only just past his meridian line, and these young shrubs do not yet afford sufficient shadow to protect us from his beams,\u2014would it not be more agreeable that we should descend to the banks of the Liris, and conclude our conversation under the elm trees?\u201d\n\nBut beside this loss, which is irreparable, the first of those books which are extant, is interrupted by lacunes and gaps in three or four places, and there is a gap in the Third Book which absorbs the expositions of more than half the magisterial laws therein discussed.\n\nBesides this misfortune, whether the MSS. were corrupted from which the editions of these books on the Laws were printed, or whether they wanted the last polish of Cicero\u2019s hand,\u2014for they were probably posthumous publications,\u2014they contain many passages which appear unfinished and broken. This circumstance, added to the difficulty of the subject\u2013matter, has deterred scholars from attempting to translate this treatise De Legibus, and very few versions of it exist in modern languages.\n\nThis fact, which I could not suppress, and which I cannot confess without trembling, would have altogether deterred me from this perilous undertaking, if I had looked merely to the difficulties of the case. But I did not stay to consider all the objections that might be urged, and, entirely occupied by the pleasure of giving the first translation of a work of Cicero in my native language, I was more gratified at finding that no one had undertaken my task before me, than if some ingenious scholar had forstalled my labours, and left me nothing but the honour of following him, with the treacherous hope of a better success.\n\nI therefore set about studying the first book, and translated it with a rapidity which fortified my former resolution. In the Second Book, however, the thorns began to make their appearance among the roses; and although encouraged by those to whom I showed my first essay, though sustained by the Commentary of Turnebus, so recommended by Scioppius and Casaubon, I should undoubtedly have stopped half way, had I not reflected that it was better to continue my work, even at the risk of never publishing it, in case my learned friends should think it unworthy, than abandon a labour which would then be labour lost, and for which no one would give me credit.\n\nWhat occasions still further embarassment to a translator of Cicero\u2019s Laws, is the use of certain terms referring to certain customs, which being exceedingly remote from our own, have no equivalents in our language, and which cannot be well expressed in the technical phrases of scholars, whose erudition and researches have not yet precisely determined the ideas we should attach to some of the words in the original.\n\nA man\u2019s life is by no means long enough to read all the books, essays, and dissertations that have been composed on these points of criticism. But I thought that though many of these difficult passages occur, especially in the Second and Third Books, there yet remain so many pieces of eloquence, so many grand sentiments, so many fine maxims, which may benefit persons of all ranks and orders, both in respect of public laws and private manners, that after having won the recommendations of those whose opinions I most prized, I might risk the imprimatur.\n\nAs respects this study of Public Law, the time we take in learning it is well spent, and no good reason can be alleged to excuse us from attending to it. We know that in the commerce of civil life, in the management of military affairs, at the bar, the court, and the mart, whether we play an active part on the stage of life, or whether we are mere spectators, this knowledge of public law is pre\u2013eminently important and serviceable.\n\nThe most casual glance at society will convince us that the majority of false measures and mistaken points of honour, without reckoning the erroneous ideas and reasonings which disgrace those who use them, and fatigue those who listen to them, are owing to voluntary ignorance of those great principles of law, which belong not merely to one particular profession, but affect the interests of all.\n\nImperfect therefore as this Treatise of Cicero on the Laws may seem, I am persuaded that it is still a very important work, which may give rise to the most seasonable reflections.\n\nThe First Book, which is full of the sublimest religion and morality, treats of the origin and essence of law, its causes, its objects, and its operations. It demonstrates the obligation which is imposed on every individual, to obey its injunctions, and to contribute his appropriate part to the general good of the society of which he is a member. Cicero tells him that the respect he owes to law, is not a mere human decency, but that the Author of nature has invested just laws with so much of his divine authority, that we cannot neglect or violate them without injuring and insulting the Deity, nor without contradicting our moral conscience, which no good man can fail to consult, and which no bad man can oppose without feeling remorse and compunction. He shows us that all the virtues which we ought to cultivate, always tend to our own happiness, and that the best means of promoting them consists in living with men in that perfect union and charity which are cemented by mutual benefits. Lastly, he informs us that penal laws have been invented only to restrain those whose love of justice is not sufficient to keep them within reasonable bounds. And he concludes, by depicting the character of the wise man, who illustrates these propositions in his life and conduct.\n\nIn the Second Book, which treats of religious worship, he discovers an infinity of facts, which serve to undeceive us on the false ideas which are entertained respecting the religion of the ancients. Cicero proves that they also believed and worshipped one true God in all his wonderful Theophanies and developements, and that the astonishing multiplicity of divinities which they venerated, was originally the product of a pious fear, but augmented and often corrupted by the interest of certain parties. The religion therefore of the ancient philosophers and sages, was only one form of the true theology, and it excites our admiration by showing us how frequently the grand doctrines of revelation are confirmed by the mythology of the heathens. Thus the great chain of divine truth, was preserved entire, even in the midst of that confusion of gods, sacrifices, festivals, and religious ceremonials, so generally idle, ridiculous, or profane.\n\nThe translation of the Third Book, is rather a disappointing task, owing to the great lacune which has deprived us of the explanations of a part of the laws which relate to public order.\n\nNotwithstanding these defects, we conceive that Cicero\u2019s Treatise on Laws may be advantageously placed in the hands of young students. Those who conduct the education of young people have often been censured for not more extensively instructing them in those practical sciences which hold the closest connection with real life and business. For want of this, as Petronius Arbiter justly observes, \u201cour students think themselves transported into another planet, when they draw their first breath in the world we live in.\u201d\n\nWe shall add to this preface of Morabin\u2019s the critical notice of this work on Laws, contained in the \u201cCyclop\u00e6dia Metropolitana:\u201d \u201cIn Cicero\u2019s Treatise de Legibus (say the editors), which was written two years later than his Commonwealth, and shortly after the murder of Clodius, he represents himself as explaining to his brother Quintus and Atticus, in their walks through the woods of Arpinum, the nature and origin of the laws, and their actual state in Rome and other countries. Law, he pronounces to be the perfection of reason, the eternal mind, the divine energy, which, while it pervades and unites the whole universe, associates gods and men by the most intimate resemblance of reason and virtue; and still more closely men with men, by the participation of common faculties and affections. He then proves at length that justice is not merely created by civil institutions from the power of conscience, the imperfections of human law, the moral sense, and the disinterestedness of virtue. He next proceeds to unfold the principles, first of religious law, under the heads of divine worship, the observance of festivals and games, the office of priests, augurs, and heralds, the punishment of sacrilege and perjury, the consecration of lands and the rights of sepulchres. Secondly, he proceeds to the investigation of the civil law, which gives him an opportunity of noticing the respective relations of magistrates and citizens.\n\nThe splendid panegyrics which Cicero has here pronounced on divine law and universal justice, have given rise to many eulogies, scarcely less eloquent, with which the greatest divines, philosophers, and lawyers have adorned their works. A few of these are worth quoting, as they may serve to elevate our ideas of the importance of the subject, and induce us to study the topics of jurisprudence with more ardour and perseverance.\n\nThus, from one brilliant passage in this book of Laws, has Hooker derived that well\u2013known exordium in his Ecclesiastical Polity, which is indisputably the finest specimen of his eloquence. \u201cOf Law no less can be said, than that her seat is the bosom of God, and her voice the harmony of the universe. All things in heaven and earth do her homage, the very least as feeling her care, and the greatest as not exempted from her power. Both angels and men, and creatures of what creation soever, though each in different sort and manner, yet all with uniform consent, admiring her as the Mother of their common peace and joy.\u201d Similar panegyrics on Law, are found in Cumberland\u2019s Law of Nature and Nations, Cudworth\u2019s Treatise on Eternal and Immatable Morality, and in the imperishable works of the immortal Selden.\n\nThis subject (says Williams) has been treated with much dignity by a writer who is admired by all mankind for his eloquence, but who is, if possible, still more admired by all competent judges for his philosophy. I allude to Burke, of whom I may justly say that he was \u201cgravissimus et dicendi et intelligendi auctor et magister;\u201d and I cannot refuse myself the gratification of quoting his words. \u201cThe science of jurisprudence (says he) is the pride of the human intellect; for, with all its defects, redundancies, and errors, it is the collected reason of ages, combining the principles of original justice with the infinite variety of human concerns.\u201d Dr. Johnson\u2019s reply to a person who was foolishly abusing the profession of the law, was, \u201cDo you presume, sir, to find fault with that study which is the last effort of human intelligence acting upon human experience?\u201d\n\n\u201cLaw (says Sir W. Blackstone) is a science which distinguishes the criterions of right and wrong; which teaches us to establish the one, and prevent, punish, and redress the other; which employs in its theory the noblest faculties of the soul, and exerts in its practice the cardinal virtues of the heart. A science which is universal in its use and extent, accommodated to each individual, yet comprehending the whole community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe science of jurisprudence (says Sir James Mackintosh, in his discourse on the study of the law of Nature and Nations) is certainly the most honourable occupation of the understanding, because it is most immediately subservient to the general safety and comfort. There is not, in my opinion, in the whole compass of human affairs, so noble a spectacle as that which is displayed in the progress of jurisprudence; where we contemplate the cautious and unwearied exertions of a succession of wise men through a long course of ages, withdrawing every case as it arises from the dangerous power of discretion, and subjecting it to inflexible rules; extending the dominion of justice and reason, and gradually contracting, within the narrowest possible limits, the domain of brutal force and arbitrary will.\u201d\n\nGranting the justice of these remarks, we cannot help lamenting that the science of jurisprudence or universal law, properly so called, should be so little studied in our British state at present. When we look into the history of literature, we find the times have been, in which men of the most consummate genius devoted that genius with the most ardent perseverance and the most mathematical precision, to the study of jurisprudence in its very loftiest and widest bearings. They hesitated not, through many years of incessant labour, like Grotius abroad and Selden at home, to study the vast system of moral obligations. In order to make themselves jurisconsults worthy of the name, they studied the divine laws handed down in Scripture, and developed in the ecclesiastical policy, ancient and modern. They studied the law of nature and nations, as explained by its oriental and classical commentators. They studied the civil laws of all states and commonwealths, and by a kind of comparative analysis, elicited the spirit of laws among all peoples, and confirmed just regulations by examples derived from the catholic experience of men in all ages and countries, and defeated the blunders of legislation, by showing their pernicious consequences, under every variety of circumstance.\n\nSuch men still appear occasionally in Europe and America. A few such may still grace the colleges, and the inns of court, or the open walks of literature; but their number has certainly become deplorably limited. We scarcely ever can find the man, now\u2013a\u2013days, who has studied jurisprudence in its loftier and broader relations,\u2014a man who, like Grotius, Selden, Montesquieu, or Sir W. Jones, can establish the doctrines of a sage and philosophical legislation, by an overwhelming accumulation of testimonies and facts, calculated to inspire confidence and ensure success. In consequence we meet with few who rise to those syncretic and universal maxims of equity and law, which throw a moral radiance through the long current of decisions, simplify the legal economy in its most important branches, and disperse the technical abuses that profane the sanctuary of Themis.\n\nSuch men are valuable in proportion to their rarity. They deserve the best patronage and promotion that the state can give them; for they are the true prophets and oracles of jurisprudence\u2014and they can speak with the force and precision of science, while others are proceeding through the perilous bye\u2013paths of quackery, pretence, and hap\u2013hazard.\n\nBut such men are not encouraged, and consequently their number is insignificant. Legal philosophy is slighted and unrewarded; while legal practice, however erroneous, is profusely paid for. The consequence is so plain and palpable that it has struck most of the Italian, German, and French writers on the subject. They say \u201cBritain has no jurists, but she has lawyers in abundance.\u201d (See Filangieri, Savigny, Pastoret, Constant, Guizot, Sismondi, and Chateaubriand, &c.)\n\nThis dangerous tendency of the age to sacrifice the higher doctrines of political and legal philosophy,\u2014such as most tend to develope the national mind and national resources,\u2014to a merely secular practice, which will take any form and impression for the sake of interest and emolument, is too much noted. These lower studies (says the author of the Natural History of Enthusiasm) fall in marvellously well with the frigid timidity of the times, and the love of practical utility. But that kind of discretion which can sacrifice truth for the sake of lucre, is always short\u2013sighted and fraught with peril.\n\nWe do sincerely believe that a sound knowledge of jurisprudence is quite as necessary as a familiarity with the practice of our courts, for all those who would truly deserve the name of legal reformers. And we more strenuously insist on this indispensable combination of theory and practice in relation to legal reforms, because it affords us the only hope of those ameliorations which have become of the utmost importance to the welfare of the British empire."}, {"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/harvard-theological-review/article/abs/law-of-nature-in-philo-and-cicero/DF7E5108BDC6FC5123195E75289DD168", "page_content": "Crossref Citations\n\nThis article has been cited by the following publications.

During the 1850s and 1860s, the Couch and Lewis Families grew dramatically in size and wealth. In 1870, when David was three, his immediate family had six brothers and sisters and three domestic servants. The US Census of 1870 recorded that Cicero, controlled real estate worth $15,000 and had $10,000 in his personal estate.

By the late 1870s, David would have ten siblings.\n\nDavid left Portland to attend Princeton University and Columbia University for undergraduate and graduate study, respectively. Between stints in school, Lewis returned to Portland c. 1890 to work; he visited Europe after Columbia, and then resettled in Portland. In 1900, he lived with his mother, six siblings and one sister-in-law at 125 19th Street in Portland, OR. This must have been a capacious mansion able to board that many family members and six servants including three household staff, two gardeners and a coachman.

His Portland address was 285 21st Street, where he lived with his wife and two maids.

His death certificate listed his place of residence as 285 North 21st Street in Portland, OR, and it indicated that Lewis had lived in the California Sanitorium for four months before his death. (The Portland, Oregon, City Directory, 1917, [p. 695] also listed his permanent address as 285 North 21st Street.) He was laid to rest in Riverview Cemetery in Portland, CA.\n\nParents\n\nHis father was Cicero Horatius Lewis, (born 1826 in Cranbury, NJ-d. 01/04/1897), who worked in 1880 as a wholesale grocer and was a prominent benefactor of the local Episcopalian church. His maternal grandfather was the early Portland, OR, businessman, Captain John Heard Couch (1811-1870), his maternal grandmother, Caroline E. Flanders Couch. His mother was Clementine Freeman Couch (born 10/1838 in Newburyport, MA-d. 1914), who had 11 children, all of whom survived into adulthood. David had a brother, Lucius Allen Lewis (1863-1935), for whom he designed a residence in 1901. Other siblings were: Mary Emma Lewis Bingham (1857-1944), John Couch Lewis (1859-1939), Elizabeth Lewis Good (1863-1928), Evelyn Scott Lewis Mills (1865-1936), Sarah Heard Lewis (01/1870-1964), Robert W. (born 12/1872), Cicero Hunt Lewis (07/24/1875-1952), Clementine Lewis Hall (09/1877-1965) and Francis (born 08/1880 in OR).\n\nSpouse\n\nLewis married Etta Jane Honeyman (b. 01/25/1884 in Portland, OR-d. 03/07/1932 in Phoenix, AZ) on 06/20/1906 in Portland. (See Ancestry.com, Source Citation Oregon State Library; Salem, Oregon; Oregon Marriage Indexes, 1906-2006; Reel: 1, accessed 05/30/2017.) her parents were William Honeyman (1840-1899) and Jane C. Dawson. They married 01/27/1864.\n\nShe subsequently married Jordan V. Zan (1876-1966). Etta Zan died in Phoenix, AZ, following a traffic accident at the age of 47.\n\nBiographical Notes\n\nRichard Ellison Ritz in his Architects of Oregon (Portland: Lair Hill Publishing, 2002), indicated incorrectly on p. 251 that his date of birth was December 21, 1867, not November 21, 1867. The correct date of birth is in David C. Chambers's own hand in an application to the Sons of the American Revolution, of 03/07/1900.

The focus will be on providing a sense of the distinctiveness of his philosophical approach, with particular attention paid to how his philosophical allegiance and method of composition contribute to forming a conception of philosophy that remains worthy of notice.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) is best known to posterity as a prominent statesman and orator in the tumultuous period of the late Roman republic. As well as being a leading political actor of his time, he also wrote voluminously. Among his writings, around a dozen philosophical works have come down to us. Philosophy was a lifelong passion for Cicero. In addition to what one might call his strictly philosophical compositions, much else of what he wrote \u2013 including his speeches, works on rhetoric, and a large collection of letters \u2013 show evidence of his philosophical interests. In terms of modern scholarship, the value of Cicero\u2019s philosophical work was held, until relatively recently, to lie chiefly in the information it provided about the thought of the leading philosophical schools of his day: Stoicism, Epicureanism and Academic scepticism among them. However, in part because of the creative way in which he engages with his predecessors, he is increasingly studied today as a philosophical thinker of independent interest.\n\n1. Cicero\u2019s Life and Times\n\nThere are a number of good studies of Cicero\u2019s life (e.g. Fuhrmann 1992, Rawson 1994, Tempest 2011); some background knowledge is salient to an understanding of his philosophical outlook. As already mentioned, Cicero lived through a turbulent historical period. Under the strains of empire, the Roman republican system of government had fractured, and was eventually to prove unsustainable. Cicero was both witness to and participant in some of the events that hastened the collapse of republican government and that ushered in, within fifteen years or so of his death, the rule of Augustus, first of the Roman emperors.\n\nCicero rose to the highest political office in the republic \u2013 the consulship \u2013 in 63 BCE. His period as consul was both the high-water mark of his political career and a fateful turning-point. While consul, he put down the conspiracy against the republic led by Catiline. But his actions led to his being exiled in 58; and, while he was restored to Rome the following year through the influence of Pompey, he could do little other than contemplate with horror the deterioration of relations between Caesar and Pompey that led to civil war and the ascendancy of Caesar to the dictatorship. Caesar\u2019s assassination in 44 brought only brief respite. Cicero himself was put to death on Mark Antony\u2019s orders in 43.\n\n2. Philosophy and Roman Society\n\nAs a staunch republican himself, Cicero frequently despaired of the state of the republic. Writing philosophy provided both consolation and a resource that, at least in more hopeful moments, he believed could help ameliorate the political crisis. One of the things that makes Cicero an interesting philosophical figure is his conviction that philosophy has the potential to change lives and make societies better. This belief in philosophy\u2019s practical purpose explains why much, though by no means all, of Cicero\u2019s philosophical production has a broadly ethical or political orientation.\n\nThe social and political backdrop is important in another way too. One of Cicero\u2019s purposes in writing philosophy is to bring the best of the Greek philosophical inheritance to wider Roman attention. That does not, however, mean that his works are simple philosophical manuals to be absorbed uncritically by their readership. A striking feature of Cicero\u2019s philosophical output is that it takes seriously and critically the question of the relation between abstract ideas, on the one hand, and the culture and tradition of particular societies (most saliently, for him, Rome), on the other.\n\nIndeed, Cicero treats this relation as bringing with it a set of distinctly philosophical questions about, for example, the normative weight to be assigned to the deliverances of rational theology as against traditional religious practice (see section 7.3 below), or to the precepts of an abstract ethical theory as against the theory\u2019s liveability in a concrete society (section 7.2 below). His discussions of the leading philosophical theories of his day tend to be used not for the purpose of firm advocacy of one particular set of doctrines or another, but to give his readers the tools to think through positions for themselves. Cicero\u2019s project of disseminating philosophy has the aim of inducing what he saw as the properly philosophical approach, one that is critical and open-minded.\n\n3. Dialogue and the Sceptical Stance\n\nHis philosophical compositions bear out this approach in two important and connected ways. Firstly, they are by and large written in dialogue form (see Gorman 2005, Schofield 2008). His adoption of the form in part reflects his admiration for Plato, whom he considered the greatest of all philosophers. Now Cicero\u2019s relation to Plato is a complex one (see Long 1995b, H\u00f6sle 2008, Bishop 2019 ch. 2), and his use of the dialogue form differed from Plato\u2019s, manifesting itself principally in opposed set speeches rather than rapid back-and-forth exchanges, though the latter are not completely absent from Cicero\u2019s work (and long speeches are common enough in Plato). We find Cicero also invoking the (now lost) dialogues of Aristotle and of the early Platonist philosopher Heraclides of Pontus as influences on him. Still, his favouring of dialogue over straight treatise shares the Platonic motive of engaging readers in active philosophical enquiry.\n\nThe majority of Cicero\u2019s philosophical writings feature a speaker or series of speakers setting out the views held on a core topic (for example, the nature of the gods, or the best way to live) by various philosophical schools, with a critique of those views mounted after each exposition, often by Cicero himself. Thus, in terms of their structure, his works lend themselves not to decisive acceptance or rejection of a particular view, but to a setting out of all sides of an argument so readers can make their own assessment.\n\nThis feature reflects, in turn, Cicero\u2019s allegiance to Academic scepticism. Now the extent and nature of this allegiance is a matter of debate (see Glucker 1988, G\u00f6rler 1995, Thorsrud 2012, Brittain 2016, Wynne 2018) but what matters for present purposes is that the sceptical stance takes it as a mistake to believe that certainty is possible. The most one can do is form a judgement that some particular position is more or less plausible than another, such a judgement itself being revisable in the light of further evidence or argument.\n\nThe truly philosophical approach is thus one that refuses to take any philosophical view as settled \u2013 including this very one (see section 7.1 below). Cicero thereby sets himself against the approach of the contemporary \u2018dogmatic\u2019 schools \u2013 in particular, Epicureanism and Stoicism \u2013 where dogmatism refers not to positions that are unargued for, but to doctrines regarded by their advocates as settled truth. Cicero\u2019s stance is not one that pits itself primarily against specific doctrines of these schools \u2013 the sceptic is entitled to adopt any view as plausible. Rather, what he opposes is a conception of intellectual endeavour as capable of arriving at certainty. The best philosophy is one that fosters critical enquiry; and the nature and role of philosophy must, by the same token, itself be in the critical spotlight.\n\n4. Philosophy and Oratory\n\nCicero\u2019s main philosophical production can be divided into two chronological periods. The first, from around 54\u201351 BCE, sees the writing of his two main works of political philosophy, the Republic and the Laws (the latter apparently unfinished), each loosely based on a Platonic archetype, together with his great work on the nature and role of oratory, On the Orator. The second period, during which he composed the greater part of his philosophical oeuvre, occurred in an astonishing two-year burst of creativity towards the end of his life, in 45 and 44. Although Cicero\u2019s writings on oratory (he composed several works on the topic) will not be discussed here, they should not be regarded as entirely distinct from his philosophical writings. That is because the relation between philosophy and oratory was of central importance to him. While this might sound arcane to a modern ear, what it encapsulated for Cicero was the vital question of how philosophy is best communicated.\n\nIn the Gorgias, Plato had Socrates mount a passionate attack on rhetoric, by contrast with philosophy, as concerned with mere persuasion rather than truth. For Cicero, as probably the supreme orator of his day, matters could not be that simple. The use of speech to manipulate others for self-serving ends could not, of course, be condoned. But the idea that pure reasoning, divorced from communicative skill, was sufficient to win people round to philosophy struck Cicero as, if anything, even more dangerously misguided. The resources of oratory must be recruited to the vital enterprise of disseminating philosophy to new audiences. Cicero often shows himself acutely conscious of criticism that a practical Roman should so much as attempt to write philosophy. By writing it in a way that was not alienating to its potential audience, he could aspire to draw his critics in despite themselves.\n\n5. The First Period: Philosophical Politics\n\n5.1 The Republic and Laws\n\nIt is perhaps no accident that Cicero\u2019s first two major philosophical works should be in political philosophy, given both the crisis faced by the republican system of government and the need to produce work in a field that would be regarded as suitable for a Roman statesman. But the Republic and Laws (in Latin De Re Publica and De Legibus respectively) are in at least one respect radical nonetheless: together with On the Orator, they introduce the dialogue form into Latin literature. And notwithstanding the influence of Plato, the two works can lay claim to being among the most original parts of Cicero\u2019s philosophy, since each deals to a substantial extent with the government and institutions of a state of which Plato could have had no inkling, namely Rome.\n\nBoth works are intensely Roman. The Republic takes as the best kind of state one that, to a large extent, consists in the traditional structures of the Roman republic. The Laws considers the sort of laws that will best maintain or restore those structures. To this extent, they challenge the idea, one that Cicero saw reflected in the utopianism of Plato\u2019s Republic, that political philosophy should proceed in isolation from consideration of actual political structures and societies. Yet, in ways that make their overall message far from straightforward, both are deeply influenced by abstract theory as well, and by questions of how theory, history and practical politics interact.\n\n5.2 The Republic\n\nIn the Republic, a work which unfortunately has not come down to us complete (none of its six books survive whole, with large portions missing especially from the last four), Cicero stakes out his position early with an attack on philosophers who argue that one should refrain from public affairs \u2013 he means principally Epicureans. The Stoics, in offering a more activist model, present the alternative view. The Stoic philosopher Panaetius, together with the Greek historian Polybius, is named in the main body of the dialogue as having discussed political matters with one of the work\u2019s principal speakers, Scipio (1.34); and the influence of Stoic political thinking is evident in the idea that humans share with gods dominion not just of the place in which they happen to live, but of the Earth and indeed the whole universe (1.19). Yet this cosmopolitan outlook in turn creates tension with the idea, also prominent in the dialogue, of the specialness of Rome, and raises the question of whether Roman exceptionalism can sit comfortably with a view of human beings as citizens of the world.\n\nIt is noteworthy that, even before embarking on a discussion of the nature of the state, Cicero is explicit in his preface (1.12) about the need to justify participation in public affairs, a stance that underlines his view that theories of good government are all very well but may be idle unless one makes the case that engaging in the public arena is the right thing to do. Yet, having commended the participant over the theoretician, Cicero goes on to say that he will now appeal to those who are moved by the authority of philosophers, and declares that in their discussions of government such philosophers have themselves discharged a public office.\n\nThe debate about the role of philosophy is reflected within the main body of the dialogue as well, and here it becomes if anything clearer that Cicero\u2019s purpose is not to play down philosophy but to play up the practically oriented way of doing political philosophy that he considers appropriate to the subject. At the same time, this enables him to present his writing on the topic as genuine progress over his Greek predecessors. It may, then, come as a surprise to find, in a work of supposedly practical orientation, that prior to Scipio\u2019s main exposition in Book 1 of the different types of political constitution, Cicero depicts a rather lengthy discussion of a cosmological event: the recent apparent sighting of a \u2018second sun\u2019 in the sky (1.15).\n\nScipio, even though he will take the lead role in the discussion of political theory, fulsomely praises the more abstract kinds of study directed at the celestial realm (1.26\u201328); but he is persuaded by Laelius, another participant, that it is of greater importance now to address terrestrial issues, particularly regarding the best form of government (1.30\u201334). The debate that Cicero lays out about the investigation of the human versus the divine realm makes the case for the study of both as having value, and intriguingly leaves open the question of the relation between the two: Scipio speaks of how the Earth pales into insignificance beside the heavens, and asserts that there is a universal natural law that has authority over any civil law, so that what has ultimate moral weight is the decree of the wise person who understands the natural law, rather than that of the Roman people (1.27). Similar principles are laid down at 3.33, anticipating the fuller discussion in the Laws. These are pronouncements with a strongly Stoic flavour; and when another participant, Philus, speaks of the Stoic notion that gods and humans share the whole universe as their homeland, he suggests that for that reason cosmology might be relevant to politics in any case (1.19).\n\nBy the time that we turn to Scipio\u2019s exposition of the various forms of government, it can be seen that Cicero has used the flexibility of the dramatic dialogue to prime his reader to examine the topic with a critical eye. Scipio\u2019s focus on Rome is a response to the lack of practical awareness that he (or his author) sees infecting Greek models. But if Stoic universalism is correct, such focus on a particular concrete system seems itself to be headed in the wrong direction. And if cosmology is more important than politics, yet too important for politics to ignore, then an exposition that sticks to the human realm \u2013 as Scipio\u2019s, as far as we can tell, largely does \u2013 is missing something. Cicero thus invites us, in the midst of a work on political theory, to consider how small the human (and within that the Roman) domain is, a thought reinforced in some complex ways in the dialogue\u2019s concluding Dream of Scipio, perhaps the most famous excerpt in all of Cicero\u2019s philosophy (its survival owed to its coming down to us as part of a separate manuscript tradition). In thus giving the work as a whole structural integrity (despite its, for us, truncated condition), Cicero\u2019s framing challenges the reader to maintain a critical perspective on the doing of political philosophy itself.\n\n5.3 The Laws\n\nIn Republic 5, Scipio had affirmed that the political leader requires knowledge of justice and of the laws and will have studied their foundations. The discussion of natural law in Laws 1 offers an account of those foundations. The purpose of such an account is to set the parameters within which more concrete laws must fall and be judged. The natural law is god\u2019s law; it is also what human beings who have perfected their reason would follow. Law is to be identified with right reason (1.23), or more specifically with right reason in the realm of what is commanded or forbidden (1.33, 1.42). This, then, is a normative account: it tells us what law, properly speaking, is; and that may be very different from the actual laws that particular states have enacted.\n\nGiven the normative character of Cicero\u2019s enquiry, it is not difficult to see why law should be identified with right reason. Rationality, after all, is itself a normative concept. Not every piece of thinking counts as rational, and rationality can be exercised imperfectly and so, at least in principle, perfectly. If one reasons correctly about the relevant matters in the case of what is just and unjust, then it seems fair to conclude that one will enunciate standards against which, for example, actual laws will be required to measure up. Law in the normative sense is \u2018what distinguishes just things from unjust\u2019 (2.13).\n\nIt is not as obvious why the concept of nature, or the natural, looms large in Cicero\u2019s account of law. One of its main purposes is, again, to stress that he is conducting a normative enquiry. We are, he says, \u2018born for justice\u2019, and what is right is a matter not of opinion but of nature (1.28). Here Cicero draws upon a tradition, already going back at least as far as Plato, in which nature stands in contrast with convention. What is merely a matter of convention or opinion is not the same as what is really \u2013 \u2018by nature\u2019 \u2013 the case. Thus the fact that a certain (human-made) law states that something is right or wrong does not mean that its pronouncements are correct.\n\nWhat is this nature that is thus contrasted with matters of opinion or convention? It is, in the first instance, human nature, as witnessed by Cicero\u2019s statement that \u2018we\u2019 are born for justice. We all belong to the same species, and to that extent are all alike (1.29), in particular in our possession of reason, which distinguishes us from other creatures (1.30). This explains the sense of mutual fellowship and union between human beings (1.28) and means that we are formed by nature to share justice and impart it to all (1.33). This does not mean that we necessarily do this. Nature is itself a normative concept, so humans can fail to live up to their own nature, corrupted by the effects of bad habit and opinion (1.29, 1.33). Nonetheless, Cicero argues, if one considers the endowments that humans share, one will conclude that justice is the natural human condition.\n\nBut nature also refers, compatibly, to the nature of the universe as a whole, since on the Stoic theory that Cicero draws upon (a theory set out more fully in Book 2 of Cicero\u2019s On the Nature of the Gods, see esp. 2.73\u201390), the universe \u2013 \u2018all of nature\u2019, as Cicero puts it \u2013 is governed by god (1.21). God in turn exercises governing power through the activity of right reason, which we humans, at least in our best condition, share with god (1.23). Reason is thus natural, in that it underlies the workings of the universe; and since we possess it too, as the divine element in us, in expressing our human nature it expresses our kinship with the gods as well. Hence Cicero can refer in Book 2 of the Laws to the \u2018true and original law\u2019 as identified with the right reason of god (2.10).\n\nCicero\u2019s thinking seems to be that to regard laws as no more than human artefacts \u2013 that is, as not based in nature \u2013 is to concede that reward and punishment are the only motivations for obedience. But then it will be the rewards and punishments, not the justice or injustice of the act in question, that will have normative force. But if that is so, then if one calculates correctly that, say, greater utility will arise from breaking than obeying a law, it seems that one has no reason to obey it. What is needed, rather, is a conception of justice as something to be sought, as Cicero puts it, \u2018for its own sake\u2019 (1.48). That is, we must think of what is just as having an inherent normative force, to be pursued because it is just. And that means, for Cicero, that justice must be based in nature and not simply a matter of human convention.\n\nWhether or not we find this stance convincing, there is a specific theory of justice that Cicero appears to have in mind as the object of his critique: the Epicurean theory. Epicurus regarded justice as precisely a matter of social agreements concluded with the aim of maximizing utility. One should further note that Cicero\u2019s friend Atticus is, along with Cicero\u2019s brother Quintus, one of Cicero\u2019s two main interlocutors in the dialogue, and that Atticus is an adherent of Epicureanism. His presence seems to emphasize that there is an alternative point of view that is not being given the opportunity to defend itself. Strikingly, Cicero does not even say that he thinks the Epicurean theory is wrong; rather, he bids the Epicureans abstain from all matters of government, which they neither know about nor have wished to know about (1.39). It is true that the Epicureans, unlike the Stoics, generally maintained a quietist outlook and believed that by and large one should not be politically active. But they did have a specific theory of justice. So Cicero seems a little high-handed in excluding them from a conversation featuring that as one of its principal topics.\n\nEpicureans are not the only ones whose views Cicero seems intent on marginalizing in this context. Remarkably, he asks the adherents of the New (that is, sceptical) Academy to \u2018be silent\u2019, since their habit of attacking any doctrinal view will cause \u2018confusion\u2019 and result in the ruin of Cicero\u2019s \u2018elegantly arranged edifice\u2019 (1.39). We have indeed just been reminded that Cicero himself is a follower of the sceptical Academy, with Atticus\u2019 ironical comment that Cicero is of course someone who does not follow his own judgement in debate but the authority of others (1.36). Cicero replies that he indeed does not always accept the authority of others but that he is here trying to establish a foundation for states and cities (1.37).\n\nShould we take Cicero at face value here? Although one can understand that having to deal with opposing views may make it more difficult to establish the kind of basis for systems of law and justice that he has in mind, that could surely apply to any philosophical thesis and any sort of opposition. One might even suppose that attacking an edifice, however elegantly constructed, might lead to a stronger edifice being built. Cicero in fact says that he would like to appease the sceptics and does not dare drive them off (1.39). So why does Cicero attempt just here to stifle debate? Why, in particular, does he draw attention to the fact that that is what he is doing? He need not have mentioned the sceptics, nor for that matter the Epicureans. He need not have chosen Atticus as a participant whom he could then ask not to dispute his basic premise.\n\nCicero clearly expects his readers to notice these moves. One might say that to announce loudly that one is closing down debate is itself to initiate a debate. Cicero thus uses the notion of uniformity of outlook both to illustrate and critique a crucial feature of the theory he is advocating. The idea of natural law is precisely the idea that there is a universal set of normative principles of equal applicability in all contexts. If that idea is correct, then there is no room for divergence of opinion about what justice is. At the same time, Cicero\u2019s dismissal of the Epicurean and sceptical viewpoints reminds us that, in the real world as opposed to the ideal one of perfected reason, there are competing and critical opinions, and that the universalist theory is itself a product of a particular philosophical school (Stoicism).\n\nOn the one hand, then, we have a vision of uniformity, representing a kind of ideal endpoint in which all is organized and measured in accordance with the same basic principles. On the other, we have concrete and divergent voices that embody a range of perspectives and show where we are now and perhaps \u2013 though the voices may change \u2013 where we will be at any specific historical moment: at some distance from an undisputed endpoint. In the very process of apparent suppression of dissent, Cicero uses the resources of the dialogue form to draw readers into critical participation in his enquiry.\n\n6. The Second Period: An Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n\nCicero\u2019s second, and most intense, period of philosophical production occurs during the last few years of his life, a period that saw the dictatorship and then assassination of Julius Caesar. The latter event caused Cicero\u2019s political stock to rise briefly but, in the end, brought only futile hope of the restoration of republican government. The political situation, combined with personal tragedy \u2013 the death of his daughter Tullia in childbirth \u2013 resulted in a remarkable bout of creativity during which Cicero produced substantial works on a wide range of philosophical themes. His ambition, as he puts it in his preface to On the Nature of the Gods (1.7), was to compose nothing less than a comprehensive treatment covering \u2018the whole of philosophy\u2019 \u2013 a veritable encyclopedia of the subject.\n\nFor the purposes of this entry, a more selective approach is adopted. Three late dialogues will be highlighted below, but the late period also saw the composition of two works likely to be relatively familiar to non-specialists: On Duties (De Officiis), concerning practical conduct, and Tusculan Disputations, on the theory of the emotions, together with a trio of works on mainly Stoic themes: On Fate (De Fato), On Divination (De Divinatione) and Stoic Paradoxes (Paradoxa Stoicorum), as well as a pair on specific issues in ethics: On Old Age (De Senectute) and On Friendship (De Amicitia). In what follows, further works from the period on each of three central topics \u2013 epistemology, ethical theory and theology \u2013 are discussed, in order to offer a representative illustration of the distinctiveness of Cicero\u2019s approach as an Academic sceptic and writer of philosophical dialogues.\n\n6.1 Epistemology\n\nAlthough it has come down to us in a rather misshapen state, containing portions of two quite different editions of the work, On Academic Scepticism (in Latin Academica) cannot be passed over, since it presents an account of the epistemological viewpoint of the sceptical Academy and so in effect serves as a defence of the method that Cicero employs in much of his philosophical writing. At the same time, Cicero does not present a one-sided picture. In the segment sometimes known (after its leading character) as the Lucullus, critique of the New, or sceptical, Academy is mounted, with Cicero responding on behalf of the sceptic.\n\nAgainst a position that denies that certainty is attainable, Lucullus argues that intellectual enquiry, which aims at proof, will be hamstrung, since proof requires certainty (2.26). Moreover, the sceptic\u2019s refusal to allow that there can be \u2018cataleptic\u2019 impressions \u2013 the Stoic technical term for impressions that can be grasped with certainty \u2013 will subject the sceptic to the charge of inconsistency (cf. 2.44): the sceptic holds that nothing can be grasped with certainty, but surely the claim that \u2018nothing can be grasped with certainty\u2019 must itself be graspable with certainty, or else the sceptic position lacks firm foundation.\n\nIf the sceptics have their own counterpart of a criterion of truth, in terms of the notion of plausibility, they must surely regard that notion as beyond dispute if it is to play its allotted role (2.29). Given the importance of correctly identifying the proper basis for one\u2019s decisions and actions, it cannot for the sceptic be merely plausible, but must be certain, that plausibility is the right criterion. Sceptics are thus impaled on a dilemma: their system undermines itself by being either inconsistent (if \u2018nothing can be grasped\u2019 is graspable) or ineffectual (if it is not graspable).\n\nLucullus continues to take aim at the notion of plausibility that features as the sceptics\u2019 criterion for determining what we accept and do (2.32); but he approaches it in a way that might seem to beg the question, asking how the sceptic can maintain a criterion of truth and falsehood if truth and falsehood are indistinguishable (2.33). It seems as if the sceptic could reply that they do not in fact have such a criterion. They do not, unlike their dogmatic opponents, claim to pronounce one thing true, another false. What they can do \u2013 what, if they are right, is the most one can do \u2013 is identify one thing as plausible, another as implausible.\n\nLucullus has an interesting riposte to this, which involves questioning the intelligibility of being able to determine what is plausible and what is not without a criterion for determining what is true and what is not. He points out that in rejecting the cataleptic impression, the sceptic does not allow that there are impressions distinctively marked out as truth-bearing. But if so, it follows that there is no difference between true and false, in the sense that there is nothing about a given impression that will mark it out as true rather than false. So, says Lucullus, \u2018there will be no criterion\u2019 (2.34). In other words, without a means of determining which is true, no impression will be more deserving of credence than any other.\n\nMoreover, the notion of plausibility is, logically, tied to the notion of truth: what is plausible is what \u2018resembles truth\u2019, in Latin veri simile, the phrase Cicero uses as an alternative for probabile to represent the concept of plausibility. If something is plausible, then it is likely (though not certain) to be true. But the sceptics by their own admission have no criterion for determining what is true. Hence, they have no way of judging something as likely to be true, since that presupposes a standard of truth against which the purported plausibility would be judged.\n\nCicero responds by sketching a distinction, made by the sceptical philosopher Clitomachus, of two ways in which one might withhold assent: by refraining (a) from \u2018completely\u2019 assenting to anything, and (b) from approving or disapproving. The wise sceptic will never completely assent to any impression but will \u2018approve\u2019 those that are plausible and \u2018disapprove\u2019 those that are not. One will then be able to act on the basis of those impressions one approves, without having entirely assented to them (2.104).\n\nThe distinction has an air of sophistry about it, but it corresponds reasonably well to the way we actually make decisions. Take a simple case of my deciding whether to drink the tap water in my glass. It looks and smells healthy, there seems nothing to suggest otherwise. Nonetheless it might always be the case that it is unhealthy. I \u2018approve\u2019 the impression that it is healthy and drink the water, while accepting that it cannot, strictly speaking, be certain but at most plausible that the water is healthy; hence I do not \u2018completely\u2019 assent to the impression. If it turns out to be unhealthy, my original impression was not mistaken, because I only took it to be plausible, rather than true, that the water was healthy, which is consistent with its being unhealthy. Thus the wise sceptic can act on the basis of mere plausibility while in an intelligible sense not getting things wrong.\n\nCicero suggests that even the Stoic sage will follow many things on the basis of plausibility, if life is to be possible at all (2.99); and his point, I take it, is supposed to apply not just in case it turns out that there are no cataleptic impressions, but even in those (presumably frequent) situations where such impressions, should they exist, are not present. The wise still have to live. Indeed, if one includes the crucial refinement made by the leading sceptical philosopher Carneades as part of the plausibility criterion \u2013 namely that the impression must be \u2018unimpeded\u2019 (2.104) \u2013 then we seem to have a way of addressing Lucullus\u2019 point that to have a notion of plausibility, or being likely to be true, depends on one\u2019s having a prior notion of truth as such.\n\nWhat does \u2018unimpeded\u2019 mean? Cicero spoke at 2.99 in terms of there being nothing that presents itself in opposition to the plausibility of the impression. Take the example of the water again. It looks healthy in my glass, it comes from a generally reliable source (my tap), there is nothing to indicate that it is not healthy \u2013 nothing, therefore, \u2018impeding\u2019, or presenting itself in opposition to, the plausibility of the impression that it is healthy. Say, further, that I then hear on the radio a news report that the water supply in my area has been contaminated. At this point there is something opposing \u2013 undercutting, one might say \u2013 the plausibility of the impression that the water is healthy and I would not therefore drink it.\n\nHow does this tell against Lucullus\u2019 criticism? It suggests that, rather than plausibility being dependent on truth, we might build a notion of truth upon that of unimpeded plausibility. Take the water case once again. What would it mean to be able to identify as true the impression that \u2018this water is healthy\u2019? It could be argued that its truth would be a matter of there being nothing to oppose the impression of plausibility \u2013 no \u2018defeaters\u2019, as it were. Say, then, that I turn on the radio and hear no news reports pertaining to my water; but being the ultra-cautious type I send the water to a lab for testing. It turns out that the sample is laden with harmful microbes. There is thus something opposing the plausibility of the impression that the water is healthy.\n\nIt seems as if one could move towards a notion of truth by utilising the condition that there is nothing opposing an initial impression that things are a certain way \u2013 in the water case, no news report, no adverse lab results, and so forth. This would still be a notion of truth as something possessed fallibly. But the sceptic can now speak of identifying some things as true (rather than as simply plausible) and others as the contrary (2.111). Carneades at any rate is not trying to provide an equivalent of the Stoic notion of infallible truth-possession. His \u2018unimpeded\u2019 condition is a refinement designed to give a criterion of reasonable action in the absence of such a notion. What one can do, using Carneades\u2019 method, is start with the impression of something\u2019s being the case and approach, but never reach, a position of certainty. It is a question of increasing the likelihood of correctness, not eliminating completely the possibility of error.\n\nIf so, then Cicero can likewise reject Lucullus\u2019 assertion that the sceptic must (inconsistently) hold their own theory of plausibility as certain. He reiterates Carneades\u2019 view that the theory, like any other claim, could at most have the status of plausibility by the very terms of the theory (2.110). Seen in the light of the \u2018unimpeded\u2019 condition, plausibility now looks a more robust notion than it may have appeared, and so the resting of one\u2019s whole procedure for decision and action on such a basis looks correspondingly less fragile, though of course it is still fallible. But scepticism deserves to be rejected not if it cannot claim certainty for its guiding principle, but if it fails to apply to itself the same standards of critical scrutiny that it does elsewhere.\n\nIn perhaps Cicero\u2019s most technical work, he rarely allows us to lose sight of what purpose the technicality serves. Lucullus had ended his speech in critique of scepticism by addressing Cicero himself, making what looks like a light-hearted jest that Cicero supports a philosophy that keeps things in the dark despite his having brought the most deeply hidden matters to light (2.62). He refers to the uncovering by Cicero of Catiline\u2019s conspiracy, a plot whose nature and significance remain a matter of debate, but whose thwarting Cicero refers to often and takes to represent his having more or less single-handedly saved the republic from catastrophe.\n\nThe punning contrast of obscurity and illumination that Lucullus employs thus has a serious point, reminding us that what turns on the sometimes abstruse epistemology is the vital practical question of whether the sceptical viewpoint allows there to be a proper basis for decision and action, especially on the political stage. Roman \u2013 and of course not just Roman \u2013 politicians, including Cicero himself and those whom he might hope to win over to the sceptical cause, must at times take life-and-death decisions.\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Cicero\u2019s actions against Catiline was the execution without trial of five of the alleged co-conspirators, an act that ultimately led to Cicero\u2019s exile. Is mere likelihood sufficient to justify the weight of one\u2019s actions in such cases? Should not certainty be the only proper basis? And is a criterion of plausibility even intelligible without a notion of certainty? Whatever we think of Cicero\u2019s answers to these questions, he leaves us in no doubt about why the questions matter. Even at its most abstract, philosophy\u2019s relation to the concrete and practical lies at the heart of his enterprise.\n\n6.2 Ethical Theory\n\nCicero\u2019s principal work on ethical theory, On Ends or On Moral Ends (in Latin De Finibus), offers perhaps the most vivid example of his use of the sceptical method to engage critically with questions about the nature of philosophy itself. The title abbreviates a longer Latin title (De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum) whose meaning \u2013 literally, On Ends of Goods and Evils \u2013 raises puzzles of its own (on which see Allen 2014), but refers, to simplify a little, to the question of what are the highest goods, the attainment of which will bring about a happy human life. Cicero considers three leading ethical theories of his day: Epicureanism, which proposes that pleasure is the highest good; Stoicism, which holds that virtue is not just the highest but the only good; and the theory of the so-called Old Academy, which, while including goods other than virtue within its conception of the supreme good, ranks virtue higher than the rest. The structure of the work is once again dialogical: for each theory, Cicero puts into the mouth of a proponent an exposition of that theory, followed by a critical response delivered by Cicero himself.\n\nCicero allows himself a head start on the exposition of Epicurean hedonism by its proponent Torquatus with an initial, critical outline of the theory in Book 1. At 1.23\u201324 he appeals to the behaviour of two of Torquatus\u2019 ancestors, both stern military men who treated their sons harshly (execution for cowardice and banishment for taking bribes, respectively), behaviour which in Cicero\u2019s view can only be explained by their having put the wider public interest ahead of their own pleasure, contrary to Epicurean prescription.\n\nCicero chooses examples that, in combining military with family, evoke core ancient Roman values. Torquatus then defends his ancestors\u2019 behaviour in terms compatible with Epicurean theory. Focusing in particular on the first Torquatus, he argues that he acted to uphold his authority at a time of war, and therefore to enhance his own security and so, ultimately, pleasure. More striking than the details of Torquatus\u2019 explanation is that he feels the need to give it. Why could he not have said that his ancestors were misguided and that it took later generations to see the Epicurean light? Torquatus says explicitly that he has no reason to fear that he cannot \u2018accommodate\u2019 his ancestors to the Epicurean view (1.34). That he rises to Cicero\u2019s challenge in this way indicates that ancestral behaviour has normative force for him: his ancestors must be read as acting from (what he considers) the correct motives.\n\nInterestingly, it appears that Torquatus\u2019 own father was an Epicurean, whom Torquatus evidently admired. He reports with enthusiasm his father\u2019s rebuttal of a Stoic argument against hedonism (1.39); and, though this is not said explicitly, perhaps was influenced by his father in adopting Epicureanism himself. Cicero thus slyly reinforces the sense that ancestral piety is an ineliminable part of the value system that Torquatus shares. He has induced Torquatus to agree that it would be a problem for the validity of Epicurean ethics if it did not sit comfortably with the norms of Roman culture. The reader is thus encouraged to reflect on whether, and if so how, the abstract and general features of an ethical theory are to fit with outlooks and practices which, at least in part, carry normative weight precisely because they represent adherence to a particular tradition: a strategy that Cicero further deploys in his more lengthy critique of Epicurean ethics in Book 2 (see Inwood 1990).\n\nHowever difficult it might be for Torquatus himself, it seems open to an Epicurean to respond that they have no obligation to simply accept Roman values as authoritative. Epicurean theory is professedly a radical one that sees most humans as having been corrupted by false values. What, then, should we, as non-Roman readers, make of Cicero\u2019s discussion? Even if we accepted that he demonstrates an incompatibility between Roman and Epicurean values, it is not clear that this should have any hold on us. We are surely both able and entitled to assess the Epicurean case on its own merits. On the other hand, we are no less the inheritors of cultural assumptions and outlooks than the Romans, even if ours are different, and even if the \u2018we\u2019 implied are a great and diverse plurality. Disentangling a thing\u2019s \u2018own merits\u2019 from the values we bring to an encounter with it is neither a simple nor perhaps a viable task.\n\nThis is not of course to say that our perspectives cannot be changed by such philosophical encounters. Ethical theory, particularly of the professedly radical sort that many ancient philosophers propounded, would hardly have a point if that were the case; and Cicero\u2019s project of communicating such theories would be equally unintelligible in that light. But coming to a theory from outside of any perspective is unintelligible. What Cicero\u2019s holding up of Epicurean ethics against the canvas of Roman tradition conveys is a point about how ethical theory in particular must conform, not so much to specific values and traditions, as to certain basic elements of what makes us human, without which it would be hard to discern how an ethical theory could have purchase on us at all: above all, perhaps, our status as social creatures shaped by our relation to specific histories and traditions.\n\nWhen it comes to Stoic theory, as laid out next by its spokesman Cato the Younger, things look more promising. Cato was historically the arch-defender of the traditional values of the Roman republic, while Stoicism, with its emphasis on the supremacy of virtue and the value of political participation, seems on the face of it to conform to the Roman way much more readily than Epicureanism does. Nonetheless, the stringency of Stoic theory, which holds that virtue is the only good thing, and vice the only bad thing, and takes virtue not to admit of degrees \u2013 without complete virtue one is not virtuous at all \u2013 allows Cicero to mount his critique.\n\nHe invites us to consider whether the Stoics have a theory which, in the terms they express it, can be proclaimed in those contexts that define the sphere of public life for a Roman: courts, assembly, Senate house, and battlefield. A lawyer, observes Cicero, could not credibly conclude the case for the defence by declaring that the punishments of exile and confiscation were not evils, but merely to be \u2018rejected\u2019 (the Stoic technical term for aversion toward things that nonetheless cannot affect one\u2019s happiness); nor could an orator announce, with Hannibal at the gates, that captivity, enslavement, and death were no evils (4.22). Moreover, the Senate would not be able to speak of Scipio Africanus\u2019 triumph as having been won by his valour, since he did not meet the standards of perfection required, in Stoic terms, for virtue (4.22).\n\nThis sort of objection seems especially damaging for the Stoics, with their emphasis on agency and public participation. In effect Cicero argues that the Stoics can have their integrity, or their theory, but not both. They cannot express their doctrines about virtue in public contexts without incurring ridicule or incomprehension. What they are left with, according to Cicero, is hypocrisy: the use of ordinary language in public, their own language in their writings (4.22).\n\nWhether or not Cicero is fair to the detail of Stoic and Epicurean ethics, his aim, as exemplified by the dialogical structure, is to provoke debate. In particular, his readers are invited to consider to what extent ethical theory must be answerable to social reality. Is not an ethical theory that cannot be lived consistently thereby flawed as a theory? In keeping with this question, Cicero moves next to a theory that seems on the face of it rather more congenial to lived experience, with an exposition by his interlocutor Piso of the ethics of the Old Academy, broadly in line with what we now think of as Aristotelian ethics.\n\nCrucially, this theory recognises a plurality of goods. Piso holds that virtue is sufficient for happiness but that there are also bodily goods such as health and freedom from pain, the possession of which, when added to virtue, will render the subject not just happy, as virtue on its own does, but \u2018supremely happy\u2019 (5.71). Cicero wonders whether treating such things as goods will not simply mean adopting the view of Aristotle\u2019s distinguished successor Theophrastus who, while providing a good deal of the resources for Piso\u2019s account (5.12), also acts as something of an outlier for having claimed that no life could be happy if caught up in pain or misfortune (5.77).\n\nCicero asks Piso to consider whether, even if one were to allow that a single misfortune might not affect the happiness of the virtuous, an accumulation of them would: could someone wracked by pain, disease, and other misfortunes plausibly be thought of as happy, let alone happiest? (5.84). Shrewdly turning against him the Aristotelian method of canvassing the views of both the many and the wise, to which Piso had appealed at 5.63 in support of his view of the supremacy of virtue, Cicero declares that ordinary folk would deny, and experts be unsure, that someone being tortured could be happy (5.85). Piso responds by giving a more worked-out \u2018lexical\u2019 account of the relation between virtue and the other goods, so as to underpin his view that virtue suffices for a happy (even if not for the happiest) life: the smallest amount of excellence of character is ranked ahead of all bodily goods; and no foul-but-pleasant action is better than any honourable-but-painful one (5.93). Virtue can thus be equated with happiness, while happiness can be enhanced through the addition of other goods (5.95).\n\nOne might think, however, that this theoretical tightening comes at a cost. The advantage of Piso\u2019s originally looser pluralism is that it accords with the views about value of those who, as Cicero puts it, have never come across a philosopher even in a painting (5.80). Piso is allowed to reiterate the criticism \u2013 indicating its importance for Cicero \u2013 that the Stoics adopt one set of terms in real life and another in the lecture room (5.89). But when Piso asks disapprovingly whether philosophers should speak in a different way from human beings (5.89), it is hard to avoid the thought that in his case the terminology of the street now dresses a more rigid substance. In becoming full-fledged theory, his discourse is in danger of losing what made it distinctive and attractive as an account of the good human life.\n\nCicero does not tell us which, if any, of the ethical theories that he discusses we should adopt. Matters are left explicitly unresolved at the close of On Ends (5.95\u20136). Cicero, however, not only offers us tools to think through the issues for ourselves, but in so doing, utilises the series of expositions and critiques that he lays out to raise pertinent questions, befitting the sceptical stance, about the status of ethical theory itself.\n\n6.3 Theology\n\nCicero\u2019s manifesto to write, in what proved to be his last period of literary production, encyclopedically about philosophy, is set out in the preface to his work of philosophical theology On the Nature of the Gods. The daunting task he sets himself is linked by him to the specific approach of the Academic sceptic. He cites with approval the example of Carneades, who by challenging Stoic theology aroused in people a desire to discover the truth (1.4). Cicero will take this one step further and aspire to examine critically all the relevant theories about the gods. His conception of a worthy philosophical encyclopedia is therefore much more than a dutiful trotting out of who thought what. His aim is to subject all available views to scrutiny.\n\nIn Cicero\u2019s view this approach fits the questions of theology particularly well, given the many and varied differences of opinion that exist about the nature of the gods. It may be, he declares, that none of the positions are correct; certainly, no more than one can be (1.5). The reader is thus put on notice that any view might in principle be overturned, and it is perhaps no surprise that Cicero says he will need to respond to critics who claim that sceptical philosophy, rather than providing illumination, \u2018floods things with darkness\u2019 (1.6).\n\nIn response, he says that upon the verdict reached about the nature of the gods will depend our assessment of the whole moral and material apparatus of religion, including by implication traditional Roman religion \u2013 indeed the examples he lists suggest that this is primarily what he has in mind (1.14). When he speaks, at the very start of the work, of its subject being one that was vital \u2018for the regulation of religion\u2019 (1.1), one might easily read that conservatively: we investigate the gods in order better to maintain the religious status quo. Now, however, it seems that our investigation is to be open, our sense of what (if any) is the correct religion awaiting the outcome of enquiry into the nature of the gods.\n\nThe greater part of Book 1 is given over to an exposition of Epicurean theology by Cicero\u2019s spokesman Velleius, followed by a critique from the work\u2019s representative of Academic scepticism, Cotta \u2013 Cicero also portrays a younger version of himself as holding mainly a listening brief at the discussion. Books 2 and 3 consist respectively of exposition (by Balbus) and critique (by Cotta) of Stoic theology, which, in stark contrast to the Epicurean version, has god managing the workings of the universe down to the smallest detail.\n\nThe Epicurean gods, on Velleius\u2019 telling, live a life of utter tranquility. They have no business to attend to; they simply take pleasure in their own wisdom and virtue, secure in the knowledge that their bliss will be everlasting (1.51). Since they have no troubles, they are not involved in the laborious business of creating or governing the universe, which arises and is sustained by the clustering of atoms in the void; they likewise have no concern with the travails of human life (1.52\u201354). This does not, however, mean that they are not rightly objects of piety and reverence: we worship the sublimity of their nature (1.56).\n\nWe can discern a coherent, if hardly uncontroversial, theological account here. Having previously criticised his opponents for not setting out a clear roster of divine attributes, Velleius is at pains to do that himself. The gods are, in a nutshell, immortal, beautiful and happy, with the corollaries of happiness meaning that they are virtuous and wise as well. Happiness is inconsistent with making or having trouble, so god is completely and everlastingly tranquil and at rest, enjoying the bliss of that state. Underlying this account is what one might call a negative principle: god must not exhibit any weakness or imperfection. If we now consider the maxim of Epicurus that Velleius cites about the blessed and eternal, its unfolding of what such a state implies is framed entirely negatively: it does not have troubles or make trouble for others, nor is it in the grip of anger or partiality since each is a sign of weakness (1.45). We might agree that the concept of god has to be that of a perfect being. And conceiving of perfection in terms of a lack of negative qualities is one way to substantiate what perfection might mean.\n\nThe Epicurean viewpoint also has implications for how we are to consider the relation between god and religion. Velleius\u2019 insistence on an anthropomorphic conception of god (1.46\u20138) is, in part, motivated by a desire to do justice to the traditional Greek picture of the gods \u2013 and, for that matter, the traditional Roman one, which shared an anthropomorphic conception with, and was deeply influenced by, the Greek inheritance. Equally, however, Velleius takes aim at traditional poetic representations of the gods as badly behaved humans on a larger scale. There is, in a correct conception of divinity, no place for war, strife, lust, anger or other violent emotions (1.42). And Velleius has little time for ordinary people\u2019s views about the gods, which he dismisses as \u2018mired in the greatest inconsistency through their ignorance of the truth\u2019 (1.43).\n\nCicero\u2019s agile use of the dialogue form is manifest in Cotta\u2019s response. He picks up on an aspect of the Epicurean method as Velleius had described it, namely that we must infer the existence of the gods from the fact that everyone has a conception (if often a distorted conception) that the gods exist. Cotta is happy for present purposes to grant the existence of god, while registering his dissatisfaction with both the idea that the belief is universally held, and the notion that, if it were, this would justify inferring its truth.\n\nHowever, Cotta also says that while it might be difficult to deny the existence of the gods in a public assembly, it should be easy to do so in the sort of meeting they are currently having (1.61). He later adds the thesis that anthropomorphic gods were either thought up by philosophers to encourage ordinary people to turn from vice to worship or were a product of a superstition that considered that the worship of concrete images allowed access to the gods themselves (1.77). He then presses the idea that the non-interventionist gods of the Epicureans are fatal to religion (1.116\u20137, 1.121), while characterising under the same heading, as \u2018utterly destructive of religion\u2019, those who claim that the notion of immortal gods is a fiction invented by the wise to lead people unsusceptible to reason to do, through religion, their duty (1.118). Cotta does not say that this analysis of the origin of the gods is incorrect; rather, he implies that its public dissemination would undermine the very aim that the analysis posits as an explanation.\n\nWe are back to the question of the relation between one\u2019s theory and one\u2019s public pronouncements. On this occasion, Cotta\u2019s own stance may seem both cynical and hypocritical: to maintain social order one must suppress one\u2019s own views, while reserving frankness for private gatherings of the philosophically minded. Yet here the formal difference between Cicero the author and Cotta the character is important. If, within the dramatic setting of On the Nature of the Gods, the gathering is indeed as Cotta describes, its embedding in a written work that Cicero intends to be read more widely blurs the line between private and public on which the charge of hypocrisy rests. If Cotta can be convicted of hypocrisy, it is less clear that Cicero is open to the same charge. He has let the cat out of the bag, and in so doing raised the vital question, for any reader, of the extent to which unrestricted frankness of speech can co-exist with the maintenance of social order.\n\nThe Stoic theology expounded next by Balbus seems less immediately vulnerable to these practical concerns; here there is a parallel with the respective treatments of the schools\u2019 ethical theories in On Ends. Indeed, while Velleius relied on a relatively technical and abstract approach in his exposition of the Epicurean view, Balbus offers in Stoicism a theology that seems targeted rather specifically at a Roman audience, and this in two distinct ways. First, the less technical presentation encourages readers who are unwilling or unable to enter the more tangled thickets of philosophical theory to engage with the basic ideas. Second, it promises to appeal to a Roman sense of specialness and pride in their nation by portraying the gods themselves as certifying that attitude through the interest they take in the wellbeing of Rome.\n\nThus, having separated out \u2018our [Roman] people\u2019 as bearers of the belief in gods\u2019 existence, Balbus proceeds to declare that the ever-increasing strength (as he sees it) of religious belief is no accident given the way the gods have concretely manifested their power. He then cites examples, from both distant and more recent Roman military history, of gods seen fighting on the side of Rome, or acting as messengers of Roman victory (2.6). He follows this up with tales of how divine premonitions were sent by the gods to warn Rome away from impending disaster, with dire consequences when they were ignored (2.7\u20138).\n\nIn fact, Balbus\u2019 lengthy speech both begins and ends with the placing of Rome at the forefront of divine providence. Towards the close of his speech, having argued for the thesis that the care of the gods is, to be sure, directed at the whole human race (2.164), he then gradually zooms in, first to the specific regions of the world, with Europe listed first; then to particular cities, with Rome listed first; and finally to individuals, all of whom happen to be Romans who achieved significant military success (2.165), though there is a nod to Greece and the Homeric heroes to bring up the rear.\n\nHence, in terms of the structure of his speech, one of the chief points of theological doctrine that distinguishes the Stoic view from the Epicurean \u2013 namely that the gods are concerned with human wellbeing and actively promote it \u2013 becomes, in Balbus\u2019 hands, the notion that this providential outlook has Rome not as its exclusive but certainly as its primary focus. On the face of it, this seems like a shrewd strategy: a Roman audience is, perhaps, more likely to be won over by an account that shows the gods as Rome\u2019s best friend than by one that shuns any notion of divine favour.\n\nYet there is also, from the point of view of the dramatic context, something peculiar about this approach. Balbus, it is true, is conversing with a group of staunch Romans. But they are also Romans whose philosophical sophistication has been emphasised. Is recounting tales of divine support for the Roman enterprise really the best way to persuade such an audience of the truth of one\u2019s philosophical position? The short answer, of course, is that Cicero\u2019s intended audience is wider and no doubt on average less philosophically sophisticated than the interlocutors at the scene. But there is a bit more going on than this.\n\nIn Book 1 Velleius\u2019 lucidity of exposition was pointedly contrasted by Cotta with more typical Epicurean obscurity (notably in Epicurus himself) in a way that seemed to warn that change of style does not necessarily leave substance untouched. Balbus in turn speaks of the advantages of his own full and rich style over the more compressed argumentative method found in the Stoic theoreticians, in particular Stoicism\u2019s founder Zeno of Citium. But he does so in a way calculated by Cicero to raise our suspicions: my style of presentation, says Balbus, flows like a river; and just as flowing rivers avoid being polluted much better than do enclosed pools, so too my stream of eloquence will dilute a critic\u2019s protestations, while a closely reasoned argument cannot so easily protect itself (2.20).\n\nThis is surely intended by Cicero to seem disquieting. If arguments need a cloak of rhetorical eloquence to save them from refutation, then the ideas in support of which those arguments are advanced might, on reflection, appear less, not more, convincing. Balbus then gives a brief list of some of Zeno\u2019s succinct deductive arguments in favour of the universe being intelligent, wise, happy and eternal, and therefore divine (2.21). So even as Balbus tells us that a more flowing presentation has a better chance of evading the \u2018calumnies\u2019 of the Academic critics (2.20), we as readers are offered the chance by Cicero to exercise our critical judgement on some concrete arguments, while reflecting, in equally critical vein, on the issue of how philosophy can be communicated without either the alienation of excessive technicality or the distortion of an overly smooth rhetoric.\n\nThe issue is then shown to have particular pertinence when religion is to the forefront. In his response to Balbus, Cotta, who also held the Roman office of priest, picks up on Balbus\u2019 plea, at the end of Book 2, that Cotta support Stoic doctrine, by asserting that by this was no doubt meant that he should uphold the ancestral beliefs about the gods and about religious practice \u2013 and, he adds, no discourse will ever turn him away from such beliefs (3.5). As a Roman aristocrat of distinguished ancestry and as a priest, it behooves Cotta to accept ancestral precedent even without rational argument; but, since Balbus is a philosopher, the latter ought to give such argument in defence of his claims (3.6). For Cotta, ancestral authority suffices for his belief that the gods exist (3.7, 3.9), whereas Balbus, since he \u2018despises authority\u2019, must fight using reason alone. So, in responding to him, Cotta will pitch his own reason against Balbus\u2019 (3.9).\n\nIt seems rather alarming that Cotta the avowed sceptic should tell us that he accepts positions on authority rather than through reason and imply that he (unlike Balbus) is no philosopher. One has some sympathy with Balbus\u2019 riposte that, if Cotta is already convinced that the gods exist, why should he want anything from him? (3.7). Of course, Cotta as a proponent of scepticism is prepared to use the weapons of reason against a philosopher. But one suspects that there is more to his disclaimers than a sly false modesty designed to provoke Balbus. We might think that appeal to authority is, in the religious case, very much to the point.\n\nReligions are not free-floating products of reason. They are based on tradition and the establishment of authority. Tradition of course is itself a product of evolution over time. But once something can be talked of as a religion, it already has in place structures and a history that can be seen to be reasonably deep-rooted and which, although it can evolve, must retain a sense of connection with those roots. In the religious context, tradition rather than reason is the principal authority, whether that be located in founding figures or documents, in time-honoured ceremonies and rituals, or in leaders who can claim to inherit the mantle of authority via their own devotion to the tradition \u2013 in the Roman context, the high priests whom Cotta affirms that he defers to on religious matters, rather than Stoic theorists (3.5).\n\nCotta has put his finger on something important about the role of authority in religion. If one calls the authority of tradition into question, then one risks having no religion left. And if one of the purposes of religion is, from a practical point of view \u2013 both in the Roman context and surely more widely \u2013 the promotion of a sense of social cohesion and communal identity, then to challenge tradition is to threaten those objectives. So Cotta\u2019s remarks on authority are not an evasion of Balbus\u2019 closing challenge, but an acknowledgement of what it means to have a religious commitment in the first place. Cotta\u2019s position here has plausibly been seen (Wynne 2019, 167) as an inspiration for fideism, the view that faith or tradition is a justificatory source of religious belief independent of reason.\n\nWe might nonetheless wonder whether Cotta can compartmentalise things so straightforwardly as to be governed by tradition from the point of view of his religious and Roman identity, and by reason when it comes to philosophical discourse. Here Cotta\u2019s implication that he is not a philosopher perhaps recognises something crucial about the nature of reason. The problem is not exactly that one might have different approaches in different contexts; in principle, that might be a perfectly sensible way to proceed. It is, rather, that if one demonstrates by reason that, for example, the gods do not exist, then the gods do not exist. Reason is not a compartment in which one can store a certain set of beliefs or conclusions that need not carry over to other areas of one\u2019s life. It is an integral part of the claim of reason that its claim is a universal one.\n\nThe tension between reason and tradition is not, then, to be resolved simply by carving out, for example, separate spaces for religion on the one hand and philosophy on the other. At the same time religion itself has something important to tell us about the nature of belief. When Cotta scoffs at Balbus\u2019 assertion, from his main speech, that the tales of gods appearing to us in human form provide evidence of their existence, Balbus responds by saying that surely ancient authority must carry some weight with Cotta. To this Cotta replies, along previous lines, that Balbus is offering \u2018hearsay when what I ask for is reason\u2019 (3.13). Balbus, as before, owes Cotta a rational defence of Stoic claims even if Cotta\u2019s own beliefs do not, and are apparently not required to, rest on such a defence.\n\nThis contrast between beliefs based on hearsay and on rational justification invites us to consider what it would be like if the latter were given the unrestricted scope that it seems to demand. Cotta\u2019s hiving off to the realm of the philosopher the task of giving rational explanations suggests that the role of reason might, in fact, have its limits. If, for example, rational justification were the only acceptable basis for holding a belief, it is difficult to imagine that one would hold many, or any, beliefs at all. Certainly, many if not most of our beliefs are ones that we simply find ourselves with \u2013 acquired on the authority of \u2018hearsay\u2019, whether that be parents, friends, books, teachers, religious leaders, public figures, or any other source that may not necessarily have offered a strict rational justification for claims that we come to believe.\n\nNow the beliefs that we do come to hold can then be subject to rational scrutiny; this notion is at the core of the sceptical approach that Cotta, and of course Cicero himself, espouse. But to make sense even of this it seems that we have to take some beliefs as given in order to find a perspective from which to rationally assess others. A project in which all one\u2019s beliefs are simultaneously subject to the test of rational justification is incoherent. And from a practical point of view, if we only acted on the basis of those beliefs that had been subject to, and survived, rational scrutiny, we would scarcely act at all.\n\nIf so, then it is not simply a case of religion deferring to reason. Beliefs we hold without the legitimation of reason have a necessary place. The upshot seems to be that religious beliefs, insofar as they either are not or cannot be subject to rational defence, are more representative than one might have supposed of the beliefs we hold more generally. In this regard, On the Nature of the Gods is not uncharacteristic of Cicero\u2019s whole approach to philosophy: he uses his characters\u2019 debates both to advertise the virtues of rational enquiry, and to suggest that those virtues reach right the way up, as perhaps they should, to the status of rational enquiry itself.\n\n7. Cicero and Bernard Williams\n\nThere is no space here to explore in any detail the question of Cicero\u2019s later reception. The influence of his philosophical approach on his great eighteenth-century successor, David Hume, particularly in matters of theology and religion, is, however, well-documented (see e.g. Fosl 1994, Stuart-Buttle 2020). So it seems appropriate instead to juxtapose that approach, albeit briefly, with the work of one of the most noted Anglophone philosophers of the twentieth century, Bernard Williams. Insofar as there are discernible points of contact between the two thinkers, readers may be in a better position to \u2018place\u2019 Cicero\u2019s philosophical project which, in its context of Roman politics and Hellenistic philosophical debate, is liable to appear a little recondite to contemporary eyes.\n\nLike Williams, then, Cicero engages deeply with his philosophical predecessors not principally as a historical exercise but as a creative way of doing, and communicating, philosophy. Like Williams, he is concerned to explore the scope and limits of philosophical theory, especially ethical theory, in relation to the character of lived human experience. Both thinkers take the view that theory tends to fall short in accounting for how one should live in practical contexts and for the place of integrity in an agent\u2019s life. Each combines a belief in the power of philosophy to illuminate with a marked scepticism about some of the claims that philosophy makes for itself. Not unconnectedly, the two thinkers show great care in the way they write philosophy; both evince a distaste for technicality for its own sake.\n\nIt is an irony in the history of philosophy that Williams himself, during a discussion of ancient scepticism, refers to Cicero, in passing, as a \u2018third-rate\u2019 thinker (2006, 33). If the affinities with Williams sketched here are anywhere near the mark, readers may be motivated to explore, by engaging with Cicero\u2019s philosophical work themselves, whether that verdict is entirely just."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cicero", "page_content": "In the months following Julius Caesar \u2019s assassination in 44 BCE, Marcus Tullius Cicero delivered several speeches that urged the Senate to support Octavian in his struggle against Mark Antony . When Octavian and Antony reconciled, a centurion murdered Cicero on Antony\u2019s order. Cicero\u2019s head and hands were nailed to the rostra in the Roman Forum.\n\nIn his youth, Marcus Tullius Cicero was instructed by the famed rhetorician Molon of Rhodes. Molon did not stick to any one style, instead drifting between florid and concise language. Cicero perfected this methodology, relying on cadence, emotion, and the energy of his audience and interweaving references to literature, philosophy, and history.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero resented the political machinations of Julius Caesar , Pompey , and Marcus Licinius Crassus and initially refused to ally himself with them, even attempting to isolate Pompey from Caesar. However, he later committed himself publicly\u2014if not personally\u2014to their advancement before diminishing his political involvement during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.\n\nIn 63 BCE Marcus Tullius Cicero gave an impassioned oration to his fellow senators that charged Catiline with plotting to stage a violent coup. This so moved the Senate that they voted to implement martial law and execute the conspirators. Cicero was named pater patriae\u2014\u201cfather of the country\u201d\u2014for his service to the republic.\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero was a masterful orator known for his ability to evoke a wide range of emotions in plebeians and patricians alike. Cicero\u2019s political career saw him as quaestor , praetor , consul , and proconsul , providing him with several opportunities to influence the trajectory of Rome and the Senate in the waning days of the republic.\n\nCicero , in full Marcus Tullius Cicero , (born 106 bce, Arpinum, Latium [now Arpino, Italy]\u2014died December 7, 43 bce, Formiae , Latium [now Formia]), Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and writer who vainly tried to uphold republican principles in the final civil wars that destroyed the Roman Republic . His writings include books of rhetoric , orations, philosophical and political treatises , and letters. He is remembered in modern times as the greatest Roman orator and the innovator of what became known as Ciceronian rhetoric.\n\nIn the first of his consular speeches, he opposed the agrarian bill of Servilius Rullus, in the interest of the absent Pompey; but his chief concern was to discover and make public the seditious intentions of Catiline, who, defeated in 64, appeared again at the consular elections in 63 (over which Cicero presided, wearing armour beneath his toga). Catiline lost and planned to carry out armed uprisings in Italy and arson in Rome. Cicero had difficulty in persuading the Senate of the danger, but the \u201clast decree\u201d (Senatus consultum ultimum), something like a proclamation of martial law , was passed on October 22. On November 8, after escaping an attempt on his life, Cicero delivered the first speech against Catiline in the Senate, and Catiline left Rome that night. Evidence incriminating the conspirators was secured and, after a senatorial debate in which Cato the Younger spoke for execution and Julius Caesar against, they were executed on Cicero\u2019s responsibility. Cicero, announcing their death to the crowd with the single word vixerunt (\u201cthey are dead\u201d), received a tremendous ovation from all classes, which inspired his subsequent appeal in politics to concordia ordinum, \u201cconcord between the classes.\u201d He was hailed by Catulus as \u201cfather of his country.\u201d This was the climax of his career.\n\nCicero was the son of a wealthy family of Arpinum . Admirably educated in Rome and in Greece , he did military service in 89 under Pompeius Strabo (the father of the statesman and general Pompey ) and made his first appearance in the courts defending Publius Quinctius in 81. His brilliant defense, in 80 or early 79, of Sextus Roscius against a fabricated charge of parricide established his reputation at the bar, and he started his public career as quaestor (an office of financial administration) in western Sicily in 75.\n\nAlliance with the First Triumvirate\n\nAt the end of 60, Cicero declined Caesar\u2019s invitation to join the political alliance of Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey, the so-called First Triumvirate, which he considered unconstitutional, and also Caesar\u2019s offer in 59 of a place on his staff in Gaul. When Publius Clodius, whom Cicero had antagonized by speaking and giving evidence against him when he was tried for profanity early in 61, became tribune in 58, Cicero was in danger, and in March, disappointed by Pompey\u2019s refusal to help him, he fled Rome. On the following day Clodius carried a bill forbidding the execution of a Roman citizen without trial. Clodius then carried through a second law, of doubtful legality, declaring Cicero an exile. Cicero went first to Thessalonica, in Macedonia, and then to Illyricum. In 57, thanks to the activity of Pompey and particularly the tribune Titus Annius Milo, he was recalled on August 4. Cicero landed at Brundisium (Brindisi) on that day and was acclaimed all along his route to Rome, where he arrived a month later.\n\nIn winter 57\u201356 Cicero attempted unsuccessfully to estrange Pompey from Caesar. Pompey disregarded Cicero\u2019s advice and renewed his compact with Caesar and Crassus at Luca in April 56. Cicero then agreed, under pressure from Pompey, to align himself with the three in politics, and he committed himself in writing to this effect (the \u201cpalinode\u201d). The speech De provinciis consularibus (On the Consular Provinces) marked his new alliance. He was obliged to accept a number of distasteful defenses, and he abandoned public life. In the next few years he completed the De oratore (55; On the Orator) and De republica (52; On the Republic) and began the De legibus (52; On Laws). In 52 he was delighted when Milo killed Clodius but failed disastrously in his defense of Milo (later written for publication, the Pro Milone, or For Milo).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The province had been expecting a Parthian invasion, but it never materialized, although Cicero did suppress some brigands on Mt. Amanus. The Senate granted a supplicatio (a period of public thanksgiving), although Cicero had hoped for a triumph, a processional return through the city, on his return to Rome. All admitted that he governed Cilicia with integrity.\n\nBy the time Cicero returned to Rome, Pompey and Caesar were struggling against each other for complete power. He was on the outskirts of Rome when Caesar crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy in January 49. Cicero met Pompey outside Rome on January 17 and accepted a commission to supervise recruiting in Campania. He did not leave Italy with Pompey on March 17, however. His indecision was not discreditable, though his criticism of Pompey\u2019s strategy was inexpert. In an interview with Caesar on March 28, Cicero showed great courage in stating his own terms\u2014his intention of proposing in the Senate that Caesar should not pursue the war against Pompey any further\u2014though they were terms that Caesar could not possibly accept. Cicero disapproved of Caesar\u2019s dictatorship; yet he realized that in the succession of battles (which continued until 45) he would have been one of the first victims of Caesar\u2019s enemies, had they triumphed. This was his second period of intensive literary production, works of this period including the Brutus, Paradoxa Stoicorum (Paradoxes of the Stoics), and Orator (The Orator) in 46; De finibus (On the Supreme Good) in 45; and Tusculanae disputationes (Tusculan Disputations), De natura deorum (On the Nature of the Gods), and De officiis (On Duties), finished after Caesar\u2019s murder, in 44."}]}
