During the six years since Dragonette\u2019s last recording, 2016\u2019s \u201cRoyal Blues,\u201d Sorbara experienced the final dissolution of the original creative partnership at the heart of Dragonette, the start of a new romantic relationship and the subsequent birth of her first child followed by the further life-disrupting chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, all the while wrestling with what form her musical career would take in the future.\n\nAll this upheaval audibly informs what might just be Dragonette\u2019s finest album yet, a mature, three-dimensional pop offering that grapples with the simultaneous terror and thrilling potential of Big Change before confidently accepting that sometimes Big Change is the only way forward.\n\n\u201cDragonette was on the gurney,\u201d admitted Sorbara over a post-rehearsal pint at her local microbrewery in the Roncesvalles neighbourhood. \u201cI was just, like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna go make some music and we\u2019ll defibrillate you if we need you. I\u2019m gonna go make this record and we\u2019ll see what it is and then maybe we\u2019ll take you off life support.\u2019 And then I was, like, \u2018No, no. I have to.\u2019 Because now Dragonette feels like mine.\u201d\n\nIt seems odd that Sorbara, 43, would be nervous about carrying Dragonette \u2014 which she formed with her ex-husband, Dan Kurtz, 15 years ago \u2014 ahead as a solo act since she began performing and recording as a solo act when she was just 16.\n\nBut once she and Kurtz decided, after making \u201cRoyal Blues\u201d together six years ago despite their recent separation, to part ways creatively, as well, it took her some time to claim the name and the legacy of Dragonette as her own. And also to realize that she was now in a position to do whatever she wanted with it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to wrap up shop. I was doing well just floating around the world writing with other people, doing collaborations,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d started writing for other artists, and I love collaborating and I love writing and I love releasing music. It was just the idea of having to put something that\u2019s just mine behind my name and being the only person in the picture.\u201d\n\nA series of encounters with potential label suitors didn\u2019t help her disenchantment, as A&R professionals offered Sorbara \u2014 whose done just fine penning top-shelf pop fodder in the past with the likes of Martin Solveig and Kaskade, as well as for other artists such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Keith Urban \u2014 guidance towards the future in the form of radio-ready playlists that really didn\u2019t sit comfortably with her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to diss what\u2019s on the radio but it just was, like, \u2018If I\u2019m supposed to try to get on the radio, I don\u2019t want to make music anymore,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018Music used to be better and now it sucks.\u2019 I just don\u2019t want to make that. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just not for me. Maybe I aged out of it. I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even like it was bad music. It was just, like, \u2018No, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 My soul just reacted in a way where I thought \u2018If that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do, maybe I\u2019m not a band anymore because I don\u2019t want to do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nA fortunate encounter with producer Dan Farber, who\u2019s worked with Lizzo and Dizzee Rascal in the past, during a \u201crandom\u201d writing trip to Los Angeles proved to be the catalyst for \u201cTwennies\u201d \u2014 even if it took Sorbara some time to wake up to that fact.\n\nOne of the first tunes the two wrote together was the sweet, bossa nova-tinged ballad \u201cThis Is All You Get,\u201d yet at the time of its creation Sorbara deemed it a bad fit for Dragonette. Yet as time moved on, it dawned on her that now that Dragonette was just her, Dragonette could sound like whatever the hell she wanted Dragonette to sound like. She could even re-embrace her \u201cinner Ani DiFranco\u201d and take the music in directions that hearken back to her formative years as a folk singer/songwriter. Farber was a willing co-conspirator.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so amazing. I\u2019ve worked with so many people over the last 10 years when I started just walking in with strangers or whatever,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never made a musical connection where all of a sudden you\u2019re speaking a creative language with such easy flow and there\u2019s no weird judginess and I\u2019m not going to censor anything and that was how it was from the very beginning. We wrote that song and I was, like, \u2018Too bad it\u2019s not Dragonette.\u2019 But with time and space and feeling like I could do whatever I want, it went from being \u2018I can do whatever I want. This has to be a Dragonette record and this is how I make this thing mine.\u2019 It was a thing I had to do to own the past 15 years of my life.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cTwennies\u201d thrown out to the world at large on Oct. 28, Dragonette returns to a Toronto stage on Thursday at the Axis Club. It\u2019s one of only a handful of gigs she\u2019s done since the last record, but the first \u2014 a trip to the Planet Pride celebrations in Brooklyn last summer which she almost cancelled at the last minute \u2014 gave her inner confirmation that she was capable of claiming Dragonette as her own.\n\nAfter performing the worldwide smash \u201cHello,\u201d a 2010 collaboration with DJ/producer Solveig that was back on the Billboard charts this year thanks to its inclusion in the TV series \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d before the Planet Pride crowd Sorbara wandered around and heard \u201cHello,\u201d her Kaskade cut \u201cFire In Your New Shoes\u201d and her Galantis co-write \u201cPeanut Butter Jelly\u201d being spun to delirious crowds by other DJs. It was a welcome boost of confidence.\n\n\u201cI wrote all these songs but I\u2019d never in my life allowed myself to feel that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like something happening outside of me and I couldn\u2019t take ownership of it and, for some reason, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because now Dragonette is me and it\u2019s mine I feel myself more holistically in this thing and I\u2019m like \u2018Wow, I did all those things.\u2019 And those songs are living on. \u2018Hello\u2019 was on the top of the f---ing Billboard charts this year. That\u2019s a f---ing classic.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point is not tooting my own horn or saying \u2018Look at all this sh--- I did,\u2019 but for the past 10 years I never took ownership of it. I just flew down there by myself. I had no entourage. I was a floater. And then I got up onstage and I sang for the first performance and something about the aloneness of me there, I think, made me realize all of a sudden \u2018Oh, I had to do this.\u2019 I woke up to my autonomy and my ownership of all this stuff and then I kept hearing my songs and all of a sudden I owned them and I was me.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.celebsagewiki.com/martina-sorbara", "page_content": "Age, Biography and Wiki\n\nMartina Sorbara was born on 13 November, 1978 in Toronto, Canada, is a Canadian singer-songwriter.

It peaked at #112 in the UK Singles chart."}, {"url": "https://macleans.ca/culture/its-all-about-them/", "page_content": "Pop history suggests that husband and wife singer-songwriter teams tend to have far from enviable relationships. While they were amusing to watch, there was about as much sexual chemistry between Sonny and Cher as a Saturday morning cartoon. Arcade Fire\u2019s main vocalists, the married Win Butler and R\u00e9gine Chassagne, have made extraordinary indie rock in their two-disc career, but when they sing together you imagine their social life to be as much fun as a Chekhov novel. For every romantic June Carter and Johnny Cash, there are love stories \u00e0 la Ike and Tina Turner and Courtney Love and Kurt Cobain with enough issues to make musicians swear off dating one another for good.\n\nMartina Sorbara and Dan Kurtz of the Canadian electropop group Dragonette, on the other hand, are lucky enough to have the type of passionate bond that translates well from real life to on-record. Ever since their first album, Galore, was released by Universal Music Canada in 2007, the happily married twosome has been giving fans a peek into their relationship, war wounds and all, via their music. Their debut album\u2019s vampy first single, I Get Around, may extol the glories of a one-night stand but it was their successful second and third singles Take It Like A Man and Competition from Galore that really put a magnifying glass to Kurtz\u2019s and Sorbara\u2019s private life. It\u2019s a formula that has made Bj\u00f6rk a supporter of the band, moved Kanye West to blog about them and prompted Cyndi Lauper, who has written and recorded with the pair, to crown Dragonette \u201cthe future of pop music.\u201d\n\nFor those who haven\u2019t yet caught up with the group or haven\u2019t a clue about their history, two things may come as a surprise. 1) Martina, 30, is the daughter of Greg Sorbara, former minister of finance for Ontario and a current Liberal MPP for the province, and 2) Galore was named one of the best albums of the year in 2007 by the fickle pop music website, Popjustice, which helped the band get a Juno nomination the following year.\n\nSitting in the rooftop bar at Toronto\u2019s Park Hyatt hotel on an evening in June, the day after West devoted a post to them on his website, Sorbara and Kurtz attempt to explain themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely not the same group that we were when we opened up for Scissor Sisters, New Order and Duran Duran [in 2005], \u201d Kurtz begins, eager to explain the thinking behind their upcoming sophomore album, Fixin To Thrill (to be released Sept. 29). Before Kurtz finishes his thought, though, he is interrupted by his wife, who blurts out, \u201cWhat he means is we\u2019re a lot tougher and more aggressive.\u201d She throws her fist into his shoulder for effect.\n\n\u201cI feel like Galore was the pretty album,\u201d she continues, speaking in an endearingly high voice while locking eyes with Kurtz. \u201cIt was girly and feminine and sweet. For Fixin To Thrill, I\u2019ve cut my hair really short, de-censored myself, stopped taking advice on how to write the quote-unquote universal pop song and now . . .\u201d she breathes before finishing, \u201cit sounds like a tomboy wearing high heels\u2014it\u2019s much more us.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cus\u201d Sorbara is talking about is drummer Joel Stouffer and guitarist Chris Huggett as well as Kurtz, yet it\u2019s easy to understand why the group is often mistaken for a duo. Watching Sorbara and Kurtz (who acts as the band\u2019s leader and producer) flirt with each other on stage, argue passionately in interviews and then harmonize in the studio, the magnetism is powerful. Then there\u2019s the frankness of personality-driven tracks such as True Believer (from Galore) and Stupid Grin (from Fixin To Thrill). It all explains why Dragonette sticks out in a sea of slick media-trained pop groups.\n\n\u201cWhen you listen closely to our lyrics, you find out way too much about me and Martina,\u201d says the 37-year-old Kurtz, who is known in the Canadian music scene as one of the founding members of acclaimed live electronic band the New Deal. Before forming Dragonette with Sorbara, Kurtz produced Feist\u2019s first album, Monarch, and co-produced Sarah Slean\u2019s bestselling disc to date, Day One. \u201cI may have a bias as her husband, but out of all the women I\u2019ve worked with, I believe she has the potential to reach the same type of success as Alanis or Sarah McLachlan\u2014she has an innate, sometimes brutal sense of honesty.\u201d\n\nThe pair weren\u2019t on totally honest ground when they first met, at a music festival more than seven years ago. Kurtz was already in a long-term relationship with someone when he began an affair with Sorbara\u2014then an acoustic-guitar-wielding folkster who made what she now refers to as \u201ctampon music.\u201d The result of their liaison was an ugly breakup, a fast marriage (\u201cwe were so in a rush to make it official,\u201d says Kurtz), and a campy Sorbara-penned single called Competition with the lyrics: \u201cYour girlfriend\u2019s got competition / goodness I like this / being your mistress.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur new songs such as Pick Up The Phone and Stupid Grin are much more indicative of our [six-year] marriage,\u201d Kurtz explains. \u201cWe like to think of our music as free couples\u2019 therapy. It\u2019s a time where you love and hate your partner at the same time so your feelings become more complicated. We make sure that all goes into our work.\u201d\n\nSorbara says she sees a need for meaty pop songs that come from \u201creal life rather than a team of hit producers.\u201d In fact, when Sorbara is asked to remark on a recent comment posting on YouTube\u2014\u201cwhen I hear [Dragonette] play live, I feel like I am in a threesome with them\u201d\u2014she lights up. \u201cThat makes me feel good because I don\u2019t write fiction, and I do think part of a good show is giving the crowd that kind of intensity and intimacy,\u201d she says. \u201cI prefer [listeners] to know about my life rather than backward, boring messages like Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Put A Ring On It. It\u2019s a song I love to listen to but I hate the lyrics. I\u2019m also really impressed by Lady Gaga, but I wish she had smarter lines than \u2018I want to take a ride on your disco stick.\u2019 \u201d\n\nComments like these can make Sorbara come off as the electro music scene\u2019s answer to Camille Paglia. Her appearance\u2014a cross between Joan of Arc and a young Isabella Rossellini\u2014drives the message home loud and clear: Sorbara is fatigued by all the Pussycat Dolls-style pop on the charts and wants to do something about it. \u201cPop like that reminds me of movies like He\u2019s Just Not That Into You and Sex and the City,\u201d she says, \u201cfilms where women are running around town like chickens with their heads cut off trying to get a man. I want to offer the antithesis to that.\u201d\n\nOn Fixin To Thrill, Sorbara\u2019s voice is anything but weak. \u201cThinking for myself / I\u2019ll be the only one,\u201d she sings in Easy, poking fun at the tired notion of the traditional pop diva. \u201cI am a feminist and think women in pop music don\u2019t all have to be these clean prima donna princesses or cheesy sexpots,\u201d she offers. \u201cI can be glamorous and still keep my armpit hair. As the art director and the stylist for Dragonette, I have to make sure our image is raw and means something, just like our music, or what\u2019s the point?\u201d\n\nA perfect example of Sorbara\u2019s progressive point of view is reflected in one of Dragonette\u2019s B-sides from Fixin To Thrill\u2014a track called My Things that touches on her and Kurtz\u2019s wicked sense of humour. The chorus includes the line \u201cget your titties off my things.\u201d It\u2019s a song Sorbara says was written as a lighthearted warning. \u201cIt\u2019s about all these groupies lusting over guys with guitars. I am playfully singing to all those girls offering their [breasts] to Dan when we are on tour. Believe me, I have seen a lot of those hussies!\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly scandalous compared to Shakira or Rihanna\u2019s songs. I\u2019m just taking ownership of my relationship.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if her father has heard the song (an article in the Globe and Mail in 2007 reported he had implored Martina not to use the \u201cT\u201d word in interviews anymore), Sorbara shakes her head and offers up a theory. \u201cAt this point my parents have come to expect the unexpected with me. I hope he thinks the song is kind of smart because it\u2019s so macho. I\u2019m turning the tables here. It may not be his style of music but I think they\u2019d both chuckle,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, I grew up creating handmade guitars in a hippie community in the mountains in Winlaw, B.C., and on a farm outside of Toronto, so what do you expect?\u201d\n\nSorbara\u2019s fierce way of communicating seems to be getting attention. She\u2019s currently working on a song for Leona Lewis\u2019s new album, and was asked to collaborate on a track with Parisian dance DJ Martin Solveig for Jean Paul Gaultier\u2019s newest fragrance Ma Dame. In the video for the dance track, Sorbara shares screen time with the legendary French designer, who had her styled in his latest fall/winter collection. \u201cIt made sense for us,\u201d she says. \u201cGaultier\u2019s aesthetic suits me. His view of women is very powerful and the opposite of demure.\u201d\n\nAs for the pair\u2019s future plans, Dragonette is \u201cnot looking for world domination,\u201d Sorbara jokes. \u201cI just want me and Dan to be able to continue to make pop music that\u2019s subversive and tour the world together like we are still on a honeymoon.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/martina-sorbara-mn0000312515/discography", "page_content": "Discography Martina Sorbara Follow Artist +\n\nCanada has long been known for raising amazing female singer-songwriters.

Martina is a graduate of the Toronto Waldorf School in Thornhill.\n\nContents\n\nHer debut album, Unplaceables, was released independently in 1998 and is no longer in print.\n\nSorbara's second album, The Cure for Bad Deeds, was released independently in 2000. An expanded version of the album appeared on MapleMusic Recordings in 2002. Both versions of the album were produced by Jian Ghomeshi.

All that changed with the lockdown in March 2020, when Dragonette, Sorbara\u2019s indie-pop project, was put on hold, and Vitiello, founder of elevated-takeout-rotisserie-chicken joint Flock Rotisserie + Greens, faced a wave of heartbreaking April cancellations, including Biblio Bash, the Toronto Public Library fundraiser with his catering partner 10Tation, and his annual fundraising dinner for children\u2019s cancer charity Camp Ooch at Cactus Club Caf\u00e9, where he is head of culinary development for Toronto.\n\nBut the silver lining has been the extra time at home with their son. Right now, Barlow is learning to talk (\u201cHe calls me \u2018hon\u2019 and \u2018babe,\u2019\u201d Sorbara says with a laugh), and he graduated early from potty training, which the couple initiated once they realized that their normally packed schedules had dramatically freed up.\n\nIt\u2019s created plenty of time for lazy Sundays. \u201cWe\u2019ve made Sundays about us,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so special. We lock ourselves in, do our crosswords and cook.\u201d On a typical weekend, the family will get up early and go for a stroll through High Park or Roncesvalles Village. They\u2019re regulars at the Roncy caf\u00e9 Reunion Island, sometimes scooping up a legendary breakfast sandwich from the Gold Standard takeout window. \u201cThey treat Barlow like a VIP,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nVitiello, a chef since he was 15, spent most Sundays during the first two decades of his 25-year career working hectic shifts in kitchens. After closing his acclaimed Harbord Room restaurant in 2016, his life changed. Now, in contrast to the harried pace of a restaurant kitchen, Vitiello savours the slower speed of cooking at home. He starts the day by picking up fresh ingredients from local merchants, such as fish market Hooked or Roncesvalles produce stand Ko Fruit Market.\n\nThough veggies and fish are usually the core ingredients of his mains, a high-quality cut of meat constitutes a special Sunday treat. Braised meats, especially short ribs, have been a favourite comfort food over the winter. While Sorbara is a pescatarian, Vitiello says he has \u201cno problem spending the whole Sunday cooking this braise that could feed 15 people, even though there is only one person in the house who eats it.\u201d Thankfully, it\u2019s not hard to find some outside assistance. \u201cI usually take some to the neighbours [as a] surprise,\u201d he says.\n\nSorbara is a whiz in the kitchen, too, whipping up pastries to satisfy Vitiello\u2019s sweet tooth. She\u2019s happiest, however, spending a cosy Sunday working away on a crossword, a pastime Vitiello has picked up as well, along with his Sudoku habit.\n\nSorbara is a veteran puzzle master \u2014 she enjoys making crosswords as birthday gifts for her father, York University chancellor Gregory Sorbara. A highlight of her 2020 was receiving a thoughtful rejection from the New York Times for a crossword she\u2019d submitted that had the theme of shape-shifting. \u201cI\u2019m going to submit another one, and I have high hopes!\u201d she says.\n\nTo carve out time for themselves, they take turns putting Barlow down for his nap and to bed at night. \u201cAnd our glory time is when we finally get him down to bed and we have our evening to ourselves,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nThat\u2019s when the strategy board games come out. Their current favourite is A Few Acres of Snow, an out-of-print two-player game from 2011 based on the struggle between the French and the British to occupy Canada. Sorbara learned the game from her cousin, a board-game collector. \u201cIt\u2019s hilariously nerdy,\u201d she says. Vitiello also juggles three ongoing poker groups on Zoom: a game with friends, a game with fellow chefs and a game with \u201cthe old-timers, Martina\u2019s father and his friends.\u201d\n\nBut the highlight remains watching their baby boy grow. \u201cIn the past year, I think we have seen three different versions of him and had to say goodbye to some really sweet versions only to [witness the] birth [of] the next incarnation of who this child is,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cIt\u2019s been so special to see that growth together.\u201d\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/article-dragonette-martina-sorbara/", "page_content": "When electro-pop group Dragonette landed on the music scene in 2007 with their debut disc, Galore, Canadian radio was busy taking the charts hostage with unstylish, postgrunge burnout bands (think Our Lady Peace and Finger Eleven). Fortunately, Martina Sorbara, Dragonette\u2019s frontwoman, lyricist and creative director, came along. She changed the EDM-challenged and glamour-deficient musical landscape of CanCon for the better.\n\nDragonette \u2013 which went from a trio to a solo act, owing to Sorbara\u2019s divorce with the band\u2019s former bassist \u2013 reframed Canadian music culture as a chic hub that went beyond the plaid-plagued, Sk8er Boi aesthetic of the time. Sorbara\u2019s slick video concepts (think Bj\u00f6rk meets BTS), highly danceable choruses (Cyndi Lauper once dubbed Dragonette, \u201cthe future of pop\u201d) and forward-fashion sense (which prompted a collab with designer Jean Paul Gaultier) presented the world with a fresh example of Canada\u2019s musical DNA \u2013 one that integrated dance, soul, visual art and fashion.\n\nOn the cusp of Dragonette\u2019s fifth album, Twennies, and the album release party at the Axis Club in Toronto on Nov. 16, the Italian-Canadian talent dishes on motherhood, her new-found creative control and making art in the digital age.\n\nWhat is motivating you most while fronting Dragonette alone postdivorce?\n\nI\u2019m realizing how much I have to offer and all the self-worth that comes with that. I had an eye-opening experience with a big producer \u2013 who I won\u2019t name. I was in the studio with him and he couldn\u2019t play chords to a certain song, he just wasn\u2019t getting it. I had so much patience for him fumbling around. In the old days, I wouldn\u2019t dream of showing a guy how to play something but at a certain point, I asked, \u201cCan I try?\u201d and played the chords easily. I realized that for some reason, I had to dim myself in the past because I was presuming knowledge that isn\u2019t even there \u2013 presuming he knows better than me. I realize that this experience with the producer was just PTSD. Now, I\u2019m just taking ownership and not being the host for any parasites any more.\n\nThis album possesses nostalgia for a time with no social media. Why is this theme important to you?\n\nWell, the digital onslaught happening right now does make you nostalgic, doesn\u2019t it? Remember a night out with no photos and just a flip phone? Think of the hours of your life unaccounted for because you\u2019re just looking at your phone. Not having your mind think in a digital way is kind of a relief too. The angle that we\u2019re looking at things [with] is warped \u2013 our experience is constantly shifting into that question: \u201cIs this social media? Or real life?\u201d I feel like we\u2019re constantly flipping from our brain eyes to our screen eyes.\n\nDragonette\u2019s album covers and videos look like they were born for Instagram and TikTok. Does the vast number of references you see now cultivate or confuse your vision?\n\nYou can have your mind blown away multiple times a day online but sometimes, you have to realize that your mind doesn\u2019t actually get blown away because you\u2019re just desensitized to the amount of colour and action you see on screen. Artists have this double-edged sword with social media because there\u2019s just so much of it and it\u2019s hard to put it in any kind of mental Rolodex and think, oh this is so inspiring! A certain aesthetic on Instagram and TikTok might be hard to get excited about because once it\u2019s out there you feel like it\u2019s already been done.\n\nWhich pieces of art in your own collection fuel you?\n\nA piece of work from [Toronto-based artist duo] the Broadbent Sisters. I found out about it because I worked with their brother, [artist] Justin Broadbent, for album cover art and he had a photo of their work on his computer. The image is a rainbow staircase decorated with all these flowers around it. I\u2019m also obsessed [Mallorca-based] artist Louise Despont \u2013 who uses ink and pencil on repurposed ledger paper \u2013 I have a piece that looks very tribal. I also have a portrait of a cat by [London-based] artist Christopher Page.\n\nAside from creating songs, you also make art. What mediums have you been in to lately?\n\nI\u2019m working toward having my own exhibit. I\u2019m working on drawings and sculptures. I have a series of faces with numbers on them. It\u2019s almost like hidden faces and expressions. I have line drawings \u2013 one is of a disco ball and I\u2019m doing these big pen drawings that are taking more than 12 hours to finish. I\u2019m also making ceramic necklaces and before the pandemic I made a piggy bank shaped like a vagina.\n\nYou grew up in what you called a hippie commune in British Columbia and made guitars with your hands. Are you doing DIY craft lessons with your son?\n\nI\u2019m so obsessed with making things. It\u2019s my whole reason of living. I try to do crafts with my kid but I also don\u2019t want to force him enjoy the same things that I enjoy, but I would love it if he was an obsessive maker too. I\u2019m still learning about how to be a mom. In terms of inhabiting the music-making persona of Dragonette \u2013 having a baby was also not clear to me. I didn\u2019t understand. I felt like my body cleaved into two different people.\n\nHaving [Chef] Corey Vitello as a partner must come with perks. What are the best dishes he\u2019s made you so far?\n\nWe had morels growing in our garden and I picked them and made him make me just a very simple morel pasta \u2013 that felt very special because they are so hard to find. He was developing a dish of miso, trout with asparagus and enoki mushrooms that was beautiful. He\u2019s finishing his cookbook soon so a lot of the food we eat is in that. This spring at our house he was doing food shoots downstairs and I was in the studio making music, so it was intense.\n\nYou have a slew of fashion-inspired songs like Fire In Your New Shoes, Big Sunglasses, New Suit and T-Shirt. Where do you like to shop?\n\nVSP Consignment. I like treasure hunting because it\u2019s so hard to shop for new clothes. When I see five of the same outfit on a sales rack, it\u2019s a real turn-off \u2013 that\u2019s why I buy vintage. I wasn\u2019t watching Beverly Hills, 90210, Sex and the City or reading Cosmo and getting socialized to be obsessed with the shoe and the purse or any accessories when I was growing up, so that affects the way I do things. I have such a different relationship with fashion. I have a lot of fun putting together quirky, unique outfits but I\u2019m not looking at trends."}, {"url": "https://www.celebsages.com/martina-sorbara/", "page_content": "Birth Name: Martina Sorbara Occupation: Rock Singer Born In: Ontario, Canada Birthdate: November 13, 1978 Age: 44 years old (as of 2023) Ethnicity: Unknown Nationality: Canadian Sexuality: N/A\n\nMartina Sorbara was born on the 13th of November, 1978.

During the six years since Dragonette\u2019s last recording, 2016\u2019s \u201cRoyal Blues,\u201d Sorbara experienced the final dissolution of the original creative partnership at the heart of Dragonette, the start of a new romantic relationship and the subsequent birth of her first child followed by the further life-disrupting chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic, all the while wrestling with what form her musical career would take in the future.\n\nAll this upheaval audibly informs what might just be Dragonette\u2019s finest album yet, a mature, three-dimensional pop offering that grapples with the simultaneous terror and thrilling potential of Big Change before confidently accepting that sometimes Big Change is the only way forward.\n\n\u201cDragonette was on the gurney,\u201d admitted Sorbara over a post-rehearsal pint at her local microbrewery in the Roncesvalles neighbourhood. \u201cI was just, like, \u2018I\u2019m gonna go make some music and we\u2019ll defibrillate you if we need you. I\u2019m gonna go make this record and we\u2019ll see what it is and then maybe we\u2019ll take you off life support.\u2019 And then I was, like, \u2018No, no. I have to.\u2019 Because now Dragonette feels like mine.\u201d\n\nIt seems odd that Sorbara, 43, would be nervous about carrying Dragonette \u2014 which she formed with her ex-husband, Dan Kurtz, 15 years ago \u2014 ahead as a solo act since she began performing and recording as a solo act when she was just 16.\n\nBut once she and Kurtz decided, after making \u201cRoyal Blues\u201d together six years ago despite their recent separation, to part ways creatively, as well, it took her some time to claim the name and the legacy of Dragonette as her own. And also to realize that she was now in a position to do whatever she wanted with it.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to wrap up shop. I was doing well just floating around the world writing with other people, doing collaborations,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d started writing for other artists, and I love collaborating and I love writing and I love releasing music. It was just the idea of having to put something that\u2019s just mine behind my name and being the only person in the picture.\u201d\n\nA series of encounters with potential label suitors didn\u2019t help her disenchantment, as A&R professionals offered Sorbara \u2014 whose done just fine penning top-shelf pop fodder in the past with the likes of Martin Solveig and Kaskade, as well as for other artists such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Keith Urban \u2014 guidance towards the future in the form of radio-ready playlists that really didn\u2019t sit comfortably with her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to diss what\u2019s on the radio but it just was, like, \u2018If I\u2019m supposed to try to get on the radio, I don\u2019t want to make music anymore,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt\u2019s not like \u2018Music used to be better and now it sucks.\u2019 I just don\u2019t want to make that. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s bad. It\u2019s just not for me. Maybe I aged out of it. I don\u2019t know.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even like it was bad music. It was just, like, \u2018No, I can\u2019t do that.\u2019 My soul just reacted in a way where I thought \u2018If that\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do, maybe I\u2019m not a band anymore because I don\u2019t want to do that.\u2019\u201d\n\nA fortunate encounter with producer Dan Farber, who\u2019s worked with Lizzo and Dizzee Rascal in the past, during a \u201crandom\u201d writing trip to Los Angeles proved to be the catalyst for \u201cTwennies\u201d \u2014 even if it took Sorbara some time to wake up to that fact.\n\nOne of the first tunes the two wrote together was the sweet, bossa nova-tinged ballad \u201cThis Is All You Get,\u201d yet at the time of its creation Sorbara deemed it a bad fit for Dragonette. Yet as time moved on, it dawned on her that now that Dragonette was just her, Dragonette could sound like whatever the hell she wanted Dragonette to sound like. She could even re-embrace her \u201cinner Ani DiFranco\u201d and take the music in directions that hearken back to her formative years as a folk singer/songwriter. Farber was a willing co-conspirator.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so amazing. I\u2019ve worked with so many people over the last 10 years when I started just walking in with strangers or whatever,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never made a musical connection where all of a sudden you\u2019re speaking a creative language with such easy flow and there\u2019s no weird judginess and I\u2019m not going to censor anything and that was how it was from the very beginning. We wrote that song and I was, like, \u2018Too bad it\u2019s not Dragonette.\u2019 But with time and space and feeling like I could do whatever I want, it went from being \u2018I can do whatever I want. This has to be a Dragonette record and this is how I make this thing mine.\u2019 It was a thing I had to do to own the past 15 years of my life.\u201d\n\nWith \u201cTwennies\u201d thrown out to the world at large on Oct. 28, Dragonette returns to a Toronto stage on Thursday at the Axis Club. It\u2019s one of only a handful of gigs she\u2019s done since the last record, but the first \u2014 a trip to the Planet Pride celebrations in Brooklyn last summer which she almost cancelled at the last minute \u2014 gave her inner confirmation that she was capable of claiming Dragonette as her own.\n\nAfter performing the worldwide smash \u201cHello,\u201d a 2010 collaboration with DJ/producer Solveig that was back on the Billboard charts this year thanks to its inclusion in the TV series \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d before the Planet Pride crowd Sorbara wandered around and heard \u201cHello,\u201d her Kaskade cut \u201cFire In Your New Shoes\u201d and her Galantis co-write \u201cPeanut Butter Jelly\u201d being spun to delirious crowds by other DJs. It was a welcome boost of confidence.\n\n\u201cI wrote all these songs but I\u2019d never in my life allowed myself to feel that,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was like something happening outside of me and I couldn\u2019t take ownership of it and, for some reason, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because now Dragonette is me and it\u2019s mine I feel myself more holistically in this thing and I\u2019m like \u2018Wow, I did all those things.\u2019 And those songs are living on. \u2018Hello\u2019 was on the top of the f---ing Billboard charts this year. That\u2019s a f---ing classic.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy point is not tooting my own horn or saying \u2018Look at all this sh--- I did,\u2019 but for the past 10 years I never took ownership of it. I just flew down there by myself. I had no entourage. I was a floater. And then I got up onstage and I sang for the first performance and something about the aloneness of me there, I think, made me realize all of a sudden \u2018Oh, I had to do this.\u2019 I woke up to my autonomy and my ownership of all this stuff and then I kept hearing my songs and all of a sudden I owned them and I was me.\u201d\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://www.laweekly.com/enter-the-dragonette/", "page_content": "Enter the Dragonette: Dragonette returned last fall with her first album in six years, Twennies.

Sorbara has previously worked with artists such as Martin Solveig on the hit \u201cHello.\u201d Listen in for a catchy, light-hearted experience.\n\nThe first song, \u201cSeasick,\u201d introduces the album with a very colorful-sounding song about unrequited love.

The lyrics of the chorus, \u201cI wear your t-shirt a lot\u201d show the longing of the singer for their former romantic interest, as do the wistful chords and guitar parts. This song, though simple in style, is musically deep and lyrically thoughtful.\n\nA little later in the album is \u201cGood Intentions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m coming in hot with my good intentions, but I never live up to my expectations,\u201d are the lyrics of the chorus.

It's a style that initially drew comparisons to the Scissor Sisters, No Doubt, and the Killers, especially with the release of 2007's Galore and 2009's Fixin' to Thrill. However, later albums like 2012's Bodyparts and the group's international hit collaboration with producer Martin Solveig, \"Hello,\" proved the group had its own confident, club-savvy identity. While 2015's Royal Blues marked the end of Sorbara and longtime-collaborator Dan Kurtz's relationship, she forged ahead and debuted her solo version of Dragonette on 2022's Twennies.\n\nMartina Sorbara founded Dragonette in 2005 with multi-instrumentalist Dan Kurtz (formerly of the jazz and electronica-influenced Toronto-based jam band the New Deal), guitarist Simon Craig, and drummer Joel Stouffer. The daughter of York University Chancellor and former member of Ontario's provincial government Greg Sorbara, Sorbara had previously maintained a moderately successful solo career as an AOR/adult alternative artist in the style of Sarah McLachlan, releasing several albums including 2002's The Cure for Bad Deeds. However, after sparking a creative and romantic partnership with Kurtz, she decided to move forward in a collaborative fashion with Dragonette.\n\nA self-released and self-titled 2005 demo attracted the attention of the U.K. office of Mercury Records, which offered Dragonette a recording contract the following year. Moving their base of operations from Toronto to London (and losing Craig in the process, replaced by British guitarist Will Stapleton), Dragonette released their first single, \"I Get Around,\" in April 2007. Three more singles followed, \"Take It Like a Man,\" \"Competition,\" and a gender-reversal cover of Calvin Harris' hit \"The Girls\" called \"The Boys.\" Dragonette's debut album, Galore, was released in late summer 2007. The same year, Sorbara sang lead vocals on the hit Basement Jaxx single \"Take Me Back to Your House.\" Galore was released in the U.S. in 2008 on I Surrender Records.\n\nThe band's second album, Fixin' to Thrill, a more focused and polished effort that charted in Canada's Top Ten, arrived in 2009 and earned a nomination for Dance Recording of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards. The following year, Dragonette released the Mixin' to Thrill remix album and collaborated with several dance producers on singles such as Kaskade's \"Fire in Your New Shoes,\" Don Diablo's \"Animale,\" and, most notably, Martin Solveig's \"Hello.\" The single, which appeared on Solveig's 2011 album Smash, became a worldwide hit, topping the charts in five countries, reaching the Top Ten in ten other countries, and topping Billboard's Hot Dance Club chart in the U.S. early in 2011 (the song ultimately earned the group a Juno for Dance Recording of the Year in 2012).\n\nIn 2011, Dragonette co-wrote and produced the song \"Lucky Day\" for Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts' solo album Cinderella's Eyes, and returned to the studio to work on their third album. Released in 2012, Bodyparts was the first Dragonette album to be produced by the band, as well as the first to be released in Canada and the U.S. at the same time. The band followed it with several years of singles and collaborations, including a 2013 cover of the Mister Rogers' Neighborhood theme song \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" that appeared in Target Canada commercials. Later, team-ups with Mike Mago, LENNO, Joey Stylez, Paul Harris, and Big Data kept them busy in 2014 and 2015.\n\nDragonette issued the single \"Let the Night Fall\" in June 2015, offering the first taste of their fourth album, Royal Blues, which was inspired in part by Sorbara and Kurtz's separation. It was released in November 2016 and featured production work by Mago and U.K. producer Dada. Following the end of their relationship, Kurtz returned to his former band the New Deal, while Sorbara moved forward with Dragonette as her solo project. In October 2022, she returned with the full-length Twennies, recorded in Toronto with producer Dan Farber (Dizzee Rascal, Lizzo)."}, {"url": "https://www.thestar.com/life/together/people/2021/01/17/at-home-with-chef-cory-vitiello-dragonette-singer-martina-sorbara-and-their-adorable-toddler-barlow.html", "page_content": "What\u2019s life in lockdown with a two-year-old like? \u201cThe greatest!\u201d says Martina Sorbara. \u201cWe\u2019re really fortunate,\u201d says her partner, chef Cory Vitiello, of life at home with Barlow, who turned two in September. \u201cWe just have so much time during this critical stage to spend with him and watch him grow and enjoy every step.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s busy schedules usually mean that they\u2019re anywhere but at their home, which is between High Park and Roncesvalles Village. All that changed with the lockdown in March 2020, when Dragonette, Sorbara\u2019s indie-pop project, was put on hold, and Vitiello, founder of elevated-takeout-rotisserie-chicken joint Flock Rotisserie + Greens, faced a wave of heartbreaking April cancellations, including Biblio Bash, the Toronto Public Library fundraiser with his catering partner 10Tation, and his annual fundraising dinner for children\u2019s cancer charity Camp Ooch at Cactus Club Caf\u00e9, where he is head of culinary development for Toronto.\n\nBut the silver lining has been the extra time at home with their son. Right now, Barlow is learning to talk (\u201cHe calls me \u2018hon\u2019 and \u2018babe,\u2019\u201d Sorbara says with a laugh), and he graduated early from potty training, which the couple initiated once they realized that their normally packed schedules had dramatically freed up.\n\nIt\u2019s created plenty of time for lazy Sundays. \u201cWe\u2019ve made Sundays about us,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so special. We lock ourselves in, do our crosswords and cook.\u201d On a typical weekend, the family will get up early and go for a stroll through High Park or Roncesvalles Village. They\u2019re regulars at the Roncy caf\u00e9 Reunion Island, sometimes scooping up a legendary breakfast sandwich from the Gold Standard takeout window. \u201cThey treat Barlow like a VIP,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nVitiello, a chef since he was 15, spent most Sundays during the first two decades of his 25-year career working hectic shifts in kitchens. After closing his acclaimed Harbord Room restaurant in 2016, his life changed. Now, in contrast to the harried pace of a restaurant kitchen, Vitiello savours the slower speed of cooking at home. He starts the day by picking up fresh ingredients from local merchants, such as fish market Hooked or Roncesvalles produce stand Ko Fruit Market.\n\nThough veggies and fish are usually the core ingredients of his mains, a high-quality cut of meat constitutes a special Sunday treat. Braised meats, especially short ribs, have been a favourite comfort food over the winter. While Sorbara is a pescatarian, Vitiello says he has \u201cno problem spending the whole Sunday cooking this braise that could feed 15 people, even though there is only one person in the house who eats it.\u201d Thankfully, it\u2019s not hard to find some outside assistance. \u201cI usually take some to the neighbours [as a] surprise,\u201d he says.\n\nSorbara is a whiz in the kitchen, too, whipping up pastries to satisfy Vitiello\u2019s sweet tooth. She\u2019s happiest, however, spending a cosy Sunday working away on a crossword, a pastime Vitiello has picked up as well, along with his Sudoku habit.\n\nSorbara is a veteran puzzle master \u2014 she enjoys making crosswords as birthday gifts for her father, York University chancellor Gregory Sorbara. A highlight of her 2020 was receiving a thoughtful rejection from the New York Times for a crossword she\u2019d submitted that had the theme of shape-shifting. \u201cI\u2019m going to submit another one, and I have high hopes!\u201d she says.\n\nTo carve out time for themselves, they take turns putting Barlow down for his nap and to bed at night. \u201cAnd our glory time is when we finally get him down to bed and we have our evening to ourselves,\u201d says Vitiello.\n\nThat\u2019s when the strategy board games come out. Their current favourite is A Few Acres of Snow, an out-of-print two-player game from 2011 based on the struggle between the French and the British to occupy Canada. Sorbara learned the game from her cousin, a board-game collector. \u201cIt\u2019s hilariously nerdy,\u201d she says. Vitiello also juggles three ongoing poker groups on Zoom: a game with friends, a game with fellow chefs and a game with \u201cthe old-timers, Martina\u2019s father and his friends.\u201d\n\nBut the highlight remains watching their baby boy grow. \u201cIn the past year, I think we have seen three different versions of him and had to say goodbye to some really sweet versions only to [witness the] birth [of] the next incarnation of who this child is,\u201d says Vitiello. \u201cIt\u2019s been so special to see that growth together.\u201d\n\nRead more about:\n\nSHARE:"}, {"url": "https://canadatoday.news/ca/toronto-singer-martina-sorbara-and-the-return-of-dragonette-148681/", "page_content": "Martina Sorbara jokes that every interview she\u2019s had in support of Dragonette\u2019s long-matured new album Twennies turns out to be \u201ca bit of therapy.\u201d\n\nIt makes perfect sense as making the record was something of a therapeutic process for the Toronto electropop singer.

It's a style that initially drew comparisons to the Scissor Sisters, No Doubt, and the Killers, especially with the release of 2007's Galore and 2009's Fixin' to Thrill. However, later albums like 2012's Bodyparts and the group's international hit collaboration with producer Martin Solveig, \"Hello,\" proved the group had its own confident, club-savvy identity. While 2015's Royal Blues marked the end of Sorbara and longtime-collaborator Dan Kurtz's relationship, she forged ahead and debuted her solo version of Dragonette on 2022's Twennies.\n\nMartina Sorbara founded Dragonette in 2005 with multi-instrumentalist Dan Kurtz (formerly of the jazz and electronica-influenced Toronto-based jam band the New Deal), guitarist Simon Craig, and drummer Joel Stouffer. The daughter of York University Chancellor and former member of Ontario's provincial government Greg Sorbara, Sorbara had previously maintained a moderately successful solo career as an AOR/adult alternative artist in the style of Sarah McLachlan, releasing several albums including 2002's The Cure for Bad Deeds. However, after sparking a creative and romantic partnership with Kurtz, she decided to move forward in a collaborative fashion with Dragonette.\n\nA self-released and self-titled 2005 demo attracted the attention of the U.K. office of Mercury Records, which offered Dragonette a recording contract the following year. Moving their base of operations from Toronto to London (and losing Craig in the process, replaced by British guitarist Will Stapleton), Dragonette released their first single, \"I Get Around,\" in April 2007. Three more singles followed, \"Take It Like a Man,\" \"Competition,\" and a gender-reversal cover of Calvin Harris' hit \"The Girls\" called \"The Boys.\" Dragonette's debut album, Galore, was released in late summer 2007. The same year, Sorbara sang lead vocals on the hit Basement Jaxx single \"Take Me Back to Your House.\" Galore was released in the U.S. in 2008 on I Surrender Records.\n\nThe band's second album, Fixin' to Thrill, a more focused and polished effort that charted in Canada's Top Ten, arrived in 2009 and earned a nomination for Dance Recording of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards. The following year, Dragonette released the Mixin' to Thrill remix album and collaborated with several dance producers on singles such as Kaskade's \"Fire in Your New Shoes,\" Don Diablo's \"Animale,\" and, most notably, Martin Solveig's \"Hello.\" The single, which appeared on Solveig's 2011 album Smash, became a worldwide hit, topping the charts in five countries, reaching the Top Ten in ten other countries, and topping Billboard's Hot Dance Club chart in the U.S. early in 2011 (the song ultimately earned the group a Juno for Dance Recording of the Year in 2012).\n\nIn 2011, Dragonette co-wrote and produced the song \"Lucky Day\" for Girls Aloud member Nicola Roberts' solo album Cinderella's Eyes, and returned to the studio to work on their third album. Released in 2012, Bodyparts was the first Dragonette album to be produced by the band, as well as the first to be released in Canada and the U.S. at the same time. The band followed it with several years of singles and collaborations, including a 2013 cover of the Mister Rogers' Neighborhood theme song \"Won't You Be My Neighbor?\" that appeared in Target Canada commercials.

It\u2019s a damn classic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for me to honk my own horn or say, \u2018Look at this shit I\u2019ve done,\u2019 but in the last 10 years I\u2019ve never owned it. I just flew down there alone. I had no entourage. I was a floater. And then I got on stage and I sang for the premiere and something about my loneliness there I think suddenly made me realize, \u2018Oh, me would have in order to do this.\u2019 I woke up to my autonomy and ownership of all these things and then I kept listening to my songs and suddenly I owned them and I was me.\u201d\n\nBen Rayner is a Toronto-based journalist and a regular contributor to the Star\u2019s Culture section.
