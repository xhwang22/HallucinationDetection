He had a very close relationship with Rickey Paulding and spoke about his memories of him.\n\nThanks Josh for talking to germanhoops.com Where are you at the moment and how is basketball life treating you?\n\nHey Miles. I am doing well I am in Dallas Texas right now. I spent the first part of the season with Paok in Greece. Unfortunately I suffered an injury that ended my season but I am back healthy and hoping to play again next year.\n\nYou played as a rookie in Oldenburg as Rickey Paulding was already in his seventh season and third in Oldenburg. Has Paulding\u2019s amazing longevity in some way rubbed off on you to keep grinding and keep playing?\n\nIt has been impressive to see what Rickey has been able to do with his career. I definitely have looked to him many times in my career and have strived to have longevity in my career just like he has.\n\nYou have played in so many countries and with so many teams. Did you ever think about staying with one team as you got older? Granted as an American it is tough as money is always a temptation, but Rickey somehow was able to remain 15 years with the EWE Baskets Oldenburg.\n\n\n\nI think every player would love to stick to a good situation that they enjoy. As you said money and being comfortable becomes the main issue. I don\u2019t know Rickey\u2019s situation in Oldenburg over the years, but I would assume Oldenburg offered solid money and comfortability for him and his family and that\u2019s why he always chose to come back. He rewarded them with his loyalty for them rewarding him with something that was fair and reasonable on the financial side of things even if it was a little less than he could make somewhere else.\n\nRickey Paulding is playing his farewell game on June 4. What is the first thing that you think of when you hear the name Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nThere have been some gems that have played for a long time and pretty well as they reach an older age. Of course it doesn\u2019t happen often and is very difficult to do. Thats what makes it so special that Rickey became one of the few players to accomplish this and he deserves all the respect and praise he is receiving. It\u2019s not easy to have success year in and year out as you get older.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you met him? Was his smile and personality instantly infectious?\n\nFirst impression was he was just a true professional and a great person. Always kind and always respectful to everyone. I was his back up and his neighbor my first year so I spent a lot of time guarding him and with him off the court. Him and his family really took care of me and taught me many things about overseas basketball and just life in general that year. I always say I don\u2019t know where I would have been if it wasn\u2019t for the Paulding\u2019s my first year.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you saw him on the court? What was the first thing that really stuck out?\n\nOn the court my first impression was probably his smoothness. He could shoot and he was explosive but he was very calm and poised with it all. Never out of control. Always played at his pace and played his game.\n\nYou played one season with him. Is there anything specific that you feel you were able to take from his presence on the court?\n\n\n\nI just learned to take what the defense gives you but also be aggressive. He was also very smart with the way he trained. Smarter not harder. Our coach that year used to love making us do long distance running around a lake and I was a rookie and was trying to be first and go hard and I remember him and another teammate telling me it doesn\u2019t matter how fast or good you do at running these miles, if you ain\u2019t putting that ball in the basket in practice or games you will get cut haha so save your energy for things on the court that actually matter.\n\nWas there a game that stuck out most?\n\n\n\nRickey had many games during my time there that stood out. It\u2019s hard to pen point just one. He was always showing up when it mattered.\n\nWhat is your fondest moment with him on and off the court that you will never forget?\n\n\n\nMy fondest moment on the court is hard to pin point it\u2019s been a very long time since I played with Rickey so it\u2019s hard to remember exact things. Off the court though it was all the times spent having dinner with him and his family at their home and at restaurants. We spent a lot of time together off the court and those are the memories that stick more so than the basketball memories.\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you believe will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL? Do feel that there will ever be another American that will be able to reach his longevity in that league?\n\n\n\nI think his legacy will last forever. I don\u2019t think there will ever be another Rickey Paulding that did it at the level he did it with one team for that long of a duration.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey Paulding.\n\n\n\nCongrats on an awesome career Rickey. Many people are celebrating your success and are very happy for you and proud of you. Enjoy retirement!\n\nTags : JOSH CARTER, PAOK THESSALONIKI, GERMAN BASKETBALL"}, {"url": "https://www.proballers.com/basketball/player/14025/rickey-paulding", "page_content": "Rickey Paulding - Points Rickey Paulding scores a career high 39 points (2007) On May 02, 2007, Rickey Paulding set his career high in points in a France - Betclic Elite game.

Where are you at the moment and how is basketball life treating you?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m in St Louis, Missouri. Everything is good. I\u2019m a high school basketball coach at Kirkwood high school.\n\nYou retired in 2016. I always hoped that you would of played longer. Could your body still have let you played a few more years?\n\nBody wise yes but not mind wise. I just felt that at that time I couldn\u2019t do it on the court the way I was accustomed to. I knew my time had passed by and I didn\u2019t want to cheat the game and let it be a money thing. You should be playing the game for the love of it. When I lost it, I knew it was time to go.\n\nAre you still connected to basketball in other ways besides being ahigh school coach?\n\n\n\nYes I am with my sons. I have an 18 year old who is more connected to football while my 13 year old is more connected to basketball.\n\nRickey Paulding is playing his farewell game on June 4. What is the first thing that you think of when you hear the name Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nA legend. He is a good friend of mine and I respect him a lot.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you met him? Was his smile and personality instantly infectious already there at Missouri in the two years where you were teammates?\n\nThe first time I met him was on the campus of Missouri when I came in as a freshman. I remember that I was very small when I came to Missouri. I was something like 180 pounds. I talked to him about the college life. I wasn\u2019t afraid, but I was weary of not being strong enough. He was very understanding and told me you will get stronger and that everything will be all right. I will never forget that.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you saw him on the court? What was the first thing that really stuck out?\n\nHow he competed and what it took to win. He was the best offensive player, but also the best defensive player on the team. He always guarded the other teams best player. That really opened my eyes. He was an incredible athlete and was always number one in the sprints. But even more he was a great person that took me under his wing.\n\nYou played two seasons with him at the University of Missouri from 2002-2004. What was your fondest moment on the court with him?\n\nIt was my freshman year when we played Marquette and Dwayne Wade. He had something like 36 points. He only had something like one mistake in the game. I remember the game was on the line and I was open, but opted to take the last shot and missed. The game went into overtime. This is one of those games that I will never forget. It was on national tv and he hit 36 on Dwade.\n\nMiles Schmidt-Scheuber with Rickey Paulding and Jimmy Mckinney in Oldenburg in 2007\n\nIf someone had told you in 2004 that he would have a professional career until 2022 what would you have thought? Was his work ethic already very good in school?\n\nI would of definitely believed it. Especially with the way he took care of his body and how his conditioning was. He had a God\u2019s gift and he wanted Rickey to be the kind of player that he would be.\n\nDo you think your record against him in the BBL was above or below 500?\n\n\n\nIt is below 500.\n\nThat is correct.Your record against Jimmy was 6-11 not including cup games. What was it like playing against your ex teammate and friend?\n\nIt was always tough playing against him. He was the focal point and they always had a good team around him. It was bitter sweet. On one hand I was playing against a friend, but at the same time, I wanted to win. But I was always happy to see him do great things. But I always wanted to beat him.\n\nWas there a specific game that you will never forget?\n\n\n\nThe first time we played against each other in Frankfurt.\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you believe will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL? Do feel that there will ever be another American that will be able to reach his longevity in that league?\n\nI don\u2019t think it will ever happen again. It is like if someone would beat Steph Curry\u2019s 3 point shooting records. I think that if someone could do it then Quantez Robertson. I don\u2019t know if he can. He is close though. He needs 2-3 more years.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey Paulding.\n\n\n\nI want to thank him for being a friend and being a positive role model. I want to thank him for taking a kid from St Louis and taking him under his wing and showing me the ropes. I also want to thank him for not cheating the game and playing it the right way at a high level. I also want applaud him and his family for opening their arms and accepting me. If they ever need anything, I will lay down the red carpet. I\u2019m really proud of you and your a great role model and father.

What is the first thing that you think of when you hear the name Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nLegend especially in Oldenburg. They call it Pauldingburg. It is just amazing everything that he accomplished there. He is an amazing person, husband, father and great friend.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you met him? Was his smile and personality instantly infectious?\n\nWe were with the same agent so I knew who he was. I always knew that it would be a battle when I would go against him. He was a beast and I always knew that I couldn\u2019t take it easy against him. I\u2019m really glad that we could play together for 3 years. I always knew it would be a battle. We have great respect for each other.\n\nYou played three seasons with him. At that time you and him belonged to the top 5 players in a league. What did you always appreciate most about his game?\n\n\n\nI always appreciated his professionalism, the way he approached the game and his knowledge. He always treated everyone with respect and was a calm spirit.\n\nIn your three seasons he had so many great games. Was the cup weekend in Oldenburg in 2015 your most memorable time with him?\n\nThe cup weekend was one of the most memorable times with him. I can\u2019t recall all the great games. We played so much tag team. We would take turns having great games. It was really amazing what he could do on the court. He called me microwave. He would say let\u2019s go microwave. It was fun times.\n\n\n\nWhat is your fondest moment with him on and off the court that you will never forget?\n\n\n\nThe family and holiday time.

There will never be another Rickey Paulding.\n\nWho won a one on one then in practice?\n\nWe never played 1-1 after practice. But in practice we went against each other. He got some and I got some. I don\u2019t know who won more though. We always battled each other and pushed each other to get better.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey Paulding.\n\nIt was a real pleasure seeing your career and the impact that you had in Oldenburg and the Euro sports world.

He spoke to germanhoops.com about his memories of Rickey Paulding.\n\nThanks Chris for talking to germanhoops.com. Where are you at the moment and how is basketball life treating you at the moment.\n\nHey Miles appreciate doing another interview with you. At the moment I am at home in Velburg, Bavaria. Since the season doesn\u2019t start until Oktober I\u2019ve taken a little longer time off than usual.\n\nYou played the last few years for the Wiha Panthers. How do you summarize the last season? There were a lot of ups and downs. How vital was the team chemistry that seemed to never gel for the results of the season.\n\nThe season was very difficult. Umm it really was a season of ups and downs. We would beat some of the best teams and lose to the teams that we should have beat. The team chemistry off the court was perfect. We all got along with each other, but we sadly couldn\u2019t translate that to the court, but at the end of the day we helped the Panthers stay in the Pro A and that\u2019s what counted at the end.\n\nIn the last week came bad news that the club might lose the license for the ProA. How devastating would it be for the organization to get set back like this.\n\nIt would really suck because I had promised Coach Alen that we would give everything we had to keep this club in that Pro A. The pPnthers gives guys like me another chance to showcase what we can do and they do a good job at picking players back up after they got knocked down. I\u2019d hate to see Schwenningen not get the license.\n\nWhen you hear the name Rickey Paulding what is the thing that comes to mind.\n\n\n\nLegend, leader, loyalty. You don\u2019t usually see those words to often in this game. To me he seemed to be the ultimate leader!\n\nThis season the easyCredit BBL lost some legends with Paulding, Guenther and King. Soon Quentez Robertson also will belong to this group someday. Does the BBL have to worry about finding new identity figures.\n\n\n\nI believe so, but that\u2019s not the leagues fault. We are in an era where we as players look for clubs that have the most money. We can\u2019t play this game forever so we have to make the most of what we can get. That being said we also don\u2019t have committed guys lol like that anymore. I\u2019m pretty sure every single one of those guys could have left their teams and made more money, but they stuck with their teams and are all legends and their names will always be remembered.\n\nYou only played twice against him in the BBL. How did you observe him as a player before 2015 and after as a second Bundesliga player.\n\nWell oddly enough I knew nothing about him. I used to only pay attention to the NBA, but after I saw his picture in front of the arena I knew he was big time. It\u2019s always crazy to see how humble he was and how everyone in that arena loved him. After I saw that I knew he was a big deal in this league.\n\nRickey Paulding played until nearly 40. He probably could of played 2-3 more years. How much of a role model is he for any player in terms of work ethic?\n\nEnter\n\n\n\nYou don\u2019t get to play that long without taking care of your body. I\u2019m sure 99% of players in the world would love to play for that long and still perform at the highest level.\n\nYou played against Rickey Paulding twice in the 2015-2016 season with Crailsheim. What do you remember most with your 2 battles against him besides the blowouts.\n\n\n\nOuch Miles haha that hurt a little. I\u2019ll remember how calm and collective he played.\n\nMany players said his athleticism really stood out, but what did you appreciate most about his game?\n\n\n\nHow calm he played and how well he always led his teams.\n\nHow will Ricky Paulding\u2019s legacy be forever be remembered in the BBL? Will we ever see a guy like him again that will show his consistency on the court and dedication to one organization?\n\n\n\nHe will be remembered as top 5 of all time probably. Will we see a player like that again? With the same dedication? no I don\u2019t believe so.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey Paulding.\n\n\n\nRickey, thank you for everything you\u2019ve done for the game. I\u2019ve followed you ever since we played against you and you definitely played a role in how I like to treat my coaches and my Teammates. The BBL will definitely miss you and it will most definitely be weird not seeing the #23 come out the tunnel. Enjoy retirement man.

There should be very strict laws about how you can obtain guns.\n\nYou just finished your 13 season with the Fraport Skyliners. Seasons continue to get harder as you grow older? How vital will this years off season training be?\n\n\n\nMy off season training this summer will be vital. I will make sure that I come back in very good shape. Really important will be taking very good shape of my body and staying healthy.\n\nRickey Paulding is playing his farewell game on June 4. What is the first thing that you think of when you hear the name Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nHe is a hell of a player.\n\nHave you ever seen a player who has been able to play so well at a high level at his age?\n\n\n\nThe only guys that I have seen play that well at his age were the trio of Derrick Allen, Julius Jenkins and Immanuel Mcelroy. I would also put Chris Ensminger in that list.\n\nWhat do you think your record is against him in regular season action? Would you say it is above or below 500?\n\n\n\nIt is below 500.\n\nYour correct it was 10-13 in the regular season.\n\n\n\nThat isn\u2019t good, but not bad.\n\nYou played your third professional game against Rickey Paulding losing 63-61 and posting 7/3/2/3 stats. What do you remember from your first meeting against him? What was your first impression when you saw him on the court? What was the first thing that really stuck out?\n\n\n\nI remember getting a steal in Oldenburg and he facing me down and getting the block.\n\nHe was in his sixth season when you met him as a rookie. If someone then told you he would play until 40 what would you have thought?\n\n\n\nHe was already in great shape then. I would of believed longer.\n\nWhat about his game will always stay in your mind when you hear the name Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nHis turnaround shot and pull up three.\n\nPlease tell a special story that you had with him on the court? There was that story about copying a move and then doing it.\n\nWe were watching film of Oldenburg and there was a move I liked form him. I took note of it It was his turn around shot. In the game I took one of his moves and told him, I took that from you. He then just laughed and the next time down, he did that move on me and said I got you back.\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you believe will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL? Do feel that there will ever be another American that will be able to reach his longevity in that league? Maybe you?\n\n\n\nBesides me and him, I don\u2019t think there will ever be another American that will play that long in the league or for one team. The temptation for money is too big and guys will go somewhere.\n\nWho would have won a 1-1 contest in 2009 and in 2022?\n\n\n\n(Tez takes a long time thinking). It would be 1-1, but I don\u2019t know who would win when.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey Paulding.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s been a honor playing against you. It was also fun talking to you before and after games. I enjoyed having you as a friend in basketball. I wish you nothing but success in everything you do in your next career."}, {"url": "https://www.livesport.com/en/player/paulding-rickey/vZMnLKKL/", "page_content": "Last Matches\n\nCareer League Domestic Cups International Cups Season Team Competition MP MIN PTS REB AST ST 2021/2022 Oldenburg OLD BBL 34 26.4 11.9 2.6 1.6 1.1 Regular Season 34 26.4 11.9 2.6 1.6 1.1 2020/2021 Oldenburg OLD BBL 38 26.1 15.6 2.4 1.3 0.8 Play Offs 4 29 15.8 2.5 2 0.8 Regular Season 34 25.8 15.5 2.4 1.2 0.9 Season Team Competition MP MIN PTS REB AST ST 2021/2022 Oldenburg OLD German Cup 1 32 10 3 1 0 Regular Season 1 32 10 3 1 0 Season Team Competition MP MIN PTS REB AST ST 2021/2022 Oldenburg OLD Champions League 6 27 5.8 2 0.8 1 Regular Season 6 27 5.8 2 0.8 1 2019/2020 Oldenburg OLD Eurocup 16 27.7 11.6 2.6 1.1 0.9 Top 16 6 27.2 13 2 0.7 0.5 Regular Season 10 28 10.7 2.9 1.4 1.2 2017/2018 Oldenburg OLD Champions League 16 30.9 18.1 3.6 1.8 1.1 Play Offs 2 30 14.5 2 0.5 0 Regular Season 14 31 18.6 3.8 1.9 1.3\n\nNOTE: Older historical data may be incomplete, but we are in the process of updating our database."}, {"url": "https://germanhoops.com/2022/06/08/closing-words-for-rickey-paulding-from-braydon-hobbs-rickey-always-showed-great-leadership-even-in-the-toughest-times/", "page_content": "Braydon Hobbs (196-PG-1989, college: Bellarmine) is a 33 year old 196cm guard that just finished his 10th professional season and first with Monbus Obradoiro CAB Santiago de Compostela (Spain ACB) averaging 7.2ppg, 3.1rpg, 4.4apg, 1.0spg, FGP: 57.1%, 3PT: 39.6%. He played most of his career in Germany for teams like Nurnberg, Giessen, Ulm, FC Bayern Munich and was 2 years teammates with Rickey Paulding with the EWE Baskets. He also played in Australia and Hungry. He began his basketball career at 8: New Albany, IN / New Albany High School and then played 4 years at Bellarmine (NCAA2). He spoke to germanhoops.com about his memories of Rickey Paulding.\n\nThanks Braydon for talking to germanhoops.com. Where are you at the moment and how is basketball life treating you?\n\n\n\nI am back home in the states. Basketball has been well for me lately. I just finished up my 10th season in Spain.\n\nYour played this season with Monbus Obradoiro CAB Santiago de Compostela. What kind of an experience has it been playing Europe\u2019s top league ACB? What is the biggest challenge for you as a point guard to be successful on the court?\n\nThe ACB is the best league in Europe. It was a great experience for me competing at that level. Any team could beat another team on any given night. The biggest challenge was just adapting to the physical level the ACB demands. There are no plays or games you can take off.\n\nYou have had a real easyCredit BBL reunion with the Scrubb brothers and Kassius Robertson. What has it like being teammates with Philipp Scrubb? Can you beat him in shooting drills?\n\nIt was cool playing with some guys that came from Germany like I did. Philipp was a great teammate and he helped us a lot when he came from Russia. We didn\u2019t do any shooting drills but he can definitely fill it up.\n\nWhat kind of a feeling was it holding your own against real Madrid with 17 points in a tough 89-88 loss? Did a performance give a veteran like you added confidence?\n\nIt was nice to play good against Real Madrid but a win would have been a lot better. Like I said before, any team can beat any other team in the ACB, so every night teams have to be ready to compete or they will lose.\n\nRickey Paulding is playing his farewell game on June 4. What is the first thing that you think of when you hear the name Rickey Paulding?\n\n\n\nThe first thing I think about when I hear Rickey Paulding is Pauldingburg.\n\nHave you ever seen a player who has been able to play so well at a high level at his age?\n\nI have definitely not seen anyone with his physical ability at his age. He was still dunking and practicing every day when I was in Oldenburg. It was incredible.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you met him? Was his smile and personality instantly infectious?\n\n\n\nMy first impression of Rickey was how humble he was. Just a laid back guy who was extremely humbled about life and basketball.\n\nWhat was your first impression when you saw him on the court? What was the first thing that really stuck out?\n\n\n\nThe first time I saw him on the court, his Oldenburg team, beat us pretty well and I felt like he didn\u2019t miss a shot. He was fun to play against but even better to watch.\n\nYou played two seasons with him. Is there anything specific that you feel you were able to take from his presence on the court?\n\nPlaying with him two seasons was an honor for sure. I will take away from him his leadership and how humble he stayed at all times. He always showed great leadership in the toughest times.\n\nIn your two seasons he had so many great games. For instance exploding for 36 points in a loss against Crailsheim or hitting Bamberg and Munich for 36 points or 28 points against Alba Berlin. What game will you most remember from him?\n\n\n\nThere are so many great games that I experienced with him so it\u2019s hard to pick just one. The game against Crailsheim was crazy because I just remember giving him the ball and he would go get a bucket. It looked so effortless, yet nobody could stop him. It was fun to experience.\n\nWhat is your fondest moment with him on and off the court that you will never forget?\n\n\n\nGoing to the cup championship, in Berlin, was probably my fondest moment. We lost the game but I just remember talking with Rickey on the court afterwards. He just gave me the Rickey smile and shrugged his shoulders. We were proud in that moment, even though we lost.\n\nWhat kind of legacy do you believe will he leave in the EasyCredit BBL? Do feel that there will ever be another American that will be able to reach his longevity in that league?\n\nIn this day and age, I do not see another American with that kind of longevity on any team. I could be wrong, and I hope I am but it would be tough. It takes a special someone like Rickey for that to happen.\n\nPlease leave some closing words for Rickey Paulding.\n\n\n\nRickey was an awesome player but a much better dad and person. I got to experience some great times with him off the court and enjoyed those moments. He will be a legend in Oldenburg and the BBL will miss him dearly. Congrats on the amazing career and enjoy your family and retirement."}]}
