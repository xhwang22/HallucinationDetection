{"Riccardo Tisci studied at the London College of Fashion and Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design.": [{"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/sep/14/interview-burberry-designer-riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "On the evening I interview Burberry\u2019s chief creative officer Riccardo Tisci, London has an atmosphere close to boiling point. A stone\u2019s throw away from the brand\u2019s HQ, Boris Johnson has just entered 10 Downing Street for the first time, to jeers from protesters. Anti-Brexit demonstrators roam Parliament Square. Commuters on their way home try to manage the late July heatwave, some with ice lollies, others with pints. Some have given up entirely and are just sitting on the pavement, totally frazzled.\n\nFrazzled is not a word that gets much use at the top of Burberry Towers. The rooftop is all members\u2019 club discretion \u2013 bleached wood furniture, bowls of gigantic roses and perfectly chilled, iced sparkling water. The designer has specified this location, where some might have suggested their office, maybe, or a carefully chosen buzzy restaurant. If Burberry is a brand based on a very British weather system of cloudy with a chance of rain, Tisci is different. Born near Lake Como in Italy, he\u2019s accustomed to sunshine.\n\nThis becomes clear when he sits down and launches into his summer plans. \u201cI am going to Como to celebrate my birthday,\u201d he says. \u201cThen Mykonos\u2026 Me and all best friends who live in different countries, we meet there in August. A nice villa in the middle of nowhere\u2026 I love it. If you want to go and eat fish, you go and eat fish; if you want to sleep, you sleep; or if you want to get drunk all together \u2013 it\u2019s nice. The sea, the food, the fish, the tomatoes, everything.\u201d These words tumble out of Tisci\u2019s mouth, and he finishes with a grin, and a sip of the iced coffee he arrived with. Anyone after more of this scenario would do well to join 2.5m others and follow Tisci on Instagram. This year\u2019s destinations include a boat in Ibiza (he is pictured topless, wetsuit pulled down to his waist) and New York for Pride (surrounded by friends, all in hotpants). Or look up his 40th birthday in Ibiza \u2013 a decadent affair with Kate Moss, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Naomi Campbell attending.\n\n\u2018When you do well for yourself in France you get the Chanel bag, in England you get the Burberry trench\u2019. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nToday, like most days, the gym-honed 45-year-old \u2013 \u201cI am Leo with a moon ascending Gemini\u201d \u2013 wears a black T-shirt of his own design with TB (Thomas Burberry) logo, black basketball shorts and well-worn, even slightly bobbly, black Nike socks with swoosh. He carries a Burberry bumbag with a packet of American Spirit peeking out. If you didn\u2019t know he was a designer, you might think he worked in the music industry.\n\nThis look signals that Tisci is a departure for Burberry. Google Image Christopher Bailey, the previous chief creative officer for 17 years, and you\u2019ll see what I mean. Bailey is much more a crisp shirt and occasional blazer kind of man, the uniform of the discreetly wealthy. Bailey\u2019s collections reflected this taste, too. They often came with a blue-chip British bookish reference \u2013 the Bloomsbury group, say, or David Hockney \u2013 and a BBC Radio 6 Music-approved sound: Paloma Faith, Keane, Jake Bugg. Samantha Cameron and Kate Middleton wore the clothes.\n\nAnd Bailey\u2019s Burberry was successful. Thanks to him, the brand is now Proper Fashion, with the London fashion week show a hot ticket every season. But Bailey\u2019s Burberry was not really cool. Tisci, by contrast, is one of fashion\u2019s current arbiters of that intangible quality. Previously the creative director of Givenchy for 12 years, he designed the wedding outfits for his good friends Kanye and Kim, and has a long-running collaboration with Nike. Madonna, Frank Ocean and Marina Abramovi\u0107 are part of his friendship group (he bought a house with the artist). Since Tisci joined Burberry last year, the brand has worked with MIA (even persuading the edgy musician to appear in the slightly cheesy format of a Christmas advert) and dressed Gen Z favourites Ariana Grande, Rihanna and Gigi Hadid. Such is Tisci\u2019s influence that model Freja Beha Erichsen \u2013 who is Kind of a Big Deal in fashion, with 24 Vogue covers to her name and a starring role in Burberry\u2019s autumn ad campaign \u2013 rejigged her schedule to be part of this shoot.\n\nRiccardo Tisci with his good friends Kanye West and Madonna. Photograph: Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAt Givenchy, Tisci turned a couture relic most associated with Audrey Hepburn\u2019s LBDs into the height of millennial cool \u2013 specifically appealing to the hypebeast demographic who might also wear streetwear labels Supreme and Palace. Originally known for his gothic aesthetic, streetwear started appearing on the catwalk around 2011. Hypebeasts swiftly signed up \u2013 they loved the T-shirts with a snarling rottweiler print, the basketball vests, the plaid shirt with studs. And at around \u00a3360 for one of those T-shirts, they were within reach \u2013 more affordable than a four-figure gown, anyway. This was part of the strategy \u2013 that, and his duties as a good uncle. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go home for Christmas and have my sisters\u2019 kids say, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, what you do, but I can\u2019t afford it,\u2019\u201d Tisci explains. \u201cThat killed me. I wanted them to come to me and say, \u2018I have been saving money to buy the Bambi T-shirt.\u2019\n\n\u201c[At first], nobody was caring about it. Slowly but slowly, it was selling, selling, getting bigger,\u201d Tisci continues. \u201c[Then] everybody wants a piece and everybody starts doing it. I don\u2019t mind it because whenever the younger generation talk about that, they always mention my name.\u201d Tisci\u2019s success meant high street brands started producing their own take. You might not know his name but he is the reason you have a statement sweatshirt, the reason the phrase \u201cposh tracksuit trousers\u201d is not an oxymoron.\n\nReworking the check. Tisci\u2019s Burberry designs bring the classic to the radar of a new generation.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that Tisci is intrigued by a part of Burberry\u2019s history that was, until now, a touchy subject: its association with \u201cchav\u201d culture. In 2002, actor Danniella Westbrook was snapped in a Burberry check skirt with matching handbag. Her daughter wore a matching kilt, and sat in a Burberry check pushchair. The label was also spotted on football terraces. By being associated with the working-classes, the luxury brand was seen as losing its way. While check had already been reintroduced by Bailey, with a 2018 collaboration with streetwear designer Gosha Rubchinskiy, Tisci has reassessed the idea of \u201cchav\u201d. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t say it, but last season it was a little bit the inspiration,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it is great because I come from the streets.\u201d The AW collection, entitled Tempest, included streetwear, sophisticated classics and that oh-so-familiar check, reworked with a darker khaki and the punchy graphics that Tisci fans flock to.\n\nDesigners from humble backgrounds are nothing new \u2013 Alexander McQueen, Vivienne Westwood, Bailey himself - but Tisci has a genuine rags to riches story. Born in 1974, he grew up the youngest child \u2013 and only boy \u2013 of nine children. He wore his sisters\u2019 pink hand-me-downs to school. His father died when Tisci was four and the siblings had to work to keep the family afloat. He has spoken before about one meal a day being the norm, how he was helping his uncle with plastering from the age of 11. It\u2019s all a long way from rooftops with a view of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nTisci\u2019s unlikely success is, he says, down to \u201cangels I have crossed in my life\u201d. The first arrived when he stopped attending primary school. \u201cThe teachers came to my house, Miss Besio and Mr Borriero. They said to my mum, \u2018Your son needs to study because he has something different to all the other children.\u2019\u201d Tisci stayed in school. This continued in London \u2013 on an internship, fellow designer Antonio Berardi saw his illustrations and sent Tisci to renowned fashion college Central Saint Martins. While there, tutor Willie Walters ensured he received a grant so he was able to study. Tisci was made creative director of Givenchy in 2005, aged 29. \u201cI am a self-made person,\u201d he says now, with a drag of an American Spirit. \u201cMy mum gave me love but that is the only thing she gave me.\u201d (Tisci is prone to these telenovela-ish soundbites, which is understandable when you find out he has a story worthy of a box set.)\n\nRihanna wears a Burberry trench on stage at a Fenty Beauty event. Photograph: Mark Ganzon/Getty\n\nTisci sees a kindred spirit in Thomas Burberry, who started the eponymous brand in 1856, at the age of 21, in the far from fashionable environs of Basingstoke. He invented gabardine, the waterproof fabric that went on to be used for the trenchcoat, in 1879. Adopted by explorers and intrepid types including Ernest Shackleton and Betty Kirby-Green, Burberry trenches were worn in the trenches in the first world war. By 1965, it\u2019s said that one in every five coats exported from the UK was made by Burberry. These days, the brand employs around 10,000 people and is the only luxury fashion brand in the FTSE 100. It also looms large in British style. In the time I have been working on this interview, I have seen Tisci-designed Burberry tote bags on the tube, the check on a woman\u2019s scarf in the supermarket, a trench, with rolled-up check sleeves, in a cocktail bar.\n\nTisci says Thomas is central to his reworking of Burberry, so much so that he changed the Burberry logo \u2013 with the help of Peter Saville \u2013 to feature the founder\u2019s initials. \u201cThe company should still be an institution but at the same time we need to have the perception of human,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only a business company.\u201d That may seem a bit soppy to any board members reading this, but his nose for hits is well-known \u2013 Burberry\u2019s share price went up 5% when his appointment was announced. There\u2019s still work to do, though: even after a 4% rise in sales, analysts at the Bernstein Group downgraded Burberry to \u201cunderperform\u201d in August.\n\nTisci\u2019s track record for courting millennials suggests this is just a blip. He\u2019s started Burberry\u2019s B Series which plays into the \u201cdrop\u201d culture of streetwear \u2013 a new product is released on the 17th of each month (August\u2019s was a dog hoodie, personalisable with the lucky pooch\u2019s name), and reliably sells out in minutes. Another addition is T-shirts, scarves and bags covered in unicorns. If that sounds like a cynical ploy to appeal to fans of emojis and pool inflatables, the story has the authenticity this cohort highly prizes. A search of the archive revealed an alternative insignia from the brand\u2019s famous knight \u2013 a unicorn, designed by Burberry for his family. \u201cIn the day it was a horse, in the night it became a unicorn,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cI thought it was a very beautiful thing. In a way, it\u2019s very relatable to what happened in my life\u2026 My sisters were like Thomas Burberry. During the day, they have to be strong warriors, but in the night they would take off all this armour and be very sweet mothers to me.\u201d\n\nFamily comes first for Tisci. He remains very close to his mother, who is now 90. His formative experiences of fashion came from watching his eight sisters \u2013 who, he says, are four pairs of best friends \u2013 get ready to go out, when he was a child. \u201cThey would be in the bathroom, putting makeup on. I was sitting on the bathtub thinking, one day I can go out and meet the people around the world.\u201d\n\nTisci has said before that he took the Givenchy job so he could buy his mother a house. His break with the brand was also prompted by family \u2013 at the funeral of his brother-in-law in 2016, he realised his mother was getting older, his nieces and nephews were growing up. And he wanted in. \u201cI wanted to be the son of my mother, the brother of my sister, that I have never been really because life never gave me the opportunity,\u201d he says. He quit Givenchy the following spring. The announcement went out while he was in a desert in Algeria, with his phone switched off.\n\nSitting back. Model Freja Beha Erichsen wearing Burberry. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nThe next year was low-key. He had, he says, \u201cno agenda\u201d. \u201cLike anyone when you are busy, you have a PA, a PR,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you want to go to buy your toothpaste, you want to discover what is the new cream for your skin, not always have somebody going for you.\u201d He slept a lot and he travelled, going to Portugal with his family and backpacking around Costa Rica. That is, until Burberry called. Tisci was brought back to fashion by the man who brought him into it in the first place \u2013 Marco Gobbetti, now CEO of Burberry (with an annual salary of \u00a37.3m, as was recently revealed), but then at Givenchy. \u201cMarco is the person who saved my career and gave me the opportunity to be who I am today,\u201d Tisci says, with that frisson of drama. The trench was also enticing. \u201cWhen you behave well at school, in France you get the Chanel bag,\u201d he says. \u201cIn England you get the Burberry trench. It\u2019s something I discovered here. Adele told me the first thing she bought when her first single came out was a Burberry trench.\u201d Tisci\u2019s first collection for Burberry featured 20 trenches.\n\nBut will the perception of a brand \u2013 and an item \u2013 so associated with Britishness change post-Brexit? \u201cBritish is not my culture but I am representing a very important British house,\u201d Tisci says. \u201cFor me to celebrate Britishness and bring it to America, China, it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nI would guess Tisci was Remain \u2013 inclusivity and diversity are his MO. He championed casting people of colour well before the rest of fashion woke up to the idea. He also cast his friend Lea T, a trans woman, in an ad campaign in 2010, helping her financially and opening the door to models such as Hari Nef, Andreja Pejic and Nathan Westling. \u201cI got so much shit. You cannot imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cThank God we had people like Oprah Winfrey who said, \u2018Stop a second, he is doing something that is right.\u2019 When somebody more powerful says something, it changes.\u201d Family Tisci were a support network, too. \u201cWhen she [Lea T] decided to become a woman and her family didn\u2019t accept her, my mum took her to our house and she lived with us,\u201d he says. \u201cShe treated Lea as a daughter. Lea still says, \u2018Your mum is the first person to call me she, not he.\u2019\u201d\n\nTisci is definitely an ally to a socially aware generation (Burberry\u2019s policy of burning clothes and its use of fur ended soon after he joined). But he doesn\u2019t always get it right. There was a skirmish after the autumn show when model Liz Kennedy compared the fastening on a hoodie to a noose on social media. \u201cSuicide is not fashion,\u201d she wrote. \u201cRiccardo Tisci and everyone at Burberry it is beyond me how you could let a look resembling a noose hanging from a neck out on the runway.\u201d While other brands have seen items that cause offence reach stores \u2013 both Gucci and Prada have had scandals around designs with racist imagery \u2013 this was swiftly shut down. In a statement, Tisci said, \u201cIt does not reflect my values nor Burberry\u2019s and we have removed it from the collection.\u201d\n\nThe good ship Burberry: Tisci brings a twist to Burberry\u2019s heritage with graphic prints and a new logo. Photograph: Shaniqwa Jarvis/The Guardian\n\nWhile Tisci says he isn\u2019t a political person, he does concede he has a platform. \u201cIf it\u2019s to fight for rights, to help people, I am the first one,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s about going to sit at a table and talk about money, numbers and power, that is, like you say here, not my cup of tea.\u201d\n\nNow back in London for over a year, Tisci lives in Mayfair (he did consider Marylebone, where his friend Madonna has a house), trains every day in a local gym and watches what he eats. Then, once in a while, he lets himself go. Tisci has gone to raves, festivals \u2013 \u201cI never thought I would be a festival person\u201d \u2013 and gigs: Rosal\u00eda, the buzzy Spanish singer, Bj\u00f6rk, Primal Scream. The evening we speak, he is having drinks with singer Dua Lipa. Next up, his birthday, celebrated quietly with family. I\u2019m not taking his word for it \u2013 it\u2019s all documented on Instagram a few days later. The designer looks content, lake in the background, Aperol spritz on the table, surrounded by his sisters and mother. Rooftops in London are all very well but for Tisci, there\u2019s still no place like home."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/riccardo-tisci-burberry-interview", "page_content": "Burberry's new-look trench coat, photographed by Willy Vanderperre for Vogue's February 2019 issue. Willy vanderperre\n\nIf anyone knows how to inject youth into the veins of a house, it is the man who first turned sweatshirts into luxury fashion staples. Here was his reinvigoration of a brand that has spent years seeking to appeal to a new generation, and it\u2019s already paying dividends: the early drops of limited-edition products arriving in store on the 17th of each month have been sell-outs. \u201cI want to sustain the Burberry heritage, but I also want to go with the times, with modernity,\u201d he says of that evolution. \u201cI want people to come to Burberry and buy a beautiful trench, a beautiful car coat, a beautiful suit, a beautiful evening dress, beautiful trainers. Not just one product; I want to make it more open, more democratic.\u201d That diverse appeal is surely set for commercial success, and his understanding of how to dress different demographics - men and women of all colours, shapes and inclinations - is what makes Tisci such a strong candidate to lead British design into a new era.\n\nwilly vanderperre\n\nHe\u2019s yet to take a breath - when we speak, he\u2019s still holed up in a Mayfair hotel while trying to navigate the landscape of a city that has transformed in the years since he last called it home, and determine everything from which neighbourhood to move into to what our nightlife looks like now - but he is electric with anticipation for a new chapter. In these curious times, he notes, the capital seems quieter than it did during his last stay here. \u201cI\u2019m trying to find again the freedom of expression of the young generation. Right now, people are on standby as they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening \u2013 and whatever will be decided will bring both good and bad,\u201d he reflects. \u201cBut it will also bring certainty. Remember, after crisis is always the best moment... I\u2019m sure that soon there will be freedom again.\u201d Here was his own, united vision of this kingdom\u2019s past - but, more importantly, its future."}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/people/riccardo-tisci", "page_content": "Riccardo Tisci is an Italian designer, renowned for his work at Givenchy, a French house that Tisci resurrected to its former profitable glory and his latest work at Burbery. Impressively, the designer crafted distinct brand identities for all of Givenchy\u2019s product categories across women\u2019s and men\u2019s ready-to-wear and haute couture lines. At Burberry, he lifted sales after faltering period, and revamping the company's brand identity.\n\nTisci grew up in a tight-knit, single-parent, working-class family in Italy. The designer describes his family life as hugely influential on him and remembers his childhood as one filled with love. Tisci left regular school aged 11 to enroll in art school in Milan. \u201cI wanted to express myself and I couldn't really do it through words at that point,\" he told The Daily Telegraph. The designer was selected for a scholarship by Central Saint Martins, from which he graduated in 1999. He then held design positions at Puma, Antonio Berardi and with Ruffo Research, before embarking on his own brand in 2004. As a result of his bold, powerfully-feminine designs, Tisci was announced as the creative director of Givenchy\u2019s womenswear and haute couture lines in 2005. After announcing his amicable departure from the house in February 2017 with a subsequent sabbatical, Tisci was named chief creative officer at Burberry in March 2018, succeeding Christopher Bailey .\n\nTisci\u2019s creations found willing consumers immediately; the designer\u2019s vision for Givenchy initially found traction with consumers rather than editors. In just two years Tisci had revitalised the house\u2019s couture business. He chose to stop showing couture in 2012, taking the business behind the scenes in-house once more.\n\nIn May 2008 he was appointed chief designer of menswear and menswear accessories in addition to his womenswear role. His menswear collections have received rampant critical acclaim and caused the formation of tribe-like followers, many of whom, such as Kanye West, are very much in the public eye. Tisci\u2019s marriage of streetwear influences, Parisian sensibilities and global motifs made Givenchy\u2019s printed sweatshirts a fashion staple, as well as broadening the brand\u2019s appeal exponentially.\n\nFollowing over a decade of experience at the creative helm of Givenchy, Tisci transitioned to Burberry, an announcement that sent share prices soaring by over 5 percent. Joining Marco Gobetti a second time, who also joined Burberry as its chief executive following a stint at Givenchy, Tisci took on plans to reinvigorate product and consumer experiences and expand Burberry's first venture into high end streetwear after a partnership with Gosha Rubchinsky in 2018. Under Tisci's watch, both Burberry's London flagship location and it's monogram logo underwent a revamp, the latter of which debuted with a series of international pop-up installations featuring the new Peter Saville -designed Burberry logo. Following the highly anticipated first Spring/Summer 2019 collection and logo redesign, Burberry reported a 4 percent rise in first quarter comparable store sales in 2019."}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/burberry-vivienne-westwood-riccardo-tisci-collaboration", "page_content": "In an age when collaborations are a dime a dozen, this one might be one of the most unexpected and exciting: Vivienne Westwood is collaborating with Burberry.

This is Tisci\u2019s Rosebud\u2014the key to understanding what makes him tick. \u201cSo many things are important,\u201d says Tisci, \u201cbut I really believe in family. I believe in a relationship, a gang.\u201d Beyond his blood relatives, there is his close-knit six-person Givenchy design team (\u201clike a little tiny family\u201d) and his posse of intimate girlfriends: the elfin model Mariacarla Boscono (\u201cshe\u2019s got an energy and a charisma that\u2019s major\u201d), Carine Roitfeld, an early proselytizer for his talent and a poster girl for his Goth-chic aesthetic, and the artist Marina Abramovi\u00b4c (\u201ca very pure person\u201d). Tisci\u2019s relationship with Abramovi\u00b4c is so symbiotic that together they bought a nineteenth-century brownstone in Manhattan\u2019s West Village, which they divide laterally, and the artist, an ageless 65, depicted herself suckling Tisci for the powerful sixtieth edition of Visionaire, which he edited, dedicated to \u201cReligion\u201d and, of course, celebrating family. Then there are the women he admires and dresses: Madonna (whose costumes he designed for her Sticky & Sweet tour in 2008), Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Naomi Campbell, Courtney Love, Florence Welch, and Rihanna among them.\n\nThe Tisci family story goes something like this: In gritty, war-ravaged Taranto, Puglia, in the heel of Italy, a seventeen-year-old girl from a relatively well-to-do latifundis (land-owning) family met a nineteen-year-old boy from the wrong side of the tracks. They met once, on the street, and fell in love. Her parents forbade them to meet again, but they would communicate furtively through a window at the back of her house, and he told her that he would give her a train ticket to Milan, a city he knew, where she was to find a hotel and a job. He would join her when the next train for Milan left Taranto, a week or so later. She knotted up her rosary and her Bible and her few precious things in a handkerchief and dutifully did as instructed. But it was six weeks before he tracked her down; he had the money for only one ticket, which he had given to the girl he loved but did not know, and thus he had to walk more than 600 miles to a city he had, in truth, never been to before. The couple were undaunted, even though their first home was a garage. They had eight daughters and, finally, a longed-for boy. Tisci\u2019s father, who prospered importing fruit from the fecund south, built a family house in Como, but he died young, barely remembered by his four-year-old son, who would grow up in his exact image, like one of Caravaggio\u2019s broodingly handsome, raven-haired urchin angels.\n\nClick here to read more information on Riccardo Tisci on Voguepedia.com."}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/riccardo-tisci-leaves-givenchy-as-versace-rumours-intensify/", "page_content": "LONDON, United Kingdom \u2014 Riccardo Tisci is exiting Givenchy after 12 years in the role of creative director, as rumours intensify that the designer will join Versace.\n\nTisci, who is credited with resurrecting Givenchy with his dark, sensual and subversive collections, is reported to have left the LVMH-owned couture house on January 31 when his contract ended. His last collection for Givenchy was shown in January at Couture Week in Paris. As a result of his departure, the brand will not hold a runway show during Paris Fashion Week.\n\n\"The chapter Riccardo Tisci has written with the house of Givenchy over the last 12 years represents an incredible vision to sustain its continuous success, and I would like to warmly thank him for his core contribution to the house's development,\" said Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH in a statement.\n\n\u201cI have very special affection for the House of Givenchy and its beautiful teams,\" Tisci added. \"I want to thank the LVMH group and Monsieur Bernard Arnault for giving me the platform to express my creativity over the years. I now wish to focus on my personal interests and passions.\u201d\n\nLVMH said in a statement that the new creative organisation of Givenchy will be communicated at a later date.\n\nDuring his time at Givenchy, Tisci breathed much-needed life into the brand's womenswear, menswear and accessories.\n\nTisci left his hometown of Taranto, southern Italy to study at Central Saint Martins in London, graduating in 1999. He returned to Italy to work for a number of brands including Antonio Berardi, Coccapani, Puma and Ruffo Research. In September 2004 he set up an eponymous ready-to-wear label, showing his first collection in Milan for the Autumn/Winter 2005 season, which caught the attention of press and LVMH executives, who hired Tisci to replace Julien Macdonald as creative director of Givenchy in February 2005.\n\nThroughout his tenure, Tisci has pushed the boundaries of one of France\u2019s most storied couture houses, which was largely associated with its founder\u2019s close relationship with actress Audrey Hepburn, who was a lifelong client and enlisted Hubert de Givenchy to design many of her iconic Hollywood costumes.\n\nAs well as designing highly embellished collections of haute couture, the Italian designer achieved notoriety for distinctive graphic sweatshirts, sneakers and sportswear-inspired garments. In 2010, he cast the Brazilian transgender model Lea T to walk in his ready-to-wear show \u2014 as well as booking her for the advertising campaign.\n\nOther notable highlights have included his enduring relationships with artists Marina Abramovi\u0107, Madonna and Beyonc\u00e9, as well as the album artwork he designed for \"Watch The Throne\", Kanye West and Jay Z's Grammy-winning 2011 collaboration. Tisci was one of the first Paris-based fashion designers to embrace Kim Kardashian West and her extended family, eventually designing her wedding dress in 2014.\n\nGivenchy is credited with being one of LVMH's most successful luxury brands though the company does not disclose separate figures for each house. However, in its annual results last week, LVMH reported that its fashion and leather division grew by 8 percent in the fourth quarter, beating analyst estimates."}, {"url": "https://www.businessoffashion.com/opinions/news-analysis/will-riccardo-tisci-work-at-burberry/", "page_content": "LONDON, United Kingdom \u2014 When the white smoke finally appeared from the Burberry chimneys on who would replace Christopher Bailey as chief creative officer, even the deliberations of the Vatican conclave could not have provoked such a collective gasp of astonishment. Riccardo Tisci, previously creative director at Givenchy, was not one of the most touted names like Kim Jones and Phoebe Philo, although as the weeks passed and speculation grew more frenzied to fill the vacuum, there was barely a designer who hadn't been discussed for the role.\n\nTisci, who left Givenchy in February 2017, would seem to be an explosive choice for Burberry, a brand that has been transformed from a languishing heritage name, mired in unloved duty-free outlets and a worn-out check, into one of fashion\u2019s big success stories.\n\nWhile Burberry \u2014 first under American businesswoman Rose Marie Bravo who installed Bailey as designer and then under the double-act of Angela Ahrendts as chief executive and Bailey as creative director \u2014 focused on its distinctive British heritage, Tisci's track record shows his heart to be in a dark, gothic sensibility laced with a subversive southern Mediterranean soul. At Givenchy, he took a house that epitomised bon-ton Parisian style and churned it up by bringing overtly sexual dressing, piercings, transgender models and a hard-edged urban romanticism to the fore. His gang of famous fans include Courtney Love, Beyonc\u00e9 and The Kardashians.\n\nIn contrast, Burberry has invested hugely in forging an identity that is quite the opposite. Taking the gabardine fabric invented by Thomas Burberry in 1856, Bailey referenced a particular kind of Britishness to build the Burberry brand. The royal family and middle-market minstrels like James Bay were friends of the house, and the stores were revamped to be comfortable and sociable. The long-term marketing collaboration with Mario Testino produced a polished but irreverent take on British style, building the careers of unashamedly well born models like Cara Delevingne, Stella Tennant, Adwoa Aboah and Jean Campbell as well as embracing London stalwarts such as Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell. While Bailey paid tribute to the LGBTQ community a few weeks ago at his final catwalk show, it has more usually been local heroes like Henry Moore, The Charleston Art Group, David Hockney and the temperamental British weather that have provided inspiration for his collections.\n\nWhat happens at Burberry is of great relevance beyond the house.\n\nWhile Burberry is regarded as a status buy and defines itself as a \"global luxury brand,\" it has also been determinedly inclusive. Initiatives like The Art of The Trench, one of their first successful digital campaigns showing everyday people wearing Burberry trench coats, opened the brand up to a wider audience. The shift to \"see now, buy now\" was intended to make the shows more relevant to the public, although it was a limited commercial success.\n\nIn general, Burberry\u2019s USP, along with its Britishness, is that it is an aspirational brand, but unintimidating and accessible. You don\u2019t have to be part of some rarified fashion cognoscenti to wear it. It\u2019s not about some crazy waiting list-driven mentality. Isn\u2019t that the whole point? Isn\u2019t Burberry the ultimate small-town boy made good, with a recognisable appeal and identity throughout the world?\n\nBut we are living in a fashion era when brands seem to be regarded as empty vessels that can be filled with an entirely new set of contents at any whim. The buzzword \u201cdisruption\u201d\u2014 surely soon itself to become an outmoded concept \u2014 allows all manner of change to take place, often with little connection to what came before.\n\nThe appointment of Tisci is part of a broader elevation strategy announced by new chief Marco Gobbetti. The pair worked together at Givenchy before Gobbetti left for C\u00e9line (ironically another brand that looks to be ditching its hard-earned identity by replacing Phoebe Philo with Hedi Slimane) and he can no doubt manage Tisci's creative originality, which is matched by a strong determination not to be cramped by any corporate or managerial pressure.\n\nWe are living in a fashion era when brands seem to be regarded as empty vessels that can be filled with an entirely new set of contents at any whim.\n\nHe will be aware that in the current climate, Tisci, an early supporter of broader diversity in fashion, will be seen as someone with his finger on the pulse and will have convinced his board of the worth of that positioning. Gobbetti will also have noted Tisci's brilliance at streetwear-infused fashion and his work with leather, not to mention the booming high-end trainers market and the gender fluid sportswear, both trends of which Tisci is a founding father. The recent appointment of Virgil Abloh as men's artistic director at Louis Vuitton is part of a similar trend.\n\nIt will not only be Gobbetti and the board but the eyes of a great many who will be watching, because what happens at Burberry is of great relevance beyond the house. While Burberry, like many luxury brands, has been suffering a sales slowdown, they are still one of industry\u2019s biggest players and, in that capacity, have become an essential pillar of London Fashion Week and, to no small extent, the general perception of British fashion.\n\nThere is no other brand that has anything like the pulling power and financial clout that has helped London Fashion Week become a real force in the show calendar. The presence of a huge global fashion community at Burberry's shows has benefitted the many talented, smaller designers who show during this period but who alone cannot draw such a crowd. Other high profile British brands like Stella McCartney and Alexander McQueen have never been prepared to stake their all on London Fashion Week, preferring to commit to one-off pop-up events, but Burberry has pitched its tent (literally) on the home turf and brought a real status to the proceedings.\n\nTisci is a graduate of Central Saint Martins and a huge fan of the cultural mix that is London. When we last met for a coffee on Avenue Georges V in Paris in early 2017, he spoke of a plan to bring the Givenchy Spring/Summer 2018 ready-to-wear to the city that September. A few months later he had left the French house. Now, he is joining an institution that is much a part of our national heritage as bangers and mash. How it is going to taste with a hefty dollop of salsa diavolo is going to be intriguing to see. For Burberry to flourish as it needs to, Tisci will need to play to the broad-based appeal that gives the brand its unique slot in the fashion universe.\n\nAlexandra Shulman is an author and the former editor of British Vogue.\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n[ Why Burberry Chose Riccardo Tisci ]\n\n[ Unpacking Burberry\u2019s New Strategy ]\n\n[ The Risks of Changing Creative Directors ]"}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/riccardo-tisci-life-in-looks", "page_content": "After bowing out of his creative directorship at Burberry with a goth-at-the-beach spring/summer 2023 show and Shakira-fronted Christmas campaign, Riccardo Tisci is taking a break. But don\u2019t think he\u2019s forgotten about the industry completely. Already, the designer has fashioned his first solo work in 17 years for friend Michaela Coel and now, he\u2019s sifted through his vast archive to compile his Life in Looks for British Vogue. For a man who has collaborated with Madonna, Beyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna, and calls Naomi Campbell and Mariacarla Boscono muses and sisters, this is no mean feat. It was also, says Tisci, highly emotional.\n\nWhile there have been obvious professional highs \u2013 including the first Riccardo Tisci show, which saw friends Karen Elson and Liya Kebede model his anti-polished, pro-gothic looks for free, and Givenchy\u2019s anniversary show during which the rain clouds parted and a glorious sunset backdropped his darkly sensual work \u2013 many of the Italian\u2019s creatives wins are deeply personal. He accepted that coveted Givenchy contract in 2005, for example, not because of the prestige, but because of the pay cheque that would enable him to save his mother from selling the family home to make ends meet.\n\nTisci\u2019s collaboration with Nike, back when it was unheard of for a couturier to elevate sportswear into high fashion, was also rooted in a childhood where a simple pair of trainers acted as a great leveller and allowed him to fit in. And so, years down the line, when industry outsider Kim Kardashian was not considered in vogue, it was Tisci who stepped forward to dress the then-heavily pregnant reality TV star for the 2013 Met Gala \u2013 an event she was only allowed to attend as the plus one of Kanye West. The blossoming rose gown he made was symbolic of the woman he saw: a strong individual expressing one of the most powerful acts of femininity.\n\nIt is unsurprising, then, that before Tisci\u2019s next move (a new vacancy at Gucci has just become available), he is taking stock of his core values: making his new house in London a home, spending time with the eight sisters who shaped him and, he reveals, \u201ctrying to have a child\u201d. Rather than jumping into the next project, \u201csimplicity\u201d is the biggest trend in Tisci\u2019s life right now \u2013 and it looks good. Watch the designer talk through every major stepping stone on his journey so far, below."}]}
