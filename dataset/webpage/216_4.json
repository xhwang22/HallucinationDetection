He established UCLA's single-game rebounding record, totaling 28 rebounds in a game against Arizona State on Jan. 28, 1956. His record still stands today.\n\n\n\nThrough three varsity seasons at UCLA, Naulls averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game. He secured All-America honors after his senior season.\n\n\n\nWhen he had finished playing at UCLA, Naulls had established the program's all-time scoring record (1,225 points in three seasons). He currently ranks No. 40 on the Bruins' all-time scoring list and No. 7 on the all-time rebounds list. Naulls led the Bruins in rebounding in each of his three seasons on the varsity team.\n\n\n\nNaulls was an all-conference selection (Pacific Coast Conference) in 1955 and 1956.\n\n\n\nAfter a remarkable collegiate career, Naulls was selected in the second round of the NBA Draft by the St. Louis Hawks. He enjoyed a 10-year NBA career, competing for St. Louis, the New York Knicks, the San Francisco Warriors and the Boston Celtics. He became the first former UCLA player to lead his team to the NBA Finals. Boston advanced to the finals and won the NBA Championship in 1964, 1965 and 1966 (Naulls' final three NBA seasons).\n\n\n\nNaulls, along with Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones and Tom Sanders, became the first all-African-American starting team in the history of integrated professional sports in Dec. 1964, when Naulls replaced injured Tom Heinsohn in the starting lineup.\n\n\n\nChoosing to retire from the NBA after leading Boston to the 1966 NBA Championship, Naulls returned to Los Angeles and completed his undergraduate degree at UCLA. Naulls was inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\n\n\nIn 1981, the NCAA honored Naulls with the Silver Anniversary Award, bestowed upon five former student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their collegiate eligibility. While the award factors in an individual's athletic accomplishments, the Silver Anniversary Award also uses professional accomplishments and philanthropic work as criteria.\n\n\n\nAfter his basketball career had ended, Naulls worked with youth for over five decades. He served young people growing up in communities similar to those of his childhood in San Pedro and Watts and founded a non-profit organization. The foundation raised funds to provide week-long free summer basketball camps on college campuses for junior high and high school boys, recommended by coaches in southern California.\n\n\n\nNaulls enrolled in Fuller Theological Seminary in 1990, earning a master's degree in theology in 1993. During that time, he worked as a college counselor for Brentwood Presbyterian Church. Later, he served as associate pastor for Antelope Valley Christian Center. In 1993, he incorporated Willie Naulls Ministries.\n\n\n\nNaulls is survived by his wife of 40 years, Anne Van de Water Naulls; his children Lisa, Shannon, Joanh and Malaika; and his grandchildren Celia, Michael, Dean, Jonathan, Elle and Jojo.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://uclabruins.com/honors/hall-of-fame/willie-naulls/282", "page_content": "Thanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"}, {"url": "https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/celtics/boston-celtics-pioneer-willie-naulls-passes-away-84", "page_content": "NEW ORLEANS \u2013 Willie Naulls, a three-time NBA champion with the Boston Celtics as well as a member of the first all-Black starting five in NBA history, passed away on Thanksgiving morning.\n\nHe was 84 years old.\n\nNaulls, who spent the bulk of his 10-year NBA career with the New York Knicks, is remembered fondly by his former Celtics teammate, Hall of Famer Tommy Heinsohn.\n\n\u201cWillie was a terrific player,\u201d Heinsohn told NBC Sports Boston in a phone interview. \u201cReally, a competitive guy.\u201d\n\nHeinsohn and Naulls will forever be linked together because it was Naulls who replaced a then-injured Heinsohn in Boston\u2019s starting lineup to form what became the first all-Black starting five.

These memories have directly influenced my life\u2019s commitment to serve young people of all ethnic backgrounds who would commit themselves to the pursuit of Truth and excellence. I was taught very early the value of a positive attitude about working toward becoming the best that I could be. Young people are our most valuable resource, and my life\u2019s goal is to bring together prepared and committed teachers who will share their specific knowledge and wisdom with youth who commit themselves to preparing to become positive and productive members of our society.\u201d\n\nClick here to download the new MyTeams App by NBC Sports!

He was a four-time NBA All-Star with the New York Knicks and won three NBA championships with the Boston Celtics.\n\nNaulls grew up in California, where he was named the state's Mr. Basketball in high school. He played college basketball with the UCLA Bruins, and earned All-American honors as a senior in 1956. Naulls was selected by the St. Louis Hawks (known now as the Atlanta Hawks) with the ninth overall pick of the 1956 NBA draft. He played briefly with St. Louis before being traded to New York, where he spent most of his career. With the Knicks, he became the first African American to be named a captain of a professional team in a major American sport. After a brief stint with the San Francisco Warriors (now the Golden State Warriors), Naulls finished his career with Boston. In December 1964, he was part of a Celtics unit that became the first all-black starting lineup in NBA history.\n\nEarly life Naulls was born in Dallas, Texas, to Daily and Bettie (Artis) Naulls. During World War II, the family moved to Los Angeles when he was nine to escape racial segregration. His father worked at shipyards in San Pedro, and his mother was a domestic worker. Naulls was a basketball star at San Pedro High, where he was named California Mr. Basketball in 1952.\n\nCollege career Naulls attended the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he played for the Bruins under future Basketball Hall of Fame coach John Wooden. In December 1954 during his junior year, UCLA won 47\u201340 over San Francisco, who were led by Naulls' future Boston teammates Bill Russell and K. C. Jones. Naulls outplayed Russell in the Dons' lone defeat of the season en route to their first of two consecutive national championships. As a senior in 1955\u201356, Naulls set the Bruins single-game rebounding record with 28 against Arizona State, and he finished the season with 582 field goal attempts to set the school's single-season record. UCLA won the Pacific Coast Conference championship and advanced to the NCAA Tournament that season, while Naulls was named a consensus second-team All-American. In his three seasons at UCLA, Naulls averaged 15.5 points and 11.4 rebounds per game. At the time his career ended, he was the Bruins' career leader in both points (1,225) and rebounds (900). He was inducted into the UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\nNBA career Naulls was selected by the St. Louis Hawks in second round of the 1956 NBA draft with the ninth overall pick. He called it a \"culture shock\" to see the segregation that existed in St. Louis, the likes of which he had not seen since he was eight before moving to Southern California. He spent just 19 games with the Hawks before being traded to the New York Knicks, with whom he would spend most of his career. Naulls averaged a double-double (19.3 points and 10.7 rebounds per game) during his seven-year tenure with the Knicks, and he appeared as an NBA All-Star four times. The Knicks named him their captain in 1960, making him the first African-American athlete to hold the position for any pro team in a major American sport. In 1960\u201361, Naulls scored a single-season team record of 1,846 points, averaging 23.4 points per game. The record was broken the following season by teammate Richie Guerin. On March 2, 1962, Naulls scored 31 points and established another team record with his seventh straight game scoring 30 points or more. In that same game, Philadelphia Warriors center Wilt Chamberlain notched his NBA record 100-point game against the Knicks. Naulls' 30+ streak stood until 2010, when it was broken by Amar'e Stoudemire. During the 1962\u201363 NBA season, the Knicks traded Naulls to the San Francisco Warriors, with whom he played briefly before being traded to the Boston Celtics. Naulls spent his last three professional seasons with the Celtics, winning three consecutive NBA championships in the process. In December 1964 against St. Louis, he replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn to form NBA's first all-black starting lineup along with Russell at center, K. C. and Sam Jones at the guards and Satch Sanders at forward. That 1964\u201365 Celtics team was named one of the 10 best teams in NBA history during the league's 50th anniversary.
