{"K\u00e9vin Gameiro won the UEFA Europa League in 2015 and 2016.": [{"url": "https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/447238", "page_content": "Sevilla stayed on course for a third straight Europa League title by claiming a 2-2 draw against Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine in the first leg of their semifinal.\n\nUnai Emery's side are looking to become the first to win a major European competition three years in a row since Bayern Munich 40 years ago.\n\nThey had to come from behind after Vitolo's early goal was cancelled out by Marlos and Taras Stepanenko, with Kevin Gameiro's late penalty giving them two vital away goals.\n\nAnd, given their superb home record, Sevilla will fancy their chances of reaching yet another final.\n\nThe contrast between Emery's team at home and away is remarkable, with Sevilla managing just one win on their travels in Europe and none in the Primera Division.\n\nBut it took only six minutes for the Spaniards to take the lead in Lviv. Gameiro released Vitolo and he was allowed to turn inside by Yaroslav Rakitskiy before finding the net.\n\nShakhtar responded positively and David Soria saved from Marlos before the Brazilian levelled matters in the 23rd minute.\n\nShakhtar Donetsk scored twice, but let it two in Thursday's first leg. Alex Grimm - UEFA/UEFA via Getty Images\n\nRakitskiy made up for his error by playing a terrific ball for Marlos, who was allowed acres of space to run through and finish with aplomb.\n\nThe teams last met in Europe nine years ago when Sevilla goalkeeper Andres Palop dramatically equalised at the death, with the Spanish side going on to win the title.\n\nShakhtar would lift the trophy two years later but had not reached the semifinals again until now.\n\nTheir tails were certainly up and with 35 minutes on the clock the Ukrainians took the lead.\n\nA short corner was worked to Marlos, who swung in a cross with such pace that Stepanenko needed only to get his head on it to beat Soria.\n\nSevilla needed to improve after the break and they did. Daniel Carrico forced Andriy Pyatov into a save, the keeper awkwardly pushing the low drive away.\n\nSubstitute Michael Krohn-Dehli then tested Pyatov again as the pressure mounted but the visitors were dealt a blow when the Dane suffered what appeared a serious knee injury.\n\nGameiro thought he had equalised in the 75th minute but his celebrations were halted by an offside flag, and moments later the Frenchman shot over when well placed.\n\nThe threat was growing and Sevilla seemed certain to score when Vitolo beat Pyatov but Olexandr Kucher somehow cleared the ball over the bar from on the line with Gameiro lurking.\n\nBut, with 82 minutes on the clock, the visitors had their equaliser. Facundo Ferreyra fouled Vitolo as he tried to cut inside on the right of the box and Gameiro confidently netted the penalty.\n\nSevilla might have won the game but Rakitskiy produced a vital block to deny Ever Banega."}, {"url": "https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/0281-1812b378a6df-8ec4e172f0bc-1000--sevilla-s-seven-final-wins/", "page_content": "Sevilla have added yet another UEFA Europa League title to their collection, coming from behind to see off Roma on penalties in Budapest.\n\nThe Spanish side have now won the competition a record seven times, which is more than twice the haul of their nearest challengers (Inter, Liverpool, Juventus and Atl\u00e9tico have triumphed three times apiece).\n\nThe Andalusian outfit also possess a flawless record in finals, having never lost at this stage of the tournament. Here, UEFA.com looks back at all seven of Sevilla's past victories.\n\n2005/06 UEFA Cup final, Eindhoven: Middlesbrough 0-4 Sevilla\n\n2006 final highlights: Middlesbrough 0-4 Sevilla\n\nSevilla's first appearance in a major European final was a resounding success as they comfortably beat English side Middlesbrough in the Netherlands. Brazilian forward Lu\u00eds Fabiano got them off to the perfect start with a glancing header to put his team in front in the 27th minute.\n\nItalian midfielder Enzo Maresca scored a quickfire double late on before Sevilla's top scorer that season, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9, came off the bench to add a fourth and seal a highly impressive victory.\n\nStarting line-ups\n\nMiddlesbrough: Schwarzer; Parnaby, Riggott, Southgate, Queudrue; Morrison, Rochemback, Boateng, Downing; Viduka, Hasselbaink\n\nSevilla: Palop; Dani Alves, Javi Navarro, Escud\u00e9, David; Jes\u00fas Navas, Mart\u00ed, Maresca, Adriano; Lu\u00eds Fabiano, Saviola\n\nWhat they said\n\nJuande Ramos, Sevilla coach: \"I was quite calm, because the team was playing very well. They felt superior and very comfortable on the field, and the first goal had to come sooner or later. We were at a high level for the rest of the game. We beat them 4-0, something that doesn't usually happen in a European final.\"\n\nSteve McClaren, Middlesbrough manager: \"It was one match too far. Sevilla were head and shoulders above anyone in that competition. We took risks, but we got punished.\"\n\n2007 final highlights: Espanyol 2-2 Sevilla (1-3 pens)\n\nJust one year later, Sevilla were back again and became the first team to win consecutive UEFA Cups since Real Madrid (in 1985 and 1986) after triumphing on penalties in a dramatic all-Spanish final in Scotland.\n\nAdriano put them ahead with a superb solo effort after cutting in from the left wing, but Espanyol's Albert Riera equalised just ten minutes later to force extra time.\n\nKanout\u00e9 scored in his second final in a row to put the holders back in front, but Espanyol once again hit back through J\u00f4natas as the game went to penalties. Sevilla goalkeeper Andr\u00e9s Palop proved the hero, saving from Luis Garc\u00eda, J\u00f4natas and Marc Torrej\u00f3n to spark wild celebrations.\n\nStarting line-ups\n\nEspanyol: Gorka Iraizoz; Zabaleta, Jorque, Torrej\u00f3n, David Garc\u00eda; Rufete, Mois\u00e9s, \ufeffDe la Pe\u00f1a, Riera; Luis Garc\u00eda, Tamudo\n\nSevilla: Palop; Dani Alves, Navarro, Puerta, Dragutinovi\u0107; Mart\u00ed, Poulsen, Maresca, Adriano; Kanout\u00e9, Lu\u00eds Fabiano\n\nWhat they said\n\nJuande Ramos, Sevilla coach: \"It is a great satisfaction to be champions, especially knowing how difficult such a feat is to achieve. There is no way you can prepare for penalties in training \u2013 the pressure and tiredness isn't the same \u2013 but we had the experience and the players were brilliant, especially Palop.\"\n\nErnesto Valverde, Espanyol coach: \"It was a cruel ending for us again, but we can go home with our heads high. We have ended the competition without losing a game and we've won 11 of the 15 we have played. I think the players were fantastic. If they had to lose I would prefer it to be like this.\"\n\n2014 final penalty shoot-out highlights: Sevilla v Benfica\n\nThere was more penalty glory for Sevilla seven years later as they secured a record-equalling third title and their first since the Europa League rebranding.\n\nIn an end-to-end match, there was nothing to choose between the two sides in front of a colourful and vibrant atmosphere in Italy.\n\nIn the end, goalkeeper Beto took inspiration from Palop and saved penalties from Benfica pair \u00d3scar Cardozo and Rodrigo to add another chapter to Sevilla's remarkable European story.\n\nStarting line-ups\n\nSevilla: Beto; Coke, Pareja, Fazio, Moreno; Mbia, Rakiti\u0107, Daniel Carri\u00e7o; Reyes, Bacca, Vitolo\n\nBenfica: Oblak; Maxi Pereira, Luis\u00e3o, Garay, Siqueira; R\u00faben Amorim, Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Gait\u00e1n; Sulejmani, Lima, Rodrigo\n\nWhat they said\n\nUnai Emery, Sevilla coach: \"Benfica deserved to be in the final and so did we. At times the game was totally even, but by the end they were doing most of the pushing. You could tell our players were suffering from fatigue and physical discomfort but this team has learned how to suffer. We have learned how to stay strong and so we were ready for that.\"\n\nJorge Jesus, Benfica coach: \"Today, in the game, the best team did not win the Europa League. The Benfica players should be congratulated. There is nothing I can criticise. We leave the game with our heads held high.\"\n\n2014/15 Europa League final, Warsaw: Dnipro 2-3 Sevilla\n\n2015 final highlights: Dnipro 2-3 Sevilla\n\nThere was no need for a shoot-out on this occasion as Emery's team won in normal time in one of the most entertaining Europa League finals in memory.\n\nIn a breathless first half, Ukrainian underdogs Dnipro took a surprise lead after just seven minutes through Nikola Kalini\u0107, before Sevilla's Grzegorz Krychowiak and Carlos Bacca scored quickfire goals to turn the match on its head.\n\nRuslan Rotan equalised before half-time, but Bacca would have the decisive say as his cool left-footed finish in the 73rd minute saw Sevilla secure back-to-back titles for the second time.\n\nStarting line-ups\n\nDnipro: Boyko; Fedetskiy, Douglas, Cheberyachko, L\u00e9o Matos; Matheus, Kankava, Rotan, Fedorchuk, Konoplyanka; Kalini\u0107\n\nSevilla: Rico; Aleix Vidal, Daniel Carri\u00e7o, Kolodziejczak, Tr\u00e9moulinas; Mbia, Krychowiak; Reyes, Banega, Vitolo; Bacca\n\nWhat they said\n\nUnai Emery, Sevilla coach: \"Reaching the final was the most important thing and once we did we had to enjoy it. I'm very happy here. We wanted this competition a lot, all of Sevilla did. There have been a lot of finals, this the latest, against a very physical, strong team. The joy makes the work worthwhile.\"\n\nMyron Markevych, Dnipro coach: \"We had worked a lot, we knew Bacca would play as a very aggressive attacker. Unfortunately today we let him do that. If an attacker scores two goals, perhaps you can say the defender did not cope. But today you have to praise the attacker \u2013 he played very well.\"\n\n2015/16 Europa League final, Basel: Liverpool 1-3 Sevilla\n\n2016 final highlights: Liverpool 1-3 Sevilla\n\nAn incredible third Europa League title in a row awaited Sevilla in Switzerland as they upset the odds to beat heavily fancied Liverpool.\n\nDaniel Sturridge gave J\u00fcrgen Klopp's side the lead in the first period but Kevin Gameiro equalised just moments after the second half kicked off, tapping home from Mariano Ferreira's terrific cross.\n\nFrom there it was Sevilla icon Coke who took control, the midfielder first scoring a curling effort from just outside the box before adding a second from close range to secure a fifth title for the club and a third for coach Emery.\n\nStarting line-ups\n\nLiverpool: Mignolet; Clyne, Lovren, Tour\u00e9, Moreno; Milner, Emre Can; Lallana, Firmino, Coutinho; Sturridge\n\nSevilla: Soria; Mariano Ferreira, Rami, Daniel Carri\u00e7o, Escudero; Krychowiak, Nzonzi; Coke, Banega, Vitolo; Gameiro\n\nWhat they said\n\nUnai Emery, Sevilla coach: \"This final could have been the most difficult one. In the second half we made Liverpool smaller, we played with a lot of confidence. We knew that we could not lose that opportunity. We felt a personal satisfaction and for everyone else, seeing that the competition has grown a lot. By winning it three times in a row, we have helped it.\"\n\nJurgen Klopp, Liverpool coach: \"We had a few moments where we performed well, but to have this consistency you need a bit more time. They are still young, it is the players' first big final. We will use this experience together and then some day everyone will say Basel was a very decisive moment in the future of Liverpool.\"\n\n2019/20 Europa League final, Cologne: Sevilla 3-2 Inter\n\n2020 final highlights: Sevilla 3-2 Inter\n\nAfter a four-year wait, Sevilla claimed title No6 in the pandemic-interrupted 2019/20 season, edging a five-goal thriller against Inter in Germany.\n\nThey once again had to come from behind, Romelu Lukaku giving Inter the lead with a penalty after five minutes. Two Luuk de Jong goals turned the game on its head, but Diego God\u00edn replied for the Nerazzurri as the teams went into half-time level.\n\nAs they have done so often, though, Sevilla showed incredible spirit and mental strength to eventually come out on top, with the unfortunate Lukaku deflecting an acrobatic Diego Carlos effort into his own net as the Liga outfit were crowned champions once more.\n\nStarting line-ups\n\nSevilla: Bounou; Jes\u00fas Navas, Kound\u00e9, Diego Carlos, Reguil\u00f3n; Jord\u00e1n, Fernando, Banega; Ocampos, De Jong, Suso\n\nInter: Handanovi\u0107; God\u00edn, De Vrij, Bastoni; D'Ambrosio, Barella, Brozovi\u0107, Gagliardini, Young; Lukaku, Mart\u00ednez\n\nWhat they said\n\nJulen Lopetegui, Sevilla coach: \"You have to know how to cope with difficult moments and overcome them. This is a feeling of immense happiness. I'm so grateful to our players for how hard they worked. Our anthem says we never give up and tonight we proved that again.\"\n\nAntonio Conte, Inter coach: \"It was a tough, well-balanced game where, in the second half, one incident could change it. We had the opportunity, but instead there was that unlucky deflection off Romelu, so inevitably it became very difficult after that.\"\n\nHighlights: Sevilla 1-1 Roma (4-1 pens)\n\nFor the fourth successive final, Sevilla did it the hard way, coming from behind. Second best for much of the first half in Budapest, the Spanish side went into the break trailing to Paulo Dybala's well-taken goal.\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Mendilibar, in only his seventh European game as a coach at 62, acted decisively, bringing on Suso and Erik Lamela. The tide turned immediately and Sevilla were soon level when Gianluca Mancini diverted Jes\u00fas Navas's cross into his own net.\n\nNeither side could find a winner as the game moved into extra time and ultimately penalties. There, Yassine Bounou was the hero as he denied Mancini and Roger Iba\u00f1ez. Gonzalo Montiel, who scored the decisive penalty for Argentina in the 2022 World Cup final, had the last word here too.\n\nStarting line-ups\n\nSevilla: Bounou; Jes\u00fas Navas, Bad\u00e9, Gudelj, Alex Telles; Fernando, Rakiti\u0107; Ocampos, \u00d3liver Torres, Bryan Gil; En-Nesyri\n\nRoma: Rui Patr\u00edcio; Iba\u00f1ez, Mancini, Smalling; Zeki \u00c7elik, Cristante, Mati\u0107, Spinazzola; Pellegrini, Dybala; Abraham\n\nWhat they said\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis Mendilibar, Sevilla coach: \"When they scored, you think that it would be very difficult to score against them. The equaliser came quickly in the second half and gave us the strength to continue in the fight to win the game.\"\n\nYassine Bounou, Sevilla goalkeeper: \"I've had a lot of moments like this and I realised that you have to be very calm to deal with them. My team-mates also give me a lot of calm and security. This year has been full of emotions, between the World Cup [Morocco reached the semi-finals] and today.\"\n\nDownload the Europa app"}, {"url": "https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/0251-0e987dba2198-4ca0099d9ed1-1000--knockout-stats-and-records/", "page_content": "Europa League records: Players\n\nMost appearances in the Europa League knockouts\n\nFour-time Europa League winner Kevin Gameiro and four-time finalist Eduardo Salvio share the record for most appearances in the knockout stages.\n\nFrenchman Gameiro made 39 appearances across five season between 2013/14 and 2018/19, lifting the trophy four times with Sevilla and Atl\u00e9tico before reaching the semis with Valencia.\n\nSalvio's 39 games took place from 2009/10 and 2018/19, the Argentina winger winning the title twice with Atleti and twice finishing runners-up with Benfica.

But it was a great moment and winning the trophy for a club like Sevilla was exceptional. The fans were right behind us. You feel the passion around the club. Scoring the decisive penalty and winning the cup was fantastic.\n\nUEFA.com: Do you accept that Sevilla are favourites in this season's final?\n\nGameiro: We are the favourites to win this competition because we won it last year. But we mustn't dwell on that \u2013 we know that Dnipro are a very good team and they aren't there by chance. It's up to us to put in a top performance and give it our all like we've done in previous rounds.\n\nUEFA.com: You came off the bench to score against FC Zenit in the quarter-finals. Can you talk us through it?\n\nGameiro with the trophy in 2014 \u00a9Getty Images\n\nGameiro: It was a very tough match. We were losing 2-1 and if we hadn't scored that goal, we'd have gone into extra time \u2013 or they could have scored again. I remember the boss saying to me when I went on that I'd get a chance and that I had to be ready to score. That's what I managed to do. That's why you play football \u2013 for moments like that, when you can get your team through to the next round. When you're a footballer, you want to play every minute of every match, so when he calls on you, you have to be ready and that's what I try to do whenever I'm a substitute. The team is the most important thing and it's about winning. If I can help by scoring, it's always a pleasure.\n\nUEFA.com: What do you think when you receive the ball in a shooting position?\n\nGameiro: I don't stop to think \u2013 when I do, that's when I miss! Being a striker is all about working in front of goal and always maintaining the hope that you're going to score in every match. It's not easy, but even if you miss a chance, you cannot dwell on it. You know you're going to get another one, and if you get one, you have to show you're on the ball and be able to put it away.\n\nGameiro: My dream five-a-side\n\nUEFA.com: Who was your hero as a kid?\n\nGameiro: Like everyone, Ronaldo. Apart from that, I always admired Jean-Pierre Papin. He was another really great goalscorer, he was French and I really liked him because his style was similar to mine \u2013 he didn't overanalyse things, he'd get the ball and go for goal.\n\nUEFA.com: This season's UEFA Europa League winners get to play in next season's UEFA Champions League. Is that an extra motivation for the players?\n\nGameiro: Yes. It's a shame the rule didn't apply last year.

They were in front inside ten minutes, Gameiro catching Maksym Malyshev in possession and haring through to send a low shot across Andriy Pyatov and into the net. Shakhtar initially offered little in response, but exploded into life with half-time approaching, Marlos playing a stylish ball inside the last man for Eduardo to nudge past the exposed David Soria.\n\nA rapid Marlos dart upfield had Sevilla scrambling again before the break, and Mircea Lucescu's side looked lively afterwards too, Viktor Kovalenko's rising shot demanding intervention from Soria. However, the wind was swiftly taken from their sails; Grzegorz Krychowiak picked out the ever-ready Gameiro as he raced into the box, and the Frenchman took the ball past Pyatov with one touch before finding the goal from a rapidly narrowing angle.\n\nGameiro celebrates Sevilla's first \u00a9AFP/Getty Images\n\nGameiro almost completed his hat-trick with an acrobatic kick, but it was Mariano Ferreira who killed the tie off, the right-back bending a powerful shot past Pyatov from outside the box.

The Israeli center-forward has also scored 24 goals in the competition and took 52 games to do so. He has played eight seasons in the UEL, the most among the ten top most goalscorers too.\n\n2. Aritz Aduriz \u2013 28 goals\n\nAritz Aduriz has only played for Athletic Bilbao in the UEL. However, his goalscoring record for them in the competition is impressive. He scored 28 goals for the Basque club in 40 appearances spread across six seasons and two different spells before retiring in 2020. Aduriz was the top-scorer in the 2015-16 season with 10 goals.\n\n1. Radamel Falcao \u2013 30 goals\n\nFalcao won the top scorer award in the UEL twice\n\nRadamel Falcao is occupying the top spot among the highest scorers in the history of the UEFA Europa League. The Colombian has scored 30 goals in merely 31 appearances in the competition, having one of the best goals per game record. Falcao has won the top-scorer award twice since the beginning of the UEL, once with FC Porto and the second time with Atletico Madrid.\n\nNote: the stats are accurate as of 31 March 2021.\n\nFor more updates, follow Khel Now on Twitter, Instagram and join our community on Telegram."}, {"url": "https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/025a-0ea7b98f938d-91146fce76ee-1000--sevilla-s-gameiro-geared-up-for-benfica-showdown/", "page_content": "Top scorer for Sevilla FC en route to the UEFA Europa League final, Kevin Gameiro is relishing the chance to fire his side to glory against SL Benfica next Wednesday. The France forward has struck five times in the competition since joining from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, and he vowed that he and his team-mates \"will not be going to Turin just to watch Benfica play\".\n\nSpeaking to UEFA.com, the 27-year-old also reflected on his first term in Spain, Sevilla coach Unai Emery and the intense emotions produced when St\u00e9phane Mbia's added-time goal sent the Andalusian club past Valencia CF in the last four.\n\nUEFA.com: How has your campaign been so far?\n\nKevin Gameiro: It's been a great season in the Europa League, which hasn't been easy at all. We had a difficult tie against Betis [in the round of 16] but managed to do well in the return leg in order to qualify. It was the same against Porto [in the quarter-finals]: we lost the first leg and won the second. We then had a very tough game at Valencia and St\u00e9phane Mbia scored in the last minute. You could say it was a stroke of luck, of fate, that got us to the final.\n\nUEFA.com: How have you adapted since joining Sevilla last summer?\n\nGameiro: It's been a very good season, I've scored 21 goals. It wasn't an easy season though. When I arrived, I needed to adapt to Spanish culture and football. I tried to adapt quite quickly, even though I suffered some injuries halfway through. Right now I feel physically fit, I feel good and I'm helping the team score goals.\n\nUEFA.com: Have you changed your style of play since joining?\n\nGameiro: No, I haven't adapted my game to the Spanish league, because I think I possess the characteristics to play in this league and that's why I chose it rather than another. I am a small and fast player, quick \u2013 very quick, even. I am comfortable with the ball and that's allowed me to develop very well here.\n\nUEFA.com: What is your role in the team?\n\nGameiro: The most important thing for a striker is to score goals, whether it's from one metre, one centimetre, ten metres or 20 \u2013 a goal is a goal. I don't care if I score from a scissor kick or with my knee. As for my most important task, it's what the coach tells us before every game: for us strikers, the most important thing for us and the team is for our goalkeeper not to concede. The first line of defence is the forwards, and that's what's made the difference this season for Sevilla.\n\nUEFA.com: Sevilla very nearly missed out on a place in the final, of course.\n\nGameiro: Yes, the return leg against Valencia was a very difficult game. I think we were a bit lost in the first half, and we were dominated during that game. That wasn't easy. The players on the bench wanted to step in and help the team score that one goal. Then, like the coach said in his team talk, we were two goals up and the most important thing was to score one more. That goal came at the very end, and it is great to experience moments like those. It's cruel for your opponents, but when you experience a moment like that, when you end up as winners, it's wonderful.\n\nUEFA.com: How did you feel when St\u00e9phane Mbia scored in added time?\n\nGameiro: When St\u00e9phane scored, there was a feeling of joy, of happiness, because we knew it was over \u2013 it was ten or 20 seconds before the end. It was wonderful. Those are moments you will experience maybe once in your career and you have to enjoy them fully.\n\nUEFA.com: Can you tell us a little about your coach Unai Emery?\n\nGameiro: He's someone who is very passionate. He lives for football, he experiences the games like a fan \u2013 he's even more than passionate. For me, it's the first time I've seen a coach who lives the games so fully. He's totally committed to it, even during the week; it's not only during the game. In training, he's fully into it, and that's what gives us that determination to overcome things when we're behind, or when we have to score important goals.\n\nUEFA.com: Do you think Sevilla will be outsiders in the final?\n\nGameiro: Yes. We know it's a great season for Benfica as well. They've had a great campaign, they've won their league, and they knocked Juventus out which was not an easy task, especially in Turin. But it's a one-off game and anything is possible. The most important thing is to give everything and not regret anything at the end \u2013 to give everything, to be 100% fit and then see what happens.\n\nUEFA.com: How will you approach the final?\n\nGameiro: Let's just say we'll give everything from the first minute to the last. As I said, we will enjoy the moment and try to win the final, because we will not be going to Turin just to watch Benfica play. The most important thing is to give everything and win this trophy. We know that it's very important for our club: they've won it twice before and we will try to win the third one.\n\nUEFA.com: What do you expect from Benfica?\n\nGameiro: That they will give everything, just like us. They won't give up. Last year they reached the final and lost. It will be revenge for them to try and win. We'll see how it goes and won't think too much about it. We will work together with the team and the coach this week and look at how they play and analyse their game.\n\nUEFA.com: What else are you expecting from the final?\n\nGameiro: I expect a great atmosphere in a stadium that I don't know yet. It will be my first final as a player and it will be exceptional. But we shouldn't think about it too much \u2013 we must prepare well and not put too much pressure on ourselves. We will give 100% and try to get the win, and hope to be able to lift the trophy at the end."}], "K\u00e9vin Gameiro joined Sevilla in 2014.": [{"url": "https://fbref.com/en/players/42276181/Kevin-Gameiro", "page_content": "About FBref.com\n\nFBref.com launched (June 13, 2018) with domestic league coverage for England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United States.

The striker, who will sign for four seasons, will travel to Madrid this evening. The transfer is contingent to the French player successfully undergoing the medical examination.\n\nGameiro (Senlis, France, 9th May, 1987) made his debut with Racing Strasbourg in the French Ligue 1 in 2005. In 2008, he signed with FC Lorient with which he would score 56 goals in three seasons, an effectiveness that would catch the attention of PSG and make him debut with the French senior national team. After two seasons in the Parisian club, with which he scored 23 goals, he came to Sevilla.\n\nIn the Sevillian squad, Gameiro was key in the winning of three Europa Leagues. In total, the French international scored 67 goals and gave 17 assists in three seasons to become one of the more destabilising strikers of LaLiga.\n\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Luis P\u00e9rez Caminero analysed the signing of Gameiro from Australia. For Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Sporting Director, this is \"great news, since he is a reinforcement that will allow us to increase the competitiveness in the offensive part of the group. He is a very fast player, a great finisher and has been competing for several years in the Spanish League, so his adaptation will be easier. He is a forward used to pressuring the rival\u2019s attack and tireless in his effort, so he fits perfectly into what we wanted to strengthen our attack.\"\n\nThe club wishes him the best in this new professional stage as an Atl\u00e9tico. #WelcomeGameiro!"}, {"url": "https://sofifa.com/player/176600/kevin-gameiro/160058/", "page_content": "All product names, logos, and brands are the property of their respective owners.\n\nAll company, product, and service names used in this website are for identification purposes only.\n\nTerms Privacy FAQ"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/23/europa-league-quarter-final-roundup-sevilla-zenit-st-petersburg", "page_content": "Sevilla\u2019s K\u00e9vin Gameiro scored a late equaliser to snatch a 2-2 draw at Zenit St Petersburg that sent the Europa League holders into the semi-finals with a 4-3 aggregate win on Thursday.\n\nFiorentina also went through by beating 10-man Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 for a 3-1 aggregate win while Napoli completed a 6-3 win over two legs against Wolfsburg after a 2-2 draw in Italy.\n\nUefa\u2019s fears of a final between teams from Russia and Ukraine were avoided as Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk became the only team from those two countries to reach the last four by beating Club Brugge 1-0 after the first leg had ended goalless.\n\nSevilla\u2019s clash with Zenit was in the balance heading into the second leg with the Spaniards holding a 2-1 lead which they increased after six minutes with Carlos Bacca\u2019s penalty.\n\nThe Russians, who were the only side left who had dropped into the competition in the last 32 from the Champions League, fought back with second-half goals from Jos\u00e9 Rond\u00f3n and Hulk.\n\nThe visitors, however, wrapped up the tie when Gameiro rifled into the corner with five minutes remaining.\n\nNapoli\u2019s clash with Wolfsburg had the feel of a dead rubber in a tame first half and any hope of a German comeback was effectively extinguished by goals at the start of the second half from Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n and Dries Mertens.\n\nThe visitors salvaged some pride, however, with goals from Timm Klose and Ivan Perisic.\n\nDynamo Kyiv\u2019s hopes of upsetting Fiorentina were hit when Jeremain Lens received a dubious second booking for diving and was dismissed in the 40th minute.\n\nFiorentina took the lead three minutes later with a goal from Mario Gomez before the substitute Juan Manuel Vargas made it 2-0 deep into stoppage time.\n\nDnipro reached the semi-finals when Yevhen Shakhov\u2019s deflected effort found the back of the net after 82 minutes."}]}
