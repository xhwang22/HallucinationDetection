The Baltimore Sun reported that 6,065 fans attended, a huge number for that era, and the reported number may actually have been larger since throngs of fence climbers made their way over the 12-foot barrier into the park before and during the game. Attendees had picnics on the grass while the game was played, kids frolicked in the nearby fields, and many of the fans may not have noticed when manager Billy Barnie was arrested after the final out.\n\nBilly Barnie, manager of the Baltimore Orioles from 1883 to 1891.\n\nThe New York-born Barnie began his career as a catcher and outfielder for the National Association in 1870s, but wasn\u2019t an everyday player. He started his career playing for the Hartford (Conn.) Dark Blues in 1874, and drifted around the northeast playing for the Keokuck (N.Y.) Westerns and the New York Mutuals through 1875. A journeyman by 24, he bounced around to Columbus, Buffalo and San Francisco trying to find playing time. By 1881 he was playing for the Brooklyn (N.Y.) Atlantics on the Eastern Championship Association, and in 1883 he re-emerged as a manager for the American Association Baltimore Orioles. He even took the field as a catcher in 19 games in 1883 and 1886. He found more success as a manager than a player, but in his eight years in Baltimore never finished above third place. Despite his lack of success he became a local celebrity and was well known in Baltimore.\n\nFans Wanted Sunday Baseball\n\nIn recounting the events of that day, the Sun said that after the umpire ended the game, \u201cBald Billy\u201d Barnie was approached by Anne Arundel County Sheriff James S. Armiger and Deputy James T. Small, who produced a warrant and who placed him under arrest. It was the first time Barnie was ever arrested, he told reporters. He was taken to Justice Thomas Green\u2019s office in Brooklyn and was booked and kept overnight. Justice Green set a $300 bail, and at 10 a.m. the next morning, Acton\u2019s Park owner Samuel G. Acton showed up and bailed the manager out. For his part in the affair, Barnie was fined $5.\n\nTechnically, Barnie was truly responsible for fielding the team that broke the law. He violated Section 247, Article 27 of the State\u2019s Code of Public General Laws by unlawfully playing, or causing to be played, baseball on the Sabbath Day. Yes, there was actually a law on the books prohibiting baseball on Sundays in Maryland. The Old Line State wasn\u2019t alone in that regard; many other states had similar laws. The Orioles charged admission and players were paid, thus making it illegal. Sheriff Armiger sounded almost apologetic in explaining that he was advised by State\u2019s Attorney James Munroe that he must enforce the law against any illegal act.\n\nSome in the press speculated that the Acton\u2019s Park game was meant to test the Sabbath laws, which were beginning to seem antiquated. On that same Sunday the Orioles played in Brooklyn, the Washington Nationals played Wilmington in D.C., but no one was arrested there.\n\nBut why play in Brooklyn? It might have been because the two years the Orioles spent at Oriole Park II were tumultuous, and its location in Waverly in north central Baltimore at Greenmount Avenue and East 29th Street was not well appreciated by fans. Alternatively, it might have been because as a test of the Sabbath laws, the team might have found a more sympathetic host in Anne Arundel County than in Baltimore County. Furthermore, the Long Bridge made Acton\u2019s Park a favorite location among many of Baltimore\u2019s elite. Orioles officials even told the Sun that they were considering making it their new home field. But the team turmoil continued, and Oriole Park III, also known as Union Park, was created in Baltimore at Guilford and 25th Streets.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sabbath laws were slowly being repealed throughout the country, especially in the post-World War I years. Returning servicemen and their families were looking for more types of Sunday recreation. Even with the Acton\u2019s Park \u201ctest\u201d in June 1890, Maryland didn\u2019t completely resolve the Sunday baseball issue until nearly 30 years later when Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals overturned Sabbath Blue Laws in 1919. Acton\u2019s Park barely lasted that long. Its longtime owner, Samuel G. Acton, died in 1903, and by 1919 Baltimore had annexed Brooklyn and was selling the property for industrial uses. By then the Orioles had moved on to a new Baltimore location, Oriole Park V, also known as Terrapins Park, at Greenmount and 29th Streets.\n\nA Seminal, Sloppy Sunday Game\n\nSo what happened on the field that day in 1890? The Orioles held off the Hartfords 11\u20138 in a sloppy game that the Sun called \u201cinteresting.\u201d Catcher George Townsend was the hero, going three-for-three and driving in three runs. Norm Baker was the Orioles winning pitcher. But the Orioles certainly won ugly. Combined, both Baker and Hartford pitcher, James Lyston (a Baltimore native), gave up only six earned runs. But Baker walked four and Lyston handed out seven free passes. The Orioles logged six errors on a dry field worn down by local teams; Hartford had three errors of their own. The Orioles ran rampant on Hartford catcher, Alfred Moore, stealing eight bases that day. The crowd was large and boisterous, but the Orioles didn\u2019t play great baseball. And then skipper Billy Barnie went to jail."}, {"url": "https://dcbaseballhistory.com/2012/11/billy-barnie/", "page_content": "Billy Barnie\n\nWith Davey Johnson\u2019s selection as Manager of the Year this a good time to reflect back on the District\u2019s first National League manager. Like Johnson he had strong roots in Baltimore.\n\nWith Born in New York, three years after the half century mark, Billy or \u201cBald Billy\u201d as he was called is usually associated with Baltimore where he was a fixture for many years. Although small in stature he played behind the bat and when physical ailments curtailed his playing career, Billy made the shifted over full time to the bench. It was here that is talents as a manager and organizer came to the forefront.\n\nIn 1885, Barnie was in his third year as manager of the Association Baltimore nine. Barnie\u2019s Orioles finished a dismal 8th with a record of 41-68. Earlier in the season he had declined an invitation from Michael Scanlon, manager of the Eastern League Washington Nationals. The refusal caused a dustup in the papers in Baltimore and the District with the charge that Barnie was afraid to play the Nationals. Certainly there was bad blood between Barnie and Scanlon since, it was alleged, Barnie had cast the deciding vote to keep Washington out of the Association. At the end of the season the two teams did meet and that series will be discussed at a later date.\n\nWith the collapse of the American Association after the 1891 season, Barnie was out of a job. The Philadelphia Press said this about Barnie in 1891, \u201cPoor Billy Barnie. He is to the ball writers what the tariff is to the economists. It is doubtful if anybody is dammed with more than the bald-headed band master of the Baltimore Bucks and it is doubtful if anybody deserves it less.\u201d\n\nTo the surprise of some Billy Barnie is signed to be the manager for the Washington Nationals, the first National League Club in the District\u2019s history. Barnie is a fan favorite in Washington and dubbed, \u201cThe Hustler from Hustlerville.\u201d One fan states, \u201cWe\u2019ll have a team now which will knock the stuffin\u2019 out of Baltimore.\u201d The fans also hope the Wagner\u2019s will bring some of the talent from Philadelphia, where they had owned the Association Club with them.\n\nJ Earl Wagner gets married in January and announces he will retire from baseball and will run the families meat packing business in Philadelphia. George Wagner will assume control over baseball operations in Washington. George it will later be written, only comes to the District to cause trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals head south for spring training, a rarity during the Wagner years. During their time south the Wagner brothers circulate rumors that Manager Billy Barnie will be fired and replaced by Arthur Irwin.\n\nOn 16 April, after a 6 to 5 loss at home to the New York Giants. Billy Barnie is fired for talking back to George Wagner. George had asked Barnie to resign and he said, no! With Billy Barnie gone the Wagner brothers sign Arthur Irwin. The firing of Billy Barnie is met with a large howl from the fans who like Barnie and dislike Irwin.\n\nSporting Life adds the following, \u201cHe started the spring of 1892 as manager of the Washington team, but could not get along with the Wagner brothers, and soon resigned and finished the season partly as league umpire and partly as manager of the Ft. Wayne team. In 1893-94 he managed the Louisville Club with success. In the fall of 1894 he took part in the memorable attempt to reorganize the American Association, and was foolishly blacklisted by the League, only to be soon reinstated, however. In 1895 Barnie managed the Scranton team of the Eastern League. In 1897 he was manager of the Brooklyn team. In 1898 he organized the Hartford Club for the Eastern League, of which club Barnie remained the part owner and manager up to the day of his death.\u201d\n\nBarnie died in 1900, at the age of 47. It was a tragic loss for a well respected player and manager. The Sporting Life had this to say about Billy Barnie,\u201dStrictly Honorable in all of his dealings with his fellow-men. There was a standing remark that, like the lamented Harry Wright, Barnie was too good for professional base ball and too honest for his own good. Considering the caliber of many of the unscrupulous men who have fastened and fattened on base ball to the exclusion of more loyal, more liberal and more honest man this was in a measure true. But there was compensation better than dollars and cents in the universal respect which Barnie, like Harry Wright, enjoyed in the base ball world. Barnie was \u201calways a staunch and loyal American Association man and a consistent hater of the \u201cdiplomatic,\u201d unscrupulous and tyrannical old League. He was active in every move to re-establish the Association and had he lived he would have been a big factor in the new Association, which will, no doubt, take the field next spring. What a pity that poor Billy could, not live just long enough to see the fruition of his ardent hopes and labors!\n\nHis early death would have implications for baseball in Washington. In 1901 the National League was under assault by one but two leagues. If Barnie had lived he would have been a key factor in putting an Association team in Baltimore, maybe even getting John McGraw to join him. If so it might have helped Thomas C. Noyes in Washington who did not have the support of Ban Johnson. But that is a story for another day."}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/billy.barnie/1752102", "page_content": "Billy Barnie\n\nbaseball player\n\nJanuary 26, 1853 (age 47) New York City\n\nBorn in New York City, he played as a right fielder in the National Association in 1874-1875.

Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Billy_Barnie", "page_content": "William Harrison Barnie\n\n(Baid Billy)\n\nBats Unknown, Throws Unknown\n\nUnknown, Unknown Height 5' 7\", Weight 157 lb.\n\nBR page\n\nBiographical Information [ edit ]\n\n\"There was a standing remark that, like the lamented Harry Wright, Barnie was too good for professional base ball and too honest for his own good. . .

His playing seasons were in 1874-1875, 1883, and 1886. During his playing days, his appearances were split about equally between catcher and outfield. As a catcher, he made 76 errors in 53 games, while as an outfielder he made 23 errors in 46 games. His batting average was .171. He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://wikimili.com/en/List_of_Baltimore_Orioles_(1882%E2%80%931899)_managers", "page_content": "The Baltimore Orioles were a 19th-century Major League Baseball team that played in Baltimore, Maryland.

He began managing in 1882 and spent 9 years with the Baltimore Orioles in the American Association. He then managed three teams in the National League. None of his teams finished higher than 3rd. When he wasn't managing in the AA or the NL, Barnie managed the Scranton Coal Heavers in the Eastern League in 1895, the Hartford Bluebirds in the Atlantic League in 1896, and the Hartford Indians in the EL from 1899 until mid-1900. He also was an umpire in the National League and American Association between 1882 and 1892.\n\nSporting Life of July 21, 1900 carried his lengthy obituary, calling him \"one of the best known base ball men in the country\". It stated that he started in amateur ball at a very young age in 1865. He was primarily a catcher during his playing career, but when he became \"crippled in one hand\" he started to manage. In addition to a long career as a manager, he was also the organizer and part owner of the Hartford club. He was given credit for discovering a number of famous major leaguers, including King Kelly. He served on the rules and scheduling committees of the American Association and is responsible for at least one rule change that endures to this day, the creation of the Coaches box, down the two base lines. He made the suggestion to confine coaches to such a box after a number of team had taken to the habit of having their third base coach interfere in the play by running down with a baserunner in order to draw a throw, and do various other unsporting gestures; Arlie Latham of the St. Louis Browns was a particularly enthusiastic offender. The rule was adopted at his suggestion in the middle of the 1886 season.\n\n\n\n\n\nYear-by-Year Managerial Record [ edit ]\n\nFurther Reading [ edit ]\n\nMarty Payne: \"Beer Tanks and Barbed Wire: Bill Barnie and Baltimore\", in The Baseball Research Journal, SABR, Volume 42, Number 1 (Spring 2013), pp. 25-29."}, {"url": "https://sabr.org/journal/article/baltimores-forgotten-dynasty-the-1919-25-baltimore-orioles-of-the-international-league/", "page_content": "This article was written by Alan Cohen\n\nThis article was published in The National Pastime: A Bird\u2019s-Eye View of Baltimore (2020)\n\n1920 Baltimore Orioles, International League champions. (BALTIMORE SUN)\n\nIn 1920, the Baltimore Orioles were champions of the International League (IL) for the second straight year. Baltimore would win seven consecutive pennants (1919\u201325), and six of the championship teams are ranked in the top 20 of the 100 best minor league teams of the twentieth century by Bill Weiss and Marshall Wright.1 (See sidebar 1 below.)\n\nOwner Jack Dunn had survived the invasion of the Federal League by selling off some of his players and hightailing it to Richmond, VA, then returning to Baltimore in 1916. He would create a minor-league dynasty, locking up his best players for years during a time when the IL was exempt from the major league draft. The man who had sold Babe Ruth to the Red Sox for a bargain price had learned his lesson, placing high price tags on players desired by big-league clubs. Dunn and 11 of his players are in the International League Hall of Fame. Only one player from the dynasty years made it to Cooperstown, and there should have been more. (See sidebar 2). This article will discuss these eleven players and the championship seasons of which they were a part.\n\nJack Bentley joined the Washington Nationals (nicknamed the Senators) at the end of 1913 and, in parts of four seasons, compiled a 6\u20139 record in 39 games as a pitcher. He was dispatched to Minneapolis of the American Association and, on August 18, 1916, was sent to Baltimore for the balance of the season. He was formally traded by Washington to Baltimore in early 1917 and was the cornerstone as Dunn rebuilt the Orioles.\n\nObtained by Dunn along with Bentley was Turner Barber, who was dealt to the Cubs in exchange for outfielder Merwin Jacobson, who starred with Baltimore from 1919 through 1924. Although his services had been secured prior to the 1918 season, Jacobson spent that year in Washington, DC, doing war-related work.\n\nBentley also came into his own as a hitter in 1916, and in 1917, batting .343. Suffering from arm trouble, he only appeared in one game as a pitcher. Baltimore improved to 88-61, finishing in third place, 2.5 games behind the league leaders.\n\nBaltimore almost lost Bentley after the 1917 season. He was drafted by the Red Sox but entered the Army, serving with distinction in World War I. As 1919 began, he was still in France, and the Red Sox still had the rights to his services. Boston didn\u2019t need Bentley at first base, as they had Stuffy McInnis. As Boston owner Harry Frazee hadn\u2019t paid the $2,500 draft price for Bentley by February 1, Bentley returned to Baltimore.\n\nIn the abbreviated 1918 season, Baltimore continued to build. Otis Lawry, who had been obtained from the Athletics in a seven-player deal after the 1917 season, came into his own, batting .317. He played with the Orioles until midway through the 1924 season.\n\nEighteen-year-old Max Bishop was installed at third base in 1918. With Bentley still in Europe at the start of the 1919 season, Bishop played first base. His average through the season\u2019s first eight games stood at .652 with seven extra-base hits.. Once Bentley returned, Bishop was moved to second base, and it was at that position that he would remain for the balance of his professional career.\n\nNew faces were on the left side of the infield in 1919. The shortstop was Joe Boley, who played in the low minors in 1916 and 1917 and did not play in organized baseball in 1918. He had taken a job at a plant with work related to the war effort in 1917, and he played on the plant\u2019s semi-pro team in 1917 and 1918. One of his teammates in 1917 had been Bishop. Bishop suggested that Dunn sign Boley and the shortstop joined the Orioles in 1919.2\n\nFritz Maisel was popular with Baltimore when he played with them from 1911 through mid-1913. He was traded to the Yankees and was with them through 1917. He spent 1918 with the St. Louis Browns. His acquisition by Dunn as the team\u2019s third baseman put another stone in place.3\n\nBaltimore opened at home against Rochester on April 30, 1919, with Rube Parnham pitching. The 25-year-old had gone 38-19 with Baltimore over the prior two seasons, but until January 16, 1918, was property of the Philadelphia Athletics. He had appeared briefly, in a total of six games, with Philadelphia in 1916 and 1917. Parnham was Baltimore\u2019s top pitcher in 1919, going 28-12.\n\nBentley returned to Baltimore on June 21, 1919. On his first day in the lineup, he started the second game of a doubleheader against Rochester and went 3-for-5 with a sixth-inning homer.4\n\nBaltimore won the IL pennant by eight games. After the season, Baltimore did not participate in the Junior World Series, which was contested that year between the champions of the American Association and the Pacific Coast League.\n\nLate in 1919, Dunn ensured the future success of the team by signing his stars to two-year contracts. He demanded top money for his players, including a man who came on board during the 1920 season: Robert Moses \u201cLefty\u201d Grove. Only 20 years old, Grove got his professional start in 1920 with Martinsburg, West Virginia in the Class D Blue Ridge League. His 1.68 ERA and 60 strikeouts in 59 innings aroused the interest of Dunn, who secured Grove\u2019s services.\n\nGrove joined Baltimore in late June and won his first two outings. In his first appearance, on July 1, he defeated Jersey City 9-3 in the second game of a doubleheader giving the Orioles a one and a half game lead in the league standings. He allowed five hits in the abbreviated seven-inning contest. Three days later, he defeated Reading, 8-1. He scattered seven hits, struck out eight, and, in the fourth inning, struck out the side.5\n\nAnother new arm in 1920 was that of Jack Ogden. Ogden was obtained from Rochester, where he had gone 10-13 in 1919. With Baltimore, he shined, and Dunn held on to him through 1927. In six of eight seasons, he won more than 20 games, and his record for the eight seasons was 191-80.\n\nThe 1920 Orioles still had Bentley, and he returned to mound duty, going 16-3 with a league leading 2.10 ERA. He also swung a potent bat with 71 extra-base hits, 20 of which were homers, to go along with a .371 batting average. His 161 RBIs led the league.\n\nBaltimore won its last 25 games to set an IL record. Their season\u2019s record of 110-43 barely eclipsed Toronto\u2019s 108-46 mark. In the best-of-nine JWS, Baltimore defeated American Association champion St. Paul in six games for the first of three JWS titles. Bentley\u2019s two homers won Game One, 5-3. He let his arm do the work in Game Three, winning 9-2 to put the Birds within two games of the series win.6 After the Saints broke into the win column in Game Four, the teams traveled to Minnesota. Bentley was back on the mound, winning 6-5 in Game Five, a triumph marred by fan hostility to umpire Otis H. Stocksdale for calling Lawry, who had bunted, safe at first in an inning where the Orioles scored the game\u2019s decisive run. In the same inning, St. Paul pitcher Dan Griner was accused of throwing a shine ball, and a further ruckus ensued.7 The Orioles clinched the series in Game Six. Ogden pitched a 1-0 shutout and Boley\u2019s home run was the only offensive support needed.\n\nBabe Ruth in a borrowed New York Giants uniform, with his former owner Jack Dunn (and Giants player Jack Bentley), before the October 3, 1923, exhibition game between the Giants and the Dunn\u2019s International League Orioles. Ruth, who was a star with the Yankees by then, was enticed to play to be a gate draw. The game\u2019s proceeds went to fundraising for former Giants owner John B. Day and former manager Jim Mutrie. (LIBRARY OF CONGRESS)\n\nIn 1921, Dunn added pitcher Tommy Thomas. Thomas racked up 105 wins in five seasons with the Orioles before being traded to the White Sox for Maurice Archdeacon late in the 1925 season. The deal was announced on September 12, 1925, and Thomas, after spending the balance of the season with Baltimore, joined Chicago for the 1926 season.8\n\nBentley batted .412 with 24 home runs and 120 RBI. His batting average is the IL record. He set a league record of 246 hits that still stands and led in doubles (47), total bases (397) and slugging average (.665). The 24 homers were a league record at the time. On the mound, Bentley was 12-1 with a 2.35 ERA. Being left-handed and with these statistics, it is not surprising that he was starting to be called \u201cThe Babe Ruth of the Minors.\u201d9\n\nBaltimore lost the 1921 JWS to Louisville in eight games.\n\nThe 1922 Orioles had a phenomenal record (115-52) thanks in large part to pitchers who could hit. In addition to Bentley (13-2; .351 batting average and 22 homers), the staff included Parnham (16-10; .315 batting average and six homers), Ogden (24-10; two homers), Thomas (18-9; two homers), and Harry Frank (22-9; one homer).\n\nGrove went 18-8 with a pair of doubles amongst his 13 hits. He remained in Baltimore for 1923 and 1924, compiling a combined record of 53-16. He made his major-league debut in 1925 with the Philadelphia Athletics, and hung around for 17 Hall-of-Fame seasons, compiling a 300-141 record for the A\u2019s and the Boston Red Sox.\n\nBentley hit at least 20 homers in each season from 1920 through 1922. What did he do as a pitcher? A none-too-shabby 41-6. It was his pitching that attracted John McGraw of the Giants who obtained Bentley for $72,500. Bentley was used mostly as a pitcher by the Giants going 40-22 from 1923 through 1925, but did manage to bat .329 with four homers, and went 5-for-12 (.417) in the 1923 and 1924 World Series.10 In 1923, his .412 batting average (28-for-68) set the one-season mark for hitting by National League pitchers. His overall average that year was .427 as he pinch-hit on 22 occasions, going 10-for-21 with a walk.\n\nThe Orioles returned to the Junior World Series in 1922, defeating St. Paul, five games to two.\n\nThe 1923 Orioles went 111-53 and won the IL pennant by 11 games. The core of the team \u2014 Bishop, Boley, Jacobson, Lawry, and Maisel \u2014 was still around, and Bishop led the league in homers with 22. In 1921, Dunn had signed 19-year-old Dick Porter, whom he kept locked up through 1928. Porter batted .316 in 1923. It was the first of six consecutive seasons in which he batted at least .316.\n\nJimmy Walsh was the new first baseman in 1923 and batted .333. He was a 35-year-old veteran who had parts of six seasons in the majors, and had joined Baltimore in 1922, batting .327. It was his second go-around with Baltimore. He had been with the team from 1910 through 1912.\n\nGrove was 27-10 with a league leading 330 strikeouts. Parnham, who had rejoined the team in 1922, was 33-7 in his last great season. In the JWS, Baltimore lost to Kansas City in nine games.\n\nIn 1924, Baltimore went 117-48 and finished 19 games ahead of Toronto. Grove\u2019s pitching (26-6) and Porter\u2019s batting (.363) led the league. The key acquisition that season was George Earnshaw. Dunn held on to Earnshaw until 1928, when the Athletics met Dunn\u2019s price of a reported $80,000. Baltimore lost to St. Paul in a JWS that took 10 games to complete, there being one tie.\n\nIn 1925, three pitchers won at least 28 games. The team\u2019s leader in wins was Thomas with 32. Earnshaw, in his first full season, won 29. Ogden won 28. Baltimore\u2019s 188 homers were tops in the league. In the JWS, Baltimore defeated Louisville in eight games.\n\nThe dynasty would yield ten inductees to the International League Hall of Fame in a steady stream of inductions between 1948 and 1963, with an eleventh, Grove, added in 2008 (after his induction to Cooperstown). Dunn\u2019s Orioles would never again have the glory of those seven great seasons.\n\nALAN COHEN has been a SABR member since 2010.

The Baltimore Sun reported that 6,065 fans attended, a huge number for that era, and the reported number may actually have been larger since throngs of fence climbers made their way over the 12-foot barrier into the park before and during the game. Attendees had picnics on the grass while the game was played, kids frolicked in the nearby fields, and many of the fans may not have noticed when manager Billy Barnie was arrested after the final out.\n\nBilly Barnie, manager of the Baltimore Orioles from 1883 to 1891.\n\nThe New York-born Barnie began his career as a catcher and outfielder for the National Association in 1870s, but wasn\u2019t an everyday player. He started his career playing for the Hartford (Conn.) Dark Blues in 1874, and drifted around the northeast playing for the Keokuck (N.Y.) Westerns and the New York Mutuals through 1875. A journeyman by 24, he bounced around to Columbus, Buffalo and San Francisco trying to find playing time. By 1881 he was playing for the Brooklyn (N.Y.) Atlantics on the Eastern Championship Association, and in 1883 he re-emerged as a manager for the American Association Baltimore Orioles. He even took the field as a catcher in 19 games in 1883 and 1886. He found more success as a manager than a player, but in his eight years in Baltimore never finished above third place. Despite his lack of success he became a local celebrity and was well known in Baltimore.\n\nFans Wanted Sunday Baseball\n\nIn recounting the events of that day, the Sun said that after the umpire ended the game, \u201cBald Billy\u201d Barnie was approached by Anne Arundel County Sheriff James S. Armiger and Deputy James T. Small, who produced a warrant and who placed him under arrest. It was the first time Barnie was ever arrested, he told reporters. He was taken to Justice Thomas Green\u2019s office in Brooklyn and was booked and kept overnight. Justice Green set a $300 bail, and at 10 a.m. the next morning, Acton\u2019s Park owner Samuel G. Acton showed up and bailed the manager out. For his part in the affair, Barnie was fined $5.\n\nTechnically, Barnie was truly responsible for fielding the team that broke the law. He violated Section 247, Article 27 of the State\u2019s Code of Public General Laws by unlawfully playing, or causing to be played, baseball on the Sabbath Day. Yes, there was actually a law on the books prohibiting baseball on Sundays in Maryland. The Old Line State wasn\u2019t alone in that regard; many other states had similar laws. The Orioles charged admission and players were paid, thus making it illegal. Sheriff Armiger sounded almost apologetic in explaining that he was advised by State\u2019s Attorney James Munroe that he must enforce the law against any illegal act.\n\nSome in the press speculated that the Acton\u2019s Park game was meant to test the Sabbath laws, which were beginning to seem antiquated. On that same Sunday the Orioles played in Brooklyn, the Washington Nationals played Wilmington in D.C., but no one was arrested there.\n\nBut why play in Brooklyn? It might have been because the two years the Orioles spent at Oriole Park II were tumultuous, and its location in Waverly in north central Baltimore at Greenmount Avenue and East 29th Street was not well appreciated by fans. Alternatively, it might have been because as a test of the Sabbath laws, the team might have found a more sympathetic host in Anne Arundel County than in Baltimore County. Furthermore, the Long Bridge made Acton\u2019s Park a favorite location among many of Baltimore\u2019s elite. Orioles officials even told the Sun that they were considering making it their new home field. But the team turmoil continued, and Oriole Park III, also known as Union Park, was created in Baltimore at Guilford and 25th Streets.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sabbath laws were slowly being repealed throughout the country, especially in the post-World War I years. Returning servicemen and their families were looking for more types of Sunday recreation. Even with the Acton\u2019s Park \u201ctest\u201d in June 1890, Maryland didn\u2019t completely resolve the Sunday baseball issue until nearly 30 years later when Maryland\u2019s Court of Appeals overturned Sabbath Blue Laws in 1919. Acton\u2019s Park barely lasted that long. Its longtime owner, Samuel G. Acton, died in 1903, and by 1919 Baltimore had annexed Brooklyn and was selling the property for industrial uses. By then the Orioles had moved on to a new Baltimore location, Oriole Park V, also known as Terrapins Park, at Greenmount and 29th Streets.\n\nA Seminal, Sloppy Sunday Game\n\nSo what happened on the field that day in 1890? The Orioles held off the Hartfords 11\u20138 in a sloppy game that the Sun called \u201cinteresting.\u201d Catcher George Townsend was the hero, going three-for-three and driving in three runs. Norm Baker was the Orioles winning pitcher. But the Orioles certainly won ugly. Combined, both Baker and Hartford pitcher, James Lyston (a Baltimore native), gave up only six earned runs. But Baker walked four and Lyston handed out seven free passes. The Orioles logged six errors on a dry field worn down by local teams; Hartford had three errors of their own. The Orioles ran rampant on Hartford catcher, Alfred Moore, stealing eight bases that day. The crowd was large and boisterous, but the Orioles didn\u2019t play great baseball. And then skipper Billy Barnie went to jail."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/teams/balt.shtml", "page_content": "BALTIMORE ORIOLES\n\nThe Official History of the Baltimore Orioles | Baseball Almanac\n\nBaltimore had a gritty taste of baseball in the late 19th century with a team of hard-nosed Orioles who hit with their fists as often as they did with bats. The team read like a \"Who's Who\" of 19th century stars, including Wee Willie Keeler, Wilbert Robinson, Hughie Jennings, John McGraw and Ned Hanlon. These Orioles joined the new American League as a charter franchise in 1901.\n\nBut behind the scenes, American League President Ban Johnson believed for his fledgling league to succeed he needed a team in New York City. With the help of two businessmen, he maneuvered the Orioles out of Baltimore and into New York, where they eventually became the Yankees. The city of Baltimore would go another half-century without a major league team.\n\nST. LOUIS BROWNS HISTORY\n\nMeanwhile, about 800 miles to the west, the future Orioles were born when St. Louis joined the American League in 1902 with a team transplanted from Milwaukee (the original Milwaukee Brewers had been an American League charter franchise in 1901 but finished dead last). The team was christened the Browns in honor of the St. Louis Brown Stockings, an American Association team which had won four consecutive pennants in the 1880's.\n\nThe Browns debuted on April 23, 1902, defeating Cleveland 5-2 at Sportsman's Park. It was a rare highlight for a team that finished sixth that first season, and rarely did much better during the next half-century. They endured so much losing that sportswriters said of St. Louis, \"First in booze, first in shoes and last in the American League.\"\n\nThe Browns had a brief run of first-division success in the early 1920's led by George Sisler, the premier hit-maker of his era. Sisler's 257 hits in 1920 stood as the single season standard until passed by Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki in 2004; his .420 average in 1922 is still the third highest single season average on record since 1900. Sisler was backed by a solid outfield trio of Ken Williams (1922 home run champion), Baby Doll Jacobson and Jack Tobin.\n\nDuring this brief run of quality, the Browns made a momentous mistake unnoticed in most quarters. They dismissed a young, front office executive named Branch Rickey, who went on to build dynasties with the Cardinals and Dodgers.\n\nAfter the brief glory of the early 1920's, the Browns fell back to second division status, reaching a new level of haplessness in 1939 when they drew only 81,000 fans FOR THE ENTIRE SEASON.\n\nThe Browns fortunes turned upward one more time when they captured the 1944 pennant with the leadership of manager Luke Sewell and slugging shortstop Vern Stephens (league leading one-hundred nine runs batted in). The success hardly won the Browns respect, as the running joke at the time said that baseball talent was so diluted by World War II, even the Browns could win.\n\nAlthough they won two of the first three games, the Browns lost their only World Series to their cross-town rival Cardinals. They finished third in 1945, and then plummeted to the bottom of the American League never to see the first division again.\n\nAn executive with a flair for promotion named Bill Veeck bought the team in the early 1950's, but his imagination could not hide reality - the team was in dire straits with minimal attendance and no money to attract or retain talent.\n\nVeeck sold the team to a Baltimore conglomerate after the Browns played their final game on September 27, 1953, losing 2-1 to the Chicago White Sox. Fittingly, it was the team's 100th loss of the season.\n\nBALTIMORE ORIOLES HISTORY\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles picked up where the Browns left off, losing their inaugural game to Detroit, 3-0 on April 13, 1954. They would lose ninety-nine more games that season and finished 57\u00bd games behind Cleveland (which set the American League record at the time of 111 wins).\n\nThe Orioles made an inspired choice by hiring well respected baseball executive Paul Richards into the front office, and, with an emphasis on pitching and defense, the team began a steady climb. By the early 1960's the Orioles were a young club on the rise, and when they completed the one-sided trade with Cincinnati for Frank Robinson prior to the 1966 season, they became a powerhouse.\n\nLed by Robinson's triple crown season (.316 average, 49 homers and 122 RBIs) they won their first World Series championship in 1966. Earl Weaver succeeded Hank Bauer midway through the 1968 season and the Orioles marched to three consecutive pennants, winning 109, 108 and 101 games in 1969-71. They won five of the first six American League East titles and the 1970 world championship.\n\nAlong with the fiery Robinson's leadership on and off the field, they featured slugging first baseman Boog Powell, an air tight defense with Brooks Robinson and Mark Belanger on the infield and Paul Blair anchoring the outfield. Their pitching dominated, reaching its apex in 1971 when all four starters - Dave McNally (21 victories) Jim Palmer (20), Mike Cuellar (20) and Pat Dobson (20) - each won 20 games.\n\nWeaver and the front office kept the Orioles in contention through the 1970's and the advent of free agency, when they lost many of their stars in the later part of the decade. Continued player development, astute trades and pitching were the keys, as Weaver juggled lineups and players through some offensively challenged years.\n\nThey made it back to the World Series in 1979, although they lost to Pittsburgh in seven games. They were back again in 1983 with new manager Joe Altobelli and defeated Philadelphia. This time, the sluggers were Eddie Murray, Ken Singleton and Cal Ripken, Jr., and the dominating pitchers were Mike Boddicker, Scott McGregor, Mike Flanagan and Tippy Martinez.\n\nThe Orioles hit a downward spiral after the 1983 championship. During the next decade the team finished no better than third place, frequently doing much worse - such as the last-place 107 loss effort in 1988.\n\nThe franchise and the fans were rejuvenated by the opening of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in 1992. The Orioles won a wild-card berth in 1996 and the American League East in 1997. The franchise experienced another lull well into the next decade, as an emphasis on redeveloping the farm system and young talent slowed results on the field.\n\nThe Orioles reached the postseason in 2012 after a 15-year absence when Baltimore defeated the Texas Rangers in the American League Wild Card Game. The Orioles went to the playoffs in 2014 and 2016. Under manager Buck Showalter, the Orioles earned a spot in the 2014 ALCS against the Kansas City Royals and were swept in four games, 4-0.\n\nOverall, since moving to Baltimore, the Orioles have had considerably more success than their St. Louis forefathers, winning eight division titles, six American League pennants and three world championships."}, {"url": "https://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/player.php?p=barnibi01", "page_content": "Billy Barnie was born on Wednesday, January 26, 1853, in New York, New York.

Literally. He played for the Hartford Dark Blues (1874), Keokuk Westerns (1875) and New York Mutuals (1875) of the National Assn. and the Baltimore Orioles (1883, 1886) of the American Assn. He also managed the Orioles (1883-91), Washington Senators (1892), Louisville Colonels (1893-4) and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (1897-8).\n\nA New York native, Barnie started playing on local teams in 1870 before turning pro. He joined Hartford in 1874 and, as a rookie, led the league\u2026 in strikeouts (with 13). He also had a .184/.188./.226 slash line. The following season, he played in 10 games for the Keokuk (Iowa) Westerns, hitting .111. The Westerns folded after going 1-12 in their first 13 games, and Barnie signed on with the Mutuals as a backup to catcher/manager Nat Hicks. He had 5 hits in 34 at-bats for New York, bringing his 1875 batting average up to .129. Barnie would go on to insert himself into a few games when he was managing the Orioles and even had a .200 average in 17 games in 1883. All total, he hit .171 in 83 career games, with 55 hits, 23 RBIs and 32 runs scored.\n\nBarnie finished his full-time playing career in independent leagues. While nursing a hand injury in 1877 while playing for Buffalo of the League Alliance in 1877, the 24-year-old was given his first change to manage a ballclub. He\u2019d play a few seasons more, including the San Francisco Knickerbockers of the Pacific League, but his future in baseball would lie in managing.\n\nBarnie was a part of The Baseball Convention of 1881, which gave rise to the American Association as a competitor to the National League. Earlier that year, he\u2019d helped organize the Eastern Championship Association and ran the Brooklyn Atlantics team, so he was already familiar with getting a new league off the ground. He wanted a team of his own, but his financial backing was lacking. He and his partner A.J. Houck did get the Baltimore franchise in late 1882, and Barnie would spend the next 9 years as its manager.\n\nThe Orioles didn\u2019t see that much success under Barnie\u2019s tenure as part owner and manager, finishing as high as third just once. The Baltimore Sun said, \u201c\u2026his kind-hearted and easy-going ways causing players to impose on him and preventing him from making changes at times that would have been of benefit.\u201d He was succeeded by Ned Hanlon who, in his quietly ruthless way, made the changes that needed to be made for the good of the team. The Orioles would go on to win the AA championship three times under Hanlon.\n\nBarnie agreed to helm the NL\u2019s Senators in 1892. That arrangement lasted just 2 games. It seems like there was a power struggle between Barnie and the new owner. The Boston Globe reported on January 7 that Washington\u2019s shareholders put Barnie in charge of the club. Ten days later, though, it was reported that George Wagner had acquired 26 of the 29 shares, giving him absolute power. The Senators started the season with two losses, and Barnie, though he said he was given the change to manage for the whole season, was let go. No reason was given for his termination, he said.\n\nBarnie spent the rest of his life bouncing between managerial assignments in the National League and independent leagues. His time in Louisville ended when the 1895 Colonels won just 35 games while losing 95. His final run in the National League with the Bridegrooms lasted until 1898, when he was fired by Brooklyn as one of Charles Ebbets\u2019 first moves as the new owner. In 14 years as a pro manager, he went 470-548 for a .462 win %. He was credited with mentoring stars like King Kelly, Matt Kilroy and Mike Griffin. Ironically, Griffin would eventually be Barnie\u2019s replacement as the Brooklyn manager, following Ebbets\u2019 short-lived attempt at managing his own team.\n\nBarnie kept managing in the Eastern League, first in Springfield and then, until his death, in Hartford. Though he was said to be the \u201cpicture of health\u201d when he went to attend an Elks meeting in Atlantic City in early July 1900, he took ill. He returned to Hartford and died there on July 15 of pneumonia. He was 47 years old. Barnie is buried in the Paterson Family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nOddly, it was the second time that an Elks meeting in Atlantic City proved to be disastrous to his health. Barnie, along with several others, was injured in a stage collapse at an Elks meeting in 1896. He had been entertaining the crowd by singing when the accident occurred. His obituary stated that he never fully recovered from his unspecified injuries.\n\nAdvertisement"}, {"url": "https://www.baltimorebaseball.com/2020/06/27/call-pen-remembering-1890s-orioles-baltimores-first-champs/", "page_content": "Most baseball fans who live in Baltimore know about the great Orioles teams who won six pennants and three Worlds Series between 1966 and 1983, including three pennants in a row from 1969-1971.\n\nHowever, many Baltimoreans may not realize that more than 70 years before the St. Louis Browns moved to Baltimore in 1954 to become our Orioles, another professional team by the same name roamed four different ballparks that stood in various locations in the area just west of Greenmount Avenue between 24th and 29th Street. Between 1894 and 1896, these Orioles won three consecutive National League pennants. That\u2019s right, the Orioles were once in the National League.\n\nThe first Orioles team was in the American Association, a professional league that competed with the NL between 1882 and 1891, but when the AA folded at the end of the 1891 season, the Orioles were accepted into the NL.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Orioles of the AA were a mediocre team at best, so a mere 12 games into their inaugural season in the NL, team owner and local brewery magnate Harry Von der Horst hired Edward \u201cNed\u201d Hanlon as the team\u2019s manager. This proved to be a momentous decision, and Von der Horst promised he would stay out of Hanlon\u2019s way \u2014 he even wore a button that said, \u201cAsk Hanlon\u201d to deflect people from approaching him with management suggestions.\n\nIn his first two years, Hanlon purged the roster of unmotivated and untalented players, hired young and hungry ones to replace them, and instituted and relentlessly drilled his players in an innovative style of play that would turn the Orioles into a championship team that eventually dominated the league.\n\nNicknamed \u201cFoxy Ned\u201d and \u201cThe Father of Modern Baseball,\u201d Hanlon revolutionized the game by devising or popularizing what became known as \u201cInside\u201d baseball, which featured an aggressive brand of in-your-face play that employed the hit-and-run, expert bunting, the \u201cBaltimore chop,\u201d the squeeze, and other innovations such as having the pitcher cover first base on balls hit to the right side of the infield.\n\nDuring Hanlon\u2019s seven-year tenure as the manager of the O\u2019s, he compiled a 555-361 record (.601) and led the team to three straight pennants and two second-place finishes. The Orioles also won two Temple Cup Championships, a precursor of the modern World Series where the first- and second-place teams in the league played a best-of-seven series. And Hanlon is also generally credited with bringing the orange and black colors to the team\u2019s uniforms.\n\nHanlon was acknowledged as being an excellent judge of baseball talent, and he assembled teams with great players. Wee Willie Keeler, Dan Brouthers, John McGraw, Hughie Jennings, Joe Kelley, and Wilbert Robinson were mainstays of the pennant-winning teams. He also added other accomplished players, including Walter \u201cSteve\u201d Brodie (who recited Shakespeare in center field), Heinie Reitz, \u201cDirty\u201d Jack Doyle, Bill \u201cBoileryard\u201d Clarke, and Frank Foreman (a life-long Hampden resident).\n\nNotable Oriole pitchers were Tony Mullane (who won 284 games in his career), the dependable Sadie McMahon, Jerry Nops, and Kid Gleeson (who later was the unfortunate manager of the infamous 1919 Black Sox).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe baseball played during this time was no place for the faint of heart. The game routinely featured frequent fights between players, abominably foul and offensive language, crowd riots, rabid \u201ccranks\u201d (the word for fans in those days) who abused opposing players and umpires, and a flagrant disregard of rules by all teams.\n\nBecause there was normally only one umpire who could not see everything, players commonly cheated by taking short cuts around the bases, interfering with runners in the base paths, and a multitude of other infractions. Most regarded the Orioles as the dirtiest team, and one reporter of the time commented that \u201cMcGraw uses every low and contemptible method that his erratic brain can conceive to win a play by a dirty trick.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Orioles were notorious for \u201ckicking.\u201d The term refers to umpire baiting; however, \u201cvirulent abuse\u201d might be a more accurate description. Almost to a man, the 1890s\u2019 Orioles probably could have taught Earl Weaver a thing or two. The Orioles became the darlings of Baltimore, but because of their unscrupulous antics and success in winning games, they were generally despised by the rest of the baseball world \u2014 the first \u201cEvil Empire\u201d of sports.\n\nWhen the league contracted after the 1889 season, the Orioles were one of four teams that were bounced out, but a new Orioles team joined the newly formed American League in 1901. During the first two years they were managed by John McGraw and played their games at the American League Park where a McDonalds now stands just south of 29th Street. But after the 1902 season, the franchise was moved to New York to become the New York Highlanders, later renamed the Yankees \u2014 the \u201cEvil Empire\u201d of modern baseball.\n\nSix men who played for the Orioles during Hanlon\u2019s tenure end up the Hall of Fame: Brouthers, McGraw, Jennings, Keeler, Kelley, and Robinson. Hanlon followed his boys into the Hall in 1996. McGraw went on to manage the New York Giants for 30 years and won a total a total of 2,784 games (second only to Connie Mack), 10 pennants and three World Series. Jennings managed the Detroit Tigers and Ty Cobb for 12 years and won more than 1,100 games and two pennants. Robinson managed the NL Brooklyn Robins (named after him) for 18 years, winning more than 1,300 games and two pennants. Hanlon later managed the Brooklyn Superbas of the NL for seven years and won two pennants and the Chronicle-Telegraph Cup in 1900 (another precursor of the World Series).\n\nThe 1890s\u2019 Orioles were a fleeting moment baseball history in Baltimore, but what a time it was. If you know where to look, vestiges of these players and those times can still be found. Until his death in 1937, Hanlon lived for more than 30 years at 1401 Mount Royal Avenue in the Bolton Hill section of Baltimore. He was a city park commissioner for almost 20 years and working for him there was his old centerfielder, Steve Brodie, whose job it was to lay out baseball diamonds in the city parks. Brodie\u2019s longtime home where he died in 1935 still stands at 2729 Maryland Avenue.\n\nIn Charles Village, within walking distance of the old ballparks, the homes of John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson (2738 and 2740 St. Paul Street) still stand side-by-side. Tragically, McGraw\u2019s first wife, Minnie, died there of at age 23 of a ruptured appendix. A block away you can still see Joe Kelley\u2019s house at 2826 N. Calvert Street where his funeral was held in 1943. Throughout that neighborhood, there are other sites of significance to those old Orioles.\n\nThen there are the old ballparks where some of most hallowed names in baseball history challenged the Orioles: Cy Young, Honus Wagner, Cap Anson, Ed Delahanty, Nap Lajoie, Charlie Comiskey, Connie Mack, Amos Rusie, Kid Nichols, and Rube Waddell \u2014 just to name a few. No physical structures of those parks remain, but you can retrace their perimeters and walk the glorious grounds of Union Park where Hanlon\u2019s teams won their three pennants.\n\nThe site is located in-between Barclay Street to the east, Hunter Alley to the west, and in-between 25th and 24th Streets. If you look at the extant photos of Union Park, you can clearly see the buildings along 25th and Barclay Streets that once overlooked the old park. They now serve as silent guardians of the memories of Baltimore\u2019s first champions.\n\nAnd over at New Cathedral Cemetery here in Baltimore, Hanlon, McGraw, Robinson, and Kelley are all buried. No cemetery in the country is the final resting place of so many Hall of Famers.\n\nTom Delise grew up in New York as a Mets fan and Yankee hater, and to this day, Tom Seaver is his baseball hero. He has lived in Baltimore for 34 years and has held season tickets for the Orioles since 1992 and the Ravens since they moved here. He retired in 2018 after a 40-year career as an English teacher and now spends much of his time reading, especially about \u201cold time\u201d baseball. He lives in the Bolton Hill section of Baltimore with his wife Christine and his dogs Shakespeare and Cordelia.\n\nJack Gibbons spent 46 years in sports journalism, including a chunk of that time as sports editor of The Baltimore Sun.

Gattie\n\nThis article was published in The National Pastime: A Bird\u2019s-Eye View of Baltimore (2020)\n\nProfessional baseball\u2019s first Baltimore Orioles played in the American Association (AA) in 1882. Another franchise of the same name played in the AA from 1883 until joining the National League (NL) for nine seasons, from 1891 through 1899, but the NL vacated four cities after the 1899 season. The following season, the Western League\u2019s owners changed the name of their organization to the American League and sought to establish the AL as a rival major league to the NL. They seized the opportunity to replace former NL franchises with AL teams in Baltimore, Washington, and Cleveland.1 The American League\u2019s Baltimore Orioles was created as a member of the junior circuit on January 4, 1901.\n\nAlthough Johnson desperately wanted a franchise in New York City, the politically powerful New York Giants successfully prevented the AL from moving there. Instead, Johnson placed a team in Baltimore and recruited John McGraw to lead the new franchise. The ballclub was incorporated as the \u201cBaltimore Baseball and Athletic Company\u201d and originally issued 400 shares of stock valued at $100 apiece. The initial incorporators included players McGraw and Robinson, Justice Harry Goldman, Eutaw House proprietor Col. James P. Shannon, St. Vincent\u2019s Catholic Church pastor Reverend John D. Boland, city tax judge Conway W. Sams, and Baltimore businessmen S. Miles Brinkley and Moses N. Frank.2\n\nBaltimore fans waited out two consecutive rainouts before celebrating Opening Day on April 26, 1901. The afternoon festivities included a procession of nearly 50 carriages from the Eutaw House Hotel to American League Park and pregame activities included Johnson throwing the ceremonial first pitch.3 The Orioles won their inaugural game over the Boston Americans in front of over 10,000 fans, 10-6, led by Mike Donlin\u2019s two triples and Joe McGinnity\u2019s complete game.4 The Orioles occupied second place during mid-May, then slumped to fourth place following a four-game losing streak.\n\nThe team endured a challenging early June. After winning their first two games that month, the Orioles lost eight of their next ten contests. They fell to sixth place and 7\u00bd games behind the league-leading Chicago White Sox following a 7\u20136 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. The Orioles had built a 6\u20131 lead after six innings and outhit Milwaukee 15-13, but the Brewers scored six unanswered runs, winning the 10-inning contest on a sacrifice fly following an errant throw. Frustrated with the team\u2019s ability to lose ballgames apparently within their grasp, one newspaper reporter noted, \u201cIf the defeats in themselves are becoming somewhat monotonous, the Orioles manage to have a charming variety in the methods by which they lose.\u201d5\n\nThroughout the season, McGraw attempted to improve his team by recruiting players from other teams, including NL ballclubs. One of McGraw\u2019s top targets was his previous teammate and future Hall of Fame shortstop Hughie Jennings. Jennings was traded from Louisville to Baltimore in 1893 and played with the NL Orioles through the 1898 season, where he became the NL\u2019s top shortstop. Throughout June, four different ballclubs sought Jennings\u2019 services, including Baltimore, the AL Philadelphia Athletics, and the NL Philadelphia Phillies.6\n\nAlthough McGraw stated Jennings would play in Baltimore, President Johnson overrode McGraw and recognized the Athletics\u2019 claim, stating \u201cLaw and order must prevail in the American League, and the Baltimore club will not be allowed to have its own way any more than any other club. McGraw hasn\u2019t a leg to stand upon in this matter, and if he drives Jennings into the National League the Athletic club deserves some redress for which Baltimore should be held responsible.\u201d7\n\nMcGraw rebutted Johnson\u2019s remarks, claiming Jennings hadn\u2019t been claimed when negotiations occurred, and that Johnson interfered because of his friendly relationship with Athletics\u2019 owner Connie Mack. Jennings ultimately played for neither the Orioles nor the Athletics, opting for the Phillies instead. The dispute over Jennings foreshadowed future McGraw-Johnson tussles.\n\nThe next day Baltimore defeated Milwaukee 11-4, the first of 11 consecutive wins, their longest winning streak that season. Their victories included sweeps of Detroit and Philadelphia and moved the Orioles into third place. Unfortunately, injuries to McGraw, Robinson, and other key players, along with frequent umpire troubles, led to a late season swoon and eventual fifth-place finish.8 The Orioles struggled during early September, compiling a 4-19-2 record from August 27 through September 18, then finished the season on a high note, winning eight straight before losing the season finale; after their eighth-straight win, one reporter observed, \u201cThere was nothing sensational about the game, but throughout there was the pleasant feeling of hopeful confidence.\u201d9 Their late September streak pushed Baltimore back over the .500 mark, widening the gap between them and the sixth-place Washington Senators.\n\nBased on their early season success, fans \u201cconfidently expected that by this time they would certainly be running neck and neck for second place and more probably fighting desperately for first.\u201d10 The Orioles ultimately compiled a 68-65 record, 13\u00bd games behind the pennant-winning Chicago White Sox. The Orioles led the AL with a .294 team batting average and a .353 team on-base average, while finishing third with 761 runs and 1,348 hits. McGraw, who managed and played third base before a mid-season injury, led the team with a .349 batting average and .995 OPS while pacing the AL with 14 hit-by-pitches in only 308 plate appearances; outfielder Mike Donlin led the full-season regulars with a .340 batting average and .883 OPS. Second baseman Jimmy Williams and shortstop Bill Keister each hit 21 triples and drove in over 90 runs. Baltimore\u2019s pitching staff, which had the highest average age in the league (29.0 years), attained a fourth-best 3.73 ERA, collectively struck out a league-low 271 opponents, and issued a near-league average 344 walks. Joe McGinnity, returning to Baltimore and among those jumping from the NL to the AL, led Orioles hurlers with a 3.56 ERA, 26 wins, and 382 innings. The American League thrived during its first year as a self-proclaimed major league, and only one franchise changed locations during the off-season. (The Milwaukee Brewers moved to St. Louis and were renamed the Browns.)\n\nThe Orioles started 1902 on the right foot. On January 1, Baltimore announced they signed Joe McGinnity to a three-year deal. McGinnity had been pursued by the NL\u2019s Brooklyn Superbas; he had been assigned to Brooklyn before the 1900 season, then jumped to Baltimore before the 1901 season. As the season approached, McGraw set his everyday lineup with shortstop Billy Gilbert leading off, followed by outfielder Jimmy Sheckard, third baseman Joe Kelley, outfielder Cy Seymour, second baseman Jimmy Williams, outfielder Kip Selbach, first baseman Dan McGann, the catcher, and the pitcher.11 The Orioles\u2019 roster experienced significant turnover during the season; only Harry Howell, Wilbert Robinson, Gilbert, Seymour, Selbach, and Williams played in at least half of Baltimore\u2019s 138 games.\n\nSimilar to their inaugural season, the Orioles planned a gala parade for Opening Day 1902. On April 23, the procession would leave the Eutaw House and travel throughout the city to the ballgrounds. There were plans for \u201c12 mounted patrolmen and Packard\u2019s Band of 30 pieces\u201d as well. However, unlike the previous season, no complimentary tickets were issued for Opening Day.12 Due to a last-minute scheduling change, the Orioles opened their 1902 campaign in Boston before returning to Baltimore and hosting the Athletics for the home opener. On April 19, Baltimore carried a 6-3 lead heading into the ninth inning, scoring insurance runs during the eighth and ninth frames. Unfortunately for the Orioles, a late Boston rally resulted in four answered runs as Baltimore dropped the season opener.13 They didn\u2019t fare better in their home opener, losing to Philadelphia, 8-1, though over 10,000 fans attended the ballgame.14\n\nBaltimore endured a challenging season. Although the Orioles won four of their next six contests, they lost their next five games and slipped to seventh place. The team struggled and McGraw argued with Johnson and AL umpires while the wheels were set in motion for his eventual jump to the New York Giants. After May 2, the Orioles\u2019 highest placement for the season was fourth place; their last day in the league\u2019s upper division was June 14. However, there were reasons for hope throughout the season\u2019s first half. On May 9, McGraw returned from a five-game suspension, and the Orioles \u201cplayed like a new team\u201d as they defeated Philadelphia, 13-6, to end their five-game losing streak and knock the Athletics from the AL\u2019s top spot. The ballclub was praised for resurrecting the hit-and-run, Gilbert\u2019s excellent fielding was commended, and Williams homered.15 On May 30, the Orioles swept a doubleheader from Cleveland, winning by scores of 10-7 and 12-4. The opening line from the Baltimore Sun\u2019s game recap read: \u201cIt was a great day for Baltimore \u2014 a great day.\u201d16\n\nBaltimore split the next four games; the last time the Orioles had a .500 or better winning percentage was on June 4. Their season started spiraling downward in late June and reached a low point on July 17, when they were forced to forfeit a game against the St. Louis Browns, the day after McGraw joined the New York Giants as manager. A few weeks earlier, on June 30, Johnson had suspended McGraw and Joseph Kelley indefinitely for their actions during the previous Saturday\u2019s ballgame against Boston. Johnson commented on McGraw\u2019s actions, \u201cI have had time enough since I returned from the North to make a thorough investigation of this Baltimore trouble, and I am convinced that Umpire Connolly was absolutely right.\u201d17 Robinson was named manager in McGraw\u2019s absence. Infuriated with his continued treatment by Johnson, McGraw left the AL for the Giants, where he would manage for 31 seasons and win over 2500 ballgames.\n\nIn addition to securing McGraw, the Giants signed McGinnity, Cronin, Bresnahan, and McGann to contracts \u2014 and Kelley and Seymour jumped to Cincinnati \u2014 leaving the Orioles without enough players to field a team.18 Johnson pieced together a roster with players from other AL clubs \u2014 and the old Baltimore NL club19 \u2014 so the Orioles could finish the season. The Orioles stumbled to the finish line, compiling an 8-20 record in August and 5-23 record in September, which included an 11-game losing streak.\n\nBaltimore finished last at 50-88, 34 games behind the pennant-winning Philadelphia Athletics. Outfielder Kip Selbach, one of only three Orioles to play at least 100 games that season, lead the team in most offensive categories: plate appearances (573), runs (86), hits (161), and batting average (.320), with second baseman Jimmy Williams tallying the most triples (21), home runs (8), and best OPS (.861) on the team. McGinnity, despite leaving for New York in July, still led Baltimore hurlers with 13 wins and a 3.44 ERA, and finished second with 198\u2154 innings pitched, just behind Harry Howell\u2019s 199 innings.\n\nPresident Johnson successfully moved the AL Orioles\u2019 franchise from Baltimore to New York for the 1903 season.20 In March, the American League\u2019s New York franchise was approved and commenced operations, incorporated as the Greater New York Baseball Association.21 The rebranded New York Americans, variously nicknamed \u201cHilltoppers\u201d and \u201cHighlanders\u201d in the press for the playing field located on elevated terrain, and \u201cYankees\u201d possibly tongue-in-cheek because the ballpark was slightly north of the Giants\u2019, would use \u201cYankees\u201d as the team\u2019s primary nickname starting in 1913.22 The AL would not return to Baltimore for over fifty years, until the 1954 season when the St. Louis Browns moved east and became the second AL incarnation of the Orioles.\n\nThough the franchise shifted from Baltimore to New York, the statistics associated with the 1901\u201302 Baltimore Orioles have been relegated to those of a defunct organization. The New York Yankees don\u2019t recognize the Baltimore Orioles in their official team records. Baseball-Reference.com published an article on the debate in 2014.23 The current Baltimore Orioles trace their history from the AL charter member Milwaukee Brewers, through the St. Louis Browns and the 1953 season, to Baltimore in time for the 1954 campaign.\n\nThe 1901\u201302 Baltimore Orioles left a notable mark on baseball history during their short existence. Baltimore compiled a 118-153 record over their two seasons. The Orioles had only two managers in its history: Hall of Famers McGraw and Robinson, who both later managed New York-based NL teams (Robinson joining Brooklyn, where he would manage 1914-31). Their biggest hitting and pitching stars \u2014 Jimmy Williams was their best offensive player, while Joe McGinnity more firmly established his status as a top-tier major league pitcher\u2013would shine in New York over the next five years for the Yankees and Giants, respectively. Bitterness lingered between Johnson and McGraw; the 1904 World Series wasn\u2019t played in large part because McGraw didn\u2019t want his Giants to play the AL pennant winner, spiting Johnson and his attempts to establish the AL\u2019s status as equal to the NL.\n\nThese early Baltimore Orioles should be remembered as having a key location for a major league franchise, serving a critical role in the evolution of the AL-NL relationship, and the lasting impact on New York baseball, between McGraw\u2019s tenure with the Giants, Robinson\u2019s years with the Robins (later Dodgers), and the franchise\u2019s rebirth as the New York Yankees.\n\nGORDON J.
