The party held its 44th National Convention last weekend with record attendance in Laugardalsh\u00f6ll in Reykjav\u00edk. Benediktsson received 1010 out of total 1712 votes cast whereas \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson received 687 votes. Blank and void bills were 9 and others received 3 votes.\n\nA surprise challenge\n\nIt was only a few days before the meeting that \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson announced his intention of challenging Benediktsson for the leadership role and it caused quite a stir in the party. It was widely thought that \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson had been planning this move for up to two months, although it was only revealed shortly before the National meeting.\n\nBjarni Benediktsson and his wife, \u00de\u00f3ra Margr\u00e9t Baldvinsd\u00f3ttir. mbl.is/Eggert J\u00f3hannesson\n\n\"I'm in on it\"\n\n\u201cWhen you say, \u2018Let\u2019s do better, let\u2019s go further and jump a step higher,\u2019 I say, \u2018I\u2019m in on it!\u2019 \u201d said Bjarni when addressing party members once his win was secured and announced shortly after lunchtime on Sunday.\n\nBjarni has chaired the Independence Party since 2009, having succeeded Geir H. Haarde in his time.\n\nHe has been re-elected as chairman five times since then, at the party's national conferences, and this is therefore the sixth time. He has now been re-elected five times, and has had better representation on all occasions.\n\nBjarni Benediktsson and Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson. Composition image\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on the results\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r announced his candidacy on October 30th, or less than a week before the National Convention. It had become clear who would have a seat at the meeting. The last few days, the heat was turning up in the competition with supporters of each of the two candidates exchanging accusations of bad practices from the other.\n\nFew of the country's political scientists dared to predict the outcome, and it was widely assumed that a group of people would only make up their minds at the convention, after the end of each candidate's respective speeches.\n\nTurn defence into offense\n\n\u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson emphasized that the Independence Party must turn defense into a new offense, accusing the current leadership of having lost faith in the fact that it was a possibility. Benediktsson again pointed to the fact that party members were looking at the society that had been successfully created during the Independence Party\u2019s leadership and its steady hand in government.\n\nDelivering results\n\n\u201cI have always focused on delivering results for people, but this challenge shines a light on areas we can improve on, like being more active in listening to all the voices in the party,\u201d said Benediktsson to mbl.is after the results were clear.\n\n\u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds Kolbr\u00fan R. Gylfad\u00f3ttir Minister of Foreign Affairs was elected vice chairman of the Independence Party. mbl.is/Eggert J\u00f3hannesson\n\n\u201cWe need to heed to the call to continue the conversation but it is my belief that it is our good results and ongoing plans to continue delivering results that secured this win.\u201d\n\nMembers of the party must be a team\n\n- \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson got a fairly good vote, do you see that you\u2019ll be doing a lot of work to re-unify the party after this election?\n\n\"On my part, I see us coming together and becoming one team, so I don't have any major concerns about it at this point.\"\n\n- So you have no concerns about the approximately 600 votes?\n\nVilhj\u00e1lmur \u00c1rnason was elected the Secretary of the Independence Party. mbl.is/Eggert J\u00f3hannesson\n\n\u201cNo, I mean \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson got three thousand votes in a runoff election just over a year ago. He is leading the party in Reykjavik, which is of course a key constituency at the national level, and that\u2019s why it was always expected that he had some group of supporters here at the meeting, but I think it was a decisive victory.\u201d\n\nAsked what he takes with him from this experience of the National Convention, Bjarni says he feels the great will of all party members to participate and be active in the party.\n\nWill this change \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson's position in the party?\n\n\"Everybody is willing to contribute. People come here because they are interested in political issues and the political process and they are concerned with their community. We need to mobilise that interest finding a platform for it and a way forward.\u201d\n\n- Will these results have any consequences for \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson within the party?\n\n\"No, I'm not thinking about any of that right now at this point. I'm just happy with the result.\"\n\n-How will you celebrate your victory?\n\n\"With all my best people, all the people who have been supporting me. My family has something planned.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.government.is/diplomatic-missions/embassy-article/2020/09/29/Speech-at-the-75th-United-Nations-General-Assembly-by-H.E.-Mr.-Gudlaugur-Thor-Thordarson-Minister-for-Foreign-Affairs-and-Development-Cooperation/", "page_content": "75 United Nations General Assembly\n\nSpeech by\n\nH.E. Mr. Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Development Cooperation of Iceland\n\nMr President, Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen,\n\n\n\nLet me start by thanking the UN Secretary-General, for his leadership in these difficult times. I also express gratitude to the dedicated staff of this organization, often working in very challenging circumstances, for their commitment and courage.\n\n\n\nThe international community comes together for the 75th anniversary of the United Nations under exceptional circumstances - amid a global crisis.\n\n\n\nIceland is fully committed to support the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have contributed to the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, to the UN Response and Recovery Fund and to several other initiatives, including the development, distribution, and fair and equal access to a possible vaccine for every country.\n\n\n\nThis crisis will have long-term implications for our economies and societies, pushing millions of peoples further behind, not least the most vulnerable. We must, therefore, redouble our collective efforts and pursue the Sustainable Development Goals with vigour.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nThe pandemic has revealed that our fate is interlinked with the successes and failures of others. This very same revelation brought the founders of this great organisation together in 1945, after having lived through the horrors of two world wars. They understood then, as we must now, that we are stronger together than apart.\n\n\n\nThis notion is evident to a small state like Iceland, but larger states also gain from a well-functioning international rules-based order: peace, prosperity and partnerships for our people and planet. For the gravest challenges we face today can only be addressed collectively.\n\n\n\nThe current situation provides us with a perspective. Even if we still have a long way to go, we have witnessed significant achievements over the past 75 years. States have gained their independence, women have gained agency, more parents see their children grow up to become healthy adults, and millions have risen from poverty. Wild polio has recently been eradicated in Africa, a welcome sign of hope in the context of today\u2019s challenges. By most measures, we have been living in times of unprecedented prosperity, something we now know, should not be taken for granted.\n\n\n\nIt is critical that we fight to maintain and improve the multilateral system and oppose/question those who seek to undermine it. We must ensure that our institutions, actions and tools are fit for purpose \u2013 so that the system can continue to serve all of us. The Secretary-General's ongoing reform agenda has our full support.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nThe greatest challenge of our time can only be addressed through joint efforts. Climate action needs to be at the heart of our efforts as we build back better and greener after the pandemic. The Paris Agreement is the global baseline, and Iceland is fully committed to its implementation. To build back greener, we need to make full use of science, innovation, and positive financial stimulus for the full participation of the private sector.\n\n\n\nIceland's new climate action plan, released earlier this summer, goes even further than was agreed in Paris. Our goal is to achieve 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and full carbon neutrality by 2040.\n\n\n\nSustainable management of natural resources and the use of renewable energy will be instrumental if we are to combat climate change. That includes the sustainable use of our oceans, a major carbon sink, continuously threatened by climate change, pollution, and mismanagement. Here, international law, namely the Law of the Sea, provides the foundation for action that should be based firmly in science. Iceland will continue to share its expertise in these fields through our development cooperation, public-private partnerships and our capacity-building programs, run under the auspices of UNESCO.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nAs we embark on a Decade of Action, we need to be firmly focused on advancing gender equality - not only as a fundamental human right - but also as critical for accelerated progress so that individuals and nations can prosper and reach their full potential. The slow progress on Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality is therefore deeply worrying, not least as we risk losing a generation or more of gains due to the current crisis.\n\n\n\nWe must act now to ensure the full and equal participation of women in economic and political life, access to education, essential health services, and fight against sexual and gender-based violence. Iceland is therefore committed to contributing in a meaningful way as a co-leader of the Generation Equality Action Coalition on gender-based violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nGrowing nationalism, racism, religious intolerance, and homophobia will continue to undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms if we do not fight to reverse this trend. It is of major concern when the most powerful are ambivalent, even hostile, to the enjoyment of universal human rights by all. UN Members States must speak up and act when human rights are set aside or violated, and not hesitate to use the legal, economic, and political tools we have at our disposal.\n\n\n\nIn the past year, I have had the honour to meet many brave women and men who risk their life and freedom to call out their governments for violation of human rights and fundamental freedom. It is our duty to support and protect these human rights defenders and allow their voices to be heard. We must also protect media freedom, which has come under grave threat in too many countries around the world. Human rights underpin democratic and prosperous societies \u2013 which in turn are the fundamental basis for international stability and peace.\n\n\n\nAs a member of the UN Human Rights Council in 2018 and 2019, Iceland made an effort to demonstrate that all nations, also the smallest among us, can use their voice effectively to speak out for those suppressed or silenced. The experience was both encouraging and empowering, since most UN Member States belong to that group of smaller or mid-size countries.\n\n\n\nThe Human Rights Council is not without faults and shortcomings. We have been critical of the Council\u2019s membership, and the apparent desire by those with less than stellar human rights records to consistently undermine the integrity of the Council. We have also pushed for reform of the council and its working methods.\n\n\n\nMember States serving on the Council should never lose sight of its main mission and purpose \u2013 to protect and promote universal human rights. They should call out violators and hold them accountable and be open to constructive criticism and cooperation, rather than seek refuge behind rhetoric of politicization.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, and on the basis of the experience of our recent membership of the Human Rights Council, Iceland has decided to run for a seat on the Council for the term 2025-2027.\n\n\n\nMr President\n\n\n\nLet me thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in calling for a global ceasefire; a call which all nations should support, not least those that hold power to influence the situation on the ground.\n\n\n\nThe ongoing efforts to find political and peaceful solutions to the crisis in Syria, Yemen, and Libya must continue with full backing of those involved. The Middle East Peace Process also needs to be reinvigorated as the current stagnation on both sides only serves to deepen existing disagreements, moving us further away from the two-state solution.\n\n\n\nCloser to my own place of home, in Europe, the persistent unlawful violation by Russia of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia continues to undermine peace and stability, and recent developments in Belarus give cause for major concern.\n\n\n\nThe Security Council carries special responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security on behalf of the wider UN membership. The Council, not least some of its permanent members, need to act in accordance with the UN charter, instead of being motivated by narrow political gains in a zero-sum game, undermining the credibility of this vital body.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr President,\n\n\n\n\"The UN was not created to take mankind into paradise but rather to save humanity from hell\", former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld famously once said.\n\n\n\nAs we celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, we should be mindful that this organization has been a catalyst for human development and progress. And it is the most significant peace project of our times.\n\n\n\nThe UN remains the only international body equipped to bring together different nationalities, political ideologies, and religions, for the common good.\n\n\n\nIts shortcomings can neither serve as an excuse for disengagement nor for the promotion of national interests above the pursuit of our common wellbeing and prosperity.\n\n\n\nToo many seek to apply the principles and values of the UN Charter selectively, tilting the balance between rights and responsibilities \u2013 in international trade, rule of law, human rights, disarmament and in preventing conflicts and atrocities.\n\n\n\nOur organisations and institutions should never serve or shelter those who seek to undermine the basic principles of the international rule-based order, which we have all subscribed to, including the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n\n\nIt remains, that what we see is our own making. That is why, we need to use the current crisis and the 75th anniversary to reinvigorate our cooperation, build trust and make our institutions more effective and resilient, for today and tomorrow.\n\n\n\nWe should reconfirm our commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, international law, and the liberal international order.\n\n\n\nWe should stand up for these principles when they are being pushed aside.\n\n\n\nWe should make our institutions more open, transparent, and inclusive.\n\n\n\nWe should reform, not rewrite or retreat.\n\nFor only together we can build the future we want, and the UN we need.\n\nPre-recorded statement"}, {"url": "https://www.biographies.net/biography/gu%C3%B0laugur-%C3%9E%C3%B3r-%C3%9E%C3%B3r%C3%B0arson/m/03gsdp_", "page_content": "Who is Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson?\n\nGu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson is an Icelandic politician.

As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, we are continually editing, updating, and appending, articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. WorldHeritage.org is fully accessible on a tablet, smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, or any Internet-connected device with a Web browser.\n\nIs Print Obsolete?\n\n\"Thinking beyond the format\", Encyclopedias join a long list of paper we once thought we couldn't live without, like the Sears catalog, Yellow Pages and maps. Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions. Unlike many online encyclopedias, World Heritage Encyclopedia is an aggregation of professionally written, crowd sourced, peer reviewed, and edited articles, making our information the most reliable and complete encyclopedia. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic; new information can be presented almost immediately as it is happening in the world.

Mr. Gu\u00f0laugur \u00de\u00f3r \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson\n\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Development Cooperation of Iceland\n\nMr President, Excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen,\n\n\n\nLet me start by thanking the UN Secretary-General, for his leadership in these difficult times. I also express gratitude to the dedicated staff of this organization, often working in very challenging circumstances, for their commitment and courage.\n\n\n\nThe international community comes together for the 75th anniversary of the United Nations under exceptional circumstances - amid a global crisis.\n\n\n\nIceland is fully committed to support the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have contributed to the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, to the UN Response and Recovery Fund and to several other initiatives, including the development, distribution, and fair and equal access to a possible vaccine for every country.\n\n\n\nThis crisis will have long-term implications for our economies and societies, pushing millions of peoples further behind, not least the most vulnerable. We must, therefore, redouble our collective efforts and pursue the Sustainable Development Goals with vigour.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nThe pandemic has revealed that our fate is interlinked with the successes and failures of others. This very same revelation brought the founders of this great organisation together in 1945, after having lived through the horrors of two world wars. They understood then, as we must now, that we are stronger together than apart.\n\n\n\nThis notion is evident to a small state like Iceland, but larger states also gain from a well-functioning international rules-based order: peace, prosperity and partnerships for our people and planet. For the gravest challenges we face today can only be addressed collectively.\n\n\n\nThe current situation provides us with a perspective. Even if we still have a long way to go, we have witnessed significant achievements over the past 75 years. States have gained their independence, women have gained agency, more parents see their children grow up to become healthy adults, and millions have risen from poverty. Wild polio has recently been eradicated in Africa, a welcome sign of hope in the context of today\u2019s challenges. By most measures, we have been living in times of unprecedented prosperity, something we now know, should not be taken for granted.\n\n\n\nIt is critical that we fight to maintain and improve the multilateral system and oppose/question those who seek to undermine it. We must ensure that our institutions, actions and tools are fit for purpose \u2013 so that the system can continue to serve all of us. The Secretary-General's ongoing reform agenda has our full support.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nThe greatest challenge of our time can only be addressed through joint efforts. Climate action needs to be at the heart of our efforts as we build back better and greener after the pandemic. The Paris Agreement is the global baseline, and Iceland is fully committed to its implementation. To build back greener, we need to make full use of science, innovation, and positive financial stimulus for the full participation of the private sector.\n\n\n\nIceland's new climate action plan, released earlier this summer, goes even further than was agreed in Paris. Our goal is to achieve 35% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and full carbon neutrality by 2040.\n\n\n\nSustainable management of natural resources and the use of renewable energy will be instrumental if we are to combat climate change. That includes the sustainable use of our oceans, a major carbon sink, continuously threatened by climate change, pollution, and mismanagement. Here, international law, namely the Law of the Sea, provides the foundation for action that should be based firmly in science. Iceland will continue to share its expertise in these fields through our development cooperation, public-private partnerships and our capacity-building programs, run under the auspices of UNESCO.\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nAs we embark on a Decade of Action, we need to be firmly focused on advancing gender equality - not only as a fundamental human right - but also as critical for accelerated progress so that individuals and nations can prosper and reach their full potential. The slow progress on Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality is therefore deeply worrying, not least as we risk losing a generation or more of gains due to the current crisis.\n\n\n\nWe must act now to ensure the full and equal participation of women in economic and political life, access to education, essential health services, and fight against sexual and gender-based violence. Iceland is therefore committed to contributing in a meaningful way as a co-leader of the Generation Equality Action Coalition on gender-based violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. President,\n\n\n\nGrowing nationalism, racism, religious intolerance, and homophobia will continue to undermine human rights and fundamental freedoms if we do not fight to reverse this trend. It is of major concern when the most powerful are ambivalent, even hostile, to the enjoyment of universal human rights by all. UN Members States must speak up and act when human rights are set aside or violated, and not hesitate to use the legal, economic, and political tools we have at our disposal.\n\n\n\nIn the past year, I have had the honour to meet many brave women and men who risk their life and freedom to call out their governments for violation of human rights and fundamental freedom. It is our duty to support and protect these human rights defenders and allow their voices to be heard. We must also protect media freedom, which has come under grave threat in too many countries around the world. Human rights underpin democratic and prosperous societies \u2013 which in turn are the fundamental basis for international stability and peace.\n\n\n\nAs a member of the UN Human Rights Council in 2018 and 2019, Iceland made an effort to demonstrate that all nations, also the smallest among us, can use their voice effectively to speak out for those suppressed or silenced. The experience was both encouraging and empowering, since most UN Member States belong to that group of smaller or mid-size countries.\n\n\n\nThe Human Rights Council is not without faults and shortcomings. We have been critical of the Council\u2019s membership, and the apparent desire by those with less than stellar human rights records to consistently undermine the integrity of the Council. We have also pushed for reform of the council and its working methods.\n\n\n\nMember States serving on the Council should never lose sight of its main mission and purpose \u2013 to protect and promote universal human rights. They should call out violators and hold them accountable and be open to constructive criticism and cooperation, rather than seek refuge behind rhetoric of politicization.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, and on the basis of the experience of our recent membership of the Human Rights Council, Iceland has decided to run for a seat on the Council for the term 2025-2027.\n\n\n\nMr President\n\n\n\nLet me thank the Secretary-General for his leadership in calling for a global ceasefire; a call which all nations should support, not least those that hold power to influence the situation on the ground.\n\n\n\nThe ongoing efforts to find political and peaceful solutions to the crisis in Syria, Yemen, and Libya must continue with full backing of those involved. The Middle East Peace Process also needs to be reinvigorated as the current stagnation on both sides only serves to deepen existing disagreements, moving us further away from the two-state solution.\n\n\n\nCloser to my own place of home, in Europe, the persistent unlawful violation by Russia of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and Georgia continues to undermine peace and stability, and recent developments in Belarus give cause for major concern.\n\n\n\nThe Security Council carries special responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace and security on behalf of the wider UN membership. The Council, not least some of its permanent members, need to act in accordance with the UN charter, instead of being motivated by narrow political gains in a zero-sum game, undermining the credibility of this vital body.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr President,\n\n\n\n\"The UN was not created to take mankind into paradise but rather to save humanity from hell\", former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld famously once said.\n\n\n\nAs we celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations, we should be mindful that this organization has been a catalyst for human development and progress. And it is the most significant peace project of our times.\n\n\n\nThe UN remains the only international body equipped to bring together different nationalities, political ideologies, and religions, for the common good.\n\n\n\nIts shortcomings can neither serve as an excuse for disengagement nor for the promotion of national interests above the pursuit of our common wellbeing and prosperity.\n\n\n\nToo many seek to apply the principles and values of the UN Charter selectively, tilting the balance between rights and responsibilities \u2013 in international trade, rule of law, human rights, disarmament and in preventing conflicts and atrocities.\n\n\n\nOur organisations and institutions should never serve or shelter those who seek to undermine the basic principles of the international rule-based order, which we have all subscribed to, including the UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n\n\nIt remains, that what we see is our own making. That is why, we need to use the current crisis and the 75th anniversary to reinvigorate our cooperation, build trust and make our institutions more effective and resilient, for today and tomorrow.\n\n\n\nWe should reconfirm our commitment to the principles of the UN Charter, international law, and the liberal international order.\n\n\n\nWe should stand up for these principles when they are being pushed aside.\n\n\n\nWe should make our institutions more open, transparent, and inclusive.\n\n\n\nWe should reform, not rewrite or retreat.\n\nFor only together we can build the future we want, and the UN we need.\n\nPre-recorded statement"}, {"url": "https://www.norden.org/en/person/gudlaugur-thor-thordarson", "page_content": "Our Vision 2030 The Nordic region will become the most sustainable and integrated region in the world in 2030.\n\nPolicy areas Get insight into areas where the Nordic countries work together.\n\nCurrent initiatives Keep up with the latest Nordic initiatives and campaigns.\n\nInternational co-operation Get insight into the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers\u2019 international activities.\n\nNordic Council prizes The Literature Prize, the Children and Young People\u2019s Literature Prize, the Music Prize, the Film Prize, and the Environment Prize.\n\nNordic Council cases Here you can gain insight into current issues under consideration by the Nordic Council as well as look at closed cases."}, {"url": "https://www.norden.org/en/speech/67-gudlaugur-thor-thordarson-presentation", "page_content": "Forseti. \u00c9g \u00feakka \u00fe\u00e9r, Antti, fyrir fram\u00farskarandi formennsku \u00ed norr\u00e6na varnarsamstarfinu \u00ed \u00e1r og \u00f3ska \u00fe\u00e9r til hamingju me\u00f0 hana.

Jeg vil takke dig, Antti, for dit fremragende formandskab i det nordiske forsvarssamarbejde i \u00e5r, og jeg \u00f8nsker dig til lykke med det. Samarbejdet har v\u00e6ret et glimrende diskussionsforum om den aktuelle situation, og de n\u00e6ste skridt i det nordiske forsvars- og sikkerhedssamarbejde, med udgangspunkt i n\u00e6romr\u00e5derne s\u00e5vel som sikkerheds- og forsvarspolitik. Jeg er glad for at have et forum, hvor de nordiske lande kan udveksle synspunkter om de forsvarspolitiske udfordringer, vi st\u00e5r over for. Alle nordiske lande st\u00e5r for tilsvarende sikkerhedstrusler, og vi har f\u00e6lles strategiske interesser, selvom de ikke altid antager de samme former. Vort samarbejde om at reagere p\u00e5 disse udfordringer m\u00e5 fortsat bygge p\u00e5 landenes egne styrkepositioner. Jeg har lyst til at n\u00e6vne tre strategiske udfordringer i denne forbindelse, som kr\u00e6ver vores opm\u00e6rksomhed for tiden.\n\nDen f\u00f8rste er Ruslands disruptive adf\u00e6rd, brud p\u00e5 international lov samt hybride aktiviteter, der fortsat undergraver den internationale orden, baseret p\u00e5 folkeretten. NATO viser standhaftighed i alliancens tostrengede tilgang til Rusland, men Rusland er tydeligvis ikke interesseret i at indg\u00e5 en dialog. Derfor er det en reel udfordring at f\u00e5 en dialog i stand. Vi m\u00e5 dog fortsat l\u00e6gge vores lod p\u00e5 v\u00e6gtsk\u00e5len for at dette kan blive en realitet, samtidigt med at vi st\u00e5r fast p\u00e5 vores principper. Ruslands st\u00f8tte til Lukasjenkos styre har bidraget til \u00f8get ustabilitet i NATOs \u00f8stlige regioner. Vi st\u00e5r sammen med vores allierede, Polen, Litauen og Letland, som st\u00e5r over for, at Belarus anvender mennesker i landets hybride aktioner mod deres naboer.\n\nDen anden udfordring er Kina, der ikke deler vores demokratiske v\u00e6rdier, der s\u00f8ger at tilpasse den internationale orden til sine egne interesser, er en voksende sikkerhedspolitisk udfordring for Europa og i en bredere sammenh\u00e6ng, hvilket ungdommens repr\u00e6sentant gennemgik p\u00e5 en forbilledlig vis her i plenum. Vi m\u00e5 str\u00e6be os p\u00e5 at styrke samarbejdet, vi m\u00e5 styrke og profilere vores v\u00e6rdier, styrke vores resiliens, st\u00e5 vagt om den b\u00e6rende infrastruktur og bevare vores teknologiske forspring.\n\nDen tredje udfordring er klima\u00e6ndringernes dybtg\u00e5ende konsekvenser for fred og sikkerhed i hele verden. Norden kan spille en vigtig rolle med henblik p\u00e5 at skabe \u00f8get forst\u00e5else og h\u00e5ndtere klima\u00e6ndringerne som en tydelig og udslagsgivende sikkerhedstrussel."}, {"url": "http://cn.worldheritage.org/articles/Gu%C3%B0laugur_%C3%9E%C3%B3r_%C3%9E%C3%B3r%C3%B0arson", "page_content": "World Heritage Encyclopedia\n\nThe World Heritage Encyclopedia is the largest and most comprehensive Encyclopedia ever compiled.

As French philosopher, and contributor of the Encyclopedie Denis Diderot, said \"Indeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race. \"\n\nAccessibility World Heritage Encyclopedia, (WorldHeritage.org) is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, we are continually editing, updating, and appending, articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. WorldHeritage.org is fully accessible on a tablet, smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, or any Internet-connected device with a Web browser.\n\nIs Print Obsolete?\n\n\"Thinking beyond the format\", Encyclopedias join a long list of paper we once thought we couldn't live without, like the Sears catalog, Yellow Pages and maps. Even the world famous Encyclopedia Britannica will no longer be printed after 244 years, the final edition costing almost $1400. Today, the modern encyclopedia is often in electronic form and much more affordable then the traditional paper versions. Unlike many online encyclopedias, World Heritage Encyclopedia is an aggregation of professionally written, crowd sourced, peer reviewed, and edited articles, making our information the most reliable and complete encyclopedia.

Jeg vil gerne takke dig, Pekka, for din dynamiske ageren under dit formandskab i samarbejdet mellem de nordiske udenrigsministre, og jeg \u00f8nsker dig tillykke med det. Det nordiske samarbejde er enest\u00e5ende, og som en gruppe stater har Norden en st\u00e6rk stemme p\u00e5 den internationale arena, hvilket giver landene en v\u00e6sentlig indflydelse i internationalt samarbejde.\n\nBj\u00f6rn Bjarnasons rapport, der udkom sidste \u00e5r, belyser et nyt kapitel i det nordiske samarbejde, hvor et samarbejde om sikkerheds- og udenrigspolitik i stigende grad skal tage h\u00f8jde for \u00e6ndringer i det sikkerhedspolitiske landskab og de udfordringer, vi st\u00e5r overfor i dag.\n\nKlima\u00e6ndringer og hybride trusler, s\u00e5som cyberangreb og misinformation, undergraver vore landes stabilitet, og intet land kan h\u00e5ndtere disse udfordringer p\u00e5 egen h\u00e5nd. Resultater kan kun skabes gennem et st\u00e6rkt samarbejde, og derfor er det vigtigt, at vi forener vores kr\u00e6fter og bygger videre p\u00e5 det st\u00e6rke fundament, som det nordiske samarbejde udg\u00f8r.\n\nVi har allerede et succesrigt samarbejde p\u00e5 mange af de omr\u00e5der, som rapporten ber\u00f8rer, men dette samarbejde kan styrkes yderligere p\u00e5 mange m\u00e5der. Vi kan yde mere p\u00e5 klimaomr\u00e5det, for eksempel med \u00f8get samr\u00e5d inden for havforskning og eksport af gr\u00f8nne l\u00f8sninger.\n\nUd over klimaet handler anbefalingerne om klimasikkerhed og udviklingssp\u00f8rgsm\u00e5l, pandemiberedskab, samarbejde inden for udenrigstjenesten og forskning p\u00e5 det udenrigspolitiske omr\u00e5de, blot for at n\u00e6vne nogle f\u00e5. Der er tale om vigtige emner, hvor det nordiske samarbejde kan vise sig at v\u00e6re v\u00e6rdifuldt, som erfaringerne fra de sidste syv \u00e5rtier har vist os. Vi m\u00e5 give klimaudfordringerne og det \u00e6ndrede sikkerhedspolitiske landskab vor fulde opm\u00e6rksomhed. Indsatser kr\u00e6ver at anbefalingerne bliver implementeret p\u00e5 h\u00f8jeste niveau inden for administrationen, b\u00e5de i fagministerier og udenrigsministerier, og de skal ogs\u00e5 integreres i vores samarbejde med internationale organisationer og andre stater.\n\nFN's klimakonference, COP26, er nu i gang. Der stilles h\u00f8je forventningerne til dennes udfald, og alle verdens lande opfordres til at sk\u00e6rpe deres ambitionsniveau i klimaindsatsen. Der er ogs\u00e5 tegn p\u00e5 nye prioriteringer i Nordisk Ministerr\u00e5ds virksomhed og i det nordiske samarbejde generelt. Bjarnason-rapporten er et vigtigt redskab i denne sammenh\u00e6ng, og afslutningsvis vil jeg gerne understrege rapportens betydning for det nordiske samarbejde. Vi har ingen tid at miste."}, {"url": "https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gu%C3%B0laugur_%C3%9E%C3%B3r_%C3%9E%C3%B3r%C3%B0arson_(19-07-2021).jpg", "page_content": "attribution to the specified copyright holder.\n\nNote that if the copyright holder is not the European Commission or its predecessors (such as the CEC) the material may not be released under this license.\n\nSee also Template:PD-European-Commission and Commons:Village pump/Copyright/Archive/2019/04#Stills from the European Union.
