It is not the first time.\n\nIn 2016, then Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP Tathagata Satpathy moved a Private Member\u2019s Bill in the Lok Sabha to decriminalise defamation \u2014 the Protection of Speech and Reputation Bill (commonly known as the \u201cSpeech Bill\u201d). Satpathy, who is now the editor of Odia daily Dharitri, speaks to The Indian Express about what prompted him to introduce the Bill, its features, the response of other parties, and the effect criminal defamation has in today\u2019s political climate. Excerpts:\n\nAs an editor, I had about 87 defamation cases filed against me. In Odisha, you have a law that women don\u2019t have to deposit money if they want to file a defamation case. Normally, if you want to file a defamation case you have to deposit a certain percentage of what you claim in court. What happens if you level an allegation or publish a story against the police officials and bureaucrats in the newspapers is that they will get their wives or mothers or sisters to file a case against you. Even if you have enough evidence against them, they will file. Eventually, you will get cleared \u2014 in my case, I won all the cases if not in the lower court, then in the higher court. But it\u2019s harassment.\n\nSo, partly, my Bill was driven by my personal experiences. Because two proceedings, civil and criminal, for the same offence do not seem justified to me. If you look at the global picture, the criminal aspect of the defamation case is not there in any democratic country. The last one I know that had it was Australia but they also removed it a few years ago. In most countries, it\u2019s only the civil part. My simple counter was how can we prosecute twice for the same offence?\n\nI sought the help of lawyers and others, including journalists. Apar Gupta was one of the lawyers who played a key role in drafting that Bill. I may have read the Bill at least 100 times before I went ahead with it. Apar then suggested it would be good if we could put it up for public review, which we did. We had a website \u2014 speechbill.in \u2014 and sought people\u2019s views also. We received a lot of feedback.\n\nWhat were the features of the Bill?\n\nThe main feature of the Bill was that it decriminalised defamation and treated it as a civil offence. It had provisions to curb the chilling effects of criminal defamation and had provisions to prevent damage to reputations. It had quantification of damages for defamation, fixed the maximum amount of damages, and barred governments and institutions exercising government or statutory functions from filing defamation suits.\n\nHow relevant is it in the wake of recent political events?\n\nI did not foresee such an event. I always thought that it is very wrong. Today, everyone seems to have woken up. At the time, the Congress did not support my Bill, no one backed me. But, I wanted to put it on record for posterity at least. I would not say it was a watertight Bill. It needed improvement. But I would like MPs to take it up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeing an editor, and an active politician not so long ago, what do you think of the position that the right to reputation is no less important a right than the right to freedom of speech?\n\nRight to reputation is a debatable point and that can never ever infringe on freedom of speech or freedom of expression. A statement or a post or a tweet can be said to be hurting someone\u2019s sense and sensibilities. We are seeing it across the country. Then, it is up to them, not to the defendant, to prove how their reputation has been hurt. It\u2019s in the legal process also that during the cross-examination the complainant has to prove how \u2026 but all they can do is to find one or two witnesses in their neighbourhood to say \u2018yes, we thought bad of her or him because of the remark\u2019.\n\nThere are instances of people in power using the defamation law. Do you think it is being used to silence people?\n\nYes, people in power become super touchy. Some people say vulgar things but defend those by claiming freedom of speech. When someone calls me leftist or presstitute or sickular, I get offended. I am very badly hurt because I do not consider myself as someone selling his pen, I consider myself to be neither secular nor Leftist. Yes, I consider myself a liberal, I agree. I was in the House (Lok Sabha) when a Minister of State uttered the word \u2018Presstitute\u2019 on the floor of the House. As an editor and a working journalist, I was hurt. We knew that nothing will come of it. Yes, the same people use defamation clauses against others.\n\nAnother thing is that our lower judiciary is not trained to handle so many issues that come up with something like defamation. They are not normal criminal cases but are hypothetical ones. Our lower judiciary is not equipped to handle them. We talk of judicial reforms and the law minister is constantly talking against the collegium. But they are talking about the Supreme Court that they are dealing with every day. But the common Indian does not get to reach the Supreme Court. They are penalised, prosecuted, sentenced, jailed, given life terms, and the appeals take years. Some die in prisons. I would say 99 per cent of our population even. The high courts seem very high. People can afford to go to only the lower courts. I do not think the lower courts can sit in judgment on such delicate issues.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave you come across instances of defamation clauses being used against political rivals?\n\nI have never experienced (it), at least not in Odisha. But, of course, it comes up against the media. Of late, it has been happening. They are managing to corner opponents that way. The number of defamation cases was much lower 15-20 years back. Either people were gentler or they were not so touchy. If you start taking one line out of a speech, it can work any which way.\n\nYou are an editor. Does the new trend make you think twice before criticising someone powerful even if it\u2019s based on fact? Do you think there is increasing fear among citizens about criticising someone or exposing corruption?\n\nYes, people across India today are much more careful about what they say, especially about politics and politicians. Also about big business. All the powerful people.\n\nYou too?\n\nI am a don\u2019t-care-a-hoot kind of person but I refrain from being abusive. I speak what I like and also write what I think is correct. Also, must admit I have personally not felt fear or threatened, as yet."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/tathagata-satapathy/", "page_content": "Tathagata Satpathy (born 1 April 1956) was a member of the 12th , 14th, 15th and 16th Lok Sabha of India. He represented the Dhenkanal constituency of Odisha, and was re-elected for the fourth time in 2014. He was a member of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) political party, and the party's chief whip in the Lok Sabha. He took voluntary retirement from politics in March 2019. He is not an active politician ever since.\n\nLife and work\n\nTathagata Satpathy is the younger son of former Odisha Chief Minister Nandini Satpathy and Devendra Satpathy. He is the owner and editor of the daily Odia newspaper, Dharitri, and the English daily, Orissa Post.\n\nIn 2000, Satpathy joined the Orissa Gana Parishad ( a non political outfit), and served as its secretary general. After Naveen Patnaik got elected in 2000, Satpathy had used his newspaper Dharitri to criticise his policies which he does even now. In March 2004, just before the 2004 Indian general election, Satpathy reconciled with BJD. He said that he was forced to quit OGP due its changing into a political party as also forming an alliance with Janaki Ballabh Patnaik-led Indian National Congress (INC).\n\nHis nephew Suparno Satpathy had unsuccessfully contested him in 2014 for the office of MP Lok Sabha, Dhenkanal.\n\nIn March 2015, Tathagata Satpathy became the first Indian Member of Parliament to hold an official \"Ask Me Anything\" session on the content-sharing website Reddit. In April, Satpathy came forward in support of net neutrality, after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) come out with a consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services. In December 2015, Satpathy had supported a bill to decriminalise homosexuality. The bill was introduced by INC leader Shashi Tharoor. But, it was defeated with 71 against, 1 abstaining and 24 in favour.\n\nViews and opinions\n\nOn net neutrality\n\nIn March 2014, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) released a formal consultation paper on over-the-top (OTT) messaging services and whether telecom operators should be allowed to charge separately for some messaging apps. Soon afterwards, Tathagata Satpathy wrote an open letter to TRAI stating his support for net neutrality. In the letter, he said such a policy would hinder the Digital India project and kill new startups. He said that he used such apps to interact with his constituency and this policy will hinder his functioning as a representative.\n\nOn legalisation of cannabis\n\nTathagata Satpathy has criticised the ban on cannabis in India, while pointing out the long history of its usage as a ritual and recreational intoxicant. He has said that cannabis was banned in India while alcohol was not, because of \"an elitist bias\" as cannabis was a poor man's drug. He has said the addiction depends on person's character and not on the intoxicant. He has suggested an amendment to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 to allow recreational and medicinal usage of marijuana. During his \"Ask Me Anything\" session on Reddit in March 2015, Satpathy admitted that he smoked cannabis when he was young. In August 2015, during the monsoon session of the Parliament, he proposed the decriminalisation of cannabis. In December 2015, he repeated his proposal during the winter session, saying that banning cannabis has forced villagers to turn to alcohol.\n\nOn homosexuality and moral policing\n\nTathagata Satpathy has condemned the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises homosexuality in India, calling it \"archaic\" and called for its repeal. He had supported a bill introduced by INC MP Shashi Tharoor to decriminalise homosexuality during the 2015 winter session of the Parliament. When the bill was defeated, Satpathy called it a very sad day. Satpathy has also condemned moral policing and called for a repeal of laws banning pornography in India.\n\nOn privacy and Aadhaar\n\nTathagata Satpathy has raised concerns that the Aadhaar project could be used for mass surveillance or ethnic cleansing in the future. He has questioned why a new identity card project was created despite having several identity cards systems. He has also criticised the decision to present the Aadhaar Bill, 2016 as a money bill. He pointed out that although the bill allows the sharing of biometric under circumstances of national security, there was no concrete definition of national security included in the bill.\n\nOn religious laws and missionaries\n\nSatpathy supports the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code in India. He has criticised those current laws which are based on various religions, saying that the world is moving beyond religious scriptures and such laws only divide the society. He has also said that a lot of faith-based foreign aid comes to Odisha through missionaries. They offer the poor Dalits free education and jobs, this results in mass conversions to Christianity. Satpathy has said that politicians should use the dictionary definition of secularism to avoid confusion.\n\nOther opinions\n\nSatpathy has supported the inclusion of Members of Parliament under the Jan Lokpal Bill to curb corruption. In December 2015, he criticised the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Bill, 2015 during a debate, saying that the government was favouring big corporations with such laws. He has also criticised the Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana calling it flawed and that it looks good only on paper. He said it forces him to choose only 8 villages from his constituency for development out of 3000. Satpathy has opposed the proposal to make Hindi the national language.\n\nSatpathy has criticised the construction of new nuclear power plants in India, claiming that most of the world was now moving away from nuclear energy. He has also claimed that Areva nuclear firm of France sold outdated technology to Maharashtra. He has also said that the centre should release the data regarding the safety of nuclear power plants as they are in other countries."}, {"url": "https://www.thehindu.com/elections/results/lok-sabha-elections-2014-results-live-updates/article6012350.ece", "page_content": "May 16, 2014 07:33 am | Updated December 04, 2021 10:47 pm IST\n\n>Lok Sabha Elections 2014 Results: Final party position\n\n>Infographic: Lok Sabha 2014 \u2014 Party-wise vote share\n\nALL INDIA Result Status\n\nStatus Known For 543 out of 543 Constituencies\n\nParty Won Leading Total\n\nBharatiya Janata Party 219 63 282\n\nCommunist Party of India 1 0 1\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) 4 5 9\n\nIndian National Congress 34 10 44\n\nNationalist Congress Party 5 1 6\n\nAam Aadmi Party 4 0 4\n\nAll India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam 15 22 37\n\nAll India N.R.

In 1998, Uttar Pradesh had 85 seats of which five have gone to Uttarakhand after division.\n\nLed by a whirlwind campaign by its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, the party improved its all time high vote share of 36.49 per cent taking it to over 42 per cent.\n\nA saving grace for BSP is that it remained runner-up on 33 seats.

About 814,500,000 people will have a ballot, and around 20% of these will be eligible for the first time. Turnout has traditionally been in the region of 55%.\n\nSo vast is the democratic exercise that it will require around 5 million people to conduct the procedure, and as many again to police it. The electoral commission has a stated ambition that no voter should have to travel more than 2km to a polling station, and nor should any one station serve more than 1,500 voters.\n\nThe election takes place in nine phases, over a period of six weeks. Voting starts in the remote hills and valleys of the far north-east before moving into central upland areas and then broadly shifting further west and south.\n\nSome of the medium-sized states hold polls in all constituencies on the same day, but the bigger states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh are spread over five or more days. Jammu and Kashmir, with six constituencies in total, takes five separate days, to allow the security forces to concentrate their efforts on one constituency at a time.\n\nSchedule\n\nDay 1 | 7 April | 6 constituencies Some seats in Assam and Tripura in the north-east.\n\nDay 2 | 9 April | 7 constituencies All of Arunachal Pradesh in the Himalayas, plus the other north-eastern states Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland and half of neighbouring Manipur.\n\n\n\nDay 3 | 10 April | 92 constituencies All of Chandigarh, Delhi, Kerala, and Haryana, plus seats in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, and the two seats in the island groups of Andaman, Nicobar and Lakshadweep.\n\n\n\nDay 4 | 12 April | 7 constituencies North-east again \u2013 more in Assam, plus all of Sikkim and the rest of Tripura \u2013 and Goa\u2019s two seats\n\n\n\nDay 5 | 17 April | 121 constituencies The biggest day. All of Karnataka in the south, plus the rest of Odisha. Most of Rajasthan and seats in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, plus remaining seat in Manipur.\n\n\n\nDay 6 | 24 April | 117 constituencies The second biggest day. All of Tamil Nadu, and seats in Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, plus the rest of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and the single seat in Pondicherry.\n\n\n\nDay 7 | 30 April | 89 constituencies All of Modi\u2019s powerbase state of Gujarat, plus all of Punjab, a large part of Andhra Pradesh, and more seats in Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and the two seats in Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu.\n\n\n\nDay 8 | 7 May | 64 constituencies The rest of Andhra Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, all of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and 15 seats in Uttar Pradesh, plus more in Bihar and West Bengal.\n\n\n\nDay 9 | 12 May | 41 constituencies Not an anticlimax. The biggest day in two of the most populous states: West Bengal, with its remaining 17 seats voting, and Uttar Pradesh with 18, along with the last seats in Bihar.\n\n\n\nAll of this activity is to return the 543 elected members of the Lok Sabha, India\u2019s more powerful lower house. Each MP serves a geographical constituency, and is elected using the first past the post system. The size of the constituencies varies substantially, partly because some of the seats are reserved for \u201cscheduled castes\u201d or \u201cscheduled tribes\u201d. The Lok Sabha also has two seats reserved for the Anglo-Indian community; the holders of these seats are appointed by the president.\n\nPolitical context\n\nCongress, which has led a coalition government since 2004, is the equivalent of the Grand Old Party of India, having been in power for all but 13 of the 67 years since independence. But hit by a faltering economy, corruption scandals and runaway inflation, Congress is now at a low ebb.\n\nTogether the coalition and its non-allied supporters had 276 seats, or a majority of nine. There is no guarantee that its coalition partners will work with it after the poll. Nor that its key \u201cvote banks\u201d \u2013 Muslims and those at the bottom of the caste system, India\u2019s tenacious social hierarchy \u2013 will provide the numbers needed for a third term.\n\n\n\nThe BJP, meanwhile, is seen as the party of the urban middle classes, increasingly numerous as Indians move from the countryside to the cities, and as they become more prosperous. Some analysts describe the battle as pitting older ideas of class or community against new mass aspirations; others see battles between different ideas of India; still more talk of the regions. As ever in India, nothing is simple.\n\nBut after two terms in power since 2004, Congress\u2019s current hold on the Lok Sabha is tenuous. They rule in coalition with several minor parties, including the Muslim League, but with the non-allied support of two major parties, the Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj party. Both of those are rivals to Congress among the rural population of the Indus-Ganges plain, its heartland. Together the Congress coalition and its non-allied supporters had 276 seats, or a majority of nine. There is no guarantee that its coalition partners will work with it after the poll.\n\nThe BJP, meanwhile, is seen as the party of the urban middle class, a group that has grown as Indians move from the countryside to the cities, and as the cities become more prosperous.\n\nKey players\n\nModi makes no secret of his desire for power, or his Hindu nationalist views, and is seen as divisive by some. From a poor family, of a caste at the bottom of India\u2019s tenacious social hierarchy, he was born, almost literally, on the wrong side of the tracks and helped his father sell tea as a child to train passengers stopping at the station in his provincial hometown in the western state of Gujarat. He was an unexceptional student at his government school, though opinionated and rebellious.\n\nPart of the RSS, the huge conservative national volunteer force, by his early teens, Modi showed himself to be an effective organiser and rose quickly in the movement. He moved across to the BJP, an ideological offshoot of the RSS though organisationally distinct, and worked his way up the ranks of the political party. In 2001 he was tapped to replace the then BJP chief minister, the top elected official, of Gujarat. He went on to win three successive elections before being launched on the national stage as the BJP prime ministerial candidate last year.\n\nCritics see him as an extremist who, in 2002, allegedly allowed or encouraged mobs to attack Muslims in towns across Gujarat after a lethal fire supposedly started by Muslims on a train full of Hindu pilgrims.\n\nModi denied the allegations and investigators have cleared him of any direct involvement in the violence, but his reputation still concerns many, particularly among India\u2019s large Muslim population.\n\nOthers, including some of the most powerful industrialists in India, say Modi is an honest and decisive administrator who has introduced policies that have encouraged development in his state and could be reproduced across the nation if he were prime minister.\n\nRahul Gandhi, Congress\n\nRahul Gandhi\u2019s great-grandfather was Jawaharlal Nehru, the independence leader and India\u2019s first prime minister; his grandmother was Indira Gandhi, a four-term prime minister, and his father Rajiv was assassinated while seeking re-election in 1991. His mother, Italian-born Sonia, is chair of the ruling coalition and president of the Congress party.\n\nBut what is less clear is the ability of the largely untested Gandhi to govern a chaotic country of 1.2 billion people that faces great challenges. He has no ministerial experience, nor any at state level.\n\nGandhi grew up in great privilege and was tutored at home with his sister Priyanka. He studied at Harvard and Cambridge, earning a masters in Development Studies, and worked for a short time as a management consultant.\n\nHe entered politics in 2004, the year the Congress party returned to power, and was elected to the parliamentary seat of Amethi, a family bastion once held by his father. In 2007 he was appointed to several senior positions within the party and launched a series of internal reforms designed to make the organisation more transparent, meritocratic and democratic. Last year he was made vice president \u2013 junior only to his mother \u2013 and has led the campaign in the 2014 elections despite not having been formally declared as a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nGandhi, who is unmarried, is reclusive and rarely speaks to the media. In a rare recent interview, he said he had never sought power and opposed dynasty in politics. He wants to empower women in India and young people, as well as make India \u201cthe centre of manufacturing in the world\u201d.\n\nArvind Kejriwal, Aam Admi party\n\nKejriwal first gained public attention during the India-wide agitation against corruption three years ago. He founded his political party, the Aam Admi (Common Man) party or AAP in the wake of that campaign, with a basic aim of fighting graft, bringing better governance and cleaning up the murky and opaque world of Indian politics. Last year the AAP surprised observers and won enough seats in Delhi to briefly hold power.\n\nCritics said Kejriwal\u2019s tenure as chief minister of the capital proved that, though a highly effective mobiliser and protester, the qualified engineer was less successful as an administrator and temperamentally unsuited to making the many compromises necessary to run a country as complicated as India. They also attacked measures such as increasing subsidies of water supply as populist.\n\nSupporters simply said that, unlike most other local politicians, Kejriwal was committed to principles, not simply power, and maintained that gestures such as refusing the security cover, luxury accommodation and red vehicle siren that top Indian bureaucrats, military officers and politicians force traffic aside sent a powerful message.\n\nMarried with two children, Kejriwal is the son of a minor bureaucrat who grew up in smalltown northern India. He appeals to many Indians of a similar background frustrated by the failure of the state to provide basic services such as education, security and power. However, if on issues such as campaign funding Kejriwal\u2019s stance is clear, his exact economic or social policies are less so. Most seem far from a clean break with the statist model that has dominated for so long.\n\nKejriwal passed some of India\u2019s toughest public examinations as a young man. Now he is standing for election from Varanasi, the Hindu holy city, against Narendra Modi, the BJP prime ministerial candidate. Supporters say this is a gauge of his courage. Critics say it shows his hubris.\n\nOther parties\n\nIn Uttar Pradesh, the state which sends most MPs to parliament, the Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj parties are both relatively weak but could still have a role to play. Elsewhere, West Bengal is the powerbase of the Trinamool Congress, led by the fiesty Mamata Banerjee, and, in southern Tamil Nadu, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam of Jayalalithaa Jayaram.\n\n\n\nBoth could end up as kingmakers. Shiv Sena are close BJP allies in Mumbai. The Communists look set to be reduced to a record low. As for the new Aam Admi party, no one really knows.\n\nKey battles and battlegrounds\n\nIndia\u2019s election is far from a two-horse race. Taking the 2009 results of the six most populous states \u2013 together accounting for over half of the Lok Sabha \u2013 we can see different battles everywhere with much local variation. The toughest fights for the main two parties will be in Uttar Pradesh, Andhara Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra. Congress should do well in Karnataka, relative to the predicted debacle elsewhere.\n\nNot surprisingly for such a mammoth exercise in democracy, the electoral maths is tricky to compute, with so many different races in different regions and a psephological map that is anything but uniform. But modelling a generalised swing to the BJP, taking votes proportionally from the other parties, we see that Modi\u2019s party would overtake Congress relatively quickly, but struggle to get anything like an overall majority.\n\n\n\nWhat happens next then depends greatly on what deals can be cut with coalition partners.\n\nNot surprisingly for such a mammoth exercise in democracy, the electoral maths is tricky to compute, with so many different races in different regions and a psephological map that is anything but uniform.

But what are the possible outcomes for India\u2019s government? Analysts predict six broad variants.\n\n\n\nNow read on\n\nYou can follow the Guardian\u2019s latest coverage of the Indian election here."}, {"url": "https://tathagatasatpathy.com/site/Biography", "page_content": "Biography :\n\nCurriculum Vitae\n\nTathagata Satpathy\n\nDOB: April 01, 1956 at Cuttack, Orissa, India\n\nEducation\n\nEducated at Sri Aurobindo Center of Education, Pondicherry, South India.\n\nSubjects studied English, Philosophy and French\n\nCan speak English, Oriya, Hindi, French\n\nOccupation\n\nJournalism & Publishing Editor Dharitri, published from Bhubaneswar and Sambalpur\n\nDharitri is the first Oriya daily to have an online presence.\n\nThe newspaper is 16 paged with a reach of 12,50,000 readers and has local, national and international news along with views that promote thoughts of a free and liberal world order\n\nElected Representative\n\nHas been a Member of:\n\nOrissa Legislative Assembly (1990-95)\n\nOrissa Legislative Assembly (1990-95) 12th Lok Sabha (1998-99)\n\n(1998-99) 14th Lok Sabha (2004-09)\n\n(2004-09) 15th Lok Sabha (2009-14)\n\n(2009-14) 16th Lok Sabha (2014-present)\n\n(2014-present) Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology\n\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Coal & Steel\n\nParliamentary Standing Committee on Privileges\n\nOther positions held\n\nMember of Marine Product Export Development Authority, India (MPEDA)\n\nPresident of Chacrateertha Bikash Parishad, Puri, Orissa: an organization focused on creating public awareness on the importance of environment protection and waste management\n\nWorking President Akhshyam Kalyan Samiti, Dhenkanal, Orissa: a voluntary organization aiding poor physically challenged children.

To commemorate that monumental exercise, The Wire is publishing a series of articles exploring various aspects of the first ever general election in independent India. Read it here.\n\nIndia\u2019s first general election, which took place between October 25, 1951 and February 21, 1952, was a colossal exercise; one-sixth of the world\u2019s population was going to vote in one election.\n\nWith the introduction of universal adult suffrage, the election saw the largest share of the Indian populace vote at the same time.\n\nAccording to India\u2019s 23rd Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora\u2019s foreword to the reprint of the ECI\u2019s report on the first general election, no more than 14% of the Indian population had ever voted at the same time in the provincial elections held pre-independence. In the 1951-1952 elections, the electorate was around 173 million.\n\nThe elections were organised by the first CEC of India, Sukumar Sen, to replace the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Constituent Assembly, which served as the Parliament until the first elected government took charge.\n\nA total of 489 Lok Sabha seats were contested in the election from 401 constituencies, since some had more than one seat assigned to them. While the elections officially took eight months, reports say that the majority of the population that voted (voter turnout was around 45%) did so only in 1952.\n\nWhile Nehru and the Congress enjoyed a landslide victory, winning more seats than all opposition parties combined (not to mention almost 45% of all votes), it is still worth examining these varied opposition parties and the political undercurrents they represented then, to better understand how these inclinations went on to present themselves in the country\u2019s political landscape in the future.\n\nA total of 53 political parties contested the first election, of which 14 were considered \u2018national parties\u2019 while the rest were considered \u2018state\u2019 parties. Apart from not having a consistent electoral symbol across the country (which was a significant concern, given the low literacy levels at the time), there were no further restrictions, so to speak, on the state parties.\n\nNotable state parties included the Shiromani Akali Dal in Punjab, which managed to win four Lok Sabha seats, as well as the All India Ganatantra Parishad in Maharashtra, which won eight. However, this article focuses on the 14 national parties; their key leaders, their values, their performance in the 1952 elections and where (if anywhere) they currently stand.\n\nThe Indian National Congress (INC): The Congress was the clear front-runner in India\u2019s first general election, boasting many prominent names from the country\u2019s freedom struggle.\n\nThe party sailed to victory, winning 364 of the 479 seats that it contested, more than the total number of seats won by all other parties put together and leaving the runner-up Communist Party of India (CPI), which secured only 16 seats, in the dust.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country, contested for the Congress from the Allahabad East cum Jaunpur West District constituency as it was then known, renamed to Phulpur in subsequent years.\n\nApart from Nehru, other prominent Congress leaders included Abul Kalam Azad, who contested from the Rampur District cum Bareilly District (West) constituency and became India\u2019s first minister of education, national resources and scientific research and Gulzarilal Nanda, India\u2019s first minister of planning and river valley schemes, who later served as the country\u2019s interim Prime Minister twice; once after the death of Nehru and then again after the death of India\u2019s second Prime Minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri.\n\nThe Congress\u2019s dominion persisted for a long time after the first general election, winning 11 of the 14 elections until 2014, when the country\u2019s tide decisively turned in favour of the BJP.\n\nThe Congress of today is nowhere near as dominant, managing to secure only 52 seats in the most recent Lok Sabha elections held in 2019 compared to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party\u2019s (BJP) 303. What\u2019s more, only three of India\u2019s chief ministers currently belong to the Congress.\n\nCommunist Party of India (CPI): The CPI, as mentioned earlier, emerged as the runner up in India\u2019s first general election. Despite only winning 16 seats, the CPI formed the principal opposition in the country.\n\nThe party was officially formed in Kanpur (erstwhile Cawnpore) in 1925 after a decade of efforts from various groups to create a communist presence in the country. After its formation, however, the ruling British had outlawed communist activity throughout India and the party, which was forced to operate clandestinely, saw its work constrained until India gained independence.\n\nThe party stood for, among other things, social equality for women, universal adult suffrage, land reforms and for all privately-owned enterprises to be brought under the control of the government. The core demand of the party going into the first general election was for a \u201cnational democracy.\u201d\n\nThe party saw the greatest electoral success from Madras where eight of its candidates won seats, followed by West Bengal, where it won five seats, Tripura, where it won two and Orissa, where it won one.\n\nThe CPI formed the principal opposition in the next two Lok Sabha elections as well. However, in 1964, the Soviet and Chinese communist factions within the party split, giving rise to the CPI (Marxist).Thereafter, the new CPI(M) continued to secure more votes than the CPI in the country\u2019s general elections.\n\nToday, the CPI(M), with Sitaram Yachuri as its general secretary, is the more politically relevant of the two factions, being the party in power in Kerala with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the helm.\n\nAt the state level, both the CPI and the CPI(M) are part of the Secular Progressive Alliance government in Tamil Nadu. The CPI(M) also has a political presence in West Bengal, being part of the ruling Left Front Alliance until 2011, after which the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) has been in power.\n\nAt the national level, the CPI(M) has three MPs in the Lok Sabha (one from Kerala and two from Tamil Nadu) while the CPI has two (both from Tamil Nadu).\n\nSocialist Party (SOC): Following the CPI was Jayaprakash Narayan and Ram Manohar Lohiya\u2019s Socialist Party, which secured 12 seats of the 254 it contested in India\u2019s first general election.\n\nThe Socialist Party had its roots in the Congress Socialist Party, a left-wing faction within the Indian National Congress formed by Narayan, Lohiya and Acharya Narendra Dev which separated from the former shortly after independence.\n\nIdeological differences with Mahatma Gandhi as well as Nehru caused the party\u2019s rift with the Congress, however, Lohiya continued to abide by the Gandhian principle of Ahimsa even as Narayan was an advocate of a more militant approach. The party\u2019s guiding principle was one of decentralised socialism in which the role of the Union government would be more subdued and local authorities would hold more economic power in their hands.\n\nDespite Narayan\u2019s popularity on account of his role in India\u2019s freedom struggle, the Socialist Party\u2019s election haul was unimpressive and thus, after the election, it merged with J.B. Kripalani\u2019s Kisan Mazdoor Praja Party (KMPP) to form the Praja Socialist Party (PSP).\n\nA faction of the PSP led by Lohiya, in turn, broke from the PSP in 1955 and came to be known as the Samyukt Socialist Party or even just the Socialist Party, which eventually re-joined the PSP in 1972.\n\nAt the time, Narayan, too, stepped back from the PSP and only re-entered national politics once again in the mid-70s when he led the movement against Indira Gandhi, whose government he alleged was corrupt and undemocratic. Narayan subsequently led the calls for Gandhi\u2019s disqualification prior to her declaration of the Emergency in 1975, for which he was arrested.\n\nUpon being released from jail, Narayan and other PSP leaders joined hands with several other groups to form the Bharatiya Lok Dal which, following the Emergency in 1977, along with practically the entire opposition in the country, banded together to form the Janata Party to oppose the Gandhi-led Congress.\n\nSeveral parties including the BJP and the Samajwadi Party can trace their lineage back to the Janata Party.\n\nKisan Mazdoor Praja Party (KMPP): The Jivatram Bhagwandas \u2018Acharya\u2019 Kripalani-led KMPP was another Congress breakaway party and, after the INC and the Socialist Party, contested the third largest number of seats (145), but managed to win only nine of them.\n\nAmong the candidates the KMPP fielded were two former chief ministers \u2013 Prafulla Chandra Ghosh of West Bengal and Tanguturi Prakasam of Madras.\n\nKripalani was a Gandhian who featured prominently in the Civil Disobedience movement and subsequently, in the freedom struggle. He served as general-secretary of the Congress from 1934-1945 and was elected party president in 1946.\n\nKripalani had several ideological differences with Nehru and most of the Congress\u2019 senior leadership, with the exception of Mahatma Gandhi, and had revealed in his posthumous autobiography that he took strong objection to the partition of the country.\n\nIn 1947, Kripalani had resigned from the post as Congress president, but remained a part of independent India\u2019s interim government and was part of the Constituent Assembly. However, after he was unsuccessful in becoming party president in 1950, he resigned in 1951 to form the KMPP.\n\nInterestingly, Kripalani lost from the Faizabad District (North West) seat to Congress candidate Panna Lal but was subsequently elected to the Lok Sabha in a bye-election from the Bhagalpur constituency. His wife, Sucheta Kripalani, won from the New Delhi Lok Sabha seat.\n\nAfter the election, as mentioned above, Kripalani\u2019s KMPP joined hands with the Socialist Party to form the PSP. He was, once again elected as a PSP MP in 1957 before leaving the party in 1960. He subsequently won another general election as an independent and another as an MP of C. Rajgopalachari\u2019s Swatantra Party.\n\nKirpalani also emerged as a vehement critic of Indira Gandhi during the JP movement and was among the leaders that were jailed for opposing her, despite being over eighty years old. He, along with Narayan, was asked to select the leader of the Janata Dal government.\n\nAkhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha (HMS): While the HMS enjoy some support in pre-Independence India, the role of prominent leaders like Vinayak Damodar (\u2018Veer\u2019) Savarkar and member Nathuram Godse in the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948 drew widespread criticism and meant that the party secured only four seats in the first election.\n\nThe HMS was preceded by several regional Hindu sabhas which came together under the banner of the Sarvadeshak (All India) Hindu Sabha in 1915. In 1921, at the Sabha\u2019s sixth conference at the Haridwar Kumbh Mela, it adopted the name Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha.\n\nIn its early days, the Sabha had the support of prominent leaders like Madan Mohan Malviya and Lala Lajpat Rai. Even Gandhi had attended the meeting at the Kumbh Mela. However, in the 1920s, the party came under the leadership of Savarkar and the more stringent \u2018Hindutva\u2019 ideology began to take over, leading to a faction led by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar to break off and form the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which considered itself a non-political entity.\n\nIn the years that followed, the HMS became diametrically opposed to Gandhi and the Congress, abstaining from the Civil Disobedience movement, forming coalition governments with the Muslim League in several provinces and demanding the partition of the country. Under Savarkar\u2019s leadership, the party even refused to participate in the Quit India movement, choosing to stick to their posts within the British government.\n\nIn the aftermath of Partition, Savarkar blamed Gandhi\u2019s ideology of non-violence for the loss of life on the Hindu side and incited his party members against him, eventually leading to HMS member Godse assassinating Gandhi. After Gandhi\u2019s assassination, key leaders like Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, who had served in the ruling coalition in Bengal pre-independence and even in Nehru\u2019s first interim government, left the party to form the Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS).\n\nPolitically, the party never gained much favour in independent India, securing only one seat in the Lok Sabha since 1971. However, Savarkar\u2019s Hindutva underpinnings, the demand for a \u2018Hindu Rashtra\u2019 and the formulation that Muslims and Christians are \u2018outsiders\u2019 in India is now being seen in an aggressive way in Indian politics today.\n\nPresent party members continue with efforts to revive Savarkar and, controversially, even Godse and, despite not having much influence by way of votes, still has an ideological influence on Indian politics.\n\nAlso read: During the Quit India Movement, the Hindu Mahasabha Played the British Game\n\n\n\nAkhil Bharatiya Ram Rajya Parishad (RRP): Founded in 1948 by Hariharanand \u2018Swami\u2019 Karpatri, the RRP, as the name suggests, contested India\u2019s first election on the platform of Hindu revivalism and the demand for a Hindu Rashtra.\n\nThe party only managed to win three seats of the 61 it contested in the first election, however, it managed moderate success in subsequent Vidhan Sabha elections in the country\u2019s \u2018Hindi belt\u2019, particularly in Rajasthan.\n\nKarpatri had established the Dharma Sangh in 1940, which engaged in re-converting Hindus who had been converted to Islam.\n\nLike other Hindu nationalist parties at the time, the RRP had fought against Nehru and B.R. Ambedkar\u2019s implementation of the Hindu Code Bills which sought to abolish Hindu personal law in favour of a secular unified civil code, an exercise initiated by the British.\n\nThe party eventually merged into Shyama Prasad Mukherjee\u2019s BJS in 1971, ahead of the JP movement and the eventual unification of the Congress\u2019s opposition to form the Janata Party.\n\nReports also have it that Karpatri and the RRP were involved in the early days of the Ayodhya-Ram Mandir issue and had called for the demolition of the Babri Masjid at the site.\n\nIn 1949, after a local mazar near the Babri Masjid was demolished, Karpatri had reportedly played a key role in organising the nine-day Akhand Path (uninterrupted reading) of the Ramcharitramanas, following which some individuals broke into the Masjid and forcibly placed Ram idols within its bounds, kicking off the entire dispute.\n\nHowever, the lack of widespread support for the cause at the time, the fact that the land legally belonged to the Waqf board and Nehru and the Congress\u2019 intervention into the issue stopped it from featuring in the first Indian election.\n\nAlso read: Ayodhya: Once There Was A Mosque\n\nAll India Bharatiya Jan Sangh (BJS): Following Shyama Prasad Mukherjee\u2019s disagreements with Savarkar\u2019s ideology and subsequent exit from the Hindu Mahasabha, he went on to establish the BJS in collaboration with the RSS which, incidentally, was looking to make a foray into national politics.\n\nThe BJS was aligned with the RSS\u2019s Hindutva politics and managed to win three of the 49 seats it contested in the first election. Mukherjee himself won from the Calcutta South East constituency. Lal Krishna Advani, who was initially an RSS worker from Rajasthan, joined the BJS\u2019s Rajasthan unit as a secretary soon after it was formed.\n\nFollowing Mukherjee\u2019s death in 1953, RSS members slowly edged out the politicians from the party, transforming it more and more into its own political wing. The BJS then really made its presence felt, particularly in the country\u2019s Hindi belt, after the 1967 Lok Sabha election, winning 35 seats compared to the Congress lowest haul till that point of 283 seats.\n\nThe BJS, then led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee and L.K. Advani was thereafter an integral component of the Janata Party coalition which took on the Indira Gandhi-led Congress.\n\nHowever, infighting within the coalition after coming to power and the BJS\u2019s refusal to accept the demands of other coalition members to snap ties with the RSS eventually culminated in a no confidence motion and the dissolution of the Morarji Desai-led government in 1979.\n\nFollowing the dissolution, Vajpayee, Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi led a large number of BJS leaders into the formation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which retained the BJS\u2019s Hindutva ideology but added elements of \u2018Gandhian socialism\u2019 in subsequent years. However, it remained in the wilderness till Advani\u2019s Rath Yatra led to it becoming a challenge to the Congress\u2019 hegemony, eventually leading it to power in Delhi, initially in the late 1990s.\n\nThereafter, after the Narendra Modi-led BJP rose to power in 2014, the party has consolidated power to become the dominant political party in the country, attuned as ever to its Hindutva ideology, anti-Muslim electoral pegs and the issues which brought it success in the past, most notably, the destruction of the Babri Masjid in December, 1992 and the agitation for the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, as well as the anti-Muslim violence in Gujarat in 2002\n\nRevolutionary Socialist Party (RSP): The RSP was formed in 1940 by Tridib Chaudhuri and emerged from the Bengali Anushilan Samiti, an organisation that advocated revolutionary violence to overthrow the colonial government.\n\nAhead of the first election, the RSP had negotiated an agreement with the United Socialist Organisation of India (USOI), a socialist coalition which agreed to support the RSP in two Lok Sabha seats but contest against them in others. The RSP ended up winning three seats, with leader Chaudhuri winning from Bengal\u2019s Berhampore constituency.\n\nA section of Anushilan Marxists had broken from the group in the 1930s and went on to eventually form the CPI. Anushilan Samiti members, however, refused to stand with the CPI in its opposition to the Congress and Gandhi and eventually joined the Congress Socialist Party (CSP) out of necessity, however, maintaining their own identity within it.\n\nWhen a fierce contest emerged in 1939 between Subhas Chandra Bose (who believed that the prospect of another world war should be used to attack the British and gain independence) and Gandhi\u2019s faction within the Congress, the Anushilan Samiti clearly supported Bose.\n\nThereafter, when Bose broke from the Congress to form the Forward Bloc, he attempted to recruit the Anushilan Samiti members within his Left Consolidation Committee, also including the CPI, CSP and other left parties. However, when this committee fell apart and most left parties abandoned it, the Anushilan Samiti members, too, struck out on their own to form the RSP, cutting ties with the CSP.\n\nMoreover, after the Kerala Socialist Party split in 1949, a section of its leaders joined hands with the RSP and set up a branch in the state.\n\nThe RSP went through several splits in subsequent years. After a split in Kerala in 2002, some members of the party led by regional chief Baby John broke away to form the RSP (Bolshevik). However, after the party left the LDF in March 2014, it once again merged with the RSP (B) in the same year.\n\nLater still, Kovoor Kunjumon led a faction away from the party to form the RSP (Leninist) which was faced with another split when party leader Ambathala Sreedharan Nair claimed that it was he and not Kunjumon who was the party\u2019s general secretary.\n\nCurrently, the RSP\u2019s seat of power is in West Bengal, having three MLAs in the state assembly. In Kerala, the RSP is part of the United Democratic Front (UDF) alliance while the RSP (L) is part of the LDF.\n\nAll India Scheduled Castes\u2019 Federation (SCF): The SCF was founded by B.R. Ambedkar in 1942 and, following from his work against caste and capitalist structures in India with the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and the Depressed Classes Federation (DCF), the party worked for the rights of Dalits in India.\n\nSivaraj was elected as the party president and P.N. Rajbhoj was elected the general secretary.\n\nThe SCF didn\u2019t see much success in the 1952 election, securing only two of the 35 seats it contested. Interestingly, Ambedkar himself lost the election from the Bombay City North constituency to the Congress candidate Narayan Kajrolkar, who was once Ambedkar\u2019s subordinate.\n\nLater, however, Ambedkar became a member of the Rajya Sabha but when he tried to get elected to the Lok Sabha again in the 1954 bypolls in Bhandara, he was defeated by another Congress candidate.\n\nThe SCF was succeeded by the Republican Party of India (RPI) which Ambedkar attempted to establish in 1956, However, he passed away before the party could be formed and thereafter, his followers officially formed the party on October 1, 1957. Sivaraj was among those present, as were Bhimrao Ambedkar\u2019s son Yashwantrao \u2018Bhaiyasaheb\u2019 Ambedkar and Damodar Tatyaba \u2018Dadasaheb\u2019 Rupwate.\n\nThe RPI won nine seats in the second Lok Sabha elections in 1957. However, in subsequent years, the party saw inordinate splits, each of them claiming the name of the RPI. Thereafter, in 2009, all these factions came together to unite as the Republican Party of India (United), with the exception of the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, a party founded in 1994 by B.R Ambedkar\u2019s grandson, Prakash Yashwant \u2018Balasaheb\u2019 Ambedkar.\n\nLater, two more factions from within the RPI (U) led by R.S. Gavai and Ramdas Athawale broke off to form the RPI (Gavai) and RPI (A) respectively.\n\nThe RPI (U) is currently part of the Republican Left Democratic Front (RLDF) in Maharashtra while the RPI (Gavai), which was once a part of the UPA government, is also limited to Maharashtra. Athawale is currently the Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment in the BJP government.\n\nMoreover, Kanshi Ram, the founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was once a member of the RPI.\n\nAll India Forward Bloc (Marxist group) (FBL-MG) and the All India Forward Bloc (Ruikar group) (FBL-RG): The All India Forward Bloc was established by Subhash Chandra Bose as a faction within the Congress, a few months after he resigned from the post of Congress president in 1939.\n\nBy the time of the first general election, the Forward Bloc itself had split into two factions; the Marxist group led by prominent Marxist leader Sheel Bhadra Yagee and the Ruikar group, and the \u2018Subhashist\u2019 led by R.S. Ruikar and S.S. Kavishar. While the former managed to secure one seat in the Lok Sabha in 1952, the other won nil.\n\nBose first established the Forward Bloc to rally all the left-wing elements within the Congress under different leadership while still remaining within the party. Besides Bose, Ruikar and Yagee, early members included Senapati Bapat, Ukkirapandi Muthuramalingam and the like.\n\nSoon after Independence and Partition, when the Congress began to remove dissenters from party ranks, the Forward Bloc decided to officially sever ties with it and form its own independent presence. However, differences between the Marxists and the Subhashits became more and more evident and the two factions; the FBL-MG and FBL-RG, drifted further apart, eventually contesting the elections separately.\n\nIn 1955, Yagee and Mohan Singh decided to re-join the Congress, however, they hadn\u2019t consulted any of the other members. This decision led to their expulsion from the group and thereafter, Hemanta Kumar Bose was elected as the new chairman and R.K. Haldulkar, the new general secretary.\n\nOver the years, as leaders exited the party, its importance continued to dwindle in the few states where it was prominent, leaving its presence today largely restricted to West Bengal. Even in the state, the Forward Bloc now only plays second-fiddle to the CPI(M) as a part of the Left Front Alliance. However, the party has no MPs or MLAs in the legislature at present.\n\nAlso read: Modi\u2019s Portrayal of Netaji as a Hindu Militarist Does the Secular, Socialist Bose a Disservice\n\nKrishikar Lok Party (KLP): The KLP was formed by farm leader N. G. Ranga when he decided to break away from the Hyderabad State Praja Party, which itself was formed when Ranga and Tanguturi Prakasam decided to part ways with the Congress\n\nThe party managed to secure only one seat in the first Indian election; Manak Chand won the seat for the party from the Bharatpur Sawaimadhopur constituency.\n\nThereafter, the KLP contested the 1952 assembly elections in Madras and secured 15 seats in the Vidhan Sabha. After the assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh in 1955, on Nehru\u2019s request, the KLP was merged into the Congress. Ranga was elected to the second Lok Sabha in 1957 from the Tenali constituency on a Congress ticket.\n\nDisillusioned with Nehru\u2019s increasingly socialist politics such as instituting land reforms and cooperative farming process, in 1959, Ranga, along with C. Rajgopalachari, went on to break away from the Congress and establish the Swatantra Party. Ranga was elected its first president.\n\nThe Swatantra Party stood for a market-based capitalist economy in opposition to the socialist model emerging within the Congress; its leaders were of the belief that the good of the people would be maximised through minimal state intervention.\n\nThe Swatantra Party eventually joined the umbrella opposition to Indira Gandhi\u2019s Congress (R) after the emergency years, the Janata Party, dwindling into insignificance thereafter.\n\nBolshevik Party of India (BPI): The BPI had its roots in the labour union movement in Bengal in the 1930s and officially came into existence after a section of leaders from the CPI, led by Niharendu Dutt Mazumdar and other leaders such as Sisir Roy, Sudha Roy and the like broke away.\n\nThe BPI was preceded by the Bengal Labour Party, formed by Mazumdar, which had merged with the CPI in the 1930s but had maintained its own presence as well. When Subhash Bose\u2019s Forward Bloc broke from the Congress, the BPI chastised the CPI\u2019s decision to side with the Congress and thus, these labour leaders broke off to form the BPI in 1939.\n\nWhile the BPI supported the British effort in the Second World War initially, Mazumdar later supported the Quit India movement and, after he was released from jail, left the party and joined the Congress.\n\nAt the time of independence, Sisir Roy was serving as the party\u2019s general secretary and under his leadership, the party denounced India\u2019s partition and sought for a united India to break from the commonwealth and align itself with the likes of the Soviets and China.\n\nIn the first Indian general election, Sudha Roy was the sole candidate fielded by the BPI. She contested from Barrackpore constituency but was defeated by the Congress\u2019s Ramananda Das.\n\nAfter the first election, many members of the Forward Communist Party merged into the BPI, thus, while the party was based out of West Bengal, it gained bases in states such as Bihar and MP as well.\n\nIn the years that followed, prominent leader Biswanath Dubey left the party and after Sisir Roy\u2019s death in 1960, Sudha Roy called for the BPI to join the CPI, which party cadres rejected, prompting her to leave the party with her followers and join the CPI.\n\nAs even more leaders left the party, the BPI\u2019s share in national politics dwindled further. Today, it is limited to being part of the CPI(M)-led Left Front in West Bengal\n\nRevolutionary Communist Party of India (RCPI): The RCPI had its roots in the Communist League founded by Saumyendranath Tagore after he, along with other founding members, decided to break from the CPI in 1934. It had adopted the name, the \u2018Communist Party of India\u2019 at a party conference in 1941 but later decided to change its name to the \u2018Revolutionary Communist Party of India\u2019 to avoid any confusion.\n\nAfter independence and in the years before the first Indian election, the RCPI went through a split in leadership which saw one faction, led by Sudhir Dasgupta, take a more militant role in pushing for armed rebellion in India.\n\nThis \u2018rebel group\u2019 attempted to begin their armed revolt in 1949, stealing weapons from police posts and raiding factories. Several people died in the ensuing melee before the party members were caught. Around 40 cadres of the RCPI were arrested and sent to prison, Dasgupta being one of them, who was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThe other faction distanced itself from the insurrectional politics of the rebels and operated largely underground, although no formal ban was imposed on them at the time.\n\nLater, however, the RCPI attempted to mount a peasant uprising in Assam and seeking its secession from India. As the movement grew more violent and more and more casualties emerged, the government first banned the party and then employed police crackdowns on party cadres. Amidst the crackdown, the party also began losing its influence among the vote base.\n\nIn this light, the RCPI boycotted the 1952 elections. However, the Assam government withdrew the ban later that year.\n\nIn subsequent years, the party was involved in the forming of a few state governments; it was a part of the CPI(M)-led United Front government in West Bengal in 1969 and has then part of the Left Front alliance in West Bengal since it was formed, which was in power in the state until 2011."}]}
