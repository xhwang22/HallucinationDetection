{"William Allan Neilson was appointed president of Smith College in 1910.": [{"url": "https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/presidents", "page_content": "Kathleen McCartney\n\n2013\u2013Present\n\nSmith\u2019s 11th president, Kathleen McCartney, took office in 2013. McCartney, former dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education (HGSE), is an internationally recognized authority on child development and early education. The first in her family to go to college, she graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University with a bachelor of science in psychology and later earned a doctorate in psychology from Yale University. A signature accomplishment of her tenure at HGSE was the creation of a three-year doctorate in educational leadership developed in collaboration with the Harvard Business School and the Kennedy School of Government.\n\nSince assuming the presidency, McCartney has led a strategic planning effort that is resulting in important new academic and co-curricular programs that expand opportunities for women. She has forged partnerships with leading organizations, including the Harvard/MIT online education platform known as edX; the MassMutual Life Insurance Company, a supporter of data science initiatives; and the Posse Foundation. Under her leadership, Smith engaged noted architectural designer Maya Lin to re-envision its historic Neilson Library, in the context of its renowned Frederick Law Olmsted\u2013designed campus, and to create a modern intellectual learning common. The $110 million project opened its doors in 2021. Women for the World: The Campaign for Smith, which McCartney led to its culmination in 2016, raised $486 million, setting a record for the largest and most successful campaign ever undertaken by a women\u2019s college. Notably, the campaign raised close to $130 million for financial aid, including 103 new endowed scholarships. A central focus of McCartney\u2019s presidency has been increasing access for every student who wants to study at Smith. In October 2021, McCartney announced that the college will eliminate loans from its undergraduate financial aid packages, beginning in fall 2022, replacing them with college grants.\n\nCarol T. Christ\n\n2002\u201313\n\nA widely respected scholar of Victorian literature, Carol T. Christ took up her duties as Smith\u2019s 10th president in June 2002. In her first years at Smith, Christ launched an energetic program of outreach, innovation and long-range planning, including capital planning. She encouraged the development of coursework emphasizing fluency in American cultures and the diversity of experience of American ethnic groups and launched a review, conducted by members of the Smith faculty and outside scholars, to determine the distinctive intellectual traditions of the Smith curriculum and areas on which to build. Issued in 2007, The Smith Design for Learning: A Plan to Reimagine a Liberal Arts Education builds upon Smith\u2019s history of pedagogical innovation, identifying priority areas\u2014among them, international studies, environmental sustainability, and community engagement\u2014for significant investment over the coming decade.\n\nIn the area of capital planning, a number of major building projects came to fruition during Christ\u2019s tenure: the renovation and expansion of the Brown Fine Arts Center; a dramatic new campus center; a renovated Lyman Conservatory; the impressive Olin Fitness Center; new homes for the Poetry Center and the Mwangi Cultural Center; the renovation of Lilly Hall, home of the college\u2019s School for Social Work; and the construction of Conway House, an apartment building for Ada Comstock Scholars with children. Ford Hall, a state-of-the-art, sustainably designed classroom and laboratory facility named in recognition of its lead donor, the Ford Motor Company Fund, opened in fall 2009; it serves as home to the college\u2019s pioneering Picker Engineering Program as well as the departments of molecular biology, chemistry, biochemistry and computer science. Under Christ\u2019s leadership, Smith made significant commitments to environmental sustainability in its curriculum and campus operations, including the construction of a co-generation facility for power and heat and the dedication of the MacLeish Field Station, a 200-acre woodland tract in Whately, Mass., for environmental education and research.\n\nRuth Simmons\n\n1995\u20132001\n\nIn December 1994 Ruth Simmons was chosen as Smith\u2019s ninth president. With a long and distinguished career in higher education behind her, Simmons was the first African-American woman to head any top-ranked American college or university. Simmons galvanized the campus through an ambitious campus-wide self-study process that resulted in a number of landmark initiatives, including Praxis, a program that allows every Smith student the opportunity to elect an internship funded by the college; an engineering program, the first at a women\u2019s college; programs in the humanities that include the establishment of a poetry center and a peer-reviewed journal devoted to publishing scholarly works by and about women of color; and curricular innovations that include intensive seminars for first-year students and programs to encourage students\u2019 speaking and writing skills.\n\nA number of building projects were launched during Simmons\u2019 administration; most significant was the Brown Fine Arts Center, a $35-million expansion and renovation of the Smith College Museum of Art, art department and art library. Ground was broken in 2002 for a campus center, and renovation and expansion of the Lyman Conservatory was completed in 2003.\n\nSimmons left Smith in June 2001, assuming the presidency of Brown University. John M. Connolly, Smith\u2019s first provost, served as acting president for one year, skillfully guiding the college through the trauma of September 11, 2001, and its aftermath.\n\nMary Maples Dunn\n\n1985\u201395\n\nThe college that President Conway left to her successor was in some ways very different from the college served by Presidents Seelye, Burton and Neilson. When Mary Maples Dunn came to Smith in 1985 after many years as a professor of history and then as dean of Bryn Mawr College, Smith\u2019s student body had diversified. During its early decades the student body had been overwhelmingly Protestant, but by the 1970s, Roman Catholic and Jewish college chaplains served alongside the Protestant chaplain, reflecting the students' religious and ethnic variety. All racial, ethnic and religious groups are now well represented on campus, evidence of Smith\u2019s continuing moral and intellectual commitment to diversity.\n\nIn her decade as president, Mary Maples Dunn led the college through exciting and challenging times. During her tenure, the college raised more than $300 million, constructed two major buildings and renovated many more, enhanced communication on and off campus, attracted record numbers of applicants (while holding the quality of those applicants steady) and doubled the value of its endowment. Computer technology transformed the way Smith conducted its business. And the curriculum became broader in scope, with five new majors and increased course offerings in non-Western and neglected American cultures.\n\nJill Ker Conway\n\n1975\u201385\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s another important movement\u2014the women\u2019s movement\u2014was gathering momentum. This was to have a profound effect on American society and to confirm the original purpose of Smith College. The college began its second century in 1975 by inaugurating its first woman president, Jill Ker Conway, who came to Smith from Australia by way of Harvard and the University of Toronto. She was a charismatic and energetic leader with a vision for women's education, and her administration was marked by three major accomplishments: a large-scale renovation and expansion of Neilson Library, evidence of Smith\u2019s undiminished concern for the heart of the liberal arts; the rapid growth of the Ada Comstock Scholars Program, through which women beyond the traditional college age could earn a Smith degree; and exceptionally successful fund-raising efforts. Also during President Conway\u2019s administration, the Career Development Office was expanded to better counsel Smith students and alumnae about career opportunities and graduate training for women. Recognizing the rapidly growing emphasis on fitness and athletics for women, Smith built the Ainsworth Gymnasium and broke ground for new indoor and outdoor track and tennis facilities. President Conway\u2019s contributions underscored her commitment to women\u2019s colleges and a liberal arts education in today's society. Since leaving Smith, Conway has written an acclaimed series of memoirs; her 2001 book, A Woman's Education, concerns her Smith years.\n\nThomas Corwin Mendenhall\n\n1959\u201375\n\nWhen Thomas Corwin Mendenhall came from Yale in 1959 to become Smith\u2019s sixth president, both the college and the country at large were enjoying peace and prosperity. During the 1960s, social and cultural changes stirred the college profoundly, and a series of powerful movements influenced the larger society and the academic world alike. In response to the needs of increasingly independent and ambitious students, the curriculum was thoroughly revised. College-wide requirements were set aside and independent study encouraged. The college made more varied educational experiences available to Smith undergraduates by extending cooperation with its neighbors\u2014Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges and the University of Massachusetts. And Smith joined other private colleges in the Northeast to develop the Twelve College Exchange Program. The college added buildings with the most modern facilities for the study of the natural sciences, performing arts and fine arts. The new Fine Arts Center included the Smith College Museum of Art, now one of the most distinguished college museums in the country.\n\nThe 1960s saw the civil rights movement, the students\u2019 rights movement and the anti-war movement take root and grow at many of the country\u2019s universities and colleges, including Smith. Thanks to these movements and to the wisdom, tact and humor of President Mendenhall, the college emerged from the 1960s with a more precise awareness of student needs and an active, practical sense of social responsibility.\n\nMeanwhile, life in the college houses was changing. The old rules governing late evenings out and male visitors were relaxed, then abandoned. Not surprisingly, when Vassar began to accept men, and Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth to accept women as candidates for degrees, some members of the college community wondered whether Smith should also become coeducational. In 1971, a committee of trustees, faculty, administration, students and alumnae studied the question in detail. The committee concluded that admitting men as candidates for the Smith degree would detract from the founding purpose of the college, the best possible education for women.\n\nBenjamin Fletcher Wright\n\n1949\u201359\n\nBenjamin Fletcher Wright came from Harvard to become Smith\u2019s fifth president in 1949. The college had by then resumed its regular calendar and completed several much-needed building projects, including a new heating plant and a student recreation center named for retiring President Davis. The most memorable achievements of President Wright\u2019s administration were the strengthening of Smith's financial position and the defense of academic freedom during the 1950s.\n\nIn 1950, the $7 Million Fund Drive was triumphantly completed, enabling the college to improve facilities and increase faculty salaries. In 1955, the Helen Hills Hills Chapel was completed, giving Smith its own place of worship. The early 1950s were not, though, easy years for colleges; McCarthyism bred a widespread suspicion of any writing or teaching that might seem left of center. In defending his faculty members' right to political and intellectual independence, President Wright showed great courage and statesmanship. Complementing his achievements was the financial and moral support of Smith\u2019s Alumnae Association, by now the most devoted and active group of its kind in the country. Before President Wright\u2019s term ended, the college received a large gift for constructing a new faculty office and classroom building to be named for him.\n\nHerbert Davis\n\n1940\u201349\n\nPresident Neilson retired in 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, and for one year Elizabeth Cutter Morrow, an alumna trustee, served as acting president. Herbert Davis took office as Smith\u2019s fourth president in 1940 and reaffirmed the contributions that a liberal arts college could make to a troubled world. Already during World War I a group of Smith alumnae had gone to France to do relief work in the town of Gr\u00e9court; a replica of Gr\u00e9court\u2019s chateau gates is now emblematic of the college.\n\nSoon after the 1941 bombing of Pearl Harbor, the college agreed to provide facilities on its campus for the first Officers\u2019 Training Unit of the Women\u2019s Reserve, or WAVES. The college added a summer term from 1942 to 1945 so some students could graduate more quickly and go on to government, hospital or military service. Though physically isolated by travel restrictions, the college retained its cosmopolitan character as refugees came to lecture, teach and study. And foreign films were shown regularly in Sage Hall\u2014a practice that would give generations of students their sensitivity both to other cultures and to an important new art. President Davis' administration was marked by intensified academic life, reflecting his belief that serious study was a way of confronting the global threat to civilization.\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson\n\n1917\u201339\n\nWhen William Allan Neilson became president in 1917, Smith was already one of the largest women\u2019s colleges in the world. President Neilson shrewdly developed the advantages of large academic institutions while maintaining the benefits of a small one. Under his leadership, the size of the faculty continued to increase while the number of students remained at about 2,000. The curriculum was revised to provide a pattern still followed in many American colleges\u2014a broad foundation in various fields of knowledge, later complemented by the more intensive study of a major subject. The college expanded honors programs and initiated interdepartmental majors in science, landscape architecture and theatre. The School for Social Work, a coeducational graduate program, was founded. And more college houses were built, mainly in the Georgian complex called \u201cthe Quad,\u201d so that every student could live on campus.\n\nNot only did President Neilson help make Smith one of the leading colleges in the United States, whether for men or women, but he also developed it into an institution of international distinction and concerns. President Neilson, himself a Scotsman, married to a well-educated German woman, transformed the college from a high-minded but provincial community in the hinterland of Massachusetts into a cosmopolitan center constantly animated by ideas from abroad. Between the two world wars, he brought many important exiled or endangered foreign teachers, scholars, lecturers and artists to the college. Meanwhile, as long as peace lasted, Smith students went to study in France, Italy and Spain on the Junior Year Abroad Program instituted by the college in 1924.\n\nMarion LeRoy Burton\n\n1910\u201317\n\nSmith\u2019s second president, Marion LeRoy Burton, took office in 1910. President Burton, a graduate of Yale Divinity School, was a gifted public speaker with an especially acute business sense. He used these talents to help the college raise the amazing sum of $1,000,000\u2014a huge endowment campaign for any college at that time. With the college\u2019s increased endowment, President Burton was able to increase faculty salaries substantially and improve the faculty-to-student ratio. President Burton's fund drive also invigorated the alumnae, bringing them closer to the college than ever before and increasing their representation on the board of trustees.\n\nAlong with improving the financial state and business methods of the college, President Burton also contributed to a revision of the curriculum and initiated college honors programs to recognize outstanding students. He also helped to organize a cooperative admission system among Smith, Mount Holyoke, Wellesley and Vassar, the finest women\u2019s colleges of the day. President Burton\u2019s accomplishments are commemorated today by Burton Hall, the science building that his fund drive helped to finance.\n\nLaurenus Clark Seelye\n\n1873\u20131910\n\nSmith College opened in the fall of 1875 with 14 students and six faculty under the presidency of Laurenus Clark Seelye. Its small campus was planned to make the college part of what John M. Greene called \u201cthe real practical life\u201d of a New England town, rather than a sequestered academic preserve. College Hall, the Victorian Gothic administrative and classroom building, dominated the head of Northampton\u2019s Main Street. For study and worship, students used the town\u2019s well-endowed public library and various churches. Instead of a dormitory, students lived in a \u201ccottage,\u201d where life was more familial than institutional. Thus began the \"house\" system that, with some modifications, the college still employs today. The main lines of Smith\u2019s founding educational policy, laid down in President Seelye\u2019s inaugural address, remain valid today: then as now, the standards for admission were as high as those of the best colleges for men; then as now, a truly liberal education was fostered by a broad curriculum of the humanities, the fine arts and the natural and social sciences.\n\nDuring the 35 years of President Seelye\u2019s administration, the college prospered mightily. Its assets grew from Sophia Smith\u2019s original bequest of about $400,000 to more than $3,000,000; its faculty to 122; its student body to 1,635; its buildings to 35. These buildings included Alumnae Gymnasium, site of the first women\u2019s basketball game, and William Allan Neilson Library, one of the best-stocked undergraduate libraries in the country."}, {"url": "https://blogs.smith.edu/blog/smithipedia/administration/president-william-allan-neilson/", "page_content": "President William Allan Neilson\n\nPresident William Allan Neilson\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson was born March 28, 1869, in Doune, Pertshire Scotland. He attended Edinburgh University where he studied philosophy, graduating with honors in 1891. In order to join his brother who emigrated to Canada, Neilson crossed the Atlantic and began teaching in Upper Canada College in Toronto which was a boarding school for young boys.\n\nDeciding that he would prefer to be a scholar than a school master, Neilson went on to Harvard Graduate School in Cambridge, MA where he received his Ph.D. in English in 1898. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Neilson accepted a position as an Associate in English Literature at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, PA. Neilson taught at many other fine institutions before settling into the work of an administrator. Harvard, Radcliffe, the Sorbonne, Columbia, Barnard, and the University of California all made use of Neilson\u2019s talents at one time or another.\n\nIt was during his years as a professor that Neilson distinguished himself as the sort of scholar that an academic institution would wish to guide it. Before coming to Smith, Neilson made a name for himself both as a professor devoted to his students\u2019 learning (he was the only instructor of Helen Keller\u2019s who learned the manual sign language she used for communication) but also as a writer and an editor. Among his writings were Essentials of Poetry (1912) and The Facts about Shakespeare (1913). He also was the editor of Milton\u2019s Minor Poems (1899) and Shakespeare\u2019s Complete Works (1906). In 1917, Neilson was offered the Presidency of Smith College. He accepted on the conditions that he would not be obligated to raise money, and that a president\u2019s house would be built, with which the trustees complied.\n\nWhen Neilson arrived at Smith in 1917 perhaps one of the best assets that Neilson brought to Smith was his quick wit that endeared him to student, staff, faculty, and alumnae alike. At Neilson\u2019s final commencement in 1939 Cynthia Walsh recalled one particular instance: The seniors will especially recall that on May Day when they went to serenade him, his new collie puppy began to bark, not realizing what sweet voices were vying with the birds so early in the morning. When the president stepped out he said, \u201cMy dog thinks you\u2019re sheep,\u201d and the volleys of laughter which greeted this remark quite drowned out the rest: \u201d-but I think you\u2019re lambs!\u201d\n\nNeilson\u2019s accomplishments at Smith were many. When Neilson noticed that a majority of Smith students lived off campus he set about the task of purchasing and building new residences so that all Smith students would live on campus. After building the Great Quadrangle, purchasing Chapin House, Talbot House, Sessions House, and many others his goal was completed. During Neilson\u2019s 22-year term as president, the campus also saw the additions of Sage Music Hall, Scott Gymnasium, Tryon Art Gallery, the Alumnae House, the Infirmary, and the President\u2019s house.\n\nNeilson also established the Junior Year in France, Junior Year in Italy, and the Junior Year in Spain Programs. Special Honors, the Smith College Day School, and the School for Social Work were additions that Neilson made to the college. Never one to rest on his laurels, Neilson continued writing and editing while looking after the well being of 2,000 students. In 1920 he wrote History of English Literature and in 1922 he edited Roads to Knowledge. He also was the editor-in-chief of Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1934.\n\nWilliam A. Neilson died on February 13, 1946.\n\nFor further information please see: http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/smitharchives/manosca13.html\n\nThorp, Margaret Farrand, Neilson of Smith (NY: Oxford University Press), 1956"}, {"url": "https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/4/resources/25", "page_content": "The William Allan Neilson Papers consist of 21.75 linear feet of correspondence, newspaper clippings, manuscripts, press releases, lecture notes, texts of speeches, photographs, and miscellaneous papers which document Neilson's life and career. While these papers contain material dating from Neilson's years at Smith College (1917-1939), his official correspondence as president of the college is stored separately in the College Archives' holdings of records of the Office of the President.\n\n\n\nThe papers document Neilson's personal life with extensive family material. His letters to his brother and sisters are particularly valuable. Among other things these letters present Neilson's view of life at Bryn Mawr College under M. Carey Thomas, his strong opinions on world politics, his experiences tutoring Helen Keller at Radcliffe College, and his first impressions of Smith College. This series of letters is especially strong for the years between Neilson's arrival at Harvard University for graduate study in 1895 and his marriage in 1905. In addition to the Neilson family correspondence there is extensive correspondence between the Neilson and Muser families plus diaries and writings of Elisabeth Muser Neilson, her parents, and her sister. Much of the Muser family material is in German.\n\n\n\nOther personal material such as photographs, correspondence, class notes, and student essays document Neilson's youth and education. His love of his native Scotland and his study of its language and literature are clearly in evidence in his University of Edinburgh essays.\n\n\n\nCorrespondence and miscellaneous papers, 1917-1946, document such day-to-day concerns as finances, family health, the running of the household, and travel arrangements.\n\n\n\nNeilson's career as professor and scholar of English and Scottish literature is represented by class notes and correspondence with students and colleagues which date primarily from his years at Harvard and Radcliffe. Smith College material includes a few notes for courses Neilson taught in the English department but consists primarily of documentation of the events and celebrations of his presidency such as his appointment, inauguration, tenth and twentieth anniversaries, and retirement. Other material documents Neilson's affiliation with scholarly organizations such as the Modern Language Association, the Scottish Text Society, and the Shakespeare Association of America. There are also texts and notes for speeches on Shakespeare and Burns. Neilson's scholarly publications are represented by a number of articles, an unfinished manuscript for a book on allegory, and proofs for a 1942 edition of Shakespeare's plays and poems. Correspondence and news clippings document other writing and editorial projects in different stages of the work. Two such projects of particular interest are the 'five foot shelf' series of Harvard Classics, which Neilson edited with Charles W. Eliot, and the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, for which Neilson was editor-in-chief.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his work as professor, administrator, and scholar, Neilson was much in demand for committee work. As a respected educator and administrator, his advice and support was continually sought by educational institutions and organizations. Correspondence documents Neilson's work as a member of various committees for Harvard University, his suggestions on the planning of the campus and curriculum of Bennington College, and his advice and endorsements for the New School for Social Research and a variety of organizations promoting adult education such as the Affiliated Schools for Workers, the Eliot Foundation for Adult Education, and the Committee on University Extension in the Connecticut Valley.\n\n\n\nNeilson was also well-known for his vigorous support of liberal causes of the day. His political activities are reflected in his involvement with a large number of organizations most of which worked for civil liberties, peace, aid to refugees, or improved foreign relations. This work is documented by correspondence with such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Foreign Policy Association, the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia, the National Refugee Service, various League of Nations organizations, and the Commission to Study the Organization of Peace.\n\n\n\nAll of Neilson's interests and concerns are in evidence in his speeches and writings. Texts contained in the papers are a rich source for the study of life at Smith College, and trends in education and politics during Neilson's term as president of Smith (1917-1939). News clippings document the quite considerable attention paid to his views.\n\n\n\nNeilson was a renowned speaker who seldom prepared a text, preferring to talk from cursory notes made shortly before the speech was to be delivered. Because of this process the texts contained in the papers are almost exclusively transcriptions. Some of them were edited for publication, others remain more or less as they were delivered. The papers also contain some of Neilson's handwritten notes for speeches.\n\n\n\nCorrespondence, citations, and news clippings document Neilson's many awards and honors and a group of biographical articles gives an overview of Neilson's life and work. The papers also contain notes, typescripts, and correspondence for Margaret Farrand Thorp's 1956 biography Nelson of Smith."}, {"url": "https://libex.smith.edu/omeka/exhibits/show/neilson/william-allan-neilson", "page_content": "For 37 years the building which was geographically and intellectually the heart of the campus was called simply \u201cThe Library.\u201d When President William Allan Neilson died in 1946, the Trustees named it as a memorial tribute to him.\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson, Smith\u2019s third president, died on February 13 at the College Infirmary.

He worked at the University Settlement, teaching the poor of Edinburgh's slums. In 1891 Neilson immigrated with his family to Canada, where his brother had settled. After brief periods of teaching at Bryn Mawr College (1898 - 1900), Harvard (1900 - 1904), and Columbia (1904 - 1906), he was in 1906 appointed professor of English at Harvard, where he remained until 1917, when he accepted the presidency of Smith College. In 1904 he spent the summer in Offenburg in the family of Oskar Muser, a lawyer and member of the Landtag of the Duchy of Baden. Neilson became an American citizen in 1905. At Harvard, Neilson won distinction as both teacher and scholar. He taught Chaucer, Shakespeare and other Elizabethan dramatists, Milton, and various nineteenth-century authors. He joined President Charles W. Eliot as associate editor of the Harvard Classics (the 50-volume \"Five-Foot Bookshelf, \" 1909-1910), writing the notes and introductions. His edition of Shakespeare's Complete Dramatic and Poetic Works, revised with Prof. Charles J. Hill in 1942, is a standard and important one. During his career at Smith, he served as editor-in-chief of the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, which appeared in 1934. Neilson hesitated for some time before accepting the Smith presidency. His two predecessors, L. Clark Seelye and Marion Le Roy Burton, had both been clergymen. Neilson had no desire to increase the size of the student body of Smith, fixed at 2, 000. He was, however, determined to provide college residences for all students, many of whom were living in private dormitories, a practice felt to be undemocratic. In the course of adding ten new dormitories he greatly enlarged the physical college and built two brick quadrangles on a tract adjacent to the old campus, which preserved the college's tradition of small dormitory units. He beautified the campus by planting and landscaping. In spite of his insistence that fund raising was not his province, Neilson not only balanced the budget, even during the depression, but through his great personal popularity brought sizable gifts to the college that significantly increased the endowment. He maintained a balanced faculty of men and women. Himself a teacher during the early years of his presidency, he brought to Smith many distinguished scholars and teachers from abroad as well as from the United States, with the result that he left the college well on a par with leading universities. He won the respect and loyalty of the faculty for his fairmindedness and devotion to academic freedom. Always a fighter for liberal causes, Neilson was violently opposed by the local community and by some of the Smith faculty for his defense of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. His compassion for the victims of Nazism led him to become a director of the National Refugee Service and co-chairman of the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born. As the national and international situation grew more tense through the 1930's, he devoted his Monday chapel talks to attempts to make students more aware of the issues in national and international affairs. After his retirement in 1939, Neilson settled in Falls Village, Connecticut, where he had bought a remodeled farmhouse. He continued to spend part of the winters in Northampton, working on a history of Smith College, and he died there in 1946 of a coronary thrombosis. His ashes were buried on the Smith campus, appropriately in the midst of a natural garden he had planned on a hillside."}, {"url": "https://findingaids.smith.edu/repositories/4/resources/35", "page_content": "William Allan Neilson served as president of Smithh College for 22 years.

Harvard, Radcliffe, the Sorbonne, Columbia, Barnard, and the University of California all made use of Neilson's talents at one time or another.\n\n\n\nIt was during his years as a professor that Neilson distinguished himself as the sort of scholar that an academic institution would wish to guide it. Before coming to Smith, Neilson made a name for himself as a professor devoted to his students' learning. He was the only instructor of Helen Keller's who learned the manual sign language she used for communication. He was also an accomplished writer and editor. Among his writings were Essentials of Poetry (1912)and The Facts about Shakespeare (1913). He also was the editor of Milton's Minor Poems (1899) and Shakespeare's Complete Works (1906).\n\n\n\nIn 1917, Neilson was offered the Presidency of Smith College. He accepted on the conditions that he would not be obligated to raise money, and that a president's house would be built, conditions the trustees complied with.\n\n\n\nNeilson's quick wit that endeared him to student, staff, faculty, and alumnae. At Neilson's final commencement in 1939 Cynthia Walsh recalled one particular instance:\n\n\n\nThe seniors will especially recall that on May Day when they went to serenade him, his new collie puppy began to bark, not realizing what sweet voices were vying with the birds so early in the morning. When the president stepped out he said, \"My dog thinks you're sheep,\" and the volleys of laughter which greeted this remark quite drowned out the rest: \"-but I think you're lambs!\"\n\n\n\nNeilson's accomplishments included purchasing and building new residences so that all Smith students would live on campus. He was responsible for the building of the Great Quadrangle, purchasing Chapin House, Talbot House, Sessions House, and many others. During Neilson's 22-year term as president, the campus also saw the additions of Sage Music Hall, Scott Gymnasium, Tryon Art Gallery, the Alumnae House, the Infirmary, and the President's house.\n\n\n\nNeilson also established the Junior Year in France, Junior Year in Italy, and the Junior Year in Spain Programs. Special Honors, the Smith College Day School, and the School for Social Work were additions that Neilson made to the college.\n\n\n\nNeilson continued writing and editing while looking after the well being of 2,000 students. In 1920 he wrote History of English Literature and in 1922 he edited Roads to Knowledge. He also was the editor-in-chief of Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1934."}, {"url": "https://libraries.smith.edu/about/history-smith-college-libraries", "page_content": "William Allan Neilson Library\n\nFrom 1875 to 1909, Smith College relied primarily on the private Clarke Library and the public Forbes Library (dedicated in 1894). The first college reference library was formed with a $4,000 allocation in 1878 and housed in various rooms in College Hall; it was moved to Seelye Hall when that building opened in 1900.\n\nThe core of the present main building was erected in 1909, funded by a gift from Andrew Carnegie and matching gifts from alumnae and friends. It was enlarged in 1937 and, in 1946, named the William Allan Neilson Library in honor of the College's third president. In 1962, two wings were added and extensive interior rearrangements made. The last major expansion and renovation began in 1978 and was completed with the rededication of Neilson Library in November 1982 and of the converted Alumnae Gymnasium in May 1983.\n\nIn the fall of 1987, the libraries acquired their millionth volume. This watershed was celebrated by the acquisition of the Epistole Devotissime of St. Catherine of Siena in an Aldine edition of 1500 to be designated officially as volume 1,000,000. The Smith College Libraries now hold over 1.4 million items including books, periodicals, microforms, maps, scores, recordings, manuscripts, archives, film and video, computer-readable materials, graphic arts, memorabilia and cuneiform tablets.\n\nIn 2010, the college engaged Shepley Bulfinch to partner on a master plan for all of the college\u2019s libraries. Soon after, the college worked with Shepley Bulfinch on several studies to assess what could feasibly be accomplished with current library space. In 2014, the trustees approved the concept of a redesign of Neilson and the hiring of an architect. Construction for the project began in 2017 and the new Neilson Library opened on March 29, 2021. It retains the original 1909 building while restoring the campus flow disrupted by a series of later additions. Learn more about the New Neilson Library renovation project.\n\nBranch Libraries\n\nWerner Josten Performing Arts Library\n\nThe Music Department began its collection in 1911 and hired the first music librarian in 1922. The library was transferred administratively to the college Libraries in 1968. That same year it was moved to new quarters in the Mendenhall Performing Arts Center and named for Werner Josten (a professor in the Music Department).\n\nYoung Science Library\n\nStarted in 1888, the science department libraries originally included Chemistry in Stoddard Hall, Physics in Lilly Hall, Geology in Seelye Hall, Botany, Zoology and Bacteriology in Burton Hall. Other collections, now merged with the Neilson Library or Science Library collections, were located in Scott Gymnasium (Physical Education) and the Plant House (Horticulture). In 1937, some thought was given to starting a psychology library in Pierce Hall, but the plan was never realized.\n\nThe science libraries were consolidated and became part of the Smith College Libraries in 1965 when they were moved into the Science Library in Sabin-Reed Hall. In 1991, the Science Library moved to Bass Hall and was named the Anita O'K. and Robert R. Young Science Library. In December 2016, Young Science Library was closed so that the building could be used as the main campus library (the Young Library) during the construction of the New Neilson Library (2017-2021). Materials from Young Library were moved to Neilson Library and the Young Library closed in 2021.\n\nHillyer Art Library\n\nThe Art Department started a collection of books and other materials as early as 1876. The Hillyer library was transferred administratively from the Art Department to the college Libraries in 1968.\n\nThe Hillyer Art Library, after a few years in Stoddard Hall during the construction of the new Fine Arts Center, occupied its present facility in 1972.\n\nDuring the renovation of the Fine Arts Center from 2000 to 2002, art library collections were divided between temporary art library facilities in Bell Hall at the Clarke School for the Deaf and the Smith College Libraries storage facility at 126 West Street. With reconstruction of the Brown Fine Arts Center complete, Hillyer Art Library reopened its new facilities in August 2002.\n\nSpecial Collections\n\nMortimer Rare Book Collection\n\nAs a part of the 1962 addition to the Neilson Library, the paneled Rare Book Room was created with its own secure stacks.\n\nThe collection of rare books had been started by its first curator, Marion Brown, sometime in the early 1940s with items culled from the general collection. In January 1994 the Board of Trustees voted to name it the Mortimer Rare Book Room, in honor of Ruth Mortimer Lancaster '53, curator and assistant librarian since 1975. Following her death on January 31, 1994, the room was dedicated in April of 1994 amidst an outpouring of special funds and gifts. In summer 2017 the Mortimer Rare Book Room, together with the rest of the Smith College Special Collections, was temporarily relocated to the Young Library in order to make way for the construction of the New Neilson Library (2017-2021). The Mortimer Rare Book Collection moved to its permanent home in Neilson Library in 2021.\n\nView a history of the Mortimer Rare Book Room, written by Barbara Blumenthal '75, who was the Rare Book Specialist from 1993-2017.\n\nSmith College Archives & the Sophia Smith Collection\n\nThe College formally established the Smith College Archives in 1921 when, after years of unofficial collecting, Nina Browne, class of 1882, was appointed archivist of the College.\n\nThe Sophia Smith Collection, one of the two principal repositories for primary sources in U.S. women's history, was founded in 1942 by the Friends of the Libraries.\n\nThese collections were administratively separate from the College Library until 1984, when they became library departments. From the 1960's, they occupied space in Neilson Library, and in 1982 moved to the renovated and now-adjoining Alumnae Gymnasium. In summer 2017 the Sophia Smith Collection and College Archives, together with the Mortimer Rare Book Room, were temporarily relocated to the Young Library in order to make way for the construction of the New Neilson Library (2017-2021). Both the College Archives and Sophia Smith Collection moved to their permanent home in Neilson Library in 2021.\n\nEarly Automation and Library Practice\n\nDuring the first seventy-two years of its existence, the Library used its own adaptation of the Dewey Decimal classification to organize its collections. As these collections grew larger and more complex, the numbering became long and difficult to interpret. In July 1971 it was decided to abandon decimal classification and use the Library of Congress classification. The Mortimer Rare Book Room decided to continue use of the decimal classification for that collection until 1996 when it adopted the Library of Congress classification system. A local system was devised for classifying Smith College theses by teaching departments, and government documents were classed by GPO and UN numbers.\n\nThe Smith College Libraries' first automation efforts were in 1974 when the department joined the New England Library Information Network (NELINET). Participation in NELINET provided the Libraries access via interactive terminals to the international shared bibliographic data of OCLC, Inc. New techniques for both cataloging and interlibrary loans were introduced. By 1981, all of the Five College libraries signed a contract with OCLC to develop a local integrated library system with union catalog, acquisitions, serials control, cataloging and circulation components. In 1985, all five libraries began using the LS2000 system for cataloging. The Circulation department in the Neilson Library started using the system for loans in January 1988. The card catalogue in the Neilson Library was frozen (left in place but no longer maintained) in July 1988, with Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) terminals replacing it. The Young Science Library automated its circulation through LS2000 in 1990. Also that year, the Smith College Libraries purchased a stand-alone automated serials and acquisitions system from Innovative Interfaces, Inc.\n\nIn 1992, given various ongoing difficulties with the LS2000 system, the Five College libraries began planning for a replacement system; administrators and computing staffs from each campus were involved. In 1993, a contract was signed with Innovative Interfaces, Inc., and in early 1994 the Five College Online Library System was brought up with all campuses employing modules for circulation, public access, and cataloging. Serials and acquisitions were added to the system that spring and Smith folded in its stand-alone operation. This was the first library automated system for Smith and the Five Colleges that integrated all functions across campuses, and the first time that all Smith's branch libraries are automated for circulation, reserves and serials management.\n\nIn 1992, with funding from the Keck and Davis foundations, a LAN-based system of locally mounted CD-ROM databases was brought up at Smith in the Young and Neilson Libraries. The following year, Neilson was completely rewired for computer networking; in 1994 when Innovative Interfaces was launched, the Libraries moved all administrative computing to a networked file-server configuration. Access to e-mail, word processing, and library systems and databases was combined and extended. In the fall of 1994, the CD-ROM network was expanded, and a new menu interface introduced on public-access computers. Entitled the \"Smith Libraries Gateway,\" the menu provided a single-point of access to the OPAC, the CD-ROM network, licensed databases and Internet resources. The libraries and the Information Systems Department began active collaboration in designing menu interfaces and in training faculty and students in the use of the Internet.\n\nThe \u201cElectronic Classroom,\u201d located on Level 1 of the Neilson Library, opened in February 2000. The room contained twenty student and one instructor computers, a printers and projection and accommodated classes of up to forty students. The primary purpose of this classroom was to offer library instruction to classes. When not in use for classes, the room was used for student study and other activities requiring computers.\n\nAlumnae Gymnasium\n\nIn 1890, the Alumnae Gymnasium (Alumnae Gym) was built using funds raised by the Alumnae Association. The building of the Gymnasium was the association\u2019s first major achievement and continues to be a visual testament of alumnae devotion.\n\nAlumnae Gymnasium is the work of distinguished architect William C. Brocklesby. The prominent feature in the central bay of the gymnasium - the rusticated round-headed arch - as well as the broad planes of the roofs and the central tower all show the responsive nature of Brocklesby to the Romanesque Revival style of Henry Hobson Richardson, a powerful influence on the American architecture during the 19th century.\n\nIn 1924, Alumnae Gymnasium became an adjunct to the new Scott Gymnasium after it was over-burdened by the increased number of sports and activities that followed the College\u2019s expansion. Alumnae Gym was a space for individual sports and recreation, parties and celebrations. It was also used as a theater when the Students\u2019 Building was demolished to make way for the Science Center.\n\nIn 1974-1975, a plan was made to demolish Alumnae Gymnasium due to a proposed expansion made to the Neilson Library, but this plan failed to be realized due to mounting Alumnae protests. An alternative plan was made to incorporate the old building into the new part of the Neilson Library, and an Alumnae rallied to raise money. Alumnae Gym was adapted to become a center for the most advanced techniques in library service as well as house the College Archives and the Sophia Smith Collection.\n\nIn 1984, the Nonprint Resources Center (NPRC) was opened in the lower level of the Alumnae Gymnasium and its first Director was appointed in 1987. In 1991, the former Electronics Department of the College was incorporated into the NPRC. In 1999, the NPRC split from the Libraries and became an administrative unit of Information Technology Services called Media Services. At that time, the collection of videotapes, films and other media materials became a unit of the Public Services Division of the Libraries. In 2001, the nonprint materials were moved to the circulation department of Neilson Library. In 2005, the Center was renamed the Center for Media Production (CMP) under the auspices of Educational Technology Services, a unit of Information Technology Services. In 2017, the Center for Media Production relocated to the Henshaw Complex to make way for the construction of the New Neilson Library (2017-2021).\n\nIn May 2017, Alumnae Gymnasium closed for renovation, with the College Archives and the Sophia Smith Collection moving temporarily to the Young Library, and then permanently to the renovated Neilson Library in 2021. The Alumnae Gym renovation was also concluded in 2021, and now houses additional Smith College Libraries spaces, services, and staff.\n\nNonprint Resources\n\nThe Nonprint Resources Center (NPRC) was opened in 1984 in the lower level of the Alumnae Gym and its first Director appointed in 1987. In 1991, the former Electronics Department of the College was incorporated into the NPRC. In 1999 the Center split from the Libraries and became an administrative unit of Information Technology Services called Media Services. At that time, the collection of videotapes, films and other media materials became a unit of the Public Services Division of the Libraries.

In 2017 the Center for Media Production relocated to the Henshaw Complex to make way for the construction of the new Neilson Library (2017-2021).\n\nClarke School for the Deaf\n\nSmith College and the Clarke School for the Deaf jointly maintain on the Clarke campus, the Rogers Hall Professional Library which was renovated and enlarged in 1977. Holdings of this library are now integrated into the Smith College Libraries' online catalog and the staffs of the libraries cooperate to facilitate cataloging, acquisitions and other services. The Library at 47 Round Hill Rd. was closed in June 2012. Materials were transferred to the Smith libraries collections.\n\nFive College Consortium\n\nIn 1951 Smith joined the University of Massachusetts, Amherst College and Mount Holyoke College to form the Hampshire Inter-Library Center (HILC). This consortium was the first instance of cooperation among the four schools (and one of the earliest library consortia in the United States). The Center was intended as a depository for less frequently used research materials, primarily serials and large sets, from the collections of the four libraries and jointly owned by all four. Hampshire College, which opened in 1970, joined HILC as its fifth member. HILC later came under the administrative umbrella of Five Colleges, Inc., and its collections were distributed among the member libraries.\n\nToday Five Colleges, Inc. is a nonprofit educational consortium to promote the broad educational and cultural objectives of its member institutions. The Dean of Smith College Libraries is part of the Five College Librarians Council and a series of staff committees facilitates communication and collaboration.\n\nKahn Institute\n\nIn September 2000, The Louise W. and Edmund J. Kahn Liberal Arts Institute occupied permanent quarters on the third floor, south wing, of Neilson Library. Developed during the college's 1997 self study, the Kahn Institute provides a setting--outside the curriculum but creatively linked to it--in which faculty, together with students and visiting scholars, writers and performers, work together intensively on projects of broad scope. In 2017 the Kahn Institute relocated to 21 Henshaw Avenue to make way for the construction of the new Neilson Library (2017-2021).\n\nOnline Exhibitions"}, {"url": "https://snaccooperative.org/view/25680249", "page_content": "Educator, editor and author.

WorldCat record id: 51231676\n\nWilliam Allan Neilson was born March 28, 1869, in Doune, Pertshire Scotland. He attended Edinburgh University where he studied philosophy, graduating with honors in 1891. In order to join his brother who emigrated to Canada, Neilson crossed the Atlantic and began teaching in Upper Canada College in Toronto which was a boarding school for young boys.\n\nDeciding that he would prefer to be a scholar than a school master, Neilson went on to Harvard Graduate School in Cambridge, MA where he received his Ph.D. in English in 1898. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Neilson accepted a position as an Associate in English Literature at Bryn Mawr College in Bryn Mawr, PA. Neilson taught at many other fine institutions before settling into the work of an administrator.

He also was the editor of Milton's Minor Poems (1899) and Shakespeare's Complete Works (1906).\n\nIn 1917, Neilson was offered the Presidency of Smith College. He accepted on the conditions that he would not be obligated to raise money, and that a president's house would be built, with which the trustees complied.\n\nPerhaps one of the best assets that Neilson brought to Smith was his quick wit that endeared him to student, staff, faculty, and alumnae alike. At Neilson's final commencement in 1939 Cynthia Walsh recalled one particular instance:\n\nThe seniors will especially recall that on May Day when they went to serenade him, his new collie puppy began to bark, not realizing what sweet voices were vying with the birds so early in the morning.

Special Honors, the Smith College Day School, and the School for Social Work were additions that Neilson made to the college.\n\nNever one to rest on his laurels, Neilson continued writing and editing while looking after the well being of 2,000 students. In 1920 he wrote History of English Literature and in 1922 he edited Roads to Knowledge. He also was the editor-in-chief of Webster's New International Dictionary, 2nd edition, 1934.\n\nFrom the guide to the Office of President William Allan Neilson Files RG 32., 1917-1939, (Smith College Archives)\n\n: Born in Doune, Perthshire, Scotland, March 28\n\n: Attended Montrose Academy\n\n: Studied at the University of Edinburgh, received M.A.\n\n: Immigrated with family to Canada\n\n: Resident English Master, Upper Canada College, Toronto\n\n: Graduate work in English, Harvard University, M.A. (1897), Ph.D. (1898)\n\n: Associate Professor of English Literature, Bryn Mawr College\n\n: Instructor of English, Harvard University\n\n: Professor of English, Columbia University\n\n: Became American citizen\n\n: Professor of English, Harvard University\n\n: Married Elisabeth Muser in Offenburg, Germany, June 25\n\n: Exchange Professor, University of Paris\n\n: President of Smith College\n\n: Trustee, Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Education Served intermittently on the College Entrance Examination Board\n\n: Initiated Special Honors program at Smith College\n\n: President, Modern Language Association\n\n: Editorial Board of G.C.

He worked at the University Settlement, teaching the poor of Edinburgh's slums. In 1891 Neilson immigrated with his family to Canada, where his brother had settled. After brief periods of teaching at Bryn Mawr College (1898 - 1900), Harvard (1900 - 1904), and Columbia (1904 - 1906), he was in 1906 appointed professor of English at Harvard, where he remained until 1917, when he accepted the presidency of Smith College. In 1904 he spent the summer in Offenburg in the family of Oskar Muser, a lawyer and member of the Landtag of the Duchy of Baden. Neilson became an American citizen in 1905. At Harvard, Neilson won distinction as both teacher and scholar. He taught Chaucer, Shakespeare and other Elizabethan dramatists, Milton, and various nineteenth-century authors. He joined President Charles W. Eliot as associate editor of the Harvard Classics (the 50-volume \"Five-Foot Bookshelf, \" 1909-1910), writing the notes and introductions. His edition of Shakespeare's Complete Dramatic and Poetic Works, revised with Prof. Charles J. Hill in 1942, is a standard and important one. During his career at Smith, he served as editor-in-chief of the second edition of Webster's New International Dictionary, which appeared in 1934. Neilson hesitated for some time before accepting the Smith presidency. His two predecessors, L. Clark Seelye and Marion Le Roy Burton, had both been clergymen. Neilson had no desire to increase the size of the student body of Smith, fixed at 2, 000. He was, however, determined to provide college residences for all students, many of whom were living in private dormitories, a practice felt to be undemocratic. In the course of adding ten new dormitories he greatly enlarged the physical college and built two brick quadrangles on a tract adjacent to the old campus, which preserved the college's tradition of small dormitory units. He beautified the campus by planting and landscaping. In spite of his insistence that fund raising was not his province, Neilson not only balanced the budget, even during the depression, but through his great personal popularity brought sizable gifts to the college that significantly increased the endowment. He maintained a balanced faculty of men and women. Himself a teacher during the early years of his presidency, he brought to Smith many distinguished scholars and teachers from abroad as well as from the United States, with the result that he left the college well on a par with leading universities. He won the respect and loyalty of the faculty for his fairmindedness and devotion to academic freedom. Always a fighter for liberal causes, Neilson was violently opposed by the local community and by some of the Smith faculty for his defense of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. His compassion for the victims of Nazism led him to become a director of the National Refugee Service and co-chairman of the Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born. As the national and international situation grew more tense through the 1930's, he devoted his Monday chapel talks to attempts to make students more aware of the issues in national and international affairs. After his retirement in 1939, Neilson settled in Falls Village, Connecticut, where he had bought a remodeled farmhouse. He continued to spend part of the winters in Northampton, working on a history of Smith College, and he died there in 1946 of a coronary thrombosis. His ashes were buried on the Smith campus, appropriately in the midst of a natural garden he had planned on a hillside."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/William-Allan-Neilson", "page_content": "William Allan Neilson (28 March 1869 \u2013 1946) was a Scottish-American educator, writer and lexicographer, graduated in the University of Edinburgh in 1891 and became a Ph.D. in Harvard University in 1898.

About 1867 he returned to Almonte, where he trained as a machinist. After securing his journeyman\u2019s papers he found work in Toronto with iron-founders Dickey, Neill and Company. In 1873 he moved to Brockville; at the time of his marriage he advertised himself as an agent for Singer sewing machines. By 1878 he had become the proprietor of a fancy goods store, but he did not meet with much success. After falling into insolvency in the early 1880s, he gave temporary responsibility for the store to his wife; in 1889 he announced that he was selling out, \u201chaving made arrangements to open a business in Chicago.\u201d\n\nInstead, Neilson moved in 1890 to Toronto. Again insolvent, he opened a grocery, flour, and feed business in his wife\u2019s name on Parkdale (Sorauren) Avenue. It too proved disappointing; on at least one occasion he left to work for ready money on a brother\u2019s farm in North Dakota. Many years later he said that he had produced his first ice-cream \u2013 \u201ca few gallons daily\u201d \u2013 in 1891. By 1893, however, he had quit retailing altogether and relocated on Lynd Avenue, where, aided by his wife and children, he began manufacturing ice-cream on a commercial scale. Reportedly some 3,750 gallons were produced in the first season. Although the family kept a few cows, when more cream was required Neilson purchased whole milk, took off the cream, and retailed the skim milk door-to-door along with his wife\u2019s mincemeat.\n\nNeilson built his reputation on high-quality products made with the purest ingredients, a reputation that he would carefully guard. His ice-cream had a very high butterfat content \u2013 in 1908 it would test at 21.9 to 24.9 per cent, making it substantially richer than the products of his competitors or the premium brands of today. In the early years most of his sales were to druggists, confectioners, and restaurants and took the form of bulk, two-gallon containers packed in crushed ice and salt. As well, he produced fancy and seasonal moulded novelties. Until the turn of the century his chief rivals were the bakers, dairies, and confectioners who made ice-cream in the warmer months. In 1900, to advance their own knowledge, Mary Neilson and her son Fred Harry Morden attended the dairy school at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph. That same year, in Toronto, Walter Edward Hart Massey* and others founded the City Dairy Company Limited to produce sanitary milk products, a large-scale venture that targeted in particular the more than 300 local dealers who delivered milk in unsterilized containers and the Italian street vendors who sold penny ices.\n\nThough Neilson may have welcomed such high-minded competition, he took no chances and moved decisively to strengthen his business. He stopped buying milk, gave up his milk routes, and contracted to buy the cream he needed. Next, taking his lead from a rival (probably City Dairy), he began about 1903 to package his ice-cream as bricks as well as in bulk. Unlike his competitor, which made quart-sized bricks, he adopted the pint, an astute move when few homes had the means to store ice-cream properly. He also declined to follow the example of manufacturers who opened ice-cream parlours in competition with their customers. By 1910 he claimed to supply over 500 Toronto confectioners and druggists daily, having virtually saturated the market. Ice-cream from City Dairy, his largest competitor, was available in fewer than a third this number of outlets. In time Neilson also acquired considerable expertise in distribution, most of it within 600 miles of Toronto.\n\nThe new factory Neilson opened on Gladstone Avenue in 1905 was essential to the growth of his business. Equipped with the most modern refrigerating equipment, it had a daily capacity of 2,500 gallons of ice-cream and 15 tons of ice. Additions were made in 1906 to accommodate ice-crushers and tanks, and in 1910 and 1912 for the manufacture of confectionery. In 1907 the business was incorporated as William Neilson Limited.\n\nNeilson\u2019s diversification into confectionery started modestly enough in 1908 as a way of keeping his ice-cream makers busy during the winter. The shift also made sense because the shopkeepers who stocked his ice-cream sold confectionery too. By 1911 he was offering at least three varieties of boxed milk chocolates; shortly afterwards he launched a line of chocolate bars similar to ones introduced by the firms of Gilbert White Ganong and William Church Moir* in the Maritimes and John Warren Cowan* in Toronto. As the demand for chocolate exceeded expectations, the sideline took on its own identity. Ideas of sharing staff were abandoned when sales of both ice-cream and candy boomed and when it became clear that the ice-cream makers, most of them men, had less dexterity than women for dipping candy. In 1912 Neilson employed between 160 and 170 females in his candy department and about 100 men elsewhere, as ice-cream makers, delivery men, and clerks. By the outbreak of war in 1914, he was making more than 560,000 pounds of chocolate per annum.\n\nIn 1911 Neilson had purchased a former cheese factory in Beachville, Ont., and equipped it to process milk from the area\u2019s many dairy farms, thus securing a larger and more reliable supply of cream. When Canada\u2019s dairy and cold storage commissioner surveyed 60 ice-cream manufacturers on the eve of World War I, all reported growing volumes. The cream they used, the commissioner estimated, was equivalent to that required to make about two million pounds of butter. Since Neilson\u2019s annual production of ice-cream was then about one million gallons, it follows that his share of the Canadian market (excluding the amount made in homes and on farms) exceeded 60 per cent.\n\nAfter William Neilson\u2019s death in 1915, his son Morden became president of the prospering company; another son, Charles Edward, was secretary-treasurer, and a third son, James William Allen, was a vice-president. In the manner perhaps of their mother, Morden had been a strong source of support and advice since the late 1890s. Indeed, without his help it is doubtful that Neilson, who was 49 when he began his greatest venture, could have been as successful. Ice-cream and chocolate were his life, and to them he devoted all his energies.\n\nStephen A.

Bill attended Franklin and Bellerive State schools and (A. G.) Ogilvie High School, New Town, which prepared students in commercial subjects for the Intermediate certificate. Leaving school at 14, he entered Commonwealth employment as a junior clerk in the Postmaster-General\u2019s Department. At 16 he joined the Australian Labor Party. In November 1946 he was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly as a member for Franklin, the youngest serving parliamentarian in the British Commonwealth and the youngest candidate ever elected to an Australian parliament. He was immediately elected Labor whip, a role he retained until 1955.\n\nOn 25 May 1948 at the office of the government statist, Melbourne, Neilson married 18-year-old Jill Benjamin. The pair had eloped when her father refused to consent to the marriage because of her age. Her mother, Phyllis Benjamin, was later a Labor member (1952-75) of the State\u2019s Legislative Council and, as leader of the government in the Upper House (1968-69), a close colleague of Neilson.\n\nBy the mid-1950s Neilson was considered to be the State\u2019s most promising Labor back-bencher. Following the election in October 1956, he was sworn in as minister for the Tourist and Immigration Department, and also for forestry, in (Sir) Robert Cosgrove\u2019s cabinet. When Eric Reece became premier in August 1958 Neilson was entrusted with the ministry of education; for two months he was also attorney-general. Despite his limited formal schooling, he became a confident and innovative minister of education. Several new high schools were opened and two-year matriculation colleges were introduced. A keen planner, Neilson absorbed information quickly and cultivated interests in Tasmanian history and literature and in the performing arts.\n\nDuring the late 1960s the Reece government lost momentum and popularity and the premier relied heavily on an inner circle of ministers comprising Roy Fagan, Mervyn Everett and Neilson. At its State conference in February 1968 the ALP elected Neilson its president. His first challenge in the post was to argue vigorously against the expulsion of the maverick right-wing union organiser and secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council, Brian Harradine, who had claimed that 'friends of the communists' on the executive were trying to silence him. Minister for education until the government\u2019s defeat at the 1969 election, he resumed the portfolio after the party\u2019s landslide victory in April 1972.\n\nThe next few years witnessed considerable turbulence within the State Labor Party, including a 'revolt' in 1973 by members of Labor Youth of Tasmania. In April 1974 Neilson was elected deputy-premier; relinquishing education, he took on the portfolios of attorney-general, police and licensing, and the environment. When Reece stepped down as premier on 31 March 1975, Neilson was immediately elected to the leadership by caucus, and was strongly endorsed by the outgoing premier. The two likely rival candidates, Neil Batt and Michael Barnard, who had been active in the 'youth rebellion' against Reece, were not given the opportunity to contest the position.\n\nAs premier, Neilson also assumed the treasury and planning and development portfolios. His first year in office was unusually difficult. In addition to having to justify ongoing budget deficits, he was faced with the unresolved Harradine affair and the resulting conflict between the federal and State ALP executives. The government also had to deal with the social consequences of the Tasman Bridge collapse. Neilson was a resident of the eastern shore and among those deprived of easy road access to the city; he regularly joined the morning queue for an improvised and limited ferry service. Highly strung, and susceptible to tension and stomach aliments, Neilson suffered nervous exhaustion through the latter phase of his premiership and in mid-1977 he proposed to cabinet that he vacate office to become Tasmania\u2019s agent-general in London. Stepping down as premier on 1 December, he took up the agent-general\u2019s post in January 1978. That year he was appointed AC.\n\nNeilson\u2019s bass-baritone voice and his attraction to the stage, particularly popular musicals, had offered light relief to the demands of political life, and he sometimes parried colleagues, including the Opposition leader, (Sir) Max Bingham, with cheeky verse and song. At parliament\u2019s farewell dinner for Neilson, Bingham suggested that one of the retiring premier\u2019s signature tunes, 'If I were a rich man', should, in light of his forthcoming agent-general\u2019s salary, become 'Now I am a rich man!'\n\nDuring Neilson\u2019s third year as agent-general, his successor as premier, Douglas Lowe, announced that the London post was proving too expensive to run and would be closed. Neilson publicly challenged the decision, even though his own precarious health made it unlikely that he would serve a second term. Back in Hobart, he became an occasional columnist and theatre reviewer for the Mercury, and retained a close interest in Labor Party affairs and Australian rules football. He also enjoyed reading, chess and playing cards. His last few years were marred by ill health. Survived by his wife and their three daughters and adopted son, he died of cancer on 9 November 1989 at his South Hobart home and was cremated. Although he admitted to no firm religious belief, Neilson had planned the proceedings for his state funeral, held at St David\u2019s Anglican Cathedral on 13 November.\n\nThroughout his thirty-one years as a politician Neilson had been clearly identified as a populist, who retained a close grass-roots connection with his electorate. He enjoyed a broadly based popularity and worked hard to sustain it. Although he entered parliament as a self-styled radical, as a minister he was seldom driven by doctrine. Writing in the Hobart Mercury, a political journalist, Wayne Crawford, credited him with 'innate political adroitness'. In retirement Neilson cited his handling of the education portfolio as his proudest achievement. His portrait, painted by Clifton Pugh in 1978, hangs in Parliament House, Hobart."}, {"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/william-allen-neilson/", "page_content": "William Allan Neilson (28 March 1869 \u2013 1946) was a Scottish-American educator, writer and lexicographer, graduated in the University of Edinburgh in 1891 and became a Ph.D. in Harvard University in 1898.
