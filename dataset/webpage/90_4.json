He had an illustrious career as a journalist before he entered the political realm as a member of Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N). He was appointed information minister by Nawaz Sharif in the latter\u2019s 1997 cabinet.\n\nIn 1999, following the coup by former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf, Mushahid\u2019s house was stormed by soldiers the very same day and he was placed under house arrest and then behind bars. He was released in 2000. Surprisingly, following his release, he defected to Pakistan Muslim League - Quaid (PML-Q), which became known as the \u2018King\u2019s party\u2019 because of its association with Musharraf.\n\nBefore Mushahid decided to experiment with politics, he had a vibrant career in academia as well as journalism. He also trained diplomats at the Pakistan Administrative Staff College, a civil service academy. After this, he taught at Punjab University \u2013 and was dismissed for his opposition to military rule from the institution. In 1982, he was made editor of a daily called \u2018The Muslim\u2019. He has written regularly for the Times of India and The Hindustan Times, along with being published in the New York Times and Washington Post amongst other publications.\n\nIn 1997, Mushahid entered politics and was elected a Senator on a PML-N ticket. He was also made the information minister by Nawaz, and ushered Pakistan through some of its worst international crises \u2013 including the conducting of nuclear tests followed by crippling sanctions and the Kargil War.\n\nPrior to his 1997 cabinet induction, he was an advisor to the then prime minister Nawaz. According to Nawaz, Mushahid was the first person who told him to go ahead with the nuclear tests although this statement has been contested.\n\nAfter his arrest following the 1999 coup, Mushahid remained imprisoned for 440 days and was declared a \u2018Prisoner of Conscience\u2019 by Amnesty International. He was imprisoned by the military government for his connections with Nawaz, and was held in solitary confinement for a part of this time.\n\nEventually, he contested the 2003 Senate election on a PML-Q ticket and won \u2013 reportedly with a letter of recommendation from Washington. Mushahid also become a staunch supporter of Musharraf and even agreed with the latter\u2019s decision to not shed his uniform.\n\nIn 2004, he was part of a team that negotiated with slain Baloch nationalist leader Akbar Bugti.

The other path is conflict and confrontation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Mushahid Hussain Syed, the world can no longer afford conflicts, a new Cold War, or any policies of containment. \u201cLet us build a better peaceful prosperous future together because the challenges acquire collective approach. Cold War is not on the agenda especially of the developing countries,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Wang Wen from Chongyang Institute, Renmin University of China talked about China\u2019s rise amidst the new cold war-challenges and opportunities in the post-pandemic world. \u201cI believe that the US has adopted a new cold war approach to contain and suppress China without a bottom-line, honestly. China was forced to fight back. If the United States does not stop those behaviors and the cold war really occurs, the whole world will suffer,\u201d said Mr. Wang Wen.\n\n\n\n\n\nMustafa Hyder Sayed, Executive Director PCI said, \u201cCountries like Pakistan have to learn how to balance their strategic partnerships and at the same time prioritize our food and economic security\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeith Bennet, Co-Editor Friends of Socialist China, said that China is a role model for countries that wish to build their economies. \u201cOn economic front, China\u2019s BRI is the greatest investment infrastructure program and opportunity in history, holds up the possibility of development of the national economy and holds connectivity and improvement of peoples living standard in countries across the globe,\u201d Mr. Bennet said.\n\n\n\n\n\nYara Suos, MP Member Kingdom of Cambodia explained that Cambodia and its people highly value BRI and China\u2019s strategic partnership in the region.\n\n\n\n"}, {"url": "https://senate.gov.pk/en/news_content.php?id=4555", "page_content": "News Detail\n\nEvent Title: Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Defence Presiding over a Meeting of the Committee at Parliament Lodges Islamabad Event Date: 2022-09-23\n\nSenate Defence Committee under the Chairman, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, received a comprehensive briefing on the security situation in Swat in the backdrop of reports of resurgence of TTP and the attacks which are taking place on civilians and soldiers. The committee was assured that the writ of the state is paramount and the law and order situation is under control. There have been incidents but the culprits have been traced and caught. Special appreciation was expressed for the role of CTD Malakand whose police force, levies and paramilitary have played a heroic role to preserve, protect and promote peace as well as the lives of the local people.\n\n\n\nThere was a candid exchange of views between the members of the committee on this issue. The Committee was of the consensus view that there should not be any appeasement or compromise on upholding the rule of law. All those committing crimes against the people and the state must be caught, tried in court and given due punishment as per the law.\n\n\n\nThe Committee also received a briefing from the Director General, Federal Government Educational Institution on the functioning of the department which has 386 schools, spread over 66 cities of Pakistan in all provinces. The committee expressed its appreciation and the positive role that the department is playing to promote national integration through education and resolved that its meagre budget needs to be raised and bring at par with the Federal Directorate of Education. The committee also supported the proposal of establishment of National University of Pakistan and Institute of Inclusive Education.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the outset, Senator Mushahid Hussain extended a warm welcome to the new Secretary Defence, Lt. Gen. Hamood uz Zaman and appreciated his services as head of the NCOC which was primarily responsible for containing of corona virus in a very successful manner. Senator Mushahid Hussain also said that the Committee which represents all political parties, both government and opposition and all provinces has always worked as a bridge between the armed forces and parliament and on national security issues, the committee speaks above party lines in a unified manner. Moreover, on issues of national security, the Senate Defence Committee will continue to play its the role with unity, vigor and determination.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://thediplomat.com/2022/03/what-is-driving-pakistans-outreach-to-russia/", "page_content": "Advertisement\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s visit to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin amid the Ukraine crisis came under great scrutiny. Many political analysts questioned the timing of the visit, as it presumably gave the wrong signals about where Pakistan stood diplomatically in the Russia-versus-West confrontation. A dominant theme running in the print and electronic media in Pakistan was that Khan\u2019s visit was planned months in advance, that it was for concluding the negotiations over gas pipeline construction, and that it had nothing to do with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn fact, Pakistan did not visit Russia specifically for negotiations over the construction of a $2.5 billion, 1,100-kilometer gas pipeline from Karachi in Pakistan\u2019s south to Lahore in the center of Punjab province. There were no conclusive details on the agreement in the post-visit press release. The pipeline already suffers from bureaucratic wrangling and arguments over who should assume responsibility in case the construction is delayed or faces complications from the uncertain future of imported hydrocarbons in Pakistan. Further, the gas pipeline has dim prospects of ever being constructed now, let alone operationalized, given the West\u2019s extensive sanctions on Russia. Pakistan\u2019s gas pipeline agreement with Iran is also in limbo for similar reasons.\n\nTo say the least, energy cooperation does not represent the flagship area for Pakistan-Russia ties, despite how the Khan visit was framed in media reports. So what is driving Pakistan\u2019s approach to Russia?\n\nPakistan\u2019s Stance on the Ukraine War\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get briefed on the story of the week, and developing stories to watch across the Asia-Pacific. Get the Newsletter\n\nAfter the visit, Pakistan\u2019s stance at the international forums suggested neutrality in the Russia-Ukraine war. Abstaining from the U.N. General Assembly draft resolution condemning Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine, Pakistan maintained that endorsing the resolution would close the doors to diplomacy. In an earlier press release of the Khan-Putin meeting, Pakistan had urged for a negotiated settlement to the military conflict.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nRecently, Khan launched a verbal offensive against the European Union ambassadors in Islamabad, as they had urged Pakistan through a public statement to denounce Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Khan said that Pakistan was not a slave to follow orders from any country. This reaction was an extension of Khan\u2019s earlier instances of resistance against the U.S.-led drone campaign in Pakistan and Washington\u2019s with-us-or-against-us diktat. Khan instead questioned the West\u2019s position on India\u2019s human rights violations in its administered part of Kashmir.\n\nPolitical analysts with close links to a wider strategic community in Islamabad remarked that the notion of the West\u2019s dual standards has a \u201cgenuine appeal\u201d across the political spectrum in Islamabad. That is, political opponents and the media community in Islamabad largely agreed with the substance of Khan\u2019s comments, though they differed on the tone and means of conveying the message. They also condemned Khan\u2019s public ridicule of strong economic and strategic partners in Europe and North America.\n\nGiven this background, how should we understand Pakistan\u2019s neutrality in Russia\u2019s ongoing confrontation with the West? I asked Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, a former chairperson of the Pakistan Senate\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee, to explain this. He listed Pakistan\u2019s recent actions that were self-explanatory in that regard: Pakistan\u2019s refusal to join the U.S.-led Summit for Democracies; participation in the Opening Ceremony of the Olympics in Beijing; and then the Moscow visit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese actions may reflect a tilt away from the West, but frankly speaking, Pakistan pursues narrow strategic, security, and economic interests. It does not matter much for the country if it is getting support for its interests from the U.S., Europe, China, Russia, or the Middle East.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Eurasian Interests\n\nPakistan\u2019s refusal to join the democracy summit and Khan\u2019s subsequent visits to Beijing and Moscow do not suggest a shift away from the liberal order and an embrace of autocratic regimes. Nor does it mean that Islamabad would pursue anti-West and pro-Russia/China policies. It only means that after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pakistan understands that Washington will pursue a strategy that focuses on China as a primary strategic threat and the Indo-Pacific region as a primary theater of engagement. With the exit of the United States from its immediate region, Pakistan wants to increase its engagement with other major powers that have major sway in the security and economy of the South and Central Asian region.\n\nPakistan, like any of its neighboring countries, is operating under this overarching architecture of Eurasia, where the Russo-Chinese \u201caxis of convenience\u201d or \u201cmodus vivendi\u201d aims to exclude the United States from their sphere of influence in Eurasia. Pakistan seeks to work with Beijing and Moscow to ensure its security interests more or less the same way it did with the U.S. during the alliance periods to secure its objectives.\n\nThis new geopolitical reality is one of the predominant reasons for Pakistan\u2019s new outreach to Russia. Pakistan has lately observed Russia\u2019s important role as the sole arbiter in the Nagorno-Karabakh issue and the intervention of Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) forces in Kazakhstan, which ensured the survival of the country\u2019s incumbent government. These events provided strong evidence that Russia is the ultimate guarantor of Eurasian security.\n\nPakistan\u2019s geoeconomic vision and the Vision Central Asia could therefore hinge to a great extent to Russia\u2019s blessings, just as Moscow\u2019s political and security guardianship is helping China\u2019s economic inroads in the region. Without Russia\u2019s backing, Pakistan would find it hard, if not impossible, to work with the Central Asian Republics for inter-regional connectivity and trade projects.\n\nBesides, Pakistan and Russia share an interest in promoting an inclusive government in Kabul. Pakistan could possibly be asking Russia to reason with the Central Asian leaders (and Iran) to cease supporting various political factions in Afghanistan in ways that can lead to a civil war. In exchange, Pakistan would push the Taliban for a power-sharing government with non-Pashtun factions.\n\nEnjoying this article? Click here to subscribe for full access. Just $5 a month.\n\nMoreover, Russia, just like China, is against the rise of political Islam in Eurasia, and Pakistan would also like to balance the Taliban\u2019s power with that of other ethnic elements to keep the Taliban and their political ideology restrained. Pakistan would also be willing to work with Russia, China, and other Eurasian countries toward defeating terrorism in the region, including under the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).\n\nRussia\u2019s strong relations with India used to be an irritant in Pakistan-Russia ties. But since at least 2010, when New Delhi diversified its foreign arms acquisitions and reduced Russia\u2019s relative share in Indian defense imports, Moscow has tried reaching out to other defense markets. In 2014, for the first time in the history of Moscow-Islamabad ties, Russia lifted its self-imposed embargo on arms sales to Pakistan and did not take India\u2019s objections into account. In 2016, Russia conducted joint friendship exercises for the first time in Pakistan\u2019s northern areas, again ignoring India\u2019s objections.\n\nPakistan also noted an opening in Moscow\u2019s stance in 2017 when the country\u2019s ambassador in Islamabad endorsed Pakistan\u2019s case for a criteria-based membership in the Nuclear Supplier Group (NSG). It did not resonate with New Delhi\u2019s position for merit-based membership in the nuclear export control group of 48 nations. Pakistan also received four Mi-35 helicopters worth $153 million in 2017 as part of a 2015 defense sales agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this signifies that Pakistan is creating strategic, diplomatic, and economic space in its ties with Russia. This newfound opening can reinforce Pakistan\u2019s geoeconomic vision of South and Central Asian economic integration, bring about a convergence of interests in Afghanistan against terrorism and radical ideology, and act as a moderator on India\u2019s alleged military assertiveness toward Pakistan."}, {"url": "https://www.dawn.com/news/1757548", "page_content": "ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights on Friday sought from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs details of Pakistani prisoners abroad, including the four detainees and their report of release from Guantanamo prison in a chronological order.\n\nThe committee was apprised that two detainees (Rabbani brothers), and Majid Khan were released in February 2023. The Rabbani brothers were repatriated to Pakistan as free citizens.\n\nExpressing concern over the harassment of Pakistani women in the American non-governmental organisation (NGO) working in the health sector in Pakistan, members remarked that if such incidents had happened in the United States, there would not have been silence.\n\nThe committee recommended to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Economic Affairs that all private and public institutions should form an Internal Harassment Committee.\n\nRecommends public, private institutions to form harassment committees\n\nThe meeting was held at the Parliament House under the chairmanship of Senator Walid Iqbal. Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi, Abida Azeem, Falak Naaz Chitrali, Dr Humayun and Senator Seemee Ezdi were present in the meeting. Federal secretary for human rights, foreign ministry officials, and other officials concerned also attended the meeting.\n\nMinistry officials told the committee that one of the prisoners, who was held in Guantanamo had reached Pakistan on Feb 24, 2023, and was in Karachi.\n\nSenator Seemee Ezdi said that he had been in jail for 21 years without charges. Senator Humayun Mohmand said that it was a shame that until the senator raised this issue, the government abandoned its citizens and no one asked about it. Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed said that in 2008, he took a delegation to the US and went to meet Aafia Siddiqui. It was also highlighted that $1.2 million from the government was consumed for the lawyer in Aafia\u2019s case.\n\nSenator Waqar Mehdi said that the Rabbani brothers should be called to the committee to tell their story. The committee was apprised that Majid Khan had not come to Pakistan. He was imprisoned for 19 years but had now been released, however he did not return to Pakistan.\n\nOfficials of the foreign ministry told the committee that the US embassy had highlighted that there was no longer any Pakistani in Guantanamo Bay. Mr Syed questioned what the citizenship of Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, who was arrested in Karachi, was.\n\nPakistan had never demanded compensation for the loss of life to it as a result of war from North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), Mr Syed said.\n\nThe issue of sexual harassment of female employees of an NGO was taken into consideration. Chairman of the committee Walid Iqbal said that the law to protect women from workplace harassment in Pakistan had been in place since 2010. Many female employees of the NGO had complained about sexual harassment. So far, five women had filed a written complaint against the NGO. The committee learnt that harassment had been going on in this NGO for five to seven years and complaints to the administration had been in vain.\n\nThe head of the NGO in Pakistan presented his position in front of the committee and said that now the harassment committee had been established. It was observed that not forming the committee was a violation of the Harassment Act.\n\nThe standing committee passed a resolution condemning the incidents of May 9.\n\nThe resolution stated that the committee condemned the attacks on military and civilian installations on May 9. It was further highlighted that strong defence institutions were part of a strong democratic system and action should be taken against the people involved in violence. It was resolved that according to international agreements, these people should be given the right to a transparent trial.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 3rd, 2023"}]}
