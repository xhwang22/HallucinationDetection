Nodar Kumaritashvili had dreams of hearing it on the podium when he came to compete in the 2010 Olympics. But just hours before the Feb. 12 opening ceremony, the 21-year-old luger died during a practice run at the Whistler Sliding Centre.\n\n\"He was a young, talented, ambitious sportsman. He came to Whistler to become a champion,\" said Konstantin Kavtaradze, Georgia\u2019s ambassador to Canada. Kavtaradze was among dozens who joined a memorial march through Whistler Village on the tenth anniversary of the young athlete\u2019s death.\n\n\"We are gathered today to remember. Remember that tragic day that happened 10 years ago today and affected thousands and thousands of people, not just in Canada and Georgia but across the world and left huge sorrow and pity in their hearts. But we are here also to celebrate. Celebrate the life of Nodar Kumaritashvili,\" said Kavtaradze.\n\nTerrance Kosikar took part in the memorial. He was one of several first responders who tried to save Kumaritashvili after his sled hit a pole.\n\n\"This event is very special to me because Nodar was my patient. I want to honour his life today,\" said Kosikar. \"Because Nodar\u2019s family asked that the world remember their son, it\u2019s the only one thing that gives them peace, so for them to be able to see this today in Georgia, for them to understand and know that the world does remember their son? That\u2019s a win-win.\"\n\nKumaritashvili wasn\u2019t able to stand on the podium in 2010, but Kavtaradze said his family does have a medal from the games.\n\n\"One Austrian luger who won melted down his Olympic medal that he won here in Whistler and made two medals of it. And one of it he shared with Nodar's family. So despite the fact he tragically died here, he became a champion,\" said Kavtaradze.\n\nKumaritashvili\u2019s parents are hoping to one day visit Whistler to honour their son. Until then, Kavtaradze says they appreciate Canadians remembering him so long after the games.\n\n\"Ten years after the tragedy happened, so many people are gathered here, so many people are paying respect to this young Georgian guy,\" said Kavtaradze. \"Thank you, Canada.

His sled swooped out from under him and he rocketed through the air, turning backward as he launched into a thick metal pillar that supports the canopy above the finish area.\n\nThere was a collective gasp on the finish dock from officials and athletes as the crash was beamed on the large-screen TVs. The screens were immediately turned off as crews raced to Kumaritashvili.\n\nMedics were seen performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the Georgian, his helmet still on, face up on the concrete beside the track and the ambulance. Track officials then ordered all bystanders away.\n\nMedics administered CPR to the bloodied Kumaritashvili before he was loaded into an ambulance. An air-rescue helicopter arrived eight minutes after the crash and the slider was taken to a medical facility at the athletes' village south of Whistler.\n\nVideo of the crash was posted on YouTube \u2014 but was quickly removed.\n\nAlpine skier Brad Spence of Calgary wrote on Twitter: \"My thoughts and condolences go out to the family and friends of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili. What a tragedy.\"\n\nKumaritashvili was a relatively inexperienced luger. He had competed in five World Cup races this season, finishing 44th in the world standings.\n\nIt was his second crash during training for the Vancouver Games. He also failed to finish his second of his six practice runs.\n\n\"Half the time in luge, people are shaking their heads and saying, 'You're heading down this track, feet first, in something you can't really steer \u2014 isn't that crazy?' But in kind of a funny way. And now you realize there's a huge degree of skill and risk involved,\" said Pound.\n\nConcerns over sliding track\n\n\"This is the first time we've seen this. It's very sad,\" said Canadian luge team coach Wolfgang Staudinger, who was in the finish area. He said he planned to meet with his team to discuss what happened.\n\nThe $105-million sliding centre, on the southeast face of Blackcomb Mountain, has been billed as a wild ride and the crash happened at its fastest point.\n\nThe 1,450-metre course has 16 turns and drops steeply for 152 metres, the longest drop of any track in the world.

You never want to see something like that happen,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I was never in a mindset that I wouldn\u2019t compete. I was comfortable on the track.\u201d\n\nThe same mentality appears to be true of Saba.\n\nMs Hamlin added: \u201cThere\u2019s risks every time you slide. I was never fearful about continuing to slide.\n\n\u201cThe track was definitely fast and challenging but it was new and most new tracks are challenging to figure out and come with risk. I enjoyed the track quite a bit.\u201d\n\nQuestions were instantly raised after Nodar\u2019s death about the safety of the track.\n\nThe Whistler course was the fastest track in Olympic history and speeds of 96 miles per hour had been recorded ahead of the Games.\n\nThe 16th curve where Nodar had flown off the track had earned the nickname the \u201cThunderbird\u201d.\n\nDavid revealed that his son had told him just three days before his death that he was \u201cvery scared\u201d of the turn where he flipped off the sled.\n\n\u201cDad, I\u2019m very scared of this spot on the track,\u201d he recalled to ABC News .\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very fast.

She won bronze four years later in Sochi.\n\nShe told The Independent that Nodar\u2019s death did lead to changes in the sport in terms of focusing on safety over speed.\n\n\u201cI think it was a movement where everyone stopped to look at ways we could try to see if it was possible to make the track safer,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much that could be done other than moving the starts as it was kind of a freak accident.\n\n\u201cBut the trend of just building faster and faster tracks did change.\u201d\n\nNodar\u2019s sled is seen just after the fatal crash. It crossed the finish line moments after he was killed (AP)\n\nFor Saba, he feels he is now ready to represent his family - particularly his cousin - in Beijing.\n\n\u201cI worked hard and believed in myself strongly,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNow I feel happy and satisfied that I\u2019ve achieved one of my goals\u2026 I think every sportsman\u2019s goal and dream is to be competing in the Olympic Games, so two years ago I decided to achieve this goal. And here I am.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI am happy and proud that I have the opportunity to represent my family and country at these Olympics.\n\n\u201cNow I feel responsibility to them, because they expect good results from me.

Access to the crash area was closed within about 30 minutes.\n\n\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Shiva Keshavan, a four-time Olympian from India.\n\n\n\nThe remainder of men's training was canceled for the day, with VANOC officials saying in a release that an investigation was taking place to \"ensure a safe field of play.\"\n\n\n\nKumaritashvili competed in five World Cup races this season, finishing 44th in the world standings.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the day, gold-medal favorite Armin Zoeggeler of Italy crashed, losing control of his sled on Curve 11. Zoeggeler came off his sled and held it with his left arm to keep it from smashing atop his body. He slid on his back down several curves before coming to a stop and walking away.\n\n\n\nTraining days in Whistler have been crash-filled. A Romanian woman was briefly knocked unconscious and at least four Americans \u2014 Chris Mazdzer on Wednesday, Megan Sweeney on Thursday and both Tony Benshoof and Bengt Walden on Friday in the same training session where Zoeggeler wrecked \u2014 have had serious trouble just getting down the track.\n\n\n\n\"I think they are pushing it a little too much,\" Australia's Hannah Campbell-Pegg said Thursday night after she nearly lost control in training. \"To what extent are we just little lemmings that they just throw down a track and we're crash-test dummies? I mean, this is our lives.\"\n\n\n\nAt the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, Nicholas Bochatay of Switzerland died after crashing into a snow grooming machine during training for the demonstration sport of speed skiing on the next-to-last day of the games. He was practicing on a public slope before his event was to begin.\n\n\n\nAustrian downhill skier Ross Milne died when he struck a tree during a training run shortly before the 1964 Winter Games in Innsbruck, Austria. British luger Kazimierz Kay-Skrzypecki also died in a crash during training in Innsbruck.\n\n\n\nAt the 1988 Calgary Games, an Austrian team doctor, Jorg Oberhammer, died after being hit by a snow grooming machine.\n\n\n\n\u223cNodar Kumaritashvili was born in Borjomi, then a part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\nHe finished 55th in the 2008\u201309 Luge World Cup.\n\n\n\nKumaritashvili finished 28th of 32 competitors in the 2009\u201310 Luge World Cup Cesana Pariol event in January, which was his last World Cup event. His father, Selix, is the head of the Georgian Luge Federation.\n\n\n\nOn February 12, 2010, Kumaritashvili was fatally injured in an accident during a training run at the Whistler Sliding Centre when, coming out of turn 15 too late he was unable to compensate for turn 16 and lost control of his luge and was thrown off and over the protective wall on the side of the track, striking a steel support beam at the end of the run. He was travelling approximately 89.0 mph at the moment of the incident.\n\n\n\nMedics were at his side within seconds of the crash and began CPR within one minute. He was airlifted to a Whistler hospital, where he was eventually pronounced dead. It was also luge's first fatality since 10 December 1975 when an Italian luger was killed."}, {"url": "https://www.zimbio.com/Nodar+Kumaritashvili/articles/3AOD1VoIb7Z/Report+Nodar+Kumaritashvili+Dies+Luge+Crash", "page_content": "Nodar Kumaritashvili of Georgia during the second Men's Single Luge training run at the Whistler Sliding Centre ahead of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics on February 10, 2010 in Whistler, Canada.
