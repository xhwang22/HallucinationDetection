It has given our older generation the chance to reminisce while younger supporters will enter new territory. It is another positive message about the club.\"\n\nDean Henderson was the penalty shootout hero as Cooper's side overcame Wolves at the City Ground.\n\nHenderson turned away Ruben Neves' spot-kick after Jose Sa had denied Sam Surridge, then turned away Joe Hodge's effort following Forest converting all four of their remaining penalties.\n\nForest had led in normal time when former Wolves pair Morgan Gibbs-White and Willy Boly combined, with Gibbs-White hanging an excellent first-half corner into the six-yard box and Boly stabbing home from close range.\n\nWolves scored a superb equaliser when new loan signing Matheus Cunha's low cross invited the finish from striker Raul Jimenez.\n\nThe game ended with ugly scenes in the centre of the pitch, with stewards involved to pull the players apart as tempers frayed.\n\nForest will host Manchester United first in the two-legged semi-final. The games will be played in the weeks commencing 23 and 30 January.\n\nHowever, Forest will likely be without Henderson, who is on loan from Manchester United.\n\n\"I have only just thought of that, it is frustrating,\" Cooper said of Henderson's ineligibility.\n\n\"After seeing the night he had tonight, he was excellent in the penalty shootout, but he was good in the game, more than good in the game.\n\n\"It's unfortunate. He's part of our group, he is so invested in the group and how we work, what we're trying to accelerate in terms of what we want to become.\n\n\"To do that you need a really good goalkeeper. Not only is he committing as a goalkeeper, he is buying into being in the city and the greater good of the club.\n\n\"It has put a dampener on it for me tonight.\"\n\nBoly doesn't celebrate rare goal\n\nFormer Wolves defender Willy Boly had given Nottingham Forest a first-half lead\n\nIt has become accepted that players do not celebrate goals against their former clubs, a tradition which Boly upheld despite his effort being his first for Forest.\n\nIt did seem a little bit strange.\n\nAfter all, the Ivory Coast defender did actively request a move away from Molineux in the summer, having received a substantial offer from Forest.\n\nIn addition, scoring is a rare experience for the 31-year-old. He last found the net almost two years ago, in Wolves' home defeat by West Brom. It was one of only six he scored in five seasons with the club.\n\nSadly for Boly, his evening ended early. Although he tried to continue after getting hurt in a clash with Hwang Hee-chan, he quickly signalled it was impossible.\n\nA mounting injury list is one of the reasons Cooper has cited for Forest's need to enter the transfer market this month.\n\nAnd now Forest have two more games to play this month, that need is even more acute.\n\nNot that such issues were bothering the home fans as they celebrated victory and a semi-final appearance to come in a competition legendary former boss Brian Clough won four times during his illustrious stint with the club.\n\nWolves a greater goal threat\n\nWolves fans have adapted a chant usually heard at Arsenal, singing about manager Julen Lopetegui \"he knows exactly what we need\".\n\nIn fairness, it wasn't anything revelatory. Wolves were shocking at scoring goals before the World Cup break.\n\nAlthough Cunha's January arrival will not on its own solve the problem, even without the currently injured Diego Costa Wolves look a far greater threat.\n\nHenderson made two excellent saves at the end of the first half to deny Jimenez - Goncalo Guedes should have threatened with the rebound but blazed over - and Hwang.\n\nJimenez's equaliser was the end product of slick team play from the visitors, which included a telling contribution from Neves to allow Cunha to deliver the decisive low cross.\n\nIt was Wolves' eighth goal in six games since Lopetegui took charge. It had taken Wolves 13 games to get their previous eight, part of a woeful overall pre-World Cup tally of 11.\n\nHenderson was to have the final word though as Wolves missed out on what would have been their first last-four appearance in this competition since winning it in 1980.\n\nPlayer of the match Matheus Cunha Matheus Cunha with an average of 7.19 Nottm Forest Nottingham Forest Nottingham Forest\n\nWolves Wolverhampton Wanderers Wolverhampton Wanderers Nottingham Forest Avg Squad number 1 Player name Henderson Average rating 7.07 Squad number 30 Player name Boly Average rating 7.01 Squad number 20 Player name Johnson Average rating 6.78 Squad number 22 Player name Yates Average rating 6.75 Squad number 10 Player name Gibbs-White Average rating 6.73 Squad number 32 Player name Renan Lodi Average rating 6.48 Squad number 24 Player name Aurier Average rating 6.46 Squad number 31 Player name Gustavo Scarpa Average rating 6.44 Squad number 4 Player name Worrall Average rating 6.42 Squad number 23 Player name Freuler Average rating 6.35 Squad number 5 Player name Mangala Average rating 6.24 Squad number 26 Player name McKenna Average rating 6.19 Squad number 8 Player name Colback Average rating 6.10 Squad number 16 Player name Surridge Average rating 5.80 Squad number 25 Player name Dennis Average rating 5.68 Wolverhampton Wanderers Avg Squad number 12 Player name Matheus Cunha Average rating 7.19 Squad number 37 Player name Traor\u00e9 Average rating 6.58 Squad number 10 Player name Daniel Podence Average rating 6.42 Squad number 9 Player name Jim\u00e9nez Average rating 6.32 Squad number 59 Player name Hodge Average rating 6.32 Squad number 8 Player name R\u00faben Neves Average rating 6.12 Squad number 27 Player name Matheus Nunes Average rating 5.88 Squad number 11 Player name Hwang Hee-chan Average rating 5.80 Squad number 3 Player name A\u00eft-Nouri Average rating 5.78 Squad number 1 Player name Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 Average rating 5.78 Squad number 24 Player name Toti Average rating 5.72 Squad number 28 Player name Jo\u00e3o Moutinho Average rating 5.66 Squad number 22 Player name N\u00e9lson Semedo Average rating 5.61 Squad number 23 Player name Kilman Average rating 5.61 Squad number 17 Player name Gon\u00e7alo Guedes Average rating 5.58 Squad number 19 Player name Jonny Average rating 5.49"}, {"url": "https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-cooper-fa-charge-7746165", "page_content": "Nottingham Forest boss Steve Cooper has been charged by the Football Association over alleged \u201cimproper conduct\u201d.\n\nThe Welshman\u2019s comments about referee Thomas Bramall after his team\u2019s 1-0 defeat at Wolverhampton Wanderers earlier this month are said to \u201cimply bias and/or question the integrity of the referee and/or bring the game into disrepute\u201d.

The fact of the matter is they\u2019ve had one (penalty) and scored, and we\u2019ve had one and missed.\n\n\u201cMy focus really is on the performance. We were decent enough without the ball in the first half, but we were nowhere near good enough with the ball - turned it over too easily and didn\u2019t make enough passes when there was a real opportunity to do that against how Wolves set up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where my real annoyance is, in terms of today. We talked about it at half-time, about how defensively we looked solid enough. I know they had territory and possession, but we talked about if they were going to break through it was going to be down the sides, so we had to deal with the crosses - I thought we did that well, which was part of the plan.\n\n\u201cWhat we didn\u2019t do was look after the ball well enough, be brave enough and be creative enough when we got it. The message at half-time was to keep going with the defending but improve with the ball. Unfortunately, it\u2019s taken us going 1-0 down for us to start playing, to start getting up the pitch and start looking like we could threaten on their goal.\n\n\u201cWe had decent moments with set-pieces, and with the penalty and Yatesy\u2019s header, but we\u2019ve not managed to take them. The result is the frustrating bit and the most disappointing bit, but I try to analyse the performance as well - and some of the first half in-possession stuff wasn\u2019t what it should be.\u201d\n\nAsked if he felt the visitors should have had a penalty from Williams\u2019 effort, Cooper said: \u201cWe know the ref well from last year, particularly when you get him at home.

But the game was overshadowed by a touchline melee at the start of the second half and a VAR intervention to check whether Podence had spat at Johnson in the closing stages.\n\nForest assistant Alan Tate and Wolves counterpart Pablo Sanz were both sent off by referee Chris Kavanagh after the official had waved away Wolves\u2019 appeals for a penalty when Adama Traore went tumbling at the start of the second half.
