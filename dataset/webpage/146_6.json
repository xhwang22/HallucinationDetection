One of Mackie\u2019s flashiest outfits for Turner featured pleated lam\u00e9 wings and fringe that had to be constructed from chain because he knew beaded trimming would fall apart after a few of Turner\u2019s notoriously kinetic shows. When she dashed across the stage in 1977, the wings fanned out behind her. \u201cI looked like I was about to take flight and soar \u2014 which was exactly how I felt about being on my own for the first time,\u201d she wrote in her memoir That\u2019s My Life.\n\nExpand Photo In 1977, wearing a suit.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Harry Langdon/Getty Images\n\nExpand Photo In 1978 at her first solo concert in London since splitting up with her partner, Ike, Turner debuted a noticeably more liberated look, setting the ton... more In 1978 at her first solo concert in London since splitting up with her partner, Ike, Turner debuted a noticeably more liberated look, setting the tone for her style in later years.

They became part of the rock and punk scenes, performing for audiences consisting of other children of Holocaust survivors. However, many of these performers, and the generation that followed them, were known more as women artists than as Jewish artists.\n\nThe first all-female rock band to be signed to a major label was Goldie and the Gingerbreads, led by Goldie Zelkowitz (Genyusha Zelkowicz, b. 1940). Born in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland, Zelkowitz had survived both the Holocaust and the DP camps as a small child before immigrating to New York. As a teenager, she rebelled by seeking out danger and countercultural expression. Zelkowitz formed Goldie and the Gingerbreads in 1962. The band was signed to Decca in 1963, and then to Atlantic in 1964. Goldie and the Gingerbreads lasted until 1967.\n\nZelkowitz went on to form the band Ten Wheel Drive in 1968, changing her stage name to Genya Ravan and working increasingly as a solo artist after 1974. Around the same time, she began to work as a record producer, becoming the first woman to produce major male bands. She worked for several major labels, including Sire Records, Polydor, and her own label, Polish Records.\n\nHelen Wheels (Helen Robbins, 1949 \u2013 2000) made a name for herself in punk during the same era when Ravan was working in rock. Wheels was the Reform Jewish daughter of a housewife who later became a feminist. In 1967, as a student at CUNY, she met Albert Bouchard and began to design costumes for his band Soft White Underbelly, which became Blue \u00d6yster Cult in 1971. Wheels also contributed lyrics to five of the group\u2019s records, earning two gold albums and one platinum album. Her own punk band, called the Helen Wheels Band, performed largely on the East Coast of the United States between 1977 and 1987. She won the ASCAP award for Best New Writer and Publisher in 1978, and in 1986 the Helen Wheels Band was nominated for \u201cBest Heavy Metal Band\u201d in the inaugural New York City Music Awards. Wheels took up bodybuilding in 1981 and established a small-press imprint, Fort Tryon Press Ltd., in 1995.\n\nAlthough Ravan and Wheels were not overwhelmingly successful as performers, they opened space for other Jewish women to perform in rock and punk. The space they created was largely one of outsiderness. Many Jewish rock and punk artists either did not highlight or actively downplayed their Jewishness, and indeed a strong thread of antisemitism characterized the punk scene of the 1980s and 1990s. A powerful culture of sexism existed, too, and women musicians responded to this sexism through the Riot Grrrl movement.\n\nRiot Grrrl began in the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s. The movement blended female anger and the fight against male-dominated power structures with a playful approach to the signs and signals of femininity and a do-it-yourself aesthetic inherited from punk. Although Jewish women, including Carrie Brownstein (b. 1974) and Janet Weiss (b. 1965) of the band Sleater-Kinney, and women of at least partial Jewish descent, including Courtney Love (b. 1964), participated in Riot Grrrl bands, the movement was primarily concerned with feminism rather than Jewishness.\n\nMore recently, the New York-based rock band The Shondes, founded in 2006, has blended Riot Grrrl-influenced feminist punk with Jewish political and cultural statements and LGBT perspectives. Its lead singer and bassist, Louisa Rachel Solomon (b. 1982), former drummer Temim Fruchter (b. 1979), and other largely Jewish and LGBT musicians combined punk and klezmer elements and played for organizations that upheld their political advocacy for peace through justice between Palestine and Israel. The Shondes\u2019 radical political activism has caused controversy with Jewish audiences. However, many Jewish radical arts organizations and news outlets have praised the group\u2019s musical achievements in bringing an audible sense of Jewish cultural identity to Riot Grrrl-style pop music.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the most notable Jewish female performer was singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse (1983 \u2013 2011). Winehouse\u2019s music blended soul with rhythm and blues, and she was known for her contralto voice and beehive hairstyle. Although much of her work was in live performance, she produced two albums. Her 2003 debut album, Frank, was nominated for a Mercury Prize, and her 2006 album Back to Black won five Grammy Awards in 2008. Winehouse also won three Ivor Novello awards, of which she was particularly proud, and the 2007 Brit Award for Best British Female Artist. Like her American counterparts, Winehouse\u2019s Jewish identity played almost no role in her musical performance; although she sometimes performed wearing a large Magen David medallion, she was not religiously observant, occasionally attending her family\u2019s Passover seder and going to the synagogue once a year, at Yom Kippur. Nevertheless, two years after her death, the Jewish Museum in London staged an exhibition about Winehouse that has bolstered her posthumous identity as a Jewish popular musician."}, {"url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong", "page_content": "http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureSong\n\nThis is a music trope for the (usually) one song by an artist that everyone knows. It doesn't matter how people know the song \u2014 maybe it was all over the radio, maybe it was used in a movie, maybe it was used in a TV show, maybe it was used for an ad that got played over and over and over again \u2014 but people know it.\n\nThese songs tend to be songs with an Epic Riff; they can also be Black Sheep Hits. It's also possible for an artist to have more than one Signature Song, especially one for two or more distinct phases of their career. Whatever the case, these songs are very likely to be awesome.\n\nSome of the more rabid members of the artist's fandom may accuse one of not being a true fan for disliking the artist's Signature Song, even if said person may like every other song that the artist has recorded \u2014 or, inversely, liking the Signature Song more than what Fanon considers the artist's \"real best work\".\n\nSometimes the signature song isn't the artist's biggest hit (see Chart Displacement). It also doesn't necessarily run in line with their Signature Style (see Black Sheep Hit).\n\nThe song can also be famous due to its inclusion in a certain work. The songs that are potholed are examples of these.\n\nIf they made an appearance in Guitar Hero or Rock Band, it's probably this song. If the artist was a composer of Classical Music, the song is probably a Standard Snippet now.\n\nIn earlier times, such as the 1930s and 1940s, it was not uncommon for a band or singer to open their set with their signature song or at least a few bars of it, especially when they appeared on radio. With the advent of television talk shows, it also became common for the studio band to play a few bars from the artist's signature song as he or she walked onstage.\n\nTo stop people from leaving at gigs after they've heard the song,note as what happened a lot to Radiohead with their song \"Creep\" from Pablo Honey before they developed a larger fandom these songs are normally played live either at the end of the main set or during the encore. Not performing it at all may result in an Iconic Song Request. Some artists or bands will actually avert playing their signature at all. Be it because they consider it an Old Shame, a target of Misaimed Fandom, because they would rather try out some deep cuts on that tour, or any other reason.\n\nSome musicians arguably avert this by having several equally famous hit songs; The Beatles, Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley being three prominent examples. As such, if they'd left off one of their hits from a show it wouldn't have been such an obvious oversight. That said, certainly some of their songs are more identified with them than others. A Black Sheep Hit is somewhat more likely to fall victim to this, for obvious reasons.\n\nOccasionally, an artist can have a signature song that is eventually usurped by another song (although this could be temporary). It's also possible for an artist to have different signature songs in different countries. Additionally, one could have different signatures songs for different audiences. Though a rare occurrence, it's possible for two different artists to have the same signature song.\n\nSignature songs may be slightly different from region to region, as well.\n\nSee One-Hit Wonder for an extreme case of this trope. Not to be confused with Leitmotif or Character Signature Song, which is about signature songs sang by fictional characters.\n\n<!\u2014index\u2014>\n\n!\u2014/index\u2014>\n\nopen/close all folders\n\nAdvertising\n\nSix Flags \u2014 Vengaboys' \"We Like to Party\" has become synonymous with the franchise due to its usage in the memorable and highly memetic \"It's Playtime\" commercial from 2004.\n\nAnime and Manga\n\nAsian Animation\n\nPleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf has had a lot of different theme songs over its run, but the original theme from season 1 is still the most popular song from the show. The original theme song is still associated with Pleasant Goat several years after the show began using different theme songs. This might be because the original theme song is still used here and there, just in the closing instead of the opening.\n\nComic Books\n\nComic Strips\n\nFan Works\n\nFilms \u2014 Animation\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie at one point features a scene where Bowser sings a Villain Love Song called \"Peaches\", about his crush Princess Peach. The song quickly became regarded as a highlight of the film, with many \"'Peaches', but every time he says 'Peaches', X happens\" memes being made out of it shortly after the film released.\n\nFor Turning Red, FINNEAS and Billie Eilish wrote \"U Know What\u2019s Up\" to be this for 4*Town. The producer, Lindsey Collins describes it as being written to be, In-Universe, \"a hit song that everybody knows\".\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nWandaVision has plenty of musical themes, but the most notable one is \"Agatha All Along\" since it is the only song from the show to top the iTunes charts as well as the fact that the song has received a large amount of Memetic Mutation.\n\nMusic\n\nVideo Games\n\nWeb Comics"}, {"url": "https://www.homesandgardens.com/advice/kelly-wearstler-reveals-how-she-mixes-vintage-and-contemporary-styles", "page_content": "We are big fans of the flamboyant, eclectic style of Kelly Wearstler \u2013 from her sculptural furniture designs to her expressive, liveable interiors and her colorful collaborations.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Homes & Gardens, she reveals how she achieves that Kelly Wearstler look, mixing vintage and contemporary pieces for a balanced scheme.\n\n1.

Vintage carpets can be so beautiful, the fading of the colors and the patina of the rug.'\n\n4. Check online vintage buys carefully\n\n(Image credit: Kelly Wearstler)\n\n'I always look at quality when buying vintage and how something\u2019s put together. When sourcing online, you have to make sure you know what you\u2019re getting. Ask for a condition report and photos of everywhere even the underside of a table.\n\n'Checking if there are any labels is important, too \u2013 if it\u2019s a classic piece, make sure the label or insignia is attached or intact. And don\u2019t be afraid to bargain and cost reference what you\u2019re buying.\n\n'When buying chairs online, I ask the vendor to have somebody sit in the chair and take photos at all angles. Or if I\u2019m buying a credenza, I ask them to put a lamp on it, and a chair next to it, because it helps with understanding the scale.'\n\n5. Where I shop for vintage\n\n'I visit lots of flea markets and vintage stores. I always go to Round Top in Austin for a big shop! I also love 1stDibs, Brimfield Market, JF Chen, The Future Perfect, Holster Burrows and Pamono.\n\n'The auction houses I go to are Cambi and Piasa. I love finding pieces by Pierre Paulin, Augusto Bozzi, Gae Aulenti, Tito Angoli and Franco Albini."}, {"url": "https://www.ft.lk/columns/Singer-Actress-Doris-Day-s-evergreen-signature-song-Que-Sera-Sera/4-682760", "page_content": "Doris Day\n\nWhen I was just a little kid enrolled at the Santa Maria Montessori school in Wattala, a song we sang without knowing its meaning then was \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019; when I was a boy studying at S. Thomas\u2019 Preparatory School in Kollupitiya, a song we were taught the meaning of and sang loudly in our singing class period was \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019; when I was growing up, passing through various phases of adolescence, a song we frequently sang and heard being sung was \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019; when I entered adulthood and participated in many a high-spirited sing-song session, one song that was sung repeatedly at such gatherings was \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019; when I departed from Sri Lanka and relocated to Canada, a favourite number regularly sung at parties organised by nostalgic Sri Lankans was \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019.\n\n\n\n\u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 pronounced \u2018Kay Sera Sera\u2019 means \u201cWhatever will be, will be\u201d or \u201cWhat will be, will be\u201d. It is one of the most popular songs to be featured in an English film. It was the well-known singing actress Doris Day who sang it in the film \u2018The Man Who Knew Too Much\u2019 released in 1956. The film was directed by the legendary Alfred Hitchcock. It was a revised version of a film, by the same name, made in 1934 by Hitchcock. The song written and composed by the American duo Jay Livingston and Ray Evans became an instant hit.\n\n\n\nAs the years progressed in Toronto, I acquired a DVD of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s movie \u2018The Man Who Knew Too Much\u2019 as well as a CD of Doris Day numbers and occasionally watched the film or listened to the ever-popular \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019. When Doris Day died last May at the age of 97, I watched DVDs of the actress-singer\u2019s films and listened to her CDs. \u2018The Man Who Knew Too Much\u2019 and \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 figured prominently in that binge of nostalgia. The \u2018Spotlight\u2019 column appearing after several weeks focuses therefore on this remarkable song and singer this week.\n\n\n\nDoris Day was born on 3 April 1922 as Doris Mary Kappelhoff in Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. Both her parents were of German origin. She adopted the stage name Doris Day and commenced a career in singing. Starting out as a singer on radio and at restaurants, Doris joined popular bands and began recording singles.\n\n\n\nThe Director Michael Curtiz gave her a break in acting by casting her in the film \u2018Romance in the High Seas\u2019. Curtiz felt she had that \u201call-American girl look\u201d. Doris Day became rapidly popular and was voted favourite star by US servicemen stationed in Korea. She acted in a number of romantic musical comedies. Doris acted with a number of leading Hollywood actors including Rock Hudson with whom she paired off best.\n\n\n\nDoris Day was a successful singer cum actress who was the top star of her day in the late fifties and early sixties of the 20th century. She passed away on 13 May 2019. Many of her songs remain as perennial favourites but the widely-popular evergreen number \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 is adjudged by many as Doris Day\u2019s signature song.\n\n\u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019\n\nThe song \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 is sung in the first person by a woman in a reflective, pensive frame of mind. It has four verses denoting four phases of her life in progressive order. She is a child, young adult, lover and mother respectively. (In some versions there are only three verses, with the one relating to the teacher being left out.)\n\n\n\nIn the first three verses she is concerned about her future and asks pointed questions. First as a child she asks her mother, \u201cWhat will I be?\u201d Next as a student she asks her teacher, \u201cWhat will I try?\u201d Then as a lover she asks her sweetheart, \u201cWhat lies ahead?\u201d Finally as a mother she is now asked by her children the same question she once asked her mother, \u201cWhat will I be?\u201d\n\n\n\nThere is only one answer to all these questions at various levels \u2013 \u201cWhatever will be, will be; the future\u2019s not ours to see. Que sera, sera; what will be, will be,\u201d sung as a chorus.\n\n\n\nIn the film it is sung twice in parts by Doris Day who plays Josephine Conway a popular singer now married to a medical doctor Benjamin Mckenna played by James Stewart. In an early sequence she sings some verses of the song along with her son. We also see the son Hank whistle the tune loudly. This is of significance later on. These scenes portray the Mackennas as a typical all-American family.\n\n\n\nIn the climax sequences the song are sung by her again in a tense, suspense-ridden atmosphere. Josephine and Benjamin are honoured guests at the London Embassy of a foreign country while their son is being held prisoner in the same embassy premises. In a melodramatic twist Josephine or Jo gets to sing \u2018Que Sera Sera,\u2019 which is heard by the son who whistles the tune loudly, thereby alerting the father, who then manages to rescue him. The song in the film therefore is in two parts. Both have to be combined as one song.\n\nA huge success\n\n\u2018The Man Who Knew Too Much\u2019 was a huge commercial success in 1956. The film was produced on a budget of $ 1.2 million but US box office earnings alone amounted to $ 11.2 million. It was also well-received internationally.\n\n\n\nThe chief attraction of the film was the song \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019. The song won for Jay Livingston and Ray Evans an Oscar for Best Original Song in 1956. The singles record released by Columbia records boomed in sales and topped the charts that year in the UK. In the USA it was No. 2 on \u2018Billboard 100\u2019. In 2004 the American Film Institute ranked \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 as No. 48 among the 100 best songs in American cinema.\n\n\n\n\u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 gave Ray Evans and Jay Livingston their third Oscar for best original songs in films. The earlier ones were for \u2018Buttons and Bows\u2019 in \u2018The Paleface\u2019 and \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019 in \u2018Captain Carey, USA\u2019. Usually Ray Evans wrote the words and Jay Livingston composed the tunes in their collaborative efforts. But in this case much of the lyrics were also written by Jay. How they came to work on the song and how they chose the words \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 is an interesting tale.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow it came to be\n\nIn the book \u2018Songwriters on Songwriting\u2019 by Paul Zollo, Ray and Jay state as follows \u2013 \u201cWe got a call from Alfred Hitchcock. And he told us that he had Doris Day in his picture, whom he didn\u2019t want. But MCA (Music Corporation of America), the agency, was so powerful that they said if he wanted Jimmy Stewart he would also have to take Doris Day and Livingston and Evans. It was the only time an agent got us a job that I can remember. Hitchcock said that since Doris Day was a singer, they needed a song for her. He said, \u2018I can tell you what it should be about. She sings it to a boy. It should have a foreign title because Jimmy Stewart is a roving ambassador and he goes all over the world.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nThough Ray and Jay say Doris Day was imposed upon Hitchcock, the film\u2019s Associate Producer Herbert Coleman was quoted differently in the documentary \u2018The Making of The Man Who Knew Too Much\u2019. According to Coleman, Hitchcock had seen the film \u2018Storm Warning\u2019 starring Ronald Reagan (US President 1981-\u201988) and Doris Day and wanted to cast her as his leading lady. It was Coleman who protested and suggested other actresses like Lana Turner, Kim Novak, Jane Russell or Ava Gardner instead. Finally Hitchcock had his way and Doris Day was chosen. This was entirely Hitchcock\u2019s decision. There was no pressure.\n\n\n\nA clearer picture of how the song came to be written and picturised in the film is provided in the book \u2018Hitchcock\u2019s Music\u2019 by Jack Sullivan. Apparently Paramount Pictures which was to distribute the film had insisted that a song by Doris Day should be included in the film as fans would definitely expect one from the popular singer-actress. Paramount also wanted the song to be written and composed by the Livingston-Evans duo with whom they had a 10-year contract. Hitchcock though reluctant was compelled to agree.\n\n\n\nThe music score for the film was by Bernard Hermann who was a favourite of Hitchcock, having composed music for several of the director\u2019s movies. It was Hermann who was responsible for the Back Ground Music (BGM) in this film too though Jay and Ray were tasked with the Doris Day number. The renowned director, famous for the suspense in his movies, thought of a sequence where the song on screen would be an integral component of a thrilling climax scene.\n\n\n\nHitchcock told Livingston and Evans: \u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of song I want. But Jimmy Stewart is a roving ambassador and it would be nice if the song had some foreign words in the title. Also, in the picture, I have it set up so that Doris sings to their little boy.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs stated earlier it was Livingston who generally composed the music while Evans wrote the words. But in this film the order was reversed. It was Jay Livingston who wrote most of the words as well as the tune. What had happened was that in 1954, Livingston had seen the film \u2018The Barefoot Contessa\u2019 starring Ava Gardner, Humphrey Bogart and Edmond O\u2019Brien. It was directed by Joseph L. Manckiewicz. In the film the fictional Italian aristocratic family has the motto \u2018Che Sara Sara\u2019 carved in stone at their ancestral villa. It is also engraved on the Contessa\u2019s tombstone.\n\n\n\nJay Livingston, struck by the three words \u2018Che Sara Sara,\u2019 had written it down \u2013 in the darkness of the cinema theatre \u2013 in his notebook. He had thought the words were suitable for a song. So when Hitchcock wanted a song title with foreign words, Livingston suggested \u2018Che Sara Sara\u2019. It was later changed from Italian to the Spanish \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019. Thereafter the duo plunged zestfully into writing the song with the \u201cinspired\u201d Jay Livingston contributing the most. It was over in three days but Jay and Ray delayed it for two weeks before submitting to Hitchcock.\n\n\n\nThe director was delighted and so was Paramount but there was a hitch. Paramount Pictures recognised immediately that the song possessed Oscar-winning potential. However the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) awarding Oscars would not approve of a song with a \u2018foreign\u2019 title. So the title of the song was modified into \u2018Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera Sera)\u2019 in the film and nominated for the Oscars where it struck gold.\n\nHow wrong she was!\n\nDoris Day, however, did not like the song and described it as a \u201ckiddie song\u201d. As she later recollected in an interview to the NPR radio, \u201cI thought I\u2019m not crazy about that. Where are they going to put it? You know, for what? Is it when I put him in bed sometime and I sing that to him or something? I did that in another film. And I thought maybe that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be. And I just, I didn\u2019t think it was a good song.\u201d\n\nHowever Alfred Hitchcock and her husband Martin Melcher persuaded Doris Day to record it. Martin, her third husband, was also her manager. So a reluctant Doris Day went through with it and recorded the song in one take. And then she said, \u201cThat\u2019s the last you\u2019re going to hear of this song.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nHow wrong she was! Not only did the song win an Oscar but it was also a chart-buster. Furthermore, the song proved to be the greatest hit ever sung by Doris Day.\n\n\n\nHowever in the same NPR interview cited earlier, Doris Day half-heartedly accepted the popularity of the song. She reportedly said: \u201cSo maybe it isn\u2019t a favourite song of mine, but people loved it. And kids loved it. And it was perfect for the film. So, you know, I can\u2019t say that it\u2019s a favourite song of mine and I think it\u2019s fabulous but, boy, it sure did something. It came out and it was loved.\u201d How true!\n\nUniversal appeal\n\nThe song beginning \u201cWhen I was just a little girl, I asked my mother what will I be\u201d had a universal appeal. The song became widely popular within a few years in many different countries. In Sri Lanka, known then as Ceylon, the song \u2013 like those of Jim Reeves \u2013 became very popular with Western music listeners. Many lips chanted \u201cQue Sera Sera\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe song was picked up by other linguistic cultures too. Songs with modified variations of the melody and words have appeared in 35 different languages. Among these are French, German, Hungarian, Swedish, Italian, Spanish, Estonian, Polish, Latvian, Yiddish, Japanese, Cantonese and Mandarin versions of the song.\n\n\n\nThe words \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 soon acquired a unique appeal of its own. The three memorable words were adopted and adapted in different ways. For instance the Indian film \u2018Pukar\u2019 released in Hindi has a dance sequence featuring Madhuri Dixit and Prabhu Deva. The song they danced to was \u2018Kay Sera Sera\u2019. The singers were Shankar Mahaevan, Kavita Krishnamurthy and Swarnalatha. The lyricists were Javed Akthar and Majrooh Sultanpuri.\n\n\n\nA.R. Rahman composed the music. What Rahman did was to re-utilise the melody of the song \u2018Kaadhal Niagara\u2019 from an earlier Tamil film \u2018En Swaasak Kaatre\u2019 for the popular Hindi song. Though the tune and words were totally different, the chorus and title of the song was \u2018Kay Sera Sera\u2019 derived from the English \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019.\n\n\n\nEven the Tamil film \u2018Aaravalli\u2019 produced by Modern Theatres in 1957 had a spinoff from \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019. The Tamil song \u2018Chinnap Pennaana Poathiley\u2019 sung by the real-life husband and wife pair Jikki-A.M. Rajah remains a perennial favourite. The words were written by Pattukkoattai Kalyanasundaram and music composed by G. Ramanathan. The substitute for \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 in Tamil were the words \u2018Vennilaa, Nilaa\u2019 (Silver Moon, Oh Moon). The versatile Indian actress-singer Dr. Bhanumati Ramakrishna sang verses from the song in English for the Telugu film \u2018Thodu Needa\u2019.\n\nSignature song\n\nThough Doris Day sang many songs on screen and stage and released several records and albums \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 is regarded as her signature song. When the singer-actress launched her own \u2018Doris Day Show\u2019 from 1968 to 1973 on TV, the theme song was \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019. She also sang snippets from the song in some other films she acted in. She sang the song to her co-star David Niven in the film \u2018Please Don\u2019t Eat Daisies\u2019. In the film \u2018The Glass Bottom Boat,\u2019 she sings to the accompaniment on ukulele by her co-star Arthur Godfrey.\n\n\n\nA very interesting aspect of the song\u2019s popularity has been its adaptation into a rousing football chant by the robust soccer fans of Britain. The prestigious FA cup finals in England have been played in Wembley Stadium since 1923. When clubs play each other, partisan fans treat each success as a significant milepost on the road to Wembley or ultimate victory. So when their favourite team triumphs, British fans celebrate by chanting lustily, \u201cQue Sera Sera, Whatever will be will be, We\u2019re going to Wembley, Que sera sera.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe magical words \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 are by themselves somewhat fatalistic. What is destined to happen will happen. It cannot be foreseen. Yet the song imbues one with a sense of confidence and courage. Instead of forebodings about an uncertain future, the song instils optimistic hopes. It also says indirectly that there is nothing new in life and that the cycle of life will keep turning \u2013 from daughter to mother and mother to daughter. \u2018Que Sera Sera\u2019 has been described by some as a song of \u201ccheerful fatalism\u201d.\n\n\u2018Whatever Will Be, Will Be (Que Sera Sera)\u2019\n\nWhen I was just a little girl,\n\n\n\nI asked my mother, \u201cWhat will I be?\n\n\n\nWill I be pretty?\n\n\n\nWill I be rich?\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what she said to me:\n\n\n\n\u201cQue sera, sera,\n\n\n\nWhatever will be, will be;\n\n\n\nThe future\u2019s not ours to see.\n\n\n\nQue sera, sera,\n\n\n\nWhat will be, will be.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen I was just a child in school,\n\n\n\nI asked my teacher, \u201cWhat will I try?\n\n\n\nShould I paint pictures,\u201d\n\n\n\nShould I sing songs?\u201d\n\n\n\nThis was her wise reply:\n\n\n\n\u201cQue sera, sera,\n\n\n\nWhatever will be,\n\n\n\nwill be;\n\n\n\nThe future\u2019s not\n\n\n\nours to see.\n\n\n\nQue sera, sera,\n\n\n\nWhat will be, will be.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen I grew up and fell in love.\n\n\n\nI asked my sweetheart, \u201cWhat lies ahead?\n\n\n\nWill we have rainbows\n\n\n\nDay after day?\u201d\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s what my sweetheart said:\n\n\n\n\u201cQue sera, sera,\n\n\n\nWhatever will be, will be;\n\n\n\nThe future\u2019s not ours to see.\n\n\n\nQue sera, sera,\n\n\n\nWhat will be, will be.\u201d\n\n\n\nNow I have children of my own.\n\n\n\nThey ask their mother, \u201cWhat will I be?\u201d\n\n\n\nWill I be handsome?\n\n\n\nWill I be rich?\u201d\n\n\n\nI tell them tenderly:\n\n\n\n\u201cQue sera, sera,\n\n\n\nWhatever will be, will be;\n\n\n\nThe future\u2019s not ours to see.\n\n\n\nQue sera, sera,\n\n\n\nWhat will be, will be.\n\n\n\nQue Sera, Sera!\n\n(D.B.S.

However, it was through his uncle Terrell Ledbetter that he had his first contact with the guitar. As Lead Belly\u2019s passion for music began to grow along with his talent he also learned to sing and play the accordion, mandolin, piano and the 12-string guitar (which he called \u201cStella\u201d). In 1930, Lead Belly was taken to New York by the folklorists John and Alan Lomax after being found imprisoned in an Angola Farm prison plantation because of a fight. With this move from Louisiana to New York, Lead Belly began to play on college campuses in front of larger audiences. He would eventually begin to work for labels (e.g. Capitol Records) and radio stations (Back Where I Come From / Folk Music of America). During his musical career, Lead Belly composed more than 500 songs (which can be found in the Library of Congress), won recognition across the country and toured Europe. He passed away in December 1949 due to ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. In 1988, Lead Belly was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His songs, guitar picking style, big voice, and melding of Folk and Blues have influenced countless musicians over the decades, including many of the pioneers of Rock and Roll.

She was the first gospel artist to successfully make the crossover to wider audiences, popularizing spiritual music and introducing the use of the electric guitar into mainstream music. Memphis Minnie, Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, along with hymns and spirituals were all influential in shaping Rosetta\u2019s musical style. The Great Migration of the 1920s brought Rosetta and her mother from rural Arkansas to Chicago. A better life and opportunities were greater for Blacks in bigger cities. Rosetta brought her roots in Gospel music and the soulful, Black sounds of the Blues. She was known for her incredible vocal range, her stunning full-bodied vibrato, and her impressive vocal agility. Her vocal phrasing captured her beefy sound that leaned into her heavy Blues influences. She was a foundational artist who precedes those we commonly think of today as cornerstone, Rock and Roll pioneers. She influenced artists such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, as well as many 1960s British guitarists. Her song \u201cStrange Things Are Happening Everyday\u201d was recorded in 1945. It became the first Gospel record to cross over to the \u201cRace Records\u201d Billboards chart, and is considered by some to be the first Rock and Roll record. It was revolutionary for Tharpe, a Black woman, to straddle the fence in playing at both churches and nightclubs. However, this caused her to receive a great deal of criticism from disapproving church members. She was not only one of the first artists to perform with an electric guitar but she spiced things up by being the first female artist playing it during its debut in the 1930s. This was an unheard of accomplishment during this time in American society. It can be said that Tharpe\u2019s flamboyant style, rebellious nature, and stage theatrics shaped the rawness of the earliest rock and rollers. In the 1960s, Tharpe\u2019s celebrity status grew as well overseas in Europe. Muddy Waters was one of the artists she toured with in Europe. In 1964, British television filmed the \u201cBlues and Gospel Train\u201d that included her performance at Wilbraham Road train station in Whalley Range, a performance which is legendary in the influence it had on many of the British rock musicians who saw it.

He was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi on May 8, 1911. His biological father was forced to dress up like a woman and leave town to avoid lynching before Robert was born. As there were few performance opportunities in Mississippi for young Black artists, Robert played mostly at Juke Joints and on street corners in front of bars. He was known to be persistent in trying to get opportunities to play with bands that came through town while he was still a developing guitarist. He was not yet good and was chased off the stage quite often. When Robert moved to Robinsonville in 1919, he found his mentor in Son House. It\u2019s said that Robert went off with Son to learn how to play guitar by sitting in graveyards. He disappeared for about 2 years and when he returned, he\u2019d mastered the guitar. He\u2019d gone from being a notoriously bad guitarist to being able to outplay anyone. Some speculate it was 2 years of intense practice that helped him accomplish this and others said he\u2019d sold his soul to the devil for the ability to play the way he did. Other guitarists of the time said it sounded as if 3 men were playing the guitar when Robert played. This myth is furthered by the lyrics of some of his most famous songs \u201cCross Road Blues\u201d and \u201cHell Hound On My Trail.\u201d Johnson\u2019s career was short as he only participated in 2 recordings during his lifetime. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 as an early influence on Rock and Roll. He was also given a Grammy Hall of Fame Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998.

Born in Newport News, Virginia, Ella\u2019s life got off to a rough start. Ella\u2019s father left the family when she was 3 years old, and when she was fifteen her mother died from injuries sustained in a car accident, leaving her stepfather to care for her. It was widely believed that he abused Ella. She later went to live with her Aunt in New York but her behavior landed her in a reform school and the \u201cColored Orphan Asylum\u201d in the Bronx. Ella got her musical start singing in church, but between the ages of 15 and 18, Ella was homeless and made money by singing on the streets of Harlem. Ella got her break when Chuck Webb, a young band leader in Harlem, decided that his band needed a female vocalist. He asked Charles Linton, the band\u2019s lead singer, to find him one. Charles Webb did not initially want to listen to Ella because she was not the thin white lead vocalist that he had in mind. Linton had to threaten to quit in order to get Charles Webb to listen to her. Charles gave in and agreed to give her a two week trial period. Ella of course got the gig. Ella was known for her three-octave range, superb diction, effortless swing, and her ability to scat. She was also known to have \u201cone of the best ears in the business,\u201d resulting in the interesting melodic choices she made and her ability to quickly memorize songs. Ella made a name for herself in the face of discrimination against women and racism. She also started her career during the Great Depression. She was the first African-American woman to win multiple Grammy Awards. Finally, she was one of the first stars to perform during the Super Bowl Halftime Show in 1972. Ella has won 14 Grammy Awards, including one for lifetime achievement, as well as a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime achievement (1979) and the National Medal of Arts (1987).

King Biography Muddy Waters was born as McKinley Morganfield in Mississippi in 1913. As a teenager, he began playing guitar steeped in the local tradition of the Delta Blues and influenced by local legends like Robert Johnson and Son House. He chose the stage name Muddy Waters from a nickname given to him by his grandmother. In the early 1940s, Waters was inspired to pursue music full time when he was recorded by the ethnomusicologist Alan Lomax. He moved to Chicago in 1943, where he was taken under wing by Big Bill Broonzy. Waters quickly gained popularity in Chicago\u2019s burgeoning electric Blues scene and was one of the first acts signed to the new Chess Records. Where Blues music to that point had traditionally been performed on acoustic instruments, Chicago Blues was characterized by the addition of electric instruments and drum kit. Waters\u2019 guitar style adapted the Delta Blues of his youth to the electric guitar and he was renowned for his expressive and aggressive slide playing. At Chess, Muddy Waters assembled a legendary backing band and produced numerous hits throughout the 1950s that would become Blues standards. Bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon was a frequent collaborator, and many of Waters\u2019 backing musicians from that era became stars in their own right, including Otis Spann, Little Walter, Jimmy Rogers, and Buddy Guy. Muddy Waters and Howlin\u2019 Wolf became the leading ambassadors for electric Blues through heavy international touring, and influenced countless young musicians in both America and England who would form the next generation of Blues and Rock and Roll players. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, Waters would occasionally collaborate with musicians who grew up idolizing him, such as Johnny Winter, The Band, Paul Butterfield, and The Rolling Stones (who got their name from his signature song \u201cRollin\u2019 Stone\u201d). Muddy Waters died in 1983 but his artistry and influence changed the course of modern music. Rock and Roll simply wouldn\u2019t have been the same without him, and Waters was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.

Born in Mississippi, Bo was raised in Chicago by his mother\u2019s cousin who adopted him. Bridging the gap between Blues and creation of Rock and Roll, Bo Diddley is known as \u201cthe Originator\u201d. Bo began playing professionally in the mid '40s and worked his way up from West Side street corners to the South Side clubs. In 1955, he recorded his first hit \u201cBo Diddley\u201d for Checker Records (subsidiary of Chess Records). Bo followed that up with two more hits, \u201cPretty Thing\u201d, and \u201cMona.\u201d In the '60s Bo continued to tour and release additional hits such as \u201cCan\u2019t Judge a Book\u201d and \u201cRoadrunner\u201d. Bo was incredibly popular in England where he was a major influence on the British Invasion bands, especially the Rolling Stones and the Pretty Things, who took their name from Bo\u2019s hit single. The Bo Diddley beat is one of the most recognizable rhythms in Rock and Roll. Influenced by African percussion patterns, it\u2019s essentially a variation of the 5 note clave beat. While it existed in Rhythm and Blues music previously as a type of Rhumba beat, the Bo Diddley beat was featured on many of Bo\u2019s tunes. It also has roots in an African American tradition known as \u201chambone\u201d which combines dancing or stomping with rhythmic drumming on the body. This West African tradition was carried on by slaves when they were not allowed to play or possess instruments. In many ways Bo Diddley represents an archetypal, larger than life mythical figure. His self proclamations and boasts are proto-Rap. In \u201cWho Do You Love\u201d, Bo stakes his claim as a powerful and dangerous young man: \"Tombstone hand and a graveyard mind, just 22 and I don't mind dying.\" The song \u201cSay Man\u201d featured Bo and Jerome Green trading insults with each other in the African American tradition of \u201cthe dozens,\u201d a game where the participants try to outdo each other with elaborate putdowns. Bo was also known for his non-traditional guitars, including his square custom Gretsch. Bo Diddley also had a unique sound due to the instrumentation of his bands. They featured Bo\u2019s tremolo-drenched guitar and Jerome Green\u2019s insistent maracas. Many of Bo\u2019s biggest songs only employed one chord, placing the emphasis on the beat and rhythm. Bo is also credited with having women in his band, including female lead guitarist Lady Bo (Peggy Jones). Bo was inducted into the second class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. In 1989 Bo, along with athlete Bo Jackson, starred in Nike's \u201cBo Knows\u201d ad campaign. Bo continued to perform until he suffered a stroke in 2007, and he passed away in 2009. Bo Diddley was a true American original whose influence can be heard in hundreds of songs, from Buddy Holly\u2019s \u201cNot Fade Away\u201d to U2\u2019s \u201cDesire\u201d.

She was born in Alabama as Willie Mae Thornton and grew up singing in her father\u2019s church. Thornton was nicknamed \u201cBig Mama\u201d at the beginning of her career by a manager of The Apollo Theater who was impressed by her immensely powerful voice and her larger-than-life personality. Thornton\u2019s career took off in 1952 when she recorded the song \u201cHound Dog\u201d, which was written specifically for her. While Elvis Presley\u2019s later version of this song is more widely known, Big Mama Thornton\u2019s version is hailed as a seminal Rock and Roll performance due to her unbridled and soulful vocals which draw as much from her early Gospel influences as from the Blues. Thornton later worked with Blues legends such as Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, and John Lee Hooker, though she never duplicated the popular success of \u201cHound Dog.\u201d Her career enjoyed a resurgence in the late 1960s when Janis Joplin, a huge admirer, covered Thornton\u2019s original Blues song \u201cBall and Chain\u201d and offered her an opening slot on tour. Big Mama Thornton\u2019s career stalled in the late 1970s and early 1980s, as her talents and contributions were overlooked by white audiences and she suffered through health complications brought on by alcohol abuse. She died in 1984. In recent years, more and more music fans have become aware of her work and her legacy as a Blues singer and one of the early pioneers of Rock and Roll music. Aside from her incredible voice, as powerful as anyone\u2019s in popular music history, Thornton was greatly admired by her contemporaries for her unyielding non-conformity and her celebration of body-positivity.
