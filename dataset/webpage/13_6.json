{"Noel Anthony Hogan produced The Cranberries' albums Bury the Hatchet (1999) and Wake Up and Smell the Coffee (2001).": [{"url": "https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/noel-hogan-cranberries-everybody-else-interview/", "page_content": "Cover: Courtesy of Island Def Jam Music Group\n\nWhen The Cranberries\u2019 debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?, turned 25, in March 2018, it should have been a joyous occasion for all concerned. However, after the tragic death of vocalist Dolores O\u2019Riordan, on January 15, the mooted anniversary edition of their landmark record was put on hold while the band mourned the sudden and unexpected loss of their friend. Eventually, though, The Cranberries\u2019 instrumental trio \u2013 guitarist Noel Hogan, his bassist brother Mike and drummer Fergal Lawlor \u2013 made the unanimous decision to press ahead with the reissue of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?.\n\nListen to the super deluxe edition of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? now.\n\nFounding member Noel Hogan was Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s songwriting partner in The Cranberries and, as he told us in an exclusive interview, their debut album still \u201cjust sounds like a great collection of songs.\u201d Yet, as he goes on to reveal, when the young Irish teenagers began learning their craft in Limerick, the idea that they could possibly experience mainstream success was beyond their comprehension.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThis was around the time of The Joshua Tree, and U2 were just massive,\u201d Hogan says. \u201cIf you thought Irish rock music, you thought U2, but that was way out of our reach. Coming from a small town in the south of Ireland, we thought no further than forming a band and playing a local club in front of a few friends if ever we got good enough. Really, we would have been content with that.\u201d\n\nAs Hogan freely admits, he started the band with his brother and long-time school friend Lawlor \u201cwithout even knowing a chord.\u201d Yet the trio were galvanized by punk\u2019s DIY ethic and their collective love of classic English indie-pop acts such as The Cure and Echo & The Bunnymen. This led to The Cranberries\u2019 initial line-up: a much quirkier affair known as The Cranberry Saw Us featuring the Hogans, Lawlor and local singer-songwriter Niall Quinn. The latter\u2019s tenure was brief, but he later introduced the band to Dolores O\u2019Riordan: a friend of Quinn\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s sister and also a budding local singer-songwriter.\n\n\u201cThat day changed our lives\u201d\n\n\u201cWe played a few songs for her, then she sang Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s \u2018Troy\u2019 and a couple of songs she\u2019d written, and it was obvious she could sing, so that was it \u2013 she was in,\u201d Noel Hogan says, recalling the classic line-up\u2019s embryonic first rehearsal.\n\n\u201cI gave her a cassette with the music for \u2018Linger\u2019 on it,\u201d he adds, \u201cand a few days later, Dolores brought it back with all the words and the song that we now all know. That was the first song we wrote together. At the time, it was just another song and another day, but years later I realize how much that day changed our lives.\u201d\n\nThe Cranberries - Linger (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nHaving found the final piece of their puzzle with O\u2019Riordan, The Cranberries sporadically performed low-key local gigs and began looking for a deal when they had a set of songs in place. Hogan, for one, was determined the band would bypass the small and insular Irish club circuit and send their first demo direct to London.\n\nRemarkably, the tape immediately received a positive response from Rough Trade\u2019s Geoff Travis (later to become their manager). While they didn\u2019t sign to Travis\u2019 label, the enthusiastic response later set off a bidding war in London, with numerous major labels keen to sign the band.\n\nNoel Hogan elaborates: \u201cIsland were actually the last label to show an interest, but their A&R guy, Denny Cordell, was just completely different to the others. He was an English guy based in New York. He\u2019d produced [Procol Harum\u2019s] \u2018A Whiter Shade Of Pale,\u2019 he knew [Island boss] Chris Blackwell and the whole business inside out, but he was realistic too. Unlike the other labels, he didn\u2019t promise us the world. We just had a feeling about him and, thankfully, we were right. He died early, sadly, but he always believed in us and if it wasn\u2019t for Denny, we\u2019d never have taken off.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe perfect time and place\u201d\n\nAfter the initial album sessions at The Cranberries\u2019 demo studio in Limerick failed to work out, the band asked Island if they could work with Stephen Street. As his CV included engineering and production credits with The Smiths and on Morrissey\u2019s Viva Hate solo album, O\u2019Riordan and company were big fans, but they felt they were chancing their arm when they suggested hooking up with the much in-demand producer.\n\nAs it turned out, Street had already seen The Cranberries play at London\u2019s Marquee and immediately saw their potential. After an initial trial session which pleased all concerned, the producer \u2013 whose credits also include Blur and Kaiser Chiefs \u2013 signed up to man the console for the Everybody Else Is Doing It\u2026 sessions.\n\n\u201cWe more or less knew what we wanted, but not quite how to get it, and that\u2019s where Stephen comes in,\u201d Hogan reveals. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t completely change what you have, but he always wants to explore your ideas \u2013 he\u2019s great at fine-tuning your music and keeping you focused. You look forward going to the studio every day with Stephen and I think that\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent 30 years working with him. We\u2019ve the greatest respect for him.\u201d\n\nNoel Hogan remembers Everybody Else Is Doing It\u2026 as \u201cthe perfect time and place for us,\u201d and that everything slotted into place for them artistically. Yet, while the band felt they had a great debut under their belt, the initial response to the album was lukewarm.\n\nFearing that their time had come and gone, the band set off on tour, accepting a mismatched opening slot for The Hothouse Flowers. However, while they slogged around half-empty European concert halls, Noel Hogan and company were completely oblivious to what was happening across the Atlantic.\n\n\u201cWe were about a month into the European tour and we get a call out of the blue, requesting we come to the States,\u201d he remembers. \u201cDenny Cordell had been working on [the album\u2019s] first single, \u2018Linger,\u2019 in New York and it had become a hit on college radio, where it had gone to No.8. Suddenly, from thinking we were about to get dropped by Island, we went to play our first American gig in Denver, Colorado, opening for The The. We went onstage and everyone knew the songs and the place just went mental.\n\n\u201cOvernight, it literally went from us thinking our career was dead to this \u2013 and from then on, it went from strength to strength. MTV picked up on \u2018Linger\u2019 and put it on heavy rotation and off we went.\u201d\n\n\u201cSongs I honestly feel have stood the test of time\u201d\n\nWith a buzz building around the band, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? went on to enjoy a remarkable second life in the UK and Europe. Underlining the quality of Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s haunting, ethereal vocals, and the band\u2019s sophisticated melodicism, the album\u2019s signature tracks, \u201cLinger\u201d and \u201cDreams,\u201d both cracked the UK Top 30, with the album itself topping the British charts in the summer of 1994 and moving over six million copies worldwide.\n\nThe Cranberries - Dreams (Dir: Peter Scammell) (Official Music Video)\n\nWatch this video on YouTube Click to load video\n\nOn its own, the newly-remastered Everybody Else Is Doing Is, So Why Can\u2019t We? reminds us why its reputation as one of the key alt-rock albums of the 90s remains gloriously intact, but its new edition also offers a wealth of rare and previously unreleased material that paints a bigger picture.\n\nEarly demo recordings reveal how The Cranberries often reworked and honed their songs\u2019 arrangements, while their radio sessions for the BBC\u2019s John Peel and Irish DJ Dave Fanning are joined by valuable rarities including the eerie, Irish-language \u201c\u00cdosa\u201d and the first-ever demo recording of \u201cDreams\u201d: the latter mastered from a cassette Noel Hogan came upon in his garage completely by accident.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t listened to the album front to back in 20 years, so when I heard the remastered version at Abbey Road in February, I was genuinely shocked by how good it sounded,\u201d Noel Hogan confesses. \u201cIt was only about a month after Dolores\u2019 death, so hearing her voice was emotional, obviously, but even so, I was really surprised and delighted that four young kids from Limerick could produce an album with songs I honestly feel have stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nThis feature was first published in late 2018. We are re-publishing it today in celebration of the March 1, 1993, release of the album. The 25th-anniversary edition of Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We? is out now."}, {"url": "https://www.musicradar.com/news/the-cranberries-noel-hogan-doing-the-album-when-we-did-it-was-almost-like-therapy-for-us", "page_content": "Hit with the passing of their iconic vocalist Dolores O\u2019Riordan, Ireland\u2019s indie icons the Cranberries have wrung a remarkable final record from their grief.\n\nThe final lyric on The Cranberries\u2019 last record, In The End - \u2018It\u2019s strange when everything that you dreamt of was nothing that you dreamt of/in the end...\u2019 - is the last line The Cranberries will ever record - of that much guitarist and songwriter Noel Hogan is certain.\n\nIt sums up, in the typically pointed, yet dream-like hand of vocalist/co-writer Dolores O\u2019Riordan, the poisoned chalice of success in a rock band, of her life and, ultimately, her tragic and untimely passing in January 2018.\n\nI know it was shock but I just kept thinking that first day, \u2018It\u2019s a mistake. There\u2019s been a mix-up\u2019\n\nWhile death always seems unjust, in the case of O\u2019Riordan, it feels particularly cruel. The singer faced ongoing physical and mental health issues, but was reportedly doing well in her personal and professional life in the period before her passing on Monday 15 January, 2018.\n\n\u201cI had spoken to her on the Friday a lot. Nearly all day long, on and off, so it was actually a really, really good day,\u201d recalls The Cranberries guitarist and co-writer Noel Hogan.\n\n\u201cThen Sunday morning I get an email from her with a song. She was at the airport flying to London, and I thought, \u2018Cool, I\u2019ll listen to that tomorrow.\u2019 The next thing I know, it\u2019s the Monday morning and I get a phone call from her brother telling me what had happened.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Riordan had been found in the bathtub of her room in London\u2019s Park Lane Hilton hotel. The inquest ruled the cause of death as accidental drowning following intoxication. Aged just 46, she left behind three children, her partner Ole\u0301 Koretsky and the rest of The Cranberries - her friends and confidantes of 30 years.\n\n\u201cIt just didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Noel says, pausing periodically. \u201cI know it was shock but I just kept thinking that first day, \u2018It\u2019s a mistake. There\u2019s been a mix-up.\u2019 I felt like that for a good few weeks afterwards, especially around the funeral... I found that very difficult and I couldn\u2019t come to terms with that at all. I guess it made it final. Sitting there, looking at her in the coffin... that was one of the hardest things I think I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nDolores\u2019 demos\n\nIt was at the funeral that O\u2019Riordan\u2019s brother first asked Hogan about his plans for the material that had been demoed for the Cranberries\u2019 next record. \u201cI was like, \u2018It\u2019s there, but I haven\u2019t had the guts to look at it yet\u2019,\u201d recalls Noel. \u201cHe said, \u2018She really wanted to do this album. You should listen through...\u2019\u201d\n\nHogan eventually built up the courage to compile the demos that, as per their habit, he and O\u2019Riordan had recorded remotely and traded between themselves.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I kind of realised what we had and what I felt was a very strong album,\u201d he says. \u201cDolores was such a strong vocalist that her demos were always really good.\u201d\n\nSome of the demos were very, very hard to listen to. You, obviously, then, start listening to everything with different ears, lyrically\n\nThe band had used vocal demos in final mixes on past records, so the precedent was already there. Bassist Mike Hogan (Noel\u2019s brother) and drummer Fergal Lawler were duly consulted and agreed, as was Dolores\u2019 family and the band\u2019s longtime producer Stephen Street.\n\n\u201cIt was Stephen who said, \u2018Look, I think we should do this now\u2019,\u201d says Noel. \u201cHe said, \u2018The momentum is there. You\u2019re very emotional about this and it might be the best time.\u2019 So I think it was April when we went into the studio... and it was really weird those few weeks. I kept thinking, \u2018She\u2019s going to call any day now.\u2019\n\n\u201cIn hindsight, I guess doing the album when we did, it was almost like therapy for us. We realised that, \u2018This is how it\u2019s going to be...\u2019 So I think it was right to do it when we did. If we were going in a year or two later, I don\u2019t think it would feel the same and we might not even do the album.\u201d\n\nOf course, alongside losing the one person he had written songs with for 30 years, repeatedly listening to the voice of a loved one so soon after their death must have presented a significant challenge.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard,\u201d Hogan acknowledges. \u201cIt was a case of having to walk out of the room and come back in again a few times. You think, \u2018I\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 Then you get the drum tracks up and the bass and you\u2019re going through it individually and then you bring in the voice... It was so fresh and raw. Some of them were very, very hard to listen to. You, obviously, then, start listening to everything with different ears, lyrically.\u201d\n\nIndeed, listening to the resulting album, In The End, it is nigh-on impossible to avoid applying new posthumous meaning to O\u2019Riordan\u2019s lyrics. All Over Now is ostensibly the story of a tumultuous and abusive relationship, but the repeated refrains of \u201cdo you remember?\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s all over now\u201d almost wilfully veer into new context.\n\nA small mercy of its tragic conception is that the forced decision to rely on demo recordings ultimately benefits the album, roughing up a sound that has grown slicker over the intervening decades, recalling the band\u2019s early years as painfully shy indie outsiders in the process.\n\nThe artwork - a mocked-up group of four \u2018kid Cranberries\u2019 holding cardboard instruments and mics - further reinforces that link to their origins in late-80s Limerick. Back then, it was a school friend passing Noel a Cure compilation that first sparked his obsession with guitar music. He had been playing for less than a year when the band started in 1989 and a cardboard guitar doesn\u2019t seem too far from the truth.\n\n\u201cMy parents bought me this big sunburst guitar that didn\u2019t even have a name on it,\u201d recalls Noel of his first years as a guitarist.\n\n\u201cWhen we did our first demo, I used it and it sounded more like a banjo, to be honest! I learned on that thing and I did have it for a few years before I could afford the first proper guitar that I still use today, which was a Telecaster. When we got signed, the minute we got a bit of money, I went up to London and bought a 1973 Telecaster. I still have that to this day and I use it all the time.\u201d\n\nOn the outside\n\nThe band were discovered relatively quickly - an early demo caught the ear of a few labels and they signed to Island in 1991 - so that unbranded guitar didn\u2019t last long, yet it never felt like entirely plain sailing for The Cranberries. Perhaps due to an existence entirely outside of the London music and media bubble, the four-piece seemed dogged by an almost group-wide inferiority complex.\n\nWe were very aware - myself and the two boys, especially - that we hadn\u2019t been playing that long\n\n\u201cWe were not the most obvious rockstars,\u201d admits Noel, chuckling. \u201cWe were very quiet. You had to drag conversation from us. We were not confident. We were very aware - myself and the two boys, especially - that we hadn\u2019t been playing that long. You felt like an imposter at times. We had all this fame or whatever and the band were huge but I\u2019d only been playing two or three years. You don\u2019t have the confidence to go, \u2018Aren\u2019t I brilliant?\u2019\n\n\u201cDolores had been playing since she was a kid and, musically, she was miles ahead of the three of us at that time. We had a lot of catching up to do, but even then Dolores was very shy in her personality at that time. She sang with her back to the audience.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s like anything, you do enough of it and you start to get used to it. I hated it at the beginning, the live side of it. I\u2019d be fine until about 6 o\u2019clock in the evening and then you\u2019d feel that sick feeling coming on you again - and all you ever think about is what\u2019s going to go wrong at the gig.\n\n\u201cYou never think: \u2018I can go on and nothing\u2019s going to happen - it\u2019s just going to be a gig.\u2019 But as time goes on you get used to it. [It wasn\u2019t until] the second album we felt, \u2018Actually, people like what we\u2019re doing, so maybe don\u2019t be so self-conscious about the whole thing\u2019.\u201d\n\nIt was ultimately to be success in the US that provided that vindication, with four introvert kids from Limerick succeeding where umpteen mouthy Brit-poppers so feted by the UK music press of the time had failed.\n\nAmerican dream\n\n\u201cThe first album came out and it died a death on this side of the world,\u201d says Noel. \u201cWe were in Europe at the time when we got the call about America - that we just needed to drop everything and come over, that Linger was doing really well on college radio. So we arrived in Denver, Colorado for the first gig [14 June 1993]. We were opening up for The The and I\u2019ll never forget it. Four days earlier we were the opening act on a tour where we were playing to five people each night and no one knew any of the songs. And we didn\u2019t think we\u2019d have a long career doing this because of that.\n\nWe went out that first night [in America] and the place just went crazy. We couldn\u2019t believe it\n\n\u201cBut we went out that first night [in America] and the place just went crazy. We couldn\u2019t believe it. We started with Linger and they knew all the lyrics. It was night and day to what we were used to. It\u2019s hard to explain how much of a change it was. Only a couple of years earlier I was in my bedroom trying to figure out the chords to the most basic of songs.\u201d\n\nAn astonishing 40 million in album sales and five top 20 albums on the Billboard chart followed in the intervening decades. In The End, however, is their best record since 1994\u2019s No Need To Argue - a fitting tribute to those career highs.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough call as to whether the return to form makes O\u2019Riordan\u2019s passing harder to take, or if the record\u2019s qualities are the result of her bandmates paying her the best compliment they can in their performances. Regardless, the decision to persevere seems utterly justified.\n\nA final tribute...\n\n\u201cIn The End, the title track and the last one on the album - that kind of sums up everything,\u201d reflects Noel. \u201cThe band, everything we hoped it would be and how when we got it, it\u2019s not what you expect... It was the last song we recorded together. You\u2019re sitting there listening to that lyric and I\u2019m looking at the other two going: this is the end of it here, for the three of us, sitting and recording together as The Cranberries, this is the last time we\u2019ll do it - these few takes.\u201d\n\nA career in gear\n\n(Image credit: Greetsia Tent / Getty)\n\nNoel on the favourites behind The Cranberries\u2019 iconic sound\n\nVox AC30 & Fender Twin\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been mostly the same since the beginning: a Vox AC30 with a Fender Twin. Though for some of the heavier stuff, like Zombie, I\u2019ve used a Marshall JCM800. Otherwise we tend to drive the Vox for heavy sounds. We keep the Fender clean for the jingly stuff.\u201d\n\nTelecasters\n\n\u201cI have two main Telecasters. I have the original 1973 one that I bought in the early 90s, which is your bog standard Telecaster and then I\u2019ve got a Thinline Telecaster with humbuckers in it that I use for the heavier stuff.\u201d\n\nDOD FX68 Chorus\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t use a lot of pedals, but I have this old DOD chorus. It\u2019s cheap as anything, but it became very much a part of The Cranberries sound and it\u2019s on every album we\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nDolores\u2019 Gibson SG\n\n\u201cI used Dolores\u2019 white SG a fair bit on this album. Particularly, on the songs that Dolores wrote, I felt that if she was there she would have done this as a rhythm, so it was nice. I\u2019d never played it before because, you know, you can\u2019t be picking up other people\u2019s guitars!\u201d"}, {"url": "https://returnofrock.com/the-cranberries-albums-ranked/", "page_content": "The Cranberries were an Irish rock band formed in Limerick, Ireland in 1989 by lead singer Niall Quinn, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan, and drummer Fergal Lawler. Quinn was replaced as lead singer by Dolores O\u2019Riordan in 1990. The band officially classify themselves as an alternative rock group but incorporate aspects of indie pop, post-punk, folk-rock, and pop-rock into their sound. The Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?, which became a commercial success, and achieved five top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart: Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?, No Need to Argue, To the Faithful Departed, Bury the Hatchet and Stars: The Best of 1992-2002[ as well as having eight top 20 singles on the Modern Rock Tracks chart: \u201cLinger\u201d, \u201cDreams\u201d, \u201cZombie\u201d, \u201cOde to My Family\u201d, \u201cRidiculous Thoughts\u201d, \u201cSalvation\u201d, \u201cFree to Decide\u201d, and \u201cPromises\u201d.

Click to enjoy the anthems from the 90\u2019s!\n\n8. To the Faithful Departed (1996)\n\n\u201cThis album is incredible and very underrated. I think a few years ago when I first heard this album, the song that really kicked this album up for me was \u201cI Just Shot John Lennon\u201d. That song still sticks with me and makes me feel all sorts of emotions that I can\u2019t even describe without listening to the song. Shame that this release isn\u2019t given as much attention as albums like No Need to Argue.\u201d\n\n7. Roses (2012)\n\n\u201cRoses is contemplative and wistful and proves that when they\u2019re on fire, The Cranberries can still pack a musical punch. The problem is that some weeds are found among this bed of roses. This means that if there\u2019d been some careful pruning the band might have made something a little less disposable and a set more fragrant and evocative. Nevertheless, Roses will still prove a welcome gift by the group\u2019s core fans, because for some people the absence of this \u201cpresent\u201d would be a fate far worse than one that is occasionally lackluster.\u201d\n\nSee more: Linkin Park Albums Ranked\n\n6. Wake Up and Smell the Coffee (2001)\n\n\u201cWake Up and Smell the Coffee is obviously an album where the arrangements are designed to take a back seat the vocals. I\u2019ll give Dolores extra kudos for completely avoiding the \u201cyodeling\u201d this time around; the lack of such outbursts does make her sound significantly less distinctive, but I\u2019ve always felt that she\u2019s at her best when she sticks to the angelic dream pop delivery. She\u2019s also managed to rein in the preachiness that sank To the Faithful Departed, with \u201cTime Is Ticking Out\u201d (an apparent single\u2026) being the only track here that reeks of in-your-face, Bono-esque social activism. Unfortunately, all of these potential virtues do reinforce the record\u2019s identity as \u201cboring\u201d, \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cmiddle-of-the-road\u201d. I suppose that makes Wake Up and Smell the Coffee the most adult-oriented record of the Cranberries\u2019 career, which is fine if you grew up with the band but undoubtedly made the group harder to embrace for the next generation of potential fans.\u201d\n\n5. Bury the Hatchet (1999)\n\n\u201cBury The Hatchet is more uniform than it\u2019s predecessor To the Faithful Departed with no odd or experimental tracks. I was actually surprised how much I enjoyed this album. The melodies, despite being very simple, are catchy and engaging. The same could be said about Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s unique voice. She does a fine job throughout Bury The Hatchet and is responsible for all of the lyrics and most of the songwriting efforts as well.\u201d\n\n4. Something Else (2017)\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a way to make a mark with new and old fans then The Cranberries have undoubtedly set the benchmark in 2017. Nearly 25 years after they released their debut album to the world, comes Something Else \u2013 an acoustic over-brushing both pertinent and rich. Featuring select hits from their back catalogue and a few new treasures, you can expect a new experience from their most cherished and beautifully crafted song gems.\u201d\n\nSee more: Weezer Albums Ranked\n\n3. In the End (2019)\n\n\u201cNo track has this effect more than the final one, \u2018In The End\u2019, the namesake of the album. \u201cThey can never take your spirit,\u201d O\u2019Riordan sings on the chorus, reminding us that even if the journey is over, there will always be a way to live on. Which is exactly how she will be remembered. After all, there is no end to a timeless legacy.\u201d\n\n2. No Need to Argue (1994)\n\n\u201cDolores O\u2019Riordan sings with an Irish accent and rapid switches between chest and head register. Their music combines electric and acoustic guitar with electronic string arrangements, ranging from catchy pop tunes to more meditative melodies. In Ode to My Family the singer thinks back of the traditional Irish family she left to become a rock singer. I Can\u2019t Be with You expresses frustration over a broken relationship. The vehement anti-war song Zombie was inspired by two child victims from an IRA bombing in Warrington, England. Repeated syllables make it sound obsessive. The \u201czombie\u201d could be someone who\u2019s traumatized by the war violence, which makes it a protest against the madness of war in general. Over a sober accompaniment of sustained chords the title track describes the transition from anger to acceptance after a break-up. They found a good middle between their entertaining and their activist side.\u201d\n\n1. Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can\u2019t We?

Famous all over the world for their committed lyrics on the Irish issue, and their incisive rock, The Cranberries is a legendary band, in the same lineage as a band like U2.\n\nCranberries career\n\nAn Irish band with a recognizable musical signature\n\nZombie, Just My Imagination\u2026 These are all hits that revealed the Cranberries. But what is the story of this mythical band? How did they start?\n\nIt all began in Limerick, in 1989. At the time, 4 Irish people decided to create a small rock band called \u201cThe Cranberries Saw Us\u201d. It was then composed of :\n\nNoel Anthony Hogan (guitarist)\n\nMichel G\u00e9rard Hogan (bass player),\n\nFergal Patrick Lawler (drummer)\n\nNiall Quinn (singer)\n\nUnfortunately, Niall Quinn left the band a few months later, forcing the rest of the members to find a new singer. After much searching, the singer turned out to be a singer in the person of Dolores O\u2019Riordan. Fascinated by music since the age of 3, the young woman brought a new life to the band, which decided to shorten the name \u201cThe Cranberries Saw Us\u201d to \u201cThe Cranberries\u201d.\n\nDolores then starts writing based on a model from the previous group. She refined the track Linger, and produced such an exciting track that Island Records signed with the band. The first single is then released: \u201cUncertain\u201d which was a first failure. The band then decides to start again on new bases by separating from their manager. They record their first album in March 1993 \u201cEverybody Else Is Doing It,So Why Can\u2019t We? The success is mitigated, and the band doesn\u2019t manage to break through immediately\u2026\n\nTo speed things up, The Cranberries go on tour in the States to support The and Suede. The American public\u2019s welcome is much warmer there, and MTV sees in them a promising band. To give them a boost, the music channel then regularly broadcasts the video clip \u201cLinger\u201d. The success was immediate: the single was released in eighth place, and sales took off: it was the beginning of their celebrity!\n\nIn July 94 Dolores O\u2019Riordan married the future manager of the group: Don Burton, former manager of Duran Duran.\n\nIn the autumn of 1994, the group released their second album, \u201cNo Need to Argue\u201d, which was to be their greatest success. The single \u201cZombie\u201d, dedicated to the conflict in Northern Ireland, found an international echo and reached the top of the charts. An international tour followed, then the release in 1996 of a third album, which this time didn\u2019t find the success they had hoped for.\n\nIn April 99, a 4th album is released : \u201cBury the Hatchet\u201d. The success comes back, and the album sells more than 3,500,000 copies. Then 2001 saw the release of \u201cWake Up and Smell the Coffee\u201d, which went down well.\n\nIn 2003, the Cranberries announced their separation and Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s upcoming solo career. They did not reunite again until 2009, to the great joy of their fans. In 2012, they released their 6th album, \u201cRoses\u201d, then \u201cSomething Else\u201d in 2017.\n\nUnfortunately, Dolores O\u2019Riordan died in London at the age of 46 on January 15, 2018, leaving behind a band that had lost its most famous member. Her sudden death caused a great deal of emotion in Ireland, as well as in the rest of the world\u2026\n\nCranberries Discography"}, {"url": "https://www.muzplay.net/en/musica/the-cranberries", "page_content": "Irish alternative pop/rock band The Cranberries were formed in 1989 by brothers Noel and Mike Hogan, guitar and bass respectively. At first the group was called The Cranberry Saw Us and the group's original vocalist was called Niall. In 1990, drummer Fergal Lawler joined the band. And, in the sequence, with the departure of Niall, Dolores O'Riordan was added as a vocalist by presenting a rudimentary version of \"Linger\", a song that would become one of the group's hits. O'Riordan's voice has become the most distinctive element in the group's music.\n\nAlready under the name of The Cranberries, the band sent a demo tape with versions of the songs \"Linger\" and \"Dreams\" to UK record labels. This demo stood out in the British press and there were several proposals from record labels, but the band ended up signing with Island Records. In 1993 the first album came out, entitled Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? and produced by Stephen Street, best known for his work with the Smiths. This first album became a great success primarily in the United States, pulled by the singles \"Linger\" and \"Dreams\". Only in early 1994, The Cranberries started to take off in the UK.\n\nIn September 1994 the second album was released. No Need to Argue brought the hits \"Zombie\" and \"Ode to My Family\". The first two albums sold millions of copies, making the band one of the most successful bands of the 1990s. The third studio album, To the Faithful Departed (1996), was released amid rumors about a possible departure for vocalist Dolores O 'Riordan. This Work did not achieve the same success as the previous albums. The band also released the albums Bury the Hatchet (1999) and Wake Up and Smell the Coffee (2001). A collection of hits and music videos entitled Stars - The Best of 1992-2002 was released in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, the band announced a career break. In 2007, Dolores O'Riordan released the solo album Are You Listening?. In November 2009, The Cranberries announced the return to the stage, for a tour of the United States and Europe. Roses, the group's sixth studio album, was released in February 2012. In 2017, the band released Something Else, an album that features three new songs and 10 hits in acoustic versions.\n\nOn January 15, 2018, Dolores O'Riordan was found dead, aged 46, in a hotel room in London, where she was meeting for a recording session. On September 6, 2018, it was revealed that she had drowned in the bathtub of her hotel room due to alcohol intoxication.\n\nAfter O'Riordan's death, the band's remnants started working with producer Stephen Street on some demos recordings produced with the vocal O'Riordan. The result came out in April 2019. The band released In the End and announced their end."}, {"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Copycat_(The_Cranberries_song)", "page_content": "Bury the Hatchet is the fourth studio album by Irish alternative rock[15] band the Cranberries, released on 19 April 1999.

A band that unified irresistible melodic guitar work with the distinctive, unique vocals of Dolores O\u2019Riordan, they would rise to international fame thanks to hits such as 1992\u2019s \u201cDreams,\u201d 1993\u2019s \u201cLinger,\u201d 1994\u2019s \u201cZombie,\u201d 1999\u2019s \u201cPromises,\u201d plus a whole lot more. Attaining platinum-selling albums, topping charts internationally, plus touring the world, The Cranberries have a legacy that reaches far and deep. Showing no signs of slowing down, their story came to an abrupt halt when their lead lady O\u2019Riordan tragically passed away at the age of 46.\n\nA terrible loss for friends, family, her devoted bandmates, and fans, most figured The Cranberries were all but done. Fortunately for everyone, the band was indeed in the process of writing/recording new music for another album prior to O\u2019Riordan\u2019s death. Left with the hard decision of whether or not to put the music out, inevitably they felt it best to honor their late vocalist with one final release.\n\nEntitled In The End, the album has received an amazing response and marks the band\u2019s first ever to be nominated for a Grammy. A bittersweet time for The Cranberries, founding Guitarist Noel Hogan recently sat down to talk about the history of The Cranberries, losing Dolores O\u2019Riordan, the work behind their last album, plus a whole lot more.\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 The Cranberries came together three decades ago. In that time the band would go on to major success with multi-platinum album sales, chart-topping singles, and international touring. First, briefly tell us, what has the journey been like?\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 To say amazing really doesn\u2019t do it justice. We were four really young kids who liked a lot of English/Indie music in the \u201980s. Then, through a few bands we all commonly liked, we formed this band trying to do our version of that; it was a hobby for us. We would rehearse on Sunday and Tuesday in Limerick where we grew up. Within a few years the songs we had written as kids everyone in the world knew and we were headlining massive tours. It all seemed a bit surreal.\n\nIt was great, it was amazing. Obviously when you start a band you kind of dream these things would happen, but you don\u2019t think they will. Here we are 30 years later and it has kind of left a legacy at this point. For us it\u2019s still, you kind of pinch yourself a little to think that\u2019s you, that\u2019s your life, you were involved in that; it is almost as like it happened to somebody else, it\u2019s just you know a lot about it. It\u2019s something I guess we never expected and never fully got used to, but have had just an amazing ride with the whole thing.\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 It is truly amazing. One thing that has always stood out for the band has been the blend of beautiful melodies with heavier guitars. Was that balance always important for you when writing music?\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 Yeah, it really was. The way I write the music, because I can\u2019t sing and I don\u2019t write lyrics, was the guitar melodies and writing that side of it was the music side of it. Because I was a guitar player you would end up kind of making things a bit heavy and kind of get that vibe going on. Then Dolores would have these almost Pop-like melodies over this with very sweet lyrics. You would have this bizarre music of the likeness of that and the heaviness of the music \u2013 it just seemed to kind of click with people.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t anything we set out, it wasn\u2019t preconceived we were going to do it this way. We genuinely wrote songs we liked, and we were just very lucky a lot of people liked it, as well. We didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but a lot of those earlier songs have really stood the test of time. That says a lot for not knowing what you\u2019re doing really.\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 They certainly have stood the test of time. Let\u2019s look back a little bit more. Dolores O\u2019Riordan was not originally the lead voice of the band when you began. Joining the band a year later, what was it like for you recruiting a new lead singer. Moreover, what lead to selecting Dolores as the voice of The Cranberries?\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 Myself and the two other boys in the bands all grew up together. A guy who lived near us was in another band, he sang with us for a while because he wanted to step out of that band and do something a bit different. A good thing about meeting Niall Quinn was he had experience in a band, and he kind of showed us how songs were structured and written. We actually had no idea: we bought instruments and started a band; we were really learning as we were going. Niall left, and a good 6-7 months went by where we were just an instrumental band. We had taken over: I had all these ideas for songs and there were songs that developed into these big instrumentals.\n\nIt was actually through Niall whose girlfriend at the time knew Dolores. I bumped into Niall one day and he said, \u201cMy girlfriend knows this girl who looking for a band, but they have to do originals; she doesn\u2019t want to be in a cover band.\u201d I said, \u201cYup, we\u2019re the people.\u201d She came in that very first day, sang a few songs \u2013 a Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor song and a song she had written herself. We had played some of the instrumental stuff and straight away she said, \u201cI think I can work with this.\u201d\n\nOf course when she sang we were all going, \u201cOkay, how come she\u2019s not already in a band?\u201d We couldn\u2019t believe it! It kicked from there. I gave her a cassette with a very basic guitar version of \u201cLinger\u201d on it. She took it away, came back two days later, and the version of \u201cLinger\u201d everybody knows was born that week and it never really changed from that moment on.\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 Wow, and as they say the rest is history. The band went on to a long career and released exceptional music. Let\u2019s look back at the albums: there was obviously progression from album to album. What was the progression like for the band and deciding what direction you wanted to go?\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 The great thing about having success very early on is that it allows you to go do your tours, you can relax, and you can make a living from the thing and focus on doing it. The down side is you put a lot of pressure on yourself to try and change it slightly every time and become better. Hopefully you are becoming a better musician anyway, but there is that pressure where you have three, four, five hits, now you want the sixth and seventh hits. That can be a mixed kind of bag. You can stay awake at night worried about that kind of thing. It can lead to all kinds of issues, and it did. Dolores and I, being the writers, found that pressure got a bit too much. They are not fun times but we got clever, took some time out, regrouped, came back to it again, and started writing the next album.\n\nYou want it to be a Cranberries album, but you don\u2019t want it to be the same as the last one. You are trying it far, but not too far where people would go, \u201cWhat the hell is this all about?\u201d I think if you listen to the albums back to back you do hear that progression, but it\u2019s never a massive jump where we did one kind of music and suddenly came out with a Dance album or something. It was always The Cranberries; you would know in the opening chords of any of our songs that it\u2019s us. Hopefully you try and craft the songwriting a bit more. Obviously playing all the time, especially since we toured constantly, you do get tighter as a band as well. It gets to the point where you can go into rehearsals and not even have to look at each other, you just know what people are going to do before they start doing it.\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 The results were always great. You mentioned taking some time off and a break. There was a period of time where the band was not actively touring or releasing new music. When the band regrouped around 2009 for a North American and European tour followed by an album release in 2012, what was it like getting back into the swing of things as a band?\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 It was great. I think it was six-seven years at that point and we had never broken up; we had just gotten to the point where we felt we had done everything we could. It became really like a job, but a job nobody wanted to go to. There was this mutual respect for each other where we said, \u201cWe need to get away from this awhile.\u201d We all went off and lived our lives, had kids, etc.\n\nAfter a long time you start to think that part of my life is probably over. Amazingly when you do get back together\u2026I remember the first day myself and the two boys knew we were going to do a tour, there was a demand for it. We got together in a place we had here in Limerick, and we were just going to rehearse and see how it went before we met Dolores; just to have the music side of it together. It was weird: after two hours it was like we had never taken a moment off. We playing songs we had not played in six-seven years, and somewhere in the back of your brain they were still there. They were rusty, but after a couple of days we were just as tight as we had been. That\u2019s amazing how that lives with you even though it\u2019s not something you think about every day and you had almost forgotten about that part of yourself.\n\nThen Dolores came on and we had the four of us in the room together and it felt like we had no time off. We were actually enjoying it again like we were in the early days. The minute you start doing a tour and you\u2019re back on the stage again, get over the nerves of the first night in particular, you start to enjoy it. Because of that you are able to go back and write. That wasn\u2019t even our plan at that point: it was just to tour and see how it went. That want in you to write again comes and suddenly without really thinking about it you have another album.\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 Yes, and speaking of which, three albums followed that return. Which leads us to the most recent, In The End was released in April of this year. This album comes with a heavy heart because it is the final with Dolores. There is obviously a level of grieving involved with someone who is your friend and bandmate for so long. Was it a challenge to decide to put this record out?\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 Yeah, it is one of the hardest things we had done. Dolores and I had started the June before that. She passed away in January of 2018, so we had kind of written all those songs and worked on that; the plan was to go around March or April to start the album. I had everything on this hard drive and you look at it everyday wondering should I open it up? Should I just forget about it? What should I do? Eventually when you get the guts up to start to go through it all and you realize how strong it is, then you start to go \u2013 what do we do now? Do we pursue this or do we leave it be? You second guess yourself and you don\u2019t know what the right thing to do is.\n\nIt was truly a group effort where I got the demos together the best I could, sent them to the boys, and we sent them to Stephen Street who produced the bulk of our albums. The four of us spoke a lot, kind of had different ideas, and Stephen\u2019s idea was you should do it now and not let time go by. Now looking back it feels as if that was our way of dealing with the whole thing, like therapy in some ways.\n\nIt was hard recording it, particularly the first few days. You do zone into that thing where you say, \u201cI want to make this the best I can.\u201d We all got into that headspace and we are really proud of the album now. We were worried about releasing it, because you don\u2019t know how people would take to it given the circumstances; you hope people would get what you were trying to do. Dolores was really so excited about these songs. Then something like this nomination we received does make you think we did the right thing, because this could have been on a hard-drive sitting on a shelf here forever with nobody hearing it. I think we feel we did the right thing.\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 The songs are fantastic. You did do the right thing, because this album gives fans time for closure: the music of The Cranberries is very personal for many fans, this gives them a chance to grieve and take these songs in.\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 That is what we found. We were worried, as I said, and suddenly you meet fans when we went around doing the promo and people left messages online. It hit the nerve we hoped it would, like a gift almost to them than anything that Dolores left this there. I think because the album is so strong, it got the point across. Whereas if it had been an album where we were thinking these songs aren\u2019t that great, it probably wouldn\u2019t have the effect it had; it would really look like you were releasing an album for the sake of it.\n\nWe thought long and hard are these songs strong enough. We genuinely believed at the time of recording it that it was up there with our best albums. I still stand by that now. I\u2019ve been working on this album since June of 2017, a pretty long time. I really am proud of it!\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 As you should be. You mentioned about being nominated for a Grammy. Well deserved and long overdue, you will be nominated for a Grammy in January 2020. Shockingly this is the first time The Cranberries have been nominated for a Grammy. How surprised are you for this nomination after all this time?\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 (Laughs) It\u2019s really shocking, I can\u2019t explain how shocking. For 30 years we have been doing this and it was not something that has ever really been on our radar. You are aware of the Grammys, but even when the band in the \u201990s were at the height of everything, it never really came up in the conversation. We were doing the promo of this album in February-March, it started to come up when we were doing different interviews at radio stations. You still don\u2019t think about it; we had never been nominated before, and what are the chances it is going to happen now at the very end of it all? Then surprise, surprise, we get this call out the blue. I genuinely think we were probably more surprised than anybody else.\n\nIt does validate that the decisions we made to get to this point of this album is you did the right thing to do it. I guess in a small way, because things have quieted down in the past few months, you almost felt like the album came out, did well, and we were starting to move on, and suddenly this brings it back up. It\u2019s nice, it really feels good.\n\nCryptic Rock \u2013 Let us hope you take home an award come January, the band deserves it! Beyond the music of The Cranberries, you have put out some fantastic music videos \u2013 \u201cZombie,\u201d \u201cAnimal Instinct,\u201d etc. These are very thoughtful music videos. What was the creative process like behind all these music videos?\n\nNoel Hogan \u2013 We were really lucky that we met some great directors over the years. On an album you would find somebody and then probably do 2 or 3 videos for that album with them to keep it coherent. That always seemed to work for us. We were lucky that we made videos at a time where record companies were willing to give a bit more of a budget than I think they are now. You would try and kind of push it as far as you could. In fairness, Dolores was great working with the directors, particularly because she had written the lyrics. She would explain, \u201cThis is the way I imagine this song, this is what the song is all about,\u201d and made sure the videos didn\u2019t drift away from that.\n\nAgain, it was something we didn\u2019t think we were going to make some great videos. They were just kind of an evil necessity \u2013 at one time you felt a video and you would kind of throw your eyes up. Then when you see the finished result, a lot of the time we were really happy with it. You have to trust the directors you work with, because they have a vision and they are trying to get it across. When you are doing stuff with green screen it can be hard to imagine. Most of the time we\u2019ve been really happy with them.\n\n\ufeff\n\nFor more on The Cranberries : cranberries.com | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n\nPurchase In The End :\n\n[amazon_link asins=\u2019B07MQ3K5N2,B07N3PGCW9,B07MM5X2ZJ,B07NRHGJHX,B07R92J5G3,B07R6B3PWM\u2019 template=\u2019ProductCarousel\u2019 store=\u2019crypticrock-20\u2032 marketplace=\u2019US\u2019 link_id=\u2019fceb5051-e188-4d95-93f3-ac885e917f31\u2032]\n\nRelated posts: No related posts."}, {"url": "https://www.radioswisspop.ch/en/music-database/band/24104893adafd06a6f0a84c66f4f17a9e56357/biography", "page_content": "The Cranberries are an Irish rock band who formed in Limerick in 1989. The band consists of lead singer Dolores O'Riordan, guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan, and drummer Fergal Lawler. Although widely associated with alternative rock, the band's sound also incorporates indie pop, post-punk, Irish folk, and pop rock elements.[1]\n\nThe Cranberries rose to international fame in the 1990s with their debut album, Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?, which became a commercial success. The Cranberries are one of the most successful rock acts of the '90s and have sold over 40 million records worldwide. The band has achieved four top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?; No Need to Argue, To the Faithful Departed and Bury the Hatchet)[2] and eight top 20 singles on the Modern Rock Tracks chart (\"Linger\", \"Dreams\", \"Zombie\", \"Ode to My Family\", \"Ridiculous Thoughts\", \"Salvation\", \"Free to Decide\", and \"Promises\").[2]\n\nIn early 2009, after a six-year hiatus, the Cranberries reunited and began a North American tour, followed by shows in Latin America and Europe.[3][4] The band recorded their sixth album Roses in May 2011, and released it on 27 February 2012. Something Else, an album covering earlier songs together with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, was released on 28 April 2017.[5]\n\nHistory\n\nFormation and early years (1989\u20131992)\n\nIn 1989, brothers Mike (bass) and Noel (guitar) Hogan formed The Cranberry Saw Us with drummer Fergal Lawler and singer Niall Quinn, in Limerick, Ireland. Less than a year later, Quinn left the band.[6] The remaining band members then placed an advertisement for a female singer. Dolores O'Riordan responded to the advertisement and auditioned by writing lyrics and melodies to some existing demos.[7] When she returned with a rough version of \"Linger\", she was hired, and they recorded Nothing Left At All, a three-track EP released on tape by local record label Xeric Records, which sold 300 copies.[7] The group changed their name to \"The Cranberries\". The owner of Xeric Studios, Pearse Gilmore, became their manager and provided the group with studio time to complete another demo tape, which he produced. It featured early versions of \"Linger\" and \"Dreams\", which were sent to record companies throughout the UK.[7]\n\nThis demo earned the attention of both the UK press and record industry and sparked a bidding war between major British record labels. Eventually, the group signed with Island Records.[7] The Cranberries headed back into studio with Gilmore as their producer to record their first EP Uncertain and created a music video for the title track, which was not released.[8] The EP received poor reviews in the press and led to tension between the group and Gilmore.[7] After a difficult recording session intended for their first Island records album in January 1992, the band scrapped their work and fired Gilmore.[6] After hiring Geoff Travis as their new manager, the Cranberries headed back into the studio in Dublin in March 1992 to restart working on their first LP with Stephen Street, who had previously worked with The Smiths.[6]\n\nDuring that time period, the Cranberries toured in Ireland and the UK, getting the attention of the British press. The band also recorded several studio and live sessions intended for Irish and British radio and television shows, including 2fm's The Dave Fanning Show and BBC Radio 1's John Peel Show.\n\nMainstream success (1993\u20131995)\n\nThe band's debut single \"Dreams\" was released in September 1992, followed by their first full-length album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? in March 1993.[6] Neither the album nor the single gained much attention, nor did a second single, \"Linger\". When the band embarked on a tour supporting Suede, they then caught the attention of MTV, which put their videos into heavy rotation. Although \"Linger\" was first released in the UK in February 1993, peaking at 74, it was later re-issued in February 1994 peaking at 14. This was followed by Dreams (released again in May 1994, peaking at No. 27) which helped their debut album to top the UK Album Chart,[9] becoming one of only five artists to ever achieve a re-entry at that chart position.[6]\n\nThe group reunited with Street for No Need to Argue, which was released in late 1994. Boasting a slightly harder, more streamlined sound, the record debuted at No. 6 on the US charts and eventually outsold its predecessor. Within a year it went triple platinum, spawning the number one hit \"Zombie\" and the No. 11 \"Ode to My Family\" on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.[2]\n\nIn 1995, the band continued to tour, and released two more singles \"I Can't Be with You\" and \"Ridiculous Thoughts\". The album went 5\u00d7 platinum in Canada, platinum in Switzerland, and 7\u00d7 platinum in the United States.[10][11][12]\n\nMiddle era (1996\u20132000)\n\nThe band's heavier third album To the Faithful Departed failed to garner the same reception as its predecessors. Upon release the album entered the charts, peaking at No. 2 in the UK and No. 4 on the Billboard 200.[2][9] Despite favorable reviews, the album did not match the sales of No Need to Argue. The album only went double platinum in the US and Gold in the UK.[10][13] The first single from the album was \"Salvation\" which topped the Modern Rock Tracks chart.[2] The second single from the album was \"Free to Decide\"; the single's peak in the UK was 33[9] and placing on the Billboard Hot 100. In late 1996, the group cancelled their Australian and European tour, sparking rumors that O'Riordan was about to launch a solo career. In November 1996 \"When You're Gone\" was released as a single in the United States, peaking at 22 on the Hot 100.[2]\n\nIn 1999, the group released Bury the Hatchet. The first single \"Promises\" was released in February. \"Promises\" would be the only single from the album to chart in the US and last single before their hiatus.[2] The album peaked at 7 in the UK and 13 in the US[2][9] and was certified gold in the US.[10] The second single from the album was \"Animal Instinct\", which didn't chart in the UK, although it did chart in France, Austria and many others.[14] The third and fourth singles were \"Just My Imagination\" and \"You & Me\", respectively. The band had a guest appearance on popular television series Charmed, performing \"Just My Imagination\" on the fifth episode of the second season, \"She's a Man, Baby, a Man!\". The group started a world tour in April 1999 and it finished in July 2000. It was the biggest and most successful tour of the Cranberries' career. The tour brought them back to Ireland for their first date since May 2000. They performed at Millstreet in County Cork. As the tour rolled on, the band released Bury The Hatchet \u2013 The Complete Sessions, a double CD featuring B-sides as well as live tracks taken from a show in Paris.\n\nLater years (2001\u20132003)\n\nIn October 2001, the album Wake Up and Smell the Coffee was released. The band's old producer Stephen Street had returned and produced their new music video. The album peaked at 46 on the Billboard 200[2] and reached No. 61 in the UK.[9] The first single released from the album was \"Analyse\", which didn't chart in the UK but did chart in the US Adult Top 40 at a peak of 26.[2][9] In January 2002, they released the second single \"Time Is Ticking Out\", and some months later another one, \"This Is the Day\". Neither song charted.\n\nThe following year a greatest hits album was released entitled Stars \u2013 The Best of 1992\u20132002 which was released alongside eponymous DVD of music videos. The album peaked in the UK at 20.[9] The song \"Stars\" was released as a single from that album. They started a European tour in mid October 2002, which ended in December of the same year.\n\nAt the end of February 2003, the Cranberries started working with Stephen Street and debuted their work for the first time in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 29 May 2003 performing the songs \"Astral Projection\" and \"In it Together\".[15] That September, the band announced they were taking some time to pursue individual careers and scrapped sessions for a sixth studio release.\n\nHiatus and solo careers (2004\u20132008)\n\nDolores O'Riordan started collaborating with other musicians in 2004 before launching her solo career with the album Are You Listening? in 2007, following it with No Baggage in 2009. Dolores O'Riordan performed \"Linger\" in the 2006 movie Click.\n\nNoel Hogan started a new project called Mono Band, whose first full-length self-titled album saw a limited release in 2005. He went on to form Arkitekt with singer-songwriter Richard Walters.[16] He has also been working as a producer with Supermodel Twins, from his native Limerick and Remma. Fergal Lawler was a member of The Low Network, whose first album was released in 2007. He has also worked with Walter Mitty and the Realists[17] as well as Last Days Of Death Country[18][19] as both producer and musician.\n\nReunion and Roses (2009\u20132015)\n\nThe Cranberries reunited in January 2009 to celebrate O'Riordan becoming an Honorary Patron of University Philosophical Society (Trinity College, Dublin). While the group indicated at the time that this did not signify an official reunion, on 25 August 2009, in anticipation of the release of No Baggage, O'Riordan announced that the Cranberries would be reuniting for a North American and European tour.[20] O'Riordan indicated that the band would be playing songs from her solo albums and a lot of the Cranberries' classic hits as well as some new group compositions.\n\nThe Cranberries recorded Roses at the Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, (Canada) from 18 April[21] to 15 May[22] 2011 with Stephen Street,[21] who previously collaborated with the band on their first, second and fifth albums. The Cranberries worked on 15 tracks during the Roses session, although not all were included on the album.[23] The album was released on 27 February 2012.[24]\n\nO'Riordan started legal proceedings against Noel Hogan in October 2013.[25] The case was struck out in July 2015 and the cause was not divulged.[26]\n\nO'Riordan began recording new material with D.A.R.K. in April 2014.[27]\n\nSomething Else and cancellation of 2017 Tour\n\nA new acoustic Cranberries album titled Something Else was released on 28 April 2017 through BMG.[5] Something Else featured orchestral arrangements of prior releases, and three new songs.\n\nWith the release of the new album, the group announced a tour which was to include dates in Europe, parts of the UK, and North America. The shows were scheduled in smaller venues, with live orchestral accompaniment. However, in May 2017, shortly into the European tour, The Cranberries had to cancel the remainder of the European dates as O\u2019Riordan had health issues. The North American tour dates were cancelled in July when her recovery had not progressed enough for her to participate.[28] As of December 2017, no new or rescheduled tour dates were announced.\n\nStyle\n\nTheir music has been likened to singers such as Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor and Siouxsie and the Banshees.[29] O'Riordan stated her singing style incorporating yodeling was inspired by her father who used to sing \"The Lonesome Cattle Call\": \"I just kept with my father all the time, just copying him and eventually I learned how to do it. Then over the years there were artists like Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor and Siouxsie from Siouxsie and the Banshees and even Peter Harvey was doing it. It was something that you could work into The Cranberries\u2019 format because a lot of that was used in religious Irish music.\"[30]\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nBrit Awards\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 1995 Themselves Best International Group Nominated\n\nIvor Novello Awards\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 1995 \"Zombie\" Best Contemporary Song Nominated 1997 Themselves International Achievement Won\n\nJuno Awards\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 1996 No Need to Argue Best Selling Album (Foreign or Domestic) Won\n\nMTV Europe Music Awards\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 1995 \"Zombie\" Best Song Won\n\nMTV Video Music Awards\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 1994 \"Linger\" Viewer's Choice (Europe) Nominated 1995 \"Zombie\" Nominated Best Alternative Video Nominated 1996 \"Salvation\" Best Art Direction Nominated\n\nBand members\n\nCurrent members\n\nDolores O'Riordan - lead vocals, rhythm & lead guitar, keyboards (1990-2003, 2009-present)\n\nNoel Hogan - lead & rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1989-2003, 2009-present)\n\nMike Hogan - bass, backing vocals (1989-2003, 2009-present)\n\nFergal Lawler - drums (1989-2003, 2009-present)\n\nFormer members\n\nNiall Quinn - lead vocals, rhythm & lead guitar (1989-1990)\n\nTouring musicians\n\nRussell Burton \u2013 keyboards (1996\u20132003, 2012) , rhythm guitar (2012)\n\n, rhythm guitar Steve DeMarchi \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1996\u20132003)\n\nDenny DeMarchi \u2013 keyboards, rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2009\u20132011)\n\nJohanna Cranitch \u2013 backing vocals (2012)\n\nDiscography\n\nEverybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?

The group recruited Dolores O'Riordan as singer soon after forming. The band went on to sell in excess of 40 million records worldwide. In total, Hogan has released six albums with The Cranberries.\n\nThe Cranberries reformed after a hiatus in 2009.\n\nOn 15 January 2018, lead singer Dolores O'Riordan was reported dead at age 46, putting an end to the band's career.\n\nSolo work\n\nWith The Cranberries on hiatus from 2003\u20132009, Hogan turned to focus on his own music. He began working with programmer Matt Vaughan, who had already done work on unreleased Cranberries songs and Dolores O'Riordan's solo material. Mono Band was born with Noel as the sole band member. With vocals being supplied by Richard Walters,[1] Alexandra Hamnede, Kate Havnevik, and other guest artists, Noel worked with Cranberries' veteran producer Stephen Street to compile a mix of 12 tracks. Working on his side project at the same time, saw their resulting debut album, Mono Band, released on 20 May 2005. Hogan and Mono Band vocalist Richard Walters went on to form Arkitekt. Arkitekt released two EPs at that time in 2009, working on new material.\n\nHogan's work independent of The Cranberries has been released on his own label, Gohan Records and is published through Fairwood Music (UK) Ltd for the world.[2]\n\nHogan has also been producing bands on the local music scene of Limerick. Gohan Records has recently released, in collaboration with Limerick Live 95FM's Green and Live show, Tonelist, a collection featuring better-known and up and coming musicians in the Limerick music scene.[3]\n\nMusical equipment\n\nHogan's musical equipment that he has used with The Cranberries over the years includes:\n\nGuitars\n\nGibson Les Paul Custom\n\nPRS Guitars Artist 22\n\nFender Jaguar\n\nFender Telecaster\n\nFender Stratocaster\n\nGibson Jumbo Acoustic guitar\n\nTaylor Jumbo Acoustic guitar\n\nGibson ES-335\n\nAmplifiers\n\nVox AC30\n\nFender Twin Reverb\n\nMarshall 30th Anniversary 3-channel head\n\nMarshall 4x12 speaker cabinets\n\nDiezel VH4 amp head\n\nMesa Boogie Mark II\n\nEffects\n\nRoland RE-301 Chrous Echo unit\n\nIbanez Tube Screamer Overdrive pedal\n\nPro Co RAT Distortion pedal\n\nElectro-Harmonix Big Muff Fuzz pedal\n\nZvex Fuzz factory pedal\n\nDunlop Manufacturing Tremolo pedal\n\nDigiTech Whammy pedal\n\nElectro-Harmonix Mirco-Synth pedal\n\nWatkins Copicat Delay pedal\n\nLine 6 Echo Park delay pedal"}]}
