{"Paul Y. R. Waddington has written extensively on the topics of evolutionary theory, the philosophy of biology, and the philosophy of technology.": [{"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40656-018-0228-8", "page_content": "3.1 First encounter: epigenetics as a Janus coin\n\nFor Waddington, Spemann and Mangold\u2019s discovery of the inductor and their subsequent success in the embryological literature couldn\u2019t remain without consequences for the advances in another field also expanding at this time: genetics. For instance, Waddington quickly assumed that common definitions in the emergent field of genetics, such as those of the genotype and the phenotype, should be amended. Therefore he claimed that:\n\nThe genotype was originally defined as the sum total of the genes contained in the fertilized egg (Johannsen 1911), but the word is usually used to refer comprehensively to the whole genetic system of the zygote considered both as a set of potentialities for developmental reactions and as a set of hereditable units; that is to say, it includes not only the mere sum of the genes, but also their arrangement, as expressed in position effects, translocations, inversions, etc. (Waddington 1939, p. 155).\n\nHe argued that if one wished to emphasize the \u201cepigenetic process\u201d (i.e. the developmental process), the definition of the genotype should not focus only on the \u201cfactors\u201d at the origin of the traits (i.e. the genes) but it should also mention the potentialities of these factors. Conversely, he considered that there was no reason to exclude from the definition of the phenotype the developmental processes: \u201cThe phenotype in fact must be used as a name for the whole set of characters of an organism, considered as a developing entity\u201d (Waddington 1939, p. 155).\n\nWaddington believed that the context in which Johannsen had defined these two notions of \u201cgenotype\u201d and \u201cphenotype\u201d was the growing interest of evolutionists for genetics instead of development. Therefore, he thought that he had to move the geneticists\u2019 eyes toward developmental issues. For this purpose he highlighted: \u201cthe concepts of genotype and phenotype are defined in the first place in relation to differences between whole organisms. They are not adequate or appropriate for the consideration of the development of differences within a single organism\u201d (Waddington 1939, p.156). In other words, he claimed that geneticists still had blind spots and that embryology, through the study of epigenesis, could help them opening up some interesting horizons.\n\nHe finally gave an alternate notion for the genotype\u2014the epigenotype\u2014more appropriate, in his opinion, to bring together genetics and epigenesis:\n\nOne might say that the set of organizers and organizing relations to which a certain piece of tissue will be subject during development make up its \u201cepigenetic constitution\u201d or \u201cepigenotype\u201d [and] then the appearance of a particular organ is the product of the genotype and the epigenotype, reacting with the external environment. In transplantation experiments, [\u2026] it is the epigenotype which is altered. (Waddington 1939, p. 156).\n\nIn this quotation, it clearly appears that Waddington didn\u2019t have in mind, at this point at least, to merge with this new notion of \u201cepigenotype\u201d the old one of \u201cgenotype\u201d. He thought that the two instances were co-acting, while serving different purposes. Waddington didn\u2019t think that Johannsen was wrong when he defined the genotype and the phenotype, he only thought that something was missing in the whole picture of the underlying organizers and this \u201csomething\u201d was the epigenotype constituent. The genotype could say something about the underlying characteristics of the phenotypes, while the epigenotype constituent could say something about the underlying characteristics of the organism in general. In other words, Waddington did not want to abandon the old notion of genotype in favor of epigenotype.\n\nIn 1940, he published another book entitled Organisers and Genes in which he clearly summarized his position. In this book, Waddington used two figures to explain his view concerning his understanding of epigenetic process (see Figs. 3 and 4). Gilbert in 1991 and more recently Baedke in 2013 have already precisely analyzed Waddington\u2019s use of these two figures. Gilbert has argued that Waddington used a branch-track diagram instead of a linear one (Figs. 3 and 4) because of.\n\nFig. 3 Alternative phenotypes in response to diffusible substance. Figure from Waddington 1940, (\u201cThe formation of eye colors in Drosophila\u201d) Full size image\n\nFig. 4 Alternative phenotypes as a result of developmental process. Figure from Waddington 1940, (\u201cThe aristopedia developmental track system\u201d) Full size image\n\n[\u2026] his desire to synthesize embryology and genetics. Waddington would use the branched-track diagram to show that the theories in genetics and the theories in embryology were saying the same thing [\u2026] To do this, he put the genetic data into the branch-track diagram that was already commonplace in embryology [\u2026] Waddington will use this concept of bifurcation to show that Drosophila genetics and amphibian embryology were talking about the same things. (Gilbert 1991a, p. 146).\n\nThe two figures were saying the same things because in embryology and in genetics the internal inducer determines the fate of the cells.Footnote 11 For instance concerning the branch-track diagram, Fig. 3 represents alternative phenotypes in response to diffusible substances while Fig. 4 represents alternative phenotype as a result of developmental process. Waddington thought that these processes were two similar processes, but described differently.\n\nIn the frontispiece of the 1940\u2019s book appeared a drawing from Waddington\u2019s friend and artist John Piper, entitled \u201cthe Epigenetic Landscape\u201d and with a caption referring to a section of the book devoted to the topic (see Fig. 5).\n\nFig. 5 The Epigenetic Landscape, a drawing from John Piper. Drawing from Waddington 1940 Full size image\n\nIn his 2013 paper, Baedke has explained why and how Waddington has used different representations to illustrate what he called the epigenetic landscape. He has shown that Waddington\u2019s epigenetic landscape images were used \u201cto give the scientist an intuitive understanding of the overall system\u201d (Baedke 2013, p. 761). For Baedke it was a way for Waddington to enable biologists to grasp a complex yet little-known phenomenon (here, the relationship between genes and embryonic development) (Baedke 2013, p. 759).\n\nIn 1939, Waddington already summarized his general conception of the epigenetic landscape in the following manner:\n\nPerhaps a fuller picture would be given by a system of valleys diverging down an inclined plane. The inclined plane symbolizes the tendency for a developing piece of tissue to move towards a more adult state. The sides of the valleys symbolize the fact that developmental tracks are, in some sense, equilibrium states. (Waddington 1939, p. 92).\n\nAt this moment, and as I mentioned earlier, the adjective \u201cepigenetic\u201d was used in connection to the developmental process. The drawing helped to specify the nature of the connection: all the developmental processes happening between an embryonic state and an adult state (i.e. what Waddington calls here \u201cthe tendency for a developing piece of tissue\u201d). Therefore, the \u201cepigenetic landscape\u201d could be understood either as the visualization of a \u201cdevelopmental pathway\u201d or as the visualization of a \u201cgenetic sequence\u201d but not really as a unified picture.\n\nThe epigenetic landscape had been a recurrent notion and picture in Waddington\u2019s mind. Therefore, his constant use of the notion shows Waddington\u2019s sustained willingness, from this moment and until the end of his life, to reunite development and genetics within a single framework. While in 1939 and 1940, the relationship between these two poles still looked like a Janus, a couple of years later, the connection changed a bit when Waddington defined again the concept of epigenotype in a new article he devoted to the topic.\n\n3.2 Second encounter: the misunderstood concept of Epigenotype\n\nIn 1942, Waddington published a small article in which he explained that in between the genotype and the phenotype lays a set of complex developmental processes that he called the epigenotype. He argued that these processes should be studied in order to better understand the hereditary constitution of the organism, which was, he claimed, the basic subject matter of genetics. However, in the same paper he also justified the reasons why, for the purpose of a study of inheritance, the relationship between the phenotypes and the genotypes could be left comparatively uninvestigated:\n\nWe need merely to assume that changes in the genotype produce correlated changes in the adult phenotype, but the mechanisms of this correlation need not concern us. (Waddington 1942, p. 10).\n\nIn this sentence Waddington expressed himself as a geneticist but in the following one he already took a position \u201cfrom a wider biological point of view\u201d assuming that the issue concerning the relationship between the phenotypes and the genotypes was \u201cof a crucial importance, since it [was] the kernel of the whole problem of development.\u201d For Waddington, this point was central,Footnote 12 especially because he claimed that it could shed light on the role of development in evolutionary mechanisms.\n\nIn Waddington\u2019s mind such a goal could be reached in two steps. The first one involved the description of what could be observed at the developmental level. He called this \u201cphenogenetics\u201d (referring to Valentin Haecker German expression \u201cPhaenogenetik\u201d, 1918). The second step, even more crucial for Waddington, was to \u201cdiscover the causal mechanisms at work, and to relate them as far as possible to what experimental embryology [had] already revealed of the mechanics of development\u201d (Waddington 1942, p. 10). Waddington gave the name \u201cepigenetics\u201d to such studies in order again to put into focus epigenesis: the developmental processes and their underlying mechanisms.\n\nAt this time, Waddington assumed that very little was known about the general characteristics of the epigenotype. However he argued, \u201cit consists of concatenations of processes linked together in a network, so that a disturbance at an early stage may gradually cause more and more far reaching abnormalities in many different organs and tissues\u201d (Waddington 1942, p. 10).\n\nMore than 10 years ago, the developmental biologists Eric Davidson and Michael Levine defined the \u2018gene regulatory networks\u2019 in a quite similar manner:\n\nGene regulatory networks explicitly represent the causality of developmental processes. They explain exactly how genomic sequence encodes the regulation of expression of the sets of genes that progressively generate developmental patterns and execute the construction of multiple states of differentiation. (Davidson and Levin 2005, p. 4935).\n\nIt should be noted that these definitions are quite different from contemporary definitions of epigenetics (for more on current definitions of epigenetics see Haig 2004; Felsenfeld 2014; Stotz and Griffiths 2016; Nicoglou and Merlin 2017).\n\nIn Waddington\u2019s 1942 paper, the epigenotype was used for the first time, not solely in reference to developmental processes but in a context where the genotype\u2013phenotype map was becoming understandable and relevant for more and more biologists (see Sinnott et al. 1950).\n\nTherefore, despite the fact that, today, there are recurrent references to Waddington 1942\u2019s paper in articles about epigenetics, at that time (in 1942 and for almost the next 60 years), the concept of epigenotype did not appear to have been a resounding success. It seems that Waddington\u2019s paper, as much as his concept of epigenotype started to be rediscovered in the 2000s. Indeed, the quotations of the paper reached a peak in 2015 (when it received 189 quotations, source: Google Scholar) before decreasing these last 3 years. However, that this paper was quoted does not imply that the concept of epigenotype was understood.\n\n3.3 Third encounter: the transformation of the epigenesist into an Epigeneticist\n\nAlmost 10 years later, in 1956, Waddington published The Principles of Embryology, a book in which he attempted to summarize his position concerning embryological mechanisms. At that time, he had been working for almost 12 years as the chief geneticist and deputy director of the National Animal Breeding and Genetics Research Organization (NABGRO) under the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) an organization, which was settled after the war upon the advise of American agriculturalists. The book was aimed at final-year students of embryology and genetics as much as researchers in other fields of biology (Robertson 1977). In this book, Waddington settled accounts with some of his predecessors and contemporaries concerning the state of the field (embryology) and particularly the misuse, in his opinion, of the phrase \u201cexperimental embryology\u201d or Entwicklungsmechanik as proposed by Roux.\n\nAnother rather awkward phrase, \u201cexperimental embryology\u201d, is often used in English in its place. Perhaps the most satisfactory expression would be \u201cepigenetics\u201d. This is derived from the Greek word epigenesis, which Aristotle used for the theory that development is brought about through a series of causal interactions between the various parts; it also reminds one that genetic factors are among the most important determinants of development. It is, however, not yet in common use. (Waddington 1956, p. 10).\n\nWaddington thought that the phrase \u201cEntwicklungsmechanik,\u201d just like that of \u201cexperimental embryology,\u201d was linked to the idea that only mechanical processes, similar to those produced by machines, were taken into account, while \u201cepigenesis\u201d described processes specific to development that Aristotle had first intended to depict (Goy 2018). But the phrase \u201cepigenetics\u201d was also a way for Waddington to highlight the fact that genetic factors were the most important determinant factors in development. It would also mean that genes, for Waddington, do not act in a purely mechanical manner. They do not produce effects as the usual mechanical machines do. Indeed, Waddington was aware that the interest concerning the activity of the genes was growing, not to say that it was becoming one of the main issues in biology. And most biologists started to wonder: \u201cHow does a given gene operate, what is the connection between a certain nucleo-protein constituent of a chromosome and some event in the cell containing it?\u201d (Waddington 1956, p. 19) But for Waddington, and at this point of his career, embryology could only help to understand how the different cells were generated even if it implied a certain activation of the genes:\n\nFor embryology the question should be turned upside down; not, how does a gene operate, but how is a developing tissue affected by the genotype of the cells? [\u2026] It is seldom, in these embryological investigations, that the genes enter explicitly into the picture, but we are dealing with the activation of different pathways of development, and these we know, on general grounds, to be ultimately under genetical control. It is, then, only a difference in the nature of the material being studied, and the techniques available, which distinguishes such work from genetical investigation into the way in which alterations in the cytoplasm or the presence or absence of certain substances in the external medium may stimulate or inhibit the operation of particular genes. (Waddington 1956, pp. 19\u201321, my emphasis).\n\nIn the 1956 book, the first two chapters, devoted to the fundamental mechanisms of development, dealt with \u201cthe role of the genes in the epigenetic system\u201d and \u201cthe activation of the genes by the cytoplasm.\u201d These issues were new from the embryological point of view but remained also quite underexamined from the genetical point of view. Therefore, Waddington used schematic representations to show how genetics was tightly connected with embryology in the explanation of the cellular phenotypes. Figure 6 is one of the first schematic representations of the epigenetic landscape that Waddington gave after the previous \u201cmetaphorical\u201d representation from his friend and painter John Piper.\n\nFig. 6 The epigenetic landscape. Waddington\u2019s first schematic representation of the developmental potentialities of the genotype. It first appeared in a 1954 paper before the 1956 book Full size image\n\nThis figure appears in a chapter devoted to the activation of the genes by the cytoplasm. However, while it was already more than 14 years after the first metaphorical representation Waddington had given of the epigenetic landscape, the connection between genetic and embryological data was not yet in common use (except maybe in Waddington\u2019s Institute). Furthermore, any representation of the epigenetic landscape, while used twice by Waddington (once in 1954 and once in 1956), had remained quite unnoticed by biologists and probably hardly fully understood. What were the two balls for? In the caption of the book, Waddington called them \u201cballs\u201d but they actually looked more like eggs. And this would introduce an uncertainty concerning what they were supposed to represent: two eggs? Two cells? None of them? In the first case, it could imply that the picture simulates the development of whole organisms; while in the second case it would represent the differentiation of cells. Another question might be: how can the balls roll down the rugged surface, which looks quite flat from top to bottom (the observer\u2019s point of view)? Or even, what did the two balls become at the end of their journey? Differentiated cells? Different types of cells? In the caption of the figure in the 1956 book, Waddington argued that they finished at a point where they became organs. However, it seems difficult to understand how a process of differentiation can lead from a single cell (or two cells) to some \u201ctypical organs\u201d, since organs may be composed of different kinds of cells, or cells that might have divided. Consequently, with this first representation of the epigenetic landscape appearing in a published book, the connection between the genes (or the genetic signals) and the developmental processes remained quite obscure and still highly metaphorical to the reader.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that in the paper of 1954, Waddington was clearer about his intentions concerning the picture (Fig. 6) and especially about the reasons why he provided such a picture. Indeed, the picture was supposed to be a response to Sewall Wright who had proposed in 1932 another picture, in three dimensions, to represent the concept of gene-ratio-frequencies and fitnesses of phenotypes in populations. Waddington thought that the exposition of such a concept required more dimensions and therefore offered his own picture (Fig. 6) of a \u201cdifferentiating system as a set of branching valleys, along the bottoms of which the developmental processes tend to run\u201d (Waddington 1954, p. 238). And he explained it the following way: \u201cwe can think of the various parts of the newly fertilised egg as a set of balls, each of which has a different bias corresponding to its particular local cytoplasmic conditions when development starts\u201d (Waddington 1954, p. 238).\n\nHe then related the picture to some of his ideas on evolutionary problems since he thought that the course of the valleys in the \u201cepigenetic landscape\u201d was not only determined by the genotype of the individual, but also by the environment under which development occurred. This aspect had been too much neglected for Waddington and specially by his colleagues like Wright. The result was \u201ca tendency for the relation between genes and natural selection to be envisaged too simply [and to an impoverishment of the] ideas about evolutionary processes\u201d (Waddington 1954, p. 139). In the paper, Waddington showed more clearly than in the book in which way the use of the \u201cepigenetic landscape\u201d representation as much as additional pictures was a kind of a weapon to battle the population geneticists\u2019 view of evolution, which was neglecting, in his opinion, both development and environmental conditions."}, {"url": "https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/59018", "page_content": "1.

Credit: Illustration by R. Craig Albertson\n\nYES, URGENTLY \u2014 Kevin Laland and colleagues\n\nNO, ALL IS WELL \u2014 Gregory A. Wray, Hopi E. Hoekstra and colleagues\n\nDoes evolutionary theory need a rethink? Yes, urgently\n\nWithout an extended evolutionary framework, the theory neglects key processes, say Kevin Laland and colleagues.\n\nCharles Darwin conceived of evolution by natural selection without knowing that genes exist. Now mainstream evolutionary theory has come to focus almost exclusively on genetic inheritance and processes that change gene frequencies.\n\nYet new data pouring out of adjacent fields are starting to undermine this narrow stance. An alternative vision of evolution is beginning to crystallize, in which the processes by which organisms grow and develop are recognized as causes of evolution.\n\nSome of us first met to discuss these advances six years ago. In the time since, as members of an interdisciplinary team, we have worked intensively to develop a broader framework, termed the extended evolutionary synthesis1 (EES), and to flesh out its structure, assumptions and predictions. In essence, this synthesis maintains that important drivers of evolution, ones that cannot be reduced to genes, must be woven into the very fabric of evolutionary theory.\n\nWe believe that the EES will shed new light on how evolution works. We hold that organisms are constructed in development, not simply \u2018programmed\u2019 to develop by genes. Living things do not evolve to fit into pre-existing environments, but co-construct and coevolve with their environments, in the process changing the structure of ecosystems.\n\nThe number of biologists calling for change in how evolution is conceptualized is growing rapidly. Strong support comes from allied disciplines, particularly developmental biology, but also genomics, epigenetics, ecology and social science1,2. We contend that evolutionary biology needs revision if it is to benefit fully from these other disciplines. The data supporting our position gets stronger every day.\n\nYet the mere mention of the EES often evokes an emotional, even hostile, reaction among evolutionary biologists. Too often, vital discussions descend into acrimony, with accusations of muddle or misrepresentation. Perhaps haunted by the spectre of intelligent design, evolutionary biologists wish to show a united front to those hostile to science. Some might fear that they will receive less funding and recognition if outsiders \u2014 such as physiologists or developmental biologists \u2014 flood into their field.\n\nHowever, another factor is more important: many conventional evolutionary biologists study the processes that we claim are neglected, but they comprehend them very differently (see \u2018No, all is well\u2019). This is no storm in an academic tearoom, it is a struggle for the very soul of the discipline.\n\nHere we articulate the logic of the EES in the hope of taking some heat out of this debate and encouraging open discussion of the fundamental causes of evolutionary change (see Supplementary Information).\n\nCore values\n\nThe core of current evolutionary theory was forged in the 1930s and 1940s. It combined natural selection, genetics and other fields into a consensus about how evolution occurs. This \u2018modern synthesis\u2019 allowed the evolutionary process to be described mathematically as frequencies of genetic variants in a population change over time \u2014 as, for instance, in the spread of genetic resistance to the myxoma virus in rabbits.\n\nIn the decades since, evolutionary biology has incorporated developments consistent with the tenets of the modern synthesis. One such is \u2018neutral theory\u2019, which emphasizes random events in evolution. However, standard evolutionary theory (SET) largely retains the same assumptions as the original modern synthesis, which continues to channel how people think about evolution.\n\nPlasticity: commodore butterflies emerge with different colours in dry (left) and wet seasons. Credit: Orange: Peter Chadwick/SPL; Blue: Lawrence Lawry/SPL\n\nThe story that SET tells is simple: new variation arises through random genetic mutation; inheritance occurs through DNA; and natural selection is the sole cause of adaptation, the process by which organisms become well-suited to their environments. In this view, the complexity of biological development \u2014 the changes that occur as an organism grows and ages \u2014 are of secondary, even minor, importance.\n\nIn our view, this \u2018gene-centric\u2019 focus fails to capture the full gamut of processes that direct evolution. Missing pieces include how physical development influences the generation of variation (developmental bias); how the environment directly shapes organisms\u2019 traits (plasticity); how organisms modify environments (niche construction); and how organisms transmit more than genes across generations (extra-genetic inheritance). For SET, these phenomena are just outcomes of evolution. For the EES, they are also causes.\n\nValuable insight into the causes of adaptation and the appearance of new traits comes from the field of evolutionary developmental biology (\u2018evo-devo\u2019). Some of its experimental findings are proving tricky to assimilate into SET. Particularly thorny is the observation that much variation is not random because developmental processes generate certain forms more readily than others3. For example, among one group of centipedes, each of the more than 1,000 species has an odd number of leg-bearing segments, because of the mechanisms of segment development3.\n\nIn our view, this concept \u2014 developmental bias \u2014 helps to explain how organisms adapt to their environments and diversify into many different species. For example, cichlid fishes in Lake Malawi are more closely related to other cichlids in Lake Malawi than to those in Lake Tanganyika, but species in both lakes have strikingly similar body shapes4. In each case, some fish have large fleshy lips, others protruding foreheads, and still others short, robust lower jaws.\n\nSET explains such parallels as convergent evolution: similar environmental conditions select for random genetic variation with equivalent results. This account requires extraordinary coincidence to explain the multiple parallel forms that evolved independently in each lake. A more succinct hypothesis is that developmental bias and natural selection work together4,5. Rather than selection being free to traverse across any physical possibility, it is guided along specific routes opened up by the processes of development5,6.\n\nThere is more to inheritance than genes.\n\nAnother kind of developmental bias occurs when individuals respond to their environment by changing their form \u2014 a phenomenon called plasticity. For instance, leaf shape changes with soil water and chemistry. SET views this plasticity as merely fine-tuning, or even noise. The EES sees it as a plausible first step in adaptive evolution. The key finding here is that plasticity not only allows organisms to cope in new environmental conditions but to generate traits that are well-suited to them. If selection preserves genetic variants that respond effectively when conditions change, then adaptation largely occurs by accumulation of genetic variations that stabilize a trait after its first appearance5,6. In other words, often it is the trait that comes first; genes that cement it follow, sometimes several generations later5.\n\nStudies of fish, birds, amphibians and insects suggest that adaptations that were, initially, environmentally induced may promote colonization of new environments and facilitate speciation5,6. Some of the best-studied examples of this are in fishes, such as sticklebacks and Arctic char. Differences in the diets and conditions of fish living at the bottom and in open water have induced distinct body forms, which seem to be evolving reproductive isolation, a stage in forming new species. The number of species in a lineage does not depend solely on how random genetic variation is winnowed through different environmental sieves. It also hangs on developmental properties that contribute to the lineage\u2019s \u2018evolvability\u2019.\n\nIn essence, SET treats the environment as a \u2018background condition\u2019, which may trigger or modify selection, but is not itself part of the evolutionary process. It does not differentiate between how termites become adapted to mounds that they construct and, say, how organisms adapt to volcanic eruptions. We view these cases as fundamentally different7.\n\nVolcanic eruptions are idiosyncratic events, independent of organisms\u2019 actions. By contrast, termites construct and regulate their homes in a repeatable, directional manner that is shaped by past selection and that instigates future selection. Similarly, mammals, birds and insects defend, maintain and improve their nests \u2014 adaptive responses to nest building that have evolved again and again7. This \u2018niche construction\u2019, like developmental bias, means that organisms co-direct their own evolution by systematically changing environments and thereby biasing selection7.\n\nInheritance beyond genes\n\nSET has long regarded inheritance mechanisms outside genes as special cases; human culture being the prime example. The EES explicitly recognizes that parent\u2013offspring similarities result in part from parents reconstructing their own developmental environments for their offspring. \u2018Extra-genetic inheritance\u2019 includes the transmission of epigenetic marks (chemical changes that alter DNA expression but not the underlying sequence) that influence fertility, longevity and disease resistance across taxa8. In addition, extra-genetic inheritance includes socially transmitted behaviour in animals, such as nut cracking in chimpanzees or the migratory patterns of reef fishes8,9. It also encompasses those structures and altered conditions that organisms leave to their descendants through their niche construction \u2014 from beavers\u2019 dams to worm-processed soils7,10. Research over the past decade has established such inheritance to be so widespread that it should be part of general theory.\n\nMathematical models of evolutionary dynamics that incorporate extra-genetic inheritance make different predictions from those that do not7,8,9. Inclusive models help to explain a wide range of puzzling phenomena, such as the rapid colonization of North America by the house finch, the adaptive potential of invasive plants with low genetic diversity, and how reproductive isolation is established.\n\nSuch legacies can even generate macro-evolutionary patterns. For instance, evidence suggests that sponges oxygenated the ocean and by doing so created opportunities for other organisms to live on the seabed10. Accumulating fossil data indicate that inherited modifications of the environment by species has repeatedly facilitated, sometimes after millions of years, the evolution of new species and ecosystems10.\n\nBetter together\n\nThe above insights derive from different fields, but fit together with surprising coherence. They show that variation is not random, that there is more to inheritance than genes, and that there are multiple routes to the fit between organisms and environments. Importantly, they demonstrate that development is a direct cause of why and how adaptation and speciation occur, and of the rates and patterns of evolutionary change.\n\nSET consistently frames these phenomena in a way that undermines their significance. For instance, developmental bias is generally taken to impose \u2018constraints\u2019 on what selection can achieve \u2014 a hindrance that explains only the absence of adaptation. By contrast, the EES recognizes developmental processes as a creative element, demarcating which forms and features evolve, and hence accounting for why organisms possess the characters that they do.\n\nResearchers in fields from physiology and ecology to anthropology are running up against the limiting assumptions of the standard evolutionary framework without realizing that others are doing the same. We believe that a plurality of perspectives in science encourages development of alternative hypotheses, and stimulates empirical work. No longer a protest movement, the EES is now a credible framework inspiring useful work by bringing diverse researchers under one theoretical roof to effect conceptual change in evolutionary biology.\n\n*******\n\nDoes evolutionary theory need a rethink? No, all is well\n\nTheory accommodates evidence through relentless synthesis, say Gregory A. Wray, Hopi E. Hoekstra and colleagues.\n\nIn October 1881, just six months before he died, Charles Darwin published his final book. The Formation of Vegetable Mould, Through the Actions of Worms11 sold briskly: Darwin\u2019s earlier publications had secured his reputation. He devoted an entire book to these humble creatures in part because they exemplify an interesting feedback process: earthworms are adapted to thrive in an environment that they modify through their own activities.\n\nDarwin learned about earthworms from conversations with gardeners and his own simple experiments. He had a genius for distilling penetrating insights about evolutionary processes \u2014 often after amassing years of observational and experimental data \u2014 and he drew on such disparate topics as agriculture, geology, embryology and behaviour. Evolutionary thinking ever since has followed Darwin\u2019s lead in its emphasis on evidence and in synthesizing information from other fields.\n\nA profound shift in evolutionary thinking began during the 1920s, when a handful of statisticians and geneticists began quietly laying the foundations for a dramatic transformation. Their work between 1936 and 1947 culminated in the \u2018modern synthesis\u2019, which united Darwin\u2019s concept of natural selection with the nascent field of genetics and, to a lesser extent, palaeontology and systematics. Most importantly, it laid the theoretical foundations for a quantitative and rigorous understanding of adaptation and speciation, two of the most fundamental evolutionary processes.\n\nA worm cast pictured in Charles Darwin\u2019s final book. Credit: John van Wyhe/Darwin-online.org.uk\n\nIn the decades since, generations of evolutionary biologists have modified, corrected and extended the framework of the modern synthesis in countless ways. Like Darwin, they have drawn heavily from other fields. When molecular biologists identified DNA as the material basis for heredity and trait variation, for instance, their discoveries catalysed fundamental extensions to evolutionary theory. For example, the realization that many genetic changes have no fitness consequences led to major theoretical advances in population genetics. The discovery of \u2018selfish\u2019 DNA prompted discussions about selection at the level of genes rather than traits. Kin selection theory, which describes how traits affecting relatives are selected, represents another extension12.\n\nNonetheless there are evolutionary biologists (see \u2018Yes, urgently\u2019) who argue that theory has since ossified around genetic concepts. More specifically, they contend that four phenomena are important evolutionary processes: phenotypic plasticity, niche construction, inclusive inheritance and developmental bias. We could not agree more. We study them ourselves.\n\nBut we do not think that these processes deserve such special attention as to merit a new name such as \u2018extended evolutionary synthesis\u2019. Below we outline three reasons why we believe that these topics already receive their due in current evolutionary theory.\n\nNew words, old concepts\n\nThe evolutionary phenomena championed by Laland and colleagues are already well integrated into evolutionary biology, where they have long provided useful insights. Indeed, all of these concepts date back to Darwin himself, as exemplified by his analysis of the feedback that occurred as earthworms became adapted to their life in soil.\n\nToday we call such a process niche construction, but the new name does not alter the fact that evolutionary biologists have been studying feedback between organisms and the environment for well over a century13. Stunning adaptations such as termite mounds, beaver dams, and bowerbird displays have long been a staple of evolutionary studies. No less spectacular are cases that can only be appreciated at the microscopic or molecular scale, such as viruses that hijack host cells to reproduce and \u2018quorum sensing\u2019, a sort of group think by bacteria.\n\nAnother process, phenotypic plasticity, has drawn considerable attention from evolutionary biologists. Countless cases in which the environment influences trait variation have been documented \u2014 from the jaws of cichlid fishes that change shape when food sources alter, to leaf-mimicking insects that are brown if born in the dry season and green in the wet. Technological advances in the past decade have revealed an incredible degree of plasticity in gene expression in response to diverse environmental conditions, opening the door to understanding its material basis. Much discussed, too, was a book5 by behavioural scientist Mary Jane West-Eberhard that explored how plasticity might precede genetic changes during adaptation.\n\nSo, none of the phenomena championed by Laland and colleagues are neglected in evolutionary biology. Like all ideas, however, they need to prove their value in the marketplace of rigorous theory, empirical results and critical discussion. The prominence that these four phenomena command in the discourse of contemporary evolutionary theory reflects their proven explanatory power, not a lack of attention.\n\nModern expansion\n\nFurthermore, the phenomena that interest Laland and colleagues are just four among many that offer promise for future advances in evolutionary biology. Most evolutionary biologists have a list of topics that they would like to see given more attention. Some would argue that epistasis \u2014 complex interactions among genetic variants \u2014 has long been under-appreciated. Others would advocate for cryptic genetic variation (mutations that affect only traits under specific genetic or environmental conditions). Still others would stress the importance of extinction, or adaptation to climate change, or the evolution of behaviour. The list goes on.\n\nWe could stop and argue about whether \u2018enough\u2019 attention is being paid to any of these. Or we could roll up our sleeves, get to work, and find out by laying the theoretical foundations and building a solid casebook of empirical studies. Advocacy can take an idea only so far.\n\nWhat Laland and colleagues term the standard evolutionary theory is a caricature that views the field as static and monolithic. They see today\u2019s evolutionary biologists as unwilling to consider ideas that challenge convention.\n\nWe see a very different world. We consider ourselves fortunate to live and work in the most exciting, inclusive and progressive period of evolutionary research since the modern synthesis. Far from being stuck in the past, current evolutionary theory is vibrantly creative and rapidly growing in scope. Evolutionary biologists today draw inspiration from fields as diverse as genomics, medicine, ecology, artificial intelligence and robotics. We think Darwin would approve.\n\nGenes are central\n\nFinally, diluting what Laland and colleagues deride as a \u2018gene-centric\u2019 view would de-emphasize the most powerfully predictive, broadly applicable and empirically validated component of evolutionary theory. Changes in the hereditary material are an essential part of adaptation and speciation. The precise genetic basis for countless adaptations has been documented in detail, ranging from antibiotic resistance in bacteria to camouflage coloration in deer mice, to lactose tolerance in humans.\n\nAlthough genetic changes are required for adaptation, non-genetic processes can sometimes play a part in how organisms evolve. Laland and colleagues are correct that phenotypic plasticity, for instance, may contribute to the adaptedness of an individual. A seedling might bend towards brighter light, growing into a tree with a different shape from its siblings\u2019. Many studies have shown that this kind of plasticity is beneficial, and that it can readily evolve if there is genetic variation in the response14. This role for plasticity in evolutionary change is so well documented that there is no need for special advocacy.\n\nWhat matters is the heritable differences in traits, especially those that bestow some selective advantage.\n\nMuch less clear is whether plasticity can \u2018lead\u2019 genetic variation during adaptation. More than half a century ago, developmental biologist Conrad Waddington described a process that he called genetic assimilation15. Here, new mutations can sometimes convert a plastic trait into one that develops even without the specific environmental condition that originally induced it. Few cases have been documented outside of the laboratory, however. Whether this is owing to a lack of serious attention or whether it reflects a genuine rarity in nature can be answered only by further study.\n\nLack of evidence also makes it difficult to evaluate the role that developmental bias may have in the evolution (or lack of evolution) of adaptive traits. Developmental processes, based on features of the genome that may be specific to a particular group of organisms, certainly can influence the range of traits that natural selection can act on. However, what matters ultimately is not the extent of trait variation, nor even its precise mechanistic causes. What matters is the heritable differences in traits, especially those that bestow some selective advantage. Likewise, there is little evidence for the role of inherited epigenetic modification (part of what was termed \u2018inclusive inheritance\u2019) in adaptation: we know of no case in which a new trait has been shown to have a strictly epigenetic basis divorced from gene sequence. On both topics, further research will be valuable.\n\nAll four phenomena that Laland and colleagues promote are \u2018add-ons\u2019 to the basic processes that produce evolutionary change: natural selection, drift, mutation, recombination and gene flow. None of these additions is essential for evolution, but they can alter the process under certain circumstances. For this reason they are eminently worthy of study.\n\nWe invite Laland and colleagues to join us in a more expansive extension, rather than imagining divisions that do not exist. We appreciate their ideas as an important part of what evolutionary theory might become in the future. We, too, want an extended evolutionary synthesis, but for us, these words are lowercase because this is how our field has always advanced16.\n\nThe best way to elevate the prominence of genuinely interesting phenomena such as phenotypic plasticity, inclusive inheritance, niche construction and developmental bias (and many, many others) is to strengthen the evidence for their importance."}, {"url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10780-021-09433-5", "page_content": "In The Ethical Animal, Waddington places the notion of \u201cbiological wisdom\u201d into the context of seeing phenomena, beliefs, and actions \u201cin the light of their bearing on general evolution\u201d (Waddington, 1960, p. 204) in evaluating their character. He writes that \u201cobservation of the world of living things reveals a general evolutionary direction, which has a philosophical status similar to that of healthy growth\u201d and that \u201cany particular set of ethical beliefs, which some individual [person] may advance, can be meaningfully judged according to their efficacy in furthering this general evolutionary direction\u201d (Waddington, 1960, p. 7). Elsewhere, in The Nature of Life, he states that.\n\nany understanding that we can attain of the general pattern of human cultural evolution provides us with a criterion of what one might call \u201cwisdom,\u201d which can be applied to judge whether one type of ethical belief is to be [selectively] preferred [over] another (Waddington, 1961, p. 113, my addition).\n\nWaddington\u2019s notion of \u201cbiological wisdom\u201d involves the idea that human beings should seek to maintain, promote, and sustainably enhance the general well-being of the natural world, and most importantly, the living organisms which are a part of it, and help to compose it. It is evident that there are diverse aspects of organismic well-being: e.g., physiological (including bodily, genetic, epigenetic, and reproductive health), mental, emotional, relational, spiritual, autonomy (i.e., the ability to choose what to submit oneself to), ecological, each of which is best represented by one or more of the major ethical theories in the history of western philosophy, e.g., Virtue Ethics, Christian Ethics, Contractarianism, Utilitarianism, Kantian Deontology, Situational Deontology, Feminist Ethics, and Existentialism, although each one of these aspects can, situationally, override the others in terms of importance. Yet, in general, we know enough, objectively-speaking and prima facie, about what contributes to, and constitutes, ecological health and organismic well-being, and what does not, to know what we ought not to do to living organisms (i.e., thwart their well-being, for example, by unreflectively disposing vast quantities human waste in the midst of the habitats of large populations of non-human creatures). In this light, Waddington stresses that the basic criterion of biological wisdom, namely, of promoting well-being or \u201chealthy growth\u201d involves a reference to a \u201ccomplex states of affairs,\u201d but it is still something objective, i.e., \u201cimmanent in nature as we find it, not superimposed on it from outside\u201d (Waddington, 1960, p. 30).\n\nElsewhere, in The Man-Made Future, Waddington further defines that \u201cbiological wisdom\u201d involves the cultivation of an orientation of ourselves beyond what is merely \u201cgood for\u201d or \u201cadvantageous\u201d to ourselves as biological creatures in the fleeting present, as for example, in procuring for oneself, at least momentarily, \u201cadequate food and health, and the ability to grow up successfully and leave offspring to contribute to the next generation\u201d (Waddington, 1978, p. 305) and/or maximizing our own power over the environment and over other living creatures. Referring to what really constitutes adaptive \u201csuccess\u201d on the part of organisms in dealing with the exigencies of their environment, Waddington writes that to be truly.\n\nefficient in the face of natural selection requires not only that the animal be adapted to a particular mode of life in the ecological system in which it lives, but if a lineage of animals is to continue evolving for a long period [i.e., \u201csustainably\u201d] it must be adapted in a way which is flexible enough to allow for modification when the ecosystem changes, as it inevitably will (Waddington, 1978, p. 305).\n\nAnalogously, for Waddington, part of the meaning of the term \u201cbiological wisdom\u201d involves the notion that organisms meet \u201cthe immediate demands of today\u2019s ecology and flexibility sufficient to cope with the unforeseen demands that tomorrow may bring\u201d (Waddington, 1978, p. 306). From these considerations, it may be concluded that Waddingtonian \u201cbiological wisdom\u201d can be quite readily associated with homeostasis researcher, Walter B. Cannon\u2019s (1871\u20131945) emphasis on cultivating \u201cthe wisdom of the body\u201dFootnote 18 as well as Deep Ecologist, Arne Naess\u2019 (1912\u20132002) emphasis on cultivating \u201cecological wisdom\u201d (ecosophia),Footnote 19 and it may also designate a general overlapping of these notions. In this respect, the cultivation of \u201cbiological wisdom\u201d can be said to involve: (1) the interpretation of various modes of human thinking, activity, and endeavor through the lenses of evolutionary biology and ecology; (2) the gaining of a greater understanding of the health, evolutionary, and ecological impacts of our assumptions about the natural world and of our actions, not only on ourselves, but on fellow human beings, on future generations, and on the evolutionary trajectories of other organisms; (3) a critical reflection on these impacts; (4) a selection from among alternative hypothetical courses of action that may better promote the general good and well-being of the biosphere; and (5) the habitual engagement in such reflection and selection in order to guide ourselves in terms of ethical praxis.\n\nWaddington\u2019s emphasis on \u201cbiological wisdom\u201d coincides with the main thesis that he defends in The Ethical Animal, which relates to education construed as humankind\u2019s \u201csocio-genetic\u201d inheritance system. He thought that it was important \u201cto consider carefully the requirements for any process which will make it possible for information to be transmitted from one generation to the next by teaching and learning\u201d finding that\u201d for such a process to be effective, it is not only necessary for a language to be developed in which the information can be expressed, but,\u201d as a valuative-selective-appropriative agent unto him- or herself, \u201cit is essential that the recipient [has] a frame of mind in which he [or she] is prepared to receive the information that is transmitted to him\u201d (Waddington, 1961, p. 111). Waddington felt that Huxley had overlooked the fact that, to some degree, at least a rudimentary sense of what is ethically valuable as well as moral conduct in general in the context of the educational relationship between teacher and learner, are pre-requisites for having this \u201cframe of mind,\u201d such that the ethical sense is part of the very foundation of the \u201cpsycho-social\u201d or \u201csocio-genetic\u201d inheritance system, which, in the evolutionary past at least, necessitated person-to-person contact. The necessary habitualization of, or predisposition for, ethical conduct in education is exemplified by the fact that, on the one hand, in the context of the teacher-learner relationship, a level of honesty, responsibility, care, and compassion, among other virtues, can be said to be required on the part of the transmitter, parent, elder, or teacher in relation to their professing of that knowledge to the learner or receiver as being accurate or true. Additionally, an authentic intention to promote the learner or receiver\u2019s well-being, rather than either to harm them or be indifferent toward them, is necessary (see Waddington, 1961, p. 151\u2013154, 164\u2013165, 175\u2013176). On the other hand, the learner or receiver requires a level of belief and trust in the authority of the parent\u2019s, elder\u2019s or teacher\u2019s knowledge (and/or has conscientiously internalized such an authority), which undoubtedly is largely dependent on the latter\u2019s moral character, as well as the discipline and responsibility to follow through with the requirements of the learning or research process. As Waddington suggests, \u201csocio-genetic transmission requires that first of all the recipient believes what he is told\u201d and \u201conly after that\u201d do we talk about an individual \u201ccomparing [the received information] with empirical observation, or with other items of information, and accepting or rejecting it\u201d (Waddington, 1961, p. 111), selectively. For Waddington, it is not that the learner or receiver must merely submit to authority of a teacher or information-transmitter, in the sense the latter should have complete power or control over the pupil, but rather that what is part of the foundation of teacher\u2013pupil relationships from which authentic learning and socio-genetic inheritance can take place is a sense for what is ethically valuable, namely, what is \u201cauthoritative in the sense of tending to impose an obligation\u201d (Waddington, 1961, p. 112) on one person in relation to another. As such, for Waddington, ethical character is a pre-requisite for \u201cmaking it possible for [one] to transmit information by teaching and learning\u201d and it is part of the very foundation of \u201cour special human or socio-genetic type of cultural heredity\u201d (Waddington, 1961, p. 113). Waddington admits that the invention of writing, as well as recent technology such as audio- and video-recording has, to some extent, removed the necessity of person-to-person contact in transmitting information. However, similar ethical notions, such as belief and trust on the part of the receiver in the author\u2019s writings or recordings, and honesty and responsibility on the part of the writer or recorder for the quality of the information that is transmitted, can still be said to be in play.\n\nThe obvious implication here in Waddington\u2019s discourse is that Huxley\u2019s vision of education being made into an instrumental function of eugenics programs that are geared toward persuading, mechanistically, from without, the \u201cungifted\u201d learner (in Huxley\u2019s terminology), for example, not to reproduce themselves, or to accept the risks of taking on transhumanist interventions implemented by bio-engineers outside of them, is not authentically in the learner\u2019s own biological interests. It is treating them instrumentally, namely, as machines there to perform a function for the educator. It is not authentically treating them organismically, especially by respecting them as having intrinsic worth, a notion that is grounded in the facts of their intrinsic purposiveness (as demonstrable by the homeostatic, chronobiological, and autopoietic processes through which they persist in the face of entropy) and their valuative-selective agency as living beings. Waddington admits that understanding the evolutionary process unavoidably involves an awareness of the role of elimination and death therein. But, for him, this does not mean that this should enable one to commit the \u201cis/ought\u201d or \u201cnaturalistic\u201d fallacy in one\u2019s ethical and ideological outlooks so as to emphasize that society should actively bring about the elimination of, or the transhumanistic alteration of, human beings, no matter how subtle or \u201ccompassionate\u201d the means may appear to be. As those learners who are deemed to be \u201cungifted\u201d by Huxley gradually find out through critical reflection and from other sources of information that: (1) they are being instrumentally provided with and/or steered toward the \u201cintegrative chreodes\u201d that they are said \u201cto require\u201d (as Huxley emphasizes) rather than being authentically assisted, as agents, by teachers in terms of their own courses of self-development or processes of intellectual autopoiesis; and/or (2) they are ultimately being used as means only to the ends of eugenics (i.e., their \u201ceu-selective\u201d elimination and demise); and/or (3) they are being characterized as the \u201cungifted\u201d in the process of being convinced by their teachers to take on all the tremendous risks of transhumanist genetic enhancement for the sake of entering into the class of \u201cgifted\u201d individuals; and/or (4) they are, in general, not being treated them as intrinsically purposive, self-creating (i.e., autopoietic) agents, having intrinsic worth, eventually they would cease to trust or believe the teacher or the information transmitter, thereby undermining the sustainability of the very \u201cpsycho-social\u201d or \u201csocio-genetic\u201d inheritance system that Huxley otherwise deems to be so valuable to humanity. Formal education requires selectivity in the biological sense (e.g., the selection of curricula by educators potentially in conjunction with learners; the selectivity underpinning the learner\u2019s developing critical consciousness; and even, as Whitehead observed, the selection of student work in terms of grades and students in general in terms of their range of opportunities for advancement in society based on the quality of their school-workFootnote 20), but the point is to cultivate biological wisdom by critically reflecting on such selectivity. That said, education that is selectively focused a priori on pitching those it deems to be \u201cgifted\u201d against those it deems to be \u201cungifted,\u201d as Huxley seems to promote, propagates increased conflict among persons and classes in society. Accordingly, for Waddington, an important aspect of education \u201cis our treatment of the developing child\u201d citing that.\n\nit seems probable that to a considerable extent their healthy development is conditioned by the extent to which one is treated by the other people with whom one comes into contact as a person\u2014an individual\u2014rather than as a representative of some abstract conception such as a racial or class group (Waddington, 1960, p. 205).\n\nHence, by extension, the chief thesis that Waddington is asserting subtly against Huxley in the last chapter of The Ethical Animal, entitled \u201cBiological Wisdom and the Problems of Today,\u201d is that formal education that is made into a function of eugenics programs, or of evolutionary humanist, and/or transhumanist ideology, undermines a foundational pillar of education as a whole, namely, authentically ethical conduct and it potentially leads to the unsustainability and breakdown of the teacher-learner relationship, including humanity\u2019s \u201csocio-genetic\u201d or \u201cpsycho-social\u201d inheritance system as a whole. Instead of undermining this vital epigenetic inheritance system and/or rendering it unsustainable, a system that has afforded humanity with tremendous capacities and potentialities over eons of evolutionary time\u2014learners simply ceasing to believe in the trustworthiness of teachers and in formal education as a whole\u2014Waddington\u2019s thesis is that in reference to the topic of education, an emphasis on the cultivation of \u201cbiological wisdom\u201d will strengthen, rather than diminish, the foundations of the socio-genetic evolutionary system. It will, as he says, \u201cencourage the forward progress\u201d and sustainability both of \u201cthe socio-genetic evolutionary system, and of the changes in the grade of human organization which that system brings about\u201d (Waddington, 1960, p. 241). As such, he is here tacitly making the critical judgments that (1) Huxley\u2019s cooptation of education by way of evolutionary humanist ideology, eugenics, and transhumanism undermines this \u201csocio-genetic\u201d inheritance system, and that (2) Huxley\u2019s overall standpoint is \u201cbiologically unwise.\u201d From a Waddingtonian perspective, it is \u201cbiologically unwise\u201d not to respect students as appropriative-valuative-selective agents in the educational and evolutionary processes, having intrinsic worth, and instead to treat them merely as passive objects upon which teachers must act (e.g., as in the \u201cbanking model of education\u201d that is described and criticized by Paulo Freire) in advancing the narrow eliminative and hubristic goals of their evolutionary humanist ideology. This notion gives deeper biological meaning to the Whiteheadian idea that education entails the teacher-assisted self-development of the learner. The notion that students are appropriative-valuative-selective agents in relation to their own learning, having intrinsic worth, affecting teachers and the modes of instruction, and, for example, being given the opportunity to participate to some extent in the selection of curricula so that they can exert some degree of autonomy in relation to their learning and development, and to experience, in a safe educational setting, what the consequences might be, reflects, in an imperfect analogy, the Waddingtonian point that epigenetic processes reciprocally affect genes (in contrast to the traditional neo-Darwinian view that they cannot) and participate in the channeling out of the course of the organism\u2019s biological development. Moreover, Waddington\u2019s thesis here may be tantamount to the defense of an evolutionary ethic which emphasizes, sustainably, the promotion of human life and human well-being, beyond the confines of anthropocentric humanism and biocentric anti-humanism."}, {"url": "https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/218/6/816/14495/Conrad-Waddington-and-the-origin-of-epigenetics", "page_content": "In 1956, the British developmental biologist, Conrad Waddington, published a paper in the journal Evolution (Waddington, 1956) in which he succeeded in demonstrating the inheritance of a characteristic acquired in a population in response to an environmental stimulus. Much earlier, in 1890, August Weismann had tried and failed to achieve this. He amputated the tails of five successive generations of mice and showed absolutely no evidence for an effect on subsequent generations. Weismann's discovery that the effects of an environmental stimulus (tail amputation) cannot be transmitted to subsequent generations, together with his assumption that genetic change is random, formed the foundations of the Modern Synthesis (Neo-Darwinism) of our understanding of genetic inheritance.\n\nWaddington's approach, however, was much more subtle and more likely to be successful because he realised that the way to test for the inheritance of acquired characteristics is first to discover what forms of developmental plasticity already exist in a population, or that the population could be persuaded to demonstrate with a little nudging from the environment. By exploiting plasticity that already existed he was much more likely to mimic a path that evolution itself could have taken.\n\nHe used the word \u2018canalised\u2019 for this kind of persuasion since he represented the developmental process as a series of \u2018decisions\u2019 that could be represented as \u2018valleys\u2019 and \u2018forks\u2019 in a developmental landscape (Fig. 1). He knew from his developmental studies that embryo fruit flies could be persuaded to show different thorax and wing structures, simply by changing the environmental temperature or by a chemical stimulus. In his landscape diagram, this could be represented as a small manipulation in slope that would lead to one channel in the landscape being favoured over another, so that the adult could show a different phenotype starting from the same genotype.\n\nFig. 1. View largeDownload slide Waddington's developmental landscape diagram. The landscape itself and the ball at the top are from his original diagram. The subsequent positions of the ball have been added to illustrate his point that development can be canalised to follow different routes (A and B). The plasticity to enable this to happen already exists in the wild population of organisms (modified diagram by K. Mitchell). Fig. 1. View largeDownload slide Waddington's developmental landscape diagram. The landscape itself and the ball at the top are from his original diagram. The subsequent positions of the ball have been added to illustrate his point that development can be canalised to follow different routes (A and B). The plasticity to enable this to happen already exists in the wild population of organisms (modified diagram by K. Mitchell).\n\nThe next step in his experiment was to select for and breed from the animals that displayed the new characteristic. Exposed to the same environmental stimulus, these gave rise to progeny with an even higher proportion of adults displaying the new character. After a relatively small number of generations, he found that he could then breed from the animals and obtain robust inheritance of the new character even without applying the environmental stimulus. The characteristic had therefore become locked into the genetics of the animal. He called this process genetic assimilation. What he had succeeded in showing was that an acquired characteristic could first be inherited as what we would now call \u2018soft\u2019 inheritance, and that it could then be assimilated into becoming standard \u2018hard\u2019 genetic inheritance. Today, we call \u2018soft\u2019 inheritance epigenetic inheritance, and of course, we know many more mechanisms by which the same genome can be controlled to produce different epigenetic effects.\n\nWhat was happening at the gene level in Waddington's experiments? A standard Neo-Darwinist explanation might be that some mutations occurred. That is possible, but extremely unlikely on the time scale of the experiment, which was only a few generations. Moreover, random mutations would occur in individuals, not in a whole group. Single small mutations would have taken very many generations to spread through whole populations, and many such mutations would have been required.\n\nBut I think there is a much simpler explanation. Recall that the experiment exploited plasticity that is already present in the population. That strongly suggests that all the alleles (gene variants) necessary for the inheritance of the characteristic were already present in the population, but not initially in any particular individuals in the correct combination. The experiment simply brings them together. This is a modification of the pattern of the genome in response to the environmental change, but not in a way that requires any new mutations. I came to this conclusion before reading Waddington's (1957) book, The Strategy of the Genes. But it is in fact one of Waddington's own ideas! He writes \u2018There is no \u2026 reason which would prevent us from imagining that all the genes which eventually make up the assimilated genotype were already present in the population before the selection began, and only required bringing together\u2019 (p. 176). Not only does he clearly see this possibility, he also tests it. He continues (p. 178) \u2018Attempts to carry out genetic assimilation starting from inbred lines have remained quite unsuccessful. This provides further evidence that the process depends on the utilisation of genetic variability in the foundation stock with which the experiment begins\u2019. His text could not be clearer.\n\nOrthodox Neo-Darwinists dismissed Waddington's findings as merely an example of the evolution of phenotype plasticity. That is what you will find in many of the biology textbooks even today (e.g. Arthur, 2010). I think that Waddington showed more than that. Of course, plasticity can evolve, and that itself could be by a Neo-Darwinist or any other mechanism. But Waddington was not simply showing the evolution of plasticity in general; he was showing how it could be exploited to enable a particular acquired characteristic in response to an environmental change to be inherited and be assimilated into the genome. Moreover, he departed from the strict Neo-Darwinist view by showing that this could happen even if no new mutations occur (Fig. 2).\n\nFig. 2. View largeDownload slide Waddington's diagram to show how the developmental landscape relates to individual genes (bottom pegs) through networks of interactions in the organism. Since he also showed the influence of the external environment on canalisation of development, I have extended the diagram by adding the top part to represent the environmental influences. It is the combination of these influences that can lead to an evolutionary change without mutations (modified from Waddington, 1957). Fig. 2. View largeDownload slide Waddington's diagram to show how the developmental landscape relates to individual genes (bottom pegs) through networks of interactions in the organism. Since he also showed the influence of the external environment on canalisation of development, I have extended the diagram by adding the top part to represent the environmental influences. It is the combination of these influences that can lead to an evolutionary change without mutations (modified from Waddington, 1957).\n\nEpigenetics means \u2018above genetics\u2019 and it was originally conceived by Waddington himself to describe the existence of mechanisms of inheritance in addition to (over and above) standard genetics (Bard, 2008). Waddington regarded himself as a Darwinist since Darwin also, in The Origin of Species, included the inheritance of acquired characteristics. But significantly, Waddington was not a Neo-Darwinist since Neo-Darwinism, following Weismann, specifically excludes such inheritance. Waddington was a profound thinker about biology, and much else too. The Strategy of the Genes is a masterly account of the many reasons why he dissented from Neo-Darwinism, and it has stood the test of time. It was reprinted over half a century later, in 2014. He did not describe himself as a Lamarckian, but by revealing mechanisms of inheritance of acquired characteristics, I think he should be regarded as such. The reason he did not do so is that Lamarck could not have conceived of the processes that Waddington revealed. Incidentally, it is also true to say that Lamarck did not invent the idea of the inheritance of acquired characteristics. But, whether historically correct or not, we are stuck today with the term \u2018Lamarckian\u2019 for inheritance of a characteristic acquired through an environmental influence.\n\nWaddington's concepts of plasticity and epigenetics have been very influential in my own thinking about experiments on cardiac rhythm. We found that the heart's pacemaker is very robust, so much so that protein mechanisms normally responsible for a large part of the rhythm could be completely blocked or deleted (Noble et al., 1992). Only very small changes in rhythm occur, because other mechanisms come into play to ensure that pacemaker activity continues. The relation between individual genes and the phenotype is therefore mediated through networks of interactions that can buffer individual gene variation, just as Waddington envisaged in his diagrams of epigenetic effects and canalisation. This is one of the reasons why I became interested in evolutionary biology many years ago, and why I have also explored ways in which evolutionary theory can be integrated with recent discoveries in molecular and physiological biology (Noble et al., 2014).\n\nWaddington's concepts are also highly relevant to biologists interested in the ways in which organisms adapt to their environment, and to comparative biologists interested in how this varies between species. Many of the ways in which modern epigenetics plays an essential role in these fields have been described in a special issue of this journal (see overview by Knight, 2015). The discovery of epigenetic marking of DNA and its associated chromatin proteins has opened up new vistas for experimental biology.\n\nI conclude this article with a warning: if you are inspired to try to repeat Waddington's 1956 experiment, do remember that you will fail if you try to do it on a cloned laboratory population. The mechanism depends on using a wild population with natural genetic diversity. In this respect it resembles a phenomenon first noted by James Baldwin (1896). This is that individuals in a population with the \u2018correct\u2019 allele combinations could choose a new environment and so permanently change the evolutionary development in that environment. It resembles Waddington's idea, as he himself recognised, because it does not require new mutations. More recently, Karl Popper, the great logician of science, also noted the possible importance of genetic assimilation without mutations in evolutionary theory (Niemann, 2014; Noble, 2014). Popper and Waddington had both taken part in discussions on evolutionary biology during the 1930s and 1940s when the field of molecular biology was still developing (Niemann, 2014).\n\nWhile celebrating the recent rapid rise in epigenetics research (see Hoppeler, 2015; Knight, 2015), let's also celebrate the father of epigenetics, Conrad Waddington, who opened our eyes to the rich opportunities of adaptation through epigenetic regulation.\n\nReferences\n\nArthur , W. 2010 ).

These theories share in common the premise that the valuation of all market products depends on a Darwinian process. Specific market commodities are evaluated in terms of the degree to which they conform to specific valuations emanating from the consumers. On the one hand, some of these economic theories are consistent with theories of evolutionary psychology that see preferences as determined largely genetically; as such, they hold that the reactions of markets can be predicted in terms of largely fixed human attributes. The dominant neo-Keynesian (see economics: Keynesian economics ) and monetarist schools of economics make predictions of the macroscopic behaviour of economies (see macroeconomics ) based the interrelationship of a few variables; money supply , rate of inflation, and rate of unemployment jointly determine the rate of economic growth . On the other hand, some minority economists, such as the 20th-century Austrian-born British theorist F.A. Hayek and his followers, predicate the Darwinian process on individual preferences that are mostly underdetermined and change in erratic or unpredictable ways. According to them, old ways of producing goods and services are continuously replaced by new inventions and behaviours. These theorists affirm that what drives the economy is the ingenuity of individuals and corporations and their ability to bring new and better products to the market.\n\nDarwin \u2019s notion of natural selection also has been extended to areas of human discourse outside the scientific setting, particularly in the fields of sociopolitical theory and economics. The extension can be only metaphoric, because in Darwin\u2019s intended meaning natural selection applies only to hereditary variations in entities endowed with biological reproduction\u2014that is, to living organisms. That natural selection is a natural process in the living world has been taken by some as a justification for ruthless competition and for \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d in the struggle for economic advantage or for political hegemony . Social Darwinism was an influential social philosophy in some circles through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was used as a rationalization for racism, colonialism, and social stratification. At the other end of the political spectrum , Marxist theorists have resorted to evolution by natural selection as an explanation for humankind\u2019s political history.\n\nTo generate computer programs that represent proficient solutions to a problem under study, the computer scientist creates a set of step-by-step procedures, called a genetic algorithm or, more broadly, an evolutionary algorithm , that incorporates analogies of genetic processes\u2014for instance, heredity , mutation , and recombination \u2014as well as of evolutionary processes such as natural selection in the presence of specified environments . The algorithm is designed typically to simulate the biological evolution of a population of individual computer programs through successive generations to improve their \u201cfitness\u201d for carrying out a designated task. Each program in an initial population receives a fitness score that measures how well it performs in a specific \u201cenvironment\u201d\u2014for example, how efficiently it sorts a list of numbers or allocates the floor space in a new factory design. Only those with the highest scores are selected to \u201creproduce,\u201d to contribute \u201chereditary\u201d material\u2014i.e., computer code\u2014to the following generation of programs. The rules of reproduction may involve such elements as recombination (strings of code from the best programs are shuffled and combined into the programs of the next generation) and mutation (bits of code in a few of the new programs are changed at random). The evolutionary algorithm then evaluates each program in the new generation for fitness, winnows out the poorer performers, and allows reproduction to take place once again, with the cycle repeating itself as often as desired. Evolutionary algorithms are simplistic compared with biological evolution, but they have provided robust and powerful mechanisms for finding solutions to all sorts of problems in economics, industrial production, and the distribution of goods and services. (See also artificial intelligence: Evolutionary computing .)\n\nToward the end of the 20th century, specific concepts and processes borrowed from biological evolution and living systems were incorporated into computational research, beginning with the work of the American mathematician John Holland and others. One outcome of this endeavour was the development of methods for automatically generating computer-based systems that are proficient at given tasks. These systems have a wide variety of potential uses, such as solving practical computational problems, providing machines with the ability to learn from experience, and modeling processes in fields as diverse as ecology, immunology, economics, and even biological evolution itself.\n\nThe term evolution and the general concept of change through time also have penetrated into scientific language well beyond biology and even into common language. Astrophysicists speak of the evolution of the solar system or of the universe; geologists, of the evolution of Earth\u2019s interior; psychologists, of the evolution of the mind; anthropologists, of the evolution of cultures; art historians, of the evolution of architectural styles; and couturiers, of the evolution of fashion. These and other disciplines use the word with only the slightest commonality of meaning\u2014the notion of gradual, and perhaps directional, change over the course of time.\n\nSince Darwin, the theory of evolution has gradually extended its influence to other biological disciplines, from physiology to ecology and from biochemistry to systematics . All biological knowledge now includes the phenomenon of evolution. In the words of Theodosius Dobzhansky , \u201cNothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\u201d\n\nBut the theory of evolution goes far beyond the general affirmation that organisms evolve. The second and third issues\u2014seeking to ascertain evolutionary relationships between particular organisms and the events of evolutionary history, as well as to explain how and why evolution takes place\u2014are matters of active scientific investigation. Some conclusions are well established. One, for example, is that the chimpanzee and the gorilla are more closely related to humans than is any of those three species to the baboon or other monkeys. Another conclusion is that natural selection, the process postulated by Darwin, explains the configuration of such adaptive features as the human eye and the wings of birds. Many matters are less certain, others are conjectural, and still others\u2014such as the characteristics of the first living things and when they came about\u2014remain completely unknown.\n\nThe first issue is the most fundamental and the one established with utmost certainty. Darwin gathered much evidence in its support, but evidence has accumulated continuously ever since, derived from all biological disciplines . The evolutionary origin of organisms is today a scientific conclusion established with the kind of certainty attributable to such scientific concepts as the roundness of Earth , the motions of the planets, and the molecular composition of matter. This degree of certainty beyond reasonable doubt is what is implied when biologists say that evolution is a \u201cfact\u201d; the evolutionary origin of organisms is accepted by virtually every biologist.\n\nThe theory of evolution makes statements about three different, though related, issues: (1) the fact of evolution\u2014that is, that organisms are related by common descent; (2) evolutionary history\u2014the details of when lineages split from one another and of the changes that occurred in each lineage; and (3) the mechanisms or processes by which evolutionary change occurs.\n\nReligious criticism and acceptance\n\nThe theory of evolution has been seen by some people as incompatible with religious beliefs, particularly those of Christianity. The first chapters of the biblical book of Genesis describe God\u2019s creation of the world, the plants, the animals, and human beings. A literal interpretation of Genesis seems incompatible with the gradual evolution of humans and other organisms by natural processes. Independently of the biblical narrative, the Christian beliefs in the immortality of the soul and in humans as \u201ccreated in the image of God\u201d have appeared to many as contrary to the evolutionary origin of humans from nonhuman animals.\n\nReligiously motivated attacks started during Darwin\u2019s lifetime. In 1874 Charles Hodge, an American Protestant theologian, published What Is Darwinism?, one of the most articulate assaults on evolutionary theory. Hodge perceived Darwin\u2019s theory as \u201cthe most thoroughly naturalistic that can be imagined and far more atheistic than that of his predecessor Lamarck.\u201d He argued that the design of the human eye evinces that \u201cit has been planned by the Creator, like the design of a watch evinces a watchmaker.\u201d He concluded that \u201cthe denial of design in nature is actually the denial of God.\u201d\n\nOther Protestant theologians saw a solution to the difficulty through the argument that God operates through intermediate causes. The origin and motion of the planets could be explained by the law of gravity and other natural processes without denying God\u2019s creation and providence. Similarly, evolution could be seen as the natural process through which God brought living beings into existence and developed them according to his plan. Thus, A.H. Strong, the president of Rochester Theological Seminary in New York state, wrote in his Systematic Theology (1885): \u201cWe grant the principle of evolution, but we regard it as only the method of divine intelligence.\u201d The brutish ancestry of human beings was not incompatible with their excelling status as creatures in the image of God. Strong drew an analogy with Christ\u2019s miraculous conversion of water into wine: \u201cThe wine in the miracle was not water because water had been used in the making of it, nor is man a brute because the brute has made some contributions to its creation.\u201d Arguments for and against Darwin\u2019s theory came from Roman Catholic theologians as well.\n\nGradually, well into the 20th century, evolution by natural selection came to be accepted by the majority of Christian writers. Pope Pius XII in his encyclical Humani generis (1950; \u201cOf the Human Race\u201d) acknowledged that biological evolution was compatible with the Christian faith, although he argued that God\u2019s intervention was necessary for the creation of the human soul. Pope John Paul II, in an address to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on October 22, 1996, deplored interpreting the Bible\u2019s texts as scientific statements rather than religious teachings, adding:\n\nNew scientific knowledge has led us to realize that the theory of evolution is no longer a mere hypothesis. It is indeed remarkable that this theory has been progressively accepted by researchers, following a series of discoveries in various fields of knowledge. The convergence, neither sought nor fabricated, of the results of work that was conducted independently is in itself a significant argument in favor of this theory.\n\nSimilar views were expressed by other mainstream Christian denominations. The General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church in 1982 adopted a resolution stating that \u201cBiblical scholars and theological schools\u2026find that the scientific theory of evolution does not conflict with their interpretation of the origins of life found in Biblical literature.\u201d The Lutheran World Federation in 1965 affirmed that \u201cevolution\u2019s assumptions are as much around us as the air we breathe and no more escapable. At the same time theology\u2019s affirmations are being made as responsibly as ever. In this sense both science and religion are here to stay, and\u2026need to remain in a healthful tension of respect toward one another.\u201d Similar statements have been advanced by Jewish authorities and those of other major religions. In 1984 the 95th Annual Convention of the Central Conference of American Rabbis adopted a resolution stating: \u201cWhereas the principles and concepts of biological evolution are basic to understanding science\u2026we call upon science teachers and local school authorities in all states to demand quality textbooks that are based on modern, scientific knowledge and that exclude \u2018scientific\u2019 creationism.\u201d\n\nOpposing these views were Christian denominations that continued to hold a literal interpretation of the Bible. A succinct expression of this interpretation is found in the Statement of Belief of the Creation Research Society, founded in 1963 as a \u201cprofessional organization of trained scientists and interested laypersons who are firmly committed to scientific special creation\u201d (see creationism):\n\nThe Bible is the Written Word of God, and because it is inspired throughout, all of its assertions are historically and scientifically true in the original autographs. To the student of nature this means that the account of origins in Genesis is a factual presentation of simple historical truths.\n\nMany Bible scholars and theologians have long rejected a literal interpretation as untenable, however, because the Bible contains incompatible statements. The very beginning of the book of Genesis presents two different creation narratives. Extending through chapter 1 and the first verses of chapter 2 is the familiar six-day narrative, in which God creates human beings\u2014both \u201cmale and female\u201d\u2014in his own image on the sixth day, after creating light, Earth, firmament, fish, fowl, and cattle. But in verse 4 of chapter 2 a different narrative starts, in which God creates a male human, then plants a garden and creates the animals, and only then proceeds to take a rib from the man to make a woman.\n\nBiblical scholars point out that the Bible is inerrant with respect to religious truth, not in matters that are of no significance to salvation. Augustine, considered by many the greatest Christian theologian, wrote in the early 5th century in his De Genesi ad litteram (Literal Commentary on Genesis):\n\nIt is also frequently asked what our belief must be about the form and shape of heaven, according to Sacred Scripture. Many scholars engage in lengthy discussions on these matters, but the sacred writers with their deeper wisdom have omitted them. Such subjects are of no profit for those who seek beatitude. And what is worse, they take up very precious time that ought to be given to what is spiritually beneficial. What concern is it of mine whether heaven is like a sphere and Earth is enclosed by it and suspended in the middle of the universe, or whether heaven is like a disk and the Earth is above it and hovering to one side.\n\nAugustine adds later in the same chapter: \u201cIn the matter of the shape of heaven, the sacred writers did not wish to teach men facts that could be of no avail for their salvation.\u201d Augustine is saying that the book of Genesis is not an elementary book of astronomy. It is a book about religion, and it is not the purpose of its religious authors to settle questions about the shape of the universe that are of no relevance whatsoever to how to seek salvation.\n\nIn the same vein, John Paul II said in 1981:\n\nThe Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer. Any other teaching about the origin and make-up of the universe is alien to the intentions of the Bible, which does not wish to teach how the heavens were made but how one goes to heaven.\n\nJohn Paul\u2019s argument was clearly a response to Christian fundamentalists who see in Genesis a literal description of how the world was created by God. In modern times biblical fundamentalists have made up a minority of Christians, but they have periodically gained considerable public and political influence, particularly in the United States. Opposition to the teaching of evolution in the United States can largely be traced to two movements with 19th-century roots, Seventh-day Adventism (see Adventist) and Pentecostalism. Consistent with their emphasis on the seventh-day Sabbath as a memorial of the biblical Creation, Seventh-day Adventists have insisted on the recent creation of life and the universality of the Flood, which they believe deposited the fossil-bearing rocks. This distinctively Adventist interpretation of Genesis became the hard core of \u201ccreation science\u201d in the late 20th century and was incorporated into the \u201cbalanced-treatment\u201d laws of Arkansas and Louisiana (discussed below). Many Pentecostals, who generally endorse a literal interpretation of the Bible, also have adopted and endorsed the tenets of creation science, including the recent origin of Earth and a geology interpreted in terms of the Flood. They have differed from Seventh-day Adventists and other adherents of creation science, however, in their tolerance of diverse views and the limited import they attribute to the evolution-creation controversy.\n\nDuring the 1920s, biblical fundamentalists helped influence more than 20 state legislatures to debate antievolution laws, and four states\u2014Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Tennessee\u2014prohibited the teaching of evolution in their public schools. A spokesman for the antievolutionists was William Jennings Bryan, three times the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for the U.S. presidency, who said in 1922, \u201cWe will drive Darwinism from our schools.\u201d In 1925 Bryan took part in the prosecution (see Scopes Trial) of John T. Scopes, a high-school teacher in Dayton, Tennessee, who had admittedly violated the state\u2019s law forbidding the teaching of evolution.\n\nIn 1968 the Supreme Court of the United States declared unconstitutional any law banning the teaching of evolution in public schools. After that time Christian fundamentalists introduced bills in a number of state legislatures ordering that the teaching of \u201cevolution science\u201d be balanced by allocating equal time to creation science. Creation science maintains that all kinds of organisms abruptly came into existence when God created the universe, that the world is only a few thousand years old, and that the biblical Flood was an actual event that only one pair of each animal species survived. In the 1980s Arkansas and Louisiana passed acts requiring the balanced treatment of evolution science and creation science in their schools, but opponents successfully challenged the acts as violations of the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state. The Arkansas statute was declared unconstitutional in federal court after a public trial in Little Rock. The Louisiana law was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled Louisiana\u2019s \u201cCreationism Act\u201d unconstitutional because, by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind, which is embraced by the phrase creation science, the act impermissibly endorses religion."}, {"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/biology-philosophy/", "page_content": "First published Fri Jul 4, 2008; substantive revision Mon Jun 1, 2020\n\nPhilosophy of biology can also be subdivided by the particular areas of the life sciences with which it is concerned. Biology is an extremely diverse set of disciplines, ranging from historical sciences such as paleontology to engineering sciences such as biotechnology. Different philosophical issues occur in each field. The latter part of the entry discusses how philosophers have approached some of the main disciplines within biology.\n\nThe growth of philosophical interest in biology over the past forty years reflects the increasing prominence of the biological sciences in the same period. There is now an extensive literature on many different biological topics, and it would be impossible to summarise this body of work in this single entry. Instead, this entry sets out to explain what philosophy of biology is. Why does biology matter to philosophy and vice versa? A list of the entries in the encyclopedia which address specific topics in the philosophy of biology is provided at the end of the entry.\n\n1. Pre-history of Philosophy of Biology\n\nAs is the case for most apparent novelties, closer inspection reveals a pre-history for the philosophy of biology (Grene & Depew 2004). In the 1950s the biologist J. H. Woodger and the philosopher Morton Beckner both published major works on the philosophy of biology (Woodger 1952; Beckner 1959), but these did not give rise to a subsequent philosophical literature (though see Ruse 1988). Some philosophers of science also made claims about biology based on general epistemological and metaphysical considerations. One of the most famous examples is J. J. C. Smart\u2019s claim that the biology is not an autonomous science, but a technological application of more basic sciences, like \u201cradio-engineering\u201d (Smart 1959, 366). Like engineering, biology cannot make any addition to the laws of nature. It can only reveal how the laws of physics and chemistry play out in the context of particular sorts of initial and boundary conditions (for more recent discussions of biological laws, see Beatty 1995; Brandon 1997; Mitchell 1997; Sober 1997; Waters 1998). Even in 1969 the zoologist Ernst Mayr could complain that books with \u2018philosophy of science\u2019 in the title were all misleading and should be re-titled \u2018philosophy of physics\u2019 (Mayr 1969). It is worth noting however that philosophers of science such as Carl G. Hempel (1965) and Ernest Nagel (1961) offered accounts of functional explanation as found in the biological sciences. The encouragement of prominent biologists such as Mayr and F. J. Ayala (Ayala 1976; Mayr 1982) was one factor in the emergence of the new field. Another factor was that several philosophers of science including Robert Brandon, Phillip Kitcher, Elisabeth Lloyd, Sahotra Sarkar, Elliott Sober, and William C. Wimsatt did research at Harvard University with the likes of Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin, and Richard Levins (Callebaut 1993). The first sign of philosophy of biology becoming a mainstream part of philosophy of science was the publication of David Hull\u2019s Philosophy of Biological Science in the prominent Prentice-Hall Foundations of Philosophy series (Hull 1974). From then on the field developed rapidly. Robert Brandon could say of the late 1970\u2019s that \u201cI knew five philosophers of biology: Marjorie Grene, David Hull, Michael Ruse, Mary Williams and William Wimsatt.\u201d (Brandon 1996, xii\u2013xiii) By 1986, however, there were more than enough to fill the pages of Michael Ruse\u2019s new journal Biology and Philosophy. This trend has only increased with the introduction of additional journals such as Biological Theory, Philosophy and Practice of Biology, History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences, and Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences.\n\n2. Three Types of Philosophy of Biology\n\nThree different kinds of philosophical inquiry fall under the general heading of philosophy of biology. First, general theses in the philosophy of science are addressed in the context of biology. Second, conceptual (or theoretical) problems within biology itself are subjected to philosophical analysis. Third, appeals to biology are made in discussions of traditional philosophical questions. The first major debate in the philosophy of biology exemplified the first of these, the use of genetics to explore reductionism and anti-reductionism in the philosophy of science. Kenneth F. Schaffner applied the logical empiricist model of theory reduction to the relationship between classical, Mendelian genetics and molecular genetics (Schaffner 1967a; Schaffner 1967b; Schaffner 1969). David Hull argued that the lesson of this attempt was that Mendelian genetics is irreducible to molecular genetics (Hull 1974; Hull 1975). This debate reinforced the near-consensus in the 1970s and 1980s that the special sciences are autonomous from the more fundamental sciences (Fodor 1974; Kitcher 1984). However, the apparent absurdity of the claim that the molecular revolution in biology was not a successful instance of scientific reduction also led the formulation of increasingly more adequate models of theory reduction (Wimsatt 1976; Wimsatt 1980; Schaffner 1993; Waters 1994; Rosenberg 1997; Sarkar 1998).\n\nIn another important early debate philosophers set out to solve a conceptual problem within biology itself. The concept of reproductive fitness is at the heart of evolutionary theory, but its status has always been problematic. It has proved surprisingly hard for biologists to avoid the criticism that, \u201c[i]f we try to make laws of evolution in the strict sense we seem to reduce to tautologies. Thus suppose we say that even in Andromeda \u2018the fittest will survive\u2019 we say nothing, for \u2018fittest\u2019 has to be defined in terms of \u2018survival\u2019\u201d (Smart 1959, 366). This came to be know as the \u201ctautology problem\u201d. Alexander Rosenberg and Mary B. Williams argued that fitness is an irreducible primitive which derives its meaning from its place in an axiomatic formulation of evolutionary theory (Rosenberg 1983; Sober 1984a; Williams and Rosenberg 1985). If correct, this would solve the tautology problem since axioms are often thought of as tautologous. In the 1970\u2019s the new generation of philosophers of biology offered a different solution to the tautology problem in two steps. First, they began by arguing that fitness is a supervenient property of organisms: the fitness of each particular organism is necessarily dependent on some specific set of physical characteristics of the organism and its particular environment, but two organisms that have the same fitness may do so in virtue very different sets of physical characteristics (Rosenberg 1978). Second, they argued that this supervenient property is a propensity \u2013 which is a probabilistic disposition represented by a probability distribution over possible numbers of offspring (Mills and Beatty 1979). Although fitness is defined in terms of reproductive success, it is not a tautology that the fittest organisms have the most offspring, any more than it is a tautology that dice produce even numbers more often than they produce sixes. The propensities of fit organisms to survive and of dice to fall equally often on each side both allow us to make fallible predictions about what will happen, predictions that become more reliable as the size of the sample increases. It remains unclear, however, whether it is possible to specify a probability distribution or set of distributions that can play all the roles actually played by fitness in population biology (Beatty & Finsen 1989, Sober 2001; Pence & Ramsey 2013).\n\nThe phrase \u2018conceptual problems\u2019 should be understood very broadly. The conceptual work done by philosophers of biology in many cases merges smoothly into theoretical biology. It also sometimes leads philosophers to examine and criticize the chains of argument constructed by biologists, and thus to enter directly into ongoing biological debates. In the same way, the first kind of philosophy of biology we have described \u2013 the use of biological examples to work through general issues in the philosophy of science \u2013 sometimes feeds back into biology itself through specific recommendations for improving biological methodology. It is a striking feature of the philosophy of biology literature that philosophers often publish in biology journals and that biologists often contribute to philosophy of biology journals. The philosophy of biology also has a potentially important role as a mediator between biology and society. Popular representations of biology derive broad lessons from large swathes of experimental findings and theoretical work. Philosophers of science have an obvious role in evaluating these interpretations of the significance of specific biological findings (Stotz and Griffiths 2008). As two important examples, philosophers of biology have provided a great deal of clarity regarding creationism/intelligent design (Kitcher 1982; Ruse 1982; Pennock 2000; Sarkar 2007) and sociobiology/evolutionary psychology (Kitcher 1985; Buller 2006; Richardson 2010; Barker 2015).\n\nA third form of philosophy of biology occurs when philosophers appeal to biology to support positions on traditional philosophical topics, such as ethics or epistemology. The extensive literature on biological teleology is a case in point. After a brief flurry of interest in the wake of the \u201cmodern synthesis\u201d, during which the term \u2018teleonomy\u2019 was introduced to denote the specifically evolutionary interpretation of teleological language (Pittendrigh 1958), the ideas of function and goal directedness came to be regarded as relatively unproblematic by evolutionary biologists. In the 1970s, however, philosophers started to look to biology to provide a solid, scientific basis for normative concepts, such as illness, disorder, or malfunction (Wimsatt 1972; Wright 1973; Boorse 1976). Eventually, the philosophical debate produced an analysis of teleological language fundamentally similar to the view associated with modern synthesis (Millikan 1984; Neander 1991; Godfrey-Smith 1994). According to the \u201cselected effects\u201d theory of function, the functions of a trait are those activities in virtue of which the trait was selected. The idea of proper function has become part of the conceptual toolkit of philosophy in general and of the philosophy of language and the philosophy of mind in particular (Dretske 1991, 1997; Millikan 1995, 2004, 2005; Papineau 1987, 1993; Neander 2017; Garson 2019).\n\n3. Philosophy of Evolutionary Biology\n\nPhilosophy of biology can also be subdivided by the particular areas of biology with which it is concerned. Until recently, evolutionary biology has attracted the lion\u2019s share of philosophical attention. This work has sometimes been designed to support a general thesis in the philosophy of science, such as the \u201csemantic view\u201d or model-based view of theories (Beatty 1980; Lloyd 1988; Thompson 1988). But most of this work is concerned with conceptual problems that arise inside the theory itself, and the work often resembles theoretical biology as much as pure philosophy of science. For example, Elliott Sober\u2019s classic study The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory in Philosophical Focus (Sober 1984b) marks the point at which many philosophers became aware of the philosophy of biology. Sober analyzed the structure of population genetics via an analogy with Newtonian mechanics and the composition of forces, treating the actual change in gene frequencies over time as the result of several different \u201cforces\u201d, such as selection, random genetic drift, mutation, and migration. Several philosophers of biology have challenged this interpretation of evolutionary theory in favor of a \u201cstatistical\u201d approach (Sterelny & Kitcher 1988; Matthen and Ariew 2002; Walsh, Lewens, and Ariew 2002), and this debate continues. Another instance of a conceptual problem in evolutionary theory concerns the nature of random genetic drift. How are selection and drift distinct (Beatty 1987)? We typically think of drift occurring when there is random fluctuation of gene frequencies, but selection in a changing environment can produce the very same pattern. Thus, some philosophers of biology have argued we must distinguish selection and drift as processes rather than just as patterns. One way to do this is through a distinction between indiscriminate and discriminate sampling processes (Millstein 2002; Brandon 2005; Millstein 2005). The question becomes whether the trait of interest is causally irrelevant or relevant to changes in gene frequencies. These examples of careful, methodological analysis of population genetics, the mathematical core of traditional evolutionary theory, continue to give rise to interesting results (Pigliucci and Kaplan 2006; Plutynski 2006; Okasha 2007; Sarkar 2011).\n\nThe intense philosophical interest in evolutionary theory in the 1980\u2019s can partly be explained by two controversies (Segerstr\u00e5le 2000). First, there was a controversy over \u201csociobiology\u201d that was provoked by the publications of E.O. Wilson\u2019s eponymous textbook (Wilson 1975) and his Pulitzer prize winning popular book (Wilson 1978). One extremely important critique of this application of evolutionary biology to human social behavior came from Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin (Gould and Lewontin 1979). The debates over adaptationism turned out to involve a diffuse set of worries about whether evolution produces adaptations, the role of optimality models, and the methodology of evolutionary theory (Amundson 1994; Orzack and Sober 1994; Brandon and Rausher 1996; Godfrey-Smith 2001; Millstein 2007; Forber 2009; Potochnik 2009; Lloyd 2015). Philosophical work has helped to distinguish these strands in the debate and reduce the confusion seen in the heated and polemical biological literature for and against adaptationism (Orzack and Sober 2001). Second, there was the appearance of George Williams\u2019 Adaptation and Natural Selection (Williams 1966) and Richard Dawkins\u2019 The Selfish Gene (Dawkins 1976). They claim that the unit of selection is the individual Mendelian allele rather than the organism, group of organisms, or species. This created an explosion of early philosophical work on the \u201cunits of selection\u201d question (Brandon and Burian 1984). The early debates concerned whether there was a determinate unit of selection and what criteria should be used for determining what it is in a given case (Hull 1980; Wimsatt 1980a, 1980b; Brandon 1982; Sober & Lewontin 1984; Lloyd 1988; Sterelny & Kitcher 1988). As multi-level selection models and the Price equation appeared, close attention turned to how those models should be interpreted (Godfrey-Smith & Lewontin 1993; Godfrey-Smith & Kerr 2002; Lloyd 2005; Waters 2005; Okasha 2006; Birch 2017). For example, for any group selection model, is there an empirically equivalent individual selection model (similarly for genotypic and genic models)? If so, do they represent the very same causal structure? Is kin selection a form of group selection? Arguably, philosophers made a significant contribution to the rehabilitation of some forms of \u201cgroup selection\u201d within evolutionary biology in the 1990s, following two decades of neglect or contempt (Sober and Wilson 1998).\n\n4. Philosophy of Systematic Biology\n\nPhilosophical discussion of systematics was a response to a \u201cscientific revolution\u201d in that discipline in the 1960s and 1970s. This revolution saw the discipline transformed from phenetics and evolutionary taxonomy alongside the application of quantitative methods. The successor was the \u201ccladistic\u201d approach due to Willi Hennig (1966), which argues that the sole aim of systematics should be to represent \u201cnatural\u201d groups of organisms. Cladists took natural groups to be monophyletic groups (where a monophyletic group includes an ancestor species and all of its descendant species). Thus, a cladistic approach only represents phylogeny, which is the pattern of common descent. Philosopher David L. Hull was an active participant in scientific debates throughout these two revolutions; in fact, he was president of the Society of Systematic Zoology in 1984\u20131985 and of the Philosophy of Science Association in 1985\u20131986 (Hull 1965; Hull 1970; Hull 1988; Sober 1988). Additionally, a great deal of conceptual work appeared on the nature of phylogenetic inference. Phylogenies are commonly represented with phylogenetic trees. Discovering phylogenies presents the familiar problem of underdetermination of theory by evidence. For example, if we have four taxa, there are fifteen possible rooted trees. However, only one of those trees corresponds to the actual historical lineage. Additionally, the phylogeny of given taxa cannot be directly observed, and so must be inferred. Thus, the problem of phylogenetic inference is how to justify such historical hypotheses. The original phylogenetic method of choice was parsimony, which says to choose the tree which proposes the fewest evolutionary events. Some phylogenetic systematists argued for this approach using Sir Karl Popper\u2019s falsificationism (Wiley 1975, Farris 1983). In the 1970\u2019s, Joseph Felsenstein demonstrated that lineages with a certain topology were subject to a systematic error in parsimony analysis (Felsenstein 1978, 2004). This is the problem of \u201clong-branch attraction\u201d in which taxa at the end of long branches are mistakenly grouped together by parsimony analysis, instead of with taxa with which they share a more recent common ancestor (Haber 2008). Felsenstein proposed using statistical techniques (in particular maximum likelihood methods) to avoid this problem. Debates between the camps continue (Sober 2004).\n\nThe biologist Michael Ghiselin piqued the interest of philosophers when he suggested that systematics was fundamentally mistaken about the ontological status of biological species (Ghiselin 1974). Species were not natural kinds in the way that chemical elements are. Instead, they are historical particulars like nations or galaxies. They have a beginning through speciation, they have parts that are integrated over time by biological relations, and they cease to exist by going extinct (Mishler & Brandon 1987). Additionally, individual organisms are not instances of species, as a wedding ring is an instance of gold. Instead, they are parts of species, as one is a part of a family. As Smart had earlier noticed, this has the implication that there can be no \u201claws of nature\u201d about biological species per se, at least in the traditional sense of \u2018laws of nature\u2019 (Smart 1959). David Hull further developed and argued for the \u201cspecies as individuals\u201d thesis. He explored its implications for a variety of topics including species names, laws of nature, and human nature (Hull 1976, 1978, 1986).\n\nHowever, the view that species are individuals leaves other important questions about species unsolved and raises new problems of its own (Kitcher 1984, 1989). For example, suppose you are a population biologist and you need to census the individuals in a population of species. How do you decide what entities to count? Philosophers and biologists have provided a variety of criteria for answering questions like this including reproduction, life-cycles, genetics, sex, developmental bottlenecks, germ-soma separation, policing mechanisms, spatial boundaries or contiguity, immune response, fitness maximization, cooperation and/or conflict, codispersal, adaptations, metabolic autonomy, and functional integration (Clarke 2013). So, the question of what a biological individual is indeed a pressing one (Wilson 2005; Okasha 2006; Clarke 2011; Pradeu 2012; Bouchard and Huneman 2013; Clarke 2013; Godfrey-Smith 2013; Wilson and Barker 2013).\n\nBiologists have been, and are still, deeply divided over the species category (Ereshefsky 1992b; Wheeler and Meier 2000; Coyne and Orr 2004; Wilkins 2009). Consider Ernst Mayr\u2019s famous biological species concept (BSC). He writes, \u201cSpecies are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups\u201d (Mayr 1963, 89). There are lots of concerns regarding the BSC (Ehrlich and Raven 1969; Sokal and Crovello 1970; Van Valen 1976; Wiley 1978). Asexual organisms do not interbreed. Thus, on the BSC, there are no species of asexual organisms. Many species exhibit some introgression, and thus cannot be distinct species. Last, the BSC is extremely difficult to apply to species in the fossil record since sex organs do not normally fossilize, and reproductive behavior is difficult to corroborate. In light of the problems with the BSC (and for other reasons), biologists have put forward other species concepts. Species pluralism is the claim that there is no single correct species concept that classifies organisms exactly the same (Ereshefsky 1992a); rather, there are several correct species concepts. That is, for some organisms, different species concepts will correctly place them in distinct species. Species monism is the claim that there is a single correct species concept. Some allege species pluralism is temporary because we will eventually find the single best concept (Hull 1999). The debate between pluralists and monists rages on (Wilson 1999).\n\nBiological species are often given as one of the classic examples of a \u201cnatural kind\u201d. The philosophy of systematics has had a major influence on recent work on classification and natural kinds (Dupr\u00e9 1993, 2002; Wilson et. al. 1997; Boyd 1999; Griffiths 1999; Wilson 1999; Okasha 2001; Walsh 2006). For example, can there be a notion of natural kind or essentialism consistent with the \u201cpopulation thinking\u201d found in biology (Mayr 1975, Sober 1980; Ariew 2008)?\n\n5. Philosophy of Molecular Biology\n\nWe mentioned above that the reduction of Mendelian genetics to molecular genetics was one of the first topics to be discussed in the philosophy of biology. The initial debate between Schaffner and Hull was followed by the so-called \u201canti-reductionist consensus\u201d (Kitcher 1984). The reductionist position was revived in a series of important papers by Kenneth Waters (1990, 1994) and debate over the cognitive relationship between the two disciplines continues today. However, the question is not now framed as a simple choice between reduction and irreducibility (Griffiths 1999; Kitcher 1999; Sober 1999). Rather, a variety of concepts have been introduced and discussed including multiple realizability, realization, and mechanism (Wilson 2005, Craver 2007; Polger & Shapiro 2016). These have been important in thinking about genetics but also neuroscience and cell biology more generally. For example, Lindley Darden, Schaffner and others have argued that explanations in molecular biology are not neatly confined to one ontological level, and hence that ideas of \u2018reduction\u2019 derived from classical examples like the reduction of the phenomenological gas laws to molecular kinematics in nineteenth century physics are simply inapplicable (Darden and Maull 1977; Schaffner 1993). Moreover, molecular biology does not have the kind of grand theory based around a set of laws or a set of mathematical models that is familiar from the physical sciences. Instead, highly specific mechanisms that have been uncovered in detail in one model organism seem to act as \u201cexemplars\u201d allowing the investigation of similar, although not necessarily identical, mechanisms in other organisms that employ the same, or related, molecular interactants. Darden and others have argued that these \u201cmechanisms\u201d \u2013 specific collections of entities and their distinctive activities \u2013 are the fundamental unit of scientific discovery and scientific explanation, not only in molecular biology, but in a wide range of special sciences (Machamer, Darden et al. 2000; Craver & Darden 2013; see also Bechtel and Richardson 1993). There is an interesting question about whether the notion of mechanism aptly applies in other areas of biology (Skipper & Millstein 2005; Havstad 2011).\n\nAnother important topic in the philosophy of molecular biology has been the concept of the gene (Beurton, Falk and Rheinberger 2000; Waters 2000, 2004; Griffiths and Stotz 2007). Philosophers have also written extensively on the concept of genetic information, the general tenor of the literature being that it is difficult to reconstruct this idea precisely in a way that does justice to the apparent weight placed on it by molecular biologists (Sarkar 1996; Maynard Smith 2000; Godfrey-Smith 2001; Griffiths 2001; Jablonka 2002; Rosenberg 2006). For example, does DNA actually carry semantic information (Shea 2007)? If it does not, is this a useful fiction, or is it hindering molecular biology (Levy 2001)?\n\n6. Philosophy of Developmental Biology\n\nThe debates over adaptationism in the 1980\u2019s made philosophers familiar with the complex interactions between explanations of traits in evolutionary biology and explanations of the same traits in developmental biology. Developmental biology throws light on the kinds of variation that are likely to be available for selection, posing the question of how far the results of evolution can be understood in terms of the options that were available (\u201cdevelopmental constraints\u201d) rather than the natural selection of those options (Maynard Smith, Burian et al. 1985). The debate over developmental constraints looked at developmental biology solely from the perspective of whether it could provide answers to evolutionary questions. However, as Ron Amundson pointed out, developmental biologists are addressing questions of their own, and, he argued, a different concept of constraint is needed to address those questions (Amundson 1994). The emergence in the 1990\u2019s of a new field promising to unite both kinds of explanation, evolutionary developmental biology, has given rise to a substantial philosophical literature aimed at characterizing this field from a methodological viewpoint (Gray 1992; Griffiths and Gray 1994; Oyama 2000a, 2000b; Oyama, Griffiths, and Gray 2001; Maienschein and Laubichler 2004; Robert 2004; Amundson 2005; Brandon and Sansom 2007). For example, developmental systems theorists (Gray 1992; Griffiths and Gray 1994; Oyama 2000a, 2000b; Oyama, Griffiths, and Gray 2001) argue for \u201cparity\u201d between genes and non-genetic factors. First, organisms inherit a \u201cdevelopmental matrix\u201d and not just genes (e.g. \u201cepigenetic inheritance\u201d). Second, the role of genes is in the development of traits is not causally unique \u2013 insofar as genes \u201ccarry information\u201d or are \u201ccopied\u201d the same can be said of other factors. That is, genes and developmental factors causally covary with phenotypic traits. However, defenders of \u201cextended replicators\u201d argue that genes uniquely carry information in a teleosemantic sense (Sterelny et. al. 1996). Another source of philosophical controversy in developmental biology concerns whether any traits are innate and what innateness might be (Ariew 1999; Griffiths 2002; Mameli and Bateson 2006). Philosophers have contributed to clarifying the difference concepts at issue.\n\n7. Philosophy of Ecology and Conservation Biology\n\nUntil recently this was an extremely underdeveloped field in the philosophy of biology. This is surprising, because there is obvious potential for all three of the approaches to philosophy of biology discussed above. There is also a substantial body of philosophical work in environmental ethics, and answering the questions that arise there would require a critical examination of ecology and conservation biology (Brennan 2014). Over the last twenty years, this field has developed rapidly (Colyvan et. al. 2009).\n\nPhilosophers have started to remedy the neglect of ecology and a number of major books have appeared (Cooper 2003, Ginzburg and Colyvan 2004, Sarkar 2005, MacLaurin and Sterelny 2008). The discussions have focused on several topics including the complicated and sometimes troubled relationship between mathematical models and empirical data in ecology (Shrader-Frechette & McCoy 1993; Ginzburg and Colyvan 2004; Odenbaugh 2005; Weisberg 2012), whether there are distinctive ecological laws (Cooper 2003; Mikkelson 2003; Lange 2005; Eliot 2011b, Linquist et. al. 2016), the nature and reality of ecological communities and ecosystems (Sterelny 2006; Odenbaugh 2007; Eliot 2011), the \u201crobustness\u201c of ecological principles (Odenbaugh 2003; Weisberg & Reisman 2008; Justus 2012), the idea of ecological stability and the \u201cbalance of nature\u201d (Odenbaugh 2001; Cooper 2003; Mikkelson 2001; Justus 2008), the definition of biodiversity (Sarkar 2005; MacLaurin and Sterelny 2008; Santana 2014), and the relationship between ecology and conservation biology (Linquist 2008). Recently, there has been interesting work done on functions in ecology as well (Jax, 2005; Odenbaugh 2010; Nunes-Neto et. al. 2014; Dussault & Bouchard 2017). Most ecologists and evolutionary biologists do not think communities or ecosystems are units of selection, and thus the selected-effects account of functions does not readily apply. So, philosophers of ecology have been exploring alternatives.\n\n8. Methodology in Philosophy of Biology and Future Directions\n\nMost work in the philosophy of biology is self-consciously naturalistic, recognizing no profound discontinuity in either method or content between philosophy and science. Ideally, philosophy of biology differs from biology itself not in its knowledge base, but only in the questions it asks. The philosopher aims to engage with the content of biology at a professional level, although typically with greater knowledge of its history than biologists themselves, and fewer hands-on skills. It is common for philosophers of biology to have academic credentials in the fields that are the focus of their research, and to be closely involved with scientific collaborators. Philosophy of biology\u2019s naturalism and the continuity of its concerns with science itself is shared with much other recent work in the philosophy of science, perhaps most notably in the philosophy of neuroscience (Bechtel, Mandik et al. 2001).\n\nEven the distinction between the questions of biology and those of philosophy of biology is not absolutely clear. As noted above, philosophers of biology address three types of questions: general questions about the nature of science, conceptual problems within biology, and traditional philosophical questions that seem open to illumination from the biosciences. When addressing the second sort of question, there is no clear distinction between philosophy of biology and theoretical biology. But while this can lead to the accusation that philosophers of biology have abandoned their calling for \u2018science reporting\u2019 it can equally well be said that a book like The Selfish Gene (Dawkins 1976) is primarily a contribution to philosophical discussion of biology. Certainly, the professional skills of the philosopher are as relevant to these internal conceptual puzzles as they are to the other two types of question. All three types of question can be related to the specific findings of the biological sciences only by complex chains of argument.\n\nThere is a great deal of new work being in done in the philosophy of biology. As examples, there is a rich philosophical literature emerging around cancer (Plutynski 2018), cultural evolution (Sterelny 2012; Lewens 2015; O\u2019Connor 2019), human nature (Machery 2008; Ramsey 2013; Kronfeldner 2018), microbiology (O\u2019Malley 2014), and paleobiology (Turner 2011; Currie 2018). Philosophy of biology still remains one of the most dynamic and interesting areas of the philosophy of science and philosophy more generally."}, {"url": "https://www.springer.com/journal/11692", "page_content": "A forum for broad syntheses, in-depth treatment and controversial ideas in evolutionary biology\n\nBrings critical reviews, original research and commentaries to greater understanding of the origins and diversity of life\n\nAdapts the acclaimed format of the book serial to today's publication environment\n\n100% of authors who answered a survey reported that they would definitely publish or probably publish in the journal again\n\nEvolutionary Biology is dedicated to the view that evolutionary theory is a unifying framework for the biosciences.
