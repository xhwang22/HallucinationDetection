At 65 percent, turnout was up 4 percent over 2005, when Tony Blair had led his Labour Party to its third successive majority. In 2010, however, Blair was not a candidate, having turned over the reins of government to Gordon Brown, his longtime chancellor of the Exchequer. Sagging poll numbers for Labour and a resurgent Conservative Party under the youthful David Cameron brought the assumption that the Conservatives would cruise to a parliamentary majority for the first time since 1997.\n\nIn the months before the 2010 election, the Conservatives held a solid lead in the public opinion polls, but there were persistent lingering doubts about the readiness of Cameron and his team to govern, and, as election day neared, the Conservative lead declined. The 2010 campaign brought a novelty to the British general election campaign\u2014televised debates between the leaders of the three main parties: Brown of Labour, Cameron of the Conservatives, and Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats. (The Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party protested their exclusion.) This brought great anticipation and introduced a wild card into the campaign. Clegg\u2019s performance in the first debate brought a great surge to the Liberal Democrats, with some polls released in the days after the debate putting the Lib Dems in first or second place, ahead of Labour. Following the second and third debates, however, some of the surge by the Lib Dems receded, and the Conservative lead grew once again.\n\nOn election night the Lib Dems finished a distant third, with 57 seats (a net loss of 5 seats from 2005). The Conservatives, at 306 seats, emerged as the largest party by far but without a majority, gaining 97 seats over their notional 2005 total (i.e., basing the 2005 results on the 2010 constituency boundaries). The clear loser was Labour, which lost 91 of its seats and fared particularly poorly in the south of England. (One English seat, Thirsk and Malton, was uncontested on election day, because of the death of the United Kingdom Independence Party candidate.) Indeed, all but nine of the seats the Conservatives won were in England.\n\nThe election also brought some other surprises. The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland won its first seat ever in the House of Commons, ousting Democratic Unionist Party leader Peter Robinson. The Green Party also won its first seat, capturing the seat of Brighton Pavilion along the southern coast. And, surprisingly, though there was a strong swing away from Labour in much of the country, the Labour share of the vote held up rather well in Scotland and Wales.\n\nClegg indicated that the Conservatives, as the largest party, should have the right to attempt to form a government, but, with no party securing a majority and with most parties unlikely coalition partners for the Conservatives, it remained unclear who would become prime minister. Negotiations between Cameron and Clegg began in earnest on May 7, and on May 10 Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the Labour Party. The following day Brown announced his resignation as prime minister and as leader of the Labour Party, and Cameron subsequently became prime minister.\n\nThe Conservatives and Liberal Democrats formed a coalition government\u2014Britain\u2019s first since World War II\u2014with Clegg taking the post of deputy prime minister. Conservatives William Hague (foreign secretary) and George Osborne (chancellor of the Exchequer) were among the leading cabinet appointments. Several Liberal Democrats, including Chris Huhne (secretary of state for energy and climate change), also took cabinet posts. As part of the power-sharing agreement, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems agreed to set out a plan for deficit reduction in an emergency budget to be presented within 50 days of taking office. They also agreed to a fixed five-year Parliament that called for the next election to be held on the first Thursday in May in 2015, though dissolution of Parliament and a subsequent election could come earlier through the vote of 55 percent or more of the House of Commons. The coalition partnership called for a referendum on alternative vote, whereby voters indicate a first and second preference, with the second preference being counted only if no candidate receives a majority\u2014which fell short of the Lib Dems\u2019 goal of full proportional representation.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

The history of the legislative body\u2014which meets in the Palace of Westminster in London\u2014shows how it evolved almost organically, partly in response to the needs of the country\u2019s reigning monarch. Parliament traces its roots back to the earliest meetings of English barons and commoners in the 8th century.\n\nParliament\u2019s Humble Beginnings\n\nThe present-day Parliament is a bicameral (\u201ctwo chambers\u201d) legislature with a House of Lords and a House of Commons. These two houses, however, weren\u2019t always joined, and had their earliest beginnings in the Anglo-Saxon council governments of the 8th century.\n\nThe Witan was a small council of clergymen, land-owning barons and other advisors chosen by the king to discuss matters of state, taxation and other political affairs. As it expanded to include more advisors, the Witan evolved into the magnum concilium or Great Council.\n\nOn a local level, \u201cmoots\u201d were meetings of local bishops, lords, sheriffs and, importantly, commoners who were representatives of their counties or \u201cshires.\u201d\n\nThese institutions functioned\u2014with varying degrees of success\u2014as law-making bodies and law enforcement agencies throughout England during the Middle Ages. The two bodies didn\u2019t regularly convene, but they paved the way to the bicameral legislature that exists today.\n\nMagna Carta\n\nThe first English Parliament was convened in 1215, with the creation and signing of the Magna Carta, which established the rights of barons (wealthy landowners) to serve as consultants to the king on governmental matters in his Great Council.\n\nAs in the early Witans, these barons were not elected, but rather selected and appointed by the king. The Great Council was first referred to as \u201cParliament\u201d in 1236.\n\nBy 1254, the sheriffs of the various counties in England were instructed to send elected representatives of their districts (knowns as \u201cknights of the shire\u201d) to consult with the king on issues related to taxation. Four years later, at the English university town of Oxford, the noblemen who served in Parliament at the time drafted the \u201cProvisions of Oxford,\u201d which called for regular meetings of the legislative body, composed of representatives from each of the counties.\n\nIn 1295, Parliament evolved to include nobles and bishops as well as two representatives from each of the counties and towns in England and, since 1282, Wales. This became the model for the composition of all future Parliaments.\n\nRichard II Deposed\n\nOver the course of the next century, the membership of Parliament was divided into the two houses it features today, with the noblemen and bishops encompassing the House of Lords and the knights of the shire and local representatives (known as \u201cburgesses\u201d) making up the House of Commons.\n\nDuring this time, too, Parliament began to take on more authority within the English government. In 1362, for example, it passed a statute decreeing that Parliament must approve all taxation.\n\nFourteen years later, the House of Commons tried and impeached a number of the king\u2019s advisors. And, in 1399, after years of internal struggle for power between the monarchy and Parliament, the legislative body voted to depose King Richard II, enabling Henry IV to assume the throne.\n\nParliament\u2019s Power Expands\n\nDuring Henry IV\u2019s time on the throne, the role of Parliament expanded beyond the determination of taxation policy to include the \u201credress of grievances,\u201d which essentially enabled English citizens to petition the body to address complaints in their local towns and counties. By this time, citizens were given the power to vote to elect their representatives\u2014the burgesses\u2014to the House of Commons.\n\nIn 1414, Henry IV\u2019s son, Henry V, assumed the throne and became the first monarch to acknowledge that the approval and consultation of both houses of Parliament was required to make new laws. Still, all was not perfect in England\u2019s fledgling democracy.\n\nMore than 100 years later, in 1523, philosopher and writer Sir Thomas More, a Member of Parliament (M.P. for short), was the first to raise the issue of \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d for lawmakers in both houses during deliberations. A half-century hence, during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in 1576, Peter Wentworth, M.P., made an impassioned speech arguing for the same right; he was sentenced to imprisonment in the Tower of London.\n\nWentworth, a Puritan, later clashed with Elizabeth I over issues related to freedom of religion during his time as an M.P., and he was jailed for these acts as well. It was this persecution that led the Puritans to leave England for the New World in the 1600s, helping to settle the 13 colonies that eventually became the United States.\n\nEnglish Civil War\n\nFor much of the 17th century, the United Kingdom experienced a great deal of change and political turmoil. Arguably, the one constant was Parliament.\n\nFrom 1603 to 1660, the country was mired in a drawn-out civil war and, for a time, military leader Oliver Cromwell assumed power under the title Lord Protector. The ruling monarch at the time, Charles I, was executed in 1649.\n\nCromwell is best known for conquering Scotland (1649) and Ireland (1651) and bringing them, unwillingly, under the dominion of the United Kingdom. Still, those two nations had their own Parliaments, made up of Cromwell supporters.\n\nParliament continued to retain some power during this period of change. However, M.P.s who were thought to be loyal to Charles I were excluded from the legislature in 1648, creating the so-called \u201cRump Parliament.\u201d\n\nThe Monarchy Abolished\n\nIn 1649, the House of Commons took the unprecedented step of abolishing the monarchy and declaring England a commonwealth.\n\nFour years later, though, Cromwell disbanded the Rump Parliament and created the Nominated Assembly, a de facto legislature. Cromwell died in 1658 and was replaced by his son Richard. The son was deposed a year later, and Britain\u2019s government effectively collapsed.\n\nCharles I\u2019s son, Charles II, was restored to the throne in 1660, reaffirming the monarchy\u2019s place in British history.\n\nNew Parliamentary elections were held. And the M.P.s elected effectively held their seats for the next 18 years, during which no general election was called.\n\nThe Stuart Kings\n\nThe so-called \u201cStuart Kings\u201d\u2014Charles II and his brother James II, who succeeded him in 1685\u2014maintained a similar relationship with the legislature as their father had in the 1640s. However, religion was a major issue dividing English government and society.\n\nWhen Parliament passed the \u201cTest Act,\u201d which prevented Catholics from holding elected office, the legislature was at odds with King James II, himself a Catholic. After years of political in-fighting during the Glorious Revolution, Parliament deposed James II in 1689 and his eldest daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange ascended to the throne.\n\nDuring their brief rule, Parliament was once again elevated to having law-making powers. In fact, when Mary and William died (in 1694 and in 1702, respectively), the legislature established new protocols for succession, and named George of Hanover king.\n\nParliament in Recent History\n\nOver course of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, Parliament and its powers evolved\u2014just as the United Kingdom itself did.\n\nScotland formally became a part of the United Kingdom in 1707, and thus sent representatives to the Parliament at Westminster. By the late 1700s, Ireland was also part of the United Kingdom (the six counties in the north of the island\u2014known collectively as Ulster\u2014remain part of the U.K. today), and land-owners there elected their own representatives to both houses of Parliament.\n\nThrough a series of legislative acts, known as the \u201cReform Acts,\u201d a number of changes were made to the composition and legislative process in Parliament. The Reform Act of 1918 gave women the right to vote, and the first woman was elected to the body that same year.\n\nHowever, Countess Constance Markievicz of Ireland was a member of Sinn Fein, the political party seeking independence for the island nation, and thus refused to serve.\n\nMeanwhile, the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 established greater powers for the House of Commons, which has 650 elected members, compared to the House of Lords, which has 90 members appointed via peerage (a system of titles for noblemen).\n\nHouse of Lords\n\nToday, the two houses of Parliament\u2014the House of Lords and the House of Commons\u2014meet in the Palace of Westminster in London, and are the only body in the United Kingdom\u2019s constitutional monarchy government with the authority to create legislation and make laws.\n\nThe current monarch, King Charles III, still serves a ceremonial role as head of state, and the country\u2019s executive branch is headed by the Prime Minister.\n\nWhile the House of Lords can debate all bills that don\u2019t deal directly with financial matters for the country, it is the House of Commons that holds the ultimate sway when it comes to whether legislation ultimately becomes law.\n\nHowever, the House of Lords does play a role in government accountability, through its questioning of cabinet ministers and the formation of special committees to address important matters of state. Its members are now mostly appointees, not peers who inherit their seats in the House of Lords.\n\nHouse of Commons\n\nToday, all legislation must be approved by the House of Commons in order for it to become law. The House of Commons also controls taxation and the government\u2019s purse strings.\n\nThe public in the United Kingdom elects each of the 650 members of the House of Commons. And in a system somewhat different from that of the United States, government ministers (including the Prime Minister) must regularly answer questions in the House of Commons.\n\nSources\n\nThe Birth of English Parliament.

Although it is technically the lower house, the House of Commons is predominant over the House of Lords , and the name \u201cParliament\u201d is often used to refer to the House of Commons alone.\n\nappeals to political theorists, enables every individual or group to move round the centre, adopting various shades of pink according as the weather changes.\u2026A chamber formed on the lines of the House of Commons should not be big enough to contain all its members at once without overcrowding, and there should be no question of every member having a separate seat reserved for him. If the House is big enough for all its members, nine-tenths of its debates will be conducted in the depressing atmosphere of an almost empty or half-empty Chamber.\u2026[T]here should be on great occasions a sense of crowd and urgency.\n\nDespite its large membership, the chamber of the House of Commons seats only 427 persons. After it was destroyed by a German bomb during World War II , there was considerable discussion about enlarging the chamber and replacing its traditional rectangular structure with a semicircular design. Among those who argued against this proposal was Winston Churchill , who maintained that a semicircular chamber\n\nThe membership of the House of Commons stood at 658 from 1801\u2014when Great Britain and Ireland were united by the Act of Union to form the United Kingdom\u2014until 1885, when it was increased to 670. In 1918 it was increased to 707. It was also changed under subsequent acts. At the general election in May 2010, 650 members were returned\u2014533 from England, 59 from Scotland, 40 from Wales, and 18 from Northern Ireland . Each constituency returns a single member.\n\nThe House of Lords was initially the more powerful of the two houses, but over the centuries its powers gradually diminished . By the late 17th century, the House of Commons had gained the sole right to initiate taxation measures. The House of Lords retained its veto power over bills passed by the Commons, however, and in 1832 the only recourse of the Liberal Party government was to threaten to flood the House of Lords with new Liberal peers in order to prevent it from rejecting that government\u2019s Reform Bill . Eighty years later the same threat was used, again by a Liberal government, to compel the Lords to approve the Parliament Act of 1911 , which enabled a majority of the House of Commons to override the Lords\u2019 rejection of a bill. Under this act, the House of Lords lost the power to delay legislation passed by the Commons for the raising and spending of revenue; it also lost the power to delay other legislation for a period beyond two years (reduced in 1949 to one year). The act also reduced the maximum duration of a parliamentary session to five years.\n\nThe origins of the House of Commons date from the second half of the 13th century, when landholders and other property owners in the counties and towns began sending representatives to Parliament to present grievances and petitions to the king and to accept commitments to the payment of taxes. In the 14th century the knights and burgesses chosen as representatives (i.e., the commons) began sitting in a separate chamber, or \u201chouse,\u201d from that used by the nobles and high clergy (i.e., the lords).\n\nFunctions and operation\n\nLearn about the history and traditions of the House of Commons Chamber, also the functions of its members See all videos for this article\n\nThe House of Commons is the effective legislative authority in Great Britain. It alone has the right to impose taxes and to vote money to, or withhold it from, the various public departments and services. The House of Lords has only infrequently held up major legislation passed by the Commons, and the British sovereign almost automatically provides the Royal Assent to any bill passed. Indeed, the last bill to be rejected by a monarch was the Scottish Militia Bill of 1707, which was vetoed by Queen Anne. Acts of Parliament are not subject to judicial review.\n\nThe passage of legislation is the House of Commons\u2019 primary function. Almost all legislation proceeds from the majority party in the Commons, which forms the government and the cabinet; the latter is composed of senior ministers chosen by, and belonging to the party of, the prime minister, nearly all of whom serve in the House of Commons. The government\u2019s main work in the Commons is to implement the legislative program on which it fought and won the last general election.\n\nAt the beginning of each new session of Parliament, the House elects from its members the speaker, who presides over and regulates debates and rules on points of order and members\u2019 conduct. The speaker does not participate in debates and votes only in order to break a tie, a case that compels the speaker to vote in favour of the status quo. The calling of members to speak in debate is entirely in the speaker\u2019s hands, the main concern being to ensure that a variety of points of view is heard. By a convention of the constitution not established until the 20th century, the prime minister is always a member of the House of Commons, instead of a member of either house. The government party appoints the leader of the House of Commons, who manages the party\u2019s legislative program. Except for occasional independents, members of both the government and opposition parties are under the control of party management within the Commons, whose discipline\u2014particularly over voting\u2014is exercised by members called \u201cwhips.\u201d\n\nThe tradition that a bill must be read three times in the Commons (and also in the Lords) before it can be voted on is based on the need to allow members adequate time to investigate the principles on which the bill is based and the details of its provisions. The first reading is purely formal, but the second reading provides the occasion for debate on the principles involved. The bill then goes into committee, where it is examined clause by clause. Most bills are sent to standing committees, each of which deals with bills belonging to a particular range of topics, with the committees reflecting in their makeup the respective strength of parties in the House. Having examined the bill, the committee then reports back to the House, and after further amendments may have been proposed in the course of more debate, the bill is read a third time and is then voted on. In addition to bills proposed by the government, a limited number of bills sponsored by individual members are considered by the House each session.\n\nBeginning in 1999, power over a number of matters\u2014including health, education, housing, transportation, the environment, and agriculture\u2014was devolved from the British Parliament to the newly established Scottish Parliament, National Assembly of Wales, and (somewhat later) Northern Ireland Assembly. That reallocation of legislative responsibilities raised the issue of whether MPs from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland should continue to vote on measures directed at England only. This so-called West Lothian question (so named because it was first posed in 1977 by the anti-devolutionist MP from West Lothian, Tam Dalyell) was addressed in 2015 by controversial legislation that established a new set of procedures known as English Votes for English Laws (EVEL). New stages were introduced into the standard lawmaking procedure during which legislation that was determined to affect England only was to be considered and voted upon by MPs from English constituencies (who were effectively granted veto power) before moving on to consideration by the House of Commons as a whole. (Similarly, legislation aimed at England and Wales only was to be addressed first by English and Welsh MPs only.) When it was not clear whether a measure was an England-only matter, the speaker of the House of Commons was tasked with making that determination.\n\nAside from passing legislation, the most important business of the full House is the question period, which is held on a regular basis. During this period, members can require government ministers to answer questions regarding their departments; it thus provides the opposition with an opportunity to attack government policy and to raise issues on which the government may be thought to have been negligent. It also generates regular policy debates between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. These exchanges have been made more important by their public broadcast, first by radio in 1978, and then by television in 1989.\n\nMembers of the House of Commons must be 18 years of age or older. Peers of England, Scotland, or the United Kingdom may not be elected to the House of Commons, though Irish peers may be. Certain clergy, judicial officers, members of the armed forces, police officers, and civil servants are also ineligible for election. Women became eligible under an act of 1918. Members were paid beginning in 1911."}, {"url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "page_content": "Colours show the winning party, as shown in the main table of results\n\n\u2020 excluding the Speaker\n\n\u2021 owing to electoral boundaries changing, this figure is notional\n\nComposition of the House of Commons after the election\n\nThe 2010 United Kingdom General Election was an election held on 6 May 2010 to elect 650 members to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom.

This is the first time this has happened since 1974.\n\nThe Conservative Party won 307 out of the 650 seats available making them the largest party in the House of Commons. A coalition was then formed between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats who together had enough seats for a majority. This is the first coalition government in the United Kingdom since World War II.\n\nThe Leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron became Prime Minister of the United Kigdom on 11 May 2010 and the leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg became the Deputy Prime Minister. Before the election, the Leader of the Labour Party Gordon Brown was the Prime Minister.\n\nThis was the first British general election where the leaders of the three main parties took part together in a series of debates for television. The first debate was shown on ITV and was moderated by Alastair Stewart. It was on the subject of domestic affairs and polls taken after the debate showed that most people thought Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg had done the best and the Liberal Democrats then saw a large rise in support in opinion polls, even beating Labour for second place behind the Conservatives.\n\nThe second debate, on the subject of Foreign Affairs was shown on Sky News and was moderated by Adam Boulton. Polls after this debate showed that Nick Clegg and David Cameron had done best with Gordon Brown slightly behind. The third and final debate was shown on BBC One and was moderated by David Dimbleby. It was on the subject of the economy and taxes and most opinion polls indicated that David Cameron had performed the best out of the three leaders.\n\nThe Conservative Party gained support from the following newspapers: the Daily Express, the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Daily Telegraph, the Times, the Daily Star, the Evening Standard, the Financial Times, Sunday Express, the Mail on Sunday, the News of the World, the Sunday Telegraph and the Sunday Times. The Liberal Democrats were supported by: the Guardian, the Observer and the Independent. Only the Daily Mirror and the Sunday Mirror supported the Labour Party and the People newspaper favoured a coalition.\n\nThis election saw the Conservative Party return to government for the first time since 1997 and also saw the Liberal Democrats get their first ever representation in government. Peter Robinson, the First Minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party unexpectedly lost his seat to the Alliance Party. The Green Party of England and Wales gained its first ever seat in the House of Commons and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland gained its first seat in the House of Commons since 1974.

He stood as a parliamentary candidate in Richmond, Surrey when he was just 25, and a year later contested Surrey West in the European election. His sister, Valerie Vaz, was at the time the Deputy Leader of the London Borough of Ealing, the first Black woman to hold the post.\n\nLord David Pitt\n\nLord Pitt of Hampstead, now deceased was the longest serving Black Parliamentarian, having been granted a life peerage in 1975. Born in Grenada, he came to Britain in 1933 to study medicine at Edinburgh University. His achievements in his two chosen careers of medicine and politics were considerable. In 1943, while practicing medicine in Trinidad and Tobago, he was founder member and leader of the Westindian National Party.\n\nUpon his return to live in Britain in 1947 he served as a Member of London County Council and a Chairperson of the Greater London Council and, from 1985-88, as President of the British Medical Association. He was Deputy Chairman of the Community Relations Commission from 1968-1977, and Chairman in 1977. Notably, Pitt was a member of black peoples\u2019 and anti-discriminations organisations such as the Legue of Coloured Peoples and the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination which he chaired in 1965.\n\nAs a prominent member of the House of Lords, inner city issues were among his major concerns. He was Chairperson of the Shelter National Campaign for the Homeless; Chairperson of the Race Equality Unit of the Institute of Social Work; President of the Open Door Counseling Service for the Youth of North London; President of the African-Caribbean Medical Society and Co-Chairperson of the Urban Trust, which provided pump-priming finance for projects in inner city areas."}, {"url": "https://www.politics.co.uk/reference/elections/", "page_content": "Overview\n\nThe House of Commons is made up of 650 elected Members of Parliament, known as MPs. Each Member of Parliament represents a specific geographic area within the United Kingdom. These areas are known as Parliamentary constituencies.\n\nParliamentary Constituencies\n\nIn 2017, the average constituency was comprised of 56,000 voters in Wales, 68,300 voters in Northern Ireland, 67,200 voters in Scotland, and 72,200 votes in England. The largest constituency by population was the Isle of Wight (110,683).\n\nThe Boundary Commission is currently working on proposals to better standardise the electoral numbers within the UK\u2019s 650 constituencies.\n\nBy area, the largest constituency is Ross, Skye and Lochaber in North West Scotland (918,319 hectares). The smallest by area is Islington North in London (727 hectares).\n\nWithin each constituency, Members of Parliament are elected by the first-past-the-post system, which is also known as the plural majority system. Simply put, this means the candidate with the highest number of votes wins.\n\nWho can stand for election\n\nAnyone over the age of 18, who is a British, Irish or Commonwealth citizen can stand for election to Parliament. The only exceptions are Peers, Bishops, undischarged bankrupts, prisoners and certain officeholders including judges, military personnel, police officers and other civil servants (persons holding offices of profit under the Crown).\n\nPeople convicted of certain corruption offences and members of non-Commonwealth legislatures may not stand.\n\nElection Cycles\n\nParliamentary elections must be held at least every five years. Unless they have lost a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons, the date for post war British elections within that period has typically been chosen by the Prime Minister. The sitting Prime Minister asks the Monarch to dissolve Parliament.\n\nThis convention was briefly interrupted by the introduction of the Fixed Term Parliament\u2019s Act in 2010, albeit in both 2017 and 2019, the Parliament\u2019s did not last the planed five year term. This has led to the Fixed Term Parliament\u2019s Act coming under review.\n\nThe word \u2018Parliament\u2019 is used to refer to the time between two general elections.\n\nEach Parliament is made up of Sessions, which normally last about a year from November to October. A Session runs from the State Opening of Parliament (the Queen\u2019s Speech) until prorogation or dissolution.\n\nAfter an election, the Monarch opens Parliament in the normal way through the State Opening of Parliament. Typically, the first Session after an election is normally longer than a year, running through to the October of the following year.\n\nElection Length\n\nThere are certain rules governing the timetable for elections themselves.\n\nA session of Parliament is prorogued on the day scheduled and dissolution normally follows on the same day, although it does not have to. It is normally accompanied by the proclamation calling a new Parliament. The election must normally then take place 17 days after this proclamation (not including weekends and public or bank holidays).\n\nElection campaigns \u2013 the time between dissolution and the election \u2013 normally last about three or four weeks.\n\nWhat is a by-election\n\nIf a Member of Parliament resigns or dies, then a by-election is held to elect a replacement in that constituency.\n\nThe date for the by-election is chosen by the Government but it is announced by the Speaker of House of Commons."}, {"url": "https://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/explainers/what-does-house-lords-do", "page_content": "The House of Lords has three main functions: making laws, investigating public policy, and holding the government to account. The House of Lords is the less powerful partner in the Westminster parliamentary system: unlike the House of Commons, it cannot remove the government from office, and it can only delay, rather than veto, most bills.\n\nThe House of Lords once was more powerful than the House of Commons. Up to the passing of the Parliament Act 1911, the House of Lords held the power to veto bills passed by the Commons. The 1911 Act saw this power reduced to the delaying power the Lords has today\u2014 this was one of the most radical reforms to the House of Lords in its history.\n\nMembers of the House of Lords spend a lot of their time considering draft government bills before they become law. However, any proposed amendments to legislation must also be agreed by the Commons. Its primary function is therefore as a \u2018revising\u2019 chamber, asking the Commons to reconsider its plans.\n\nThrough the work of parliamentary select committees, peers investigate public policy covering a wide range of public policy, from justice and home affairs, to the long-term sustainability of the NHS. Committees produce reports which can often directly or indirectly influence the formulation of government policy.\n\nHolding the government to account is another function of the Lords. During question time and debates in the chamber members put questions to government ministers who must respond.\n\nIt is very rare for peers to try to overrule legislation passed by the House of Commons as a whole. Under the Salisbury Convention the House of Lords does not try to block bills that were promised in the governing party\u2019s manifesto, and rarely blocks any bill in its entirety. In general, the unelected House of Lords defers to the Commons\u2019 democratic mandate, but makes proposals for MPs to think again.\n\nAs it does not hold a majority, the government is defeated in the House of Lords quite often, generally on amendments to bills. Constitution Unit research shows that in recent years just under half of defeats have gone on to be accepted by the House of Commons, leaving a lasting impact on policy. A high-profile example under the Labour government occurred in 2006, when the House of Lords repeatedly voted against compulsory ID cards. The government chose to delay the implementation of ID cards until after the 2010 election. That election resulted in a Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, which went on to scrap ID cards. This episode was highly adversarial, but more commonly members of the Lords propose changes which the government accepts, in order to improve the substance of legislation.\n\nThe House of Lords is equipped to perform this \u2018revising\u2019 role due to the wide range of expertise and experiences of its members, and its independence of thought\u2014a large proportion of its members have no political affiliation. Some members are former politicians, while others are expert in business, education, science, and other public policy areas. Of the around 800 members, most have been appointed as 'life peers' by the Queen on advice of consecutive Prime Minsters; the rest comprise 92 hereditary peers and 26 Church of England Archbishops and Bishops.\n\nMany call for reform of the Lords, primarily due to it not being elected by popular vote. There are many options for reform but history demonstrates how tricky reform is. It is widely argued that one of the most urgent reforms needed is to contain the ballooning size of the Lords by restricting the Prime Minister\u2019s power to appoint new peers.\n\nRelated explainers:\n\nWhat are constitutional conventions?\n\nFurther reading:"}, {"url": "https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/house-of-commons", "page_content": "The House of Commons of Parliament Building, Ottawa. Photo taken on: August 23rd, 2011 (\u00a9 Wangkun Jia | Dreamstime)\n\nRole of the House of Commons\n\nThe House of Commons is the elected lower house of Parliament. It consists of a Speaker (traditionally chosen from the party in power but now elected from the House by secret ballot), the prime minister and his or her Cabinet, members of the governing party, members of the opposition parties and the Official Opposition's shadow government, and backbenchers. There are sometimes a few independent members. The 338 members of the House (called Members of Parliament, or MPs) are elected in single-member constituency elections or by-elections.\n\nUnder the Constitution Act 1867, the Queen and the Governor General and the Queen's ministers and other public servants, not the House of Commons, govern Canada. Those ministers, however, are responsible to the House (see Responsible Government). The House, often incorrectly referred to as Parliament, is important constitutionally because no new statutes may be created except in response to bills that have been passed by the House. It is important politically because, unlike the Senate or upper house, it is an independent, elected body. Ministers are responsible to the House, not to the Senate.\n\nNon-financial bills may be introduced in the Senate as well as in the House, but under the Constitution Act, both taxation bills and appropriation bills must have passed the House before going to the Senate. Although private members may introduce taxation bills, under the Act (s54), only the Crown may initiate spending (supply) business.\n\nThe House\u2019s constitutional function is to maintain a government for a reasonable time. To defeat one government after another in rapid succession would be anarchistic, a point which becomes highly relevant when no party wins a majority, as happened in six of the nine elections between 1957 and 1979, and again in the successive elections of 2004 and 2006. The political function of the House is to foster government acceptable to the people, and it has the power to insist that ministers account for their conduct and their bills and policies.\n\nQuestion Period and Accountability\n\nQuestions may be written down and placed on the Order Paper to receive a printed reply but during oral Question Period (45 minutes daily) ministers may be questioned directly (see Parliamentary Procedures). Usually, Opposition MPs ask the questions.\n\nThe House can bring down a government. Elections were held after the House defeated minority governments in 1963, 1974, 1979 and 2005. In recent years, the controversy over ministerial responsibility and the growth of executive power (sometimes referred to as \"Cabinet dictatorship\" or \"concentration of power in the hands of the Prime Minister's Office\") has generated considerable debate over the role, function and relevance of the House. The extent to which individual ministers should be held accountable for the actions of civil servants in their departments is also a subject of much debate in the highly partisan atmosphere that pervades the House of Commons.\n\nIn Canada, Parliament is expected to serve as an auditor of executive government, examining bills, policies and conduct. House Committees have become increasingly useful for these purposes. The role of the media in covering parliamentary debate and generating public opinion is of critical importance. The decision of the House to publish its debates in the form of a bilingual Hansard and, more recently, to allow continuous television coverage when the House is in session (on the publicly supported Cable Public Affairs Channel, or CPAC) were prompted in part by dissatisfaction with the news media.\n\nOpposition Parties\n\nIn order for a party to be recognized in the House, it must have 12 or more Members of Parliament. Such recognition entitles the party to committee assignments, research support and being called upon by the Speaker more frequently to ask questions of the government. Since 1974, election ballots have shown the candidates' party allegiances, if any, to voters. Members sometimes \"cross the floor\" to another party or leave their party, by choice, or after being removed from caucus by their leader, and will sit as independents. This does not happen often.\n\nThe Opposition is allotted up to twenty-five days in three supply periods to determine the subject of debate in the House. Supply periods occur when the government is seeking passage of spending bills (see Budgetary Process). The Opposition may also make motions to discuss an urgent, unexpected matter. The debate on the Speech from the Throne and the debate on the budget are general debates.\n\nParliamentary Privilege\n\nAt the beginning of each Parliament, the privileges of the House of Commons are confirmed by the governor general. This stems from the tradition at Westminster, where it was found that if the House was to participate effectively it had to have certain privileges and certain exemptions from ordinary law. For a long time, one of the foremost privileges at Westminster was that its members could not be imprisoned for debt. In Canada, members have the right to speak freely \u2014 without being liable to prosecution in the courts \u2014 in proceedings of the House and its committees. MPs cannot say anything they please; the House has a responsibility to control its members and to protect ordinary citizens from vilification.\n\nMPs may be accused of contempt and of misleading the House. In 1982, the Speaker considered a breach-of-privilege complaint against the minister of justice. The House may admonish or censure offenders and is empowered to imprison them for the balance of the session. Genuine questions of privilege and contempt are serious but very rare; however, many members use points of privilege, which take precedence over most other business, to get the floor merely to voice complaints or to make corrections.\n\nRole of the Speaker\n\nAll speeches in the House are addressed to the Speaker, although direct exchanges often break out in the heat of debate. Private members are referred to by the name of their constituencies (i.e., \"the Honourable Member for Peace River\") and ministers by office (i.e., \"the Honourable the Minister of Finance\"). The House does not permit members to use unparliamentary language because it fosters bitterness and reflects on the honour of the House but, in recent years, the Speaker has been under increasing pressure to keep things civilized. Some expressions deemed unparliamentary include \"sick animal,\" \"pompous ass,\" \"lies,\" \"Nazi\" and \"stinker.\" In 1971, A Conservative MP alleged that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau told him to f--- off, but Trudeau famously denied swearing in the House, claiming he said \u201cfuddle duddle.\u201d And in 1985, Conservative MP John Crosbie caused an uproar after telling Liberal MP Sheila Copps, \u201cQuiet down, baby.\"\n\nThe Speaker is the chief officer of the House and his election is the prime order of business when the House reassembles after a general election. The Speaker decides who has the floor, applies the rules of procedure, makes rulings, and manages the administration of the House and its employees. He must be impartial and does not participate in debates and will only vote when there is a tie. There have been unsuccessful attempts to make the position permanent \u2014 as it is at Westminster. The Deputy Speaker occupies the Speaker's chair if he is absent and chairs the committee of the whole. The Clerk of the House sits at a table in front of the Speaker, dressed in a black robe, and he and the other table officers supply the Speaker with advice and information.\n\nWhen the first parliaments were held at Westminster, the king sent a royal sergeant-at-arms, bearing a royal mace, to the House of Commons to show that the House was under the king's protection and was not to be threatened. In Ottawa, the sergeant-at-arms occupies a special chair in the centre aisle and he leads the procession when the Speaker enters the chamber or proceeds to the Senate chamber for speeches from the throne, royal assents and prorogations. The sergeant-at-arms carries the mace, a symbol of the authority of the House vested in the Speaker, and places it on the table when the Speaker takes his seat.\n\nThe Commons Chamber\n\nThe House of Commons meets in the Commons chamber at the west end of the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings. The main doors of the chamber are at the south end \u2014 this is where the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod raps when he comes to summon the Commons to the Senate chamber. There is a telescoping brass rail known as the Bar at the foot of the centre aisle of the chamber, just inside the main doors, which can be extended across the aisle. One of its original functions at Westminster was to keep strangers from mingling and perhaps voting with the members. Occasionally, strangers have been summoned to appear at the Bar of the House to be questioned or censured but otherwise the public and press do not go into the chamber and view proceedings instead from the galleries above.\n\nEvery member has an assigned seat in the chamber and must be in his place to speak and vote in the House. There are five rows of desks down each of the long sides of the room; these two banks of desks face each other across a wide centre aisle, with the Government on one side and the Opposition on the other. The Speaker's chair is at the north end of the centre aisle. This arrangement supposedly originated in the days when the English House met in St Stephen's Chapel, and it suits the adversarial nature of Canada\u2019s responsible government system.\n\nThe prime minister occupies the 13th place in the front row on the west side, while the leader of the Opposition sits directly opposite. The other ministers are grouped in a block of seats around the prime minister. The leader of the Opposition also has key followers around him. Former ministers \u2014 styled \"the Honourable\" as members of the Privy Council, a title they retain for life \u2014 are given seats in the front rows, at either the north or south end. The leader of each party, through the Party Whip, fixes the party seating plan \u2014 invariably by class (year of first election) and alphabetically within classes.\n\nThe Commons convenes Monday through Friday and normally adjourns at 6:30 p.m, except for Fridays. Emergency debates, though, can run past midnight. In 1913, before there was a fixed time for adjournment, two different sittings extended throughout an entire week. A record was set in 1982, during the \"long-bell sitting,\" which began on 2 March and did not end until 17 March. The issue was the Opposition's concern with the Energy Security Bill proposed by the Trudeau government.\n\n\u00a9 Library of Parliament.\n\nA Growing Chamber\n\nIn 2011, the House of Commons passed a bill to expand the chamber by 30 seats in time for the 2015 election. It was supported by the majority Conservative government \u2014 which introduced the bill to better represent the country\u2019s fastest growing provinces \u2014 but opposed by the Liberals and New Democratic Party. The NDP was against giving Quebec more seats and the Liberals wanted to keep the same number of seats but reorganize the distribution more equitably. The change will expand the Commons to 338 seats, with Ontario getting 15 new MPs and BC and Alberta getting six more each. Qu\u00e9bec will also get three more, although the province is already slightly overrepresented. It is expected to cost more than $34-million.\n\nDid you know? Enfranchised women in Canada first gained the right to stand for theHouse of Commons on 7 July 1919 (see Women\u2019s Suffrage in Canada). In the 1921 general federal election, Agnes Campbell Macphail became the first woman elected to Parliament. She would remain the only female MP in the House of Commons until Martha Louise Black was elected in the 1935 federal general election.\n\nSummons and Prorogation\n\nSessions of Parliament begin with a summons and end with prorogation (suspension), both of which are issued by the governor general at the government\u2019s request. Minority parliaments recently have lasted only one or two sessions. Between 1867 and 1938, the annual sessions lasted only a few months; now they normally run a full year, with three long adjournments. The main purpose of prorogation is to wipe clean the Order Paper of old or existing business, and to set a new legislative agenda. All business unfinished at the end of a session\u2014unanswered questions and all orders relating to bills and motions \u2014 die on the Order Paper.\n\nProrogation has become a heated political issue in recent years. Controversy erupted in 2008 when Prime Minister Stephen Harper asked Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean to prorogue Parliament shortly before a confidence vote that could have defeated his minority Conservative government and replaced it with a coalition NDP-Liberal regime supported by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Amid intense public and media scrutiny, Jean agreed to Harper's request, after consulting constitutional experts. The Conservative government survived.\n\nIn 2009 Harper again asked the governor general to prorogue Parliament for two months, arguing that his government needed to consult with Canadians and businesses as it dealt with economic issues. The move, however, was widely criticized as a tactic allowing the government time to gain a majority on Senate committees. It was also seen as a strategic move to avoid investigations into allegations that the government had ignored warnings about the torture of detainees in the Afghanistan war.\n\nThe 2009 episode led to a broader debate about whether or not governments were using prorogation as a political tool to further their own causes.\n\nCentre Block Renovation\n\nIn 2019, Parliament Hill\u2019s Centre Block closed its doors for a major renovation that is expected to last at least a decade. The project to restore, upgrade and modernize the Centre Block includes the House of Commons and Senate chambers, as well as the Peace Tower, the Library of Parliament, and offices for MPs and party leaders. While the building will be closed to visitors during the construction, the Hill \u2013 including the Great Lawn - remains open and Parliament continues to function. MPs are operating out of a temporary House of Commons located in the West Block and the Senate is working out of temporary chambers in the Senate of Canada Building (formerly named the Government Conference Centre)."}, {"url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49826655", "page_content": "The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday.\n\nThese national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years.\n\nBut this would be the third since 2015.\n\nWhat is this election for?\n\nA total of 650 people will be chosen as members of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies.\n\nSkip members of Parliament (MPs) Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons.

Mrs Thatcher was in office, but had yet to consolidate her grip on power. Labour was high in the opinion polls. There was a real possibility that, come the election, the Labour party would be led by Tony Benn. The rightwing press was working itself into a frenzy at the prospect. \"No longer if, but when,\" screamed a Daily Mail headline over a full-page picture of Mr Benn. To cap it all, the news that the US was planning to install cruise missiles in its British bases had given the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament a new lease of life. \"A good subject for a novel,\" said one of my companions.\n\nBy the time A Very British Coup was published, in 1982, the political climate was even more propitious. Prompted by the imminent arrival of cruise missiles, CND demonstrations were attracting crowds in excess of 200,000. The establishment was getting so twitchy that, as we later learned, Michael Heseltine had set up a special unit in the Ministry of Defence to counter the impact of CND.\n\nThe US was getting twitchy too. When A Very British Coup was published I was editor of the political weekly Tribune, and we were selling the book by mail order through the paper. A few days after the first advert appeared we were intrigued to receive an order from the US embassy. We duly dispatched a copy and waited to see what would happen next. We did not have to wait long. An invitation arrived to lunch with the minister, the most important man at the embassy after the ambassador. He even sent his bullet-proof Cadillac to Tribune's modest headquarters in Gray's Inn Road to convey me to his mansion in Kensington.\n\nAt first I assumed that I was one of a number of guests, but no: there was just the minister, two of his colleagues, an Asian butler and myself.\n\n\"Why are you interested in a minnow like me?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I reckon,\" he drawled, \"that you are among the top 1,000 opinion formers in the country.\"\n\n\"Well, I must be about number 999.\"\n\n\"The other 999 have been here too.\"\n\nA year or two later I received from an anonymous source an envelope posted in Brussels. It contained an internal US state department memorandum addressed to US diplomats in London listing a number of questions they were to put to \"authorised contacts\" in London regarding the balance of power within the Labour party and opinion regarding the US bases in general and the impending arrival of cruise missiles in particular. Although, in retrospect, we can see they had no cause for concern, there is no doubt that alarm bells were ringing in Washington.\n\nA Very British Coup attracted attention elsewhere too. It was helpfully denounced in the correspondence columns of the Times, and as a result sales in Hatchards of Piccadilly almost matched those at the leftwing bookshop Collets. (When it comes to selling books, a high-profile denunciation is worth half a dozen friendly reviews and I have always done my best to organise one).\n\nThereafter interest might have faded, but for events conspiring to make it topical. In August 1985 the Observer revealed that an MI5 officer, Brigadier Ronnie Stoneham, was to be found in room 105 at Broadcasting House. His job? Stamping upturned Christmas trees on the personnel files of BBC employees he deemed to be unsuitable for promotion. Students of A Very British Coup will know that my head of MI5, Sir Peregrine Craddock, was also vetting BBC employees. What's more, he also had a spy on the general council of CND - and in due course the MI5 defector Cathy Massiter revealed that there had indeed been such a spy. His name was Harry Newton.\n\nFinally, in 1987 Peter Wright, a retired MI5 officer, caused a sensationwith his claim that he and a group of MI5 colleagues had plotted to undermine the Wilson government. Suddenly the possibility that the British establishment might conspire with its friends across the Atlantic to destabilise the elected government could no longer be dismissed as leftwing paranoia.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. In due course the novel was translated into a brilliant television series. Harry Perkins, my prime minister, was brought to life by the wonderful actor Ray McAnally, who tragically died not long afterwards. The TV series was shown in more than 30 countries and showered with Bafta and Emmy awards. It was a particularly big hit in the US.\n\nCould it happen today? No, I am afraid not. The political landscape has changed beyond recognition. Cruise missiles are long gone. MI5 has been cleared of dead wood such as Peter Wright and his friends. A Labour government is in power - and on excellent terms with Washington.\n\n\u00b7 Chris Mullin is a former Foreign Office minister.

Please wait...\n\nCover of A View From The Foothills\n\nIf A socialist prime minister was ever elected the establishment would do everything it could to prevent any real change. That was the sensible premise of A Very British Coup, the novel by Sunderland Labour MP Chris Mullin.\n\nIt reflected what much of the left in the Labour Party thought about the world in the 1980s. They were pro-peace, pro-ordinary people and suspicious of the security services and the press.\n\nBut it also contained the conviction that things had to be done for, not by ordinary people.\n\nThe novel ends with the prime minister resigning after a set up tabloid scandal. As it turned out, no such \u201ccoup\u201d was ever needed. The left\u2019s desire to \u201cmake a difference\u201d by being in power meant that eventually they went along with, and indeed promoted, the things they previously despised.\n\nAnd \u201cmaking a difference\u201d \u2013 or, more precisely, failing to but telling yourself that the latest shoddy comprise is OK \u2013 is the central thread of Chris Mullin\u2019s recently published diaries, A View from the Foothills.\n\nMullin once wrote a guide on how to deselect your MP. Now he has written a lengthy book showing why you would want to.\n\nHe is by no means the worst of them and the diaries are informative and funny.\n\nThe usual gossip is there and much of it is entertaining. For instance, the Queen Mother leaning over to Neil Kinnock at a state banquet, saying, \u201cMay I say something in absolute confidence?\u201d and whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t trust the Germans.\u201d\n\nBut the politics are infuriating. Mullin\u2019s half-hearted worries, but non-rebellion, over the anti-terror laws are simply saddening to read \u2013 particularly from the author of An Error Of Judgement, a book that was central to the release of the Birmingham Six, jailed for 15 years after being wrongly convicted for an IRA bombing.\n\nCold\n\nAs a former editor of the Labour magazine Tribune, when what it said still mattered, and a member of the Socialist Campaign Group, he is left cold by \u201cNew Labour claptrap about strategies, visions, challenges and opportunities\u201d.\n\nForced to attend an event called \u201cListening to Old People,\u201d he writes it off as \u201ca classic New Labour wheeze designed to create the illusion of consultation,\u201d and sits \u201cquietly at the back, praying no one would spot me\u201d.\n\nBlair is annoyingly referred to throughout as \u201cThe Man\u201d, occasionally as \u201cOur Great Leader\u201d. Mullin both admires and sees through him.\n\nWhen Mullin is out of favour, he wants to be in, and when he is in, he wants to be out. He becomes what he calls \u201cunder-secretary for folding deckchairs\u201d in John Prescott\u2019s department of the environment.\n\nWith a predictable turn, the civil servants are unhelpful and the MPs behave as if they are in a public school dormitory \u2013 which is, of course, where most of them, including Mullin, were educated.\n\nHe recalls his job as involving little more than having to laugh at John Prescott\u2019s jokes \u2013 but in fact Mullin was responsible for privatising air traffic control.\n\nBlair later makes him Africa minister. Mullin says he realised, \u201cthat there are many good men in Africa. It is a question of giving them a helping hand.\u201d Bless.\n\nDespite his irritation with New Labour, much of his diary is in reality New Labour guff. \u201cThere are so many good things happening in Sunderland,\u201d he writes. \u201cA new shopping complex. A state of the art bus station. The metro on its way.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, many of his constituents don\u2019t seem to appreciate just how much \u201cbetter\u201d things are under Labour.\n\nHis surgeries provide him with misery as the damaged and the distraught come to him for help.\n\nHe is upset for the worthy asylum seeker he can do absolutely nothing to help, while at the same time backing more draconian attacks on immigrants.\n\nMullin is saddened that factories are closing in Sunderland but can do nothing to save them. And he hates the firefighters\u2019 strike with vitriol because they might encourage others to make demands on the government.\n\nTo his credit he was an opponent of the war in Iraq \u2013 just \u2013 and he did vote against it.\n\nBut the moral equivalence and the wringing of hands are painful. Describing Blair\u2019s defence of the invasion, he writes, \u201cThe Man\u2019s performance was flawless. He made his case calmly and without exaggeration. He met every argument head on and treated his critics with respect.\u201d\n\nAdding, \u201cI want The Man to be right. In the end that would be best for all of us.\u201d\n\nHis belief that only with influence can something be done \u2013 but that next to nothing can actually be done \u2013 is not a matter for rage but for a resigned smugness.\n\nThere is one exception. Mullin takes leylandii \u2013 a type of fast growing hedge that he wants banned \u2013 very seriously.\n\nBy the end of the book I\u2019d become in favour of planting leylandii in every garden in the land.\n\nMullin ultimately achieved his victory with the imposition of height restrictions on the hedges as a successful amendment to the anti-social behaviour bill.\n\nAh, so he did make a difference after all.\n\nA View From The Foothills\n\nby Chris Mullin\n\nProfile Books, \u00a320\n\nGo to Bookmarks, the socialist bookshop \u00bb www.bookmarksbookshop.co.uk"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/mar/13/chris-mullin-quotes", "page_content": "On becoming a junior minister in the environment department: \"It is something of a humiliation.

I am not a pacifist. I could be persuaded, but I have not been persuaded. I accept that the United Kingdom must play a part in helping to defeat Isil. There are many things we can do, short of bombing. I am not against the use of airpower in support of a just cause. I would have supported the use of airpower in support of any credible ground force. It was right last year to use of airpower to assist the defenders Kobani, on the Turkish border. It was right to use airpower recently in support of the Kurds fighting to recapture Sinjar. It makes makes sense, too, to isolate the Isil strongholds in Raqqa and Mosul and to cut them off from each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are already quite enough people dropping bombs on Syria.\n\nBut there are already quite enough people dropping bombs on Syria and, in the absence of a plan, I remain to be convinced that more are needed. Listening to the prime minister and his colleagues in recently, one has the impression that their main motivation is that they can't bear to be left out. Or that bombing has become a substitute for more effective intervention.\n\nNor should we forget that there are a large number of civilians trapped in the Isil strongholds. At least 200,000 in Raqqa alone. Inevitably, there will be many casualties. Indeed, I would be surprised if the number of civilian dead from allied bombing has not already exceeded the number of victims of the recent atrocity in Paris. It is just that we don't see them and their families on our television screens at night. Indeed, to judge by some of the images on the news bulletins of late, one could be forgiven for thinking that bombing is some kind of video game. The point about bombing is that it looks utterly different from the ground looking up than it does from the sky looking down.\n\nSurely we have learned by now from our experience in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya that, when you take the lid off one of these regimes you unleash the fires of hell.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about precision bombing in recent days. I don't believe a word of it. Casualties of NATO's precision bombing of Belgrade during the last Balkan war included a train packed with civilians, the Chinese consulate, a radio station and, in Kosovo, a convoy of Albanian refugees. And when the Serbian regime finally capitulated and withdrew its tanks and armour from Kosovo it became clear that far fewer had been put out of action than had been claimed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Americans in particular have a shocking record when it comes to inflicting civilian casualties. Why, as recently as October, they bombed a Medicine Sans Frontieres hospital in Kunduz, northern Afghanistan killing at least 30 medical staff and patients. The Kunduz incident was only remarkable in that they owned up immediately; usually they obfuscate. In the first Iraq war they fired two laser guided bombs into the Amiriyah air raid shelter in a suburb of Baghdad, killing more than 400 people. In Afghanistan and Iraq they have bombed hospitals, schools and even wedding parties. Don't talk to me about precision bombing.\n\nOne final point, Mr Speaker. Ministers have repeatedly made the point that the removal of President Assad remains our objective. Were that to happen, I have no doubt that the result would be the disintegration of the few parts of Syria where there is still some sort of functioning government. We should be careful what we wish for.

The late Alan Clark's diaries were turned into TV drama; now, from the Labour side, Chris Mullin's have been adapted for the theatre, with the production currently running in London. They were not an obvious choice.\n\nClark's rampant lechery, his malice towards many supposed political allies, and his devil-may-care flamboyance (he once delivered a frontbench statement while palpably drunk) made his diaries compulsive reading. Mullin, though his diaries are consistently witty and include some very funny stories, is earnest, conscientious and (except towards Peter Mandelson) kindly. He would never write of anyone, as Clark did of Tom King, a senior Tory minister, that \"his balls are very weak\". Nor would he agree with Henry \"Chips\" Channon, a backbench Tory diarist of the 1930s and 40s, that \"the weaknesses of one's friends are more amusing to chronicle than their dignified conduct\". Where Clark punctuates his diaries with tales of seduction, Mullin records his struggles on behalf of asylum-seekers, his compassion for starving Africans, and his progress in extirpating masonic secrecy and MPs' September holidays. But Mullin, as much as Clark, deserves his place in the front rank of political diarists.\n\nThe best of these diarists, while they have a degree of access to the inner circles of power, are nevertheless detached. The diaries of Jock Colville, private secretary to Churchill during the second world war and the 1951-55 administration, are of immense value to historians and absorbing to political obsessives. But the diaries of Charles Moran, Churchill's doctor, provide far more illumination about the great man's opinions of ministerial colleagues. Other great 20th-century diarists such as Channon and Harold Nicolson tell us as much about English high society in the 30s and 40s as they do about Whitehall and Westminster.\n\nNicolson and Clark, it seems, were Mullin's models. Like them, he only briefly reached the lower echelons of government as, in his own self-deprecating description, \"minister for folding deckchairs\". Like them, he is a precise observer and attentive listener who records gestures, postures, tones of voice and turns of phrase (he notes that in his early years of office, Tony Blair was a serial name-dropper, reeling off the monarchs and presidents he had lately met). Like them, his maverick qualities often make his comments surprising. Though firmly on the Labour left, he repeatedly expresses exasperation with \"the benefit culture\" that seduces many of his Sunderland constituents. Indeed, for all his reputation as a man of the people, Mullin delivers harsher verdicts on the greed, idleness and ingratitude of visitors to his weekly surgeries than he does on political colleagues.\n\nMullin covers the entire New Labour era, from Blair's accession in 1994 to the regime's downfall in 2010. The latest volume \u2013 as often happens with political diaries and memoirs, they were not published in chronological order \u2013 covers the period up to the beginning of Mullin's \"four undistinguished years in government\" (his words) in July 1999. Paradoxically, Mullin's influence was probably at its greatest before he entered office. After the vindication of his long campaign to free the Birmingham Six, he is Labour's most admired backbencher, \"a sane leftwinger\" (the Financial Times's description) who, while sceptical of New Labour and its modish jargon, is prepared to give the leadership the benefit of the doubt. He is chosen to second the 1997 Queen's Speech, an honour which he hears about just in time to put on \"my one and only suit\" before he leaves home. Later, he secures the chairmanship of the Home Affairs select committee, which, he tells Blair, he prefers to a junior ministerial position. He tops elections for the parliamentary committee, and wins the Channel 4 award for Commons Questioner of the Year.\n\nYet he is eventually drawn to power in the more conventional sense. Resolved to accept nothing less than minister of state, he settles for the lowest rung, parliamentary under-secretary, only to discover, as the Observer's Andrew Rawnsley put it, that he \"has been buried as effectively as if he had been fitted with concrete overshoes and dropped into the Thames\". His job consists almost entirely of pointless activity and just about his only tangible achievement (at the environment department) is to impose a 10mph speed limit on Lake Windermere. The saddest part of the diaries recounts how, during an interval when he returns to the backbenches, still hoping for something better at ministerial level, he wonders how, in divisions on the Iraq war, he can find \"a loophole through which I can crawl, principles and job prospects intact\". In the end, he rebels on one vote, but troops \"pathetically into the government lobby\" on another. His modest prize is to become under-secretary of state for Africa, the only job that makes him at all happy.\n\nWhen Mullin, after much characteristic dithering, decides to step down as an MP at the 2010 election, he does so out of frustration and boredom. That is the unique value of these diaries: they show, ruefully and entertainingly, the sheer tedium that faces many MPs and junior ministers. Mullin, honest and self-aware, cannot disguise his own unimportance. The other diarists move effortlessly in elite circles: Channon in particular is forever attending London balls and the country-house parties where the big decisions were taken. Beyond politics, they enjoy a hinterland of business, writing and leisure interests. Mullin is too conscientious to deploy his undoubted talents extensively outside parliament. He may dote on his wife and children but he does not, like Clark, collect vintage cars or, like Nicolson, preside over castle gardens.\n\nAfter reading Mullin, one sees why most politicians will do almost anything to attain and hold on to high office. Mullin himself is not much attracted, as a select committee chairman, by overseas junkets; and, as a minister, he eschews the trappings of power, declining a chauffeured car because, he explains, a bus to Westminster passes the front door of his south London home. But he shows, all the same, why so many MPs are tempted, in the graphic phrase, to sink their snouts in the trough."}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/meghan-markle-marriage-prince-harry-chris-mullin-mp-b2337547.html", "page_content": "Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter Stay ahead of the trend in fashion and beyond with our free weekly Lifestyle Edit newsletter Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Mullin\u2019s achievement is arguably greater than that of most, as he was never a major player at Westminster in the first place. His compelling diaries take advantage of his \u201cbeing there\u201d during most of the main political dramas of the past three decades or more. The success of these personal day-to-day records has secured him a later-life career treading the boards at literary festivals \u2013 the political meeting places of today\u2019s middle classes.\n\nHinterland, a series of roughly chronological essays, is just as enjoyable as Mullin\u2019s diaries but perhaps more serious in tone. He chooses to open this memoir with a chapter on his involvement, as a then left-leaning MP and journalist, in Labour\u2019s struggles in the 1980s. As he was a Bennite who later became a Blairite, his nuanced and fair-handed account should be required reading for all those today who bandy about tired clich\u00e9s about this period in Labour\u2019s history.\n\nHere is a convincing portrait of party members \u2013 \u201cthe poor bloody infantry\u201d \u2013 sidelined for decades by Labour\u2019s leaders, complacent trade union bosses and the many MPs who behaved as if they had a seat for life. Mullin is equally clear-eyed about the hysteria and machinations of those who opposed reform, including some on the centre left (who emerge from this account very badly), the security services and the press, who worked in covert concert to smear the principal figures on the left.\n\nThe author concludes, \u201cAlthough the campaign [for democracy inside the Labour Party] was widely portrayed as some sort of Trotskyite conspiracy, it was in reality a popular uprising, a reaction to the disappointments of Labour governments . . . Intolerance was by no means the exclusive preserve of the left.\u201d In a typical Mullin footnote, he still delights in correcting those who accuse him of writing a pamphlet called How to Deselect Your MP. Wrong. He was the author of the carefully worded How to Select or Reselect Your MP, and he is no doubt currently negotiating the film rights to this \u201cgenerally responsible\u201d publication.\n\nRelated\n\nBut what of his \u201chinterland\u201d? Mullin has had an extraordinarily varied life beyond Westminster and here he drops his usual wryly detached style, especially when writing about his lifelong love for south-east Asia. He exudes authentic outrage about the tragedy and waste of the Vietnam War, but also shares an unashamedly tender description of how he met, wooed and wedded his Vietnamese wife, Ngoc.\n\nSubscribe to the Saturday Read View all newsletters Your new guide to the best writing on ideas, politics, books and culture each weekend \u2013 from the New Statesman.

THANK YOU Close\n\nThere are many sharp and funny passages on his life as a novelist (his best-known book, A Very British Coup, is still in print) and on his time as a laid-back junior minister and then as a seemingly more engaged member \u2013 later chair \u2013 of the home affairs select committee. A chapter titled \u201cLoony MP Backs Bomb Gang\u201d, about his fight to free the Birmingham Six, wrongly convicted in 1975 for two pub explosions that killed 21 people, has a noirish quality, as Mullin is led to meetings with the self-confessed real bomber at a remote location in Ireland.\n\nHe attractively underplays his heroism while being comically candid about his many failings. Asked to take a walk-on part as a vicar in a film adaptation of one of his own books (a good bit of casting), he agonises over his lines, only to find most of his performance discarded on the cutting-room floor. We can\u2019t help but wince at his account of being summoned to support Tony Blair at the despatch box in 2003 after a joint visit to a Commonwealth conference in Nigeria. Mullin was too busy \u201csoaking up the atmosphere\u201d in the chamber to realise that Blair had asked him there specifically to provide help with MPs\u2019 questions; he is ruefully honest about how his failure to do so almost certainly marked the beginning of the end of his ministerial career.\n\nOffering his verdict on Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s surprise victory in 2015, he adopts the same mild tone as in his writing about the 1980s. Electing Corbyn was always going to be a \u201chigh-risk strategy\u201d but, Mullin argues, his decisive majority should have secured him at least two years\u2019 grace from his critics. He also gives backing to the increasingly fashionable idea that Labour should enter into an electoral pact with the Greens and the Liberal Democrats if the party is ever to come to power again.\n\nFor all its range and revelation, Hinterland does little to lessen the enigma of Mullin the human being: that baffling but engaging mixture of acuity and self-deprecation, application and apparent insouciance. The chapters on his family and school life offer no conclusive explanation for the unusual confidence of this \u201csickly child\u201d who failed his eleven-plus exam \u2013 \u201ca seminal event\u201d in his life, from which he was saved only by his family\u2019s ability to pay for him to go to a Catholic boarding school. In a rare resort to clich\u00e9, he ascribes most of his achievements in life to good luck.\n\nThe end of Hinterland assumes an elegiac air, with Mullin preparing for retirement from the public stage to tend his beloved walled garden in Northumberland. Don\u2019t believe a word of it. You can\u2019t keep a good politician down, especially not one who writes as well as this.\n\nMelissa Benn\u2019s books include \u201cSchool Wars: the Battle for Britain\u2019s Education\u201d (Verso)\n\nChris Mullin appears at Cambridge Literary Festival, in association with the New Statesman, on 27 November.
