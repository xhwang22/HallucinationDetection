Johnson was born on August 24, 1945, in Elizabeth, New Jersey. She was identified as male at birth. However, young Marsha enjoyed wearing clothing made for girls. After a boy sexually assaulted her, she stopped wearing the clothes she loved and felt most comfortable in. After graduating high school, Marsha moved to New York City with only $15 and a bag of clothes. She began dressing almost exclusively in women\u2019s clothes and adopted the full name Marsha P. Johnson. The \u201cP\u201d stood for \u201cPay It No Mind.\u201d To her, this was a life motto and a response to questions about her gender. Today, historians and former friends of Marsha describe her as a trans woman. During Marsha\u2019s lifetime, the term transgender was not commonly used. Marsha described herself as a gay person, a transvestite, and a drag queen. She used she/her pronouns. Marsha was part of a growing community of LGBTQ youth who sought acceptance in New York City. But in the 1950s and 1960s, LGBTQ people\u2019s rights were strictly limited. For example, dancing with a person of the same sex as well as cross-dressing were illegal. It was difficult for Marsha to find work. She realized that the fastest way to make money was to \u201chustle.\u201d This meant working as a sex worker; The work, due to stigmatization of sex workers, was incredibly dangerous. Marsha was often alone with strangers in hotel rooms and cars. Sometimes, the strangers were violent. On multiple occasions, clients pulled guns on Marsha. Once, she was even shot.\n\nMarsha spent most of her life without a permanent home. She slept in hotel rooms, restaurants, and movie theaters. She sometimes lived with friends. Even when she found work waiting tables or performing in drag shows, she still made most of her money as a sex worker. Not long after arriving in New York, 17-year-old Marsha met 11-year-old Sylvia Rivera. Sylvia was a Puerto Rican trans woman who was also new to New York. The two became instant friends. Marsha taught Sylvia how to apply makeup, live on the street, and look out for trouble. She also encouraged Sylvia to love herself and her identity. Marsha enjoyed expressing herself through her appearance. Her lavish outfits were often made from thrift store finds, gifts from friends, and items she found on the street. She also created and wore elaborate crowns of fresh flowers. Marsha\u2019s life dramatically changed when she found herself near the Stonewall Inn in the early hours of June 28, 1969. That night, police officers raided the gay bar. As the officers began to arrest people for violating various discriminatory laws, the patrons of the Stonewall fought back. While there are many conflicting stories about the uprising\u2019s start, it is clear that Marsha was on the front lines. In one account, she started the uprising by throwing a shot glass at a mirror. In another, she climbed a lamppost and dropped a heavy purse onto a police car, shattering the windshield. Young trans women like Marsha were particularly vocal that night because they felt they had nothing to left to lose. Their rage was not just about the police. It was about the oppression and fear they felt every single day.\n\nDarling, I want my gay rights now. I think it\u2019s about time the gay brothers and sisters got their rights . . . especially the women.\n\nThe Stonewall uprising was an awakening for an entire generation of LGBTQ activists. Soon, Marsha was attending rallies, sit-ins, and meetings of the newly formed Gay Liberation Front. She was excited about the work but frustrated at how white gay men and lesbians dominated the conversation. She questioned where transgender people fit in. Transpeople were more likely to be homeless and targeted by police. The movement did not appreciate the extent to which transgender youth needed help and support. In 1970, Sylvia came to Marsha with an idea. She wanted to protect young transpeople living on the street by giving them a home. She asked Marsha to help her create a place where they could feel safe, unite, and fight for their rights. Marsha and Sylvia later formed the Street Transvestite Activist Revolutionaries (STAR). The first STAR House was in the back of an abandoned truck in Greenwich Village. Nearly 24 young people called the truck home. Sylvia and Marsha hustled every night to make sure their new family had breakfast each morning. One morning, they returned to the truck just as it was pulling away with STAR residents sleeping inside. Apparently, the truck was not abandoned after all. As they watched their \u201ckids\u201d jump from a moving truck, Marsha and Sylvia realized they needed a real home. They rented a dilapidated building with no electricity or running water. They fixed up the building and paid rent for nearly eight months. When they could no longer pay, they were evicted. But the impact of STAR had already been felt by many. Even without lodgings, STAR provided a safe haven for people who had never had a place to call home. As the gay liberation movement became increasingly white, middle class, and cisgender, STAR reminded everyone that transgender and gender non-conforming people deserved equal rights too. When the organizers of the gay pride parade tried to ban STAR, they showed up anyway. In 1975, artist Andy Warhol crossed paths with Marsha and photographed her for his Ladies and Gentleman series. When a Warhol screen-print of Marsha went on display in a Greenwich Village store, Marsha took some friends to see it. The store owners called her riffraff and threw her out.\n\nMarsha\u2019s whole life seemed to be a balance between popularity and exclusion. Throughout Greenwich Village, she was known as \u201cSaint Marsha.\u201d Locals admired her ability to truly be herself. Marsha had a reputation for being generous and kind. She gave people clothes and food, even though she had little of her own. Despite her popularity, Marsha also lived a life of poverty and danger. She was arrested over 100 times. She believed no one should hustle or live on the streets, but she knew no other way to survive. In 1990, Marsha contracted AIDS. She spoke publicly about it and told people she hoped they would not be afraid of those who had the disease. On July 6, 1992, Marsha\u2019s body was found floating in the Hudson River. The police officers ruled her death a suicide. Marsha\u2019s friends and acquaintances strongly disagreed. They thought it was more likely that Marsha was a victim of an attack. Trans women, particularly women of color, were regular targets of hate crimes. The LGBTQ community was furious the police did not investigate her death. At Marsha\u2019s funeral, hundreds of people showed up. The church was so full that the crowd spilled into the street. The case involving Marsha\u2019s death remained closed for decades. In 2012, the New York City Police Department finally agreed to re-open it, yet the case still remains unsolved. Since then, Marsha has become an icon of the transgender community. In 2019, New York City announced that a statue of Marsha and Sylvia would be the first monument to honor trans women in the city. In 2020, New York State named a waterfront park in Brooklyn after Marsha.\n\nVocabulary\n\nAIDS: Acronym for Auto Immune Deficiency Disorder.

All that my big decision and move required was a few steps of preparation and a willingness to take an adventure. Here is how I did it; hopefully it helps you do the same.\n\n1. Prepare Mentally\n\nIn my experience, this is the most important step. I spontaneously bought the plane ticket that would take me to New York, but I probably thought about the idea of moving there for about three years before getting to that step. At the beginning of my senior year in college, like everyone else, I was thinking about the job market and where I should go. I majored in journalism and creative writing and needed to live somewhere with an ample amount of writing opportunities. Los Angeles crossed my mind since I grew up in the area and have family there, but something was telling me New York would be a better fit. Still, I knew the wish to move to New York wasn't enough. I had to take a few steps before making the move across the country, but the first step was to know exactly that.\n\n2. And Prepare Financially\n\nWhen I first thought about moving to New York, I knew I would need to save a lot of money \u2014 a writer living in one of the most expensive cities in America? Whew. So I decided I would go home to California after graduation for the free rent (I was lucky to have that option!) and to get a customer service job that would allow me to save. Even at this point I wasn't completely sure about New York, so I thought this time would also help me figure out how I really felt about it (and see if my parents were into the idea as well).\n\nAfter I worked and saved for about six months at home, I had enough money in my bank account to buy my ticket. The more I romanticized my decision and fantasized about the future, the farther I got from really taking action. There were times when I thought about living my \"I came to New York with one dollar and a dream!\" fantasy, but I was lying to myself. If I wanted to make and survive the move, I would need to line up as many job opportunities as I could.\n\n3. Research the City and What You'll Need to Live There\n\nPreparing for this move reminded me of how I would prepare for the public speaking class I took in high school. I researched . . . a lot! My anxiety flares up when I feel uninformed on the subjects I'm discussing and the decisions I'm making. So in the weeks leading up to buying my ticket, I watched hours of \"How I Moved to New York\" Youtube videos to gather information on rent prices in different neighborhoods. I thought about the weather and how much a legitimate Winter jacket would cost, because I knew my teddy coat was only useful in Southern California. I had no friends or relatives living in the city and I would have to rely on myself, which meant I would survive only if I prepared as much as I possibly could.\n\n4. Just Do It\n\nThe last three steps are what turned this formidable and daunting move into a realistic goal, and once I had everything else in place, it was up to me to take action. I could have done more research and saved more money forever, but I believed in myself, so I just bought the ticket. After I prepared, there was nothing stopping me except for myself.\n\nI've been in New York for a little over a month and I've cried multiple times, but in no way, shape, or form do I regret my decision. I'm proud of myself for handling something like this and tackling such a daunting task. My advice is to trust yourself, even if that means listening to that little voice in your heart saying you are so not ready. Daunting tasks are way less scary when you believe in your intuition and don't let your brain get fogged up with unlikely possibilities."}, {"url": "https://medium.com/the-post-grad-survival-guide/i-regret-moving-to-new-york-city-after-college-4cd3f9e6f54a", "page_content": "I landed on Wall Street \u2014 specifically, in a lucrative career of Investment Banking.

I was crushed beneath multiple mental breakdowns.\n\nHowever, each time I considered quitting I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of my rent, my student loans, or the other hundreds upon thousands of dollars I was expected to spend each month to maintain my livelihood in New York City.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that New York is among one of the most expensive cities in the United States. According to PayScale, New York\u2019s cost of living is 129% higher than the national average with housing expenses being 369% higher than the national average.

Greenberg, the longtime leader of Bear Stearns and the embodiment of its risk-loving culture, who died on Friday at 86.\n\nThe service began on time at 11 a.m. and lasted just about an hour, honoring the no-nonsense style of Mr. Greenberg, who was known as Ace. The mourners recalled his idiosyncratic business advice, his love of big-game hunting and his magic tricks. A representative of the Society of American Magicians, as is customary, snapped Mr. Greenberg\u2019s magic wand in two.\n\n\u201cWhat Ernest Hemingway was to the world of 20th century literature, Alan Greenberg was to the world of 20th century finance,\u201d Ronald B.

Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made a fortune during the crisis by betting against mortgages, was also in attendance.\n\nJohn A.

Cayne, Mr. Greenberg\u2019s successor at Bear Stearns and his onetime friend. The two went through a messy split as Bear Stearns stumbled, with Mr. Greenberg blaming his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for the firm\u2019s problems.\n\nMr. Schwartz, who took over from Mr. Cayne in early 2008, brushed the feud aside, saying the topic should be avoided.\n\n\u201cWhen something like Bear happens, there\u2019s always going to be some disagreements,\u201d said Mr. Schwartz, who is now the executive chairman of Guggenheim Partners. \u201cDon\u2019t go there.\u201d\n\nAlan Greenberg\u2019s 2012 interview with Bloomberg Television on the final days of Bear Stearns.]\n\nThe service attracted a number of business titans. (A reporter for BuzzFeed said he spotted Donald Trump arriving late through a side door.) On the lips of many were tales of an earlier era on Wall Street, when investment banks were privately held by their partners.\n\nMr. Schwartz, who joined Bear Stearns in 1976, said Mr. Greenberg offered him a place to stay for a few months when he moved to New York in 1978. E. John Rosenwald Jr., a longtime colleague of Mr. Greenberg\u2019s, recalled in his remarks during the service that the two of them would get rides to work from John H. Gutfreund, who was on his way to becoming the head of Salomon Brothers, and who drove a green convertible.\n\nApart from his magic tricks, Mr. Greenberg was known for his quips. Mr. Rosenwald recalled his friend\u2019s response when people would ask him why he only took vacations in the United States and never in Europe.\n\n\u201cIt took my grandparents generations to get out of there,\u201d Mr. Greenberg would say. \u201cWhy should I go back?\u201d\n\nWhen Mr. Greenberg would give gifts, he would attach prewritten thank-you notes, his son, Ted, recalled. When his children would run off on some escapade, Mr. Greenberg would advise them to have fun, \u201cbut control costs.\u201d\n\nTed Greenberg read from a letter his father had written to his wife, Kathy, with requests for the funeral.

So it\u2019s no surprise that graduates from New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business go on to have fruitful careers in finance.\n\nNYU Stern is known for churning out highly employable candidates; in 2021, nearly 96% of its graduates received a job offer within three months of graduation, according to the school\u2019s employment report. The median base salary for NYU Stern grads was $155,000, with an average signing bonus of $35,000.\n\nDespite another year of uncertainty, the school\u2019s most-recent full-time MBA class saw historically high compensation and employment outcomes, Beth Briggs, NYU\u2019s associate dean of career services, wrote in the school\u2019s 2021 employment report. \u201cThese outstanding results are built on the strong partnerships we have with our employers and alumni.\u201d\n\nA $190,000 starting salary directly from an MBA program far eclipses the median earnings of a master\u2019s degree recipient\u2014which is just $77,844, according to Northeastern University research. But certain career paths taken by Stern grads last year proved to be even more lucrative.\n\nMoney in investment banking careers\n\nMore than 28% of NYU Stern\u2019s MBA class of 2021 went into investment banking, with grads earning a median base salary of $175,000 plus a signing bonus of almost $52,000. That\u2019s more than $225,000 in earnings directly after earning an MBA degree\u2014and a 10% jump in total compensation from the prior year.\n\nInvestment banks have long recruited from top-ranked MBA programs, and recently there\u2019s been a wave of firms raising salaries for its analysts. This year, investment banks including Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Morgan Stanley have either bumped up or promised to raise the starting salaries for analysts.\n\nMBA grads are typically hired at the analyst or associate levels, which have an average base salary of $85,000 to $95,000 and $150,000 to $200,000, respectively, according to research by Mergers & Inquisitions. While NYU Stern shared figures only for base salaries and signing bonuses, investment bankers will typically rake in far more than that amount.\n\nThese finance professionals have the potential to earn stub bonuses (essentially a midyear bonus), an end-of-year cash bonus, a stock-based bonus, and other bonuses. This additional compensation could bump salaries for investment bankers closer to a range of $250,000 to $450,000, according to M&I data.\n\nWhy investment banks shell out for MBA grads\n\nInvestment banks are looking for three things in job candidates, Jeremy Shinewald, founder and president of MbaMission, an MBA admissions and career consulting firm, tells Fortune. Firms seek people who can work hard, have very strong analytical skills, and confer prestige upon the bank to impress investment banking clients. Essentially, these firms are looking for the type of people who graduate from top business school programs.\n\n\u201cThey want people who are not just willing to sacrifice their time and their personal lives, but also have such strong analytical capabilities that every single number in a high-density, high-profile deal will be perfect,\u201d he says.\n\nInvestment bankers work long hours\u2014think 16-hour days\u2014and thus give up much of their freedom outside the office. Often, investment deals must be done quickly and confidently, Shinewald says.\n\nThat\u2019s why investment banks are attracted to MBA candidates. Simply put, MBA grads are predisposed to working very, very hard, Shinewald says. Plus, investment banks will pay up for \u201crisk management,\u201d as he puts it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re trying to make sure that you\u2019re getting the best people who make the fewest mistakes in the most intense, high-pressure situations, which is what the banks get paid for,\u201d Shinewald says. \u201cI think that\u2019s why the banks continue to try to recruit from top schools.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Daniel-Burnham", "page_content": "Returning to Chicago, Burnham became a draftsman for the famed civil engineer and architect William Le Baron Jenney . He wrote to his mother in 1868 that he would become \u201cthe greatest architect in the city and country.\u201d Nevertheless, ambitious, young, and restless, he quit his job with Jenney in order to seek his fortune in Nevada, where he tried mining and also ran for the state senate. Unsuccessful in both attempts, he returned to Chicago in 1870 ready to begin an architectural career in earnest .\n\nBurnham and his family moved to Chicago in January 1855. There he attended Snow\u2019s Swedenborgian Academy and later Central High School, where he was remembered for his leadership and artistic ability. In 1863, after he had graduated, his parents sent him to the newly incorporated New-Church Theological School in Waltham, Massachusetts, for further study. He prepared for college with a Swedenborgian tutor, the Reverend Tilly Brown Hayward. Through Hayward, Burnham met the architect and writer W.P.P. Longfellow, who encouraged Burnham\u2019s interest in architecture . When it came time to take his college entrance exams at Harvard and Yale , he failed both because he was \u201cnot able to write a word,\u201d as he later recalled. Years later both universities would award him honorary degrees.\n\nBurnham was the sixth of seven children and the youngest son. His parents were members of the Church of the New Jerusalem (now New Church ), or Swedenborgians, a maverick Christian religious sect named for Emanuel Swedenborg , a Swedish scientist and mystic who disagreed with church hierarchy and stressed being of service to others.\n\nBurnham & Root\n\nIn 1872 Burnham joined the office of Carter, Drake & Wight, where he met John Wellborn Root, a talented architect and the office foreman. Burnham, eager to start his own firm, persuaded Root to become his partner a year later. Root was primarily responsible for design while Burnham planned the layout of their building interiors and organized the business. As best friends and professional colleagues, they worked closely together. Of their business relationship, their one-time boss Peter Wight recalled in a 1912 address before the Illinois chapter of the American Institute of Architects:\n\nBurnham had a great faculty of impressing his clients with the firm\u2019s ability to solve any problem that came to it. He would make rapid sketches, which Root afterward elaborated with the greatest care. He inspired confidence in all who came within the range of his positive and powerful personality. Root had the ability to carry to success anything that Burnham offered to do.\n\nBurnham & Root became one of the preeminent firms in the history of American architecture. It was known for its size and wide range of projects.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Sherman in 1874, caught the discerning eye of their contemporary and rival Louis Sullivan, who recalled its fine lines and proportions in his autobiography.\n\nTwo events triggered a period of extraordinary growth in Chicago: the end of the Civil War and the Chicago fire of 1871. Burnham, always thinking big, was quick to recognize the needs of commercial clients. A series of bold solutions to some of the challenges of building higher structures provided examples for others to follow and led Burnham & Root to the forefront of their profession. As an example, for the 10-story Montauk Block (1882\u201383)\u2014perhaps the first building to be labeled a \u201cskyscraper\u201d\u2014Burnham & Root devised a new kind of foundation footing. This footing, consisting of a broad slab of concrete reinforced with iron rails, allowed the Montauk, and future taller, heavier buildings, to be built in Chicago\u2019s unstable soil. Burnham & Root also extended the typical Chicago construction time frame by continuing to build throughout the winter months. They used a tentlike structure over the site and placed heaters inside. Additionally, the Montauk was noteworthy for its fireproofing system, which employed a hollow tile subfloor and tiles to encase both beams and columns, and was hailed as one of the first truly fireproof buildings. The Montauk Block created a new urban scale for commercial structures, while its form and plain surfaces reflected an aesthetic based on functionality, a hallmark of the new commercial architecture.\n\nAmong their other notable early works are the Rookery (completed 1886), the second Rand McNally Building (completed 1890, demolished 1911), the Monadnock Building (completed 1891), and the Masonic Temple (completed 1892). Finished a year after William Le Baron Jenney\u2019s Home Insurance Building (completed 1885), which was the first building to use structural steel members for partial support, the Rookery used both a masonry load-bearing wall and a skeleton frame (a grid of vertical steel columns and horizontal steel beams) in its construction. But it is the smaller Rand McNally Building that is credited as the first steel-frame building. Burnham & Root\u2019s 16-story Monadnock Building reached the tallest practical height using traditional construction techniques. At 21 stories high, Burnham & Root\u2019s Masonic Temple with its great atrium would be a wonder: the tallest office building in the world in terms of occupied floors. In their 18-year partnership, Burnham and Root built nearly 300 structures\u2014among them railroad stations, warehouses, office buildings, residences, armories, schools, clubs, and churches.\n\nAt a time when architecture was still emerging as a profession, Burnham organized his office for maximum efficiency and created a model for future architectural firms. The firm\u2019s clients were ushered into a handsome paneled office with velvet curtains, a library of architectural drawing books, and a small copy of the Venus de Milo perched on the mantle over the fireplace. The tradesmen with whom they worked were scheduled to meet with the firm only on designated days. The office floorplan, which was published as a model for the profession, even had a gym."}, {"url": "https://www.moving.com/tips/moving-to-new-york-city/", "page_content": "New York City is arguably the most famous city in the world. It is also the largest city in the United States, with a population of roughly 8.8 million. It has the nation\u2019s largest economy, generating a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of almost $1.7 trillion in 2020. According to the World Bank, that\u2019s equivalent to the entire nation of Canada! As a result, jobs and opportunities abound in New York, but the city also has an amazing quality of life with some of the nation\u2019s best museums and entertainment opportunities. We\u2019ve compiled a guide to moving to New York City covering everything from where to live to what to expect, what jobs are available and how to get around the city. Here\u2019s what you need to know about moving to The Big Apple.\n\nWhat is it like living in New York City?\n\nNew York City is unlike any other city in the United States. Life here is fast-paced with endless possibilities. You\u2019ll always find something to do, from attending concerts and theater to enjoying some of the nation\u2019s best restaurants and bars. Despite how urban it is, the city also has 28,000 acres of green space, including Central Park. You can walk or bicycle in the parks, kayak on the Hudson River and even ice skate without leaving the city.\n\nThe city is also incredibly diverse. People from all over the world move to NYC for new opportunities. You\u2019ll hear approximately 800 different languages spoken in its streets and find restaurants and grocery stores representing all the major cuisines in the world.\n\nWho is moving to New York City ?\n\nWe typically think of young dreamer who wants to make it big in the arts, on Broadway or on Wall Street as the most common type of person who moves to New York City, but that\u2019s only a fraction of the people who decide to relocate to the Big Apple. Roughly 40 percent of all people who live in New York (3.3 million) are foreign-born immigrants, according to the city\u2019s Comptroller\u2019s Office.\n\nPlenty of Americans move to New York, too. In its migration report, Apartment List found that the highest percentage of people moving to the city are those from Philadelphia, Miami and Washington D.C. Although the report doesn\u2019t indicate why they are moving, one reason could be for their job. Companies like Sony, Pfizer, Deutsche Bank Americas Holding, Verizon, MetLife and Twenty-First Century Fox rank among the largest employers in the city.\n\nWhat is NYC\u2019s cost of living?\n\nNew York has the highest cost of living in the nation. The cost of living is determined by comparing the cost of living index score in a particular city to the cost of living in other cities. If a city\u2019s index score is higher than 100, then the cost of living is above average. If a city\u2019s index score is lower than 100, then the cost of living is below average.\n\nAccording to AreaVibes, New York has an overall cost of living index of 161, 61 percent higher than the national average of 100. Housing is the biggest factor with an index of 234, but you also pay 48 percent above the national average for groceries, 33 percent more for goods and services, and 32 percent more for transportation.\n\nNumbeo estimates it will cost a family of four $5,035.72 per month to meet its expenses before rent. A single person will need $1,371.06 per month, not including rent. How does that compare to other expensive cities? According to Numbeo, living in New York is 27 percent more expensive than living in Los Angeles before rent. New York is also the only U.S. city to make MSN\u2019s 2021 list of most expensive cities globally, including Singapore, London, Beijing, and Geneva.\n\nWhat jobs are available in New York City?\n\nSince its beginnings, New York City has been the nation\u2019s financial and business epicenter. You\u2019ll find financial jobs on Wall Street and beyond at companies like Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase Co., Moody\u2019s, American Express, MetLife and Deutsche Bank. The Bank of China is the second-largest company in the city, employing more than 300,000 people.\n\nMedia and entertainment are equally big industries. The city is home to Broadway and off-Broadway theaters as well as the Lincoln Center, the Apollo Theater and Madison Square Garden. But New York is also where you\u2019ll find company headquarters for NBCUniversal, Sony Corporation of America, Warner Media, Hearst, Conde Nates, HBO and CBS.\n\nOther industries flourish, too. You can get a job in the fashion industry working at companies like Christian Dior, Triumph Apparel, Aeropostale, Estee Lauder and Ralph Lauren. Or look for a job in the hospitality industry. Sheraton Hotels and Resorts and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts rank among the city\u2019s largest employers. Looking for a job in the technology industry? IBM employs roughly 350,000 people.\n\nUnfortunately, you won\u2019t be the only one looking for jobs at these companies and the likes of Pfizer, Verizon, Heineken, JetBlue Airways, Loews and Texaco. New York City is one of the most competitive job markets in the nation. This is reflected in its 6.6 percent unemployment rate, significantly higher than the national unemployment rate of 3.9 percent.\n\nIf you are moving to New York to break into a competitive industry like theater, save up enough to cover your expenses for three to six months, at least.\n\nWhat salary can you expect in New York City?\n\nIn 2019, the median household income in New York City was approximately $63,998, according to U.S. census data. This is slightly higher than the national median household income of $62,843.\n\nWhat is the real estate market like in New York City?\n\nReal estate in the Big Apple is 134 percent higher than the national average, according to AreaVibes. Realtor.com indicates the median listing home price in New York City is $859,000, which translates to a median price per square foot of $919. By comparison, the median price per square foot in Austin, Texas, is $320. However, San Francisco puts New York City\u2019s real estate into perspective. In San Francisco, the median listing home price is $1.2 million, and the median price per square foot is $1,000.\n\nBecause it costs so much to buy a home in New York City, many people rent instead. According to ApartmentList.com, the average rent for a studio apartment in NYC is $3,237. A 1-bedroom apartment goes for $3,805, while a 2-bedroom goes for $5,748. In addition, you\u2019ll need a broker to rent an apartment, and brokers typically charge 10 to 15 percent of the annual rent for your apartment. Even so, competition for apartments in the city is fierce.\n\nThere are ways to alleviate high rental costs. First, search for an apartment during the off-seasons of fall and winter, when there may be fewer available apartments, but rent prices are lower. Or you can share the cost of a rental with roommates. Another option is to shop in a different neighborhood. You\u2019ll pay much more for an apartment in Manhattan than in the Bronx, for example.\n\nWhere s hould y ou l ive in NYC ?\n\nNew York City is divided into five boroughs: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island. Each has its own personality, and within each borough, different neighborhoods will also stand out. Here\u2019s an overview of what to expect.\n\nManhattan: Densely populated and lined with skyscrapers, Manhattan is home to Wall Street, the United Nations and the headquarters of many multinational and national corporations. Considering this, it\u2019s no surprise that rent here is expensive. Some parts of Manhattan are more reasonable than others, so check out the Lower East Side or trendy East Village if you have your heart set on living here.\n\nBrooklyn: The most populous of the boroughs, Brooklyn is nicknamed the \u201cBorough of Homes and Churches.\u201d It was originally its own city, it has its own art scene, and it is where you\u2019ll find Coney Island, one of the oldest amusement parks in the nation.\n\nQueens: In terms of surface area, Queens is the largest. It\u2019s also the most ethnically diverse and, despite its name, is decidedly middle class. Queens is the home of the city\u2019s two international airports, John F. Kennedy International Airport and La Guardia Airport.\n\nBronx: The Bronx is probably the most affordable of all the boroughs. It\u2019s known for Yankee Stadium, Bronx Zoo, New York Botanical Garden and is the birthplace of hip-hop. It\u2019s also home to beautiful historic buildings and homes. Planning to work in Manhattan? Brace yourself for a long commute.\n\nStaten Island: This borough is more suburban than the others and boasts a little more breathing room. It is the least populated of the boroughs but has the third-largest land area. If you decide to move here, though, you\u2019ll have to rely on the Staten Island Ferry since the subway does not operate on the island.\n\nTaxes in New York City\n\nNew York City residents pay federal income tax, state income tax and city income tax. According to your income level, combined income taxes can be more than 50 percent. Top earners will pay 39.6 percent in federal income tax, 8.82 percent in state income tax and 3.876 percent in city income tax. Most people will pay 6.21 percent in state income tax and 3.819 percent in city income tax, though.\n\nSales tax in New York is high. The U.S.\u2019s average combined sales tax (state, county and city) is 6.35 percent. While the state sales tax in New York is 4 percent, you\u2019ll pay a county city tax. In New York City, regardless of which borough you live, you\u2019ll pay an additional 4.875 for a total city sales tax of 8.875 percent.\n\nDo you need a car in NYC?\n\nNo, you don\u2019t need a car to live in New York City. You may be better off without one. Traffic is notoriously bad in NYC, and gas is more expensive. According to Gasbuddy, the average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gas in New York City is $3.75 per gallon. This is higher than the national average, which is $3.53 (when this article was written).\n\nBut gas prices shouldn\u2019t be your only concern. According to Bankrate, the city has some of the highest car insurance rates in the country, with full coverage averaging $2,321. On top of that, you\u2019ll pay for parking. SpotHero estimates NYC residents pay an average of $570 per month in parking expenses. You may pay much more ($700 per month for valet parking on Broadway) or less ($188 per month in Brooklyn).\n\nInstead of driving, many New Yorkers rely on public transportation. The city\u2019s subway operates 24 hours a day, supplemented by a public bus system, commuter rail network and the Staten Island Ferry. Plus, the cost of riding public transportation is reasonable. Individual subway rides cost $2.75 per ride, but you can purchase a 30-day unlimited ride pass for $127. Rides on the Staten Island Ferry are free.\n\nWhen weather permits, some New Yorkers bike their way through the city. Of course, walking is always a good way to get around, t00. You can also take taxis and rideshares.\n\nMore t o c onsider\n\nThere\u2019s always something to do. The city has a full calendar of special events, from the Tribeca Film Festival and the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show to New York Fashion Week and holiday celebrations late in the year. Don\u2019t miss NYC Restaurant Week or Theater Week if you want to enjoy the city\u2019s best on a budget.\n\nNew York City has four seasons. Winters and falls are usually cold, while summer is hot and humid. Before moving, invest in a winter jacket, boots for snow and slush, and warm clothes.\n\nThe city is home to Fordham University, the Juilliard School, City University of New York (CUNY) schools, Columbia University, Queens College and State University of New York (SUNY) schools.\n\nReady to move to New York ?\n\nFor more information about moving to New York, check out the City Profile Report.
