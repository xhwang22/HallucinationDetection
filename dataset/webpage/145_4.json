He is James Graham whose play Eden\u2019s Empire was written whilst attached to the Finborough Theatre.\n\nThe Pearson Playwrights\u2019 Scheme, formerly known as the Thames Television Theatre Writers\u2019 Scheme, is one of the most prestigious awards for new writing in British theatre. It awards up to five bursaries a year, each worth \u00a37,000, to writers of outstanding promise and allows the playwright a twelve-month attachment to a theatre and commissions the writers for a new play. Recipients of the bursaries for 2008 will be announced later this month.\n\nThe Scheme also offers an award for the Best Play written by the five bursary winners from the previous year. This new award, worth \u00a310,000, has been generously donated by Catherine Johnson, a graduate of the Scheme and herself the winner of the Best Play written in 1991. Catherine, who is a member of the judging panel for new bursaries and author of Mamma Mia, has been looking for a way to give something back to the Scheme which helped and encouraged her in the early days of her career.\n\nJudges of the Pearson Award include Sir John Mortimer CBE QC, Dame Beryl Bainbridge, Catherine Johnson, Sue Summers, Thelma Holt CBE, Michael Billington, John Tydeman OBE and Jack Andrews MBE.\n\nPrevious recipients of the Pearson bursary over the last thirty years include Richard Bean, Alan Bleasdale, Gregory Burke, David Edgar, David Eldridge, Lee Hall, Jacqueline Holborough, Catherine Johnson, Charlotte Jones, Fin Kennedy, Hanif Kureshi, Nick Leather, Martin McDonagh, Gary Mitchell, Chloe Moss, Gary Owen, Joe Penhall, Winsome Pinnock, Billy Roche, Simon Stephens, Sue Townsend and Timberlake Wertenbaker.\n\nPrevious winners for the Pearson Award for the Finborough Theatre include Chris Lee in 2000, Laura Wade in 2005 for Colder Than Here which also won the Pearson Award for the Best Play, James Graham in 2006 and Al Smith in 2007.

She calculated flight trajectories, by hand, for the United States space program.\n\nWithout the brilliance of a mind like Johnson\u2019s, it\u2019s uncertain whether John Glenn would have pioneered space missions and doubtful Neil Armstrong would have been the first human to step onto the surface of the moon.\n\nHer precise calculations ensured the astronauts made it to space safely and back.\n\nFor her contributions to space exploration, Katherine Johnson, who died in February 2020 at the age of 101, was selected as the 2020 recipient of the National Geographic Society Hubbard Medal, awarded for achievement in research, discovery, and exploration. Though she herself wasn\u2019t physically exploring space, without her there might not have been any exploration at all.\n\nIn 1969, the Apollo astronauts were awarded the same prize. Now, the excellent work that made the mission possible is being celebrated.\n\n5:07\n\n\"We are honored to present Katherine Johnson the Hubbard Medal, the National Geographic Society's highest recognition, for her extraordinary contributions in the fields of science and exploration,\u201d National Geographic Society CEO Jill Tiefenthaler said this week. \u201cFifty years ago, the Apollo 11 astronauts were awarded with the medal, and we\u2019re honored to recognize the mathematician whose precise calculations made those flights possible. Katherine's legacy of exploration, innovation and inspiration lives on, and we are in awe of her remarkable achievements.\"\n\nThat legacy of inspiration lives on in Kavita Gupta, a chemistry teacher at Monta Vista High School, in Cupertino, California. Gupta says Johnson is her hero. \u201cKatherine Johnson, the human computer, the third African-American woman to get a Ph.D., who helped NASA put an astronaut into orbit and then help put a man on the moon, inspires me with her pioneering legacy to break barriers and to challenge norms as a teacher and as a woman of color,\u201d Gupta says.\n\nAs seen in the 2016 Academy Award-nominated film Hidden Figures, Johnson was among a group of Black women described as \u201chuman computers\u201d who worked at NASA, then called the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, calculating space flight trajectories by hand. (Historic pictures show the hidden women of the space race.)\n\nHer exceptional work as a mathematician guided the 1961 mission on which Alan B. Shepherd became the first American in space. A year later, her calculating skills helped John Glenn to become the first American to orbit the Earth. Most notably, in 1969 she calculated trajectories that led the Apollo 11 to the moon, one of America\u2019s greatest scientific feats.\n\nJohnson has been called a math genius. She entered high school when she was 10 and graduated four years later. She then entered West Virginia State College, a historically Black College and University, and finished her undergraduate degree by the age of 18.\n\nJohnson was fortunate to have had access to schools and education beyond the reach of most African Americans at the time. In her hometown of White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia, Black students in the segregated education system could go no further than sixth grade. Because of this, Johnson\u2019s father, Joshua Coleman, moved the family 125 miles to the town of Institute, also in West Virginia, where she and her siblings could receive a full education.\n\nIn 1939, Johnson was selected to become the first Black woman to integrate West Virginia University\u2019s graduate school, where she pursued a master\u2019s degree in mathematics.\n\nIn 1952 Johnson joined NASA and its cohort of Black women mathematicians.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t Johnson\u2019s intention to break down barriers, says Kathy Moore, the youngest of her three daughters.\n\n\u201cShe was a mathematician bar none, but she didn't wear it,\u201d Moore says. \u201cYou know, she just did it.\u201d\n\nBoth Johnson\u2019s living daughters followed in their mother\u2019s footsteps to became mathematicians. Joylette Hylick began working for NASA after she graduated from Hampton University in 1962. Moore had a 33-year career as math teacher and counselor. Both are now retired. A third daughter, Constance Goble Garcia, died in 2010.\n\n\u2018She was fearless\u2019\n\nMoore says her mother was a model of fearlessness when she and her sisters were growing up.\n\n\u201cYou can just imagine in the 30s, 40s, and 50s,\u201d Moore says. \u201cIt was kind of hard for females to be in the workforce number one, and then to be in a field like research, and mathematics, she sort of had to feel her way. What she had that I think got her through was, she was fearless.\u201d\n\nHylick remembers her mother telling her and her sisters to do what you have to do to get the job done. \u201cMy mom said, be assertive, not aggressive. You know, you don't have to make too much noise, just do what you have to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople ask if John Glenn, or the astronauts, knew mom,\u201d Hylick says. \u201cI think they knew of her. They knew her reputation, but there probably was no more respect than that because when the day was over, they went into their white world. We went into our world,\u201d she says, adding, \u201cwe had everything we needed except money and opportunity.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s efforts opened doors for others, and she laid the groundwork for women astronauts such as Christina Koch, who held the record for the longest single space flight by a woman after completing her first mission on board the International Space Station in March 2019. On the following mission, in October, Koch and crewmate Jessica Meir made the first all-female space walk.\n\nPlease be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

But what I see as similarities is that we were both motivated by a true love for what we saw as our calling.\u201d (Remembering Katherine Johnson for her love of numbers.)\n\nIn 2016, NASA named a $30 million, 40,000-square-foot Computational Research Facility in her honor.\n\nFormer NASA administrator and astronaut Charlie F. Bolden says he hadn\u2019t heard about Katherine Johnson while he was growing up or even later during his career.\n\n\u201cWhen president Obama decided to give her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, I said, I have to be there.\u2019 I was literally in tears throughout the entire ceremony, because this was an iconic figure that I was finally having an opportunity to meet.\u201d\n\nInfluencing Black students today\n\nJohnson\u2019s work and legacy influences Black children aspiring to be scientists or to enter the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, known as STEM.

She and sisters Madison, 10, and Monroe, 7, dressed up as the women featured in the Hidden Figures movie. \u201cWhat made her so special was how she did all of those things with people around her doubting what she said and did,\u201d Wellon says. \u201cKatherine Johnson has taught me to believe in myself and not look for approval from other people, especially men.\u201d\n\nMadison Wellons says Johnson gives her the confidence that she too can achieve anything. \u201cKatherine Johnson was special because she was the most brilliant and smartest person in the room, and she knew it, but she was also humble about it,\u201d Madison says. \u201cKatherine Johnson taught me not to let anyone bring me down and that women are capable of doing anything they want to do.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about what the Hubbard Medal means to the Johnson family, daughters Moore and Hylick say their mother would have been gratified to be recognized with such a prestigious award.\n\n\u201cI just think that award, you know, it's gone to the astronauts, it's gone to deGrasse Tyson, it's gone to people that have been recognized as innovators,\u201d Moore says. \u201cShe was an exciting, quiet thunder who managed to open up the world of space, but I think in terms of the medal, she would say, \u2018I can't believe it.\u2019 I think she would be quite honored to be in the presence of, or on the list with, those people.\u201d\n\nMeet the 2020 National Geographic Award recipients For more than 130 years, the National Geographic Society has invested in and elevated the work of explorers, educators and storytellers. On Thursday, eight other inspiring pioneers were honored with National Geographic Awards, given annually to the world\u2019s most innovative trailblazers who have made incredible contributions in science, education, technology, storytelling, and conservation. Rolex National Geographic Explorer of the Year: Corey Jaskolski Engineer Corey Jaskolski, recipient of the explorer of the year award, was honored for his innovative imaging techniques which have helped redefine exploration and conservation. A National Geographic Fellow, engineer and inventor, Jaskolski designs, builds and deploys technologies for exploration and conservation missions in some of the world\u2019s most unique and unforgiving environments. Eliza Scidmore Award for Outstanding Science Media: Erika Larsen As an award-winning photographer and storyteller, Larsen creates intimate essays about cultures that maintain close ties with nature. The Eliza Scidmore Award recognizes her inclusive, visionary, and conservation-focused storytelling. Further Award: Jimmy Chin & Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi Through their daring and captivating work, Jimmy Chin and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi have given us a front-row seat to astonishing physical feats and triumphs and a spellbinding look at hard-to-reach places that few have seen in person. Among their groundbreaking films is the award-winning Free Solo, which follows climber Alex Honnold as he becomes the first person to ascend Yosemite\u2019s El Capitan without a rope. They received the Further Award for their achievements as boundary-pushing filmmakers and storytellers. Gilbert M. Grosvenor Educator of the Year: Jennifer Chavez-Miller As a full-time educator at Central New Mexico Community College, Jennifer Chavez-Miller creates unique opportunities for her students to develop global competence and connect with the world. Her commitment to inspiring a new generation of empowered, curious, and engaged lifelong learners and global citizens is the reason educator Jennifer Chavez-Miller was selected for the Gilbert M. Grosvenor Educator of the Year award. National Geographic Society/Buffett Awards for Leadership in Conservation: Jeannie Raharimampionona & Angela Maldonado Conservationist Jeannie Raharimampionona was awarded the National Geographic Society/Buffett Award for Leadership in Conservation in Africa for her dedication over the last two decades to protecting and bringing awareness to the massive destruction of the Malagasy flora. Through her work, Jeannie has created 11 \u2014 soon to be 12 \u2014 protected areas that will help conserve the extraordinary diversity of plants only found in Madagascar. Conservationist Angela Maldonado was awarded the National Geographic Society/Buffett Award for Leadership in Conservation in Latin America for her dedication to reducing the illegal wildlife trade in the Colombian and Peruvian Amazon. Her efforts have resulted in a hunting ban on night monkeys and an open investigation into this illegal market, dramatically reducing the trafficking of night monkeys captured and sold for use in laboratory experiments. Planetary Leadership Award: Justin Trudeau Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, received the Planetary Leadership Award in recognition of his efforts to protect Canada\u2019s land and waters. Trudeau has increased Canada\u2019s protected marine areas from less than one percent in 2015 to 14 percent today. Though the award is being given to the Prime Minister, it also recognizes Canada\u2019s partnership with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Government of Nunavut to invest almost $200 million to establish Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area and Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area. This transformative partnership with Indigenous peoples will help protect more than 425,000 square kilometers of ocean."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Katherine-Johnson-mathematician", "page_content": "Katherine Johnson\u2019s maiden name was Coleman. From 1939 to 1956 she was Katherine Goble, having married James Goble. Three years after his death, she married James Johnson.\n\nIn 1939 Johnson was selected to be one of the first three African American students to enroll in a graduate program at West Virginia University. Later she was a member of a group of NASA employees called \"computers,\" made up of African American women who excelled in mathematics and problem-solving.\n\nKatherine Johnson, n\u00e9e Katherine Coleman, also known as (1939\u201356) Katherine Goble, (born August 26, 1918, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, U.S.\u2014died February 24, 2020, Newport News, Virginia), American mathematician who calculated and analyzed the flight paths of many spacecraft during her more than three decades with the U.S. space program. Her work helped send astronauts to the Moon.\n\nColeman\u2019s intelligence and skill with numbers became apparent when she was a child; by the time she was 10 years old, she had started attending high school. In 1937, at age 18, Coleman graduated with highest honours from West Virginia State College (now West Virginia State University), earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in mathematics and French. She subsequently moved to Virginia to take a teaching job. In 1939, however, she was selected to be one of the first three African American students to enroll in a graduate program at West Virginia University. She studied math there but soon left after marrying James Goble and deciding to start a family. He died in 1956, and three years later she married James Johnson.\n\nBritannica Quiz Numbers and Mathematics\n\nIn 1953 she began working at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)\u2019s West Area Computing unit, a group of African American women who manually performed complex mathematical calculations for the program\u2019s engineers. The women, known as the West Computers, analyzed test data and provided mathematical computations that were essential to the success of the early U.S. space program. During this time, NACA was segregated, and the West Computers had to use separate bathrooms and dining facilities. That changed in 1958 when NACA was incorporated into the newly formed National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which banned segregation.\n\nAt NASA Johnson was a member of the Space Task Group. In 1960 she coauthored a paper with one of the group\u2019s engineers about calculations for placing a spacecraft into orbit. It was the first time a woman in her division received credit as an author of a research report. Johnson authored or coauthored 26 research reports during her career.\n\nJohnson also played an important role in NASA\u2019s Mercury program (1961\u201363) of crewed spaceflights. In 1961 she calculated the path for Freedom 7, the spacecraft that put the first U.S astronaut in space, Alan B. Shepard, Jr. The following year, at the request of John Glenn, Johnson verified that the electronic computer had planned his flight correctly. Glenn subsequently made history aboard Friendship 7, becoming the first U.S. astronaut to orbit Earth. Johnson was also part of the team that calculated where and when to launch the rocket for the Apollo 11 mission of 1969, which sent the first three men to the Moon. Johnson later worked on the space shuttle program. She retired from NASA in 1986.\n\nJohnson received numerous awards and honours for her work, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2015). In 2016 NASA named a building, the Katherine G. Johnson Computational Research Facility, after her. That year Margot Lee Shetterly published Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Mathematicians Who Helped Win the Space Race, about the West Computers, including Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. A film based on the book was also released in 2016. Johnson\u2019s memoir, My Remarkable Journey (2021; written with Joylette Hylick and Katherine Moore), was published posthumously."}, {"url": "https://study.com/academy/lesson/katherine-johnson-facts-accomplishments.html", "page_content": "Kimberly Slifer has a bachelor\u2019s degree in biology with a minor in chemistry. Additionally, she has two master\u2019s degrees. One in biology education and one in educational leadership. She has eight years of experience teaching high school Biology and Anatomy as well as Dual Enrollment Biology.\n\nWho was Katherine Johnson?\n\nKatherine Johnson (maiden name Coleman) was best known for her work at NASA to support America in the space race in the 1950s. She is famous for being awarded the Presidential Medal of Honor, having a building named after her at NASA, and having her life legacy depicted in the book and subsequent movie, \"Hidden Figures.\" However, her journey to NASA was not an easy one. The 1950s were a time of racism and segregation which created constant roadblocks for people of color. Johnson greatly contributed to America's first human spaceflight, conducting the mathematical trajectory for that mission. Johnson then became a contributor to Glenn's Friendship 7 Mission, performing the math work to ensure the computers were correct. Because of these projects and her work, America was able to enter the space race with the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1952, Katherine Johnson moved her family to Virginia to work in aeronautics. Johnson began work with NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) which eventually became NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration). This was a challenging journey as she was only one of three Black women who were working at NASA. The other two women were Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan. Johnson was also groundbreaking in other ways outside of the aeronautical world. Johnson was a pioneer for people of color as well as women during a time of segregation and women's suffrage. In her youth, she was also one of three Black students that were the first to study at the previously all-white West Virginia State University graduate program.\n\n\n\n\n\nKatherine Johnson\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily and Early Life\n\nKatherine Coleman was born in 1918 in White Sulfur Springs, West Virginia, to Joylette, a teacher, and Joshua, a farmer and janitor. Because this was before Brown vs. Board of education, segregation in schools was still common. Sulfur Springs in particular did not have a school that Black students were able to attend. To get away from an area of extreme segregation and nourish her desire to learn, Johnson's family moved to Institute, West Virginia. There she attended West Virginia State High School, where she graduated at the age of fourteen. It was at this high school that Katherine found her love for and talents in both mathematics and astronomy.\n\nAfter earning her high school diploma, she attended West Virginia State University (then known as West Virginia State College) and earned a BS in both French and mathematics in 1937. College was a difficult time for Katherine as she had to work harder to prove that not only people of color, but women could be successful in college, specifically in mathematics. Katherine was so successful at mathematics that a special course was created just for her called \"analytic geometry.\"\n\nLife After College\n\nAfter college, Katherine married James Goble and began attending graduate school. However, when she became pregnant, she left college to focus on her family and became a school teacher of mathematics. She taught mathematics in both elementary and high school. She and James had three daughters: Constance, Joylette, and Katherine. Unfortunately, in 1956, James died from a brain tumor. In 1959, Katherine married Colonel James A. Johnson.\n\nIn 1953, Katherine missed the laboratory setting and moved her family to Newport News, Virginia to work at NACA. During the 1950s, computers were very new and not trustworthy. However, few people understood the complex mathematics required for space travel. This was how Katherine was able to achieve her position as the only woman on the team, despite the hurdles of segregation and sexism. She was exceptional in her ability to calculate trajectories necessary for space flights. Her skills were so important to the success of the mission that she was a high priority at the meetings, which were up until then only open to men. If it were not for her ability to perform calculations better than the computers of that time, the astronauts' safety would have been at risk. In 1958, NACA became NASA and Johnson joined the Spacecraft Controls Branch to help calculate the trajectories for the mission to bring the first American into space, Alan Shepherd."}, {"url": "https://officiallondontheatre.com/news/tma-award-winners-announced-102664/", "page_content": "Black Watch, the RSC\u2019s Histories cycle and The Pitmen Painters were among several shows seen in London recently which were honoured at the Theatrical Management Association Awards held at Hampstead theatre yesterday.

Prize recipients are celebrated for creating and disseminating knowledge that has a global impact.\n\nDr. Johnson\u2019s work is more than global, and focuses on the history and evolution of terrestrial planets \u2013 namely, Mercury, Mars and Venus. She uses remotely-sensed geophysical data to better understand the history and evolution of terrestrial planets, and has worked on several NASA planetary missions, including the Mars InSight mission and the Mercury MESSENGER mission. Her current work aims to understand the magnetic fields of Mercury and Mars, including when and why they formed, their current state, and how the fields interact with the solar wind. \u201cA huge unknown\u201d she explains, \u201cis the level to which magnetic fields protect a planet\u2019s atmosphere from space weather\u201d, a question with implications for human space exploration and habitability in this solar system and beyond.\n\nHer work also focuses on planetary evolution and internal structure, and what that means for current planetary seismic and volcanic activity. Dr. Johnson works with a wide range of remotely sensed data, including altimetry, radar and gravity measurements. Data is collected by lightweight, low-power, instruments specifically designed to resist the challenges of operating in space.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re required to be very creative, in a responsible way\u201d she says of the intrinsic limitations on data quality and availability. Leaps and bounds in instrument technology between missions means that new data can improve on in resolution by an order of magnitude or more, revealing in detail features that may have previously taken up only a handful of pixels. \u201cI love it; with each new mission to a planet or moon or asteroid you almost always see something unexpected.\u201d\n\nLooking forward, Professor Johnson is excited for multiple upcoming missions to Venus which will collect data on the composition and structure of the planet\u2019s atmosphere and surface. She plans to answer questions about Venus\u2019 suspected volcanic and tectonic activity using data previously shrouded from view by the planet\u2019s thick, toxic atmosphere. \u201cVenus was my first planet\u201d she says, referring to the geophysical work she did on the planet during her PhD and postdoctoral studies. \u201cIt is so different from the Earth in so many ways, but would look equally habitable to our planet from a galaxy away \u2013 why is that?\u201d\n\nThough not directly involved in the upcoming missions, Dr. Johnson will have access to the resulting publicly available data. With datasets so sparse and expensive to obtain, collaboration is a driving force in propelling the field of planetary science forward.

President Obama awarded the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor to her in person in a ceremony held at the White House on Nov. 24.\n\n\u201cKatherine G. Johnson is a pioneer in American space history. A NASA mathematician, Johnson\u2019s computations have influenced every major space program from Mercury through the Shuttle program,\u201d read the White House press release. Johnson\u2019s contributions are all the more remarkable given that she is a female African-American who grew up at the height of tensions around racial segregation in the nation. Said NASA Administrator Charles Bolden in a statement:\n\nKatherine Johnson once remarked that even though she grew up in the height of segregation, she didn\u2019t think much about it because \u2018I didn\u2019t have time for that\u2026 don\u2019t have a feeling of inferiority. Never had. I\u2019m as good as anybody, but no better.\u2019\n\nThe truth in fact, is that Katherine is indeed better. She\u2019s one of the greatest minds ever to grace our agency or our country, and because of the trail she blazed, young Americans like my granddaughters can pursue their own dreams without a feeling of inferiority.\n\nJohnson\u2019s remarkable talent in mathematics was coupled with a boldness of character\n\nBolden continued:\n\nBorn in 1918, Johnson was drawn to math from a young age, leaving her West Virginia hometown to enroll in high school at the age of 10. She continued on to a mathematics major program at West Virginia State College by the age of 15, graduated summa cum laude at the age of 18, and taught math for a number of years. In 1953, when the predecessor to NASA, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, opened up hiring to African-Americans and women for the first time, Johnson was hired as a research mathematician.\n\nJohnson had a reputation at NASA for bucking the expectations that women were to do what they were told. Instead, Johnson showed confidence among men and boldly took initiative in her work. \u201cI asked questions. I wanted to know why,\u201d said Johnson in an interview with NASA. In calculating the trajectories of capsules along a parabola, \u201cI said, \u2018Let me do it. You tell me when you want it and where you want it to land, and I\u2019ll do it backwards and tell you when to take off.\u2019 That was my forte.\u201d\n\nSaid NASA Deputy Administrator Dava Newman in a statement:\n\nWe are all so fortunate that Katherine insisted on asking questions, and insisted on relentlessly pursuing answers. We are fortunate that when faced with the adversity of racial and gender barriers, she found the courage to say \u2018tell them I\u2019m coming.\u2019 We are also fortunate that Katherine has chosen to take a leading role in encouraging young people to pursue education in the STEM disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math.\n\nPhysics and mathematics continue to be central to Johnson\u2019s world\n\nCurrently a resident of Hampton, Virginia, Johnson often speaks to students about pursuing careers in STEM. At the age of 97, physics and mathematics remains the center of her world. \u201cThere will always, always be mathematics. Everything is physics and math,\u201d said Johnson.\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom is presented to \u201cindividuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\u201d The President himself selects the recipients with the assistance of senior White House staff, and his picks have been described as a very personal decision. Other awardees this year include former baseball player Yogi Berra, former representative Shirley Chisholm, pop music artists Gloria and Emilio Estefan, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), violinist Itzhak Perlman, theater composer Stephen Sondheim, movie director Steven Spielberg, actor and singer Barbra Streisand, and singer-songwriter James Taylor."}, {"url": "https://inews.co.uk/news/new-years-honours-list-2022-full-who-mbe-obe-cbe-knight-dame-difference-explained-1378053", "page_content": "The 2022 New Year\u2019s Honours list has been revealed, with recognition for everyone from Covid medical heroes and sports stars to James Bond.\n\nChris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer (CMO), and his deputy Jonathan Van-Tam both received knighthoods, as did Scotland\u2019s CMOs Frank Atherton and Dr Gregor Smith.\n\nJason and Laura Kenny received a knighthood and damehood respectively, and are thought to be the first married couple recognised on the same honours list.\n\nAside from Team GB\u2019s Olympic heroes, US Open-winning tennis ace Emma Raducanu was awarded an MBE, while Daniel Craig was given a special diplomatic honour after his final outing as Bond.\n\nAs always, though, beyond the famous faces were countless ordinary people recognised for their extraordinary contribution \u2013 here\u2019s the list in full, and what the different awards mean.\n\nWhat are the different types of honour?\n\nCompanions of Honour (CH)\n\nThe Order of the Companions of Honour was founded on June 4 1917 by George V and it limited to just 65 members at any one time.

It also goes to those who make a distinguished, innovative contribution to any area.\n\nOfficer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)\n\nPeople are made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire if they have a major local role in any activity, including people whose work has made them known nationally.\n\nMember of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)\n\nThis rank recognises outstanding achievements or service to the community which have had a long-term significant impact.\n\nBritish Empire Medal (BEM)\n\nThe BEM was reintroduced in 2012 by then prime minister David Cameron as part of his bid to make the honours system \u201cclassless\u201d, saying too few people making a difference in their areas were made MBEs.\n\nThe medal went to 361 people in the New Year Honours.\n\nThe 2022 New Year\u2019s Honours List in full\n\nORDER OF THE COMPANIONS OF HONOUR\n\nMembers of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH)\n\nLord Frank Field Of Birkenhead DL.

In addition to Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress (for Spencer), \"Hidden Figures\" was also passed over for Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie was based on the book of the same title by author Margot Lee Shetterly.\n\n\"Passengers,\" the Morten Tyldum-directed science fiction film about two people (Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt) who are awoken early on an interstellar trip to an exoplanet, had been nominated for Best Production Design and Best Original Score, but like \"Hidden Figures\" did not win.\n\n\"Arrival,\" the second highest-grossing Best Picture nominee, came away from the night having fared slightly better.

Here, meet the bright talents on this year's shortlist.\n\nZoe Cooper\n\nOut of Water, Orange Tree Theatre\n\nThe Other Richard\n\nWhat inspired you to write Out of Water?\n\nMy wife works in education. She told me about an incident at school, when Stonewall came to give a talk about homophobic bullying. The school were very enthusiastic about the talk, but later that day a pregnant head of department warned the staff who had attended not to tell anyone that she herself was in a same-sex partnership. I could understand why a teacher would feel this way, especially a woman who might already feel vulnerable because she was pregnant, and especially given her senior position. I decided to write about a teacher who lies about the gender of her partner when she starts a new job, and then can\u2019t find a way out of that lie. The consequences for her and her students.\n\nWhat\u2019s your best memory from the production at the Orange Tree?\n\nLots of the people involved in making the show were queer themselves, and so it was a lovely feeling to all be making a show together which centred some of our shared stories. My best memories come from these collaborator's contributions, a moment when an actor saw something of themselves in a character and in so doing helped me to see that character more clearly, or a stage manager questioned whether I had got the detail of the script right. Like lots of other minorities, queer women and non-binary people in particular rarely get to see ourselves on stage or screen, and when we do it is even rarer that we get to see ourselves in the role of the protagonist. I felt really privileged to be telling the story with all of them.\n\nWho are your biggest influences and inspirations?\n\nI have really diverse tastes in terms of theatre and playwrights, some of my favourites are Lucy Kirkwood, David Grieg, Tom Wells, Winsome Pinnock , Caroline Horton, Alan Ayckbourn, Annie Baker . Maybe what they have in common is that they are all tender writers, who are united in trying to understand why their characters do what they do, with compassion.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve seen this year?\n\nI was completely blown away by It\u2019s True, It\u2019s True, It\u2019s True by Breach Theatre. The story was so urgent, so beautifully staged and the performances were three of the best I have seen all year. I also absolutely loved Charley Miles play, There Are No Beginnings at Leeds Playhouse and Danusia Samal\u2019s Out of Sorts at Theatre503. All three plays tell really specific stories meticulously and again with compassion, and in doing so reveal bigger truths.\n\nWhat would you like to write about next?\n\nI want to write plays that are about the church, about women and poverty and pain, about elder care and the environment. I\u2019ve got lots of ideas, and some of them feel like they belong on bigger stages. Historically those bigger stages have been dominated by the of work canonical writers, who are more often than not white and male. This, in turn, has created its own assumptions: that white male work is \u2018bigger\u2019, or that \u2018bigger work\u2019 looks like things that white men write. However, I am hopeful that this is changing and that I and other writers like me (and not like me!) will get the chance to occupy those stages more frequently soon!\n\nYasmin Joseph\n\nJ'Ouvert, Theatre503\n\nHelen Murray\n\nWhat inspired you to write J\u2019Ouvert?\n\nJ'Ouvert is the official start of Caribbean carnival at dawn, and when I moved to New York in 2015 for an internship at the New York Theatre Workshop, it was the night before Labor Day - the city's annual West Indian Parade. The sound of soca music outside my building made me instantly feel at home and let me know that my community was nearby, so I went out to explore. A year later in 2016, I learned of a woman called Tiarah Poyau, shot and killed during J'Ouvert celebrations in Brooklyn, for declining the advances of a man she didn't want to dance with. I was really angry and thought a lot about what carnival means to me in this country, as a space to lay claim to my heritage, as a vital act of resistance and a way of pushing back against erasure. For me, black women are an integral part of the tradition, and I think J'Ouvert was my way of reconciling with how we're mistreated in the spaces that we pioneer.\n\nWhat\u2019s your best memory from the production at the Theatre503?\n\nCarnival itself is inherently theatrical, the energy is electric, literally millions of people pouring into the streets, dancing, releasing and presenting a heightened version of themselves. The audience felt like the final character in my play, the biggest test was how to effectively mirror this energy on stage. On the opening night I was terrified, but hearing the laughter, people singing, the nods and hums of agreement from elders, the call and response with people finishing off old Jamaican proverbs. I felt really proud and privileged to be documenting such a vital part of my history. Throughout the run it was generally just so special having chats with people after the show and hearing them say they felt celebrated and seen.\n\nWho are your biggest influences and inspirations?\n\nI draw inspiration from so many places and people. My family is full of storytellers, my best friends are riotous and some of the wittiest, sharpest women in the world. I listen to lots of music and can get ideas from anything from Headie One to Nina Simone. In terms of theatre artists, a uni tutor once highlighted that the way Arthur Miller uses language is really economical, nothing is wasted. That's why A View From A Bridge is one of my favourite plays. Almost every line in isolation packs a punch. debbie tucker green inspires me to trust my audiences, she uses words in a way that feels so intentional and specific, she dares us to keep up. Some other great minds that have influenced me this year have been Rebekah Murrell, Ross Willis, Lisa Spirling, Lucy Morrison, Milli Bhatia, Jane Fallowfield, Leo Butler and Gill Greer.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve seen this year?\n\nThis question's a bit impossible because there have been so many amazing shows - and also because I find it hard to remember stuff. Clean Break\u2019s [BLANK] by Alice Birch had a profound impact on me. It was so harrowing and humane. It just felt like a visceral portrayal of our flawed criminal justice system and the women that this country continues to fail. I always say that her work finds me exactly when I need it. It made me want to be a better human, it also reminded me how much I love my mum. Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train by Stephen Adly Guirgis was also incredible. I love work that pushes audiences to challenge their own concept of morality.\n\nWhat would you like to write about next?\n\nThe things that scare me and the things that give me hope. Things that examine the human condition and make us think and laugh. Stories that are political, timely and centre the experiences of black people, particularly in this country.\n\nJasmine Lee-Jones\n\nseven methods of killing kylie jenner, Royal Court\n\nHelen Murray\n\nWhat inspired you to write seven methods of killing kylie jenner?\n\nTo be honest, all of the young black womxn I\u2019ve grown up with. I was really fascinated by the spaces black womxn of my generation have carved out and curated on social media and how we have used the tangled web of the internet to create platforms to amplify our voices. Those two things combined made me want to write something with the onus on black womxn - particularly black womxn who are prominent on social media. Having the opportunity to hold up a mirror to their lives as a dramatist and, in doing so, pay homage to them has been a tremendous privilege.\n\nWhat\u2019s your best memory from the production at the Royal Court?\n\nThere are too many to pick from! What I remember distinctly is the sensation of relief - I went from a very intense, stressful period being at drama school and trying to stay up at night and write the play, to the warmth, calm and unity of our rehearsal room: it felt like stepping into heaven! There was a lot of laughter - it\u2019s a very silly play so Milli Bhatia (the director) did an amazing job of making sure we had lots of space to be silly in rehearsal. If I were to pick one memory from the production that was significant it would probably be when the young womxn from Treasure Tress\u2019 Teen Experience came to watch the play - talking to them after and hearing how boldly they lived in their truths moved me to tears. Treasure Tress are such an incredible organisation that offers spaces for young black womxn to congregate and communicate - everyone spread the word about them!\n\nWho are your biggest influences and inspirations?\n\nI have loads! I love the African-American artist Carrie Mae Weems - the political act of her placing her body in her art has really influenced my practice as an artist - I always like to place myself in my work in some way or another. In terms of people in my medium I have to say Michaela Coel, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and debbie tucker green - they all have incredible voices and talents whilst simultaneously having massive artistic integrity and not compromising their visions or instincts. My parents put me on to a lot of fantastic irreverent comedy from the 80\u2019s when I was younger like The Real McCoy and Oliver at Large, the latter of which starred Jamaican comic genius Oliver Samuels. Both of those shows\u2019 ingenuity and bravery has profoundly influenced the way I view humour and risk-taking as an actor and writer.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve seen this year?\n\nThis is cheating slightly because it\u2019s not theatre but let\u2019s just say I don\u2019t believe in the hierarchy of mediums! I think the thing that\u2019s moved me the most this year is Rocks at London Film Festival. It is a beautiful, beautiful film about coming-of-age and it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen a young British Black woman of secondary school age represented authentically on the big screen. The film brought out raw, truthful performances from a cast of generous actors. What a feat! I think all creators should aim to achieve that level of authenticity and genuine ensemble in their work.\n\nWhat would you like to write about next?\n\nThe next thing I write will be for myself to perform in. I\u2019m in the process of researching, writing and developing stories that I feel connected to as both an actor and a writer. Speaking more generally, I\u2019m keen to keep telling stories with black womxn as the protagonists and not necessarily in the ways we have been represented previously. While the confluence of our race and gender identity are factors in our lives and there should be space where those two factors are the centralised themes, I\u2019m really interested in telling stories where our race and gender identities are leitmotifs and our images and experiences can exist as the default. I feel like a lot of the time, even when I see us depicted on stage or on screen, we are still being othered because the centrality of whiteness and maleness is still being implied in the work. I want to use my voice to counter that.\n\n(Editor's note: The term 'womxn' is used as alternative word for 'woman' or 'women' to explicitly include transgender women and women of colour)\n\nRoss Willis\n\nWolfie, Theatre503\n\nHelen Murray\n\nWhat inspired you to write Wolfie?\n\nI wanted to write about how life during and after the care system feels. How it affects your sense of self at your very core and how those feelings of loneliness and isolation affect your transition into adulthood. Formally I didn\u2019t want Wolfie to feel domestic because I think there\u2019s nothing domestic about the care system at all.\n\nWhat\u2019s your best memory from the production at the Theatre503?\n\nI think anyone who watched the play on its own terms and just took it for what it was trying to do. Sometimes I find as an audience member it\u2019s a surprisingly hard thing to do.\n\nWho are your biggest influences and inspirations?\n\nDennis Kelly, Lisa Spirling, Lucy Morrison, Yasmin Joseph and Jules Haworth.\n\nWhat\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve seen this year?\n\nTristan Fynn-Aiduenu\u2019s production of Little Baby Jesus. It was a big f*** off maelstrom of electricity and fire which you felt in your bones. I hadn\u2019t seen a director create something like that in a long time. He filled every moment with a sense of wit and play. His energy as an artist is incredible. I\u2019m obsessed.\n\nWhat would you like to write about next?\n\nI\u2019m writing a play about queer history told through the eyes of STIs. Something which feels like Greek theatre featuring old beasts, myth, monsters and magic.\n\nThe 65th Evening Standard Theatre Awards, in association with Michael Kors, take place on November 24. standard.co.uk/theatreawards #ESTheatreAwards"}, {"url": "https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/inside-the-2019-evening-standard-awards", "page_content": "If all the world\u2019s a stage, does the reverse apply? In the traditionally exclusive milieu of London theater\u2014for decades overwhelmingly privileged and white\u2014what audiences see on the stage has not always fully reflected the world beyond it. At last night\u2019s Evening Standard Theatre Awards, however, an eclectic and diverse audience saw a cast of presenters, nominees, and winners who together comprised an ensemble emblematic of progress, positivity, and pluralism.\n\nLondon is (arguably) the greatest theater capital of all, in terms of both depth of history and consistency in innovation. Yet at last night\u2019s awards, cohosted by E.S. proprietor Evgeny Lebedev and Anna Wintour, one of the most rapturously applauded winners was a Brooklyn import. Double Pulitzer winner Lynn Nottage added the Chanel-sponsored Evening Standard best-play award to her roster of accolades thanks to the Lynette Linton\u2013directed Donmar Warehouse production of Sweat. Accepting her award from Olivia Colman, Nottage said, \u201cThis is such a glorious moment for me. Because I remember coming to London when I was 20 years old because I wanted to be a theater artist, and I survived on ramen bowls and porridge and I didn\u2019t starve to death. So to all of you up there\u2026\u201d At this point, wild cheering washed over Nottage\u2019s salute. Its source was the hundreds of drama students who filled the dress circle, upper circle, and balcony of the Coliseum, and who injected wave after wave of raw enthusiasm into the evening.\n\nFrom the start, master of ceremonies Cush Jumbo had us laughing, but also made a serious point when she observed that last night she became the first person of color to host these awards in its 64-year history. More positively, presenting the Charles Wintour Award for most-promising playwright, the super-producer Sonia Friedman noted, \u201cIn [the last] 10 years, nine women have won this award.\u201d The run continued when Friedman announced Jasmine Lee-Jones as this year\u2019s winner for her produced play Seven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner. Accepting her award, Lee-Jones paid tribute to Lorraine Hansberry and added, \u201cI think plays should be dangerous\u2026I want to urge the audience\u2026to allow artists to be dangerous. Especially those who have existed, like myself, outside the definitions of normality\u2026Seriously, I didn\u2019t think [my play] was going to happen. If I\u2019d walked into most theaters to say I wanted to write a play about two black women, half on the internet, half in real-life, with warring identities, speaking deep South London slang, most people would have laughed in my face.\u201d Happily, she added, the Royal Court Theatre\u2019s artistic director, Vicky Featherstone, embraced her pitch with gusto."}, {"url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/theatre/evening-standard-theatre-awards-winners-2019-a4294246.html", "page_content": "T he winners of the 65th Evening Standard Theatre Awards have been announced, with Maggie Smith and Andrew Scott given the top acting prizes.\n\nScott was awarded for his role in Noel Coward\u2019s Present Laughter at the Old Vic, while Smith took the trophy for one-woman play A German Life at the Bridge.

In Anna Ziegler\u2019s new play, Photograph 51, directed by Michael Grandage at the No\u00ebl Coward Theatre, Franklin was depicted as a woman who prided herself on always being right, her task made all the more difficult at being belittled by male colleagues and rivals who were for the most part arrogant and misogynistic.\n\nKidman\u2019s portrayal was without vanity or sentimentality, striding on stage in a white lab coat and brown lace-up shoes with sensible soles. Yet there was a glow behind her eyes when Franklin was getting close to discovering the secret of life.\n\nSeventeen years after she last appeared on the London stage, Kidman gave life and luminosity to a woman who had been overlooked by history.\n\nBaz Bamigboye\n\nBest Actor\n\nA virtuoso performance: James McAvoy in The Ruling Class Johan Persson / Johan Persson\n\nJames McAvoy in The Ruling Class\n\nWatching James McAvoy in The Ruling Class by Peter Barnes is rather like watching Liszt. It is a virtuoso performance. McAvoy plays a paranoid schizophrenic who thinks he is Jesus. He is both charming and alarming and his responses are quicksilver. As one of the judges put it: some of the great actors in this category were within their comfort range \u2014 McAvoy far exceeded his. This satire on the Establishment, exuberantly directed by Jamie Lloyd at Trafalgar Studios, with an unforgettable chorus of the Eton Boating Song, could be music hall, but McAvoy infuses it with Hamlet.\n\nSarah Sands\n\nBest Play\n\nMorally charged and ultimately hopeful: The Motherf**ker With the Hat Mark Douet / Mark Douet\n\nThe Motherf**ker with the Hat by Stephen Adly Guirgis\n\nThe title of Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s play has provoked plenty of discussion. But those two coy asterisks can\u2019t conceal the rowdy vitality of this New York story of poor judgments and blistering insults. Guirgis focuses on the struggles of Jackie, a former drug dealer just out of prison and trying hard to get his life back on track. The profound flaws of everyone he knows combine to make this a challenging process.\n\nGuirgis\u2019s writing has a lovely vibrancy, and he has serious things to say about infidelity, honour, friendship and addiction. In Indhu Rubasingham\u2019s impressive production at the National Theatre, this expletive-laden drama proved touching, morally charged and ultimately hopeful.\n\nHenry Hitchings\n\nBest Musical Performance\n\nMagnificently funny: Imelda Staunton Johan Persson / Johan Persson\n\nImelda Staunton in Gypsy\n\nImelda Staunton\u2019s Olivier-winning Sondheim triumph was as Mrs Lovett in Sweeney Todd in 2013. But this tops it. She hurtles at Mama Rose\u2019s crazed stage ambition for her children \u2014 furious, flirtatious, filling the Savoy\u2019s stage as if she was standing a foot in front of each of us, bending us to her will. She is magnificently funny at times, from the first eruption through the stalls clutching a lapdog, yet beneath the fizzing energy her consummate acting reveals Rose\u2019s vulnerability, envy, frustration and fear. Her stillness as she reads the letter telling her that Baby June has escaped her grip makes us hold our breath: when, like a heat-seeking missile, she turns to her dowdier daughter, crying, \u201cI made her \u2014 I will make you!\u201d, audiences audibly squeak with shock. It\u2019s a King Lear for musical actresses: nobody has done it better.\n\nLibby Purves\n\nHighlights from the ES Theatre Awards 2015\n\nEditor\u2019s Award in Partnership with The Ivy\n\nWinner: Vanessa Redgrave, who won Editor's Award in partnership with The Ivy with presenters Joely Richardson (L) and Ralph Fiennes Dave Benett / Dave Benett\n\nVanessa Redgrave\n\nIn a career spanning almost 60 years, Vanessa Redgrave has always been a fearless and passionate performer. She has proved an energetic Shakespearean, a mesmerising star of Ibsen and Chekhov and an emotionally shattering interpreter of Eugene O\u2019Neill, but has also injected playful humanity into more populist fare such as Driving Miss Daisy.\n\nOnstage, her style is fervently individual, and she has brought the same fiery urgency to her film roles and her work as a political campaigner. The result has been a remarkable haul of tributes, including an Oscar, a Tony, an Emmy, an Olivier and, with this year\u2019s trophy, five Evening Standard Theatre Awards. Acting is in her blood, yet she manages to seem at once an essential part of theatre royalty and a genuine outsider.\n\nHenry Hitchings\n\nBest Design\n\nA complete understanding of the play\u2019s tone: Anna Fleischle\u2019s design for Hangmen Simon Annand\u200b\n\nAnna Fleischle for Hangmen\n\nAnna Fleischle\u2019s inventive design for Martin McDonagh\u2019s Royal Court play about the last purveyors of capital punishment in Britain appropriately consisted of sets that were themselves measured for the drop, suddenly disappearing through a trapdoor to become somewhere else. The death-row cell of an English prison is instantly replaced by a period-perfect Lancashire pub in the Sixties, which, in turn, becomes the frame for a seaside caf\u00e9 hanging at the top of the stage.\n\nFaced with the demanding brief of creating three very different and detailed locations, Fleischle produced visual coups while showing a complete understanding of the play\u2019s tone of flamboyantly exaggerated realism.\n\nMark Lawson\n\nLebedev Award\n\nGenius: Stephen Sondheim Walter McBride/Getty Images / Walter McBride/Getty Images\n\nStephen Sondheim\n\nThis year alone we\u2019ve been able to witness Stephen Sondheim\u2019s genius in major productions of Sweeney Todd, Assassins and Gypsy. But any such sampling of his work fails to do justice to its variety. He is a witty and sophisticated lyricist who revels in subtext and irony. His scores are haunting and unpredictable, repeatedly challenging received ideas about the nature of musical theatre.\n\nA master craftsman who combines a talent for absorbingly dramatic songwriting with an appetite for grown-up ideas, he has won eight Grammy awards, eight Tony awards and even a Pulitzer Prize. To quote a popular joke: \u201cHas anyone ever seen God and Stephen Sondheim in the same room?\u201d\n\nHenry Hitchings\n\nEmerging Talent Award in Partnership with Burberry\n\nCrack comic timing: David Moorst Helen Maybanks / Helen Maybanks\n\nDavid Moorst for his performance in Violence and Son\n\nDavid Moorst made his stage debut at Hampstead Theatre last year in Wonderland, but it was as the teenage Liam in the Royal Court production of Gary Owen\u2019s Violence and Son that the recent Lamda graduate made an enduring impression.\n\nA bow tie-wearer with a fondness for Doctor Who and an uncommon articulacy that acts as both refuge and downfall, Liam remains a richly drawn character, and Moorst brought to rending life the contradictions of a man-child alive to both language and wit but as yet untutored in romance and the hard realities of life with a drunken, often violent father who goes by the telling nickname \u201cVile\u201d.\n\nBlessed with crack comic timing and the ability almost simultaneously to break your heart, Moorst\u2019s career-making performance here put me in mind of a young Eddie Redmayne while signalling a singular talent.\n\nMatt Wolf\n\nBeyond Theatre\n\nDazzling: Alexander McQueen retrospective, Savage Beauty Anthony Harvey/Getty Images / Anthony Harvey/Getty Images\n\nAlexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\n\nAnna Wintour, of American Vogue, famously said that fashion is theatre. It was never truer than of Alexander McQueen. The retrospective exhibition of his work first shown in New York was more potently understood in its staging at the V&A. McQueen was a London boy. As the show\u2019s curator, Professor Claire Wilcox, put it: \u201cLondon was at the heart of McQueen\u2019s world \u2026 his radical and fearless vision changed the way we look at fashion.\u201d McQueen\u2019s clothes became ever more recklessly dazzling and the designer\u2019s suicide inevitable. It could not have lasted but what a show.\n\nSarah Sands\n\nThe Evening Standard Theatre Awards 2015 1 / 60 The Evening Standard Theatre Awards 2015 Nicole Kidman, winner of Best Actress for \"Photograph 51\" at The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards in partnership with The Ivy at The Old Vic Theatre Dave Benett James McAvoy, winner of Best Actor for \"The Ruling Class\", and Gillian Anderson pose in front of the Winners Boards at The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards Dave Benett Nicole Kidman kisses husband Keith Urban as she celebrates winning the Best Actress award for \"Photograph 51\" Dave Benett Imelda Staunton stumbles as she collects her award for Best Musical Performance presented by Dame Shirley Bassey Dave Benett Kelly Brook attends the Evening Standard Theatre Awards at The Old Vic WireImage Pixie Lott David Fisher/Rex Gemma Arterton winner of the Newcomer in a Musical award, poses with presenters Jeremy Irvine and Gemma Chan i Dave Benett Award winners Sam Gainsbury, Nicholas Coleridge, Sarah Burton, Indhu Rubasingham, Vanessa Redgrave, Killian Donnelly, Nicole Kidman, Amy Lennox, Stephen Sondheim, Imelda Staunton, Gemma Arterton, (front L-R) Robert Icke, David Moorst, James McAvoy, Matt Henry and Evgeny Lebedev, Owner of The London Evening Standard, pose onstage at The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards Dave Benett Rob Brydon and Gillian Anderson attend a champagne reception at The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards Dave Benett Best Actress winner Nicole Kidman (L) and Best Actor winner James McAvoy Dave Benett Gemma Arterton and Ruth Wilson attend The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards after party Dave Benett Vanessa Redgrave and Joely Richardson attend The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards after party Dave Benett Evgeny Lebedev, Owner of The London Evening Standard and Nicole Kidman Dave Benett Party girl: Pixie Lott attends The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards after party Dave Benett Gillian Anderson poses on the red carpet as she arrives to attend the 61st London Evening Standard Theatre Awards AFP/Getty Images Kate Beckinsale arrives at The London Evening Standard Theatre Awards Dave Benett Salma Hayek David Fisher/Rex Pretty in Pink: Gemma Arterton David Fisher/Rex Richard E.

But no production was as unexpectedly thrilling as a new Oresteia from the director and adapter Robert Icke that transformed Aeschylus\u2019s time-honoured theatrical triptych into a compulsive, deeply contemporary meditation on humankind\u2019s ongoing thirst for retribution and vengeance.\n\nAn associate director at the Almeida, Icke saw his production transfer from Islington against the odds to an extended run in the West End \u2014 an unlikely destination on the face of it for a show running three-and-a-half hours. But time in the theatre is an ever-elastic entity, and rarely has an ostensibly long evening felt so sure-footed and fleet as a classic text leapt the centuries to reassert its bruising primacy entirely afresh.\n\nMatt Wolf\n\nCharles Wintour Award for Most Promising Playwright\n\nA sort of Lord of the Flies for the modern education system: Molly Davies's play God Bless the Child Manuel Harlan / Manuel Harlan\n\nMolly Davies for God Bless the Child\n\nA classroom of eight-year-olds is testing out, with possibly lucrative benefits to their school, a new government-approved teaching scheme, \u201cBadger Do Best\u201d, which aims to instil morality and discipline through fables about cartoon creatures. When one pupil leads a rebellion, the scheme\u2019s creator arrives to help the head to restore the new order.\n\nIn God Bless the Child at the Royal Court, Molly Davies created, through an atmosphere of ominous comedy and sharp characterisation of children and adults, a sort of Lord of the Flies for the modern education system in a play that also has broader relevance to other professions and institutions in which questionable new methods have been imposed from top-down. Whereas some dramatists are most comfortable with either words or images, Davies can vividly do both.\n\nMark Lawson\n\nNewcomer in a Musical\n\nCompelling viewing: Gemma Arterton Manuel Harlan / Manuel Harlan\n\nGemma Arterton for Made in Dagenham\n\nIn the song-and-dance adaptation of the Brit flick about the machinists at the Ford car plant who became heroines of the 1968 fight for equal pay, Gemma Arterton was faced with a difficult job description: proving her musical credentials in a big-budget production at the Adelphi while playing a woman who, at the start, lacks charisma and confidence.\n\nBut as Rita O\u2019Grady the actress succeeded in making a downtrodden wife and mother compelling viewing and listening before revealing the vocal and visual power of a full-blown diva in Rita\u2019s transformation at the Trade Unions Congress into a housewife superstar. Arterton\u2019s performance suggested that, like Sheridan Smith, she has the ability to take command of a stage whether speaking, singing or silently reacting.\n\nMark Lawson\n\nAnd your winner\u2026\n\nEvening Standard Radio 2 Audience Award for Best Musical\n\nAudience favourite: Kinky Boots Matt Crocke / Matt Crocke\n\nKinky Boots\n\nWhere to see the winners\n\nGypsy is at the Savoy until Saturday and will be screened on BBC4 over the Christmas season. Hangmen is at Wyndham\u2019s from Dec 1 to March 5, and Kinky Boots is at the Adelphi, booking to May 28.\n\nThe judges\n\nThis year\u2019s advisory judging panel comprised Daily Mail columnist Baz Bamigboye; London Evening Standard chief theatre critic, Henry Hitchings; Guardian culture writer and broadcaster Mark Lawson; Libby Purves, Times columnist and broadcaster; and Matt Wolf, London theatre critic of the International New York Times; alongside the London Evening Standard\u2019s editor, Sarah Sands.\n\nFollow Going Out on Facebook and on Twitter @ESgoingout"}, {"url": "https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/news-events/news/1648537200", "page_content": "The Department is pleased to announce that Professor Catherine Johnson has been awarded the Killam Research Prize, an award which recognizes the outstanding research contributions of faculty from across all disciplines. Prize recipients are celebrated for creating and disseminating knowledge that has a global impact.\n\nDr. Johnson\u2019s work is more than global, and focuses on the history and evolution of terrestrial planets \u2013 namely, Mercury, Mars and Venus. She uses remotely-sensed geophysical data to better understand the history and evolution of terrestrial planets, and has worked on several NASA planetary missions, including the Mars InSight mission and the Mercury MESSENGER mission. Her current work aims to understand the magnetic fields of Mercury and Mars, including when and why they formed, their current state, and how the fields interact with the solar wind. \u201cA huge unknown\u201d she explains, \u201cis the level to which magnetic fields protect a planet\u2019s atmosphere from space weather\u201d, a question with implications for human space exploration and habitability in this solar system and beyond.\n\nHer work also focuses on planetary evolution and internal structure, and what that means for current planetary seismic and volcanic activity. Dr. Johnson works with a wide range of remotely sensed data, including altimetry, radar and gravity measurements. Data is collected by lightweight, low-power, instruments specifically designed to resist the challenges of operating in space.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re required to be very creative, in a responsible way\u201d she says of the intrinsic limitations on data quality and availability. Leaps and bounds in instrument technology between missions means that new data can improve on in resolution by an order of magnitude or more, revealing in detail features that may have previously taken up only a handful of pixels. \u201cI love it; with each new mission to a planet or moon or asteroid you almost always see something unexpected.\u201d\n\nLooking forward, Professor Johnson is excited for multiple upcoming missions to Venus which will collect data on the composition and structure of the planet\u2019s atmosphere and surface. She plans to answer questions about Venus\u2019 suspected volcanic and tectonic activity using data previously shrouded from view by the planet\u2019s thick, toxic atmosphere. \u201cVenus was my first planet\u201d she says, referring to the geophysical work she did on the planet during her PhD and postdoctoral studies. \u201cIt is so different from the Earth in so many ways, but would look equally habitable to our planet from a galaxy away \u2013 why is that?\u201d\n\nThough not directly involved in the upcoming missions, Dr. Johnson will have access to the resulting publicly available data. With datasets so sparse and expensive to obtain, collaboration is a driving force in propelling the field of planetary science forward. She stresses the key role it has played in her research group\u2019s success: \u201cthis award is an honour, and it\u2019s not about me; its about the people who I\u2019ve had the privilege to work and collaborate with.\u201d\n\nProfessor Johnson (2nd from right) and recent research group members Megan Russell, Anna Mittelholz, Anna Grau, and Georgia Peterson at the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference"}, {"url": "https://finboroughtheatre.co.uk/production/the-catherine-johnson-award-for-best-play-2007/", "page_content": "The Pearson Playwrights\u2019 Scheme is delighted to announce the winner of the first Catherine Johnson Award for Best Play 2007.

Using 24 hours of footage from the fictional surveillance programme SATURNEYE, this is a disconcertingly intimate, unfiltered and impartial look into Laura\u2019s last hours before her death.\n\nThe 24-hour video file is only half of the story. To find the killer, users will have to immerse themselves in the characters\u2019 digital lives via their Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram profiles, looking for clues and motives seeded by our writers over months to help them identify the killer.\n\nKate Rowland, BBC Writersroom Creative Director, says: \"The project inspired by the Edward Snowden quote, 'I don\u2019t want to live in a world where everything that I say, everything I do, everyone I talk to, every expression of creativity, love or friendship, is recorded' challenges the traditional conventions of storytelling, and questions how we live our lives now.\"\n\nWith BBC development and support, this ambitious project has been a labour of love for the creative team behind it. The writers include Gabriel Bisset Smith, who also directs; Rachel Delahey, who plays Laura Kitchens; Kenny Emson; and Ed Sellek, working closely with producer Jon Davenport and Kate Rowland.\n\nThe Last Hours of Laura K will officially launch on 30 March. It\u2019s on this day that Saturneye\u2019s prototype media player is released to the world - it\u2019s on this day the hunt for 23 year-old Laura\u2019s killer truly begins.\n\nWith over 40 character profiles already live on social media, as well as an alternative newsblog SP117, the narrative threads are already there to be discovered. When and how the users consume and share the content is up to them.\n\nThe 24 hours of Laura\u2019s life was filmed over an extraordinary 16 days across London, from the Southbank to St Martins at Kings Cross, from Farringdon to Dalston by a small, dedicated team working with a set of step ladders and a bag of Go pros.\n\n#LasthoursofLK\n\nBiographies\n\nGabriel Bisset-Smith\n\nGabriel Bisset-Smith is an award-winning writer/actor/director/comedian.

The duo won from a shortlist which also included Bertie Carvel for Matilda the Musical and Charles Edwards for Much Ado About Nothing at Shakespeare's Globe.\n\nThe ceremony at London's Savoy Hotel on Sunday night, hosted by Dame Edna Everage, proved a successful one for the National, which received the most nominations and some significant wins.\n\nThey included Mike Leigh, who was named best director for Grief, his heartbreaking 1950s story of unhappiness and loneliness which was staged in the Cottesloe, the National's smallest auditorium.\n\nRichard Bean won the award for best play for two plays: One Man, Two Guvnors which was a huge success at the National and is now playing in the West End ahead of a transfer to Broadway in the spring; and The Heretic, which explored climate change, at the Royal Court last February.\n\nSheridan Smith was named best actress for her hugely moving performance as a brassy ex-barmaid waiting for her Polish count husband to return from wartime pilot duties in Terence Rattigan's Flare Path, directed by Trevor Nunn at the Theatre Royal Haymarket. The award adds to the Olivier she won earlier this year for her lead performance in the musical Legally Blonde. Smith won from a strong shortlist that also included Samantha Spiro, for Chicken Soup with Barley at the Royal Court, and Kristin Scott Thomas, for Betrayal at the Comedy.\n\nThomas was able to take some consolation after being given the Lebedev special award named after the Standard's Russian chairman Evgeny Lebedev. Stephen Fry presented the award, given \"in recognition that her appearance immediately turns a production into an event\".\n\nThe Milton Shulman prize for most promising newcomer provided something of a domestic drama as the shortlist included husband and wife Kyle Soller and Phoebe Fox, who met at RADA.\n\nSoller, an American, pipped it, winning for three performances in The Faith Machine at the Royal Court and The Glass Menagerie and Government Inspector, both at the Young Vic.\n\nThe Charles Wintour award for most promising playwright was won by Penelope Skinner for her play The Village Bike at the Royal Court, which starred Romala Garai as Becky, a pregnant wife desperate for sex.\n\nIt has been a mixed year for musicals with one of the shortlisted productions, Betty Blue Eyes, forced to close early because it couldn't get big enough audiences. The list also included the National's London Road and the winner, the Royal Shakespeare Company's Matilda the Musical, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's story by Dennis Kelly and comedian Tim Minchin which has transferred from Stratford-upon-Avon to the West End.\n\nThe best design prize went to a sound designer, Adam Cork, for his work on the Donmar Warehouse productions Anna Christie and King Lear.\n\nA new prize called the Beyond Theatre award was won by the collaboration between the band, the Pet Shop Boys, and Venezuelan choreographer Javier de Frutos for The Most Incredible Thing \u2013 a full length dance adaptation of the Hans Christian Andersen story \u2013 at Sadler's Wells.\n\nThere were two other special awards, one given to Michael Grandage who is stepping down after nine successful years at the Donmar Warehouse in London's Covent Garden, having extended what is a small theatre's reach into the West End and Broadway. Josie Rourke has taken over while Grandage is concentrating on a freelance career with his production of Evita opening on Broadway in the spring.\n\nAnd Tom Stoppard, whose adaptation of Anna Karenina is one of the most anticipated 2012 drama films, was given the Moscow Art Theatre's Golden Seagull for \"his contribution to Russian theatre and the international stage.\"\n\nThe Oliviers \u2013 to be held next April at the Royal Opera House \u2013 are regarded as the main event when it comes to UK theatre awards but the Evening Standard awards hold an important place in the calendar, not least through longevity, with Sunday night's ceremony being the 57th."}], "Catherine Johnson has been awarded the Critics' Circle Award for Most Promising Playwright.": [{"url": "https://playbill.com/article/2022-new-york-drama-critics-circle-awards-presented-may-20", "page_content": "This year's winners include Off-Broadway's A Case for the Existence of God and Kimberly Akimbo.\n\nWinners of this year's New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards will be honored in a private ceremony May 20 in Manhattan.

The Most Promising Playwright award is sponsored by Finito, The Employability Experts. The Peter Hepple Award for Best Musical went to Oklahoma!, an invigorating interpretation of Rogers & Hammerstein\u2019s classic re-orchestrated and reimagined for the 21st century. The musical was honored for its 2022 run at the Young Vic but has recently transferred to Wyndham\u2019s Theatre in London.

Although a household name as a best-selling novelist, Smith counted as a \u2018newcomer\u2019 for the Critics\u2019 Circle because The Wife of Willesden, a reimaging of Chaucer\u2019s Wife of Bath, is her debut play.

Igor Memic also won for a debut play, his heart-wrenching romance Old Bridge drawing upon Memic\u2019s personal history in its depiction of war- torn Bosnia.\n\nJames Graham\u2019s brilliant drama Best of Enemies won the Michael Billington award for Best New Play, an award renamed last year to mark the retirement of longstanding Guardian critic Michael Billington.

The National Theatre was celebrated, with critics citing its effort to broadcast theatre to the nation through the NT Live screenings, and the excellence of its filmed production of Romeo & Juliet, which also starred Jessie Buckley. Elsewhere, the Critics\u2019 Circle commended Jermyn Street Theatre for 15 Heroines, a series of filmed monologues using up-to- the-minute-tech to reimagine ancient poems by the Roman poet Ovid. The Old Vic was commended for its IN CAMERA season and the Original Theatre Company was commended as a pioneer in building new theatre steaming platforms. The Critics\u2019 Circle gave an individual award to Nimax CEO Nica Burns, who pioneered new forms of socially distanced theatre in her venues around the world.\n\nIn attendance at the ceremony were many of this year\u2019s winners, among them novelist and essayist Zadie Smith (The Wife of Willesden), actor Ben Daniels (The Normal Heart, The Exorcist), British actress and writer Cush Jumbo (Hamlet, The Good Wife), and British playwright and screenwriter James Graham (Best of Enemies, This House). They celebrated alongside awards presenters and guests, including actors Gethin Anthony (Game of Thrones; Aquarius), Tom Felton (Harry Potter), Kerry Fox(Shallow Grave), Harry Lloyd (Game of Thrones) and leading directors such as Rufus Norris (the National Theatre), Rupert Goold (the Almeida Theatre) and Lynette Linton (the Bush Theatre).\n\nAbout the Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Awards\n\nThe Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Awards, founded in 1989, are run by Drama Section of The Critics\u2019 Circle, which has existed since 1913 to protect and promote cultural criticism in the UK.\n\nSince the Awards\u2019 inception, the organisation\u2019s membership of professional theatre critics have prided themselves on offering something unique on the theatre awards circuit. Each member of the Drama Section independently casts their vote based on personal choice, free of any discussion or industry influence, ensuring a highly democratic voting process. These are the only awards judged exclusively by working theatre critics, whose job is to see everything that UK theatre has to offer."}, {"url": "https://www.theatre-news.com/news/UK/92936/Winners-announced-for-The-31st-Critics-Circle-Theatre-Awards", "page_content": "NEWS Winners announced for The 31st Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Awards Newsdesk Share with :\n\n\n\n\n\nRebecca Frecknall\u2019s electric Cabaret revival led the list of winners at the 31st Annual Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Awards, taking home three major awards at the Ham Yard Hotel ceremony on Sunday. Frecknall\u2019s acclaimed new staging of the 1966 musical \u2013 which stars Eddie Redmayne as the Emcee in his first role on the London stage in nearly a decade \u2013 won her the Best Director award. One week after attending the Academy Awards ceremony as a nominee, Redmayne\u2019s co-star Jessie Buckley was awarded Best Actress at the Critics\u2019 Circle for her astonishing performance as Sally Bowles, Cabaret\u2019s tuneless chanteuse. Tom Scutt\u2019s subtly sinister stage design won him the Best Designer award for the second year running, after he oversaw the Playhouse Theatre\u2019s transformation \u2013 auditorium and all \u2013 into Cabaret\u2019s Kit Kat Klub.\n\n\n\nBut in a shock twist at the end of the night, Rupert Goold\u2019s Spring Awakening revival scooped Cabaret to the final award, Best Musical. Between the two shows, it was a banner year for musicals, with Spring Awakening winning a pair of awards to become the Critics\u2019 Circle\u2019s second-most celebrated production of the night. Stuart Thompson was a joint winner of the Jack Tinker Award for Most Promising Newcomerfor his poignant performance as Moritz. He shared the award with Samuel Creasy, making his stage debut as the hero of the Bridge Theatre\u2019s adaptation of Phillip Pullman\u2019s cult novel, The Book of Dust - La Belle Sauvage.\n\n\n\nFor her fierce performance as the eponymous hero of Hamlet, directed by her long-term collaborator Greg Hersov, the Critics\u2019 Circle awarded Cush Jumbo the Trewin Award for Best Shakespearean Performance. The final prize for performance was awarded to Ben Daniels, who was named Best Actorfor his role as the defiant Ned Weeks in Dominic Cooke\u2019s new staging of Larry Kramer\u2019s The Normal Heart. A largely autobiographical account of Kramer\u2019s own experiences as the co-founder of an HIV advocacy group operating in the early years of the AIDs crisis, Cooke\u2019s revival marked 35 years since its UK premiere.\n\n\n\nThe awards come one week before London\u2019s Olivier Awards, in which Jessie Buckley, Cush Jumbo and Ben Daniels are all nominated for major acting awards. They now are even likelier prospects to triumph at next weekend\u2019s ceremony.\n\n\n\nZadie Smith and Igor Memic were named joint-winners of the Most Promising Playwright award. Although a household name as a best-selling novelist, Smith counted as a \u2018newcomer\u2019 for the Critics\u2019 Circle because The Wife of Willesden, a reimaging of Chaucer\u2019s Wife of Bath, is her debut play. Smith now adds her Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Award to an Orange Prize for Fiction, the Whitbread First Novel Award, and the James Tait Memorial Prize, amongst others. Igor Memic also won for a debut play, his heart-wrenching romance Old Bridge drawing upon Memic\u2019s personal history in its depiction of war-torn Bosnia.\n\n\n\nJames Graham\u2019s brilliant drama Best of Enemies won the Michael Billington award for Best New Play, an award renamed last year to mark the retirement of longstanding Guardian critic Michael Billington. Together with Jumbo\u2019s prize for Hamlet, this meant two prizes for London\u2019s Young Vic theatre.\n\n\n\nThe in-person ceremony marked the return of the Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Awards after the pandemic forced the organisation to skip a year\u2019s ceremony for the first time in its history. To mark this hiatus, the Critics\u2019 Circle created a one-off category of commendations for those \u201cwho went above and beyond to keep theatre alive\u201d during this period. The National Theatre was celebrated, with critics citing its effort to broadcast theatre to the nation through the NT Live screenings, and the excellence of its filmed production of Romeo & Juliet, which also starred Jessie Buckley. Elsewhere, the Critics\u2019 Circle commended Jermyn Street Theatre for 15 Heroines, a series of filmed monologues using up-to-the-minute-tech to reimagine ancient poems by the Roman poet Ovid. The Old Vic was commended for its IN CAMERA season and the Original Theatre Company was commended as a pioneer in building new theatre steaming platforms. The Critics\u2019 Circle gave an individual award to Nimax CEO Nica Burns, who pioneered new forms of socially distanced theatre in her venues around the world.\n\n\n\nIn attendance at the ceremony were many of this year\u2019s winners, among them novelist and essayist Zadie Smith (The Wife of Willesden), actor Ben Daniels (The Normal Heart, The Exorcist), British actress and writer Cush Jumbo (Hamlet, The Good Wife), and British playwright and screenwriter James Graham (Best of Enemies, This House). They celebrated alongside awards presenters and guests, including actors Gethin Anthony (Game of Thrones; Aquarius), Tom Felton (Harry Potter), Kerry Fox (Shallow Grave), Harry Lloyd(Game of Thrones) and leading directors such as Rufus Norris (the National Theatre), Rupert Goold (the Almeida Theatre) and Lynette Linton (the Bush Theatre).\n\n\n\nLIST OF WINNERS\n\nBest New Play (The Michael Billington Award) Best of Enemies\n\nBest Musical (The Peter Hepple Award) Spring Awakening\n\nBest Actor Ben Daniels (The Normal Heart)\n\nBest Actress Jessie Buckley (Cabaret)\n\nBest Shakespearean Performance (The Trewin Award) Cush Jumbo (Hamlet)\n\nBest Director Rebecca Frecknall (Cabaret)\n\nBest Designer Tom Scutt (Cabaret)\n\nMost Promising Playwright Zadie Smith (The Wife of Willesden)\n\nIgor Memic (Old Bridge)\n\nMost Promising Newcomer (The Jack Tinker Award) Stuart Thompson (Spring Awakening)\n\nSamuel Creasy (The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage)\n\n\n\nCommendations for Exceptional Theatre Making During Lockdown\n\nNational Theatre\n\nJermyn Street Theatre\n\nOriginal Theatre Company\n\nOld Vic\n\nNica Burns"}, {"url": "https://criticscircle.org.uk/the-critics-circle-theatre-awards-return/", "page_content": "The Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Awards Return\n\nThe Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Awards took a hiatus during the lockdowns of 2021, but returned on 3 April 2022 with a ceremony at the Ham Yard Hotel, honouring work made in the calendar year 2021.\n\nThe decision not to hold an awards, even virtually, in 2021 had been a difficult one, but in the end the overwhelming view of the members was that it would be wrong to celebrate or define parameters of excellence at a time when our friends in the industry were undergoing an existential trauma. Nonetheless, we wanted to acknowledge that many people had nonetheless managed extraordinary creative work in new forms during the lockdown periods, which is why this year we also included five commendations for organisations and individuals who went above and beyond to keep theatre alive during lockdown.\n\nSamuel Creasey (Most Promising Newcomer) Zadie Smith (Most Promising Playwright), Emma Keith and David Sabel (Exceptional Theatre Making During Lockdown), Igor Memic (Most Promising Playwright), Ben Daniels (Best Actor), Joanna Down and Harriet Mackie (Exceptional Theatre Making During Lockdown), Alastair Whatley (Exceptional Theatre Making During Lockdown), Rebecca Frecknall (Best Director), Nica Burns (Exceptional Theatre Making During Lockdown), James Graham (Best New Play), Cush Jumbo (Best Shakespearean Performance), Tom Littler, (Exceptional Theatre Making During Lockdown), Stuart Thompson (Most Promising Newcomer) and Rupert Goold (Best Musical) with Kate Maltby (Chair, Drama Section, Critics\u2019 Circle) at The Critics Circle Theatre Awards at The Ham Yard Hotel, London on 03 April 2022\n\nIt was clearly a year for musicals \u2013 Cabaret and Spring Awakening garnered the most awards, with Cabaret winning Best Director (Rebecca Frecknall), Best Director (Tom Scutt) and Best Actress (Jessie Buckley), but Spring Awakening pipping it to the post for Best Musical, as well as winning Stuart Thompson one of the day\u2019s two shared \u2018Most Promising Newcomer Awards\u2019.\n\nRupert Goold accepts the award for Best Musical for \u2018Spring Awakening\u2019 with Amara Okereke, Laurie Kynaston, Lynne Page, Stuart Thompson at The Critics Circle Theatre Awards at The Ham Yard Hotel, London on 03 April 2022\n\nVeteran novelist Zadie Smith also won her first drama award, as her debut play \u2018The Wife of Willesden\u2019 made her eligible for the Most Promising Playwright award. She shared it with Igor Memic, who was recognised for his memory play Old Bridge and gave a moving speech about the impact of war on his Bosnian family, urging us to \u2018make space\u2019 for the children of Odese and Mariopul to tell their own stories in theatre. Completing our set of playwrights was James Graham, awarded the Michael Billington Award for Best New Play for the Headlong/Young Vic production of Best of Enemies \u2013 an award presented by the Critics\u2019 Circle\u2019s own Michael Billington in person.\n\nJames Graham with Michael Billington award for Best New Play \u2018Best of Enemies\u2019 , Zadie Smith with her award for \u2018Most Promising Playwright\u2019 for The Wife of Willesden and Igor Memic with his award for \u2018Most Promising Playwright\u2019 for Old Bridge at The Critics Circle Theatre Awards at The Ham Yard Hotel, London on 03 April 2022\n\nCush Jumbo took the Trewin Award for Best Shakespearian Performance for Hamlet and Ben Daniels won Best Actor for The Normal Heart. In an exact tie with Stuart Thompson, Samuel Creasey was also awarded a Most Promising Newcomer award, for his role in The Book of Dust: La Belle Sauvage.\n\nWe awarded Commendations for Exceptional Theatre Making During Lockdown to Jermyn Street Theatre, Original Theatre Company, the National Theatre (particularly citing its NT Live screenings, the development of NT at Home, and the artistic excellence of Romeo & Juliet), OLD VIC: IN CAMERA. We also awarded an individual Commendation to Nica Burns, with the following citation;\n\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic first hit, most people in British theatre spent sleepless nights trying to work out how to save their own livelihoods. Our final Commendation today goes to someone who has made it her mission, from Day One, to invest in the survival of the rest of the industry, not merely the interests of her own businesses.\n\nFew people would have thought this the time to finance a \u2018Rising Stars\u2019 festival, but this person went ahead and gave 24 young producers their West End debuts, backing newcomers in the midst of a financial crisis. She was a pioneer of the creative thinking needed to stage socially distanced theatre, with trials across the world for her productions of Everyone\u2019s Talking About Jamie. She\u2019s been unafraid to put pressure on government in public and indefatigable in lobbying in private.\n\nSo, for her commitment to our industry, and her investment in the next generation\n\nThis Commendation for Exceptional Theatre Making During Lockdown goes to Nica Burns.\n\nWe were delighted that Joanne Davidson worked with us to take the beautiful photographs you see on this page."}, {"url": "https://www.bookcritics.org/awards/", "page_content": "Kelly Lytle Hern\u00e1ndez Bad Mexicans: Race, Empire, and Revolution in the Borderlands Norton\n\nJoseph Osmundson Virology: Essays for the Living, the Dead, and the Small Things in Between Norton\n\nAnnie Proulx Fen, Bog, & Swamp: A Short History of Peatland Destruction and Its Role in the Climate Crisis Scribner"}, {"url": "https://royalcourttheatre.com/jasmine-lee-jones-awarded-this-years-critics-circle-award-for-most-promising-playwright-for-seven-methods-of-killing-kylie-jenner/", "page_content": "Jasmine Lee-Jones has been awarded the 2019 Critics\u2019 Circle Theatre Award for Most Promising Playwright for her play seven methods of killing kylie jenner.\n\nseven methods of killing kylie jenner originally ran in the Royal Court Jerwood Theatre Upstairs Thursday 4 July 2019 \u2013 Saturday 27 July 2019.

Finalists for the Leonard Prize for best first book were also announced, determined by nominations from hundreds of the organization\u2019s regular members. Other announcements included the winner of the annual prize for a working book critic, a lifetime achievement award, and the inaugural Toni Morrison Achievement award for an institution.\n\n\n\nThe announcements, made by special guests Carlos Lozada, Morgan Parker, and Patrick Radden Keefe, followed a 30th anniversary celebration of the Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing. The program featured a discussion about the standards and craft of literary criticism with Balakian laureates Jo Livingstone, Daniel Mendelsohn, Parul Sehgal, and Katy Waldman, moderated by NBCC president David Varno. Nona Balakian (1918\u20131991) was a founder of the NBCC and an editor at the New York Times Sunday Book Review. Her nephew, poet Peter Balakian, noted in his remarks that his aunt \u201cfought for women writers at a time when women were often marginalized,\u201d noting her support for Virginia Woolf, Eudora Welty, Gwendolyn Brooks, Natalie Saurraute, and many others.\n\nThe National Book Critics Circle Awards, founded in 1974 at the Algonquin Hotel and considered among the most prestigious in American letters, are the sole prizes bestowed by a jury of working critics and book review editors. The awards for publishing year 2021 will be presented on March 17, 2022 via Wildbound Live, in a virtual ceremony that will be free and open to the public.\n\n\n\nThe recipient of the 2020 2021 Nona Balakian Citation for Excellence in Reviewing is Merve Emre. \u201cIn Emre\u2019s elegantly written essay about Leonora Carrington\u2019s The Hearing Trumpet,\u201d says prize committee chair Colette Bancroft, \u201cshe offers rich context about the life and times of the Surrealist author and artist, always weaving the biography into her insightful consideration of Carrington\u2019s novel.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe recipient of the Ivan Sandrof Lifetime Achievement Award is Percival Everett. \u201cThe Sandrof Life Achievement Award generally honors a literary figure who has either had a transformative impact upon book culture or who has contributed to book culture in ways that deserve more attention and recognition,\u201d says prize committee chair Jacob Appel. \u201cPercival Everett is the rare figure who merits the prize for both reasons. Profound and prolific, Everett isn\u2019t just brilliant\u2014but he is brilliant over and over and over again, novel after novel, story after story, each successively more original and thought-provoking. There are two kinds of readers in America: those who are reading Percival Everett and those who are missing out.\u201d\n\nThe Toni Morrison Achievement Award was established by the NBCC in 2021 to honor institutions that have made lasting and meaningful contributions to book culture, and it kicks off by honoring the Cave Canem Foundation. \u201cIt is fitting that the award is named after Morrison, herself an NBCC Award winner for fiction, who did so much to inspire and champion writers during her unparalleled career as an editor and Nobel Prize-winning author,\u201d says Appel, who also chaired this prize committee. \u201cIn naming Cave Canem as the first Morrison honoree, the NBCC has chosen an organization that embodies the deep commitment to literary and social justice, equity in publishing and excellence in writing that distinguished Morrison\u2019s career. Since its founding by Cornelius Eady and Toi Derricotte twenty-five years ago, Cave Canem has become both the premier body for cultivating and promoting Black poetic voices and has left a truly indelible mark on the broader literary landscape. No institution has played such a definitive role in shaping the poetry of the 21st century. Cave Canem consistently represents the best that the literary world has to offer.\u201d\n\nAUTOBIOGRAPHY\n\nHanif Abdurraqib, A Little Devil in America: Notes In Praise Of Black Performance (Random House)\n\nJeremy Atherton Lin, Gay Bar: Why We Went Out (Little, Brown)\n\nRodrigo Garcia, A Farewell To Gabo And Mercedes: A Son\u2019s Memoir (HarperVia)\n\nDoireann N\u00ed Ghr\u00edofa, A Ghost In the Throat (Biblioasis)\n\nAlbert Samaha, Concepcion: An Immigrant Family\u2019s Fortunes (Riverhead)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nSusan Bernofsky, Clairvoyant of the Small: The Life of Robert Walser (Yale University Press)\n\nKeisha N.

Comprising more than 600 working critics and book-review editors throughout the country, the NBCC annually bestows its awards in six categories, honoring the best books published in the past year in the United States. It is considered one of the most prestigious awards in the publishing industry. The finalists for the NBCC awards are nominated, evaluated, and selected by the 24-member board of directors, which consists of critics and editors from some of the country\u2019s leading print and online publications, as well as critics whose works appear in these publications.

Much missed was his joke about the taxman which has become like an old friend. Instead, there was a good new one about a Russian critic (why Russian?) who went to see a play that started at 7pm and went on to 11. About halfway through, he looked at his watch and was dismayed to see it was 7.20pm.\n\nThis ceremony is, of course, about celebrating those occasions when time flies rather than crawls. As the Standard awards increasingly chase glitz and glamour, it\u2019s these awards, voted for by the critics themselves, that give a truer picture of where the most exciting theatre can be found. Happily, a number of this year\u2019s winners have recently transferred to the West End and so can still be seen. Once again the Young Vic was dominant. Mark Strong, winner of the Best Actor award for \u2018A View from the Bridge\u2019 at the Young Vic, described how the play pulled him back into the theatre after so many years away, and also how discomforting it was to be told that they would perform in bare feet with no props. The director, Ivo van Hove, who denied Mark his shoes, was also a winner.\n\nHelen McCrory, winner of the Best Actress award for \u2018Medea\u2019, and Antony Sher, winner of the John and Wendy Trewin Award for Best Shakespearean Performance, both claimed they had to be persuaded to take on their roles. Helen told presenter Georgina Brown that she had been terrified of the role and was only convinced by her husband, Damian Lewis, that she could play a woman who murdered her children. Antony Sher said that he had never ever thought that he would be right for Falstaff. \u2018I realised I was being offered the greatest challenge for a character actor that there is, because I would have to change my body, voice, my whole inner energy to become him. So it became a great journey.\u2019\n\nPatsy Ferran, winner of the Jack Tinker Award for Most Promising Newcomer (other than a playwright) couldn\u2019t attend as she was performing in a matinee of \u2018Treasure Island\u2019 at the National, but Michael Coveney memorably described her as having \u2018witty elbows\u2019 when she appeared in \u2018Blithe Spriti\u2019, something not seen, claimed Michael, since Maggie Smith. Jonathan Kent, winner of the Peter Hepple Award for Best Musical for \u2018Gypsy\u2019, was surprised to discover a member of his cast serving drinks in the foyer.\n\nOut of all those either presenting or accepting awards, it was Dominic Cavendish who sprang the biggest surprise when he delivered a speech written entirely in iambic pentameters as a tribute to Mike Bartlett\u2019s \u2018King Charless lll\u2019. Not surprisingly, it left the playwright speechless. Here are Dominic\u2019s final verses:\n\nAt times a light capering jest and then\n\nAgain, some thought to sting the mind awake.\n\nWith craft and guile and insight he did ask:\n\nWhat will Britain be when Queen\u2019s reign will end\n\nAnd does the state a constitution need?\n\nTough questions wrapped in entertainment\u2019s garb.\n\nHe brought to utterance what deep lies hid.\n\nThose who have not yet seen this Charles the Third\n\nMust fly forthwith to Wyndhams here hard by.\n\nApplaud they will Tim Pigott-Smith et al\n\nAnd Rupert Goold, director most regal.\n\nPerformances sublime and without spite!\n\nBut lest you fear I almost did forget\n\nGood gentles all, I prithee clap Bartlett.\n\nFor Mike I would invite upon this stage\n\nTo take his due \u2013 he has amazed the age;\n\nAt least the Critics Circle, near as good.\n\nTush, tush, let us whoop a new writing god.\n\nIt made a terrific finish to the ceremony.\n\nMany thanks to our loyal sponsors Nyman Libson Paul and to the support given by Delfont Mackintosh Theatres.
