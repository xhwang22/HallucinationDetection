The motherless Philip and his three brothers saw little of their father, who, stricken by Isabella\u2019s death, threw himself into campaigning and administrative affairs. His troubled childhood and the series of blows he suffered explain in some measure the conflicting elements in his adult personality. In 1274 his father married Marie de Brabant, a beautiful and cultivated woman, and, with her arrival at court, intrigue began to flourish. In the same year, the two-year-old Joan, heiress of Champagne and Navarre, was welcomed as a refugee. Reared with the royal children, she would, when she was 12, become the bride of Philip the Fair.\n\nIn 1276 Philip\u2019s elder brother, Louis, died, and the shock of this event, which suddenly made Philip heir to the kingdom, was compounded by persistent rumours of poisoning and suspicions that Philip\u2019s stepmother intended to see Isabella\u2019s remaining sons destroyed. Vague allegations were circulated that Louis\u2019s death was linked with certain unspecified \u201cunnatural acts\u201d of his father. These rumours, never satisfactorily put to rest, together with the unexpected change in Philip\u2019s fortunes, apparently served to arouse in him feelings of insecurity and mistrust.\n\nConsequently, Philip turned elsewhere in search of a model for his own conduct. He found it in Louis IX, whose memory was increasingly venerated as the number of miracles attributed to him mounted. Reports of Louis\u2019s exacting standards of rulership and his saintly virtues were reinforced by the precepts of the religious advisers who surrounded the adolescent Philip. A more self-confident person might have been able to discriminate realistically among the sometimes artificially exaggerated stories and the utopian ideals. Philip, however, became convinced that it was his God-given duty to attain the lofty goals of his grandfather.\n\nBritannica Quiz Kings, Queens, and More Quiz\n\nWhen Philip was 16, he was knighted and married to Joan of Navarre. In 1285 he accompanied his father to the south on a campaign to install Philip\u2019s brother Charles on the throne of Aragon. He had no sympathy with the enterprise, however, which was backed by his stepmother and aimed against the king of Aragon, his late mother\u2019s brother. When his father died in October 1285, Philip immediately abandoned the venture."}, {"url": "https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-I-king-of-France", "page_content": "Philip I, (born 1052\u2014died July 29/30, 1108, Melun, France), king of France (1059\u20131108) who came to the throne at a time when the Capetian monarchy was extremely weak but who succeeded in enlarging the royal estates and treasury by a policy of devious alliances, the sale of his neutrality in the quarrels of powerful vassals, and the practice of simony on a huge scale.\n\nPhilip was the elder son of Henry I of France by his second wife, Anne of Kiev. Crowned at Reims in May 1059, he became sole king on his father\u2019s death in 1060; Baldwin V, count of Flanders, exercised the regency. Two years after he came of age in 1066, he obtained the county of G\u00e2tinais as the price of his neutrality in a family struggle over Anjou and thereby linked the royal possessions in Sens with those around Paris, Melun, and Orl\u00e9ans. His major efforts, however, were directed toward Normandy, in which from 1076 he supported Robert II Curthose, its ineffectual duke, first against Robert\u2019s father, King William I of England, then against Robert\u2019s brother, William II. Philip\u2019s true goal was to prevent emergence of a rival power in Normandy, for he was willing to abandon Robert whenever it seemed possible he might become dangerous.\n\nBecause of his firm determination to retain control over all appointments to ecclesiastical posts, which he blatantly sold, Philip was eventually drawn into conflict with the papacy, which nonetheless did not assume the disastrous proportions of the similar struggle over investitures in the Holy Roman Empire. This conflict was exacerbated by his matrimonial affairs; his scandalous \u201cmarriage\u201d with Bertrada de Montfort, wife of a vassal, brought him repeated excommunication. By 1107, when the French monarchy\u2019s struggle with the papacy was finally ended, Louis VI, Philip\u2019s son by his legitimate wife, Bertha, had taken over the administration of the kingdom, Philip having been rendered inactive by his extreme obesity."}, {"url": "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica/Philip_IV.,_king_of_France", "page_content": "\u200bPHILIP IV. (1268\u20131314), called \u201cle Bel\u201d or \u201cthe Fair,\u201d king of France, was the son of Philip III. and his wife, Isabella of Aragon. His reign, which began in October 1285, is one of the most momentous in the history of medieval Europe, yet it belongs rather to the history of France and to that of the papacy than to the biography of the king. Little is known of the personal part played by Philip in the events associated with his name, and later historians have been divided between the view which regards him as a handsome, lethargic nonentity and that which paints him as a master of statecraft who, under a veil of phlegmatic indifference and pious sentiment, masked an inflexible purpose, of which his ministers were but the spokesmen and executors. The first view seems to be borne out by the language of contemporary chroniclers. To his enemy, Bernard Saisset, he was neither man nor beast, but a statue, \u201cthe handsomest man in the world, but unable to do anything but stare fixedly at people without saying a word.\u201d Guillaume de Nogaret, his minister, draws a far more flattering picture, enlarging on his charm, his amiability, his modesty, his charity to all men, and his piety; and the traits of this over-coloured portrait are more or less repeated by Yves, a monk of St Denis. There is, however, no word of any qualities of will or initiative. All of which suggests a personality mentally and physically phlegmatic, a suggestion strengthened by the fact that Bartholomaeus de Neocastro (quoted by Wenck) describes him as corpulent in 1290.\n\nYet this was the king who with equal implacability brought the papacy under his yoke, carried out the destruction of the powerful order of the Temple, and laid the foundations of the national monarchy of France. In this last achievement Professor Finke finds the solution of a problem which Langlois had declared to be insoluble. In 1302, in the midst of a hostile assembly, Philip cursed his sons should they consent to hold the Crown of any one but God[1]; and in this isolated outburst he sees the key to his character. \u201cPhilip was not a man of violent initiative, the planner of daring and fateful operations, otherwise there \u200bwould have been some signs of it. His personality was that of a well-instructed, outwardly cold, because cool and calculating man, essentially receptive, afire for only one idea: the highest possible development of the French monarchy, internally and externally, as against both the secular powers and the Church. His merit was that he carried through this idea in spite of dangers to himself and to the state. A resolution once arrived at he carried out with iron obstinacy.\u201d Certainly he was no roi fain\u00e9ant. His courage at the battle of Mons-en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le was the admiration of friend and foe alike. It was against the advice of his tutor, Aegidius Colonna, that on coming to the throne he chose as his counsellors men of the legal class, and the names of his great ministers\u2014Guillaume de Nogaret, Enguerrand de Marigny, Pierre Flotte (d. 1302)\u2014attest the excellent quality of his judgment. He was, too, one of the few monarchs who have left to their successors reasoned programmes of reform for the state.\n\nThe new materials from the Aragonese archives, published by Finke, give the same general impression of \u201cuncanny\u201d reticence on Philip\u2019s part; when other contemporary kings would have spoken he keeps silence, allowing his ministers to speak for him. Isolated passages in some of the Aragonese letters included in the collection, however, throw a new light on contemporary estimate of his character, describing him as all-powerful, as \u201cpope and king and emperor in one person.\u201d[2]\n\nThe reign of Philip IV. is of peculiar interest, because Of the intrusion of economic problems into the spheres of national politics and even of religion. The increased cost of government and the growing wealth of the middle class, rather than the avarice of the king and the genius of his ministers, were responsible for the genesis and direction of the new order. The greatest event of the reign was the struggle with Pope Boniface VIII. (q.v.) The pope, in his opposition to the imposition of royal taxation upon the clergy, went so far in the bull Clericis laicos of 1296 as to forbid any lay authority to demand taxes from the clergy without his consent. When Philip retaliated by a decree forbidding the exportation of any coin from France, Boniface gave u ay to save the papal dues, and the bulls issued by him in 1297 uere a decided victory for the French king. Peace between the two potentates followed until 1301. After the arrest, by Philip\u2019s orders, of Bernard Saisset (q.v.), bishop of Pamiers, in that year, the quarrel flamed up again other causes of difference existed, and in 1302 the pope issued the bull U nam sanctam, one of the most extravagant of all statements of papal claims. To ensure the support of his people the king had called an assembly of the three estates of his kingdom at Paris in April 1302; then in the following year Guillaume de Nogaret seized the person of the pope at Anagni, an event immortalized by Dante. Boniface escaped from his captors only to die (October 11), and the short pontificate of his saintly successor, Benedict XI, was occupied in a vain effort to restore harmony to the Church. The conclave that met at Perugia on his death was divided between the partisans of the irreconcilable policy of Boniface VIII. and those of a policy of compromise with the new state theories represented by France. The election was ultimately determined by the diplomacy and the gold of Philip\u2019s agents, and the new pope, Clement V., was the weak-willed creature of the French king, to whom he owed the tiara. When in 1309 the pope installed himself at Avignon, the new relation of the papacy and the French monarchy was patent to the world. It was the beginning of the long \u201cBabylonish captivity\u201d of the popes The most notable of its first-fruits was the hideous persecution of the Templars (q.v.), which began with the sudden arrest of the members of the order in France in 1307, and ended with the suppression of the order by Pope Clement at the council of Vienne in 1313.\n\nIt is now tolerably clear that Philip\u2019s motives in this sinister proceeding were lack of money, and probably the deliberate wish to destroy a body which, with its privileged position and international financial and military organization, constituted a possible menace to the state. He had already persecuted and plundered the Jews and the Lombard bankers, and repeated recourse to the debasing of the coinage had led to a series of small risings But under his rule something was done towards systematizing the royal taxes, and, as in England. the financial needs of the king led to the association of the people in the work of government.\n\nIn 1294 Philip IV. attacked Edward I. of England, then busied with the Scottish War, and seized Guienne. Edward won over the counts of Bar and of Flanders, but they were defeated and he was obliged to make peace in 1297. Then the Flemish cities rose against the French royal officers, and utterly defeated the French army at Courtrai in 1302. The reign closed with the French position unimproved in Flanders, except for the transfer to Philip by Count Robert of Lille, Douai and Bethune, and their dependencies. Philip died on the 29th of November 1314. His wife was Jeanne, queen of Navarre (d. 1304), through whom that country passed under the rule of Philip on his marriage in 1284, three of his sons, Louis X., Philip V. and Charles IV., succeeded in turn to the throne of France, and a daughter, Isabella, married Edward II. of England."}], "Philip of France was known for his patronage of the arts.": [{"url": "https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/abstract/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0358.xml", "page_content": "Patronage of the Arts by Sally Hickson LAST MODIFIED: 27 June 2017\n\nDOI: 10.1093/obo/9780195399301-0358\n\nIntroduction Ever since Georgio Vasari\u2019s Lives of the Artists (1550, revised and enlarged 1568), the study of Renaissance art has been inextricably tied to the concept of patronage. The slow economic rebirth of Italy in the fifty years following the devastation of the 1348 plague resulted in a population shift from countryside to commune. In the new civic economy that resulted from the influx of the populace from country to city, wealthy merchants, craftsmen\u2019s guilds, and the burgeoning mendicant orders, as part of their administration of a growing urban clientele, commissioned and paid for civic buildings, churches, palaces, frescoes, statues, paintings, and hosts of luxury goods, all of them embodying the new humanistic ideals of individual greatness that had resulted in this new prosperity. The governance structures that supported and protected this economic growth\u2014aristocrats, guilds, and monastics\u2014used artistic patronage to reinforce social structures fundamental to civic sustainability: loyalty to family, church, and city/state. Kings, popes, princes, cardinals, poets, and humanists, as well as cathedrals, convents, and monasteries\u2014all sorts of patrons shaped Renaissance artistic culture by engaging artists to fulfill their commissions. A continual supply of patrons ensured a continual supply of artists and artistic workshops, and craft flourished. When Jacob Burckhardt wrote his formative social history of the Renaissance in 1860, he emphasized the role of the enlightened patron as the originator of Renaissance art. Patrons, through their ingenuity and growing apprehension of the virtues of Antiquity, and driven by the nobility of civic purpose inspired by ancient Rome, provided artists with hope and opportunity. In Vasari\u2019s view, artists actually gained much more through patronage than patrons did\u2014patronage was a social mechanism and economic engine that elevated the anonymous practices of mechanical crafts to the realm of the liberal arts. Through patronage, the Renaissance \u201crise of the individual\u201d elevated the artist to a new level of social and cultural importance.\n\nThe Patron\u2019s Patron: Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici Jacob Burckhardt (Burckhardt 2014, cited under General Overviews; first published in 1860) considered Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici the consummate \u201cRenaissance man\u201d because of his erudition, taste, and sponsorship of artists. While time and study have worked to extricate Lorenzo from works long attributed to his sponsorship (for example, Sandro Botticelli\u2019s Primavera and Birth of Venus), there is no doubt that Lorenzo\u2019s patronage activities were extraordinarily diverse and important. While his father, Cosimo de\u2019 Medici, was the true \u201carchitect\u201d of Medici cultural identity, commissioning Michelozzo di Bartolomeo to build the Medici Palace, Filippo Brunelleschi to design San Lorenzo and the Old Sacristy (and Donatello to decorate it), and Fra Angelico to fresco the monastery of San Marco (Ames-Lewis 1995), Lorenzo extended Medici influence to the creation of a host of luxury goods, from pietra dura vessels and vases to extraordinary engraved gems, and to the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the talents of Michelangelo (Fusco and Corti 2006). It was under the protection of Lorenzo that individual artists began to be credited with independent invenzione in the creation of their works, opening the door to the elevation of the artist from the status of medieval craftsman to individual practitioner of an art beyond the mechanical, embracing intellect and genius. Ultimately, Lorenzo\u2019s greatest legacy was his sponsorship of Michelangelo, who went on to paint the Sistine ceiling for Julius II in Rome, a monument to the startling inventiveness that resulted from the pairing of artist and patron.

Goldthwaite 2010 surveys patronage in the context of commerce, examining the economies of patronage within the larger context of an emergent European monetary system. Patronage was not only a system for demonstrating wealth, but it also created wealth, and the resulting market economy is theorized to have been the driving force of the Renaissance economic engine (Welch 2005). O\u2019Malley 2005 studies Renaissance contracts for works of art, revealing the intricate sequence of transactions forged between artists and patrons, and helping to quantify payments and costs. Artists actually earned only small profits from their works, since they were expected to bear all the costs of materials, labor, transport, and all aspects of production (including extended terms during which they were required to attend to repairs or repainting). The study of contracts provides further insight into the highly negotiated nature of art production under the patronage system and emphasizes the constant power struggles that underlay early modern artistic labor.

Find this resource:\n\n\n\nPatronage and Social Economies In the early 21st century, work on patronage has tended to focus equally both on the monetary and social economies of patronage. Far from being a disinterested act of exercising aesthetic preference or cultural acumen, the patronage of art was constituted equally by financial and social economies. The evolution of the patronage system depended on the constant negotiation and renegotiation of civic, corporate, social, and personal relationships and identities, through the commission, creation, purchase, ownership, and display of art objects and various other forms of material culture. In turn, these commercial and social exchanges negotiated identities, status, and reputation among the various agents involved, as in the signaling, signposting, and stretching described in Nelson and Zeckhauser 2008. While early scholarship tended to characterize patronage as a simple form of direct exchange\u2014that is, in terms of artists who \u201cworked for\u201d an aristocratic patron such as Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Federico da Montefeltro, or Isabella d\u2019Este\u2014these transactions were seldom so straightforward. Instead, they often took the form of negotiated forms of exchange among and between a network of intermediaries: humanists, artist-advisors, secretaries, and merchants, all of whom could play some role in determining the substance, creation, progress, completion, acceptance, and success of a commission. Further, the expanded field of patronage takes into account not just \u201cmajor\u201d works or \u201cmajor\u201d patrons, but the full scope of cultural sponsorship across classes and economies undertaken to signal identity and citizenship, as in Burke 2004.

Find this resource:\n\n\n\nPatronage and Intellectual Economies Allegorical and mythological works were particularly susceptible to negotiated forms of intellectual exchange, an important aspect of the patronage exchange for the period between private patrons and their artists. For example, when Isabella d\u2019Este, considered the greatest female patron of the early Renaissance, wished to obtain an allegorical painting from the painter Pietro Perugino, the program for the work was written by Paride da Ceresara. The resulting painting, therefore, had to satisfy not only Isabella, but the requirements of a program that, for a painter not steeped in allegory or mythological imagination, were so detailed as to overwhelm any spontaneous pictorial invention that might occur to him. Although Isabella accepted the final product, the Battle of Love and Chastity (1503, now in the Louvre), neither she nor the humanist who composed the program were at all satisfied with Perugino\u2019s efforts, although its general themes fit into the overall allegorical program contained in her studiolo (Campbell 2004). In the absence of such detailed written instructions for most mythological pictures of the Renaissance, we can only guess at the underlying subjects of various works, many of which were actually destined to be esoteric puzzles intended for decipherment among a closed social group (such as Giorgione\u2019s La Tempesta, made for Gabriele Vendramin in Venice and intended for his private collection, as discussed in Campbell 2003). In trying to fully comprehend the content of these mythologies, modern art historians are often working against the grain of spontaneous interpretation that informed both the creation and enjoyment of such works among a learned audience of viewers. A work such as Sandro Botticelli\u2019s Primavera (c. 1482, Uffizi), deliberately designed to be engaged with as a puzzle to be solved, probably has no definitive, final, or complete meaning. It is, in fact, sustained as a work of art through its ability to continually generate an endless series of possibilities (Dempsey 1992). This game of decipherment implies that contracts drawn up between artists and patrons were also forms of negotiated and sustained intellectual exchange and were valued as forms of social currency, not merely instructions for the creation of material objects.
