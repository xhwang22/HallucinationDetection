{"Alfred Fischer was arrested by the Gestapo.": [{"url": "https://www.archives.gov/iwg/research-papers/trial-of-war-criminals-before-imt.html", "page_content": "The Trial of the Major War Criminals.\n\nThe Allies also established an International Military Tribunal (IMT) to try 24 major Nazi war criminals and six groups.1 These groups, the Nazi leadership corps, the Reich Cabinet, the German General Staff and High Command, the SA (Sturmabteilung), the SS (Schutzstaffel-including the Sicherheitsdienst, or SD), and the Gestapo (Secret Police), had an aggregate membership exceeding two million and it was estimated that approximately half of them would be made liable for trial if the groups were convicted. The trials began in November, 1945 and on October 1, 1946, the IMT rendered its judgment on twenty-one top officials of the Third Reich. The IMT sentenced most of the accused to death or to extensive prison terms and acquitted three. The IMT also convicted three of the groups, the Nazi leadership corps, the SS (including the SD), and the Gestapo. Three groups were acquitted of collective war crimes charges, but this did not relieve individual members of those groups from conviction and punishment under the Denazification program. Members of the three convicted groups were subject to apprehension and trial as war criminals by the national, military, and occupation courts of the four allied powers. And, even though individual members of the convicted groups might be acquitted of war crimes, they still remained subject to trial under the Denazification program.\n\nWar Criminals Convicted by the IMT.\n\nBormann, Martin\n\nDonitz, Karl\n\nFrank, Hans\n\nFrick, Wilhelm\n\nFritzsche, Hans\n\nFunk, Walther\n\nGoering, Hermann\n\nHess, Rudolph\n\nJodl, Alfred\n\nKaltenbrunner, Ernst\n\nKeitel, Wilhelm\n\nKrupp, Gustav\n\nLey, Robert\n\nRaeder, Erich Rosenberg, Alfred\n\nSauckel, Fritz\n\nSchacht, Hjalmar\n\nSeyss-Inquart, Arthur\n\nSpeer, Albert\n\nStreicher, Julius\n\nvon Neurath, Konstantin\n\nvon Papen, Franz\n\nvon Schirach, Baldur\n\nvon Ribbentrop, Joachim\n\nTrials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals under Allied Control Council (ACC) Law No. 10, October 1946-April 1949.\n\n\n\nOriginally, a second international trial at Nuremberg was to have focused primarily on the activities of German finance and industry during the Third Reich. The so-called \"industrialists trial,\" was widely regard as of equal importance to the prosecution of the Nazi and SS high command. The United States vetoed this plan, declaring in the autumn of 1945 that it would refuse to participate in any further international trials and would hold separate prosecutions on its own. This led to the four-power, Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany to authorize each of the powers to hold subsequent trials on its own, in its zone of occupation.\n\nPursuant to this authority the Control Council adopted on December 20, 1945, Law No. 10. Based upon the same principals as those underlying the work of the IMT, the law defined \"war crimes\" and \"crimes against humanity\" and identified those who should be held responsible for such acts. 2 The law specified that any person who \"held a high political, civil, or military position in Germany or one of its Allies, cobelligerents or satellites or held a high position in the financial, industrial or economic life of any such country\" was deemed to have committed a crime against peace, namely planning and executing an aggressive war in violation of treaties. Thus, membership in an organization like the SS became sufficient cause for arrest. But Law No. 10 did not require that all persons considered as criminals be prosecuted; it simply gave the commanders of the occupation forces authority to bring charges as warranted .\n\nBased on the authority granted them by the ACC, the United States occupation authorities set about identifying additional war criminals to be tried in these subsequent trials. Eventually, 185 individuals were arraigned to stand trial as war criminals. They would be tried, beginning in October 1946, in twelve separate proceedings, grouped either by type of crime or by organization. These consisted of four cases in which the defendants belonged to various branches of the SS, officials of three industrial organizations (the Krupp works, I.G. Farben company, and the Flick combine), three cases of German generals, and two cases included mainly members of former German ministries. 177 stood trial (with four committing suicide and four being physically unable to stand trial). The last of the cases was completed in April. 1949.\n\nAfter taking into consideration the commutation of sentences ordered on January 31, 1951, by the United States High Commissioner for Germany, 13 defendants received the death penalty, eight were imprisoned for life, seventy-seven served terms of imprisonment, thirty-three were released on the basis of time already served, and one received a medical parole. Those that did not stand trial before war crimes trials were subject to Denazification trials.\n\nAltstoetter, Josef\n\nAmbros, Otto\n\nBaier, Hans Heinrich\n\nBarnickel, Paul\n\nBecker-Freyseng, Hermann\n\nBeiglboeck, Wilhelm\n\nBerger, Gottlob\n\nBiberstein, Ernst\n\nBlaskowitz, Johannes\n\nBlobel, Paul\n\nBlome, Kurt\n\nBlume, Walter\n\nBobermin, Hans\n\nBoehme, Franz\n\nBohle, Ernst Wilhelm\n\nBrack, Viktor\n\nBrandt, Rudolf\n\nBrandt, Karl\n\nBraune, Werner\n\nBrueckner, Heinz\n\nBrueggemann, Max\n\nBuergin, Ernst\n\nBuetefisch, Heinrich\n\nBurkart, Odilo\n\nCreutz, Rudolf\n\nCuhorst, Hermann\n\nDarr\u00e9, Richard Walther\n\nDehner, Ernst\n\nDietrich, Otto\n\nDuerrfeld, Walter\n\nEberhardt, Karl Adolf\n\nFerdinand\n\nEbner, Gregor\n\nEirenschmalz, Franz\n\nEngert, Karl\n\nFanslau, Heinz Karl\n\nFelmy, Helmuth\n\nFendler, Lothar\n\nFischer, Fritz\n\nFlick, Friedrich\n\nFoertsch, Hermann\n\nFrank, August\n\nGajewski, Fritz\n\nGattineau, Heinrich\n\nGebhardt, Karl\n\nGenzken, Karl\n\nGraf, Mathias\n\nGreifelt, Ulrich\n\nHaefliger, Paul\n\nHaensch, Walter\n\nHandloser, Siegfried\n\nHaussmann, Emil\n\nHildebrandt, Richard\n\nHoerlein, Heinrich\n\nHofmann, Otto\n\nHohberg, Hans\n\nHollidt, Karl\n\nHoth, Hermann\n\nHoudremont, Eduard\n\nHoven, Waldemar\n\nHuebner, Herbert\n\nIhn, Max Otto\n\nIlgner, Max\n\nJaehne, Friedrich\n\nJanssen, Friedrich Wilhelm\n\nJoel, Guenther\n\nJost, Heinz Kaletsch, Konrad\n\nKeppler, Wilhelm\n\nKiefer, Max\n\nKlingelh\u00f6fer, Waldemar\n\nKlein, Horst\n\nKlemm, Herbert\n\nKoerner, Paul\n\nKorschan, Heinrich Leo\n\nKrauch, Carl\n\nKuehne, Hans\n\nKugler, Hans\n\nKuntze, Walter\n\nKupke, Hans Albert Gustav\n\nLanz, Hubert\n\nLautenschlaeger, Carl\n\nLautz, Ernst\n\nLehmann, Werner Wilhelm Heinrich\n\nLehmann, Rudolph\n\nList, Wilhelm\n\nLoerner, Georg\n\nLoerner, Hans\n\nLoeser, Ewald Oskar Ludwig\n\nLorenz, Werner\n\nMann, Wilhelm\n\nMeissner, Otto\n\nMeyer-Hetling, Konrad\n\nMilch, Erhard\n\nMueller, Erich\n\nMummenthey, Karl\n\nMurgowsky, Joachim\n\nNaumann, Erich\n\nNebelung, Guenther\n\nNosske, Gustav\n\nOberheuser, Herta\n\nOeschey, Rudolf\n\nOhlendorf, Otto\n\nOster, Heinrich\n\nOtt, Adolf\n\nPetersen, Hans\n\nPfirsch, Karl Heinrich\n\nPlieger, Paul\n\nPohl, Oswald\n\nPokorny, Adolf\n\nPook, Hermann\n\nPoppendick, Helmut\n\nPuhl, Emil\n\nRasch, Otto\n\nRasche, Karl\n\nReinecke, Hermann\n\nReinhardt, Hans\n\nRendulic, Lothar\n\nRitter, Karl\n\nRomberg, Hans Wolfgang\n\nRose, Gerhard\n\nRostock, Paul\n\nRothaug, Oswald\n\nRothenberger, Curt\n\nRuehl, Felix\n\nRuff, Siegfried\n\nSandberger, Martin\n\nScheide, Rudolf\n\nSchellenberg, Walter\n\nSchlegelberger, Franz\n\nSchmitz, Hermann\n\nSchneider, Christian\n\nSchniewind, Otto Schroeder, Oskar\n\nSchubert, Heinz\n\nSchulz, Erwin\n\nSchwalm, Fritz\n\nSchwarzenberger, Otto\n\nSeibert, Willy\n\nSievers, Wolfram\n\nSix, Franz\n\nSollman, Max\n\nSommer, Karl\n\nSpeidel, Wilhelm\n\nSperrle, Hugo\n\nSteimle, Eugen\n\nSteinbrinck, Otto\n\nStrauch, Eduard\n\nStuckart, Wilhelm\n\nTer Meer, Fritz\n\nTerberger, Hermann\n\nTesch, Guenther\n\nTschentscher, Erwin\n\nVeesenmayer, Edmund\n\nViermetz, Inge\n\nVogt, Josef\n\nVolk, Leo\n\nvon B\u00fclow, Friedrich\n\nvon Ammon, Wilhem\n\nvon Leyser, Ernst\n\nvon Leeb, Wilhelm\n\nvon Geitner, Kurt\n\nvon Weizsaecker, Ernst\n\nvon Moyland, Gustav Adolf Steengracht\n\nvon Bohlen und Halbach, Alfried Felix Alwyn Krupp\n\nvon Radetzky, Waldemar\n\nvon Kuechler, Georg Karl Friedrich-Wilhelm\n\nvon Salmuth, Hans\n\nvon Erdmannsdorff, Otto\n\nvon Roques, Karl\n\nvon Weichs, Maximillian\n\nvon Knieriem, August\n\nvon Krosigk, Lutz Schwerin\n\nvon der Heyde, Erich\n\nvon Schnitzler, Georg\n\nWarlimont, Walter\n\nWeltz, Georg August\n\nWestphal, Carl\n\nWoehler, Otto\n\nWoermann, Ernst\n\nWurster, Carl\n\n1They were to be tried for crimes against peace; war crimes; and crimes against humanity.

Information relevant to the Acts is often found among files related to other subjects. In order to preserve the archival integrity of the files, the IWG and the National Archives and Records Administration, where possible, have released entire files together, not just those items related to Nazi or Japanese war criminals, crimes, persecution, and looted assets. These records may relate to persons who are war criminals, former Axis personnel who are not war criminals, victims of war crimes or persecution, or civilian or military personnel investigating Nazi activities; the records may also include mention of, or information about, persons having no connection to these activities.\n\nThe Heinrich Himmler Collection\n\nBoxes 5-8, 11, 13-17, 19, 19A, 20, 20A, 23-24, 24A, 25-30, 30A, 31. Location: 190/18/09/3\n\nThis series consists of various records prepared, collected, or received by the Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA, translated as 'Reich Central Security Department' or 'Reich Security Main Office'), an agency under the authority of Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS und Chef der Deutschen Polizei (Reich Leader of the SS and Chief of the German Police) Heinrich Himmler. The most significant characteristic of these records is that they were exempted by the Department of the Army from the general declassification and microfilming of other RSHA records during the 1960-62 period and retained as security-classified. They were systematically reviewed for declassification in 1976, when some materials were declassified and the remainder (comprising most of the collection) withdrawn for continued security classification. A small segment was separately reviewed and declassified in 1994, and was subsequently microfilmed and restituted in 1999 to the Bundesarchiv in Germany. All remaining materials were finally declassified by the Interagency Working Group (IWG) under the authority of the Nazi War Criminals Disclosure Act in 2000-01. In 2003 the two declassified segments were reintegrated and the original arrangement restored. Because the records formed part of the 'Himmler Collection,' the records described below are often colloquially identified as the 'Himmler Files,' though in fact they represent working papers maintained by the RSHA and bear little direct relation to Himmler's functions as Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS. This collection has not been previously described.\n\nThe RSHA was established by Himmler in September 1939 through the consolidation of the Sicherheitshauptamt (SHA) and the Sicherheitsdienst-Hauptamt (SD-HA), the culmination of a process of integrating State and Nazi Party police and domestic intelligence functions at the national level. Its records documented activities of the Gestapo and security police within Germany and occupied territories, the SD-Ausland foreign intelligence section, and the former Abwehr (German Armed Forces High Command, Intelligence/Counterintelligence Department), whose functions were eventually assumed by the RSHA. All of these materials were seized by U.S. military forces at the end of World War II.\n\nThe Department of the Army collectively designated the records of all SS organizations as Record Group 1010, Himmler Collection, and thereunder arranged the records by organization according to an improvised filing scheme devised but never implemented by German archival authorities known as the Einheits Akten Plan (EAP, translated as 'Unified Filing Scheme'). Under this scheme, records of the RSHA were designated as EAP 173 - b, with records of its subordinate offices and sections also designated by subordinate numbers: Thus, the record item designation EAP 173 - b - 16 - 05 identifies records of RSHA, Amt IV (Gestapo), Section Opposition and Sabotage. In some cases, where identification of record provenance is unclear, the EAP record item designations are more provisional in nature.\n\nThese EAP designations were retained by NARA as the record item numbers for these files when the captured German records were collectively accessioned as Record Group 242, the National Archives Collection of Foreign Records Seized, for later microfilming and restitution to the Bundesarchiv. Except for the records described here, the records of the RSHA and other Himmler staff organizations were microfilmed in 1960-61 as National Archives Microfilm Publication T175, Records of the Reich Leader of the SS and Chief of the German Police. Descriptions of microfilmed RSHA records are provided in Guide Nos. 39 and 81 of the Guides to German Records Microfilmed at Alexandria, Va. (99 vols.; Washington, DC: National Archives and Records Service/National Archives and Records Administration, 1956 - ). The original records restituted to the Bundesarchiv now comprise Bestand R 58, Reichssicherheithauptamt, and are described in Findb\u00fccher zu Best\u00e4nden des Bundesarchivs, Band 22 (Koblenz: Bundesarchiv, 1982).\n\nWhile the majority of the collection constitute original materials, in some cases (particularly for card files) only photostatic reproductions prepared by U.S. authorities remain; presumably the originals became integrated with American intelligence records or were otherwise lost or destroyed.\n\nAll questions regarding these and other relevant records likely to be in the custody of the National Archives and Records Administration should be directed to: Archives2reference@nara.gov\n\nBox No. 5\n\nThe nine folders in this box contain photostatic reproductions of an incomplete set of \"wanted\" lists with descriptions of known or suspected enemy agents prepared by the Staatspolizeileitstelle M\u00fcnster/Abt. III (\"Geheime Fahndungsliste\") on 28 October 1939. Each individual is described on one or two pages of standard-form entries that provide details on the suspect's name, date of birth, address, occupation, nationality, marital status, and other biographical information. In a few cases, a photograph of the individual is attached. The individuals listed are either German or Dutch nationals, and nearly all are identified as residing in the Netherlands. Each folder usually represents one alphabetical segment of suspects whose surnames begin with one letter (but thereunder unarranged) as follows:\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/10 (surnames beginning with the letter \"B\"), 56 pp.;\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 -05/13 (surnames beginning with the letter \"H\"), 55 pp.;\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/14 (mixture of surnames beginning with the letters \"K,\" \"P,\" \"S,\" \"W,\" and \"J\"), 109 pp.;\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/ 22 (surnames beginning with the letter \"Z\"), 11 pp.;\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/25 (surnames beginning with the letters \"N\" and \"O\"), 19 pp.;\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/26 (surnames beginning with the letter \"L\"), 21 pp.;\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - b -16 - 05/29 (surnames beginning with the letter \"G\"), 13 pp.;\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - b \u0096 16 - 05/30 (surnames beginning with the letter \"A\"), 7 pp.;\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/34 (a mixture of surnames beginning with the letters \"C,\" \"F\" and \"D,\" combined with separate files of the Staatspolizeileitstelle M\u00fcnster listing the known meeting places of enemy agents in the Netherlands, November 1939, and lists of pro-German Dutch nationals, May 1940), 52 pp.; and\n\n\n\nFolder 173 - e - 10 - 10/16 (surnames beginning with the letter \"R\"), 17 pp.\n\nBox No. 6\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/66: Folder apparently maintained by Gendarmerieposten Hallstatt (Reichsgau Oberdonau) containing original notifications and reports of the infiltration of named Allied and Soviet agents and saboteurs by parachute into Germany, 29 July 1942 - 25 July 1944, together with a notification of the Kommandeur der Sicherheitspolizei Dresden regarding a German agent, 7 April 1945; 39 pp.\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/68: Folder contains a report received by RSHA IV B (III F) from Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Norwegen regarding the interrogation of a captured British SAS (Special Air Service) officer on a sabotage mission in Norway, October 1944, with general information concerning the SAS and SOE (Special Operations Executive); 6 pp.\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 05/222: The majority of this folder, amounting to 56 pages, consisted of reports of Einsatzkommando 1/II Metz (subordinate to Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD in Lothringen-Saarpfalz) regarding Allied intelligence agents and networks in the area of Lorraine, 1940-43, which were filmed and restituted to the Bundesarchiv in October 1998. The present folder consists of several original documents withheld as security-classified items until declassified in 2000. These include a telegram regarding a mass escape of 46 British POWs from a POW camp in Hohensalza, March 1943, and a cover letter, report, and various attachments regarding British commando and sabotage schools and training centers in England, collectively dated September 1942 - July 1944; 26 pp.\n\nFolder 173 - b -16 - 10/4: Contains a copy of the printed \"Mitteilungsblatt der [RSHA] Gruppe IV E,\" Jahrgang 1943, Nr. 11 (15 November 1943), received by the Befehlshaber der Sipo und des SD Den Haag, containing names and biographical information on known or suspected Allied and Soviet agents and saboteurs; 12 pp.\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 10/14: Actually consists of two folders, the first containing collected telegrams and reports received by Befehlshaber der Sipo und des SD Den Haag concerning possible assassinations and terrorist actions by named Yugoslavian \u00e9migr\u00e9s alleged to be infiltrated into occupied Europe by Allied intelligence, March 1942 - March 1943 (9 pp.). The second folder consists of directives, notifications and reports received by the Gestapo office in K\u00f6ln from the RSHA, October 1940-November 1944, providing information regarding the equipment and training of Allied agents and saboteurs, including data on saboteur training facilities in England, definitions of Allied agents vs. combatant personnel, recommended questions in the interrogation of captured agents, telegrams providing names and physical descriptions of British agents parachuted into Germany, and reports of German personnel serving as Soviet agents. Some material is duplicated (134 pp.).\n\nBox No. 7\n\nThe 11 consecutive folders in this box (EAP 173 - b - 16 - 05/75 through - 05/85) consist of photostatic reproductions of card files regarding known or suspected Allied agents, 1939-44 (the series continues in Box No. 8). Apparently retained by the RSHA, some accompanying US documentation indicates that the originals were recovered from the Gestapo headquarters building in Copenhagen. The identified agents include German nationals and citizens of occupied Denmark and Norway and neutral Sweden, and summarize information on these individuals\u0092 business and espionage activities, general biographical data, contacts with Allied intelligence, membership in the Communist Party or international organizations, and where applicable their arrest by German authorities. Some photographs are also included. Much of the information is identified as originating with offices of the German Abwehr, and often include references to specific documents which were subsequently destroyed (\"Vorg\u00e4nge im Februar/M\u00e4rz 1944 vernichtet\"). The reproductions (each measuring ca. 8\u0094 x 7 \u00bc\u0094) were apparently made by Allied authorities, usually photocopying the front and reverse sides of cards together, although this is not always clear; some reproductions feature only one card. Some reproductions are annotated in English, usually partial translations of comments. There is unfortunately no arrangement to the names of the individuals documented in the collection, and there is no indication of the fate of the original cards. The collection appears related to similar card files reproduced on National Archives Microfilm Publication T84, Miscellaneous German Records, rolls 488-89. The approximate number of pages of reproductions for each folder is as follows:\n\n173 - b - 16 - 05/75: 79 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 - 05/76: 100 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 - 05/77: 99 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 - 05/78: 100 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 \u0096 05/79: 100 pp.\n\n173 \u0096 b - 16 - 05/80: 100 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 - 05/81: 100 pp.\n\n173 - b \u0096 16 - 05/82: 99 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 - 05/83: 98 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 - 05/84: 100 pp.\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 05/85: 95 pp. ( = total 1,070 pp.)\n\nBox No. 8\n\nThe nine folders (EAP 173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 05/86 through \u0096 05/94) in this box continue the series of photostatic reproductions of card files described in Box No. 7. The format and content of the folders remains the same. The approximate number of pages of reproductions for each folder is as follows:\n\n173 \u0096 b - 16 - 05/86: 104 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 - 05/87: 98 pp.\n\n173 - b - 16 \u0096 05/88: 100 pp.\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 05/89: 71 pp.\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 05/90: 98 pp. (and some accompanying US documentation)\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 05/91: 100 pp.\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 05/92: 100 pp.\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 05/93: 200 pp.\n\n173 \u0096 b - 16 - 05/94: 100 pp. ( = total 971 pp.)\n\nBox No. 11\n\nFifteen of the 16 folders in this box contain photostatic reproductions of broadly distributed \"wanted\" lists (\"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt\" through February 1940, thereafter \"Geheimes Sammel-Rundschreiben \u00fcber Landesverratsbek\u00e4mpfung\") for those individuals suspected of espionage, issued initially by the Gestapo\u0092s Abt. III and later by RSHA IV E, and received by the Staatspolizeistelle M\u00fcnster, July 1939 - December 1940. (This report series was terminated in December 1940.) Each list is arranged by nationality (e.g., French, British, Soviet Russian, Dutch) and thereunder by name of individual suspect, with a variable amount of biographical data for each of the latter, sometimes including photographs. The lists are sometimes supplemented by summaries of cases resolved (i.e., arrests of suspects from previous lists) or new reports of suspects for whom very little biographical data is available. Reports after February 1940 became more extensive, with information about enemy espionage methods, organization and missions, and names of German deserters. The reports appear to have been issued regularly on the 15th of each month. For several reports only excerpts are available, neither does the sequence of folder numbers correspond to the chronology of documentation. Additional reports in the series that complete the period June 1939-December 1940 are located in Box No. 13, described below, as are more complete copies of the reports here only excerpted; additional original copies are located in Folder VIII-173-b-18-12/24 in Box No. 19. The fate of the original documents is unknown, however several original copies are also found in Box No. 13. Dates and pagination for each folder are as follows:\n\n173 - b \u0096 16 \u009612/34: \"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 July 1939 (with additional information dated 10 August 1939), 21 pp.;\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/35: \"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 November 1939, 15 pp.;\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/41: \"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 September 1939, 18 pp.;\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/42: \"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 August 1939, 23 pp.;\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/43: \"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 December 1939, 18 pp.;\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/47: \"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 October 1939,\u0094 19 pp.;\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/48: \"Geheimes Sammel-Rundschreiben \u00fcber Landesverratsbek\u00e4mpfung,\" 15 October 1940, 13 pp. (out of 53 pp. original);\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/49: two pages excerpted from a \u0091wanted list\u0092 ca.

These include the cover letter for an Abwehr summary report on Soviet sabotage activities and methods, May 1939 (original), with a listing of known sabotage incidents aboard German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish merchant ships, November 1937-August 1938, and accompanying illustrations of sabotaged pieces of equipment on board these vessels (photostatic reproductions). The Abwehr summary report of 28 April 1939 (\"Lagebericht I \u0096 Sabotaget\u00e4tigkeit Sowjetrussland,\" 12 pp.), however, is missing: a security-classified withdrawal card remains in place, and the withdrawn item is listed among the contents of an envelope of withdrawn items subsequently declassified by the IWG, however that document was not in the envelope at the time the remaining items were reintegrated into the original files (October 2003). Volume of remaining contents of folder = 6 pp.\n\nBox No. 13\n\nThe first five folders in this box complete the series of Gestapo/RSHA \"wanted lists\" begun in Box No. 11. These also consist of photostatic reproductions rather than originals, were also received by the Staatspolizeistelle M\u00fcnster, and follow the same format and content as already described. The dates and pagination for each folder are as follows:\n\n173 \u0096 b - 16 - 12/70: \"Geheimes Sammel-Rundschreiben \u00fcber Landesverratsbek\u00e4mpfung,\" 15 April 1940, 12 pp. (out of ca. 21 pp. original);\n\n173 - b - 16 - 12/71: \"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 June 1939, 17 pp.;\n\n173 - b - 16 \u0096 12/74: \"Geheimes Sammel-Rundschreiben \u00fcber Landesverratsbek\u00e4mpfung,\" 15 September 1940, 29 pp. (out of 36 pp. original);\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/75: \"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\u0094 15 January 1940, 19 pp.; and\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/77: \"Geheimes Sammel-Rundschreiben \u00fcber Landesverratsbek\u00e4mpfung,\" 15 June 1940, 72 pp.(out of 82 pp. original).\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 12/90 contains original printed copies of eight of the same series of \"Geheimes Sammel-Rundschreiben \u00fcber Landesverratsbek\u00e4mpfung,\" here received by the Abwehrstelle in Wehrkreis IX (located in Kassel). These include some complete copies available only in excerpted form as listed above. The dates and pagination for each report in the folder are:\n\n15 March 1940, 22 pp. (complete);\n\n15 May 1940, 45 pp. (complete);\n\n15 June 1940, 80 pp.;\n\n15 July 1940, 45 pp. (complete);\n\n15 August 1940, 19 pp. (complete);\n\n15 September 1940, 37 pp. (complete);\n\n15 October 1940, 52 pp. (complete, including a translation of a captured French document on the use of double agents in espionage); and\n\n15 November 1940, 17 pp. (complete)\n\nFolder 173 - b \u0096 16 \u0096 12/98a: Consists of an original file of excerpts from reports issued by the RSHA IV E, \"Mitteilungsblatt der Gruppe IV E,\" that pertain to espionage activities by Polish intelligence, as received by Sicherheitspolizei Einsatzkommando 1/II Metz during the period May1943 \u0096 April 1944. The \"Mitteilungsblatt der Gruppe IV E\" apparently represented a successor to the report series \"Geheimes Sammel-Rundschreiben \u00fcber Landesverratsbek\u00e4mpfung\" also issued by RSHA IV E in 1940 and described above. The excerpts derive from the German discovery in 1942 of the continued existence of a Polish intelligence service in occupied Poland. The material includes names of identified Polish agents, data on the organization of Polish intelligence, periodic information on Polish intelligence missions and priorities, and copies of military and economic intelligence summaries collected by Polish intelligence (e.g., estimates of German casualties suffered in Russia, naval construction, industrial production, morale) all for the general period autumn 1941 \u0096 spring 1943. At the end of the folder is a small amount of information regarding identified British intelligence agents, equipment, and methods, May-July 1943. (83 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 \u0096 b - 16 - 12/100a: This is an original file documenting the case of a German merchant seaman arrested as an Allied agent in March 1945. Included is a statement by the individual regarding his personal history, recruitment by Allied intelligence, and information on his sabotage mission in Germany, together with reports by German authorities as to his arrest and contacts, March - April 1945. (34 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 12/126: The folder contains negative photostatic reproductions of several statements by a captured Soviet female agent regarding her activities for the NKVD. The documents were prepared by RSHA IV E 1 during the period December 1942 - March 1943 (recipient unknown). The agent\u0092s described activities cover the period 1938 \u0096 October 1942 and range over operations in Paris, in Finland during the Russo-Finnish War, the interrogation of captured German military personnel in 1941, and as an agent behind German lines in the occupied Ukraine and Poland, 1941-42. In addition to descriptions of her activities, the statements describe some intelligence training and methods and identify various other Soviet intelligence agents and NKVD officers. (49 pp.)\n\nBox Nos. 14 \u0096 17\n\nThe contents of these boxes, also labeled as EAP 173 \u0096 b - 16 -12/Boxes 1-4, consisted of card files for approximately 1,300 individuals who served as actual or potential informants for German intelligence. These card files, however, were declassified ca. 1996 (per declassification authority NND 968026), reboxed, and placed in a new location in Stack 190, although the withdrawal cards were not removed from these boxes. The card files were then filmed, together with other declassified RSHA card files, on Microfilm Publication T84, Miscellaneous German Records Collection, roll 489, beginning frame 0001. The originals were restituted to the Bundesarchiv in October 1998.\n\nBox No. 19\n\nFolder 173 - b - 18 - 12/24: Consists of original copies of three of the \"wanted\" lists already described in Box Nos. 11 and 13. These were received by the Abwehrstelle of Wehrkreis IX and sometimes include additional material than the reports listed earlier. The titles, dates and pagination for each are as follows:\n\n\"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 January 1940, 17 pp.;\n\n\"Geheimes Fahndungsblatt,\" 15 February 1940, 17 pp.;\n\n\"Geheimes Sammel-Rundschreiben \u00fcber Landesverratsbek\u00e4mpfung,\" 15 April 1940, 17 pp.\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20 - 05/03 through - 05/05: Each of these three folders contains numerous reports of British training centers and specialized schools for espionage, sabotage, and commando operations; collectively their contents should be viewed as a single entity. Also included are scattered reports f or similar establishments in the U.S.S.R. and elsewhere. The provenance is not indicated (presumably RSHA), and internal evidence indicates that the reports were compiled ca. November 1944. The probable original arrangement followed categories of training schools and thereunder by specific school, but now within each folder the reports are simply arranged by specific school or training center; categories include general espionage schools and specialized schools for radio communications, sabotage, parachuting, infantry weapons, glider, and naval demolitions. Each report includes a report cover, one or two pages of text detail the school\u0092s name, geographic location, the courses offered, names and physical descriptions of instructors, nationalities of students, typical course lengths and numbers of students, and the effective date of the information. Some reports also include names and descriptions of agents being trained (particularly Norwegians). Often the reports are accompanied by maps or sketches, and sometimes by excerpted interrogations of captured agents. In some cases the instructors are identified as German deserters or cooperative POWs. There is some duplication of material, and a number of pages are in poor or damaged physical condition.\n\nThe number of reports and pagination for each folder are as follows:\n\n173 - b - 20 - 05/03: This folder includes an alphabetical index by geographic location to schools in Britain, nine summary reports on different categories of training schools, 16 reports on specific schools in Britain, and one report on a Soviet school in Murmansk (total 177 pp. plus 27 report covers).\n\n\n\n\n\n173 - b - 20 - 05/04: Folder includes 32 reports on specialized schools and training centers in Britain (total 72 pp. plus 32 report covers).\n\n\n\n\n\n173 - b - 20 - 05/05: Folder includes two alphabetical listings of British training centers and specialized schools for espionage agents and saboteurs throughout England and Scotland, and individual reports on 23 schools and training centers in Britain, one Soviet center in the Caucasus, two in Italy, one in Palestine, and one in Algeria (total 54 pp. plus 30 report covers).\n\nBox No. 19a\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20 - 05/6: Consists of a collection of communications instructions and cipher sheets for communications of agents placed behind enemy lines in the Balkans, November 1944-April 1945, as maintained by 'Leitstelle II S\u00fcdost f\u00fcr Frontaufkl\u00e4rung' (a former Abwehr office under RSHA jurisdiction by that point in the war). The material is arranged by agent condename (e.g., \"Bello,\" \"Prinz Eugen,\" \"Stuna,\" \"Nero\") and includes references to Bulgarian- and Romanian-language transmissions, weather reports, times and lengths of transmissions, designations of radio frequencies, and in some cases information regarding the parachuting of the agent into a specific area. A few pages constitute photostatic reproductions, all the rest are originals, in some cases in poor condition. (142 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20 - 12/1: Constitutes the first of several files maintained by the RSHA's Amt VI B (SD-Ausland) regarding British espionage networks, contacts and sources in Yugoslavia and general intelligence information on that country for the period January 1939 - March 1941, with a few additional reports from April 1945 (most, however, are dated November 1939 - April 1940). Arranged in reverse chronological order, the file includes reports, correspondence, telegrams and press clippings that identify known or alleged British intelligence personnel, agents, and organizations and describe pro-British intelligence or propaganda activities in Yugoslavia, especially Slovenia and Croatia. From the SD-Ausland perspective, the file documents British intelligence\u0092s penetration of Yugoslavia as the background to later German invasion. At the beginning of the file is some unrelated 1933 correspondence of the American consul in Zagreb.\n\nThere is some duplication of materials. This is apparently the initial segment of a series that continues with Folders VIII - 173 - b - 20 - 12/2 through \u0096 12/4 in Box Nos. 20 and 20a. (252 pp.)\n\nBox No. 20\n\nThe two folders in this box, VIII - 173 - b - 20 - 12/2 through -12/3, continue the RSHA's Amt VI B (SD-Ausland) collection of raw intelligence information on Yugoslavia begun in 173 - b \u0096 20 \u0096 12/1 (Box No. 19a). They comprise correspondence, reports, telegrams, press clippings and summaries of press articles, brochures, propaganda leaflets, and translations of published laws and ordinances regarding internal conditions, political attitudes, and morale within Yugoslavia in 1940, particularly the influence and activities there of pro-Allied, pro-Soviet and anti-German groups and individuals. In contrast to the first folder already described, where documentation focused on the role of British intelligence, these folders provide a more general view of German perceptions of hostile influences and anti-German sentiment within Yugoslavia, including questions of foreign trade and business relationships. Many records consist of half-sheet cover notes or summaries of documents, most of which have been arranged for filming as two half-sheets per image. In some cases only a cover note is included, with a notation that the accompanying report or correspondence has been forwarded to another office. Some material is in Russian or Serbo-Croatian. Many reports are signed by codenumber of the German agent making the report (e.g., 6625, 6666). Each folder is arranged in reverse chronological order. The dates, general and noteworthy topics documented, and pagination for each folder are as follows:\n\n173 \u0096 b \u0096 20 \u0096 12/2: Covers the period 2 July \u0096 29 October 1940, and includes reports on the treatment of ethnic Germans in Serbia, announcements and assessments of persons appointed to government posts, arrests of real or suspected German intelligence agents by Yugoslav authorities, data on Freemasons and Jews in Yugoslavia, information on activities of and reports by German agents in the country, and the proposed \u0091bugging\u0092 of telephone lines in the British and Soviet Embassies in Belgrade (total volume 622 microfilm images)\n\n173 \u0096 b \u009620 \u009612/3: Covers the period 2 May \u0096 29 June 1940, and includes reports of arrests of ethnic Germans suspected of espionage, National Socialist influence within the ethnic German community, violent incidents between ethnic Germans and Serbs, Yugoslav reactions to Italy\u0092s entry into the war, activities of British and French agents, military intelligence data on locations and movements of Yugoslav forces, information on suspected Yugoslav espionage agents in Germany, information and assessments of key Yugoslavian political figures, allegations that the Berlin Philharmonic was smuggling weapons into Belgrade while on tour, and decoded British classified telegrams; also included is detailed documentation on the case of a convicted German national (for privacy reasons his name has been removed from the photocopies used in microfilming) residing in Yugoslavia offering his services as a double agent in return for a pardon (total volume 359 microfilm images).\n\nThe final folder in this series is located in Box No. 20a.\n\nBox No. 20a\n\nThe only folder in this box, originally located in Box No. 20, constitutes the last in the series begun in Box 19a, a collection of the RSHA's Amt VI B (SD-Ausland) correspondence on intelligence, counterintelligence, and internal conditions in Yugoslavia, and is also arranged in reverse chronological order.\n\n173 - b - 20 - 12/4: Covers the period 17 January - 5 May 1940 (except for one December 1938 document assessing Yugoslavia\u0092s requirements and dependence on petroleum supplies), and includes reports of identifications and activities of British and French agents, Allied other anti-German influences in the country, conditions and treatment of ethnic Germans, proposed voting reform legislation, anti-Semitic propaganda, Yugoslav military preparations for war, identifications of German agents, activities of Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and copies of anti-German leaflets (total volume = 368 microfilm images).\n\nBox No. 23\n\n(Note: The contents of Box Nos. 23-26, Folders 173 \u0096 b \u0096 20/2 through \u0096 20 \u0096 16/5, appear to represent interrelated collections of card files for ca. 3,700 French nationals and ca. 1,100 \u0096 1,200 individuals of other nationalities arrested in occupied France for espionage or resistance activities, 1940-44) Folder 173 - b - 20/2: Consists of photostatic reproductions of card files apparently maintained or prepared by either RSHA Amt IV E or Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei (BdS) Paris/Amt IV E, regarding known or suspected agents of Soviet intelligence residing in occupied France, 1941-44. Each card includes entries for the individual\u0092s name, address, place and date of birth, occupation, marital/family status, nationality, religion, a summary of the agent\u0092s known or suspected activities and/or a record of his arrest, and the date of the card\u0092s preparation. For a few agents, the summaries of their activities required two cards. Most of the individuals had been arrested or captured, also noted in the activity summaries. There is no apparent arrangement to the cards; the dates of information prepared range from February 1941 to January 1944. Each reproduction measures 8\u0094 x 6 \u00bd.\u0094 A similar but more extensive collection for French nationals, using the same informational and physical format, follows. (49 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 \u0096 b - 20/11: The first of several folders of photostatic reproductions of card files apparently prepared or maintained by RSHA Amt IV E or by BdS/Paris/Amt IV E regarding French nationals identified and usually apprehended for espionage or other resistance activities, 1940-44 (continued in Box No. 24). Following the same informational and physical format as that provided in the card files described above, these card files are arranged alphabetically by surname and include cards for those individuals whose surnames begin with the letters \"A\" through \"F\" (those beginning with the letter \u0093B\u0094 are only grouped together and not thereunder alphabetically arranged) and some with the letter \"G.\" The dates of information prepared range from July 1940 to April 1944. In some cases, the summaries of activities note individual agents\u0092 direct involvement with British intelligence. The amount of information varies according to the individual, and for many the only summary of activity provided is the date of their arrest. Many reproductions are of very poor quality, and microfilm copies of these will be partially or wholly illegible. The contents of the folder continue into Box No. 24 and other card files in the series continue into Box No. 24a; altogether the number of French nationals covered by these series (173-b-20/11 and -20/12) amount to ca. 3,700 individuals. (1,582 pp.)\n\nBox No. 24\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20/11 (continued): Additional photostatic reproductions of card files prepared or maintained by RSHA Amt IV E or by BdS/Paris/Amt IV E regarding French nationals identified and usually apprehended for espionage or other resistance activities, 1940-44. Following the same informational and physical format as that described above, these reproductions of card files are grouped alphabetically by the first letter of the surname (thereunder unarranged) for French nationals whose surnames begin with the letters \"G,\" \"H,\" \"L,\" \"N,\" \"O,\" \"P\" and \"R\" (cards for additional \"H\" and \"L\" surnames are located in folder VIII - 173 - b - 20/12 in Box No. 24a). One reproduction of a card file among the \"G\" arrangement pertains to Giscard d'Estaing. The date span of these card files ranges from November 1940 to March 1944. Additional segments of the same collection of card files are located in folder VIII - 173 - b - 20/12, Box No. 24a. (1,137 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20/11a: Consists of four original pages of interrogation summaries of a captured Belgian officer and a Frenchwoman regarding British intelligence activities in occupied France, May 1941 and April 1943. (With cover, five pp.)\n\nBox No. 24a\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20/12: This folder continues and completes the collection of photostatic reproductions of card files maintained by BdS/Paris/Amt IV E on French nationals identified and usually apprehended in espionage or resistance activities. These follow the same informational and physical format as described above, and include segments of card files that supplement those already described. The card files are grouped alphabetically by the first letter of the surname (but thereunder unarranged) for French nationals whose surnames begin with the letters \"H\" - \"L\" and \"R\" - \"Z\" (additional cards for \"H\" and \"L\" surnames are located in folder VIII - 173 - b - 20/11 in Box No. 23). The date span of these cards ranges from January 1941 to March 1944. Related card files for other nationalities residing in occupied France follow in Box No. 25. (1,023 pp.)\n\nBox No. 25\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20 - 16/15 (continued in Box No. 26): The contents of this and the following folder supplement those described above as photostatic reproductions of card files prepared or maintained by the BdS/Paris/Amt IV E for individuals of various nationalities residing in occupied France identified and usually apprehended as espionage agents or resistance members, 1940-44. These follow the same informational and physical format as the previous card files and are arranged alphabetically by nationality and thereunder alphabetically by surname of individual. The nationalities include: Algerian, Arab, Armenian, Australian (for one escaped British Commonwealth POW), Belgian (the largest group), and Czech. The date span of the cards ranges from October 1940 to April 1944. This collection is continued in the next box; similar card files for other nationalities in occupied France are located in the next folder. (372 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20 - 16/20: The contents of this folder continues the collection of photostatic reproductions of card files for individuals of various nationalities residing in occupied France identified and usually apprehended as enemy agents or members of the resistance, 1940-44, begun in the preceding folder. Apparently prepared or maintained by the BdS/Paris/Amt IV E, the card files follow the same informational and physical format as above, and are arranged alphabetically by nationality and thereunder alphabetically by surname of individual. The nationalities include: Holland, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Switzerland, Spain, Turkey and Yugoslavia. With the exception of the entries for Russia, however, these appear to duplicate the more complete collections for these nationalities located in folder 173 - b - 20 - 16/15, Box No. 26, below. The date span of the cards ranges from October 1940 to February 1944. (193 pp.)\n\nBox No. 26\n\nFolder 173 - b - 20 - 16/15 (continued): Continues the collection of photostatic reproductions of card files for identified and usually apprehended enemy agents and resistance members (other than French nationality) in occupied France, apparently prepared or maintained by BdS/Paris/Amt IV E, 1940-44. The card files follow the same informational and physical format as already described, and are arranged by nationality and partially thereunder alphabetically by individual surname. The nationalities include: Denmark, England (only one entry, for a downed RAF pilot), Germany (the largest group, and including data on political emigr\u00e9s, military deserters, and members of the French Foreign Legion), Greece, Haiti, Holland, Hungary, Iraq, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Morocco, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, Tunisia, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. These appear to duplicate and constitute more complete collections for the same nationalities located in folder VIII - 173 - b - 20 - 16/20 in Box No. 25, described above. The date span of these card files ranges from August 1940 to February 1944. Many of the card files here include additional duplicate copies, which have been identified and will be omitted in filming. (Total volume including nationality cover sheets but omitting duplicates = 754 pp.)\n\nBox No. 27\n\nThis box contains two folders, 173 - b - 20 - 18/1 and 2, representing a single collection of negative photostatic reproductions of personnel dossiers for informants and agents employed by the German Abwehr's Abwehrnebenstelle Bremen with surnames beginning with the letters A through K, 1934-45. These dossiers, together with those for informants and agents whose surnames begin with the letters L through Z, are already reproduced on microfilm as part of National Archives Microfilm Publication T77, Records of the German Armed Forces High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, OKW), rolls 1524-25 (no frame numbers available), and described in Guides to German Records Microfilmed at Alexandria, Va., No. 80 (Washington, DC, 1982), pp. 72-73. Arranged alphabetically by surname, the dossiers typically include a biographical questionnaire for each agent (usually including assessments of their character and reliability), associated cover letters and correspondence that often indicate the agent\u0092s code designation, and lists of disposed (burned) related documents. The date span of the dossiers ranges from December 1934 to February 1945. As both these photostatic reproductions and the microfilmed portion of T77 roll 1524 derive from a U.S. Navy/Office of Naval Intelligence microfilm original (ML 202), there is no information provided as to the disposition of the original dossiers. (512 pp. but do not microfilm)\n\nBox No. 28\n\nFolder 173 - b - 16 - 12/80: Consists of a file of original records maintained by the Sicherheitspolizei/Einsatzkommando I/II Metz regarding individuals in occupied Lorraine known or suspected of acts of treason, espionage, or resistance, 1941-44. Arranged chronologically (with case numbers handwritten in the upper right-hand corner), the folder includes reports, name lists, telegrams, and correspondence regarding identified individuals (including foreign press correspondents) and specific acts of espionage committed by unknown persons in Lorraine ('Lothringen') and adjoining areas of the Saar and Palatinate (\u0091Saarpfalz\u0092), including Saarbr\u00fccken and Trier, during the period March 1941 \u0096 July 1944. The reports include instances of individuals posing as Wehrmacht officers and descriptions of automobiles used by suspects. A table of contents for the principal case-number documents is included. Many cover notes constitute only half-pages, where appropriate these have been combined for filming purposes (175 pages/microfilm images)\n\nFolder 173 \u0096 b \u0096 24 \u0096 05/03: Consists of an original dossier maintained by the RSHA Amt IV E 2 (designated Az. IV 2 b.1877/44 g.) on a captured Norwegian agent working for British intelligence, September 1944 \u0096 March 1945. Included are summary reports and interrogation statements that detail his training, equipment, previous activities, contacts in the Norwegian resistance, and radio ciphers. Some referenced enclosures are not included. Also included in the file, likely by error, is a report on the sabotage of a communications cable in occupied France, June 1943, and internal correspondence authorizing special gas rations for an RSHA staff member in Duisburg, June-July 1941. (67 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 \u0096 b \u0096 24 \u0096 10/9: Consists of an original file maintained by the RSHA Amt IV D 2 containing reports on the organization and functions of British intelligence, basically for the period May - July 1944 (unarranged). Included are identified organizations, their locations and functions, and names of individuals associated with them; types of records include reports by specific agents, translations of British press articles, and summary reports. Of particular note is a translation of a report by the Spanish Falange on the organization and activities of British intelligence in Spain and Spanish Morocco. (90 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 - b - 24 \u0096 26/11: Consists of photostatic reproductions of several standard-form information sheets regarding identified Allied agents and meeting places in Belgium, February 1939 - April 1940. The information sheets were initially prepared by the Abwehrstelle in Wehrkreis VI (located in M\u00fcnster in W.), possibly forwarded to the RSHA. Each information provides the name of an individual or specific location, if an individual his last known address, the agent's or location\u0092s function within Allied intelligence, and identifications of the sources and reliability of the information. (12 pp.)\n\nFolder 173 \u0096 b \u0096 24 - 05/33: Consists of original card files for British and Norwegian agents and instructors active in the training or operations of agents in sabotage. Each card measures 5 \u00be\u0094 x 3 \u00bd \u0093 and includes the agent's name and rank or function, the location of pertinent agent- or sabotage- training center or school, sometimes accompanied by a physical description, an identification of the information source, and/or an internal RSHA filing designation. Probably initially arranged alphabetically by surname of agent but now unarranged, except that an effort has been made to group all the \"A\" surnames together at the beginning of the collection. Dates recorded on the cards range from September 1941 to December 1944. (314 cards)\n\nFolder 173 - e - 10 - 12/120: Consists of several small files, all original records, maintained for the most part by the Gestapo/Staatspolizeistelle Aachen, 1936-44. The first file comprises telegrams and circulars (mostly from Abwehrstelle Wilhelmshaven) regarding alleged plans of the 'International Workers' Federation' to sabotage German industrial and trade goods, September-December 1939, with biographical data (including photographs) pertaining to the organization's leaders (48 pp.); the second file consists of circulars and correspondence regarding preparations for the visit of Interior Minister Dr. Wilhelm Frick to Aachen, August 1936 - January 1937 (12 pp.); the third file (designated 'Az. IV 2329/44g., Kurier-Liste Marstrander,' but of unknown provenance) comprises a copy of a report of the arrest of Finn Marstrander, a Norwegian bank official involved in the Norwegian resistance, November 1944 (3 pp.). At the end of the folder, possibly included by error, is a collection of loose personal papers and correspondence of individuals unaccompanied by any official documentation. This material includes: three bank receipts for payments made to the SD-F\u00fchrer Strassburg, July-September 1944; a large number of handwritten letters to Frau Ruth L\u00f6ffler geb. Schlemmer, April 1934-March 1936; several unidentified photographs of individuals; an annotated personal calendar for 1942 for an unidentified individual; a personal record of savings deposits in the Sparkasse der Stadt Berlin, April 1940-March 1945; and miscellaneous forms and receipts. Except for the bank receipts, these loose materials have not been microfilmed. (70 pp. microfilmed, loose materials omitted)\n\nBox Nos. 29 and 30\n\nThese boxes contain thirteen packets of original card files, designated 173 \u0096 b \u0096 24 \u0096 05/38 through \u0096 05/50, that constitute a single collection of reference cards for more than 1,800 German and foreign intelligence agents and informants employed by Abwehrstelle Wien and Abwehrnebenstelle Graz, 1938-44. Each card measures 5 \u00be\u0094 x 4\u0094 and includes entries for the agent\u0092s name, code name or designation, date and place of birth, occupation, place of residence, nationality, language skills, an identification of the Abwehr office and date whence the agent was first employed, a record of previous military service if applicable, the country or region (e.g., \"Balkan\") where the agent is most suited for employment, the subject area of the agent's expertise (expressed by an internal-use abbreviation, e.g. \"I Luft,\" \"VI wi\"), and place(s) and date(s) of previous employment by German intelligence. The reverse side of each card often includes annotations to specific Abwehr report or file numbers and additional information; for some agents more than one card was required. Information on the cards is usually typed but sometimes handwritten. The card files are arranged alphabetically by surname of agent or informant, with each packet constituting one alphabetical segment as follows (surnames beginning with the letter \u0093S\u0094 follow the German tradition of subdivisions into Sa-Sz, Scha-Schz, and Sta-Stz):\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/38: Abrus through Bozina (Box No. 29)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/39: Brackx through Dzundza (Box No. 29)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/40: Ebner through Grau (Box No. 29)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/41: Gregor through H\u00f6glinger (Box No. 29)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/42: Hohenlohe through Konrad (Box No. 29)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/43: Konstantinidis through Kuhnert (Box No. 29)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/44: K\u00fchnle through Midin (Box No. 30)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/45: Migdaal through Podhajecky (Box No. 30)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/46: Pogner through Ruttner (Box No. 30)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/47: Saad el Din through Scheuchenbauer (Box No. 30)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/48: Schewtschenko through Sturm (Box No. 30)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/49: Tabakoff through Vukovic (Box No. 30)\n\n173 - b - 24 - 05/50: Wabnig through Zwiegincew (Box No. 30)\n\nFollowing the last segment there is an additional small set of card files, also alphabetically-arranged by surname, for agents and informants separately registered for Abwehrnebenstelle Graz. These follow the same format as the main series.\n\nThe spellings of names of non-German agents and informants follow German transliterations of the original, e.g. \"Tschapenko, Iwan,\" \"Woronzow, Wladimir.\" Many of the cards are annotated or stamped, the meanings of which are unclear; a handwritten cross apparently indicates that the agent was deceased. The dates entered on the cards suggest that the card files were prepared during the period August 1938 - December 1944, but information for previous intelligence service includes dates as early as 1932. Packets 173 - b - 24 - 05/38 through /43 number approximately 875 cards; those in packets 173 - b - 24 - 05/44 through -05/50 number ca. 1,050 cards. An accessioned 16mm microfilm copy of these card files is located in Stack 290: 0C/36/05, Box 1. (Total number of microfilm images, including ca. 75% of reverse sides of cards = ca. 3,370)\n\nBox No. 30a\n\nThis box contains only one folder, 173 - e - 10 - 12/91, which represents a collection of original telegrams and communications received initially by the Polizeifunkstelle Erfurt, later the Gestapo/Staatspolizeileitstelle Erfurt, that pertain to individuals and national security issues, mostly for the period 1934-38. Most of the telegrams identify individuals wanted or arrested for espionage, illegal political activity or traveling with false identification papers, or who were otherwise wanted for questioning or recommended for police surveillance. Arranged in reverse chronological order, the telegrams are divided unequally among the following time-periods: 8 January - 7 June 1934 (the majority of the folder, composed entirely of half-sheets); 17 December 1934 - 2 May 1935 (a few half-sheets); and 19 November 1935 - 16 May 1938 (scattered full-sized sheets). At the very beginning of the folder, likely filed here in error, is a telegram and cover notes sent to the Kommandeur der Sipo und des SD Metz regarding a Waffen-SS officer wanted for desertion, October 1944. There is some duplication among the telegrams (to be omitted in filming). Half-sheet telegrams should be filmed two per microfilm image. (Total microfilm images = 121).\n\nBox No. 31\n\nNote: In addition to the RSHA \"Himmler files\" described above, another original German record item was also declassified by determination of the Interagency Working Group in 2000, identified as record item OKW/134 (original German Signatur 70/M 33284), Abwehr IIID, \"Fragebogen und ausl\u00e4ndische Berichte,\" March 1942-March 1943. This file, originated by Section IIID of Amt Ausland-Abwehr of the German Armed Forces High Command, concerns counterintelligence activities of the Abwehr, Gestapo, and other German police and security organizations against Allied and Soviet espionage and sabotage networks and resistance organizations. Included is information on Allied agents arrested in Germany, lists of names of identified agents operating in the Balkans and the Near East, and summaries of counterintelligence activities throughout occupied Europe. Partially declassified in 1981 (NND 816029), the contents were not completely declassified until 2000 because of the inclusion of names of American and British intelligence personnel and descriptions of Allied intelligence organizations and facilities. This item will be added to the RSHA files for microfilming; as many original pages are fragile or damaged, photocopies have been made for use in microfilming (total microfilm images = ca. 310)."}, {"url": "https://www.geni.com/projects/German-Resistance-Movement-between-1933-1945/25384", "page_content": "The German Resistance movement consisted of several disparate political and ideological strands, which represented different classes of German society. A few civilian resistance groups developed, but the Army was the only organization with the capacity to overthrow the government, and from within it a small number of officers came to present the most serious threat posed to the Nazi regime, the July 20th Plot. . . . continued\n\nWiderstandsk\u00e4mpfer (\"Resistance fighters\")\n\nIndividuals involved in the German Resistance against Nazism risked or lost their lives in a number of ways. They tried to overthrow the National Socialist regime, they denounced its war criminals, tried to prevent World War II and sabotaged German attacks on other countries. Some tried to protect those who were being harmed and persecuted by the Nazis, others merely refused to contribute to the Nazi war effort.\n\nResistance Movements\n\n\n\nWei\u00dfe Rose / White Rose\n\nWhite Rose die Wei\u00dfe Rose was a non-violent, intellectual resistance group in Nazi Germany, consisting of students from the University of Munich and their philosophy professor. Today, the members of the White Rose are honoured in Germany amongst its greatest heroes, since they opposed the Third Reich in the face of almost certain death. . . . . . . continued.\n\nSophie (age 21) and Hans Scholl (24) and their friend Christoph Probst (24), members of the under\u00adground White Rose (Wei\u00dfe Rose) resis\u00adtance circle, were charged with sedition for writing, printing, and distri\u00adbuting anti-Nazi leaflets and \u201ctried\u201d by \u201cHitler\u2019s Hanging Judge,\u201d the noto\u00adrious Nazi jurist Roland Freisler. (A year earlier Freisler had attended the Wann\u00adsee Confer\u00adence on the \u201cfinal solution\u201d to the Jewish problem.)\n\nOriginally, the Scholls had been enthu\u00adsiastic supporters of the German renewal promised by National Socialism and enrolled in the Hitler Youth organi\u00adzation. But as their reali\u00adza\u00adtion of Nazi atro\u00adcities directed against Jews on the Eastern Front grew, so did their moral outrage. Betrayed by a custo\u00addian in the act of distri\u00adbuting their flyers, the Scholls were found guilty in Freisler\u2019s court and beheaded on same day at Munich\u2019s Stadel\u00adheim Prison.\n\nAfter their deaths, their sixth and last leaflet was smuggled to the Allies, who retitled it \u201cThe Manifesto of the Students of Munich\u201d and air-dropped millions of copies over Germany.\n\nMembers of the White Rose, especially the Scholls, became heroes in post\u00adwar Germany. One of Germany\u2019s leading literary prizes is called the Geschwister Scholl prize (the \u201cScholl Siblings\u201d prize). Many local streets and squares in Germany have been named after the brother and sister. Geschwister-Scholl-Schule is the most common school name in Germany.\n\nIn 2003 Germans were invited by a tele\u00advision broad\u00adcaster to choose the top ten most important Germans of all time. Voters under the age of 40 helped Hans and Sophie Scholl finish in fourth place, above Bach, Goethe, Guten\u00adberg, Bismarck, and Einstein. If the votes of young viewers alone had been counted, the Scholls would have been ranked first. Several years earlier, readers of a German women\u2019s magazine voted Sophie Scholl \u201cthe greatest woman of the twentieth century.\u201d Source\n\n\n\nThe Rosenstra\u00dfe Protest\n\nThe Women's Rosenstra\u00dfe Protest Many people believe that it was impossible for the Germans to resist the Nazi dictatorship and the deportations of German Jews. However, a street protest in early 1943 indicates that resistance was possible, and indeed, successful. A nonviolent protest in Rosenstra\u00dfe (\"Rose street\") in Berlin in February and March 1943, carried out by the non-Jewish (\"Aryan\") wives and relatives of Jewish men who had been arrested for deportation. The protests escalated until the men were released. It was a significant instance of opposition to the events of the Holocaust. . . . continued\n\nRosenstrasse Movie\n\n\n\nDie Rote Kapelle / Red Orchestra\n\nRed Orchestra Die Rote Kapelle was the name given by the Gestapo to an anti-Nazi resistance movement in Berlin, as well as to Soviet espionage rings operating in German-occupied Europe and Switzerland during World War II. . . . continued.\n\n\n\nThe Red Orchestra Movie\n\nEdelwei\u00dfpiraten / Edelweiss Pirates\n\nEdelwei\u00dfpiraten were a loosely-organized group of youth in Nazi Germany and consisted of young people, mainly between the ages of 14 and 17, who had evaded the Hitler Youth. The Nazi response was harsh. . . . continued\n\n\n\nEurop\u00e4ische Union\n\nThe original European Union (German: Europ\u00e4ische Union) was an antifascist resistance group during Germany's Nazi era. The Berlin-based resistance group was founded in 1939. . . . continued\n\n\n\nB\u00e4stlein Jacob Abshagen Group\n\nThe B\u00e4stlein-Jacob-Abshagen Group was a German resistance group that developed around the core members Bernhard B\u00e4stlein, Franz Jacob and Robert Abshagen. It fought the National Socialist (Nazi) regime from 1940 till the end of the war in 1945. It consisted of about 300 members in over 30 groups in Hamburg factories, making it the biggest regional Nazi resistance group in the history of Hamburg. . . . continued.\n\n\n\nSaefkow Jacob B\u00e4stlein Organization\n\nThe Saefkow-Jacob-B\u00e4stlein Organization It was one of the largest groups in the German resistance against the National Socialist state. Its hub was in Berlin. Many of its members were arrested by the Gestapo in 1944 and later killed. They published the illegal magazine, Die Innere Front (\"The Internal Front\"). . . . continued\n\n\n\nKreisau Circle\n\nKreisau Circle was the name the Nazi Gestapo gave to a group of German dissidents centered on the estate of Helmuth James Graf von Moltke at Kreisau, Silesia (now Krzy\u017cowa, Poland). It is regarded as one of the main centers of German opposition to the Nazi regime. The difficulty for all such dissidents was how to reconcile patriotic loyalty to Germany with opposition to the Nazis, once the Nazis had subverted the state to such an extent that the two were almost inextricable. . . . continued\n\n\n\nSolf-Kreis / Solf Circle\n\nSolf Circle Solf-Kreis was an informal gathering of German intellectuals involved in the resistance against Nazi Germany. Most members were arrested and executed after attending a tea party in Berlin September 10, 1943 at the residence of Elisabeth von Thadden. The group's downfall also ultimately led to the demise of the Abwehr in February 1944. . . . continued\n\n\n\nRobert Uhrig Group\n\nRobert Uhrig was a German communist and resistance fighter against National Socialism. He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1934 and sentenced to hard labor at the Zuchthaus in Luckau. After his release in summer 1936, he went underground, working in the leadership of the Berlin KPD. Starting in 1938, he led a network of resistance groups in over 20 factories in Berlin, which became part of one of the largest anti-fascist resistance organizations in Berlin. . . . continued\n\n\n\nEherenfeld Group\n\nEhrenfeld Group, aka the Steinbr\u00fcck Group was an anti-Nazi resistance group, active in the summer and autumn of 1944. . . . continued\n\n\n\nHerbert Baum Group\n\nHerbert Baum was a Jewish member of the German resistance against National Socialism together with his wife Marianne Baum (Kohn). On 18 May 1942, the group organised an arson attack on an anticommunist and anti-Semitic propaganda exhibition prepared by Joseph Goebbels at the Berliner Lustgarten.\n\nMany of Baum Group's members were all executed in Berlin-Pl\u00f6tzensee on March 4, 1943.: Heinz Rotholz (1922\u20131943), Heinz Birnbaum (1920\u20131943), Hella Hirsch (1921\u20131943), Alice Hirsch (1923 - 1942), Hanni Meyer (1921\u20131943), Marianne Joachim (1922\u20131943), Lothar Salinger (1920\u20131943), Helmut Neumann (1922\u20131943), Hildegard L\u00f6wy and Siegbert Rotholz (1922\u20131943). . . . continued\n\n\n\nVierergruppe\n\nVierergruppen in Hamburg, Munich and Vienna] was a small German resistance group that fought the National Socialists. There were three \"groups of four\" working simultaneously and independently of each other in Hamburg, Munich and Vienna. They used leaflets and wall slogans to agitate against the war, against the regime of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. . . . continued\n\n\n\nBekennende Kirche / Confessing Church\n\nConfessing Church, Bekennende Kirche was a Protestant church in Nazi Germany that arose in opposition to government-sponsored efforts to nazify the German Protestant church. A limited number of Protestants, such as Karl Barth, Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Wilhelm Busch, objected to the Nazis on moral and theological principles: they could not reconcile the Nazi state's claim to total control over the person with the ultimate sovereignty that, in Christian orthodoxy, must belong only to God.\n\nUnder the leadership of Martin Niem\u00f6ller, the Pastors' Emergency League (Pfarrernotbund) was formed, presumably for the purpose of assisting clergy of Jewish descent, but the League soon evolved into a locus of dissent against Nazi interference in church affairs. . . . continued\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe July 20th Plot / Operation Valkyrie\n\nThe \"July Plot\" to Assassinate Hitler (July 20, 1944) was a coup d'\u00e9tat which involved a failed attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. At least 7,000 people were arrested by the Gestapo. According to records of the Fuehrer Conferences on Naval Affairs, 4,980 people were executed.\n\nThe most prominent conspirators were ordered to be \"hanged like cattle\" by Hitler. At the Pl\u00f6tzensee prison, those people were hung on symbolic meathooks with rope. Among those executed were two field marshals, 19 generals, 26 colonels, two ambassadors, seven diplomats, one minister, three secretaries of state, as well as the head of the Reich Police.\n\nAt the end of 1943 the Schutz Staffeinel (SS) and the Gestapo managed to arrest several Germans involved in plotting to overthrow Adolf Hitler. This included Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Klaus Bonhoeffer, Josef Mueller and Hans Dohnanyi. Others under suspicion like Wilhelm Canaris and Hans Oster were dismissed from office in January, 1944.\n\nMajor Claus von Stauffenberg now emerged as the leader of the group opposed to Nazi rule. In 1942, he decided to kill Adolf Hitler. He was joined by Wilhelm Canaris,Carl Goerdeler, Julius Leber, Ulrich Hassell, Hans Oster, Peter von Wartenburg, Henning von Tresckow, Friedrich Olbricht, Werner von Haeften, Fabian Schlabrendorft, Ludwig Beck and Erwin von Witzleben.\n\nThe plot was developed as a modification of Operation Valkyrie (Unternehmen Walk\u00fcre), which was approved by Hitler for use if Allied bombing of German cities or an uprising of forced laborers from occupied countries working in German factories resulted in a breakdown in law and order.\n\nMembers of the Reserve Army, including members of the Kreisau Circle, modified the plan and decided to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Hermann Goering and Heinrich Himmler. Afterward, they planned for troops in Berlin to seize key government buildings, telephone and signal centers and radio stations. Hitler's death was required to free German soldiers from their oath of loyalty to him. Operation Valkyrie was meant to give the plotters control over the government so they could make peace with the Allies and end the war.\n\nAt least six attempts were aborted before Claus von Stauffenberg decided on trying again during a conference attended by Hitler on July 20, 1944. It was decided to drop plans to kill Goering and Himmler at the same time. Stauffenberg, who had never met Hitler before, carried the bomb in a briefcase and placed it on the floor while he left to make a phone-call. The bomb exploded killing four men in the hut. Hitler's right arm was badly injured but he survived the bomb blast.\n\nThe plan was for Ludwig Beck, Erwin von Witzleben and Friedrich Fromm to take control of the German Army. The coup failed in part because they delayed implementing the plan until official confirmation of Hitler's death could be received. When they learned that Hitler had survived, Valkyrie was not put in effect.\n\nOver the next few months most of the group, including Wilhelm Canaris, Carl Goerdeler, Julius Leber, Ulrich Hassell, Hans Oster, Peter von Wartenburg, Henning von Tresckow, Ludwig Beck, Erwin von Witzleben and Friedrich Fromm, were either executed or committed suicide. Ninety of the supposed conspirators were executied between August 1944 and April 1945 at the Plotzensee Prison.\n\nIn March 2013, the last surviving member of the plot - Ewald-Heinrich von Kleist-Schmenzin - died in Munich.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\nThis list contains the names of individuals involved in the German Resistance against Nazism, but is not a complete list. Most of those on the list worked with others; their affiliated resistance group or groups are listed. Where no group is mentioned, the individual acted alone.

Nana is herself an artist, and we spent three hours in her studio in Schwabing, about half a mile from Cornelius\u2019s apartment, looking at reproductions of her grandfather\u2019s work and tracing his remarkable career\u2014how he had transcendently documented the horrors he had lived through on the front lines of both wars, at one point being forbidden by the Gestapo to paint or even buy art materials. Dix, who came from humble origins (his father worked in an iron foundry in Gera), was one of the great under-recognized artists of the 20th century. Only Picasso expressed himself as masterfully in so many styles: Expressionism, Cubism, Dadaism, Impressionism, abstract, grotesque hyper-realism. Dix\u2019s powerful, searingly honest images reflect\u2014as Hildebrand Gurlitt described the unsettling modern art he collected\u2014\u201cthe struggle to come to terms with who we are.\u201d According to Nana Dix, 200 of his major works are still missing.\n\nThe Ghost\n\nWithin hours of the Focus piece\u2019s publication, the sensational story of Cornelius Gurlitt and his billion-dollar secret hoard of art had been picked up by major media all over the world. Every time he stepped out of his building, microphones were thrust in his face and cameras started to roll. After being mobbed by paparazzi, he spent 10 days in his empty apartment without leaving it. According to Der Spiegel, the last movie he saw was in 1967. He hadn\u2019t watched television since 1963. He did read the paper and listened to the radio, so he had some idea of what was going on in the world, but his actual experience of it was very limited and he was out of touch with a lot of developments. He rarely traveled\u2014he had gone to Paris, once, with his sister years ago. He said he had never been in love with an actual person. The pictures were his whole life. And now they were gone. The grief he had been going through for the last year and a half, alone in his empty apartment, the bereavement, was unimaginable. The loss of his pictures, he told \u00d6zlem Gezer, Der Spiegel\u2019s reporter\u2014it was the only interview he would grant\u2014hit him harder than the loss of his parents, or his sister, who died of cancer in 2012. He blamed his mother for bringing them to Munich, the seat of evil, where it all began, with Hitler\u2019s abortive Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. He insisted his father had only associated with Nazis in order to save these precious works of art, and Cornelius felt it was his duty to protect them, just as his father had heroically done. Gradually the artworks became his entire world, a parallel universe full of horror, passion, beauty, and endless fascination, in which he was a spectator. He was like a character in a Russian novel\u2014intense, obsessed, isolated, and increasingly out of touch with reality.\n\nThere are a lot of solitary old men in Munich, living in the private world of their memories, dark, horrible memories for those old enough to have lived through the war and the Nazi period. I thought I recognized Cornelius several times, waiting for the bus or nursing a weiss beer alone in a Brauhaus late in the morning, but they were other pale, frail, old white-haired men who looked just like him. Nobody had given Cornelius a second glance, but now he was a celebrity.\n\nStorming the Castle\n\nAfter Allied bombers obliterated the center of Dresden, in February 1945, it was clear that the Third Reich was finished. Hildebrand had a Nazi colleague, Baron Gerhard von P\u00f6lnitz, who had helped him and another art dealer, Karl Haberstock, put deals together when von P\u00f6lnitz was in the Luftwaffe and stationed in Paris. Von P\u00f6lnitz invited the two of them to bring their personal collections and take refuge in his picturesque castle in Aschbach, in northern Bavaria.\n\nOn April 14, 1945, with Hitler\u2019s suicide and Germany\u2019s surrender only weeks away, Allied troops entered Aschbach. They found Haberstock and his collection and Gurlitt, with 47 crates of \u201cart objects,\u201d in the castle. The \u201cMonuments Men\u201d\u2014approximately 345 men and women with fine-arts expertise who were charged with protecting Europe\u2019s monuments and cultural treasures, and the subject of the George Clooney film\u2014were brought in. Two men, a captain and a private, were assigned to investigate the works in Aschbach Castle. Haberstock was described on the O.S.S.\u2019s red-flag name list as \u201cthe leading Nazi art dealer,\u201d \u201cthe most prolific German buyer in Paris,\u201d and \u201cregarded in all quarters as the most important German art figure.\u201d He had been involved in the campaign against Degenerate Art from 1933 to 1939 and in 1936 had become Hitler\u2019s personal dealer. Hildebrand Gurlitt was described as \u201can art dealer from Hamburg with connections within high-level Nazi circles\u201d who was \u201cone of the official agents for Linz\u201d but who, being partly Jewish, had problems with the party and used Theo Hermssen\u2014a well-known figure in the Nazi art world\u2014as a front until Hermssen died in 1944.\n\nHaberstock was taken into custody and his collection was impounded, and Hildebrand was placed under house arrest in the castle, which was not lifted until 1948. His works were taken away for processing. Hildebrand explained that they were legitimately his. Most of them came from his father, an avid collector of modern art, he said. He listed how each of them had come into his possession, and, according to Der Spiegel, falsified the provenance of the ones that were stolen or acquired under duress. For instance, there was a painting by the Bulgarian artist Jules Pascin. Hildebrand claimed that he had inherited it from his father, but he had actually bought it for far less than it was worth in 1935 from Julius Ferdinand Wollf, the Jewish editor of one of Dresden\u2019s major newspapers. (Wollf had been removed from his post in 1933 and would commit suicide with his wife and brother in 1942 as they were about to be shipped to concentration camps.) The detailed documentation for the works, Hildebrand claimed, had been in his house in Dresden, which had been reduced to rubble during the Allied bombing. Fortunately, he and his wife, Helene, had been offered refuge in Aschbach Castle by Baron von P\u00f6lnitz and had managed to get out of Dresden with these works just before the bombing. He claimed that the rest of his collection had to be left behind and was also destroyed.\n\nHildebrand persuaded the Monuments Men that he was a victim of the Nazis. They had fired him from two museums. They called him a \u201cmongrel\u201d because of his Jewish grandmother. He was doing what he could to save these wonderful and important maligned pictures, which would otherwise have been burned by the SS. He assured them he never bought a painting that wasn\u2019t offered voluntarily.\n\nLater in 1945, Baron von P\u00f6lnitz was arrested and the Gurlitts were joined by more than 140 emaciated, traumatized survivors of the concentration camps, most of them under 20. Aschbach Castle had been made into a displaced-persons camp.\n\nThe Monuments Men eventually returned 165 of Hildebrand\u2019s pieces but kept the rest, which clearly had been stolen, and their investigation of his wartime activities and his art collection was closed. What they didn\u2019t know was that Hildebrand had lied about his collection having been destroyed in Dresden\u2014much of it had actually been hidden in a Franconia water mill and in another secret location, in Saxony.\n\nAfter the war, with his collection largely intact, Hildebrand moved to D\u00fcsseldorf, where he continued to deal in artworks. His reputation sufficiently rehabilitated, he was elected the director of the Kunstverein, the city\u2019s venerable art institution. What he had had to do in the war was becoming more and more a fading memory. In 1956, Hildebrand was killed in a car crash.\n\nIn 1960, Helene sold four paintings from her late husband\u2019s collection, one of them a portrait of Bertolt Brecht by Rudolf Schlichter, and bought two apartments in an expensive new building in Munich.\n\nNot much is known about Cornelius\u2019s upbringing. When the Allies came to the castle, Cornelius was 12, and he and his sister, Benita, were soon sent off to boarding school. Cornelius was an extremely sensitive, desperately shy boy. He studied art history at the University of Cologne and took courses in music theory and philosophy, but for unknown reasons he broke off his studies. He seemed content to be alone, a reclusive artist in Salzburg, his sister reported to a friend in 1962. Six years later, their mother died. Since then, Cornelius has divided his time between Salzburg and Munich and appears to have been spending increasing amounts of time in the Schwabing apartment with his pictures. For the last 45 years, he seems to have had almost no contact with anybody, apart from his sister, until her death, two years ago, and his doctor, reportedly in W\u00fcrzburg, a small city three hours from Munich by train, whom he went to see every three months.\n\nRaubkunst and Restitution\n\nAfter the artworks were seized, Meike Hoffmann, an art historian with the \u201cDegenerate Art\u201d Research Center at Berlin\u2019s Free University, was brought in to trace their provenance. Hoffmann worked on them for a year and a half and identified 380 that were Degenerate artworks, but she was clearly overwhelmed. An international task force, under the Berlin-based Bureau of Provenance Research and led by the retired deputy to Germany\u2019s commissioner for culture and media, Ingeborg Berggreen-Merkel, was appointed to take over the task. Berggreen-Merkel said that \u201ctransparency and progress are the urgent priorities,\u201d and that the confirmed Raubkunst was being put up on the government\u2019s Lost Art Database Web site as quickly as possible. One of the paintings on the site, the most valuable found in Cornelius\u2019s apartment\u2014with an estimated value of $6 million to $8 million (although some experts estimate it could go for as much as $20 million at auction)\u2014is the Matisse stolen from Paul Rosenberg. The Rosenberg heirs have its bill of sale from 1923 and have filed a claim for it with the chief prosecutor. One of the heirs is Rosenberg\u2019s granddaughter Anne Sinclair, the ex-wife of Dominique Strauss-Kahn and a well-known French political commentator who runs Le Huffington Post. In December, the German television show Kulturzeit reported that as many as 30 claims have been made on the same Matisse, which illustrates the problem Ronald Lauder described to me: \u201cWhen you put them up on the Internet, everybody says, \u2018Hey, I remember my uncle had a picture like this.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBerggreen-Merkel also said the task force, which answers to the chief prosecutor, Nemetz, does not have the mandate to get the artworks back to their original owners or their heirs. There is nothing in German law compelling Cornelius to give them back. Nemetz estimated that 310 of the works were \u201cdoubtless the property of the accused\u201d and could be returned to him immediately. The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, responded that the prosecutor should rethink his plans to return any of the works.\n\nIn November, Bavaria\u2019s newly appointed justice minister, Winfried Bausback, said, \u201cEveryone involved on the federal and state level should have tackled this challenge with more urgency and resources from the start.\u201d In February, a revision of the statute-of-limitations law, drawn up by Bausback, was presented to the upper house of Parliament. Stuart Eizenstat, Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s special adviser on Holocaust issues, who drafted the 1998 Washington Principles\u2019 international norms for art restitution, had been pressuring Germany to lift the 30-year statute of limitations. After all, how could anybody have filed claims for Cornelius\u2019s pictures if their existence was unknown?\n\nTo Protect and Serve\n\nHildebrand Gurlitt, spinning his heroic narrative in an unpublished six-page essay he wrote in 1955, a year before his death, said, \u201cThese works have meant for me \u2026 the best of my life.\u201d He recalled his mother taking him to the Bridge school\u2019s first show, at the turn of the century, a seminal event for Expressionism and modern art, and how \u201cthese barbaric, passionately powerful colors, this rawness, enclosed in the poorest of wooden frames\u201d were \u201clike a slap in the face\u201d to the middle class. He wrote that he had come to regard the works that had ended up in his possession \u201cnot as my property, but rather as a kind of fief that I have been assigned to steward.\u201d Cornelius felt that he had also inherited the duty to protect them, just as his father had from the Nazis, the bombs, and the Americans.\n\nTen days after the Focus story, Cornelius managed to escape the paparazzi in Munich and took the train for his tri-monthly checkup with his doctor. It was a little expedition, and a welcome change of scenery from his hermetic existence in the apartment, that he always looked forward to, Der Spiegel reported. He left Munich two days before the appointment and returned the day after and had made the hotel reservation months ahead of time, posting the typed request, signed with a fountain pen. Cornelius has a chronic heart condition, which his doctor says has been acting up now more than usual, because of all the excitement.\n\nIn late December, just before his 81st birthday, Cornelius was admitted to a clinic in Munich, where he remains. A legal guardian was appointed by the district court of Munich, an intermediate type of guardian who does not have the power to make decisions but is brought in when someone is overwhelmed with understanding and exercising his rights, especially in complex legal matters. Cornelius has hired three lawyers, and a crisis-management public-relations firm to deal with the media. On January 29, two of the lawyers filed a John Doe complaint with the public prosecutor\u2019s office in Munich, against whoever leaked information from the investigation to Focus and thus violated judicial secrecy.\n\nThen, on February 10, Austrian authorities found approximately 60 more pieces, including paintings by Monet, Renoir, and Picasso, in Cornelius\u2019s Salzburg house. According to his new spokesman, Stephan Holzinger, Cornelius asked that they be investigated to determine if any had been stolen, and an initial evaluation suggested that none had. A week later, Holzinger announced the creation of a Web site, gurlitt.info, which included this statement from Cornelius: \u201cSome of what has been reported about my collection and myself is not correct or not quite correct. Consequently my lawyers, my legal caretaker, and I want to make available information to objectify the discussion about my collection and my person.\u201d Holzinger added that the creation of the site was their attempt to \u201cmake clear that we are willing to engage in dialogue with the public and any potential claimants,\u201d as Cornelius did with the Flechtheim heirs when he sold The Lion Tamer.\n\nOn February 19, Cornelius\u2019s lawyers filed an appeal against the search warrant and seizure order, demanding the reversal of the decision that led to the confiscation of his artworks, because they are not relevant to the charge of tax evasion.\n\nCornelius\u2019s cousin, Ekkeheart Gurlitt, a photographer in Barcelona, said that Cornelius was \u201ca lone cowboy, a lonely soul, and a tragic figure. He wasn\u2019t in it for the money. If he were, he would have sold the pictures long ago.\u201d He loved them. They were his whole life.\n\nWithout admirers like that, art is nothing.\n\nWorks from the 1937 \u201cDegenerate Art\u201d show, as well as some Nazi-approved art from \u201cThe Great German Art Exhibition,\u201d will be on display at New York\u2019s Neue Galerie through June."}, {"url": "https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/duquesne-spy-ring", "page_content": "In September 1939, a Dr. Gassner visited Sebold and interrogated him regarding military planes and equipment in the United States. He also asked Sebold to return to the U.S. as an espionage agent for Germany.\n\nSubsequent visits by Dr. Gassner and a \u201cDr. Renken\u201d\u2014later identified as Major Nickolaus Ritter of the German Secret Service\u2014persuaded Sebold to cooperate with the Reich because he feared reprisals against family members still living in Germany.\n\nSince Sebold\u2019s passport has been stolen shortly after his first visit from Dr. Gassner, Sebold went to the American Consulate in Cologne, Germany, to obtain a new one. While doing so, Sebold secretly told personnel in the American Consulate about his future role as a German agent and expressed his wish to cooperate with the FBI upon his return to America.\n\nSebold reported to Hamburg, Germany, where he was instructed in such areas as preparing coded messages and microphotographs. After completing his training, he was given five microphotographs containing instructions for preparing a code and detailing the type of information he was to transmit to Germany from the United States. Sebold was told to retain two of the microphotographs and to deliver the other three to German operatives in the United States. After receiving final instructions, including using the assumed name of \u201cHarry Sawyer,\u201d he sailed from Genoa, Italy, and arrived in New York City on February 8, 1940.\n\nThe FBI had been advised of Sebold\u2019s expected arrival, his mission, and his intentions to help identify German agents in the United States. Under the guidance of FBI agents, Sebold established residence in New York City as \u201cHarry Sawyer,\u201d using a cover as a diesel engineer consultant to help him establish contacts with members of the spy ring.\n\nHe was then to meet with various spies, pass along instructions to them from Germany, receive messages in return, and transmit them back in code to Germany.\n\nWith Sebold\u2019s masterful acting, the FBI played right along with the ruse, using some deceits of its own.\n\nFirst, FBI Lab engineers built a secret shortwave radio transmitting station on Long Island. In May 1940, Bureau agents established contact with the German shortwave station abroad. Our Long Island radio station served as a main channel of communication between German spies in New York City and their superiors in Germany for 16 straight months. Pretending to be Sebold, FBI agents sent more than 300 authentic-sounding messages and received another 200 messages from the Nazis."}, {"url": "https://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/a-small-light/", "page_content": "Historical Accuracy (Q&A):\n\nHow is A Small Light different from other movies and TV series about the Holocaust and Anne Frank's family?\n\nInstead of focusing on Anne Frank and her family, A Small Light takes a different approach.

Unlike films such as The Survivor, The Pianist, and numerous others that focus primarily on the victims of the Holocaust, A Small Light is more akin to The Zookeeper's Wife and Schindler's List, which shine a light on the individuals who risked their lives to help the people who were being persecuted.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictured at the top is the Frank family, including (from left to right) daughter Margot, father Otto, daughter Anne, and mother Edith. At the bottom is the family as depicted in the Nat Geo miniseries.\n\nDid Miep Gies work for Otto Frank, Anne's father?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs emphasized in the series, the A Small Light true story confirms that Miep was also an immigrant to Amsterdam herself. Her biological family had sent her from Austria to the Netherlands at age 11 as part of a relief project to help malnourished Austrian children. She ended up living with a foster family, the Nieuwenburgs, in the city of Leiden in South Holland. The family moved to Amsterdam in 1924.\n\n\n\nYes. For six years, Miep Gies had worked as a typist in an embroidery and pleating workshop before losing her job when the crisis hit. Struggling to find work, an upstairs neighbor told her about another opportunity. The female neighbor worked as a representative for a business owned by a man named Otto Frank. At the time, Otto was still setting up his business, named Opekta, and was looking for employees. Otto's business was located along the canal in the center of Amsterdam at Prinsengracht 263 (pictured below). He had recently moved his family from Germany to the Netherlands in hopes of avoiding persecution. The neighbor arranged for Miep to meet with Otto for an interview. Despite having no experience for the position, her determination, character, and background convinced Otto Frank to take her on as an employee.As emphasized in the series, the A Small Light true story confirms that Miep was also an immigrant to Amsterdam herself. Her biological family had sent her from Austria to the Netherlands at age 11 as part of a relief project to help malnourished Austrian children. She ended up living with a foster family, the Nieuwenburgs, in the city of Leiden in South Holland. The family moved to Amsterdam in 1924.\n\nThe front of Otto Frank's business (left) was located along the canal at Prinsengracht 263. The upper floors of the back building (right) are where the secret annex was located. Both photos were taken during the 1950s.\n\nWhat was Otto Frank's business?\n\nThe A Small Light fact-check reveals that according to the United States Holocaust Museum, Otto Frank's company, Opekta, \"manufactured products used for making jellies and jams.\" After becoming proficient in the jam-making process, Miep Gies was promoted to customer service, where she took phone calls and responded to questions by mail (AnneFrank.org).\n\nDid Miep Gies have a gay brother?\n\nA Small Light asserts that Miep Gies had a gay brother, Casmir 'Cass' Niewenburg, who was unrelated to her by blood. In the series, he is the biological son of her foster parents in Amsterdam. When she is unable to find a job, due to both laziness and a lack of employment options, her foster parents suggest that she marry her brother, Cass (Laurie Kynaston). Both Cass and Miep are shocked by the idea and we learn that part of the reason is because Cass is a gay man. If you're familiar with Anne Frank's story but never knew about Miep Gies' gay brother, it's because this aspect of the story is entirely fictional.\n\n\n\nA Small Light writer Tony Phelan commented on this during an interview with RadioTimes, \"And then we took some liberties in the character of Cass, her brother. We know that Miep had five foster brothers \u2013 statistically probably one of them was gay,\" he said. \"But deciding to make Cass gay allowed us into the world of the Caf\u00e9 't Manje and the fact that the queer community in the Netherlands was very active in the Dutch resistance.\"\n\nHad Miep and Jan Gies been recently married?\n\nYes. Like in the A Small Light miniseries, the true story reveals that Miep and Jan had met at her first job and the two became romantically involved. There is some truth to the marriage starting off as a matter of convenience. Due to the fact that Miep had refused to join the Nazi women's association, her passport was invalidated and she had 90 days to return to her birth country of Austria. Marriage was a way for her to become a Dutch citizen and avoid deportation. Miep and Jan were married on July 16, 1941, approximately one year before they helped the Frank family and others hide during the war. Jan Gies had been working as a social worker for the municipality of Amsterdam at the time. They moved into a house not far from Merwedeplein, the location of Anne Frank's family's home. -AnneFrank.org\n\n\n\n\n\nMiep and Jan Gies are pictured on their wedding day on July 16, 1941. On the right are actors Joe Cole and Bel Powley in the Nat Geo miniseries.\n\nWas Miep Gies a short woman?\n\nYes. Gies stood at just 4 feet 11 inches. British actress Bel Powley, who portrays Gies in the series, is approximately 3 inches taller at 5 foot 2.\n\nDid the Frank family decide to go into hiding when Anne's sister Margot was ordered to report to a labor camp?\n\nYes. In researching how accurate is A Small Light, we confirmed that on July 5, 1942, Anne's sister, Margot Frank, received orders from the Gestapo to report for the Arbeitseinsatz (labor deployment). The next day, the family made the decision to go into hiding. -AnneFrank.org\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Frank family made the decision to go into hiding after Margot Frank (left) received orders to report to a labor camp. Ashley Brooke (right) portrays Margot in the National Geographic miniseries.\n\nDid Otto Frank ask Miep Gies to help hide his family?\n\nYes. One day, Otto phoned Miep and informed her of the family's plans to go into hiding, asking her if she'd be willing to help them. The A Small Light fact-check confirms that Miep Gies said yes without hesitation. Otto asked three other employees at the office if they'd be willing to help as well, including Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, and Bep Voskuijl. After Margot Frank received orders from the Gestapo to report to a labor camp, Otto put his plan in motion the following day. Miep Gies' husband, Jan, and Bep Voskuijl's father, Johan, were also instrumental in helping. Partially as a result of his contacts at the municipality, Jan was able to secure ration cards. Johan built the swiveling bookcase that concealed the entrance to the secret annex.\n\n\n\n\"It was a matter of course for me, I was able to help these people,\" Miep said decades later. \"We did our human duty: helping people in need.\" -Anne Frank Magazine, 1998\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Miep Gies bicycle with Margot Frank back to her father's company to hide her?\n\n\n\n\n\nLater in the morning, Margot's father Otto, her mother Edith, and her sister Anne traveled to the building on foot. That day, Miep and her husband Jan brought supplies to the secret annex in the rear of the building where Anne Frank's family went into hiding.\n\n\n\nIn analyzing the A Small Light fact vs. fiction, we learned that Miep did meet Margot Frank at the family's home at Merwedeplein on the morning of July 6, 1942, the day that the Frank family went into hiding. Margot was not wearing the Star of David on her sleeve and she had an illegal bicycle (by then, Jews were not allowed to use bicycles or public transport). Miep and Margot pretended to be two employees on their way to work. Unlike what's seen in the series, they bicycled in a downpour to the building on the Prinsengracht (the canal in the center of Amsterdam) that housed Margot's father's company. In real life, they didn't encounter any police on the way.Later in the morning, Margot's father Otto, her mother Edith, and her sister Anne traveled to the building on foot. That day, Miep and her husband Jan brought supplies to the secret annex in the rear of the building where Anne Frank's family went into hiding.\n\n\n\nDid the Frank family hide in an annex behind Otto Frank's business?\n\nYes. Like in the National Geographic A Small Light miniseries, the secret annex was hidden behind a revolving bookcase in Otto Frank's shop, located at Prinsengracht 263 in Amsterdam. For more than two years, the Frank family lived in the annex. Miep Gies recalled being with the Frank family in the secret annex the day they went into hiding.\n\n\n\n\"The situation was very upsetting. I wanted to leave the family alone together. I couldn't begin to imagine what they must be feeling to have walked away from everything they owned in the world \u2013 their home; a lifetime of gathered possessions; Anne's little cat, Moortje. Keepsakes from the past. And friends. They had simply closed the door of their lives and had vanished from Amsterdam. Mrs. Frank's face said it all. Quickly, I left them.\" -MiepGies.nl\n\nHow many people did Miep Gies help hide in the annex?\n\nThe A Small Light true story reveals that Miep and her devoted husband Jan helped to hide not just the four members of the Frank family in the secret annex, but also their friends, the van Pels (including Hermann, his wife Auguste, and their 15-year-old son Peter van Pels), and Dr. Fritz Pfeffer, a local dentist. The van Pels arrived a week after the Franks went into hiding and Fritz Pfeffer joined them in November 1942. There were a total of eight people in all. The van Pels resided in the upper floor of the secret annex and the Franks shared the lower floor.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr. Fritz Pfeffer (left), a dentist, joined the Frank and van Pels families in hiding in November 1942. Noah Taylor (right) portrays Dr. Pfeffer in the miniseries.\n\nWas Jan Gies part of the Dutch Resistance?\n\nMiep and Jan were two of several people who helped the Franks and the others in the annex. Miep and Bep Voskuijl took on the job of doing the daily grocery shopping. It was Miep's job to bring the meat and vegetables, as well as weekly library books to help pass the time. Bep took care of finding bread and milk. \"Miep is just like a pack mule, she fetches and carries so much,\" Anne Frank wrote in her diary. \"Almost every day she manages to get hold of some vegetables for us brings everything in shopping bags on her bicycle.\"As the war raged on, less and less food was available to the public. Miep became a hunter, tracking down food on a daily basis for her \"ever-hungry nestlings\". \"But slowly, I was turning into an unrelenting scavenger, and would make do even with scraps,\" she later recalled. \"I could not allow myself to get sick. I could not allow myself a holiday.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJan didn't talk much about his day-to-day activities in the Resistance, and even after the war, he didn't go into much detail. The creators of the National Geographic miniseries have attempted to fill in the gaps with fiction, in part to heighten the tension. The only real truth to what's shown in the series is that we know he was recruited at his job, and because he was a social worker, he had access to many of the apartments in Amsterdam. Yes. In Miep Gies' memoir , she talks about Jan's job in the Resistance, stating that he would visit people who had gone into hiding after they refused to go as forced laborers to Germany. He would assess the needs of these \"illegal people\" and then secure various supplies for them, including ration cards and money. Jan had the perfect cover for such work because he was employed as a social worker for the City of Amsterdam.Jan didn't talk much about his day-to-day activities in the Resistance, and even after the war, he didn't go into much detail. The creators of the National Geographic miniseries have attempted to fill in the gaps with fiction, in part to heighten the tension. The only real truth to what's shown in the series is that we know he was recruited at his job, and because he was a social worker, he had access to many of the apartments in Amsterdam.\n\nAre all of Otto Frank's employees in the series based on real people?\n\nNo. Some of the staff are fictional and do not represent real people.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs Miep Gies' friend Tess based on a real person?\n\nNo. Miep Gies' best friend Tess (Eleanor Tomlinson) in the series is not based on a real-life individual. The character was instead inspired by all the people who harbored prejudice and turned a blind eye to what was going on as they attempted to continue living their lives in much the same way as they'd done prior to the German occupation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Miep Gies hide a Dutch student at her house?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Starting in May 1943, Miep and Jan Gies hid a 23-year-old Dutch student named Kuno van der Horst (pictured below) in their home. He went into hiding after refusing to sign a declaration of loyalty to the Nazis. All university students were required to sign the oath of allegiance, which promised that they would not in any way oppose the occupying forces. Those who objected to signing assumed the risk of being apprehended and sent to Germany. Miep and Jan allowed Kuno van der Horst to stay with them until they felt the risk to their lives was too great. It was then that he returned to his mother and made it through the war. -AnneFrank.org\n\nJan and Miep Gies hid Dutch university student Kuno van der Horst (left), who had refused to signed a document declaring his allegiance to the Nazis. Preston Nyman (right) portrays van der Horst in the Nat Geo miniseries. Photos: James Madison University | @preston.nyman Instagram\n\nWhere did the title A Small Light come from?\n\nThe title was taken from a Miep Gies quote from later in her life. \"I don't like being called a hero because no one should ever think you have to be special to help others,\" she said. \"Even an ordinary secretary, housewife, or teenager can turn on a small light in a dark room.\"\n\nDoes the series accurately represent Bep Voskuijl, who also helped Anne Frank's family hide from the Nazis?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot exactly. In answering the question, \"Is A Small Light accurate?\" we discovered that the real Bep Voskuijl (pictured below) helped the Frank family in much the same way that Miep Gies does during the course of the series. However, her contributions are somewhat of a footnote in A Small Light. This was likely done to simplify the series, as some of her efforts seem to have been rolled into Miep's storyline. Still, Bep's contributions deserve to be recognized. She too put her life on the line to do what was right. Miep reflected on Bep at the time of Bep's passing, saying, \"The special thing about Bep was that she was so humble. She was heroic without bravura, simply assumed that the hiders in the annex must be helped. For her, that wasn't a difficult choice to make.\" -Collider\n\nHelpter Bep Voskuijl (left) played a more significant role than what is shown in the miniseries. She is portrayed by actress Sally Messham. Photos: Anne Frank House | National Geographic for Disney\n\nAre the Anne Frank House and annex represented accurately in the series?\n\nYes. Bel Powley told the Jewish Journal that the sets that were built in Prague for the series are \"complete replicas\" of Otto Frank's business and annex at Prinsengracht 263. \"They built it on levels, so ... you could film them walking from the office all the way back into the annex up the stairs. Marc Holmes, our artistic director, is an absolutely incredible man.\" Holmes was meticulous in his efforts to make every detail of the set as authentic as possible to capture how the home and annex looked during the war. He scrutinized every lightbulb, door knob, and window. Today, the front and back buildings are collectively referred to as the Anne Frank House. In the model below, the secret annex is highlighted in blue.\n\n\n\n\n\nDid Miep, Anne, and two others fall sick toward the end of 1943?\n\nYes. While analyzing the A Small Light fact vs. fiction, we learned that next to the fear of being arrested, the hiders and helpers were scared of falling ill. During office hours, the inhabitants of the secret annex had to be extra quiet so as to not alert the stockroom assistants in the office, or anyone else who wasn't aware of their presence. One person's sneezing and coughing could jeopardize everyone in hiding. In November and December 1943, Anne Frank, Miep Gies, Bep Voskuijl, and Johannes Kleiman fell ill. While it caused a good bit of anxiety, fortunately, the sickness wasn't too severe and everyone was feeling better as the year began to wind down. -MiepGies.nl\n\nWere all 8 people in hiding arrested when Dutch police officers raided Prinsengracht 263 and the secret annex?\n\nYes. All eight people in hiding were arrested when Dutch police officers, commanded by SS-Hauptscharf\u00fchrer Karl Josef Silberbauer, unexpectedly raided the offices and the secret annex on the morning of Friday, August 4, 1944. Two of the helpers, Johannes Kleiman and Victor Kugler, were also arrested. Kugler later noted that \"Margot was weeping silently\" during the arrest. Miep Gies avoided arrest because she recognized that Silberbauer was speaking with a Viennese accent. \"You are of Vienna. I'm of Vienna, too,\" she said to him. Recognizing their shared heritage as Austrians from Vienna, Karl Silberbauer berated her for helping Jews, but ultimately, he permitted her to remain at the office so long as she promised she wouldn't flee. In this Miep Gies interview, she discusses the raid.\n\n\n\n\n\nActor Daniel Donskoy portrays SS-Hauptscharf\u00fchrer Karl Josef Silberbauer, who commanded the raid on Otto Frank's business and secret annex at Prinsengracht 263.\n\nDid Miep Gies go to the Nazi headquarters in Amsterdam and attempt to buy back the Franks' freedom?\n\nYes. The A Small Light fact-check verifies that in a desperate attempt to free the eight people she had been hiding, as well as two helpers who'd been arrested, Miep Gies put her life at great risk by going to the headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst in Amsterdam, the intelligence arm of the SS. However, her efforts were ineffective.\n\n\n\nThe only hopeful sign was that helper Johannes Kleiman was released a few weeks later at the end of September 1944. He was let go as a result of his poor health. Miep, along with the other helpers, kept the business going as they awaited the return of Otto Frank and his family.\n\nWere the Franks sent on the very last train from the Netherlands to Auschwitz?\n\nYes. Part of what makes the Frank family's story so heartbreaking is that they survived in hiding for more than two years before the annex was raided by Dutch police officers on August 4, 1944. After spending a few days in prison, they were put on a train to the Westerbork transit camp. A few weeks later, they were sent on the very last train to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp on September 3, 1944. In fact, they had still been in hiding when the Allies stormed the beaches of Normandy a few months prior in June. World War II in Europe would come to an end in May of the following year with Germany's surrender.\n\n\n\nOn the night of November 1, 1944, Anne and Margot Frank were loaded onto a train with other prisoners and sent to the overcrowded Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Anne Frank died at Bergen-Belsen in February or March 1945 from spotted typhus. Her sister Margot passed away a couple of days prior, also from spotted typhus. Just over a month later, the camp was liberated by the British.\n\nDid Miep Gies save Anne Frank's diary after the family's arrest?\n\nYes. While the Frank family was in hiding, Miep Gies was aware that Anne Frank was keeping a diary. After the raid, Miep Gies went to the secret annex at Prinsengracht 263 to see if she could gather some personal belongings to keep for the Franks. It was then that she found Anne Frank's notebooks and papers lying on the floor. Miep kept Anne's writings in a drawer of her desk, intending to give them back to Anne when she returned. If it were not for Miep Gies, the world would not know the story of Anne Frank.\n\n\n\nWhile exploring the A Small Light true story, we discovered that after it became apparent in mid-July 1945 that Anne Frank had died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, Miep gave Anne's writings to Otto Frank, who had survived and appeared on Miep's doorstep in early June 1945. Otto subsequently lived with Miep and Jan Gies for over seven years. -AnneFrank.org\n\n\n\n\n\nAnne Frank (left) is portrayed by Billie Boullet (right) in the National Geographic miniseries.\n\nWhen did Miep Gies read Anne Frank's diary?\n\nWhile holding onto Anne's writings in hopes that she would return, Miep did not read them. In fact, when the diary was published in 1947, Miep still hesitated to read it. It was only after the prolonged urging of Anne's father, Otto Frank, that Miep finally gave in and read the book. \"I was glad that I had not read the book straight after the arrest, (...) when it was sitting in my desk drawer,\" said Miep. \"If I had, I would have had to burn it, because it was too dangerous for the people Anne wrote about.\" -Anne Frank Magazine, 1998\n\n\n\nIn a January 28, 1944 diary entry, Anne Frank expressed her astonishment at the fact that there were so many people willing to assist in saving the lives of others. \"The best example of this is our own helpers, who have managed to pull us through so far and will hopefully bring us safely to shore, because otherwise they'll find themselves sharing the fate of those they're trying to protect. Never have they uttered a single word about the burden we must be, never have they complained that we're too much trouble.\"\n\nDid Miep Gies have any children?\n\nYes. Miep and Jan Gies had a son named Paul, who was born in 1950, half a decade after the war ended.\n\nHow much research did Bel Powley do to prepare for her role as Miep Gies?\n\nPowley said that prior to filming, she traveled to Amsterdam and took a private tour of the actual annex where the Frank family hid. She also traversed the same roads that Miep did during World War II. She told the Jewish Journal, \"I did Miep\u2019s bicycle route just to get a feel of it, and I did the cycle ride that she took Margot [Frank] on when she took Margot to the hiding place through the checkpoint.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish actress Bel Powley (left) visited Amsterdam and the secret annex in order to prepare to portray Miep Gies (right) in the Nat Geo miniseries."}, {"url": "https://collections.ushmm.org/search/catalog/irn509066", "page_content": "Steen Fischer papers\n\nDocument | Accession Number: 2001.237 Document | Accession Number: 2001.237\n\nContains three Danish passports issued to Steen Fischer, a letter dated 1943 October 21, from Mr. Fischer to the Royal British Legation in Sweden asking to join the British military forces; and a response dated 1943 October 26.

He responded to an ad looking for work placed in the newspaper by Edward Budd. Edward Budd was an 18 year-old boy determined to make something of himself. Frank Howard arrived at Budd\u2019s doorstep with a job offer. He stated that he would like to have Budd come work with him at his farm, telling the story of his six children and how his wife had left them.\n\nEdward was looking forward to having a job and providing for his family, and Howard even offered a job to Budd\u2019s friend, Willie. Howard planned to come pick them up a few days later to take them back to his farm to begin work. When Howard didn\u2019t show, he provided a hand-written note explaining that he would be in touch in a few days. He came over for a visit the following morning and the family invited him to stay for lunch. During his visit, Howard spotted Budd\u2019s younger sister, Gracie. Explaining that he had to attend a birthday party before he could take the boys to the farm, he asked if Gracie would like to join him. With his gracious attitude and friendly nature, the Budds gave Gracie permission to attend the party. That evening, Howard did not return and Gracie vanished. The family reported her disappearance to the local police and an investigation began.\n\nNo leads were discovered, partially because Frank Howard didn\u2019t exist. The Budd family received a letter with a description of the mutilation and murder of little Gracie. The note matched the handwriting from the original note sent to them earlier. During the time of the investigation and before the letter was received, another child vanished.\n\nBilly Gaffney, a four year-old boy playing with his neighbor, who was also named Billy, disappeared and the three year-old Billy stated that \u201cthe boogey man\u201d took Billy Gaffney. The police didn\u2019t take the statement to heart, and instead ignored it. Shortly after the disappearance of Billy Gaffney, another little boy also disappeared. Eight year-old Francis McDonnell was playing on the porch with his mother when a grey-haired, frail, old man walked down the street muttering to himself. The mother noticed his awkward demeanor but did not report anything. Later that day, while Francis was playing at the park, his friends noticed that he walked into the woods with an elderly grey-haired man. When his family noticed that he was missing, they organized a search. Francis was found under some branches in the woods, badly beaten and strangled with his suspenders.\n\nThe manhunt for the \u201cgrey man\u201d began but despite many efforts, he vanished. The letter that was received by the Budd family was investigated and was found to contain an emblem of the New York Private Chauffeur\u2019s Benevolent Association (NYPCBA). All of the members were required to obtain a handwriting test for comparison to the letters from Howard. A janitor came forward to admit that he had taken some sheets of paper and left them in his old rooming house. The landlady was able to confirm that an old man matching the description had lived there for two months and had only checked out a few days earlier. The former tenant was identified as Albert H. Fish. The landlady also mentioned that he wanted her to hold a letter that would be arriving from his son. Detectives intercepted the letter at the post office and were contacted by the landlady that he would be coming to get his letter. The lead detective was able to capture Mr. Fish.\n\nMany confessions and testimonies were heard by law enforcement and psychiatrists. Mr. Fish described how he wanted to lure Edward Budd and his friend Willie to his farm to kill them. However, once he laid eyes on Gracie, he changed his mind and desperately wanted to kill her. He took Gracie to the train station and purchased a one-way ticket for her. After the ride to the country side, he took her to a house. While at the house he told Gracie to wait outside and she picked flowers. He went to the second floor of the house and removed all of his clothes. When he called for Gracie to come upstairs she was frightened by him and called out for her mother. Mr. Fish choked her to death. Following her death, he decapitated her and cut up her body. He took parts with him when he left, wrapped in newspaper. Police were able to locate the remains of Gracie based on his confession.\n\nAlbert Fish had many run-ins with police in his lifetime. However, each time charges were dismissed. He discussed the details of the murder of Billy Gaffney, describing how he tied him up and beat him. He even admitted to drinking his blood and making a stew out of his body parts. His attitude was not like those of people with psychosis. He was calm and reserved, which was out of the ordinary. He confessed that he wanted to inflict pain and have pain inflicted on him. He taunted and preyed on children, mostly boys. He also had a compulsion to write and send obscene letters. An x-ray determined that he placed needles into the region between his anus and scrotum, and at least 29 needles were discovered.\n\nIn trial, the defense argued that he was legally insane. They used many descriptions and testimonies to prove to the jury that he was mentally ill. However, the jury didn\u2019t believe this. He was considered to be a \u201cpsychopathic personality without a psychosis\u201d and he was found guilty after 10 days of trial.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nNY Daily News Article \u2013 Albert Fish\n\nBack to Crime Library"}], "Alfred Fischer was executed in 1945.": [{"url": "https://peoplepill.com/people/alfred-fischer/", "page_content": "The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its variants were the highest awards in the military and paramilitary forces of Nazi Germany during World War II. The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded for a wide range of reasons and across all ranks, from a senior commander for skilled leadership of his troops in battle to a low-ranking soldier for a single act of extreme gallantry. A total of 7,321 awards were made between its first presentation on 30 September 1939 and its last bestowal on 17 June 1945. This number is based on the analysis and acceptance of the order commission of the Association of Knight's Cross Recipients (AKCR). Presentations were made to members of the three military branches of the Wehrmacht\u2014the Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy) and Luftwaffe (Air Force)\u2014as well as the Waffen-SS, the Reichsarbeitsdienst (RAD\u2014Reich Labour Service) and the Volkssturm (German national militia). There were also 43 foreign recipients of the award.\n\nThese recipients are listed in the 1986 edition of Walther-Peer Fellgiebel's book, Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 \u2014 The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945. Fellgiebel was the former chairman and head of the order commission of the AKCR. In 1996, the second edition of this book was published with an addendum delisting 11 of these original recipients. Author Veit Scherzer has cast doubt on a further 193 of these listings. The majority of the disputed recipients had received the award in 1945, when the deteriorating situation of Germany during the final days of World War II left a number of nominations incomplete and pending in various stages of the approval process.\n\nListed here are the 280 Knight's Cross recipients whose last name starts with \"F\". Scherzer has challenged the validity of 12 of these listings. Georg-Wolfgang Feller, a 13th doubted recipient, is listed by the AKCR. However, the AKCR itself challenges his listing. The recipients are ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank at the time the Knight's Cross was awarded.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and its higher grades were based on four separate enactments. The first enactment, Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573 of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz), the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and the Grand Cross of the Iron Cross (Gro\u00dfkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes). Article 2 of the enactment mandated that the award of a higher class be preceded by the award of all preceding classes. As the war progressed, some of the recipients of the Knight's Cross distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub), was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, were based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub und Schwertern) and the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten). At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten), based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11 of 29 December 1944, became the final variant of the Knight's Cross authorized.\n\nRecipients\n\nService Number of presentations Posthumous presentations Heer 179 13 Kriegsmarine 17 0 Luftwaffe 65 7 Waffen-SS 19 1\n\nThe Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces) kept separate Knight's Cross lists, one for each of the three military branches, Heer (Army), Kriegsmarine (Navy), Luftwaffe (Air Force) and Waffen-SS.

Of the 280 awards made to servicemen whose last name starts with \"F\", 25 were later awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and three the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords; 21 presentations were made posthumously.

The trials began in November, 1945 and on October 1, 1946, the IMT rendered its judgment on twenty-one top officials of the Third Reich. The IMT sentenced most of the accused to death or to extensive prison terms and acquitted three. The IMT also convicted three of the groups, the Nazi leadership corps, the SS (including the SD), and the Gestapo. Three groups were acquitted of collective war crimes charges, but this did not relieve individual members of those groups from conviction and punishment under the Denazification program. Members of the three convicted groups were subject to apprehension and trial as war criminals by the national, military, and occupation courts of the four allied powers. And, even though individual members of the convicted groups might be acquitted of war crimes, they still remained subject to trial under the Denazification program.\n\nWar Criminals Convicted by the IMT.\n\nBormann, Martin\n\nDonitz, Karl\n\nFrank, Hans\n\nFrick, Wilhelm\n\nFritzsche, Hans\n\nFunk, Walther\n\nGoering, Hermann\n\nHess, Rudolph\n\nJodl, Alfred\n\nKaltenbrunner, Ernst\n\nKeitel, Wilhelm\n\nKrupp, Gustav\n\nLey, Robert\n\nRaeder, Erich Rosenberg, Alfred\n\nSauckel, Fritz\n\nSchacht, Hjalmar\n\nSeyss-Inquart, Arthur\n\nSpeer, Albert\n\nStreicher, Julius\n\nvon Neurath, Konstantin\n\nvon Papen, Franz\n\nvon Schirach, Baldur\n\nvon Ribbentrop, Joachim\n\nTrials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals under Allied Control Council (ACC) Law No. 10, October 1946-April 1949.\n\n\n\nOriginally, a second international trial at Nuremberg was to have focused primarily on the activities of German finance and industry during the Third Reich. The so-called \"industrialists trial,\" was widely regard as of equal importance to the prosecution of the Nazi and SS high command. The United States vetoed this plan, declaring in the autumn of 1945 that it would refuse to participate in any further international trials and would hold separate prosecutions on its own. This led to the four-power, Allied Control Council (ACC) for Germany to authorize each of the powers to hold subsequent trials on its own, in its zone of occupation.\n\nPursuant to this authority the Control Council adopted on December 20, 1945, Law No. 10. Based upon the same principals as those underlying the work of the IMT, the law defined \"war crimes\" and \"crimes against humanity\" and identified those who should be held responsible for such acts. 2 The law specified that any person who \"held a high political, civil, or military position in Germany or one of its Allies, cobelligerents or satellites or held a high position in the financial, industrial or economic life of any such country\" was deemed to have committed a crime against peace, namely planning and executing an aggressive war in violation of treaties. Thus, membership in an organization like the SS became sufficient cause for arrest. But Law No. 10 did not require that all persons considered as criminals be prosecuted; it simply gave the commanders of the occupation forces authority to bring charges as warranted .\n\nBased on the authority granted them by the ACC, the United States occupation authorities set about identifying additional war criminals to be tried in these subsequent trials. Eventually, 185 individuals were arraigned to stand trial as war criminals. They would be tried, beginning in October 1946, in twelve separate proceedings, grouped either by type of crime or by organization. These consisted of four cases in which the defendants belonged to various branches of the SS, officials of three industrial organizations (the Krupp works, I.G. Farben company, and the Flick combine), three cases of German generals, and two cases included mainly members of former German ministries. 177 stood trial (with four committing suicide and four being physically unable to stand trial). The last of the cases was completed in April. 1949.\n\nAfter taking into consideration the commutation of sentences ordered on January 31, 1951, by the United States High Commissioner for Germany, 13 defendants received the death penalty, eight were imprisoned for life, seventy-seven served terms of imprisonment, thirty-three were released on the basis of time already served, and one received a medical parole.
