He appeared at Basketball City in New York to accept his award on Monday, just beating out a pair of Philadelphia 76ers rookies, Dario Saric and Joel Embiid.\n\n\u201cI think it's an example for guys who are told they're too short, they're not athletic enough, they're not real point guards, they're not real shooting guards,\u201d Brogdon said upon winning the award on TNT. \u201cI just think it's an important message for people to see. That it can be done, that it takes a lot of hard work, it takes a lot of sacrifice and a lot of good decisions.\u201d\n\nThe 24-year-old Brogdon averaged 10 points and four assists on 40 percent three-point shooting to help power the Bucks to a 42-40 record for the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference. Those numbers improved after the All-Star break as he made his campaign for Rookie of the Year, averaging 12 points on 49 percent shooting, consistently supporting Giannis Antetokounmpo in the backcourt.\n\nBrogdon shot 47.6 percent from downtown in the playoffs as Milwaukee pushed the Toronto Raptors in the first round before losing in six games.\n\nRelated Malcolm Brogdon asked the Bucks to donate his Rookie of the Year campaign budget to charity\n\nEmbiid was the runaway favorite for Rookie of the Year before a meniscus tear required a season-ending surgery. In 31 games, the 76ers big man averaged 20 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.5 blocks, shooting 36.7 percent from three. Embiid posted his incredible numbers on a minutes restriction, averaging only 25.4 minutes in his time on the floor.\n\nAfter Embiid\u2019s injury and the trade of Ersan Ilyasova, Saric came on as a force for the 76ers. He averaged 12.8 points but came alive after the trade deadline, leading Philly with 17.3 points and 7.3 rebounds per game.\n\nBut it was Brogdon who came out on top in an unusually light Rookie of the Year race. Brogdon started only 28 of his 75 games, but the level-headed rookie, drafted No. 36 overall, still came out as the best one. The top pick, Ben Simmons, missed the whole year, most of the lottery picks underachieved, and the other two contenders for the award were from different drafts entirely. In another year, Brogdon wouldn\u2019t have had a chance \u2014 but this year he did, and he\u2019s your 2017 Rookie of the Year."}, {"url": "https://www.celticsblog.com/2023/6/9/23754736/boston-celtics-derrick-white-malcolm-brogdon-trade-rumors-marcus-smart-dennis-schroder", "page_content": "Heading into the 2021-22 season, the Boston Celtics had a single starting-caliber point guard on the roster, Marcus Smart, and it was set to be his first full-time season. Dennis Schroder and Payton Pritchard rounded out the position on the bench, but it was clear Boston needed more help. Over the next year, they added two more high-level point guards to the mix, creating a three-headed monster of Smart, Derrick White, and Malcolm Brogdon.\n\nIn the Celtics\u2019 full season with White and Brogdon in tow, they fell short of their ultimate goal, losing to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals. But how did White and Brogdon perform?\n\nDerrick White\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the season, White was tremendous for the Celtics in every sense of the word. Newly-minted head coach Joe Mazzulla decided to roll with him as a starter over Robert Williams, and while the prioritized offensive identity rubbed some people the wrong way, the results spoke for themselves.\n\nWhite was far better as a starter than coming off the bench. He appeared in all 82 games for the Celtics, notched a career-high three-point percentage at 38.1% (outside of his low-volume rookie season), and was named to the All-Defensive Second Team, leading all NBA guards in blocks.\n\nHis regular season showed why Brad Stevens invested so many assets into trading for him, but the playoffs elevated his Bostonian status to the next level.\n\nThere was a case to be made that White was Boston\u2019s third-best player in the regular season, and in the first round of the playoffs, he confirmed that thought. From the jump, White was phenomenal. He earned MVP chants at TD Garden against the Atlanta Hawks. He had a few down games mixed in, but he was one of Boston\u2019s most consistent players in the postseason.\n\nAnd while it will likely be erased from history due to Boston\u2019s Game 7 loss to the Heat, White\u2019s game-winner in Game 6 took the world by storm for 48 hours.\n\nWhite established himself as the best guard on the roster this past season, and while Smart\u2019s place in the starting lineup likely won\u2019t change, there\u2019s a real case for White to be a full-time starter. Smart is a better playmaker and overall defender and Brogdon is a better shooter, but White proved to be the most complete guard. Running double-big lineups may be the best way to maximize Boston\u2019s potential as a defensive unit, but taking White out of the starting group should not be the way to do that.\n\nAs the Celtics explore potential trade options this summer, the guard rotation will be looked at through a magnifying glass. Having White, Smart, and Brogdon together on the roster could be redundant, especially considering the team\u2019s lack of wing depth. And with the season White just put forth, he should be the last to be considered in trade talks.\n\nMalcolm Brogdon\n\nLast summer, Boston\u2019s trade for Malcolm Brogdon seemed like the perfect move. They had just lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals and desperately needed another guy who could set up the offense and create for himself.\n\nBrogdon brought that to the table.\n\nFor the first time in his career, Brogdon was asked to come off the bench, which worked to perfection. The lessened load allowed Brogdon to stay healthy, which led to him playing in the second-most games of his career (67) and the most since his rookie season.\n\nHe churned out efficient performance after efficient performance, ending the season as the league\u2019s fourth-best three-point shooter (44.4%). By year\u2019s end, he was named the Sixth Man of the Year.\n\nEverything seemed to work perfectly until it didn\u2019t.\n\nBoston brought Brogdon on board in part for his shot creation, but arguably the biggest reason was because of his playmaking. Smart was the only true playmaker they had on the roster the season prior, and Brogdon was coming off two-straight seasons of averaging nearly six assists per game.\n\nAnd while he put up 3.7 assists per game in his bench role, that number dipped to 2.9 in the playoffs, as Brogdon turned into another score-first option on a team full of them. Rather than being the playmaking point guard Boston desperately needed alongside Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, Brogdon consistently called his own number, acting as the Kemba Walker and Kyrie Irving-type score-first guy that failed to help the Celtics get over the hump.\n\nHis lack of awareness for the lob pass was brutal, consistently missing Robert Williams and others rolling to the rim. He was also a terrible finisher at the rim, something that carried over from his otherwise rock-solid regular season run. Brogdon shot 50.0% within five feet of the basket in the playoffs; only five players shot worse than him from that distance, and four were eliminated in the first round. (And the other was James Harden.)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say Brogdon didn\u2019t have value. His three-point shooting was crucial against the Philadelphia 76ers. But Mazzulla often wrongly used the logic of \u201cgood three-point shooting equals more minutes.\u201d Brogdon\u2019s shooting was important, but as the only guard on the floor or the primary ball-handler, he left much to be desired in the playmaking department.\n\nBrogdon tore a tendon in his arm and had been playing through it against the Heat. Unfortunately, his shooting stroke was gone. He eventually earned fewer and fewer minutes until he was completely unplayable, which was far from his own fault.\n\nHis struggles all culminated at the worst time. He played just 7:05 in Game 7 against the Heat but was a -15 \u2014 the third-worst plus/minus on the team.\n\nReflecting on the Brogdon trade nearly a year later, it\u2019s hard to say it was a loss. They gave up zero every-night players, and while having their first-round pick in this year\u2019s draft would have been nice, Brogdon holds more value than that.\n\nAt the same time, Brogdon didn\u2019t provide the Celtics with what they should have wanted. His three-point success and shot creation was helpful. Throughout the regular season and postseason, he was a consistent source of offense. But it was a one-man offense. Too often did Brogdon call his own number instead of throwing an easy lob to Williams or kicking the ball to Tatum or Brown. Rather than acting as the pass-first point guard many were expecting and hoping he\u2019d be, Brogdon turned into a better-shooting, upgraded version of Schroder, a player who clearly did not fit the Celtics needs. Obviously, Brogdon fit the Celtics much better than Schroder did, but at the end of the day, his score-first mentality won\u2019t help elevate the Celtics into the championship team they can be at their peak.\n\nNow, heading into a summer of potential changes, Brogdon seems like the obvious choice of the three guards to be traded. Smart\u2019s defense and playmaking are more valuable at the guard spot than Brogdon\u2019s shooting, especially since the Celtics could trade him for shooting at a more convenient position. Meanwhile, White\u2019s all-around game has him in place to be Boston\u2019s best guard next year.\n\nBrogdon\u2019s first season with the Celtics wasn\u2019t a failure, but it wasn\u2019t what the team necessarily needed. Trading him for an upgrade on the wing or an extra backup big could be the team\u2019s next move, and with how much Brogdon makes combined with Boston\u2019s need to re-sign Grant Williams, it makes all the more sense.\n\nThe Celtics are in a much better spot at the point guard position now than they were two seasons ago. Going from Walker, Smart, and Brad Wanamaker to Smart, White, and Brogdon is a massive improvement. But it\u2019s gotten to the point where their guard play could be too overwhelming.\n\nIn Game 1 against the Heat, Mazzulla rolled out an eight-man rotation with White, Brogdon, and Payton Pritchard off the bench. Three guards.\n\nTrading one of the three guards for added wing depth should be an avenue the Celtics seriously consider this summer, and Brogdon could be the clear choice to be thrown in said deal.\n\nBoth White and Brogdon had solid seasons. White was Boston\u2019s third-best player by the end of the season. But the flaws of the Sixth Man of the Year, injury or not, overshadowed his successes."}, {"url": "https://cdn.nba.com/news/2022-23-sixth-man-of-year-malcolm-brogdon", "page_content": "BOSTON (AP) \u2014 The Boston Celtics asked Malcolm Brogdon to learn a new role.

He returned for Game 6 after missing Game 5 with the injury."}, {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/celtics-malcolm-brogdon-named-nbas-sixth-man-year/story?id=98741389", "page_content": "Boston Celtics guard Malcolm Brogdon, the key offseason addition for the defending Eastern Conference champions, was named the winner of the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year Award on Thursday night.\n\nBrogdon edged out New York Knicks guard Immanuel Quickley for the award, garnering 60 out of 100 first-place votes and compiling 408 total points, ahead of Quickley's 34 first-place votes and 326 total points in what is likely to be one of the closer races in this year's slate of awards.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis (six first-place votes, 97 total points) was the third finalist for the honor, while another seven players received at least one vote.\n\n\"This is such an honor. It's definitely been a transition for me, coming from Indiana to Boston,\" Brogdon said in an interview on TNT's \"Inside The NBA\" as part of the award announcement. \"But I'm with a great organization, I have great teammates, a great coaching staff. Joe [Mazzulla] has taken over and done a great job, so I want to thank those guys.\"\n\nQuickley, who averaged 14.9 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists this season for New York, was part of a second unit that was a constant in the Knicks' success this season under coach Tom Thibodeau -- especially after the arrival of swingman Josh Hart prior to February's trade deadline.\n\nThat second unit helped power New York to the fifth seed in Eastern Conference, putting the Knicks back in the playoffs for the second time in three years -- and just the second time overall in the past decade.\n\nBoston acquired Brogdon last summer to give the Celtics another downhill offensive attacker and creator after they saw their offense bog down at times in last year's playoffs, particularly in their NBA Finals loss to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAfter starting every game he played the previous four years with the Indiana Pacers and Bucks, Brogdon came off the bench for all 67 games he played this season for Boston.\n\n\"I had the pleasure of playing with Giannis [Antetokounmpo], one of the best players in the world,\" Brogdon said. \"For me coming out of college, I was an All-American, I had good accolades, but you have to check your ego at the door, especially when I got to Milwaukee. Then I went to Indiana, and me and [ Domantas Sabonis] are running the show there, and my last two years there weren't super successful.\n\n\"So for me, that was another gut check for me, in understanding maybe I'm not a No. 1 guy. But I can be a No. 2, 3 or 4, and then coming to Boston, playing behind [ Jayson Tatum] and [ Jaylen Brown] and these guys, proven All-Stars and soon-to-be All-NBA guys, it's been a good fit for me.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old guard did just that for the Celtics, averaging 14.9 points, 4.2 rebounds and 3.7 assists while shooting 48% overall and 44% from 3-point range in helping the Celtics finish with the NBA's second-best record behind the Bucks.\n\nBrogdon also becomes the second player to win both Sixth Man of the Year and Rookie of the Year, joining Mike Miller with that distinction.\n\nBrogdon's being named Sixth Man of the Year marked the fourth NBA award to be handed out in as many nights, after Sacramento Kings coach Mike Brown was named the league's Coach of the Year on Wednesday, De'Aaron Fox was named its inaugural Clutch Player of the Year on Tuesday and Memphis Grizzlies forward Jaren Jackson Jr. was named Defensive Player of the Year on Monday.\n\nThe league is expected to announce another round of its season-long honors next week."}]}
