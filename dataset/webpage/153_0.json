We were a little bit short of training, so I didn\u2019t want him to overdo and overpush. In the heats, we had a strategy of just doing the first 100 at about 75-80 percent, get a lead, then cool it and make sure he\u2019s in the top 16 for the semi-finals. I told him that, in the semi-final, the key is still to conserve energy because we are not as fit as we want to be. So (he\u2019ll) swim through and, in the last 20-25 metres, shut it down and make sure that you qualify for the final.\n\nCome second (and) let Laszlo Cseh from Hungary pass you. I had to insist that there was no medal in the semi-final. It was more important that he saved every bit of energy for the final. He listened and he did everything to perfection. George Bovell III (GB): I was preparing myself for the struggle of my life coming up, the 200 (metre) IM. I want to give you a quote, to describe how the 200m IM is. It\u2019s about holding up a heavy weight that gets heavier and heavier with every passing second, and it crushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re maintaining that impossible rhythm of exertion while executing mastery of technique, not one but all four strokes, and the transitions between the strokes. Total exhaustion must come long before the end of the race. You must have a really strong mind to force the body to hold on that rhythm and survive, to keep going, without drowning. That\u2019s what the 200m IM is all about.\n\nIn the heats, I really played it cool. In the semi-final, I\u2019m stacked up against a man I expect to beat to get a medal. Swimming is not only about physical condition, there is a lot of mind games that happen. I could have pushed and beat him. In the home leg, I slowed down and gave him a false sense of power over me, for him to feel like he broke (my spirit). I had to pull out all of the tricks in my book because my body was like 60 percent, because of my shoulder. That was a tactic that paid off well in the final.\n\nBovell III finished third in the second semi-final, in a time of two minutes 0.31 seconds, trailing Cseh (1:59.65) and Brazil\u2019s Thiago Pereira (2:00.07).\n\nAR: George qualified for the final, to be in lane two. We were going against Michael Phelps, (Ryan) Lochte and Cseh. In swimming, you have 25 minutes before the final where they\u2019ll go into a \u2018ready\u2019 room. Just before I was to send him down into the room, I was seeing nervousness. I tried different things but I had to be careful because, in a high-pressure situation, you don\u2019t want to add too much pressure because it will bring negative results. I just wasn\u2019t getting it.\n\n(Roberts called Bahamian swimmer Jeremy Knowles, his teammate at Auburn University). I said, \u2018I want you to talk to George, I need you to get him ready, he\u2019s looking a little nervous\u2019. Jeremy took aside and I went out of earshot. I saw Jeremy take out a marker that he had in his pocket and he drew something on the inside of his right bicep.\n\nWhatever he did, I saw this look of confidence, of self-esteem, of relaxation. George looked at me and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019. He went and had the swim of a lifetime.\n\nGB: This is everything that you wanted. You have a little voice that comes up in the back of your mind that tells you \u2018don\u2019t mess this up\u2019. Before the final, everyone must go into a room, a very small room where you wait about 20 minutes. It\u2019s very intense in this room. I was preparing myself since I had the injury, to lay my life on the line. A friend of mine came up to me and drew this hammer on my bicep.\n\nI had a reputation (and was) called the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019. If you\u2019re racing against somebody and you are very tired, and you know the other person is very tired too, and you speed up, even though you cannot sustain that acceleration, eventually what starts to happen is that the person you\u2019re racing against, who\u2019s looking over at you, they say \u2018whey boy, George he\u2019s fresh\u2019 and they eventually give up, and you break their spirit.\n\nWhen they have given up and drop back, then you can relax the pace. When you break somebody\u2019s spirit like that, in practice, that\u2019s called \u2018dropping the hammer of justice\u2019. I used to do this to people.\n\nAR: His normal freestyle split could have 28.16, it was 29.0, but it was still good enough to give him that bronze medal. Guess who he beat for the bronze medal? The very said Laszlo Cseh who, the day before, he had allowed him to pass. George made history, it was a proud effort. It was the hammer of justice which was drawn on his bicep by Knowles which brought him into the mental state of readiness, to perform. The hammer of justice represented how George used to train with his teammates when they were under pressure. George\u2019s father was the manager and I was the coach, we fell down in the pool deck, hugging up. All the countries were so happy because they love when small countries get on the podium because, in swimming, it\u2019s very rare. It was a great time and it still goes down in history as the greatest swimming moment for TT. I was so proud of George.\n\nGB: Even though my body was physically weak, I had competed in six races already. I had doubts about my physical strength. When (Knowles) drew that marker on me, it reminded me (that) my soul is strong, I am a warrior. I was ready to lay it all out. I had to pace it, I was physically weak, I was seventh after the first (part). In the backstroke I started to dig, started to put some energy and make up some ground.\n\nI felt so weak at the end of that backstroke and I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in the final. I had a moment of weakness. In that moment of weakness comes the perfect excuse \u2013 the exhaustion, the injury. I was so tempted to take that excuse and just slow down. I didn\u2019t feel like how I hoped to feel in the Olympics final. I pushed through the pain and I kept accelerating.\n\n(Bovell III admitted that, during the turn and push-off for the breaststroke, he gained a lot of ground on his rivals).\n\nI started to push the breaststroke like a fire burning in my heart. I kept accelerating as if the end of the breaststroke was the end of the race.\n\nI moved up into second at the end of the breaststroke. Laszlo Cseh, the man next to me, I think he expected me to break. I kept my rhythm and it caused him to panic a little bit and lose his composure. I think it\u2019s because of the tactic I played in the semi-final gave me a psychological advantage over him.\n\nMy freestyle was not a strong as usual, so I kept pushing and pushing. An interesting thing happened, when I touched the wall, it showed me in second place and then the clock had me in third place, it switched places with Lochte and myself.\n\nSome people say America owns it because NBC has the tv rights, and a one-two America finish is good for the ratings. I came out of the ball with a headache, but a great sense of relief."}, {"url": "https://en-academic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/457579", "page_content": "Infobox Swimmer\n\nswimmername=George Bovell\n\n\n\n\n\nimagesize=\n\ncaption =\n\nfullname = George Bovell III\n\nnicknames =\n\nnationality = TRI\n\nstrokes = individual medley , freestyle\n\nclub =\n\ncollegeteam = Auburn Tigers\n\nbirthdate = birth date and age|1983|7|18\n\nbirthplace = Trinidad\n\ndeathdate =\n\ndeathplace =\n\nheight = 6'5\"\n\nweight =\n\nmedaltemplates=\n\nGeorge Bovell III (born July 18 , 1983 ) is the ninth person ever to win an Olympic medal for Trinidad and Tobago .

He still qualified and splashed into action in the 2008 Beijing Games (semi-final) and 2012 London Games (seventh) before hanging up his goggles and cap following a first round exit at the 2016 Rio Olympics.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Baptiste\u2019s Olympic career the release said, \u201cBaptiste will also be making five consecutive appearances in a record that saw her making her Olympic debut as part of the women\u2019s 4x100m relay team at the 2004 Athens Games when the powerful Tobago-native led off the relay team that failed to carry the baton all-the way round and were disqualified in the first round.\n\n\u201cFour years later at the 2008 Beijing edition, she reached the second round in the individual event while another baton mishap saw another disqualification in the women\u2019s 4x100m relay.\u201d\n\nShe had her best showing at the 2012 Games. \u201cBaptiste\u2019s best Olympic performance came at the 2012 London Games where she finished sixth in the final but Team TTO\u2019s women\u2019s relay woes continued with another failed trip, and in 2016 Rio, she exited at the second round.\u201d\n\nBaptiste, 34, will again line up in the women's 100m dash and women's 4x100m relay team.\n\nBaptiste is being described as the \u201cstateswoman\u201d of the TT Olympic contingent.\n\nOn Tuesday, the TTOC announced the full TT team that covers seven sporting disciplines including track and field, boxing, cycling, judo, rowing, sailing and swimming. TTOC president Brian Lewis hinted that TT may make history by naming its first women\u2019s flag-bearer for the opening ceremony.\n\n\"To date, the TTOC has never had a female flag-bearer at the opening ceremony of a Summer Olympic Games,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"It is my sincere hope that a female athlete will be chosen by the chef de mission Lovie Santana to carry the TT flag during the opening ceremony in Tokyo 2020.\"\n\nTT will have Santana, the experienced TTOC senior administrative officer, at the helm while TTOC project officer, athletes services and programmes, Rheeza Grant will serve as TT's covid19 liaison officer. TT will also rely on a strong medical staff of nine led by Dr Rudranath Ramsawak.\n\nAfter the Games were rescheduled due to the pandemic, Lewis said, \"The TTOC acknowledges the perseverance, dedication and determination of every athlete who tried their best to qualify for the covid19 pandemic impacted games, the first Olympic Games in history to be postponed.\"\n\nThis year's Olympic Games also hold special significance for the TTOC as it coincides with its 75-year anniversary."}, {"url": "https://newsday.co.tt/2020/04/08/bovell-relies-on-the-hammer-of-justice/", "page_content": "Bovell relies on the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019\n\nGeorge Bovell III, showing off the 'hammer of justice' -\n\nGEORGE BOVELL III was TT\u2019s lone Olympic medallist at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece.\n\nBovell III, then 21 years of age, copped bronze in the men\u2019s 200-metre individual medley, becoming the first, and only, TT swimmer, to medal at the Games.\n\nRecently, Bovell III and his coach Anil Roberts spoke about the journey they both shared \u2013 leading up to the 2004 Games, as well as the event itself.\n\nHere is Part Two of the journey\u2026\n\nAnil Roberts (AR): We moved on to the 200IM a few days later. We were a little bit short of training, so I didn\u2019t want him to overdo and overpush. In the heats, we had a strategy of just doing the first 100 at about 75-80 percent, get a lead, then cool it and make sure he\u2019s in the top 16 for the semi-finals. I told him that, in the semi-final, the key is still to conserve energy because we are not as fit as we want to be. So (he\u2019ll) swim through and, in the last 20-25 metres, shut it down and make sure that you qualify for the final.\n\nCome second (and) let Laszlo Cseh from Hungary pass you. I had to insist that there was no medal in the semi-final. It was more important that he saved every bit of energy for the final. He listened and he did everything to perfection. George Bovell III (GB): I was preparing myself for the struggle of my life coming up, the 200 (metre) IM. I want to give you a quote, to describe how the 200m IM is. It\u2019s about holding up a heavy weight that gets heavier and heavier with every passing second, and it crushes you.\n\nYou\u2019re maintaining that impossible rhythm of exertion while executing mastery of technique, not one but all four strokes, and the transitions between the strokes. Total exhaustion must come long before the end of the race. You must have a really strong mind to force the body to hold on that rhythm and survive, to keep going, without drowning. That\u2019s what the 200m IM is all about.\n\nIn the heats, I really played it cool. In the semi-final, I\u2019m stacked up against a man I expect to beat to get a medal. Swimming is not only about physical condition, there is a lot of mind games that happen. I could have pushed and beat him. In the home leg, I slowed down and gave him a false sense of power over me, for him to feel like he broke (my spirit). I had to pull out all of the tricks in my book because my body was like 60 percent, because of my shoulder. That was a tactic that paid off well in the final.\n\nBovell III finished third in the second semi-final, in a time of two minutes 0.31 seconds, trailing Cseh (1:59.65) and Brazil\u2019s Thiago Pereira (2:00.07).\n\nAR: George qualified for the final, to be in lane two. We were going against Michael Phelps, (Ryan) Lochte and Cseh. In swimming, you have 25 minutes before the final where they\u2019ll go into a \u2018ready\u2019 room. Just before I was to send him down into the room, I was seeing nervousness. I tried different things but I had to be careful because, in a high-pressure situation, you don\u2019t want to add too much pressure because it will bring negative results. I just wasn\u2019t getting it.\n\n(Roberts called Bahamian swimmer Jeremy Knowles, his teammate at Auburn University). I said, \u2018I want you to talk to George, I need you to get him ready, he\u2019s looking a little nervous\u2019. Jeremy took aside and I went out of earshot. I saw Jeremy take out a marker that he had in his pocket and he drew something on the inside of his right bicep.\n\nWhatever he did, I saw this look of confidence, of self-esteem, of relaxation. George looked at me and I said, \u2018let\u2019s go\u2019. He went and had the swim of a lifetime.\n\nGB: This is everything that you wanted. You have a little voice that comes up in the back of your mind that tells you \u2018don\u2019t mess this up\u2019. Before the final, everyone must go into a room, a very small room where you wait about 20 minutes. It\u2019s very intense in this room. I was preparing myself since I had the injury, to lay my life on the line. A friend of mine came up to me and drew this hammer on my bicep.\n\nI had a reputation (and was) called the \u2018hammer of justice\u2019. If you\u2019re racing against somebody and you are very tired, and you know the other person is very tired too, and you speed up, even though you cannot sustain that acceleration, eventually what starts to happen is that the person you\u2019re racing against, who\u2019s looking over at you, they say \u2018whey boy, George he\u2019s fresh\u2019 and they eventually give up, and you break their spirit.\n\nWhen they have given up and drop back, then you can relax the pace. When you break somebody\u2019s spirit like that, in practice, that\u2019s called \u2018dropping the hammer of justice\u2019. I used to do this to people.\n\nAR: His normal freestyle split could have 28.16, it was 29.0, but it was still good enough to give him that bronze medal. Guess who he beat for the bronze medal? The very said Laszlo Cseh who, the day before, he had allowed him to pass. George made history, it was a proud effort. It was the hammer of justice which was drawn on his bicep by Knowles which brought him into the mental state of readiness, to perform. The hammer of justice represented how George used to train with his teammates when they were under pressure. George\u2019s father was the manager and I was the coach, we fell down in the pool deck, hugging up. All the countries were so happy because they love when small countries get on the podium because, in swimming, it\u2019s very rare. It was a great time and it still goes down in history as the greatest swimming moment for TT. I was so proud of George.\n\nGB: Even though my body was physically weak, I had competed in six races already. I had doubts about my physical strength. When (Knowles) drew that marker on me, it reminded me (that) my soul is strong, I am a warrior. I was ready to lay it all out. I had to pace it, I was physically weak, I was seventh after the first (part). In the backstroke I started to dig, started to put some energy and make up some ground.\n\nI felt so weak at the end of that backstroke and I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening in the final. I had a moment of weakness. In that moment of weakness comes the perfect excuse \u2013 the exhaustion, the injury. I was so tempted to take that excuse and just slow down. I didn\u2019t feel like how I hoped to feel in the Olympics final. I pushed through the pain and I kept accelerating.\n\n(Bovell III admitted that, during the turn and push-off for the breaststroke, he gained a lot of ground on his rivals).\n\nI started to push the breaststroke like a fire burning in my heart. I kept accelerating as if the end of the breaststroke was the end of the race.\n\nI moved up into second at the end of the breaststroke. Laszlo Cseh, the man next to me, I think he expected me to break. I kept my rhythm and it caused him to panic a little bit and lose his composure. I think it\u2019s because of the tactic I played in the semi-final gave me a psychological advantage over him.\n\nMy freestyle was not a strong as usual, so I kept pushing and pushing. An interesting thing happened, when I touched the wall, it showed me in second place and then the clock had me in third place, it switched places with Lochte and myself.\n\nSome people say America owns it because NBC has the tv rights, and a one-two America finish is good for the ratings. I came out of the ball with a headache, but a great sense of relief."}, {"url": "https://ttaquatics.org/2022/02/08/george-bovell-iii-again-recognized-as-one-of-the-fastest-men-ever-by-swimswam-and-swimmingstats/", "page_content": "As we head to yet another CARIFTA Championships we remember one of our own the greatest sprinter of all time from the region the Legendary \" King\" George Bovell III of Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nHe is ranked as the seventh fastest man of all time in the 50 metre freestyle in the Olympic sized pool with his 2009 Rome World Championships blast of of 21.20.That time also stood as a Championship record\n\nHis speed is also unmatched in the region for the 25 yards pool and the 25 metre pool."}, {"url": "https://swimswam.com/george-bovell-visionary-sport/", "page_content": "George Bovell, a name synonymous with Trinidadian swimming, recently enlisted the help of some elite friends in his quest to help inspire a younger generation of swimmers in his home region. Two-time Olympic bronze medalist for Russia, Arkady Vyatchanin (now most likely representing Serbia), Olympic gold medalist for South Africa Roland Schoeman, and World Champion New Zealander Moss Burmester joined the 2004-Olympic bronze medalist in the Caribbean for a series of free clinics using swimming as a platform to both benefit and excite young athletes.\n\nThe \u201cGeorge Bovell Dive In Free Swim Clinics 2015\u201d were held at facilities in St. James, Macoya and San Fernando over January 15-17th, with the prestigious athletes teaching training methods, skills and drills with the purpose of not only encouraging the young attendees within the sport of swimming, but by also offering up hope and inspiration as they interacted and collaborated with the participants.\n\nBovell tells SwimSwam that, \u201cthe clinics were a huge success; you all can\u2019t imagine what it meant to those kids. It\u2019s an initiative that I try to put on every year to give back to and hopefully grow the sport here.

With the building\u2019s completion targeted for June 2015, Bovell hopes the country can offer the facility to Olympic teams to use for their Rio 2016 staging camps, especially with Trinidad\u2019s temperatures and time zone not far off Rio\u2019s mark.\n\nThis vision falls directly in line with what Bovell describes as his short- and long-term mission for the sport of swimming in Trinidad and Tobago. \u201cIn the next five years, I would love to see Trinidad and Tobago hosting regional and international swimming events and have all schools offer learn-to-swim classes as part of their curriculum so that the number of unnecessary drowning deaths annually will be significantly reduced.\u201d\n\nGrowing up in the 90\u2019s and pushing through the age group ranks with what Bovell has previously described as limited knowledge, resources and opportunities, he now feels compelled to contribute to the overall improvement of swimming on all levels.

We always knew he's going to be a force to be reckoned with,\" Nesty told BBC Caribbean.com.\n\nTwenty-one-year old Bovell is ranked number two in the 200m individual medley, behind the American Michael Phelps and Anil Roberts who coaches and advises Bovell told BBC Caribbean.com he is extremely confident about the young swimmer's chances.\n\nHowever, Roberts said it is unlikely that Bovell will conquer the American at this time.\n\nHe explained that Phelps, who turned professional to concentrate solely on his swimming, has the advantage over Bovell who has to balance his school work with his training.\n\n\"I believe he has a shot but, because of the time that Phelps has to dedicate to his swimming, Phelps is the clear favourite, George is the second favourite,\" he said. \"I expect George to turn professional in two years when he graduates then the playing field will be a little more even.\"\n\nTwenty-one-year-old Janelle Atkinson is Jamaica's most successful swimmer, and ranks among the best in the region. Four years ago at the Sydney Olympics, she finished fourth in the 400 metres freestyle.\n\nShe became the first female swimmer from the Caribbean to win a medal in the Pan Am Games in 1999 when she took home three silver medals.\n\nSwansong\n\nHowever, the games in Athens will be her Olympic swansong as she has been forced into early retirement by nagging shoulder and knee injuries, which both required surgery.\n\nAnthony Nesty coaches Atkinson in Florida and he paid tribute to her determination to return to competition after her injuries.\n\n\"I think she's doing the best she can to be competitive. She's done a great job and has a great attitude,\" he said. \"We have to be real cautious so we don't push her too far where she can't recover from the training.\"\n\nDespite her proven talent and class, Nesty is less that confident about her chances of winning a medal.\n\n\"She's been through a lot, and I hope she swims well but you can never say who's going to win a medal because anything can happen.\"\n\nAndrew Mackay from the Cayman Islands kicks off the Caribbean's swimming challenge on Saturday when he takes part in the 400m individual medley.\n\nBovell and Atkinson will begin their competition on Sunday.\n\n"}, {"url": "https://www.famousdetails.com/george-bovell/", "page_content": "George Bovell (Swimmer) was born on the 18th of July, 1983.
