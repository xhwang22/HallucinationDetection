He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "http://www.polishsportshof.com/portfolio_page/billy-burkowski-burke/", "page_content": "Description\n\nInducted June 9, 2005\n\nBorn William Burkowski in Union City, Connecticut, Burke played on the PGA Tour with great success. His first tour victory came in his second year on tour winning the prestigious North-South Open in 1928. Playing with a slightly unorthodox grip because of the loss of parts of two fingers on his left hand, Burke made golfing record books when he won the 1931 U.S. Open at Inverness in Toledo. He was the first person to win a major playing steel-shafted clubs and he did it by outdueling George Von Elm in a 72-hole playoff. It was the longest playoff ever played. He won 10 times on the tour and twice finished third in the Masters. Burke was also considered one of the finest Ryder Cup team members of his era being undefeated in Ryder Cup play in 1931 and 1933. He was inducted in the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966.\n\nINDUCTION BANQUET PROGRAM STORY \u2014 June 9, 2005\n\nU.S. Open and Ryder Cup Champion\n\nBy: Tom Tarapacki\n\nNPASHF Board Member\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century there were increasing numbers of Polish immigrants in America, but not many were playing significant roles in sports. The reason for that was mainly twofold: in large part they were unfamiliar with American sports, and were too busy working to find time to play. When their children did start to play sports in large numbers in the 1920s and 1930s, they tended to gravitate to \u201cworking class\u201d sports like baseball and football. It was therefore quite surprising when, in the 1930s, the son of Polish immigrants known as Bill Burke became one of the most prominent names in the sport of golf.\n\nIn 1931 Burke \u2014 born William Burkowski in Union City Connecticut \u2014 became the first person to win a major playing with steel-shafted clubs when he won the U.S. Open. He did it by out dueling George Von Elm in the longest playoff ever played.\n\nFor many years, American golf was largely considered the domain of the wealthy, a \u201ccountry club sport\u201d like tennis or polo. It was unusual for the son of a Polish-born foundry worker to even take up the sport, much less excel at it. The story goes that 15-year-old Burkowski was with playing some friends when the caddie master at the Naugatuck Golf Club, desperate for caddies, recruited him to carry clubs for golfers. He eventually started playing the game himself. He couldn\u2019t afford clubs or a bag, so some members gave him clubs and he carried them in his hands. He kept playing despite losing the ring finger and severely injuring the little finger on his left hand while working in a local foundry. At age 16 \u201cThe Boy Marvel\u201d won the Naugatuck club championship in a driving rainstorm. Supporters bought him a golf bag so he could play in the state amateur, which he lost on the final hole. They following year, 1923, he went on to win the state amateur. That victory led to Burkowski, who anglicized his name to Burke, getting a job as a golf pro at the Mattatuck Golf Course in Waterbury.\n\nIn 1931 Burke went to the U.S. Open at the Inverness Club in Toledo. He trailed the leader, George Von Elm of California, by two strokes at the start of the 36-hole final round on Sunday, July 4th. At the end of regular play, Burke and Von Elm were tied. On Monday following day they played a 36-hole playoff to decide the title, and ended the day still tied. On Tuesday they launched another 36-hole playoff, but this time Burke ended up winning by a single stroke. After 144 holes and 589 stokes, Billy Burke was the U.S. Open champion. Burke\u2019s victory was particularly significant not only because he used steel-shafted clubs, but also because the lengthy playoff caused a change in all future playoff formats.\n\nAlthough the Open win was the high point, Burke enjoyed a fine career. He won 10 career tournaments, and finished third at the Masters twice. Burke played in 159 career PGA Tour tournaments and finished in the top 10 an amazing 80 times. He was also considered one of the finest Ryder Cup team members of his era going undefeated in the 1931 and 1933 Ryder Cups. Burke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966 and died in Florida in 1972.\n\nBilly Burke was a true pioneer, excelling in the sport of golf years before other outstanding Polish-American golfers like Ed Furgol and Bob Toski appeared on the scene."}, {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/21/archives/billy-burke-golfer-who-won-open-in-31.html", "page_content": "CLEARWATER, Fla., April 20 (UPI)\u2014Billy Burke, the professional golfer, died here yesterday after a long illness.

It remains as remarkable a tale today as it was 81 years ago.\n\nBurke -- born Burkowski -- was the son of a Polish immigrant blue-collar worker. He fell in love with golf when, as a frail 12-year-old, he caddied for the first time at Naugatuck Golf Club.\n\nHis teenage years were spent lugging bags for club members. When the rounds were finished, Burke would ask to borrow members' clubs so he could practice. At 16, playing in a driving rain, he won the club championship.\n\nUpon graduating Naugatuck High, he worked at a rubber factory and later the iron foundry, practicing his golf game when the 5 p.m. whistle blew. A foundry accident cost him two fingers on his left hand, leaving Burke with an awkward swing. Still, his golf game thrived. By 1923, he was the Connecticut amateur champion.\n\nIt all led to his historic victory at the '31 Open, held at the Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio. If a scorching heat wave wasn't enough -- temperatures exceeded 100 degrees that week -- Burke had to endure a marathon playoff with George Von Elm.\n\nThe two were tied after four rounds. Playoff rules at the time required another 36 holes. Still deadlocked, officials called for an additional 36 holes. Burke burned through 32 cigars over the grueling 144 holes, but wound up winning by a single stroke to earn the grand prize -- a whopping $1,000.\n\nRules were quickly changed to avoid a similar playoff marathon. Burke, hailed as the next Bobby Jones, returned to Naugatuck a conquering hero. He was a semifinalist at the PGA Championship later that year. But he never won another major, placing third at the Masters twice (1934 and '39) and had two more top 10 finishes at the U.S. Open.

At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.sportspundit.com/golf/golfers/7349-billy-burke", "page_content": "American golfer William John Burke or \u201cBilly\u201d as called by his friends was a professional player who was famous for his 1931 U.S. Open victory against George Von Elm.

He interviewed dozens of area golfers and related individuals for the book including; Judy Rankin, Hale Irwin, Bob Goalby, Jay Haas, Keith Foster and Tom Wargo. More recently he has written club histories for some of the oldest St. Louis clubs, including Glen Echo CC (1901), Algonquin GC (1903) and Norwood Hills CC (1922) site of the 1948 PGA. A member of the Golf Writers Association of America, Jim has published dozens of articles related to St. Louis area golf and its history. His research led him to the Foulis family and their illustrious history as part of the growth of golf in the Midwest.\n\nNWHP thanks Jim for gracious permission to reprint this article here.\n\nPlease provide a little background on the Foulis brothers.\n\nThere were five Foulis brothers, Dave, Jim, Robert, John and Simpson. Of these, all but John were golfers \u2013 though John was an expert ball maker and did work as a bookkeeper at Chicago golf from 1901 to his untimely death in 1907 \u2013 and only Simpson remained an amateur throughout his life, while the remaining three were professionals at some of the most prestigious clubs in America. They were born in St. Andrews, Scotland and lived at 166 South Street, just four blocks from the Old Course. They came to America between 1895 and 1905 and made their mark on dozens of courses and clubs from Minnesota to Missouri and from Chicago to Denver.\n\nThey are all buried at the Wheaton Cemetery, adjacent to the Chicago Golf Club, the site where most of them made their mark and where Jim and Dave spent many years as pioneers of golf in the western United States.\n\nWhat interaction did they have with Old Tom Morris?\n\nJames Foulis Sr. was the foreman for Tom Morris at his shop in St. Andrews. James Sr. was recognized as an expert clubmaker. All the boys worked at one time or another in Tom Morris\u2019 shop for their father. Their grandfather tended sheep on the Old Course when George III was King of England and prior to the war of 1812. Old Tom Morris took Robert under his wing for special attention and taught him how to make clubs, featherie balls, and about golf course design as they walked the Old Course in the evenings. He pointed out how the wind had shaped the course and how the sheep, lying against the mounds and bunkers to shield themselves from the wind, had shaped these with the help of Mother Nature.\n\nRobert\u2019s first design contract was given to him in 1889 by Old Tom for Ranfurly Castle Golf Club in Bridge of Weir, just west of Glasgow. An excellent moorlands course, it offered outstanding views of the Clyde Estuary. This was also near the home of legendary Scottish poet, Robert Burns. Following the construction of the course, the club sought out a professional for the new layout. With a personal recommendation from Old Tom, Robert was selected for that position, which he held for several years.\n\nHow and why did they come to America?\n\nIn late 1894, following the construction of America\u2019s first and oldest eighteen-hole golf course, Chicago GC, Charles Blair Macdonald wrote to Robert to come to America for the position of golf professional at his new course. Macdonald and the Foulis\u2019 had met when he was a student at St. Andrews University, where Macdonald lived with his grandfather, and had obviously thought highly of their skills. Robert, who was still under contract to Ranfurly, would not think of breaking his commitment to them, so in his place he recommended his older brother Jim. Jim had learned his golf from Old Tom as well, and had also worked for Forgan & Company. An excellent player, he and Robert had had many great matches over the Old Course.\n\nArriving in this country aboard the SS Umbria out of Liverpool on March 11, 1895, it wouldn\u2019t take long for the 24-year old to quickly make his mark. Jim immediately traveled to Chicago where he became the first golf professional at Chicago GC, and the first golf professional in the western United States.\n\nIn the summer of 1895, Jim cabled Robert that he had a contract for him to design a course in Lake Forest. Robert arrived on July 13, 1895, aboard the ship SS St. Louis by coincidence, and began work on the course over the next several months. The new Lake Forest CC opened in 1896 with their 9-hole layout. Today that course is part of Onwentsia Club.\n\nDave arrived in March 1896 and went to work with Jim at Chicago GC. In 1899 James Sr. and the rest of his family made the journey to Chicago where most lived for the remainder of their lives.\n\nWhat were Jim Foulis\u2019 and the other brothers early years like in America, both as players and as architects?\n\nIn 1895, Jim was part of the eleven men who made up the field for the first U.S. Open at Newport GC. He shot a 176, finishing third behind Horace Rawlins and Willie Dunn with Rawlins shooting a score of 173. Jim was renowned for his driving ability, and was considered one of the longest drivers of the ball in the country for years. Records of exhibitions in which he participated, often with players like Alex Smith, Jock Hutchison, Willie Hunter and others, Jim would drive greens over 300 yards from the tee.\n\nIn 1896, in the Open at Shinnecock Hills, using a gutta-percha ball, Jim shot rounds of 74 and 78 for a 152 total to win the second U.S. Open. His two-round total stood as a record until 1903 when Willie Anderson posted a 149 for his first two rounds, while winning his second of four Open titles. Jim\u2019s single round score of 74 also stood for still another year until Willie Anderson shot a 72 in 1904.\n\nRobert competed in the 1897 Open at Chicago GC, finishing in a tie for 15th, while Jim was finishing third. Jim continued to compete in the Open through 1906, with Robert competing again in 1900 and Dave in 1904.\n\nSimpson was a fine amateur and he competed in various regional and local amateur events for years, representing the Chicago GC. A banker by trade, he was a competitor at the 1904 Olympic Golf Matches at Glen Echo CC in St. Louis, where Robert was head professional. Simpson competed on the Western Golf Association team, headed by Chandler Egan, as they took on the Trans-Miss and U.S.G.A teams the day before the competition. In this \u2018practice match\u2019 the Trans-Miss team won the event. Shaking up the squad, Egan replaced several players, including Simpson, as the WGA won the team match and an Olympic Team medal was awarded to each member.\n\nJim took advantage of his newly earned reputation and he began to further his architecture career. In 1896, he traveled to St. Louis where he designed the original 9-holes for St. Louis Country Club at their original site. Seventeen years later, in 1913, St. Louis would move to their present site and the club contracted with C.B. Macdonald to design their new course.\n\nFrom 1896 through 1927, Jim continued to design courses throughout the Midwest. Some of these include; Denver CC (1902), Geneva GC (1901), DuPage County GC (1901), Lake Zurich GC (1895), Kinloch GC (1898), St. Louis Golf Club (1898), Florissant Valley CC (1899), Milwaukee CC, Newspaper GC (1900) Memphis CC (1905), Hickory Hills CC (1923), Hillmoor GC (1924) Calumet CC (1911), Hinsdale GC (1898), Meadowbrook CC (MN), Edgebrook GC (1921), Bonnie Brook GC, Burlington CC, Nippersink Manor CC, Pipe O\u2019Peace GC (1927) and Kent CC (1900). Lake Zurich, with a small membership on Chicago\u2019s north side, is a course of only 2,865 yards and, according to its members, is exactly as Mr. Foulis left it over a century ago. While many of these courses no longer exist, one can see his influence on early golf as he created courses where none had previously existed.\n\nJim collaborated with Robert, and occasionally with Dave as well, as they designed and constructed additional courses. In many of instances, Jim did the routing of the course, while the actual construction was left to Robert. These include; Glen Echo (1901), Normandie (1901), Bellerive CC (1910), Sunset CC (1917) and Wheaton GC (1909).\n\nHow did Robert end up in St. Louis while the other brothers stayed in Chicago?\n\nFollowing Robert\u2019s success at Lake Forest, C.B. Macdonald wrote a letter of recommendation for him and he traveled to Minneapolis where he built the Town & Country Club. He would also construct the original 9-holes for the Minikahda Club in 1898, and later worked with Willie Watson on the 2nd nine in 1906.\n\nRobert continued designing courses on his own, though one would believe that he was in contact with his brothers on a regular basis for their input. Robert also assumed the role of golf professional and greens keeper at many of his courses. Robert\u2019s designs include; Lake Geneva CC (1897), Meadowbrook CC (1912), Jefferson City CC (1922), Bogey Club (1910), Forest Park GC (1913), Log Cabin GC (1909), Triple A GC (1902), Ruth Park GC (1930), Riverview GC (1916).\n\nIn November 1900, Jim was contacted by Colonel George McGrew, founder of Glen Echo CC, to come to St. Louis and design the St. Louis area\u2019s first 18-hole course. Jim arrived in January 1901, with Robert alongside. Together they began to layout and construct Glen Echo on over 350 acres of pristine land. The course opened on May 25, 1901. Jim returned to Chicago, while Robert stayed on as golf professional and greens keeper. He and Jim also designed the Normandie GC, which sits adjacent to Glen Echo and at one time their borders touched. Robert left Glen Echo in 1907 and moved to Normandie. Then in 1909 he began construction of the original Bellerive CC, which opened in 1910. He moved there and remained as their head pro and greens keeper until 1942.\n\nWhat was their relationship with other architects of the day?\n\nRobert did construction for other architects, as they respected his talent in this area. One of these collaborations was with Tom Bendelow at Algonquin GC in St. Louis (1903), as Bendelow did the original 9-hole routing and then left the construction to Robert. Virtually every course built in St. Louis prior to 1930 had Robert\u2019s hand on the final layout. As a superintendent he was second to none and many clubs had him on an annual retainer to insure that their course and greens survived the often difficult St. Louis summers.\n\nJim was the head professional at Olympia Fields during the construction of their original four courses. He preceded Jack Daray Sr. as professional there by a few years, and Daray, like other professionals of the day, moonlighted as an architect and built many other Chicago area courses. Though Jim played little or no role in the actual design of Olympia Fields four courses, his presence and background must have certainly made Bendelow, Watson, and Park give their work just a little extra to gain praise from the respected Foulis.\n\nThey also had a long-standing relationship with Donald Ross. The Dornoch native spent two years at St. Andrews in 1891-92 and would have come across the Foulis\u2019 as he visited Old Tom Morris at the Old Course. He also worked at the Forgan & Company shop, likely alongside Jim Foulis. A year younger than Jim, and a year older than Robert, the three of them must have learned much from Old Tom in those days. They also competed together in the US Open in the early 1900\u2019s.\n\nAnother local Chicago architect they knew well was Herbert J. Tweedie. An original member of Chicago GC, Tweedie worked closely with C.B. Macdonald. When Chicago Golf moved from their original site in Belmont to build their new 18-hole course at Wheaton, Tweedie and others stayed at Belmont and formed a new club there. In 1898, Tweedie teamed with Robert, Jim and H.J. Whigham (Macdonald\u2019s son-in-law) as they added nine holes to the original Lake Forest Club, now renamed Onwentsia. Tweedie went on to build such outstanding Chicago courses as Exmoor, Flossmoor, Glen View, LaGrange and Midlothian. Interestingly, Tweedie was the manager for the A.G. Spalding business in Chicago, the firm that also employed Tom Bendelow as their spokesman and resident architect, but there is no evidence that Tweedie or Bendelow ever collaborated on a design.\n\nAs noted earlier, Robert worked with Willie Watson at Minikahda in 1898 and again in 1906. But for the most part, the Foulis\u2019 supported each others efforts.\n\nRobert\u2019s work was also well respected by architects not generally thought of as being Midwest designers. When Harry Colt published his 1933 book, \u2018Golf Courses: Design, Construction and Upkeep\u2019 several of Robert\u2019s architectural features were included as examples of good design features and he used Robert\u2019s illustrations in his book.\n\nBeing from St. Andrews, were they good players? Did they have a friendship with other significant players of the day?\n\nIn the 1880\u2019s, their good friends, J.H. Taylor and Harry Vardon, had come to St. Andrews to visit and stayed with the Foulis family. During a friendly match over the Old Course, Dave and Robert had beaten their guests during one of their stays. Through the years, Robert and his brothers would compete in six matches with Vardon and various partners, with Vardon ending up on the winning side only once.\n\nThey also knew Sandy Herd and James Braid, who with Taylor and Vardon were the best players in Scotland and England.\n\nSurprisingly, there is little record that they competed in The Open while at St. Andrews, though newspaper accounts have stated that they may have.\n\nWhat role did they play in the advances in technology taking place around the turn of the century?\n\nIn 1903, a few years after the development of the Haskell ball in 1900, Jim and Dave were in their shop at Chicago GC experimenting with clubs and balls. They had determined that this new ball, while more durable than the old gutties, did not fly very far, except when \u2018cut\u2019 following several shots. They went into the fairway at Chicago GC and Jim and Dave began hitting the newly designed rubber-covered golf ball [the Haskell]. \u2018Jimmy and I played one of the first dozen ever turned out\u2019, Dave would recall years later \u2018and even Jim couldn\u2019t keep them from ducking to the ground just off the tee. We quit after a little while and rode our bicycles back to Wheaton. We remolded the balls, marking them the same as we used to mark the solid gutta-percha ones. That fixed them; Jimmy made \u2019em go after that. The trouble was that the covers were too smooth; they wouldn\u2019t grip the air.\u2019 In an interesting addition to this story, Coburn Haskell, the inventor of the rubber-coated ball, heard what the Foulis had done to his ball, and threatened to sue them. What the brothers were doing was buying his ball, marking them to make them fly better and then reselling them. Haskell eventually did nothing, but he did buy one of their molds to mark his balls as well!\n\nThe new Foulis brothers bramble-pattern balls, named appropriately the American Eagle, was made and sold by them for years, though it has been reported that they likely gave away as many balls as they sold.\n\nWith the new ball flight, the brothers saw the need for a new club, one that fell between a mashie (5-iron) and the niblick (9-iron). \u2018That brought up the need for a new club, for the old ones wouldn\u2019t hold a middle distance pitch shot on the green with the new and faster ball. I took a niblick and remade it, and the result was the mashie-niblick!\u2019 [Today a 7-iron]. Dave built it and Jim tested it. Together they applied-for and received a patent on the new club. They held the patent on the club until 1920, and received royalties on each club sold.\n\nAfter leaving Chicago GC around 1916, Dave ran their highly successful J&D Foulis Company until 1921. At that time he moved to Hinsdale GC in Chicago and rebuilt it from a mediocre course to one of the finest in the Midwest. He remained there as pro-greens keeper for 18 seasons before retiring at the end of the 1939 season.\n\nBesides their work with early balls and clubs, it has been said that they were very innovative. Can you give us an example of their innovation?\n\nThe brothers continued to be very innovative in other areas as well. One of the things we take for granted is the liner inside the hole. Early on, the holes were just excavated by the greens keeper and were not changed daily. The size of the hole would vary as player after player holed out. Dave made the following observation in a 1905 article in Golf Illustrated, \u2018After a few days the hole would get deeper and deeper, as caddies would scoop sand from the bottom of the cup to make tees at the next teeing ground!\u2019 While the liner is said to have first appeared in Scotland in the 1870\u2019s, Dave Foulis brought the concept to America and sold the first metal liners around 1902!\n\nAnother of their innovations was the \u2018Foulis Flag\u2019 which took advantage of the new metal liner inside the cup to hold the flag in a \u2018perfectly upright position\u2019. The Foulis brother\u2019s ad for this item was included in the Olympic Program in 1904.\n\n10. Please shed some light on their instrumental involvement in the early formation of the PGA of America.\n\nRobert White, who would become the first President of the PGA in 1916, was the head professional at Ravisloe from 1902 through 1914. The Illinois Pro\u2019s had elected him president of their association. Years before professionals in New York or Boston pros organized, the Illinois association had their members playing in events and paying $2 per year in dues, along with $5 for each event. Then in 1915, White moved to Pennsylvania and the following year to Wykagyl as pro-greens keeper. While at Wykagyl, Rodman Wanamaker held the luncheon where the PGA was formed. White\u2019s friendship with the Chicago golfers, and his reputation among the New York crowd, were enough to have him elected president, a position he held until 1920. As the PGA of America was being formed in New York, the Foulis brothers came together to get local professionals to support the new organization, and their friend White, as they helped form the first local \u2018section\u2019 as the Illinois PGA was founded. Dave Foulis served as president of the Illinois PGA for at least one term, and his obituary in 1950 stated that he and his brothers were instrumental in the founding of the PGA of America.\n\nWhat about their involvement in the Society of Golf Course Architects in 1948 (ASGCA)?\n\nThe Golf Course Architects Society was formed in 1947, two years after the death of Robert. There would have been little doubt that he would have been a Charter Member had he not passed away in 1945.\n\nJim Foulis, as noted earlier, had been a friend of Jack Daray Sr., one of the original founders of the ASGCA. Daray, like many local Chicago pros, was part of the original group that met at courses such as Ridge, Ravisloe and others, where they discussed course design, greens keeping and other aspects of golf course work.\n\nAmong the other original members of the ASGCA, the following had relationships with the Foulis\u2019: Robert Bruce Harris, the first president, had worked with Robert at University GC in St. Louis in 1930. Their relationship with Donald Ross was noted earlier. Another founder, William Diddel, designed Crystal Lake GC in St. Louis in 1929 and remodeled Midland Valley in 1928 (forerunner to Meadowbrook CC, which, by coincidence, when the club moved in 1960 was designed by Robert Bruce Harris). Lastly, William Langford did work at Ruth Lake CC in 1926, where Jim Foulis was head pro, and at St. Clair CC (St. Louis area) in 1927, when Robert was at Bellerive.\n\nIn general, what are the architectural merits of their courses?\n\nTypical of the day, their courses featured the traditional style of that era; namely medium to small greens, teeing areas quite close to previous greens, bunkers that fell into two categories, greenside bunkers with flat bottoms and cross-bunkers featuring tall mounding facing the player and sand on the opposite side. Glen Echo had several of these features on the original layout of the course.\n\nAccording to Keith Foster, who spent several years forming his business in the St. Louis community, the Foulis\u2019 had several very unique, yet classical design characteristics. First among these were their placement of the teeing grounds and greens. With the greens in place, it appeared to Foster that the positioning of the tee-pads followed a hill-to-hill manner. At Glen Echo and Normandie, two of their early designs, many tee shots on 4-pars and 5-pars, carry valley\u2019s to a landing area and then a carry to the green. This is also especially noticeable on their many outstanding par-3\u2019s where you have an elevated tee to an elevated green. Many of these holes maintain the original design of a century ago and remain a timeless vision of their early golfing designs.\n\nAnother characteristic was how they tended to \u2018cut\u2019 their bunkers off prominent features around the course. If a green was situated on a plateau, for example, they would have cut-in a bunker underneath the plateau. This was similar to work done by Walter Travis on his designs.\n\nTheir bunkering was also more of a \u2018splash out\u2019 style as opposed to those with high deep faces. Foulis\u2019 bunkers were not as penal, yet provided the degree of difficulty sought for errant shots. Lake Geneva CC, Robert\u2019s 1897 design, has been virtually untouched through the years, with this bunkering style prominent on most of their holes.\n\nAnother characteristic, most often found when thinking of Donald Ross courses, is the slope of the greens and the \u2018crown\u2019 effect. The Foulis\u2019 employed these on their courses, along with the occasional tiered-green. Many of the holes at Glen Echo, Normandie and Lake Geneva have sharp back-to-front or side-to-side slopes.\n\nHowever, what was also unique about the Foulis brothers design was their use of features that are often attributed to other, more well-known architects. In 1901, James and Robert positioned cross bunkers on several holes at Glen Echo. These remained in play for years until removed in the \u2018modernization\u2019 trend of the 1950\u2019s. Designers such as Colt and Allison, Raynor, Mackenzie and Tillinghast all employed this technique on many of their great designs at Shoreacres, Cypress Point and Baltimore Five Farms. This crossing-hazard on a number of their terrific short par-4\u2019s would be scorned by many today, but was considered an outstanding design feature when constructed and remains so on courses bold enough to maintain them today.\n\nGlen Echo was not Robert\u2019s first design but it was his first 18-hole layout. What are some of the unique characteristics of the course?\n\nGlen Echo was founded by men with a passion for golf and the wealth to support it. Contracting with the Foulis\u2019 was not surprising. James was well known in the area from his previous designs and having Robert join him was an unexpected bonus.\n\nGlen Echo was the first St. Louis area course designed from its beginning with 18-holes. Before this, each course only had 9-holes, though many were contemplating adding their second nine to satisfy their members (no public courses existed in the St. Louis area until 1912). Foulis took the existing terrain, which featured several lakes, ravines, steep hills and rolling grounds and constructed what was called at the time \u2018the finest links in America\u2019, though as we all know that moniker was used to describe virtually every new course constructed for years, mostly to satisfy the young membership that they had made a good investment in their course!\n\nFifteen of the existing holes maintain virtually the same routing as it did a century ago. Through the years, the course has been lengthened from just over 6,100 yards to 6,500 with the addition of new tee boxes. The newest holes \u2013 the first and eighteenth \u2013 were added in 1927 when a new clubhouse was built that required a change in the original routing, and the sixth hole was added in 1914 when the original third and fourth were combined into one new hole.\n\nMany of the greens require an uphill approach, some more severe than others. The first and third holes feature a severe uphill approach to a sharply sloping back-to-front green. The second, which has remained unchanged since opening day, features a slightly elevated tee to a left to right sloping fairway. Finding the fairway, you are left with an uphill approach to a medium size, fairly level green. The number three handicap hole, at 432 yards it is a well-deserved par. During the 1904 Olympic matches, many competitors found this hole the most difficult on the course.\n\nMost of the par-3\u2019s feature downhill approaches to the green, seemingly making the shot somewhat easier. However, even the 136-yard 14th, modeled after the short hole 8th at St. Andrews, requires an accurate shot to avoid the bunkering right and front left, or the steep falloff to the left. The twelfth, a par-4 of 406 yards, is another example of great design. An elevated tee to a hilltop 230-250 yards away with a grove of trees to the left. A good tee shot will leave you in the fairway atop the hill, about 150-180 yards out, facing a slightly downhill lie to the sharply uphill green; a very demanding shot. Bold hitters attempt to draw around the trees, or fly over them, hoping to land at the bottom of the hill in the only flat area on the hole. From there, it is but a hundred yards or so to the green. However, a false front fools many players, especially when the ball rolls back down the hill 30-40 feet, wishing they had taken one more club.\n\nBut perhaps the seventh best typifies the demanding shots required to mark a four on your card. At 468 yards, your tee shot must carry 260 yards over a valley to the elevated fairway, leaving you an approach of about 200 yards, once again all carry, to a green with three well-positioned bunkers. A false-front awaits the short approach, while shots coming in a bit too sharply will hit the green and roll through, leaving a very difficult pitch from thick rough to a green sloping away from you.\n\nNormandie Golf Club was built shortly following Glen Echo. Are there similarities between the courses?\n\nThe yardages are nearly identical, both just over 6,500 yards today (and both at just over 6,000 when opened) and both play to a par 71. A private course from 1901 to 1985, Normandie has been an outstanding public facility for the past 18 seasons. Known as a player\u2019s course, most of the areas top amateurs joined Normandie for the competition and challenges.\n\nLike Glen Echo, Normandie was designed on rolling hills, which allowed the Foulis\u2019 to create their tee to green \u2018pad\u2019 holes. Holes that typify this are the opening par-4, (at 446 yards and the number one handicap hole) the seventh, eighth and ninth on the front, and the tenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and eighteenth. The par-4 tenth, at 420 yards, features a demanding uphill tee shot, and once there a downhill approach to a green with a creek in front. Par 3\u2019s of 220-240 yards, par 4\u2019s with approaches which must carry open valleys, and shorter par-3\u2019s with steep slopes and tiered greens. Both courses also feature short, strategic par-4\u2019s that tempt you to go for the green, risking the sand or rough nearby, while rewarding the successful attempt.\n\nNormandie was the site of the first Missouri Amateur in 1905, making it the 6th oldest state amateur in the country, and site of the 1908 Western Open, won by Willie Anderson. It was also over these links that Jess Sweetser began to play the game as a youngster before his parents moved to the east coast shortly after the outbreak of World War I and the family changed their very-German name to Sweetser.\n\nRobert also designed the original Bellerive layout. How was it received in the area following his other two designs?\n\nApart from St. Louis CC, which remains the area\u2019s premier course for most players, when Bellerive was built in 1910, as a collaborative effort between Jim, Robert, and Dave Foulis, it was hailed as the best course in the area. The course was longer than most courses of the day, at over 6,500 yards, and was built on over 350 acres. Bellerive was located less than a mile from both Glen Echo and Normandie, so the ground and other characteristics were similar.\n\nAs the years moved along, the growth of the airline industry had a dramatic impact on Bellerive. Located less than 5 miles from St. Louis\u2019 Lambert Field, the airplane landing path was located almost directly over portions of the course. In 1955, a military jet crashed on the 15th fairway, killing the pilot and causing the Bellerive Board to begin to investigate a move to a new location, further west in St. Louis County. The club moved to its present site in 1960, when Robert Trent Jones selected the land for the club and built the existing layout. The University of Missouri purchased the land from the club for their new St. Louis campus, and for several years, through the 1960\u2019s, used the clubhouse as their administration offices. Today, the University of Missouri \u2013 St. Louis (UMSL), occupies all of the former land.\n\nYou mention Lake Geneva CC. Not many players have been to that course. How does it reflect the Foulis\u2019 style?\n\nLake Geneva was originally a resort course for wealthy Chicagoans during the summer months. It has not changed that much through the years. At first appearance, it does not seem all that demanding. There are rolling hills, but they do not seem too severe. However, you will soon find out that looks can be deceiving. Sitting aside Lake Geneva, the land is generally fairly level. However, in keeping with the Foulis style, they used the land to create their \u2018pad\u2019 effect on several holes, while others have severe sloping fairways and greens that provide the \u2018teeth\u2019 for the hole.\n\nThe par-4 sixth is one such hole. At 396 yards, your tee shot is from an elevated tee to a slight dogleg right fairway. A good shot leaves you well inside 160 yards, but that\u2019s when the real challenge begins. Your approach, usually from a slightly downhill lie, must cross a road, 50 yards short of the green, then a creek just on the other side of the road, to a green that slopes severely from back right to front left. Holding the ball to the right is almost impossible without hitting a high fade, and still gravity will take the ball to the left.\n\nThe par-3 ninth is another terrific hole. From an elevated tee, your shot must carry to the green, which slopes severely back to front, that is guarded left and right by Foulis-style splash bunkers. At 177 yards, the wind off the lake to your right affects many shots, forcing an extra club or two at times. Another par-3, the fifth, uses a bunker at front right and the slope of the green, left to right, to protect the hole and make earning par well deserved.\n\nEven on this gently rolling terrain, Robert took advantage of each rise in the land to position tee or green to make the hole more interesting and the shotmaking just a bit more demanding.\n\nAnother of their courses was Denver CC. Has this remained true to the Foulis\u2019 design?\n\nUnfortunately not. Denver CC, built in 1902, has undergone major renovations through the years by some of the great architects of the day. Some of those who remodeled Denver CC include; Harry Collis, William Flynn, William Diddel, Press Maxwell, Ed Seay and Bill Coore. It is interesting to note that Collis, who did the first redesign, was originally the greens keeper at Flossmoor in 1906, where he undoubtedly would have known the Foulis\u2019 at Chicago GC. His redesign of Denver was done in the days just prior to World War I.\n\nWhat about their home life and their families?\n\nJames Foulis Sr. was married to Helen Foulis. He was born in 1841 and died in 1925. Helen was born in 1847 and she passed away in 1928, just a month before her son Jim Jr. In addition to their sons, they had two daughters, Annie, who was born in 1876 and died in 1963 and little Maggie who died in 1885 at age 4.\n\nRobert had two children, Ronald and Eleanora. Ronald (1904) went on to become a successful lawyer, while Eleanora (1905) married Clarence Miller and they had two children, Laird and Robert Miller. When Robert Foulis settled at Bellerive in 1910, he stayed there for the next 32 years, living on Wheaton Avenue, just blocks from the front door of Normandie GC and within just a mile or so from Glen Echo and Bellerive. He remained pro-emeritus following his retirement in 1942. Robert died while on vacation in Florida on March 6, 1945 at the age of 71. His wife, Amanda, passed away in 1977. In 1995, Eleanora Foulis Miller passed away in Colorado. Her granddaughter, Malinda, found boxes in her attic that had been stored for years. In one of these boxes was glass jars filled with grass seed that Robert had brought from Scotland while looking for the perfect mixture to use on his courses. Ronald passed away in 1996 while living in California. Ronald had two children Ronald and Saralee, both of which reside in Pennsylvania.\n\nDave, born in 1868, had a son Jim, who was also a golf professional and who won the Illinois PGA championship several times. He was also a competitor in the first Masters in 1934 and competed in most of the PGA\u2019s and U.S. Open\u2019s through 1940. Dave died at age 82 in 1950. Dave had two children, daughter Jessie and son Jim. Named for his uncle and grandfather, Jim Foulis, Dave\u2019s son, had a son, Dave Sr., who today lives in Massachusetts and a grandson, also named Dave, who also resides in Massachusetts. Dave Sr. has a brother Jim, who resides in Florida.\n\nJim Foulis Jr. was married to Jeanie Foulis but the union did not produce any offspring. He died of kidney failure on March 3, 1928 at the age of 57. Jeanie survived until 1960 at the age of 83.\n\nSimpson was born in 1884 and died in 1951. His wife Alice was born in 1887 and she passed away in 1973. They had two daughters, Roberta and Margery. Margery passed away in 1956, while Roberta resides in Lafayette, Indiana today with her husband Don Stoike.\n\nJohn Foulis, the eldest son, died in 1907 at the age of 42. There is no record that he married.\n\nHow should the Foulis\u2019 be remembered?\n\nRobert, Jim and Dave learned their golf and their design from the master himself at St. Andrews. His love of the natural style of golf deeply influenced them and in the days without mechanical earth-moving equipment, they were forced to select the correct piece of land and position the holes on it for the most enjoyment possible. This was the era when golf was more sport than entertainment. The challenges lay in the bunkering, greens, hills, and lakes that dotted the landscape, keeping in mind the prevailing winds impact on each shot as well. At the same time, they provided generous fairways for their landing areas. Through the years many clubs have planted trees that were never meant to infringe on their original designs (or those of many other architects of this era). As a result, the open designs they created have been reverse-designed as players must maneuver around large trees instead of fairway bunkers or the more penal cross-bunkers.\n\nHowever, the Foulis\u2019 would best be remembered for bringing to the Midwest their love of the game. From the heart and mind of Old Tom they brought to their courses in Missouri, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado, the shot values, features and memories of the best of golf from Scotland. They did it with class, an attention to detail, and a spirit that made them among the most respected and admired men of their day. While many of their closest friends are among the ranks of the great designers \u2013 Macdonald, Ross, Park and Bendelow \u2013 it would be safe to say that these brothers found solace and satisfaction in staying near the courses they created, while giving back to the members at those clubs, their knowledge and love of the game."}, {"url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/television/fire-countrys-billy-burke-on-working-with-tv-son-max-thieriot-and-why-he-thinks-the-cbs-drama-is-already-a-hit", "page_content": "We are only a few weeks into the fall 2022 TV premieres , and yet there already seems to be at least one definitive winner: Fire Country. The CBS drama from creator/star Max Thieriot that follows a group of convicts who join a firefighting program in Northern California to reduce their sentences was such a hit right out of the gate that it was given a full season order after only two of its episodes had aired. Thieriot is doing double duty on his new series while sticking around on SEAL Team, and now his co-star, Billy Burke, has opened up about working with him and why he thinks the show is already so popular.\n\nWhat Did Fire Country\u2019s Billy Burke Say About Working With Max Thieriot?\n\nViewers who\u2019ve already enjoyed what the freshman fire-fighting drama has to offer know that the relationship between Burke\u2019s Vince and Thieriot\u2019s Bode is a very strained one, meaning that many of their on-screen interactions land somewhere between awkward, at best, and tense at their worst. Thankfully, the Twilight actor recently told TV Line that things are much easier between him and his TV son:\n\nOh my god, I love that kid. Yeah, we\u2019re having a great time. I mean, he\u2019s just a dear man and he really cares about this story and all its components. He\u2019s just so invested in it, and it bleeds out into everything he does and everything we do on set. We couldn\u2019t have asked for a better guy to come and work with.\n\nAs noted earlier, the star had already been a major part of SEAL Team for several seasons when he came up with the idea for the new series. It\u2019s based on his time actually growing up in Northern California\u2019s fire country and a real firefighting program was used for inspiration , so it makes a lot of sense that all of his work on the Friday night hit would be infused with his passion for the story .\n\nWhat Did Billy Burke Say About Fire Country's Success?\n\nSpeaking of the show\u2019s success, it\u2019s becoming more and more rare for network series to break out the way this fire-fighting family drama has, with the first two episodes pulling in 8.3 million viewers and making it the most watched, top rated show. And, Burke, who\u2019s played major parts in series like Revolution, Zoo, and The Closer, thinks he knows why people are loving his new drama:\n\nI don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s a \u201cno brainer,\u201d because there are no \u201cno brainers\u201d when it comes to TV anymore, as we all know. But it is one of those shows that\u2019s got all the elements of what people watch TV dramas for. And that is relationships, family, involvement in whatever that family does\u2026.

He's most famous because he played in, and won, the longest playoff in major championship history: 72 playoff holes.\n\nFull name: William John Burke (birth name Burkowski)\n\nDate of birth: December 14, 1902\n\nPlace of birth: Naugatuck, Connecticut\n\nDate and place of death: April 19, 1972 in Clearwater, Florida\n\nBurke's PGA Tour Wins\n\n1927 Florida Open\n\n1927 Central Florida Open\n\n1928 North and South Open\n\n1929 New York State Open\n\n1929 Glens Falls Open\n\n1930 Mid South Open\n\n1931 U.S. Open\n\n1931 Glens Falls Open\n\n1932 Florida West Coast Open\n\n1935 The Cascades Open\n\n1936 Centennial Open\n\n1939 Walter Hagen 25th Anniversary*\n\n1940 Miami Biltmore International Four-Ball*\n\nBurke is credited with wins in 13 tournaments that are now counted by the PGA Tour as official tour wins:*These two were two-man team tournaments. At the 1939 Hagen, Burke partnered with Ed Dudley . At the 1940 Miami International, his partner was Craig Wood\n\nIn the Majors\n\nHis victory in the 1931 U.S. Open (more on that to come) was Burke's lone win in a major championship. And he never played in the British Open. His best other finishes were third places in the 1934 Masters and in the 1939 Masters ; plus he reached the semifinals in the 1931 PGA Championship\n\nOverall, Burke had six Top 10s in majors. The first major he played in was the 1928 U.S. Open, and he last played in a major in the 1961 Masters.\n\nHis Epic 1931 U.S. Win\n\nNot only did Burke win the 1931 U.S. Open , he won it playing with steel-shafted golf clubs. He was the first golfer to win the U.S. Open with steel shafts.\n\nOh, and then there was that 72-hole playoff. This Open was played at Inverness in Ohio, scheduled to end on July 4. The weather was brutal with temperatures in the 90s, some days approaching 100 \u2014 the 1931 U.S. Open is sometimes remembered as \"the Inferno at Inverness.\"\n\nBurke opened with a 73, two off the lead. In the second round, he shot 72 and moved to within one of leader George Von Elm. Von Elm was the tour's leading money winner heading into this tournament.\n\nOn the third day they played 36 holes, the third and fourth rounds. Von Elm's lead over second-place Burke was two following the third round. But Burke took the lead in Round 4, until Von Elm made a 10-foot putt to tie him on the 72nd hole.\n\nFor the first time, the USGA used a 36-hole playoff to decide its Open champion. The only problem was that Burke and Von Elm ended the 36-hole playoff day tied again, and again after Von Elm made a 10-footer on the final hole to tie. They both carded 149s.\n\nSo the next day, they came back and did it all again, their third consecutive day playing 36 holes. And this 36 holes was just like the previous two: tight throughtout. In fact, Burke and Von Elm traded the lead 25 times over the final 36.\n\nIn the end, after 72 holes of regular play and 72 more playoff holes, Burke won by a single stroke. He won the second playoff 148 to 149.\n\nThe USGA reacted to this epic battle \u2014 one literally hotly contested in July \u2014 two ways: It moved the U.S. Open from July back to June to try to reduce the heat; and it eliminated 36-hole playoffs, going back to 18-hole playoffs.\n\nMore About Billy Burke\n\nBurke was the son of Polish immigrants to American from Lithuania (the family name was Burkauskas, which was polonized to Burkowski, then anglicized to Burke). Billy began playing golf at age 12 after first starting caddying.\n\nAs a teenager, Burke went to work in the same iron foundry in which his father worked. But an accident there took off Burke's ring finger on his left hand, plus part of his left pinkie. After that, he had to rebuild his golf grip to work for him despite those missing fingers.\n\nIt didn't much slow Burke's progress as a golfer. After a hard day in the foundry, Burke headed to the driving range to practice. In Connecticut golf circles, they started calling him \"the Boy Marvel\" for his golf prowess.\n\nWhen he was 18, Burke first entered the Connecticut State Amateur. The only problem was he didn't own the clothes (such as plus-fours) to meet the dress standard for that big event. His dilemma received local media attention, and two local golfers Burke caddied for stepped up to outfit him with new golf clothes and pay his fare to the tournament.\n\nIn 1923, when he was 20, Burke made it to the championship match of the Connecticut State Amateur before losing to Henry Topping. But it turned out to be a great loss for Burke: Topping was a millionaire businessman who became an ongoing benefactor for Burke's golf career, including staking him when he shortly turned pro to try the PGA Tour.\n\nBurke began winning pro tour events in the late 1920s (the 1927 Florida Open is credited as his first tour win). His final tour win was in 1940.\n\nBurke also won other tournaments that are not counted as PGA Tour events, including the Ohio Open four times: 1938, 1939, 1945 and lastly in 1955 at the age of 52.\n\nThe year of 1931 was one of three in which he won twice on tour (1927 and 1929 being the other two), but it was without question his best year. It included his only major championship win at the U.S. Open, plus he reached the semifinals in the PGA Championship. Burke made the first of two appearances on Team USA in the Ryder Cup that year, winning both matches he played. (He also played in the 1933 Ryder Cup.)\n\nAnd Burke got married that year to Marguerite, who survived him when he died at age 69 in 1972.\n\nLater in 1931, Burke and George Von Elm, off the hoopla surrounding their 72-hole playoff, went on an exhibition tour together.\n\nAlong the way, Burke also worked as a club pro and was noted as a golf instructor. He was pro for 29 years, beginning in 1934, at Cleveland (Ohio) Country Club. From 1946-62, he was the winter-season pro at Clearwater (Fla.) Country Club. Burke also taught at the 9-hole course in his hometown of Naugatuck, Conn., as well as in Dark Harbor, Maine. In addition, Burke had endorsement deals with sports equipment companies and Billy Burke-branded golf clubs and golf balls were both produced during his heyday.\n\nBurke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966."}, {"url": "https://www.usga.org/history/great-moments--1965-u-s--open.html", "page_content": "Gary Player walked up the 71st fairway in the 1962 U.S. Open lamenting a lost opportunity. He had put himself in position to win the championship, but a final round of missed chances left him five strokes out of a playoff with Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer. Player confided in the referee walking with his group, \u201cI\u2019m so disappointed not to win the U.S. Open. Had I won, I had planned to give the prize money to charities. But let\u2019s keep that a secret. One day I shall win and I\u2019ll turn back the prize money to good causes.\u201d\n\nThree years later, he was in a position to do exactly that. Player defeated Australia\u2019s Kel Nagle, 71 to 74, in an 18-hole playoff at Bellerive Country Club in St. Louis to win the 1965 U.S. Open. During Sunday\u2019s final round, Player nearly gave away the championship by squandering a three-stroke lead. After Monday\u2019s playoff win, however, Player gave away everything but the title, donating all his winnings to charity, saying, \u201cI am a foreigner here. The American people have treated me so well I wanted to give something back.\u201d\n\nAmerican-born golfers had dominated the U.S. Open through the middle decades of the 20th century. Homebred players won every U.S. Open between 1928 and 1964 \u2013 a length of time that spanned nearly two generations. With players such as Palmer, Nicklaus and Billy Casper dominating the game\u2019s landscape in the early 1960s, it seemed a foregone conclusion that an American would once again claim the title in 1965.\n\nWhile Palmer and Nicklaus battled for national championships, money titles and America\u2019s affections in the 1960s, South Africa\u2019s Gary Player took the international game by storm. It has been said that no one in history logged more miles playing golf than Player, who traveled more than 15 million miles while winning titles on six continents.\n\nPlayer was born in Johannesburg, the youngest of three children. His mother died of cancer when he was just eight and his father was often away from home, working in the gold mines. He compensated for his slight build (5-foot-7 and 150 pounds) with a strict diet and fitness regimen that complemented his natural athleticism and grace. He turned professional at age 17 and in 1959 won the British Open as a 23-year-old, becoming the youngest champion to that point in history. Player went on to win the 1961 Masters and 1962 PGA Championship, along with dozens of other tournaments across the globe in the early 1960s. He came into the 1965 U.S. Open as one of the game\u2019s leading players.\n\nFrom Elvis' moves to touchdown dances, @garyplayer shares the lighter side of the Black Knight. https://t.co/lFazll4uTc \u2014 U.S. Open (USGA) (@usopengolf) June 19, 2015\n\nBreaking from the custom of holding U.S. Opens at historic venues, the USGA awarded the 1965 championship to a course that was just five years old. Built on rolling Missouri farmland just west of St. Louis, Bellerive was designed by Robert Trent Jones Sr. and featured unusually large and subtly contoured greens. At 7,191 yards, it also established a record as the longest course to host the championship.\n\nFor the first time in history, the U.S. Open was played over four days. This new format not only provided increased television revenue and exposure, but it also solved the challenge of having the 60-plus players who had made the cut complete 36 holes on Saturday.\n\nDespite Bellerive\u2019s length, long hitters seemed to gain little advantage in the opening round. In fact, Nagle and Deane Beman, two of the shortest hitters in the field, were two of just three competitors to break par on Thursday. Nagle, who shot 68, played fairway woods into four of the par 4s and claimed he would have had a fifth if he had not hit his drive into the rough and been forced to lay up. Beman, the game\u2019s leading amateur, used 13 fairway woods for his approach shots but still managed a 1-under 69. Player shot a 70, telling the media after the round that he couldn\u2019t \u201cremember ever making finer contact with the ball.\u201d Three missed putts from inside 8 feet cost him what could have been a spectacular round.\n\nPlayer matched his score in the second round to take a one-stroke lead over Nagle and Mason Rudolph. Beman, with rounds of 69-73 for 142, was alone in fourth. Player made one birdie (an 18-footer at the ninth), one bogey and 16 pars in a consistent, if unspectacular, round. The biggest story on day two, however, was the big names that were absent from the leader board. Palmer \u2013 who had a victory, two runner-up finishes and a tie for fifth in his previous five U.S. Opens \u2013 shot 76-76 for 152 and missed the cut. Likewise, the defending champion, Ken Venturi, was going home after rounds of 81-79. Nicklaus rebounded from an opening 78 with a 72 to make the cut on the number, but thereafter was never in contention. He got up and down just once in 13 attempts on Thursday and Friday. For the first time in seven years, Palmer and Nicklaus would both finish outside the top five at the U.S. Open."}, {"url": "http://www.polishsportshof.com/portfolio_page/billy-burkowski-burke/", "page_content": "Description\n\nInducted June 9, 2005\n\nBorn William Burkowski in Union City, Connecticut, Burke played on the PGA Tour with great success. His first tour victory came in his second year on tour winning the prestigious North-South Open in 1928. Playing with a slightly unorthodox grip because of the loss of parts of two fingers on his left hand, Burke made golfing record books when he won the 1931 U.S. Open at Inverness in Toledo. He was the first person to win a major playing steel-shafted clubs and he did it by outdueling George Von Elm in a 72-hole playoff. It was the longest playoff ever played. He won 10 times on the tour and twice finished third in the Masters. Burke was also considered one of the finest Ryder Cup team members of his era being undefeated in Ryder Cup play in 1931 and 1933. He was inducted in the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966.\n\nINDUCTION BANQUET PROGRAM STORY \u2014 June 9, 2005\n\nU.S. Open and Ryder Cup Champion\n\nBy: Tom Tarapacki\n\nNPASHF Board Member\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century there were increasing numbers of Polish immigrants in America, but not many were playing significant roles in sports. The reason for that was mainly twofold: in large part they were unfamiliar with American sports, and were too busy working to find time to play. When their children did start to play sports in large numbers in the 1920s and 1930s, they tended to gravitate to \u201cworking class\u201d sports like baseball and football. It was therefore quite surprising when, in the 1930s, the son of Polish immigrants known as Bill Burke became one of the most prominent names in the sport of golf.\n\nIn 1931 Burke \u2014 born William Burkowski in Union City Connecticut \u2014 became the first person to win a major playing with steel-shafted clubs when he won the U.S. Open. He did it by out dueling George Von Elm in the longest playoff ever played.\n\nFor many years, American golf was largely considered the domain of the wealthy, a \u201ccountry club sport\u201d like tennis or polo. It was unusual for the son of a Polish-born foundry worker to even take up the sport, much less excel at it. The story goes that 15-year-old Burkowski was with playing some friends when the caddie master at the Naugatuck Golf Club, desperate for caddies, recruited him to carry clubs for golfers. He eventually started playing the game himself. He couldn\u2019t afford clubs or a bag, so some members gave him clubs and he carried them in his hands. He kept playing despite losing the ring finger and severely injuring the little finger on his left hand while working in a local foundry. At age 16 \u201cThe Boy Marvel\u201d won the Naugatuck club championship in a driving rainstorm. Supporters bought him a golf bag so he could play in the state amateur, which he lost on the final hole. They following year, 1923, he went on to win the state amateur. That victory led to Burkowski, who anglicized his name to Burke, getting a job as a golf pro at the Mattatuck Golf Course in Waterbury.\n\nIn 1931 Burke went to the U.S. Open at the Inverness Club in Toledo. He trailed the leader, George Von Elm of California, by two strokes at the start of the 36-hole final round on Sunday, July 4th. At the end of regular play, Burke and Von Elm were tied. On Monday following day they played a 36-hole playoff to decide the title, and ended the day still tied. On Tuesday they launched another 36-hole playoff, but this time Burke ended up winning by a single stroke. After 144 holes and 589 stokes, Billy Burke was the U.S. Open champion. Burke\u2019s victory was particularly significant not only because he used steel-shafted clubs, but also because the lengthy playoff caused a change in all future playoff formats.\n\nAlthough the Open win was the high point, Burke enjoyed a fine career. He won 10 career tournaments, and finished third at the Masters twice. Burke played in 159 career PGA Tour tournaments and finished in the top 10 an amazing 80 times. He was also considered one of the finest Ryder Cup team members of his era going undefeated in the 1931 and 1933 Ryder Cups. Burke was inducted into the PGA Hall of Fame in 1966 and died in Florida in 1972.\n\nBilly Burke was a true pioneer, excelling in the sport of golf years before other outstanding Polish-American golfers like Ed Furgol and Bob Toski appeared on the scene."}]}
