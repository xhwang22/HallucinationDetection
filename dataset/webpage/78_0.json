But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk. A new school, the Yeoman School, was built next door. Opened in 1846 this was intended to cater for the 'middle class children' of agriculturalists, as well as to provide teaching practice for student teachers at St John's.\n\nThe new school ran into financial difficulties, however, and in 1858, after 300 years in Ogleforth, Archbishop Holgate's School took it over.\n\nThe iron gates to the school's playing fields seem to have been designed between 1850 and 1860 by George Townsend Andrews, the architect who had designed St John's College itself. They were made by the Walmgate-based Walker Iron Foundry, which also made railings and gates for the British Museum, as well as others across York, including in St Leonard's Place, York Cemetery, Dean's Park and at St Peter's School.\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School thrived in its new location in Lord Mayor's Walk. By 1915, when the Rev William Johnson retired as headmaster, the school had 294 pupils.\n\nBy then, the school had leased part of Bootham Stray for playing fields, which is why the school playing field gates - which were restored in 2017 by York Civic Trust working with York Hospital - are there to this day.\n\nThe school itself moved to its present site on Hull Road in 1963.\n\nStephen Lewis\n\nFor the stories behind more York Civic Trust plaques, visit yorkcivictrust.co.uk"}, {"url": "https://maltonians.maltonschool.org/people/holgate.php", "page_content": "Illustrated here is the church at Darrington, near Pontefract.

In his Will he asked that his body should \"be buried in the parish church within the parish whereof it shall please Almighty God to take me out of this transitory life\".

The venue was appropriate since the gathering followed up on a tradition whereby Old Boy Fellows of Oxford and: Cambridge colleges offered hospitality and help to members of the School during their undergraduate days ( Frank Woodward was himself a Mathematical Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge ).\n\nThe decision of that February meeting was \"to form a London Association of Old Boys of Archbishop Holgate's School affiliated to the Association in York\" with the principal aims of \"facilitating re-union gatherings and social intercourse for its members\"; also \"to help all boys, past and present, of the school\" and \" to take steps, wherever possible, to enhance the reputation of the ancient school and to foster its traditions\".\n\nColonel E A Loftus (school 1897 -1903) was elected Chairman; Frank Woodward was Honorary Treasurer and Harry Ward ( 1904 -1914) became Honorary Secretary.\n\nReunion Dinners.\n\nThe first reunion dinner was held at the Waldorf Hotel, Aldwych, WC2 on 14 May 1947. The cost was 16 shillings (80p); this was quite expensive when one considers that, during the war, the charge for any meal was limited to 5 shillings (25p). It was agreed to charge a membership fee, per annum, of one guinea (\u00a3 1.05) for those aged 25 and over, with a reduced fee of half a guinea (52.5p) for those under 25. It has pointed out that Old Boys could become Life Members of the York Association at a cost of \u00a34; this sum included receipt of \"The Mitre\" free of charge for the rest of one's life!\n\nFrom the earliest times, much emphasis was given to the third of the above objectives (\"taking steps, wherever possible, to enhance the reputation of the school ...\"). This applied particularly to gathering information relating to our Founder - a seemingly endless task, which I enjoy doing to this day.\n\nBy the Autumn of 1947, Sir Gerald Woolston, Norroy and Ulster King of Arms and formerly Garter Principal King of Arms, had prepared, at the request of the Society, a sketch of the Archbishop's armorial bearings. A replica in oak was prepared and presented by the President to the Society.\n\nThe other objectives were forwarded by arranging to complete a list of Old Boys willing to offer hospitality to boys \"newly coming to London\" and to forward the list to the Headmaster. The Society decided upon affiliation with the Society of Yorkshiremen in London, especially because so many Old Boys were the recipients of Scholarships founded by that Society.\n\nA pattern of two reunion dinners per year (spring and autumn) was agreed upon; most of these were held at Brown's Hotel, Dover Street (at least until 1963). Accompanying each dinner was a beautifully-produced menu card, the work of Frank Woodward (by now our Honorary Archivist). Collectively they comprise valuable historical material relating back to the early days of the school and to its Founder. The considerable effort involved was finally well-rewarded, since they formed a significant part of the material available to E N Jewels when he agreed to prepare a \"History of Archbishop Holgate's Grammar School, York\" published as a book in 1962 (and thus beyond the scope of my remit).\n\nThe pattern of two dinners per year was unexpectedly interrupted almost as soon as it began. We had planned our most important reunion so far, with significant progress to report, and with the Archbishop of York as our chief guest and speaker. The meeting was to be held at Brown's Hotel as usual, on 26 November 1948. At the last minute, the Archbishop's secretary discovered that the Archbishop Holgate Society held its meetings in London and not in York - so the Archbishop had to withdraw and the meeting was cancelled! Since that time I do not think that we have ever had the pleasure of receiving an Archbishop (as Chairman of Governors) at a London meeting ( I hope to hear that this was not the case). This was the only time a reunion was cancelled in the early years - and we made up for it by holding three meetings in 1949.\n\nThe reunion held on 12 January 1949 was the first occasion on which a committee meeting was held on the same evening and at the same place as the dinner itself; the arrangement proved popular and has continued more or less ever Since.\n\nThe Holgate Portrait\n\nThe only known portrait of our Founder belongs to the Holgate Hospital at Hemsworth (founded under the terms of Robert Holgate's will); it hangs in the Governor's Room at the hospital. The Society arranged for Eric Westbrook, Principal of the Wakefield School of Art, to make a copy and this was on show for the first time at the meeting on 12 January 1949. It was subsequently handed over, on \"permanent loan\", at a ceremony held at the School on 18 February 1949.\n\nThis dinner also witnessed the introduction of the first of a series of post-prandial discussions. The topic was \"CRIME\",introduced by Harry Ward who had himself lived in an English prison for two years and had studied the prison systems of several countries. The conclusion was \"that the present crime wave is likely to grow for a while and then die down again to the astonishing orderliness which characterised us before the war\"\n\nThe November 1949 reunion was an important one for the Society and the School. Our guest speaker was Rt. Hon. J Bowes Morrell, Lord Mayor of York. His speech mainly concerned proposals and arrangements for York's celebration of the forthcoming 1951 Festival of Britain. He also announced that consideration was being given to the establishment of a new (or second) University in York. Alderman Morrell played a leading part in the successful launch of the University at Heslington in mid-1963, a few weeks before our own new school was opened on adjacent land. The Alderman's name is commemorated by the University's main library; The J B Morrell Library. The Archbishop Holgate Society was active in a number of ways in assisting the start-up of both the University and the new school - but this is a story too long to detail here."}], "Robert Holgate was a prelate.": [{"url": "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/abs/church-in-transition-the-intriguing-use-of-the-pallium-in-tudor-england/DC153D8B2281A370EF367112C92B6E92", "page_content": "Setting the context The break with Rome in the 1530s brought many challenges for the English Church as, following the extirpation of Roman jurisdiction under Henry viii, that body no longer owed obedience to Rome. Following the accession of Edward vi a Protestant Church emerged, to be cut short on the accession of his half-sister Mary. England's reconciliation with Rome was then itself swept away by Elizabeth's religious settlement after Mary's death in 1558. Throughout this quarter century, the question of authority and power in the Church was much debated. In a body cut off from Roman jurisdiction, where was the source of authority and what was the relationship between the papacy, monarchy and episcopacy? This article attempts to provide answers to those questions by looking at the intriguing use of the pallium as a symbol of the power of an archbishop as metropolitan of his province. The opening sections of this article draw a picture of the nature of royal supremacy and episcopal authority from the reign of Henry viii through to the death of Mary. This picture essentially sketches the main sources of episcopal authority and jurisdiction in the period 1533\u201358 and provides a backdrop for the central emphasis of the essay, an examination of the differing uses of the pallium \u2013 a woollen vestment symbolising the jurisdiction which a metropolitan archbishop enjoyed \u2013 from Henry's break with Rome to the death of Elizabeth in 1603. The meaning and significance of the garment changed from reign to reign and an attempt will be made to unravel the meanings behind its use and to draw conclusions on the resulting source and nature of episcopal jurisdiction in Tudor England.\n\nProclaiming the royal supremacy, 1533\u201347 It was the Act of Supremacy of November 1534 which formally stated that the king and his successors should be acknowledged as supreme head of the Church.Footnote 1 Such an overt assertion, however, called into question the prevailing consensus on the source of authority in that Church. When Thomas Cranmer undertook a metropolitical visitation of Canterbury province in 1533\u20135, the bishops of London, Winchester, Exeter, Norwich and Lincoln all protested against Cranmer's actions, as did the President and Fellows of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.Footnote 2 When Stephen Gardiner at Winchester received his citation, he stressed that Cranmer's use of the title \u2018primate of all England\u2019 was in derogation of the king's position as supreme head of the Church. The issue at stake, the source of authority in the English Church, was tackled by the Henrician government which delivered commissions to the bishops for the exercise of their jurisdiction. It was for the king, as supreme head of the Church, to instruct the episcopate with rules by which their episcopal functions were to be deployed. Thomas Cranmer's Henrician commission was issued out of the court of Thomas Cromwell, who acted as the king's vicegerent in ecclesiastical causes.Footnote 3 This commission covers administrative powers formerly exercised by medieval archbishops of Canterbury following provision by the pope. Cranmer was able to ordain men to livings, to institute men to benefices in the diocese of Canterbury, to collate clerics to livings in his gift, to prove the wills of men having goods, rights and credits (\u2018bona, iura sive credita\u2019) in more than one diocese according to the custom of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, to proceed in causes in his courts and to do all else necessary. However, Cranmer's powers were now made to rest explicitly on the king's position as supreme head of the Church. Significantly, Cranmer's commission did not authorise him to undertake visitations. The purpose of this omission was to allow the crown itself to undertake a visitation of the Church through the vicegerent. An inhibition was addressed to Cranmer, and through him to the diocesan bishops, in September 1535. By the terms of this, ecclesiastical officials were forbidden to exercise their powers of jurisdiction.Footnote 4 Further traces of royal activity are rather thin on the ground. However, two sets of injunctions were issued in 1536 and 1538, which helped to shape the future direction of the English Church and the duties of those who sat on the episcopal bench.Footnote 5 The visitation ended in 1537 and powers of visitation were returned to the bishops. Edward Fox at Hereford seems to have been the first prelate to receive such a licence.Footnote 6 Cranmer's licence has not survived, but it is clear from his letters that he did receive one.Footnote 7 The role of the king as supreme head of the Church continued in the reign of Edward vi, whose government adopted a position similar to that of the previous monarch. Cranmer's commission as archbishop of Canterbury lasted at Henry's pleasure only and, accordingly, it had lapsed on Henry's death in 1547. The Edwardian regime proceeded to issue fresh commissions and Cranmer received his from Edward on 7 February 1547.Footnote 8 Edward likewise undertook royal visitations and issued injunctions.Footnote 9 The new commission, at pleasure, to Thomas Cranmer empowered him to exercise his jurisdiction within the diocese and province of Canterbury. The preamble emphasised that the powers of all magistrates, both ecclesiastical and secular, emanated from the crown and from the king as supreme head. Such jurisdiction had been exercised precariously, and the king wished men to recognise that it was granted by the crown alone. In response to the archbishop's requests, the king licensed him to ordain men from the diocese of Canterbury who were suitable in learning and morals. He could admit, institute, invest or deprive those presented to benefices within the diocese, if they were suitable, and collate men to benefices in his own gift. He was to prove the wills of those who had goods in several dioceses or jurisdictions, and to administer the goods of all those who died intestate, according to the custom of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, and to prove wills and administer goods within his diocese. He could judge all ecclesiastical causes which came before him; he could also appoint deputies. A general clause empowered him to do all else necessary \u2018beyond and above those tasks which are acknowledged to be granted to you by God in Holy Scripture\u2019 (\u2018preter et ultra ea que tibi ex sacris litteris divinitus commisa dinoscuntur\u2019). Any previous inhibition of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was to be of no effect. The king enjoined the archbishop to perform his office according to the norms of Holy Scripture and to ensure that he admit no one to holy orders or to have cure of souls unless their character, learning and other qualifications were exemplary, for the corruption of all virtue, especially within the Christian religion, stemmed from wicked pastors. If faithful shepherds were appointed, the king did not doubt but that the true religion of Christ would be restored and an improvement in men's lives and manners ensue.\n\nThe accession of Mary I: all change, 1553\u20138 The accession of Mary to the throne in 1553 posed enormous challenges for the Tudor episcopate and for the question of authority in the Church. The consensus of Henry's years, following the break with Rome, and of Edward vi\u2019s reign could no longer apply when Mary wished to return the Church to Roman obedience. How would this transition be made and where then would the locus of authority in the Church be found? When Mary issued writs for her first convocation on 14 August 1553, Cranmer's register at Lambeth shows that these documents used a royal style entirely in keeping with that of her half-brother, Edward vi, and her father Henry viii. The writ styled the monarch as \u2018Mary, by the grace of God queen of England, France and Ireland, defender of the faith and supreme head of the English and Irish Church\u2019 (\u2018MARIA DEI GRACIA ANGLIE, FRANCIE ET HIBERNIE regina FIDEI DEFENSOR et in terra ecclesie Anglicane et Hibernice supremum caput\u2019).Footnote 10 Mary's use of the title \u2018supreme head\u2019, however, was not to last, for she was determined to restore papal supremacy and to repeal the religious acts passed by her father. The reference to \u2018supreme head\u2019 was included in the style and title prefixed to the parliamentary record for 1 Mary session 2 (24 Oct.\u2013 6 Dec 1553). Later it was omitted on Mary's decision, without parliamentary approval, in the style and title prefixed to the record for 1 Mary session 3 (2 Apr.\u20135 May 1554), and presumably remained omitted in all documents up to her marriage \u2013 and proclamation of her joint style and title with Philip of Spain \u2013 on 25 July 1554. In July 1554 the joint style of Philip and Mary was announced as \u2018Philip and Mary, by the grace of God king and queen of England, France, Naples, Jerusalem, and Ireland; defenders of the faith; princes of Spain and Sicily; archdukes of Austria; dukes of Milan, Burgundy, and Brabant; counts of Hapsburg, Flanders, and Tyrol\u2019 (\u2018Philippus et Maria, Dei gratia rex et regina Anglie, Francie, Neapolis, Ierusalem, et Hibernie; fidei defensores; principes Hispanie et Sicilie; archiduces Austrie; duces Mediolani, Burgundie, et Brabancie; comites Haspurgi, Flandrie, et Tirolis\u2019). Further changes applied later in the reign, but the use of the title \u2018supreme head\u2019 did not figure in Mary's official style after July 1554.Footnote 11 It was officially abolished by Mary's second Repeal Act of 1554, which restored the ecclesiastical status quo of 1529.Footnote 12 Although Mary rejected the use of the style \u2018supremum caput\u2019, she was certainly capable of using powers formerly associated with the title when it suited her. She did not issue commissions to the bishops of her realm, but was happy in 1554 to use the mechanism of royal injunctions.Footnote 13 These made it clear that no bishop was to style himself \u2018supported by royal authority\u2019 (\u2018regia auctoritate fulcitus\u2019), nor was an oath of supremacy to be demanded of ecclesiastics. Mary was focussed on reconciling the kingdom to Rome and this formed the basis of her polity for transforming the Church.Footnote 14 On becoming queen she inherited twenty-three bishops, all of whom had accepted the Edwardian settlement; two bishoprics were vacant (Rochester and Bangor) and John Hooper held two sees (Gloucester and Worcester). Under her half-brother Edward vi, bishops had been appointed by the simple issue of letter patent.Footnote 15 This process was abolished by Mary's first Repeal Act of 1553.Footnote 16 The man who would support her in this was Cardinal Reginald Pole, for it was he who was tasked with reconciling the realm to the Holy See and with repatriating the episcopate as an instrument of that reconciliation after years of schism. Looking back on events in 1556, as he addressed the citizens of London, Pole saw that it was Henry's assumption of the supreme headship which was the start of disaster: \u2018And in lyke maner, all the tyme the arche was in the Kynge's hande, as yt was, he takynge that straunge tytle upon him, to be Hedd of the Chyrche in his realme.\u2019Footnote 17 Pole's original commissions are recorded in his Canterbury register at Lambeth.Footnote 18 He was awarded two sets of Faculties \u2013 the Bulla Facultatum Communium and the Facultatem Extraordinarium, both dated 5 August 1553. However, these were not specific enough and on 8 March 1554 the pope issued an amplification of Pole's powers.Footnote 19 These new powers were particularly important in allowing Pole to reconstitute the English episcopate. The new faculties enabled him to confirm the appointments of bishops made by Henry viii and Edward vi, and to provide men for vacant sees at the request of the queen. Those bishops appointed under Henry could exercise their gift of consecration or, if it had not been received, obtain it from a Catholic bishop. Those appointed under Edward could be promoted to all orders, including the priesthood; in addition they could be given the \u2018gift of consecration\u2019 (\u2018munus consecrationis\u2019). A marked feature of Marian episcopal polity before Pole arrived in England was the widespread deprivation of priests.Footnote 20 By June 1554 thirteen Edwardian bishops had been deprived. Of these, six had been ordained with the Edwardian Ordinal, so their status as bishops was disallowed as well.Footnote 21 Mary was in need of new bishops as replacements and proceeded to appoint them. These men, however, first needed dispensation from ecclesiastical censures. Pole provided this and proof is found in his legatine register, Registrum expeditorum in Anglia factarum per illustrissimum & reverendissimum cardinalem Polum legatum, a neglected resource for Tudor church history.Footnote 22 In a dispensation issued outside Paris (before he even arrived in England) and dated 17 March 1554, Pole absolved seven named episcopal candidates from heresy and schism.Footnote 23 The seven men were Robert Wharton, John White, Gilbert Bourne, James Brooks, George Cotes, Henry Morgan and Maurice Griffith. Wharton had already been consecrated as bishop of St Asaph in Henry viii\u2019s reign in 1536. That consecration being regarded as valid, reconsecration was deemed unnecessary and a dispensation was all that was required. The remaining six men were all consecrated together on 1 April 1554.Footnote 24 Pole's actions were interesting because, technically speaking, his legatine authority was not valid in England until 10 November 1554, and actually his attainder could not be repealed until parliament on the 22nd.Footnote 25 These episcopal appointments established a process for the formal appointment of new bishops in communion with the see of Rome to support England's reconciliation to the Holy See. The next stage in rehabilitating the kingdom to Rome took place on 30 November, when Pole formally absolved the Church from schism.Footnote 26 The reconciliation emphasised that Henry viii and Edward vi, at the instigation of the devil, had passed laws against the pope, and specifically laws stating that the king was supreme head. Rejecting such claims, Pole absolved the whole realm through his powers as legate a latere, restoring everything to a pristine state. Pole's actions in appointing new bishops in March 1554 threw a light on the need to reconcile bishops already in post and his legatine register shows how this was accomplished. Records are found here for the reconciliation of bishops, for example Cuthbert Tunstall at Durham, George Day at Chichester, Robert Aldrich at Carlisle and John Chamber at Peterborough.Footnote 27 Not all the individual reconciliations are recorded; there is, for example, no record for Stephen Gardiner at Winchester. Restored in August 1553, Gardiner apparently asked for absolution, or at least expressed his repentance in a letter, now missing. Instead of granting absolution, Pole emphasised God's grace to Gardiner which had prevented him from falling into heresy after schism. Pole told Gardiner in a second letter that obedience must come first.Footnote 28 Following the actions of November 1554, the reconciliation of the kingdom to Rome needed to be promulgated and Pole saw that the bishops were key to this task. He delivered instructions to them on 29 January 1555, and to other officials, on how to tackle this job. When announcing the reconciliation, bishops and others were specifically to dwell on the misery of Henry viii\u2019s schism.Footnote 29 Pole stressed that, since Canterbury province represented almost all persons in the kingdom, it was impossible for him personally to reconcile everyone. Therefore, he was delegating this task to his bishops and other officials. Pole's legatine register shows how widely this faculty was disseminated. The document is headed \u2018Faculty to be granted to each and every bishop\u2019 (\u2018Facultas singulis episcopis concedenda\u2019).Footnote 30 The registered copy is addressed to Stephen Gardiner as bishop of Winchester and the legatine register goes onFootnote 31 to list all the recipients of this document. The list is headed by a group of nineteen bishops \u2013 London, Bristol, Gloucester, Durham, Bath and Wells, Lincoln, Chester, Rochester, Norwich, St David's, Chichester, Carlisle, Coventry and Lichfield, Hereford, Peterborough, Oxford, Salisbury, Llandaff and Worcester. Other recipients are listed after this.Footnote 32 The bishops clearly understood the import of what Pole was asking them to do. After Gardiner, the first named recipient in Pole's legatine register is Edmund Bonner, bishop of London. Bonner received Pole's commission dated 29 January 1555, and on 19 February he sent it to the archdeacons of London, Middlesex, Essex, St Albans and Colchester to be published in their archdeaconries. He added a covering note telling the archdeacons to select learned men to deal with any queries about absolution and to absolve their clerics first before their flocks.Footnote 33 The years 1533\u201358 were crucial in determining the role of the episcopate in early modern England. Immediately following the extirpation of Roman jurisdiction, bishops effectively became civil servants under the crown. Henry never claimed an overt power of orders (\u2018potestas ordinis\u2019) over the clergy, but he issued commissions to the bishops, inhibited their jurisdictions, undertook royal visitations, drew up injunctions and firmly grounded the authority of the episcopate in the role of the king as supreme head. As with Henry viii, so with his son Edward vi, who continued the Henrician mode of management in the Church. Henry's daughter Mary quickly renounced the title supreme head, although she was still capable of using those powers formerly associated with this rank. Her need to reconcile the English Church to Rome resulted in a series of elaborate processes to deprive schismatical bishops, rehabilitate others and then appoint fresh blood to the episcopal bench. Inherent in this move was a reliance on the renewed role of the episcopate to effect reconciliation. The role of a bishop had thus been both defined and reinterpreted in the twenty-five years after 1533. What significance did this have for the traditional emblems of episcopal authority and power? It is this which is the main subject of this article.\n\nThe use of the pallium at the break with Rome In the medieval Church, the symbol of authority for a metropolitan archbishop was the pallium \u2013 for many centuries bestowed by the pope on metropolitans and primates as a symbol of the jurisdiction delegated to them by Rome. The pallium signified the fullness of the pontifical office (\u2018plenitudinem pontificalis officii\u2019) which an archbishop was to enjoy as metropolitan of his province. Nicholas Hawkins, successor to Thomas Cranmer as ambassador to Emperor Charles v, wrote to Henry viii from Bologna on 22 February 1533 that \u2018This pall is a pece of white cloth made of the wool of certen lambis, whiche the Pope halowith, and consecrate [sic] bi the Pope, and leide upon St Petre his sepulchre.\u2019Footnote 34 The bulls for Thomas Cranmer's canonical appointment to the see of Canterbury are recorded in his register at Lambeth.Footnote 35 The government wanted a prelate, outwardly in communion with Rome, who would be able to end Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon. On 22 February 1533 there was despatched notification to the archbishop of the form of the oath of loyalty to be taken to the Holy See at his consecration.Footnote 36 On 3 March notification was sent to Cranmer (via the archbishop of York and the bishop of London) of the despatch of the pallium.Footnote 37 The form of words to be used at the bestowal of the pallium is carefully recorded. Cranmer was to note that the garment was \u2018taken from the body of St Peter, symbolising the fullness of the pontifical office\u2019 (\u2018de corpore Beati Petri sumptum, plenitudinem videlicet pontificalis officii\u2019).Footnote 38 The wording of all the papal bulls was in common form throughout. The form of the oath of loyalty to the holy see, which Cranmer was to swear, was exactly the same, with minor verbal variations, as that sworn by William Warham on his translation to Canterbury.Footnote 39 On 21 February Hawkins wrote to the king concerning the cost of the bulls, telling him that the pallium would cost 1,000 ducats.Footnote 40 The use of the pallium in Cranmer's consecration is illustrated in what is otherwise a very odd document in Cranmer's register \u2013 a protestation, made several times during the ceremony, by which Cranmer wished to make clear that, despite his papal bull of provision, he would accept his appointment at the hands of the king and of no one else. It was, morally, a dubious act and legally an act of perjury. However, Cranmer swore this protestation as a matter of conscience and the king, desperate to secure a canonically-appointed archbishop, supported him and advised him how to proceed to salve his conscience.Footnote 41 After the solemnities of his consecration in St Stephen's chapel, Westminster, the archbishop stood before the high altar \u2018to receive the pallium\u2019 (\u2018ante dictum summum altare pallium recepturus\u2019). Before he would recite the form of words prescribed to be read, Cranmer again swore that he understood the words only in the sense of his earlier protestation. He swore an oath of loyalty to the pope, but made clear that he understood its terms only in the sense of his earlier protestation. It was in 1534 that the government issued new regulations for the appointment of bishops.Footnote 42 After 1534 letters missive sent by the crown to the cathedral chapter became in effect papal bulls of provision. Capitular election of the royal nominee and metropolitical confirmation of that election were simply formalities to complete the process. As late as 1535 renunciations of papal jurisdiction were obtained from bishops appointed before the statute of 1534. Seventeen renunciations survive, eleven dating from February, four from March, one from April and one from June.Footnote 43 So thorough were the government's actions that even bishops appointed after the statute of 1534 made the renunciation.Footnote 44 Cranmer formally renounced his appointment at the hands of the pope on 10 February 1535.Footnote 45 With minor variations, the text is the same as that sworn by Roland Lee.Footnote 46 The oath made no explicit mention of the pallium, even though the bestowal of this garment was closely linked in the medieval English Church with the offering of an oath of loyalty to the pope. It was to be a significant omission, and it helps to explain how the Tudor Church continued to use the pallium after the break with Rome.\n\nLater uses of the pallium, 1534\u201340 Historians have sometimes noted the use of the pallium in heraldic devices after the English Church's break with Rome and Cranmer himself used it in glass in his palaces. Such stained glass, dated to about 1535, survives in the Victoria and Albert Museum; this has Cranmer's arms which use the pallium, along with his motto \u2018Nosce teipsum et deum\u2019 (\u2018Know yourself and God\u2019).Footnote 47 The pallium was also used as an illustrative device in Cranmer's seals.Footnote 48 A good example appears in the two states of Cranmer's general seal, 1534 and 1540. In this seal, the martyrdom of Archbishop Thomas Becket has been replaced by a representation of the crucifixion. This change took place from 1538 and underlines both Cranmer's support for the royal supremacy and his own evangelical leanings. Even in 1540, however, the pallium still appears (as an intriguing decorative feature) as part of the altered impaled coat of arms of the archdiocese and priory at the bottom left (the dexter side) in the later seal. No further evidence has yet been found concerning the use of the pallium in the sixteenth century in such architectural or formal archival settings. However, the main use of this garment after the break with Rome was as part of the procedure for archiepiscopal appointments. During Cranmer's rule, the archbishop was called upon to confirm elections to archiepiscopal sees. Robert Holgate was appointed to York in 1545 and George Browne to Dublin in 1536.Footnote 49 In both cases, the solemnities of consecration included the bestowal of the pallium. In the acts recording the consecration of George Browne to Dublin, the record shows that on 19 March 1536 the archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the bishops of Salisbury and Worcester, consecrated Browne and surrendered the pallium to him. The relevant documents comprise two sets of letters patent giving the king's assent to Browne's election to the see of Dublin and a note of Browne's consecration, when the pallium was handed to him. Both sets of letters patent were formally despatched to the archbishop, which is why they have been entered in the legal record of Browne's appointment and consecration in Cranmer's register. Both letters bear the same date, 13 March 1536. The first letter is general in tone and makes no mention of the relevant parliamentary statute governing the appointment, nor of the grant of the pallium. This was not good enough, and a second copy of the letters patent was despatched, clearly asking the archbishop to confirm Browne's election, to consecrate him as archbishop and to bestow the pallium upon him. Browne was to receive episcopal insignia and Cranmer was commanded to perform all that was necessary in that regard. The record of Browne's appointment in Cranmer's register is full, but the surviving documents contain no real definition as to the meaning that the pallium now held, following the extirpation of Roman jurisdiction in England. The records do, however, make three things clear: it was for the crown to command that the pallium be granted to the incoming archbishop as metropolitan; it was the role of the archbishop of Canterbury to bestow the pallium at the request of the crown; and the pallium was a sign of Browne's new archiepiscopal authority, although how and why this is the case is not discussed.Footnote 50\n\nUses of the pallium, 1540\u20137 Robert Holgate was nominated to the see of York in 1545. His York register contains no relevant material concerning his appointment,Footnote 51 but the documents entered into Cranmer's register are much fuller and can be divided into four sections. It is instructive to compare the form of the materials in Cranmer's register which relate to Holgate's appointment to York with those recorded in Henry Chichele's Canterbury register over a century earlier,Footnote 52 because there are significant differences. The dominant figure in Chichele's appointment is the pope himself. It is the pope who sends the pallium and this action dictates the sequence of events thereafter as, on its receipt, Chichele immediately offered an oath of loyalty to the Holy See. Over a century later, how exactly was the pallium administered to Holgate and what was its significance and meaning? The documents in Cranmer's register shed light on this.Footnote 53 On 26 January 1545 the archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the bishops of Westminster and Chichester, assembled in the chapel at Lambeth Palace. All the stages in the confirmation of Holgate's election were completed on that day and Cranmer then issued his definitive sentence. Following this, the archbishop's chaplain, dressed in appropriate vestments, celebrated a private mass. After the mass, the archbishop of York, dressed in pontificals, knelt before Cranmer and his colleagues, who were sitting in front of the altar wearing their mitres. The archbishop of Canterbury blessed the pallium, a sign of the fullness of the archiepiscopal office and, with his fellow bishops as his assistants, he laid it on the archbishop of York's shoulders, following the confirmation of his election. Cranmer was requested to inform the king that he had confirmed the election, but that the archdeacon of York should be ordered to enthrone the new archbishop, according to custom. Cranmer agreed, ordering that public instruments be drawn up to record all the acts. Cranmer's register shows, as in the records concerning Browne's appointment to Dublin, that it was the role of the archbishop of Canterbury formally to invest the new archbishop with the pallium. When Cranmer received his pallium in 1533, the garment was first blessed by the pope.Footnote 54 For Holgate, it was Cranmer who blessed the woollen pallium and bestowed it on the new archbishop. When Holgate was appointed to York, the significance of the pallium is described simply and plainly as \u2018a sign of the fullness of the archiepiscopal office\u2019. Holgate required no consecration as he proceeded to York from the see of Llandaff;Footnote 55 the bestowal of the pallium therefore took place after a celebration of the mass. Cranmer blessed the pallium and then he and his episcopal colleagues laid it on Holgate's shoulders. In this record, the pallium is not even connected to Holgate's oath of obedience to the king. At Cranmer's own consecration, in 1533, the pallium was closely linked to the new archbishop swearing an oath of loyalty to the pope. Clearly, in Holgate's appointment to York, there is no reference to the pope. Instead, Holgate swore an oath to the king, his heirs and successors, according to a statute of 35 Henry VIII,Footnote 56 and the archbishop of Canterbury then delivered the definitive sentence. The bestowal of the pallium took place later in the ceremonies, in fact after the private mass which was celebrated by Cranmer's chaplain. Holgate was present in person throughout the whole proceedings and Cranmer had invited him to sit on a throne next to his.Footnote 57 The placing of the bestowal of the pallium at the end of the ceremonies seems to confirm the vagueness in the significance of that garment in the English Church of the 1540s. Section 2 of the acts in Holgate's appointment adds little to our understanding. The trigger for the pallium to be given to Holgate by Cranmer was once again the receipt by the latter of a mandate from the king signifying his assent to Holgate's appointment, ordering Cranmer to bestow the pallium and to invest Holgate with appropriate insignia. Similarly, section 3 says little more, being a set of summary articles from the dean and chapter of York, which were delivered by their proctor to Cranmer in Lambeth. Article 6 confirms that, in letters patent, the king signified his assent to the archbishop of Canterbury and his assistant bishops to Holgate's appointment, ordering them to confirm the election, to bestow the pallium and to invest the new archbishop with appropriate insignia. Section 4 of the acts, however, is much more informative, as it gives a detailed description of the prayers and form of words to be used before, during and after the blessing and bestowal of the pallium. What is the significance of these texts and what do they reveal about the use of the pallium in Holgate's appointment? The prayers before the bestowal of that garment reveal that it was to be regarded as a sign of Holgate's archiepiscopal authority (\u2018hoc pontificalis dignitatis plenitudinis insigne\u2019). All those who possessed such a symbol of honour were to use it before the people so that it could illuminate their deeds and grant heavenly rewards. Here the emphasis is not on the recipient, nor the donor, but on the people who are witnesses to the use of the pallium. When it is blessed by being sprinkled with water, the invocation is to the Almighty (in whose honour the pallium is used) to bless that garment. Further clarity comes from the forms and words used at the bestowal of the pallium itself. The source of human authority for the bestowal of the garment is naturally different from that laid down in medieval canon law. A comparison of the form of words used in 1414 when Henry Chichele was provided to the see of Canterbury by the pope with those used at Holgate's appointment in 1545 reveals the point.Footnote 58 Whereas the fifteenth-century formula stressed that the pallium was taken \u2018from the body of St Peter\u2019 (\u2018de corpore Beati Petri\u2019), the sixteenth-century text omitted all reference to St Peter and stressed simply that the pallium was \u2018a sign of the priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ\u2019 (\u2018sacerdotii domini nostri Jesu Christi signum\u2019). More significantly, however, the fifteenth-century text laid down that the pope was the sole human agent responsible for the bestowal of the woollen garment. The Tudor rite, however, maintained that the pallium was bestowed in honour of Henry viii \u2018to whom, and to none other, you have a duty of obedience and loyalty, to the honour of the English Church\u2019 (\u2018cui soli et nulli alii obedienciam et fidelitatem debes et exhibuisti in decus ecclesie Anglicane\u2019). Finally, at the end of Holgate's record, the focus switches to its recipient, with an invocation to the Almighty to illumine the archbishop, whom he has honoured with the holiness of the pallium.\n\nThe significance of the use of the pallium in the Henrician Church The surviving records highlight an interesting dilemma which faced a Church cut off from Roman jurisdiction. In Cranmer's appointment to Canterbury, the crown needed an archbishop outwardly in communion with Rome to settle Henry's marital cause with Catherine of Aragon. Here, the pallium was despatched from Rome according to precedent and a reluctant archbishop forced to accept it. Why did the Tudor Church, why did the archbishop of Canterbury, continue to use this garment after the break with Rome? Was it the new order trying to cling to pieces of the old which had no meaning in a new context? Although the records are fragmentary, the appointment of Browne to Dublin and Holgate to York show that this was not the case. First and foremost, the pallium was now a sign of the crown's supremacy in the Church. This is why the records stress repeatedly that it is for the king to bestow this garment on the archbishop. Clearly, this is a fundamental change in the medieval understanding of the pallium, where it was bestowed by the pope himself, with the garment being taken from the body of St Peter. The Henrician Church therefore infused the garment with a new symbolism. It remained a symbol of an archbishop's authority, but an authority which was bestowed by the crown and enunciated in the royal grant of a commission to Cranmer for the exercise of his jurisdiction. Holgate's appointment to York reveals further subtleties in the continued use of the pallium, which were not known in the medieval Church and may not have underpinned the appointment of Browne to Dublin. Do these changes indicate a developing view in the English Church of the use of this garment? Alas, the sources are too fleeting for us to be sure, but it may be that this was the case. At various points in Holgate's ceremony, the emphasis on the use of the garment falls on the people who witness the ceremonies, and on Holgate himself as the recipient. In terms of the use of the pallium in the late medieval Church, these are not definitions of use which would have been accorded to the garment of lamb's wool being used. The pallium is also called a sign of the priesthood of Jesus Christ himself, not simply a sign of archiepiscopal authority. Is this a reflection of an attempt by Cranmer to infuse additional evangelical meaning into the retention of a medieval garment? The surviving evidence does not allow us to be sure, and Holgate's record is quick to emphasise that the bestowal of the pallium is a sign of the supremacy of Henry viii in the Church.Footnote 59 It is clear, none the less, that the bestowal of the pallium was not an anachronism, nor a casual survival of a medieval symbol.Footnote 60 It was rather a powerful demonstration of the reality of the royal supremacy within the Church. When Henry viii claimed to bestow this garment upon Holgate and Browne of Dublin, the nature of that insignia changed from being papal and sacerdotal to political and religious. The pallium continued to be a sign of metropolitical authority, but it was for the king alone on earth to appoint archbishops and to bestow jurisdiction upon them."}, {"url": "http://www.historyofyork.org.uk/themes/tudor-stuart/robert-holgate-archbishop", "page_content": "1545AD - 1554AD\n\nRobert Holgate from a Yorkshire family, was educated in Cambridge and entered the Gilbertine order as a canon.

But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk. A new school, the Yeoman School, was built next door. Opened in 1846 this was intended to cater for the 'middle class children' of agriculturalists, as well as to provide teaching practice for student teachers at St John's.\n\nThe new school ran into financial difficulties, however, and in 1858, after 300 years in Ogleforth, Archbishop Holgate's School took it over.\n\nThe iron gates to the school's playing fields seem to have been designed between 1850 and 1860 by George Townsend Andrews, the architect who had designed St John's College itself. They were made by the Walmgate-based Walker Iron Foundry, which also made railings and gates for the British Museum, as well as others across York, including in St Leonard's Place, York Cemetery, Dean's Park and at St Peter's School.\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School thrived in its new location in Lord Mayor's Walk. By 1915, when the Rev William Johnson retired as headmaster, the school had 294 pupils.\n\nBy then, the school had leased part of Bootham Stray for playing fields, which is why the school playing field gates - which were restored in 2017 by York Civic Trust working with York Hospital - are there to this day.\n\nThe school itself moved to its present site on Hull Road in 1963.\n\nStephen Lewis\n\nFor the stories behind more York Civic Trust plaques, visit yorkcivictrust.co.uk"}, {"url": "https://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/agents/people/1587", "page_content": "Dates\n\nExistence: 1859 - 1945\n\nBiography\n\nThomas Franklin Holgate was born on April 8, 1859, in Hastings County, Ontario, Canada, the son of Thomas and Eleanor Wright Holgate. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Victoria College, University of Toronto, in 1884, and a Master's degree, in absentia, from the same institution in 1889. Holgate came to Northwestern University in 1893 as a mathematics professor. He served as Dean of the College of Liberal Arts for 17 years and two terms as acting president of the University.\n\n\n\nHolgate began his professional teaching career in 1874, teaching in the public school system of Ontario. Upon graduation from college in 1884, he became a mathematics master (instructor) at Albert College, Belleville, Ontario. He remained in this position until 1890 when he became a fellow at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. He received a Ph.D. from Clark University in 1893. He joined the Northwestern University faculty in 1893 as an instructor in the Mathematics Department. During the year, he became involved in the activities of the first International Congress of Mathematicians held in conjunction with the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1893. He also devoted considerable attention to the preparation of a series of Colloquium Lectures by Felix Klein held in Evanston following the Congress.\n\n\n\nIn 1894, after only one year at Northwestern, he was made a full professor. In 1897, he played an instrumental role in the formation of the Chicago section of the American Mathematical Society and served as Secretary from 1897 to 1905. In 1902, he was appointed Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, a position he held for the next seventeen years.\n\n\n\nIn 1904, following the resignation of President Edmund James, Holgate was appointed President Ad Interim of Northwestern University. He served in this capacity until the selection of Abram Harris as President in 1906. During his first two-year term as acting president, the Norman Harris Lecture Foundation was established, a department of education was added to the College of Liberal Arts, a training school for nurses was established, the geology, zoology, and romance language departments were enlarged, the athletic field on Central Street was opened, and the University was able to pay off a quarter-million-dollar debt. Additionally, he served as Secretary for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition held in St. Louis in 1904.\n\n\n\nBetween 1906 and 1916, Holgate held the Noyes Professorship of Pure Mathematics, secured legislation for revision and codification of the Illinois school laws, traveled to Rome where he was Secretary/Delegate to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1908, and was a member of a commission to reorganize the Chicago Public Library.\n\n\n\nIn 1916, with the resignation of Abram Harris, Holgate was once again called upon to serve as acting president of the University. As acting president from 1916 to 1919, Holgate instituted democratic reforms in the selection of deans; Northwestern was elected to membership in the Association of American Universities; the Law School's course of study was lengthened to four years; degree courses in physical education and public speaking were installed; student military training was established on campus; and 3,600 soldiers and sailors were trained in mechanical subjects as part of the University's commitment to the United States' war effort.\n\n\n\nDuring World War I, Holgate assisted Walter Dill Scott in personnel work for the War Department. He was also influential in the formation of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and served as President from 1917 to 1918.\n\n\n\nIn 1919, with the selection of Lynn Harold Hough as President of the University, Holgate retired from his major administrative duties and was made Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts. He continued, however, to teach mathematics for the next fifteen years, retiring in 1934. He spent the 1921-,22 academic year in China as a visiting professor at the University of Nanking. His experiences in China served to reinforce an interest in foreign students and he acted as their advisor upon his return to Northwestern.\n\n\n\nHolgate's research interests were in the fields of pure geometry and ruled surfaces of the fourth order. His translation of Theodore Reye's Geometrie der Lage (Geometry of Position) was published in 1898. His other published works include Elementary Geometry (1901) and Projective Pure Geometry (1930). He also wrote a \u201cHistory of the Mathematics Department at Northwestern University, 1855-1905,\u201d and a thirty-page summary of Northwestern University's activities during World War I, \u201cNorthwestern in the Great War.\u201d\n\n\n\nHolgate received honorary Doctor of Law degrees from the University of Illinois in 1905, Queen's University in 1919, and Northwestern University in 1937. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the University Club of Evanston, the University Club of Chicago, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his university activities, Holgate was prominent in civic and religious affairs and was particularly concerned with administrative problems of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He served five terms as a member of the Methodist Church's General Conference; was a member of its Board of Education for Negroes; and from 1924 to his death in 1945, was a member of the church's Board of Education, serving as its treasurer from 1934 to 1938. From 1923 to 1925, he was president of the Chicago Church Federation. In recognition of his support of educational opportunities for black students, the library at Bennett College in North Carolina was named for him.\n\n\n\nDean Holgate was married twice. On August 2, 1885, in Bath, Ontario, Canada, he married Julia Caroline Sharp, the daughter of a local farmer, John Sharp. She died in 1887. His second marriage to Georgina Angela Burdette, the daughter of Daniel Burdette, a. manufacturer, took place in Newburgh, Ontario, Canada, July 23, 1890. The Holgates had four children: Eleanor, born in 1894, who later married the noted scholar, Owen Lattimore; Robert Burdette, born in 1895; Barbara (Mrs. George H. Young), born in 1899, and Frances Burdette, born in 1902.\n\n\n\nThomas Franklin Holgate died of a heart ailment in Evanston at the age of 86 on April 11, 1945. Funeral services were held on April 13, 1945 at the First Methodist Church of Evanston.\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that his formal title was that of President Ad Interim, Holgate was one of the most accomplished, significant, and influential administrators in Northwestern's history, and enjoyed an extraordinarily long and productive academic career, while maintaining an avid interest in foreign, civic and religious affairs.\n\nFound in 1 Collection or Record:"}, {"url": "https://stirnet.com/genie/data/british/hh4bz/holgate1.php", "page_content": "\n\n'Holgate1' Index links to: Lead / Letter\n\nFamilies covered: Holgate of Stapleton, Holgate of Walden\n\nRobert Holgate\n\nm.

He lived in the house of the former abbot of St Mary\u2019s Abbey in York, which has survived as King\u2019s Manor.\n\nFollowing the death of Archbishop Lee in September 1544, Holgate was named his successor and was consecrated as Archbishop of York at Lambeth in January 1545, renouncing papal authority.\n\nFrom then, the tenets of Protestant theology were regularly expounded in the Minster for the first time, and organ music was abolished. He instructed that the Minster Library be furnished with new Protestant commentaries on the Bible by theologians like Calvin.\n\nArchbishop Holgate founded three grammar schools in 1546, one at his birthplace of Hemsworth in the West Riding, one at Old Malton and one in York. He required his headmasters to be skilled in Hebrew, Greek and Latin and to take his pupils to the Minster on Sundays.\n\nIn order to prove his Protestantism to the sceptical Duke of Northumberland, in 1550, aged 68, the Archbishop took a bride when he was 68 \u2013 local gentlewoman Barbara Wentworth. This was a year after an Act of Parliament removed the duty of celibacy from the English clergy.\n\nBut when Queen Mary came to the throne in 1553 and returned England to Catholicism, Holgate was sent to the Tower then stripped of his post for breaking his vow of celibacy.\n\nHaving paid the crown \u00a31,000 for his \u2018crimes\u2019 Holgate was set free in January 1555 only to die that November in London."}, {"url": "https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/17223886.meet-archbishop-robert-holgate-founder-archbishop-holgates-school/", "page_content": "Robert Holgate and the restored Archbishop Holgate\u2019s Grammar School playing field gates\n\nLocation of plaque: on the restored gates in Bridge Lane, off Wigginton Road near York Hospital\n\nTHINGS are a little bit different now. But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk.

Holgate came to Northwestern University in 1893 as a mathematics professor. He served as Dean of the College of Liberal Arts for 17 years and two terms as acting president of the University.\n\n\n\nHolgate began his professional teaching career in 1874, teaching in the public school system of Ontario. Upon graduation from college in 1884, he became a mathematics master (instructor) at Albert College, Belleville, Ontario. He remained in this position until 1890 when he became a fellow at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. He received a Ph.D. from Clark University in 1893. He joined the Northwestern University faculty in 1893 as an instructor in the Mathematics Department. During the year, he became involved in the activities of the first International Congress of Mathematicians held in conjunction with the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1893. He also devoted considerable attention to the preparation of a series of Colloquium Lectures by Felix Klein held in Evanston following the Congress.\n\n\n\nIn 1894, after only one year at Northwestern, he was made a full professor. In 1897, he played an instrumental role in the formation of the Chicago section of the American Mathematical Society and served as Secretary from 1897 to 1905. In 1902, he was appointed Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, a position he held for the next seventeen years.\n\n\n\nIn 1904, following the resignation of President Edmund James, Holgate was appointed President Ad Interim of Northwestern University. He served in this capacity until the selection of Abram Harris as President in 1906. During his first two-year term as acting president, the Norman Harris Lecture Foundation was established, a department of education was added to the College of Liberal Arts, a training school for nurses was established, the geology, zoology, and romance language departments were enlarged, the athletic field on Central Street was opened, and the University was able to pay off a quarter-million-dollar debt. Additionally, he served as Secretary for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition held in St. Louis in 1904.\n\n\n\nBetween 1906 and 1916, Holgate held the Noyes Professorship of Pure Mathematics, secured legislation for revision and codification of the Illinois school laws, traveled to Rome where he was Secretary/Delegate to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1908, and was a member of a commission to reorganize the Chicago Public Library.\n\n\n\nIn 1916, with the resignation of Abram Harris, Holgate was once again called upon to serve as acting president of the University. As acting president from 1916 to 1919, Holgate instituted democratic reforms in the selection of deans; Northwestern was elected to membership in the Association of American Universities; the Law School's course of study was lengthened to four years; degree courses in physical education and public speaking were installed; student military training was established on campus; and 3,600 soldiers and sailors were trained in mechanical subjects as part of the University's commitment to the United States' war effort.\n\n\n\nDuring World War I, Holgate assisted Walter Dill Scott in personnel work for the War Department. He was also influential in the formation of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools and served as President from 1917 to 1918.\n\n\n\nIn 1919, with the selection of Lynn Harold Hough as President of the University, Holgate retired from his major administrative duties and was made Dean Emeritus of the College of Liberal Arts. He continued, however, to teach mathematics for the next fifteen years, retiring in 1934. He spent the 1921-,22 academic year in China as a visiting professor at the University of Nanking. His experiences in China served to reinforce an interest in foreign students and he acted as their advisor upon his return to Northwestern.\n\n\n\nHolgate's research interests were in the fields of pure geometry and ruled surfaces of the fourth order. His translation of Theodore Reye's Geometrie der Lage (Geometry of Position) was published in 1898. His other published works include Elementary Geometry (1901) and Projective Pure Geometry (1930). He also wrote a \u201cHistory of the Mathematics Department at Northwestern University, 1855-1905,\u201d and a thirty-page summary of Northwestern University's activities during World War I, \u201cNorthwestern in the Great War.\u201d\n\n\n\nHolgate received honorary Doctor of Law degrees from the University of Illinois in 1905, Queen's University in 1919, and Northwestern University in 1937. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a member of the University Club of Evanston, the University Club of Chicago, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi.\n\n\n\nIn addition to his university activities, Holgate was prominent in civic and religious affairs and was particularly concerned with administrative problems of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He served five terms as a member of the Methodist Church's General Conference; was a member of its Board of Education for Negroes; and from 1924 to his death in 1945, was a member of the church's Board of Education, serving as its treasurer from 1934 to 1938. From 1923 to 1925, he was president of the Chicago Church Federation. In recognition of his support of educational opportunities for black students, the library at Bennett College in North Carolina was named for him.\n\n\n\nDean Holgate was married twice. On August 2, 1885, in Bath, Ontario, Canada, he married Julia Caroline Sharp, the daughter of a local farmer, John Sharp. She died in 1887. His second marriage to Georgina Angela Burdette, the daughter of Daniel Burdette, a. manufacturer, took place in Newburgh, Ontario, Canada, July 23, 1890. The Holgates had four children: Eleanor, born in 1894, who later married the noted scholar, Owen Lattimore; Robert Burdette, born in 1895; Barbara (Mrs. George H. Young), born in 1899, and Frances Burdette, born in 1902.\n\n\n\nThomas Franklin Holgate died of a heart ailment in Evanston at the age of 86 on April 11, 1945. Funeral services were held on April 13, 1945 at the First Methodist Church of Evanston.\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that his formal title was that of President Ad Interim, Holgate was one of the most accomplished, significant, and influential administrators in Northwestern's history, and enjoyed an extraordinarily long and productive academic career, while maintaining an avid interest in foreign, civic and religious affairs.\n\nFound in 1 Collection or Record:"}, {"url": "https://wiki2.org/en/Robert_Holgate", "page_content": "What we do. Every page goes through several hundred of perfecting techniques; in live mode. Quite the same Wikipedia. Just better.\n\nEnglish Anglican bishop (died 1555)\n\nRobert Holgate (1481/1482 \u2013 1555) was Bishop of Llandaff from 1537 and then Archbishop of York (from 1545 to 1554). He recognised Henry VIII as head of the Church of England.\n\nAlthough a protege of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, Holgate had a career in the Gilbertine Order of which he became master. He was briefly Prior of Watton until the priory was dissolved in 1539. Most of the Gilbertine houses were lesser establishments which should have been dissolved under the Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535 (only four out of twenty-six houses had revenues over \u00a3200 a year). However, Holgate is credited with using his influence to save them for a few years. For example, Malton Priory, one of the lesser Gilbertine houses, was the last of them to surrender in December 1539,[1] whereas Sempringham Priory, worth more than \u00a3200 a year, surrendered in 1538.[2]\n\nHolgate was consecrated as Bishop of Llandaff on 25 March 1537. He translated to York on 16 January 1545. At York in 1546, he founded a school, now called Archbishop Holgate's School.\n\nHe was President of the Council of the North from 1538.[3]\n\nIn 1550 Holgate married Barbara Wentworth, who was about 25 at the time. This might, however have been a second wedding to make it fully legal, and Holgate and Wentworth might have first married in late 1547 with Roger Tongue officiating.[4] In 1551 Anthony Norman claimed that he was already married to Barbara Wentworth, but the courts decided that their marriage when she was about seven had not been a binding legal transaction. Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne. She imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married cleric being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist. In January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year.[5]\n\nIn 1558 a Robert Holgate from Yorkshire entered the University of Cambridge. He may have been a son of Holgate, since there are some claims he had two children by Barbara, but there is no conclusive evidence on the matter.\n\nYouTube Encyclopedic\n\n1 / 2 Views: 631 1 724\n\nMy Australia: Australian Parliament\n\nLiving, Studying and all things fun in Canberra from an International Students Perspective Transcription\n\nReferences\n\nThis article contains public domain text from William Page's Houses of the Gilbertine order: The priory of Sempringham, A History of the County of Lincoln: Volume 2 (1906)\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School\n\nH.L.

But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk. A new school, the Yeoman School, was built next door. Opened in 1846 this was intended to cater for the 'middle class children' of agriculturalists, as well as to provide teaching practice for student teachers at St John's.\n\nThe new school ran into financial difficulties, however, and in 1858, after 300 years in Ogleforth, Archbishop Holgate's School took it over.\n\nThe iron gates to the school's playing fields seem to have been designed between 1850 and 1860 by George Townsend Andrews, the architect who had designed St John's College itself. They were made by the Walmgate-based Walker Iron Foundry, which also made railings and gates for the British Museum, as well as others across York, including in St Leonard's Place, York Cemetery, Dean's Park and at St Peter's School.\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School thrived in its new location in Lord Mayor's Walk. By 1915, when the Rev William Johnson retired as headmaster, the school had 294 pupils.\n\nBy then, the school had leased part of Bootham Stray for playing fields, which is why the school playing field gates - which were restored in 2017 by York Civic Trust working with York Hospital - are there to this day.\n\nThe school itself moved to its present site on Hull Road in 1963.\n\nStephen Lewis\n\nFor the stories behind more York Civic Trust plaques, visit yorkcivictrust.co.uk"}, {"url": "https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F31981", "page_content": "This website uses cookies\n\nWe place some essential cookies on your device to make this website work.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to use additional cookies to remember your settings and understand how you use our services.\n\n\n\nThis information will help us make improvements to the website."}, {"url": "https://www.archbishopofyork.org/archbishop-york/previous-archbishops-york", "page_content": "Notable Archbishops\n\nLearn more about some of the previous Archbishops of York:\n\nLancelot Blackburne 1724-1743\n\nDuring the 1680's and following his ordination, Lancelot went to the West Indies and obtained a position as a ship's chaplain.

Robert Holgate held absolute political power in the North, running the King\u2019s Council in the North Parts from the King\u2019s Manor, raising armies to subdue the Scots, and operating with the authority of the King himself. In 1545, Henry VIII made him Archbishop of York, thereby complementing Holgate\u2019s political authority with the authority of one of the two leading roles in the Church of England, and cementing his position of absolute supremacy (second only to the King himself) in matters spiritual and temporal north of the Trent. Very soon after he was enthroned as Archbishop of York Holgate he founded a number of schools, ours included. Holgate took a close personal interest in the organisation of each school; his own signature lies at the bottom of each of the twenty-four pages of each of the three surviving copies of our school\u2019s Foundation Deed. Holgate then fell from grace politically, but remained Archbishop of York, a role he fulfilled vigorously until 1554.\n\nThe original school site, between Ogleforth and the City Walls, was on land in the shadow of York Minster owned by Holgate himself. Links between Church and School have remained strong. Indeed, the story of the school over more than four and a half centuries has been intertwined with the story of successive Archbishops of York. No school in the country has more distinguished links with the Church of England than ours, including successive Archbishops appointing Foundation Governors and themselves serving as Foundation Governors of the school. Archbishop Sentamu and the Dean of the Minster (along with the Bishop of Whitby) serve as Members of Pathfinder Trust (to which AHS belongs) and the Archbishop has also appointed one of our Foundation Governors to serve as a Lay Canon on Chapter, the Governing Body of York Minster.\n\nThere are only two hundred or so Church of England secondary schools in the country, four in the Diocese of York. The other three being Manor CE Academy, All Saints\u2019 VA School, Ingleby Barwick, Middlesborough, opened as new build in 2003; and Archbishop Sentamu, Hull, which became an Academy in 2008. Indeed in April 2011 both Archbishop\u2019s and Manor converted to Academy status and All Saints and Sentamu Academy have since followed. Both Manor (HOPE) and Sentamu (SALT) have formed Multi Academy Trusts and in September 2016 Archbishop Holgate\u2019s was one of the four founding schools of Pathfinder Multi Academy Trust. Our Christian foundation, which continues to remain at the heart of all we do as an Academy, as part of a Teaching School and as part of a Multi Academy Trust, gives the school an extra dimension, an additional facet, embedding our distinctiveness. Our Church status does not provide a context for evangelising; those committed to the Christian path will, on the other hand, find many ways in which their faith can find expression through the corporate values of the school."}, {"url": "http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/RobertHolgate.htm", "page_content": "Robert H OLGATE (Archbishop of York)\n\nDied: 15 Nov 1555\n\nBuried: Church of St. Sepulchre, Holborn, London\n\nEmerges from obscurity in 1537 as Bishop of Llandaff and Master of Semperingham, home of the Gilbertine Order, and of whom it was said, a great favourite at court.

Robert Holgate held absolute political power in the North, running the King\u2019s Council in the North Parts from the King\u2019s Manor, raising armies to subdue the Scots, and operating with the authority of the King himself. In 1545, Henry VIII made him Archbishop of York, thereby complementing Holgate\u2019s political authority with the authority of one of the two leading roles in the Church of England, and cementing his position of absolute supremacy (second only to the King himself) in matters spiritual and temporal north of the Trent. Very soon after he was enthroned as Archbishop of York Holgate he founded a number of schools, ours included. Holgate took a close personal interest in the organisation of each school; his own signature lies at the bottom of each of the twenty-four pages of each of the three surviving copies of our school\u2019s Foundation Deed. Holgate then fell from grace politically, but remained Archbishop of York, a role he fulfilled vigorously until 1554.\n\nThe original school site, between Ogleforth and the City Walls, was on land in the shadow of York Minster owned by Holgate himself. Links between Church and School have remained strong. Indeed, the story of the school over more than four and a half centuries has been intertwined with the story of successive Archbishops of York. No school in the country has more distinguished links with the Church of England than ours, including successive Archbishops appointing Foundation Governors and themselves serving as Foundation Governors of the school. Other Foundation Governors include a senior Canon Residentiary of York Minster, and a senior representative from York St John University.\n\nThere are only two hundred or so Church of England secondary schools in the country, four in the Diocese of York. The other three being Manor CE Academy, All Saints\u2019 VA School, Ingleby Barwick, Middlesborough, opened as new build in 2003; and Archbishop Sentamu, Hull, which became an Academy in 2008. Indeed in April 2011 both Archbishop\u2019s and Manor converted to Academy status and All Saints and Sentamu Academy have since followed. Both Manor (HOPE) and Sentamu (SALT) have formed Multi Academy Trusts and in September 2016 Archbishop Holgate\u2019s was one of the four founding schools of Pathfinder Multi Academy Trust. Our Christian foundation, which continues to remain at the heart of all we do as an Academy, as part of a Teaching School and as part of a Multi Academy Trust, gives the school an extra dimension, an additional facet, embedding our distinctiveness. Our Church status does not provide a context for evangelising; those committed to the Christian path will, on the other hand, find many ways in which their faith can find expression through the corporate values of the school."}, {"url": "https://maltonians.maltonschool.org/people/holgate.php", "page_content": "Illustrated here is the church at Darrington, near Pontefract.

But back in Tudor times it wasn't the done thing for a priest who had taken a vow of chastity to suddenly decide to get married.\n\nRobert Holgate wasn't just any priest: he was the Archbishop of York and President of the King's Council in the North. When he married in 1550, at the age of 68, it caused quite a scandal - particularly in conservative northern Church circles.\n\nHe got away with it during the reign of the young, and Protestant, King Edward VI, Henry VIII's son. But when Edward died at the age of 15 in 1553 and his Catholic sister Mary succeeded him, Robert quickly found himself in hot water.\n\nHe was imprisoned in the Tower of London for 'divers offences' - most notably getting married after having taken a vow of chastity.\n\nStripped of all his offices, he apologised to the Queen, and was eventually released in 1555 on payment of a huge fine. It did him little good - he died ten months later, clearly a broken man.\n\nRobert's career was typical of many statesmen in Tudor times. Like Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to dizzying heights, only to fall quickly from grace when he offended the ruling monarch.\n\nHis name survives in York, however, because of something he did while at the height of his power in York.\n\nHolgate had bought the Treasurer's House and other property in Minster Close.\n\nIn 1546, he founded three schools - one in York, one in Hemsworth, and one in Old Malton. The York school was in Ogleforth 'close by the cathedral' and, like other early grammar schools in England, was intended to train students for the church. The curriculum included Latin, Greek and Hebrew with some history, geography and maths but with the emphasis firmly on religious and moral education. Discipline is said to have been severe - as it was for poor Archbishop Robert himself once Queen Mary came to the throne.\n\nThe school survived the Archbishop's fall from grace, however. More than 200 years after his death, an advert in the York Courant in December 1799 stated that: \"The Free Grammar School situate within the Close of the Cathedral Church of York founded by Archbishop Holgate for the Instruction of Youth ... will open again after the Christmas recess on Monday, January 20, 1800.\"\n\nLike other grammar schools Archbishop Holgate's struggled for pupils in the early 1800s: it had just 10 in 1818, and 17 in 1824.\n\nThen, in 1845-6, the York Diocesan School Society built a new training college (St John's College) on Lord Mayor's Walk. A new school, the Yeoman School, was built next door. Opened in 1846 this was intended to cater for the 'middle class children' of agriculturalists, as well as to provide teaching practice for student teachers at St John's.\n\nThe new school ran into financial difficulties, however, and in 1858, after 300 years in Ogleforth, Archbishop Holgate's School took it over.\n\nThe iron gates to the school's playing fields seem to have been designed between 1850 and 1860 by George Townsend Andrews, the architect who had designed St John's College itself. They were made by the Walmgate-based Walker Iron Foundry, which also made railings and gates for the British Museum, as well as others across York, including in St Leonard's Place, York Cemetery, Dean's Park and at St Peter's School.\n\nArchbishop Holgate's School thrived in its new location in Lord Mayor's Walk. By 1915, when the Rev William Johnson retired as headmaster, the school had 294 pupils.\n\nBy then, the school had leased part of Bootham Stray for playing fields, which is why the school playing field gates - which were restored in 2017 by York Civic Trust working with York Hospital - are there to this day.\n\nThe school itself moved to its present site on Hull Road in 1963.\n\nStephen Lewis\n\nFor the stories behind more York Civic Trust plaques, visit yorkcivictrust.co.uk"}, {"url": "https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/c/F31981", "page_content": "This website uses cookies\n\nWe place some essential cookies on your device to make this website work.\n\n\n\nWe'd like to use additional cookies to remember your settings and understand how you use our services.\n\n\n\nThis information will help us make improvements to the website."}, {"url": "http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/RobertHolgate.htm", "page_content": "Robert H OLGATE (Archbishop of York)\n\nDied: 15 Nov 1555\n\nBuried: Church of St. Sepulchre, Holborn, London\n\nEmerges from obscurity in 1537 as Bishop of Llandaff and Master of Semperingham, home of the Gilbertine Order, and of whom it was said, a great favourite at court.
