{"The Lemonheads released their debut album, Hate Your Friends, in 1987. The album was a critical and commercial success, and the band went on to release several more albums over the next decade.": [{"url": "https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hate_Your_Friends", "page_content": "1987 studio album by The Lemonheads\n\nDear Wikiwand AI, let's keep it short by simply answering these key questions:\n\nCan you list the top facts and stats about Hate Your Friends?\n\nSummarize this article for a 10 years old"}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/aug/26/the-lemonheads-10-of-the-best", "page_content": "How did the Lemonheads get themselves so thoroughly written out of pop history? Sure, Evan Dando proved himself to be a drug-addled jerk of the first rank, but he\u2019s not alone in that; yes, their career tailed off, like so many other bands. But that can\u2019t be enough to explain why the Lemonheads are barely even a footnote these days, when in the early 1990s, they seemed like the group who could credibly bridge the gap between grunge and pop (\u201cbubblegrunge\u201d was one wag\u2019s description of their style). Maybe it\u2019s because Dando was a) seemingly independently wealthy, b) extremely good looking, and c) apparently not very interested in seeming tortured. Unfortunately, the Lemonheads\u2019 peak coincided with seeming tortured being the principal qualifying factor for alt-rock success, whereas Dando was more interested in the sun, with a sound that joined the dots between Gram Parsons, Belinda Carlisle and Kiss. But that peak was several years in coming: the Lemonheads had formed in 1986, and their debut album, 1987\u2019s Hate Your Friends, was a brittle, sometimes awkward punk-rock record whose main purpose was to remind you how good H\u00fcsker D\u00fc were \u2013 there were pointless punked-up covers (Amazing Grace) and unconvincing hardcore exercises (Rat Velvet). But amid the dross were moments where the Lemonheads showed there was something that might lift them beyond the indie ghetto. Chief among those was Dando\u2019s ballad Don\u2019t Tell Yourself. Though it had to be given a plodding drum pattern and fuzzed guitars to fit on the record, this song was obviously the work of someone who had the ability to move beyond the graffiti-covered toilet-circuit dressing room of the album\u2019s back cover. Dando\u2019s gift for the kind of melody that combines euphoria and melancholy was present and correct, with chord changes that are just unexpected enough to raise a smile rather than cause a start. But what would come next?\n\nHate Your Friends\u2019 successor, Creator, was a bit of a mess. Two utterly pointless covers, of Charles Manson and Kiss, competed with some underwritten originals (Clang Bang Clang, the best of them, would be re-recorded for the fourth Lemonheads album as Left for Dead). The band split in its wake, only reuniting because they were offered a European tour, with Dando \u2013 whose relationship with co-founder Ben Deily was barely existent \u2013 switching to drums. They cobbled together a third album, Lick, from earlier recordings and a handful of new songs, and it proved to be their breakthrough, thanks largely to a bruised and battered cover of Suzanne Vega\u2019s Luka. But rather than pick that, I\u2019ve gone for a Ben Deily song. Deily is the forgotten man of the Lemonheads, despite sharing singing and songwriting duties with Dando across the first few albums. He left after Lick, and the Lemonheads became Dando\u2019s personal fiefdom, but without Deily there wouldn\u2019t have been a Lemonheads for Dando to take over. He wasn\u2019t Dando\u2019s equal as a writer, and his voice had a harsh, querulous tone that was harder to take than his bandmate\u2019s, but sometimes he came good. Anyway, his best Lemonheads song had a chorus Dando would have been proud of, with a weary resignation that suggested that, given another album or two, he would have developed into a terrific songwriter. Let\u2019s remember that he was a Lemonhead, too.\n\nAfter Lick, Dando (from now on, the Lemonheads would pretty much be him plus whoever he fancied having in the band) found himself in possession of an unlikely major label contract, courtesy of Atlantic. The first fruits of the union came in the form of the Favourite Spanish Dishes EP, in June 1990, which was led by this cover of a song by Linda Ronstadt and the Stone Poneys. Dando has always had an ear for a cover version, able to select songs that fitted his melodic and lyrical sensibility perfectly, and Different Drum was perfect for him. You can still hear that the Lemonheads had been a punk group, once upon a time, in the squalls of guitar that introduce the bridge, but you can tell Dando\u2019s more interested in the lines that carry the melody, the countering of the riff rising upwards and lead line spiralling downwards.\n\nA month after Favourite Spanish Dishes came the album Lovey, which didn\u2019t include Different Drum, though it had gathered the Lemonheads a good bit of attention. Without the spikiness of Deily, Dando struck out in a new direction, upping the simplicity and sentiment (one of Lovey\u2019s best moments is a beautiful cover of Gram Parsons\u2019 Brass Buttons). On Stove, he later said, he found the voice that would dominate his writing on the next album \u2013 the one where he celebrates the quotidian and the mundane. For all the rush of the song \u2013 double-time snares and frantically strummed guitars \u2013 Dando is considering nothing more dramatic than removing his old stove from his kitchen, and his conversations with the fitter: \u201cHe walked back in, talked \u2019bout his boy at UVM / And we began to put the new stove in / But I miss my stove, she\u2019s all alone / Call it love, she\u2019s been replaced.\u201d\n\nBetween Lovey and its successor, 1992\u2019s It\u2019s a Shame About Ray, Dando went to spend time in Australia. Here, the instincts that had led him to write Stove were reinforced. He fell in with a group of musicians \u2013 bands such as Smudge and the Hummingbirds \u2013 whose approach was the same, and, besotted, he started incorporating them into the Lemonheads. Not merely inspired by them, he took members, songs, whatever took his fancy (there must be scores of people who think Dando wrote Divan and Into Your Arms, so perfectly did they fit with the way Dando was writing). Alison\u2019s Starting to Happen was about Smudge\u2019s drummer Alison Galloway. \u201cShe\u2019d taken ecstasy and she had started to come on to the drug and she was like, \u2018Whoah!\u2019 And I was thinking, \u2018Whoah! Alison\u2019s starting to happen\u2019. So I turned it into a sort of love song,\u201d Dando said in 1992. But it was more than that: Alison\u2019s Starting to Happen showcases Dando\u2019s profound gift: the title is perfect, the instrumentation and arrangement unfussy but utterly alluring, and Dando\u2019s melodic sense is simply unimpeachable. The way he changes key in the build to the final chorus as he sings \u201cShe\u2019s the puzzle piece behind the couch that made the sky complete\u201d is a thing of miniature wonder. Dando is one of the great melodists of guitar music of the past 30 years \u2013 they simply poured out of him, in the way they did out of Neil Finn of Crowded House.\n\nIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray is now seen as the highpoint of the band\u2019s career, an album of such brevity and perfection that it could not be improved. Put it on and every song, bar the throwaway cover of Frank Mills from the musical Hair, sounds like an old hit single. It\u2019s worth remembering that Atlantic weren\u2019t taking that view when it was delivered. Lovey had failed to scratch its way into the charts on either side of the Atlantic, and when its follow-up came to be released in summer 1992, the company didn\u2019t exactly put muscle behind it. In the UK, it was released straight to mid-price, pretty much the most damning thing a major could do to one of its bands. Then something odd happened. The group recorded a version of Mrs Robinson to accompany a video release of The Graduate, and Atlantic sneaked it out as a single. It became a hit. Ray was then re-released, with some added Simon and Garfunkel, and the Lemonheads were bona fide rock stars. The new track unbalanced the album, and paled in comparison with Dando\u2019s own songs, expecially this one, possibly the best he\u2019s ever written. Drugs and Dando would become an increasingly vexed issue in the very near future, but this song captures the beautiful of ennui of being young, free of responsibility and able to treat getting stoned as a way of passing the time: \u201cShe\u2019s in the phone booth now / I\u2019m looking in / There comes a smile on her face: / \u2018There\u2019s still some of the same stuff we got yesterday.\u2019\u201d But there were hints of darkness in there, too, as Dando worries that \u201cI\u2019m too much by myself / I wanna be someone else\u201d. Musically, it\u2019s a long, blissful sigh of delight: slow and fragrant, lifted by an organ line that sounds like its wandering off on its own conversational thread.\n\nTheir sixth album, Come On Feel the Lemonheads, was meant to be the big one, and it reached No 5 in the UK charts. But to follow up a perfect miniature, Dando put together a sprawling album that was often self-indulgent and messy (Rick James Style, The Jello Fund), which perhaps reflected his increasing use of ever-harder drugs. The band\u2019s shows became sloppy and lackadaisical, and Dando became as well known for following Oasis around, off his face, as for his own music. But Come On \u2026 was also home to some of his best, sharpest writing \u2013 fabulous sunny powerpop (The Great Big No, Down About It) and beautiful ballads (Paid to Smile, Favorite T, Big Gay Heart) sat alongside each other, never rubbing each other up the wrong way. I\u2019ll Do It Anyway was written with Belinda Carlisle in mind \u2013 at that time the reigning queen of big California pop \u2013 and it sounds like it\u2019s just awaiting some preposterous additional production touches to send it to the top of the charts worldwide. But it\u2019s better for being left as it is, surprisingly tough instrumentally, with guitars fuzzed and choppy. As with all the best powerpop, though, the verses serve principally as a delivery vehicle to get you to the chorus via the most efficient route possible. And if the lyrics aren\u2019t up to much, who cares when the final line, delivered as if it\u2019s the final word on relationships, is: \u201cI\u2019m still a girl, and it\u2019s just a horse, and I got the reins.\u201d\n\nThe Lemonheads\u2019 biggest UK hit was another product of Dando\u2019s Australian infatuation. It had originally been recorded in 1990 by Love Positions, the project of the Hummingbirds\u2019 Robyn St Clare (who wrote it) and Nic Dalton (who was the Lemonheads\u2019 bassist for Come On \u2026, and co-founded the terrific Australian indie label Half a Cow), but you\u2019d never guess it wasn\u2019t a Dando original. The lyric, open-hearted and yearning (\u201cI know a place that\u2019s safe and warm from the crowd / Into your arms, into your arms, I can go\u201d) is lovely in its simplicity. Dando turns the skeletal original, which is less a song than the outline of one, into something of beauty, using the two chords as the base from which to soar off into a brief, psychedelic country guitar solo. Nearly doubling the song\u2019s original length only takes it up to just short of three minutes, but every second feels absolutely crucial.\n\nIn 1995, you\u2019d have bet against Dando ever recording anything worthwhile again. As Ted Kessler\u2019s NME review of their seventh album, Car Button Cloth, in 1996 recalled: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to credit, for instance, the scene a year ago in which Evan Dando is standing handcuffed, tripping on acid, and bleeding in Sydney airport, insisting the police release him so he can retrace his steps around the globe to find his mind. He\u2019d lost it on the way in, you see, and knew it was still out there somewhere.\u201d Yet the album was the work of a man whose gifts simply could not be killed, no matter how hard he tried. If I Could Talk I\u2019d Tell You is a song that\u2019s like the sweets the group took their name from: sweet and bright on the surface, but sour in the middle. Its lyric is drugged confusion \u2013 \u201cHold off, are we going soft / Flushed my Zoloft and we\u2019re comin\u2019 around again\u201d \u2013 and Kessler suggested the chorus (\u201cIf I could talk I\u2019d tell you / If I could smile I\u2019d let you know\u201d) came from an incident when Dando found himself unable to communicate during an interview because of the amount of crack he\u2019d smoked.\n\nThere were two further albums \u2013 a perfectly pleasant self-titled record in 2006 that never quite reached the heights of the first run of records, and a covers album, Varshons, in 2009 \u2013 but Car Button Cloth marked the end of the Lemonheads as a purposeful, current band. So it\u2019s one more track from that to round off the list, one that highlights the Lemonheads\u2019 maudlin, self-deprecating wit \u2013 though the lyrics come from Tom Morgan of Smudge, who\u2019d collaborated with Dando since It\u2019s a Shame About Ray. Over a loping country-rock backing, Dando admits to a girl he\u2019s been courting that he lied about some stuff in order to make himself more attractive: \u201cI can\u2019t go away with you on a rock-climbing weekend / What if something\u2019s on TV and it\u2019s never shown again / It\u2019s just as well I\u2019m not invited, I\u2019m afraid of heights / I lied about being the outdoor type.\u201d The irony being that if you were to pick one early-90s alt-rock type whom you could imagine climbing, snowboarding, windsurfing, mountain biking, it would be the tanned, tall, muscular Dando, the man they called \u201calternahunk\u201d. We\u2019ll never know what caused the great dichotomy in Dando\u2019s character: the man who could sing this sweet, melancholy, empathic song could also reveal himself to be an overprivileged, arrogant dick in interviews. So we\u2019re left with Berry Gordy\u2019s maxim: it\u2019s what\u2019s in the grooves that counts."}, {"url": "https://thelemonheadsmusic.bandcamp.com/album/hate-your-friends-deluxe", "page_content": "Digital Album Streaming + Download Includes unlimited streaming via the free Bandcamp app, plus high-quality download in MP3, FLAC and more.

Together, these seminal albums showcase the band's early punk rock roots-and trace the Lemonheads' transformation towards becoming one of the most successful and influential bands in indie rock.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore the 90s. Before the internet. Before Nevermind. Back when something called \"independent music\" first began reaching a wider audience, through college radio, word-of-mouth, and that small \"underground\" record store you seem to find in every town...there was a band from Boston called Lemonheads.\n\n\n\nHigh school friends Ben Deily and Evan Dando, Lemonheads' primary songwriters, co-guitarists and co-vocalists, first recorded together on 4-track cassette in the spring of 1985; by the end of the decade they - together with bass player Jesse Peretz, sometimes-guitarist Corey Brennan, and successive drummers Doug Trachten and John P. Strohm - had created a body of recordings which would see them on MTV's fledgling \"120 Minutes,\" beating out the Grateful Dead on college radio charts, and entering the consciousness of a generation of music fans.\n\n\n\nCited as influences by artists as varied as Billie Joe Armstrong and Ryan Adams, these fledgling Lemonheads recordings-part rock, part pop, part unique hybrid of the 80s punk styles beloved by the band members-mark the start of the trajectory that would eventually lead to \"mainstream\" success and stardom for a later version of the band. But they also represent a distinct, never-repeated phase of the band's history: one that is finally receiving the attention it deserves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe roots of Hate Your Friends begin with the genesis of the band itself. Dando and Deily first started out as a two-piece ensemble: swapping back and forth between a shared Guild guitar (and a crappy amp) and vocal mic, and pounding a drum kit \"borrowed\" from the high school jazz band. With the addition of Jesse Peretz on bass, the two-man outfit quickly became a power trio.\n\n\n\nWith a handful of original songs, a passionate love for their favourite bands-from Husker-Du, the Replacements, Black Flag and the Germs, to the Saints, Wire and '77 UK punk-and a tiny recording budget, the Lemonheads set about their first studio session within days of their high school graduation in June of 1986.\n\n\n\nDuring that summer, a significant amount of what would become the band's debut album was recorded in Brookline, Massachusetts, with Deily and Dando sharing vocal, guitar and drumming duties. Above and beyond bass, Jesse proved pivotal as the band's manager, booker and tireless promoter-helping arrange for the Lemonheads self-released debut EP, Laughing all the way to the cleaners, later that summer, and shortly thereafter helping establish the relationship with Curtis Casella of TAANG! records that paved the way to full-length LP Hate Your Friends.\n\n\n\nFinally, with the addition of full-time (and fairly short-lived) drummer Doug Trachten, the last songs of Hate Your Friends were recorded in the winter of 1986-7.\n\n\n\nBONUS TRACKS:\n\n\n\nThis Fire Records re-issue features bonus tracks including 12 never-before-released live tracks from a 1987 radio session, rare tracks from the early compilation Crawling From Within, and additional tracks not included on the original release of Hate Your Friends (\"Buried Alive\" and \"Gotta Stop\").\n\ncredits\n\nreleased October 7, 2013\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}, {"url": "https://www.discogs.com/release/2688477-Lemonheads-Hate-Your-Friends", "page_content": "taangrecords May 20, 2018 Report\n\nThis listing is incorrect ,\n\nThere was never a CANADA issue of Hate Your Friends only the jacket was printed there at Ross Ellis"}, {"url": "https://www.banquetrecords.com/the-lemonheads/hate-your-friends-%28deluxe%29/FIRELP235?open=menu", "page_content": "You will need to log in or register to be notified\n\nExpected 7th October\n\n\n\nDeluxe reissue of The Lemonheads' 1987 debut album featuring 12 unreleased live tracks from a 1987 radio session, rare tracks from the early compilation Crawling From Within, and extra tracks Buried Alive and Gotta Stop not included on the original release\n\nWith a handful of original songs, a passionate love for their favourite bands and a tiny recording budget, the Lemonheads set about their first studio session within days of their high school graduation in1986.

Strohmhad created a body of recordings which would see them on MTVs fledgling 120 Minutes, beating out the Grateful Dead on college radio charts, and entering the consciousness of a generation of music fans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLick is the third full-length album and the last to feature founding member Ben Deily. It was also the group's last independent label-released album before signing to major label Atlantic.\n\n\n\nAn odd mixture of brand-new, and considerably older, sounds, 1989s Lick brings together the output of several distinct recording sources: six brand new songs recorded with Minneapolis-based band friend and producer Terry Katzman, and a collection of older, B-side and never-released material originally overseen by producer and engineer Tom Hamilton.\n\n\n\nThe difficulties of writing and creating a new full-length album every year (Hate Your Friends and Creator were released in 1987 and 1988, respectively) are clearly in evidence on Lick. While the newest material (Mallo Cup, A Circle of One, 7 Powers, Anyway) hints at promising new song writing directions for both Deily and Dando, there's an almost valedictory sense of the past in the inclusion of versions of Glad I Don't Know and I Am a Rabbit (from the bands' first-ever, self-released EP), and the now-classic track 'Ever', a previously-unreleased tune from the original 1986 'Hate Your Friends' sessions. At moments, Lick almost sounds like an elegy for itself or an elegy for a band that has reached the end of the beginning.\n\n\n\nAlso audible in the heterogeneous songs are the tensions of line-up changes and inchoate, growing frustrations. After various band break-ups or threatened break ups (such as Dando's brief departure to play bass for Boston band the Blake Babies), the Lemonheads convened to record new material for Lick now featured Dando on drums, Peretz on bass, Deily on guitar (and piano, according to the album credits) along with the addition of long-time band friend and former member of TAANG! Label mates Bullet LaVolta, Corey Loog Brennan on lead guitar. And yet the frenzied, quasi-ironic hammer-ons of Corey's axe provide some of Licks most entertaining moments like the unaccountably-translated-into-Italian paen to 70s detective Ironside, Cazzo Di Ferro. (The songs music was originally composed by Brennan for his Italian punk band, Superfetazione.)\n\n\n\nAfter the albums completion, Deily opted out of the subsequent European tour, before leaving the band permanently. Jesse Peretz stayed on to record their Atlantic records debut Lovey, but left after the supporting tour in '91. Since then, Dando has been the Lemonheads' sole permanent member\n\n.\n\nBONUS TRACKS:\n\n\n\nThis Fire Records re-issue features bonus tracks including several never-before-released live tracks from a 1987 radio session, live tracks and an interview from the 1989 European tour, and the 4 tracks of the Lemonheads self-released debut EP, Laughing all the way to the cleaners.\n\ncredits\n\nreleased October 7, 2013\n\nlicense\n\nall rights reserved"}, {"url": "https://louderthanwar.com/the-lemonheads-hate-your-friends-creator-lick-albums-review/", "page_content": "Share This Tweet\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nThe Lemonheads: Hate Your Friends, Creator & Lick (Fire Records)\n\nCD/LP/DL\n\nDue Out 7th Oct\n\nFire Records are reissuing the first three albums by Lemonheads.

Of course, if you don\u2019t already own these albums which not many people do to be honest, at least comparatively to their Atlantic Records releases such as, \u2018It\u2019s A Shame About Ray\u2019 and \u2018Come On, Feel The Lemonheads\u2019, they are worth buying. They contain more songs from the live radio sessions than the \u201992 release, with a welcome additions such as a cover of Charles Manson\u2019s version of the song he wrote for The Beach Boys, \u2018Cease To Exist\u2019. Their penchant for quirky cover versions goes back as far as these formative albums, with them covering \u2018Amazing Grace\u2019, \u2018Plaster Caster\u2019 by Kiss, Their break through single, Susan Vega\u2019s \u2018Luka\u2019 & Dando\u2019s version of \u2018Home Is Where Your Happy\u2019 by Manson again. In fact their (or Dando\u2019s) obsession with Manson extends itself throughout the their early career. Firstly with another cover of, \u2018Clang Bang Clang\u2019 on \u2018Lick\u2019, and secondly the many songs that allude to or blatantly sample Manson directly such as, \u2018Die Right Now\u2019, \u2018Come Back DA\u2019 and my favorite tune on \u2018Hate Your Friends\u2019, \u2018Sneakyville\u2019. Even continuing on their major label debut, \u2018Lovey\u2019 with the beautiful, \u2018Ride With Me\u2019, the smokey \u2018Lil Seed\u2019 and chaotic \u2018Ballerat\u2019.\n\nWhat seems to be evolving over the period of these three albums is the duelling of the songwriters, which in a lot of cases makes for better songs but inversely, the power struggle can also dissolve relationships between its vying band members. Their debut, \u2018Hate Your Friends\u2019 is the sound of East coast, teenage punk rock co-existing with their pop influences if only for a few fleeting minutes. Most of the album is made up of fast, overdriven shouty and nihilistic exuberance. Their irreverent cover of Proud Scum\u2019s, \u2018Rabbit\u2019 never fails to raise a smile as they scream about wanting to, \u201cshare their carrot with you\u201d. The best tracks are the title track, \u2018Hate Your Friends\u2019 and the Buzzcocks sounding, \u2018Second Chance\u2019 with the radio session versions of the giving a glimpse of their live sound.\n\nTheir follow up album, \u2018Creator\u2019 finds them leaning closer to REM than Negative FX. The laconic, \u2018Out\u2019 sounds as if Dinosaur Jr had started influencing the East coast sound. Overall it isn\u2019t as vibrant as their debut writing more of a sub-Replacements Indie Pop Punk. The songs seem unfinished and demo-like. Stand out track is the catchy, upbeat Deily penned, \u2018Take Her Down\u2019 and the extra radio session versions sound better than some on the album but add little to the underwhelming nature of the album in large.\n\n\u2018Lick\u2019 on the other hand is where The Lemonheads find their stride and really deliver some great melodic hooks and evocative lyrics. The opening track, \u2018Mallo Cup\u2019 is playful and well performed. They squeeze as much melody from it\u2019s chords making it one of their best songs thus far. Their \u2018Punkiness\u2019 has definitely been replaced by \u2018Rockiness\u2019 on this album making it far more palatable. On \u20187 Powers\u2019 and \u2018Ever\u2019, Deily again proves to be on point lyrically creating some very poignant songs but it\u2019s Dando that pulls out the Indie Pop trump card with, \u2018Circle Of One\u2019. A jangly slice of what he will become famous for. Again, the radio session versions offer little but the addition of the B sides to the \u2018Luka\u2019 EP, \u2018Fucked Up\u2019 and \u2018I Like To\u2019 are a pleasure because of their superior production.\n\nRecommended if you don\u2019t already own the \u201992 re-issue.\n\n~\n\nThe Lemonheads can be found at their website and at their Facebook, Twitter and MySpace pages.\n\nAll words by Philip Allen.

The album featured the singer and guitarist Evan Dando, the bassist Juliana Hatfield, and the drummer David Ryan. Five months earlier, Nirvana\u2019s \u201cNevermind\u201d had landed at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and so-called \u201calternative rock,\u201d as it was then known, was reaching a commercial zenith. I first learned about the Lemonheads through that most potent nineties triad: the group had been featured in Sassy magazine\u2019s \u201cCute Band Alert,\u201d it had a video in heavy rotation on \u201c120 Minutes,\u201d MTV\u2019s late-night dumping ground for stuff too weird or grating for prime time, and Dando had scored a cameo in the film \u201cReality Bites,\u201d in which he coolly ended a conversation by saying, \u201cI\u2019m Audi 5000.\u201d\n\nThe Lemonheads were getting big. Dando, the band\u2019s chief songwriter, had even appeared on \u201cRegis and Kathie Lee\u201d to promote the album. \u201cThis is a young, giant star,\u201d Regis Philbin announced. Dando ambled onstage, wearing a tan secondhand jacket. \u201cThis is in,\u201d Regis said, fingering the threadbare lining and nodding. \u201cSee, I\u2019m out, I\u2019m just totally out.\u201d At one point, Dando described his mother, who was sitting in the audience, as \u201ccool bananas,\u201d which intrigued Regis. \u201cIt just means cool bananas,\u201d Dando explained. (Was anyone ever so young?)\n\nThis month, \u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray\u201d is being reissued with bonus material, including B-sides, demos, and radio sessions, and in April the Lemonheads will be performing these songs at a handful of tour dates. In the thirty years since its release, I have come to think of \u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray\u201d as a perfect album. Certainly, there are records more sophisticated, more dangerous, or more expert, yet there are few so exquisitely self-contained. Dando\u2019s songs are saturated with a kind of directionless longing\u2014a troubling, inescapable sense that there\u2019s more out there for him. Often, his protagonists are walking around waiting for something interesting to happen. For most writers, it\u2019s extraordinarily difficult to catch and hold feelings of pathos, idleness, hunger, a kind of hazy but manageable melancholy. Dando\u2019s songs are short (many are under or around two minutes), with choruses and hooks so easygoing, so suffused with nonchalance, that it feels as though they must have arrived fully formed and without struggle.\n\nDando, who is now in his mid-fifties, is hunky in a dopey-yet-strapping, I-rolled-off-the-couch-like-this way; in the nineties, he became an alt-rock pinup, appearing on the April, 1993, cover of Spin shirtless and golden-skinned, and with his tongue in the model Adrienne Shelly\u2019s mouth. In a 1994 profile of Chlo\u00eb Sevigny for this magazine, Jay McInerney described the Lemonheads as \u201cconsidered either very cool or really bogus\u201d and referred to the creation of an anti-Dando fanzine called Die Evan Dando, Die, thus named \u201cpresumably because he is too cute and his songs are too catchy.\u201d (Sevigny, who is featured in the video for \u201cBig Gay Heart,\u201d a track from the album \u201cCome On Feel the Lemonheads,\u201d is one of several celebrities to appear in the band\u2019s videos: a forlorn Johnny Depp stuffs his belongings into a grocery bag and takes off in the video for \u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray\u201d; Angelina Jolie makes out with Dando as his defeated girlfriend looks on in \u201cIt\u2019s About Time.\u201d)\n\nDando was brought up in Back Bay, a historic and moneyed neighborhood in Boston. His mother was a model, and his father worked as a real-estate attorney. As a teen-ager, Dando attended the private Commonwealth School, where, in 1985, he started a band called the Whelps, which later evolved into the Lemonheads. The inaugural lineup included the bassist Jesse Peretz (who went on to direct films and television shows) and the singer and guitarist Ben Deily. The trio\u2019s first record, \u201cHate Your Friends,\u201d was released on the Boston-based independent label Taang! Records (an acronym for \u201cTeen agers are no good\u201d), which specialized in local punk and hardcore. \u201cHate Your Friends\u201d may sound jarring and cacophonous to anyone chiefly familiar with the band\u2019s sweeter, late-career output, but nonetheless it\u2019s tuneful and energetic. The Lemonheads signed with Atlantic Records and released \u201cLovey\u201d in 1990. Since then, the band has had more than forty members. Dando once described it as \u201ckind of like a collective.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray\u201d eventually went gold, yet for a while it seemed as though Dando himself might not survive the decade. In 1995, the band was scheduled to play at the Glastonbury Festival, in England; Dando arrived two hours late and was booed off the stage. (He later told the Guardian that he had been in bed with two women and a bag of heroin.) He admitted that he had smoked crack and damaged his vocal cords during the sessions for \u201cCome On Feel the Lemonheads,\u201d telling Q magazine, \u201cI went to the throat doctor and I told him I\u2019d been smoking crack and he said, \u2018Don\u2019t do that, man. That\u2019s dangerous.\u2019 \u201d After that, rumors that he was dead would periodically circulate, but Dando ended up outlasting many of his contemporaries.\n\nThe Lemonheads have not released new material since \u201cThe Lemonheads,\u201d in 2006. (That lineup included the bassist Karl Alvarez and the drummer Bill Stevenson, both members of the punk-rock band the Descendents, with contributions from Garth Hudson, the organist for the Band, and the singer and guitarist J. Mascis, of Dinosaur Jr.) In 2009, the Lemonheads released a covers record called \u201cVarshons.\u201d On it, Dando takes on Townes Van Zandt\u2019s \u201cWaiting Around to Die.\u201d Unlike Van Zandt, who sounds heartsick, frayed, and desperate, Dando gives a performance that is practically jaunty. That album was followed, nearly a decade later, by \u201cVarshons II.\u201d In the years since, Dando has been promising to release new songs, but they have yet to materialize.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray\u201d was recorded at Cherokee Studios, in Los Angeles, and produced, at Atlantic\u2019s suggestion, by the Robb Brothers. In the nineteen-sixties, the Robbs (Dee, Bruce, Joe, and Craig) had briefly served as the backing band on \u201cWhere the Action Is,\u201d a variety show hosted by Dick Clark, but by the early seventies Bruce, Dee, and Joe had become more focussed on production. They opened Cherokee in 1972, and during the following decade worked on a series of remarkable records, including Steely Dan\u2019s \u201cPretzel Logic,\u201d David Bowie\u2019s \u201cStation to Station,\u201d and Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cOff the Wall.\u201d\n\nThe Robbs recruited some unexpected players for the \u201cRay\u201d sessions, including Jeff (Skunk) Baxter, a guitarist turned defense consultant who had been a founding member of Steely Dan and a guitarist with the Doobie Brothers. It is almost impossible to imagine a band less germane to the dishevelled alt-rock vibe than Steely Dan, yet Baxter\u2019s pedal-steel parts on \u201cHannah and Gabi\u201d\u2014a pretty, fragile song about being a terrible partner (\u201cI\u2019m out wandering around / You\u2019re but one thing I\u2019ve found\u201d)\u2014are warm and rubbery, giving the song a lilt that recalls Gram Parsons. The acoustic demo included on the reissued record, which features only Dando on vocals and acoustic guitar, is listless by comparison.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray\u201d is the only album by the Lemonheads to feature Hatfield, who is a dynamic and beguiling artist on her own; her soft, almost childlike vocals on \u201cMy Drug Buddy,\u201d a loping, breezy ode to the person you call when you want to get high but don\u2019t want to be alone, give a potentially devastating track an unexpected airiness. In fact, much of \u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray\u201d should be devastating\u2014these are songs about being young and lost, \u201clike a ship without a rudder\u2019s like a ship without a rudder\u2019s like a ship without a rudder,\u201d as Dando puts it\u2014but isn\u2019t. Since that record\u2019s release, Dando has remained spacey and carefree despite the nihilism that plagued his Generation X cohort. He never wanted to be a pop star. At times, it has seemed as though he barely wanted to be a professional musician. The reissue of \u201cIt\u2019s a Shame About Ray\u201d closes with an echoing, acoustic demo of \u201cConfetti,\u201d a song that addresses being the less interested party in a romantic entanglement. It\u2019s a minute and fifteen seconds long. Dando doesn\u2019t need much time to say his piece: \u201cHe kinda shoulda sorta woulda loved her if he could\u2019ve / He\u2019d rather be alone than pretend.\u201d \u2666"}]}
