That may seem like a drastic stance given the debate over censorship and free speech that has accompanied these types of purges. But it\u2019s one that signifies just how notorious the book has become, and how much real-world damage it\u2019s arguably caused.\n\nWritten and self-published by a racist man who founded a dangerous white supremacist organization, The Turner Diaries has long been viewed as a fundamental manual of extremism. While other more well-known cultural artifacts like The Catcher in the Rye (a favorite of presidential and other assassins) or The Anarchist Cookbook (a well-known \u201cmurder manual\u201d for terrorists, mass shooters, and other extremists) have captured the public consciousness as bait for potentially violent, disaffected loners, The Turner Diaries has been little-known for decades outside of extremist circles. But within those extremist circles, it became well-established as a core text due to its use as, essentially, a training manual for America\u2019s largest neo-Nazi organization \u2014 and then the internet made it more accessible than ever.\n\nAlthough The Turner Diaries is fiction, its narrative mirrors recent real-world events, probably because many modern-day extremists have been so influenced by it. We can see that influence in the most direct and chilling way \u2014 because, among other things, The Turner Diaries ends with a violent terrorist coup against the US government, not unlike the January 6 Capitol insurrection. But while The Turner Diaries is foundational to modern white supremacy\u2019s terrorist tactics, it may have shaped the ideology even more \u2014 and that\u2019s an influence that will be harder to remove than the book itself.\n\nThe Turner Diaries was written by an avowed neo-Nazi\n\nThe Turner Diaries was first published in its entirety in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The real author was William Luther Pierce \u2014 a racist man the hate-watch group Southern Poverty Law Center dubbed \u201cAmerica\u2019s most important Nazi\u201d of the 20th century. It would be hard to overstate Pierce\u2019s galling contributions to the cause of US white supremacy \u2014 and that\u2019s without considering The Turner Diaries.\n\nBorn in Atlanta in 1933 and raised in Virginia and Alabama, Pierce reportedly claimed to be descended from a Civil War governor, and attended a military high school in Texas before going on to attain a doctorate in physics. According to an offensively obsequious 2001 biography of Pierce \u2014 in which author Robert Griffin extensively quotes Pierce spouting unchallenged white supremacist propaganda \u2014 Pierce was raised for part of his childhood by a relative who had a Black person who\u2019d been convicted of a crime working for him who \u201cin effect was his slave.\u201d Racism was a consistent part of Pierce\u2019s upbringing and his political pursuits, and he eventually left a career as a rocket scientist in 1966 to invest more deeply in American Naziism.\n\nHe first joined the American Nazi Party, then gradually latched onto a different group created in support of segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace and his 1968 presidential election campaign. Pierce evolved that organization into what ultimately became, in 1974, a group called the National Alliance. The group grew rapidly and gained influence at home and abroad, as Pierce preached dire warnings about how a rise in diversity and the societal changes of the civil rights movement would bring about \u201cthe end of white America.\u201d\n\nThrough the National Alliance, Pierce ran his own underground media empire, including a newspaper, a book press, a radio station, and an extremist record distributor \u2014 all to broadcast his message of violent white nationalism. His efforts worked. In a report published in 1998, the Anti-Defamation League noted, \u201cWith 16 active cells from coast to coast, an estimated membership of 1,000 and several thousand additional Americans listening to its radio broadcasts and browsing its Internet site, the National Alliance is the largest and most active neo-Nazi organization in the nation.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s goals, the ADL reported, were to establish \u201ca racially clean area of the earth\u201d and to \u201cdo whatever is necessary to achieve this White living space and to keep it White.\u201d\n\nGriffin\u2019s biography reveals Pierce to be a man isolated by his own heinous ideas. Late in his life, he was estranged from both of his sons and was living in rural West Virginia with a lonely young wife with whom it seemed he could barely communicate. She was the latest in a string of Eastern European wives, all of whom he\u2019d chosen based on his belief that Eastern European women were more subservient to men than American women. At the time of his death in 2001, he was reportedly living alone.\n\nBut Pierce\u2019s impact on the national political landscape was far more lasting than his personal relationships.\n\nThe Turner Diaries became exactly what it was intended to be \u2014 a manual for violence\n\nThe Turner Diaries began as a fictional adventure series that Pierce published in the National Alliance newspaper, Attack, starting in 1975. A dystopian novel set in a future version of America, it follows the journal entries of a man named Earl Turner as he turns to increasing violence in his resistance to the US government as part of a group called the Organization.\n\nIn Pierce\u2019s scenario, Turner is fighting an orgiastic ultraconservative fantasy of an unchecked liberal future: The government confiscates all guns from private citizens and pursues resistors using a force called \u201cthe Equality Police.\u201d The media and Hollywood operate as untrustworthy left-wing propaganda, while racial and ethnic minorities gain power and enact anti-white laws. The back cover of the book asks readers, \u201cWhat will you do when they come to take your guns?\u201d\n\nThe book contains lurid, graphic violence carried out against liberals, government officials, members of the media, and Black and Jewish citizens. It gleefully urges white militias to rise up and engage in guerrilla warfare against the oppressive government \u2014 think the \u201980s action movie Red Dawn, in which Russia invades the US and small-town civilians fight back with renegade tactics, but with more racism and bloodlust. Among other things, the book features car bombings, suicide missions, and one scene in which white supremacist terrorists hang politicians en masse \u2014 a scene that some experts felt had echoes in the Capitol insurrection, during which a gallows was erected amid calls to hang certain elected officials.\n\nThe book chillingly culminates in Turner planning to fly a plane into the Pentagon in a suicide bombing mission \u2014 an act the narrative tells us ushered in a \u201cNew Era\u201d of white supremacist rule and made Turner a national folk hero to the subsequent Aryan civilization.\n\nBy all accounts, Pierce intended the book to be influential, more than just a work of fiction, and it was. In many chapters of the National Alliance, the book was required reading and was essentially presented to new members as an instruction manual. Pierce also intended it to glorify violence against nonwhites and progressives. The ADL report quoted a 1997 radio broadcast in which Pierce said:\n\nIn 1975, when I began writing The Turner Diaries ... I wanted to take all of the feminist agitators and propagandists and all of the race-mixing fanatics and all of the media bosses and all of the bureaucrats and politicians who were collaborating with them, and I wanted to put them up against a wall, in batches of a thousand or so at a time, and machine-gun them. And I still want to do that.\n\nAfter its serial publication, Pierce published The Turner Diaries in novel form in 1978 through his own independent press, after which it circulated underground for over a decade, known mainly only to white nationalists, extremists, and the people who kept a close watch on them. By the late 1980s, an advertisement for the book had appeared in the extremist survivalist magazine Soldier of Fortune, making it available via mail order. That\u2019s how it ended up in the hands of an Army recruit named Timothy McVeigh.\n\nLater, at McVeigh\u2019s trial for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing \u2014 the worst terrorist attack on US soil prior to 9/11 \u2014 McVeigh\u2019s fellow soldiers would testify that he was obsessed with the book and pored over it constantly. He sold copies of the book at gun shows, and mailed others to friends and family urging them to read it.\n\nOne of them did read it, and later recognized McVeigh\u2019s attack on the Oklahoma City federal building as drawing straight from The Turner Diaries\u2019 terrorist template. When authorities arrested McVeigh, they found excerpts from the book in his car.\n\nMcVeigh\u2019s terrorism is the most famous, but it\u2019s far from the only Turner Diaries-influenced act of extremism or racist violence. These range from lone individual hate crimes to at least one mass assault to numerous crime rings.\n\nOne group of domestic terrorists operating in the \u201980s called itself \u201cthe Order\u201d after one of the fictional militias in the book, which they referred to as a bible. Their ringleaders were former members of Pierce\u2019s National Alliance, and they allegedly hoped their acts of violence might help usher in the dystopian uprising fictionalized in The Turner Diaries.\n\nIn 1998, another group of National Alliance members planned to detonate 14 bombs across the city of Orlando, including one at the entrance to Walt Disney World; they failed when one of the would-be bombers accidentally set off one of the bombs as he was building it. The Southern Poverty Law Center cites at least 14 terrorist acts linked to the National Alliance between 1983 and 2005.\n\nMuch of this activity, crucially, took place before the internet, which of course made it possible for The Turner Diaries to spread and gain more influence \u2014 even beyond the scope of terrorist acts it influenced.\n\nThe novel\u2019s biggest impact on far-right politics may have been philosophical\n\nExtremist expert J.M. Berger has argued that even beyond its practical instruction in violent tactics, The Turner Diaries was directly responsible for a profound shift in extremist right-wing ideas \u2014 particularly regarding the way Pierce\u2019s National Alliance, and later the neo-Nazi movement more generally, recruited new members. Through his organization and then through the book, Pierce broadened neo-Nazi messaging by emphasizing emotional rhetoric rather than drilling down into specific, potentially alienating philosophical debates.\n\nBerger wrote in the Atlantic in 2016 that through Pierce\u2019s influence, \u201cprominent white nationalists began to take a more carefully generic approach, playing on racial fear and resentment as they existed, rather than attempting to manufacture doctrinaire justifications.\u201d\n\nIn many respects, Berger argued, The Turner Diaries presaged the amorphous, slippery character of the modern alt-right, with its various loosely allied groups all united under one general commitment to the theme of white nationalism. \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d he wrote, \u201cdemonstrated how to successfully leverage racial fears and resentments in the service of violence, without a call to a specific ideology.\u201d\n\nNot only that, but The Turner Diaries\u2019 rhetorical emphasis, the constant drumbeat of its themes \u2014 they\u2019re coming to take your guns; they\u2019re coming for you; the media can\u2019t be trusted; violent reaction is all but inevitable \u2014 seems not only to form the backbone of far-right propaganda but to contain significant parallels to today\u2019s mainstream conservative ideology. As a text, it offers the kind of heady heroic narrative that appeals to would-be rebels, patriots, and martyrs for a cause. It teaches its adherents not just to adopt the mentality that they are at war with progressives, but that a real-life war is inevitable. As the New York Times observed after the Capitol insurrection, a Telegram user watching the melee wrote, \u201cThe turner diaries mentioned this. Keep reading.\u201d\n\nStill, Berger told Vox that while prohibiting access to The Turner Diaries is an important part of dismantling white supremacy, it\u2019s not as crucial as many in the media have made it seem. \u201cThe Turner Diaries is a landmark text in white nationalism, and it\u2019s worth talking about,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cBut I think its relevance to the Capitol Siege has been overplayed somewhat.\u201d\n\nBerger pointed out that while the book\u2019s removal from Amazon is a step forward, it\u2019s not the only such work out there that white supremacists have drawn inspiration from.\n\n\u201cThe book is already notorious and widely available online for free, so while it\u2019s probably a net positive that it\u2019s been removed from Amazon, it\u2019s not exactly a game-changer,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think the significance has more to do with Amazon waking up to the problem of extremist content on its platform, which can be seen in some of its other recent moves as well,\u201d he added. He noted that in recent weeks, Amazon has removed products promoting the QAnon conspiracy and banned white nationalist groups from its charity program, after previously removing merchandise related to other white supremacist and neo-Nazi organizations. \u201cSeveral of these removals are more pragmatically important because they deny revenue streams to current extremist leaders and groups,\u201d Berger explained.\n\nIn other words, it takes dismantling a white supremacist village to fully attack the ugliness that leads to real-world violence. Removing The Turner Diaries and these other elements from Amazon, along with deplatforming extremists from other parts of the mainstream internet, won\u2019t totally remove their ability to access harmful material that helps fuel their hate. Still, these actions may crucially make such material harder for potential recruits to find. As Berger concluded, Amazon and tech companies like it \u201cstill have some way to go, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d"}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/36175", "page_content": "internal conflict white supremacist anti-communist\n\n1. Introduction\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 \u2013 July 23, 2002) was an American white supremacist, author, and political activist.[1][2] He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English, Pierce was a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\n2. Life and Career\n\n2.1. Early Life and Education\n\nWilliam Pierce at a young age, in a high school military academy uniform. https://handwiki.org/wiki/index.php?curid=1307868\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, to a Presbyterian[3][4][5] family of English and Scotch-Irish descent in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities.[6] His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America.[7] After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence.[8] Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.;[9] he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942.[10] After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.[11]\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy.[12] As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction.[9] His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.[13]\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman.[14] Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics.[15][16] He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962.[15] He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.[17]\n\n2.2. Early Political Activities\n\nHis tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University (1962\u20131965) coincided with the rise of two social movements, the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War movement, which he regarded as Jewish-led, communist-inspired, and a threat to European Americans. He was briefly a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962,[18] but eventually resigned. In 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.[11] In 1966, moved to the Washington, D.C. and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was murdered in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP.\n\nAccording to the American neo-Nazi James Mason, during the first National Socialist World Congress in 1969, when a delegate asked what should be done with \"White race traitors\", Pierce formed with his hand a pistol being fired, rousing the audience to its feet.[19]\n\nIn 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting former Governor of Alabama George Wallace's bid for the presidency.[16] In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Ongoing disagreements caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance.[15] Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend.[20]\n\n2.3. National Alliance\n\nThe National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices,[21] the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.[22]\n\nIn 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service.[15] Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision.[15] Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show.[23]\n\nAn anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell-Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel, by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.[24]\n\nIn 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in Mill Point, West Virginia that he paid for with $95,000 in cash.[15] Here, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church, in what may have been a last-ditch effort to avoid paying taxes.[15] In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400) acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes.[25] The other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS.[26] He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, \"Race and Reality,\" aired from Richmond, Virginia.[27][28]\n\nOn May 19, 1996, Pierce made a rare personal appearance in the mainstream media, on 60 Minutes,[29][30] during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation\".[29] Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi,[15][16][24][31][31][32][33][34] although he personally rejected this label.[29] When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a \"slander\", while stating:\n\nI admire many things that Hitler wrote, many of the programs and policies that he instituted in Germany, but we do not blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.[29]\n\nIn 1998, Pierce also appeared on a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States.[35] As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek party Golden Dawn.[15] Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute[24] informational video titled America is a Changing Country,[36] and forming an anti-globalization group \u2013 the Anti-Globalization Action Network \u2013 to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.[24]\n\nPierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002.[37] On July 23, 2002, he died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nAfter his death, the British National Party published an article in remembrance of him.[38]\n\nBefore Pierce died, he allowed Robert S. Griffin, a tenured professor of education at the University of Vermont, to live with him for a month, with the result being the self-published work The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds (2001).[39] The book's title was taken from Pierce's favourite quote, an Old Norse proverb from the H\u00e1vam\u00e1l in the Poetic Edda:[40]\n\nDeyr f\u00e9, deyja fr\u00e6ndr, deyr sj\u00e1lfr et sama; ek veit einn, at aldri deyr: d\u00f3mr um dau\u00f0an hvern. Cattle die, kinsmen die you yourself die; I know one thing which never dies: the judgment of a dead man's life.[41]\n\n3. Novels\n\n3.1. The Turner Diaries\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald.[15] The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \"Day of the Rope\" mass hangings of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. This violence and killing is called \"terrible yet absolutely necessary\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground The Organization, led by the secret inner circe known as The Order (a reorganized SS).\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters.[15] Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"[42][43]\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order.[15] The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance.[15] The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington (state) , when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals. In 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.[44]\n\n3.2. Hunter\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In interviews, Pierce called Hunter more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"...an educational process\".\n\n4. Religion\n\nAlthough raised as a Presbyterian,[3] Pierce became an atheist as a teenager.[4][5] In the 1970s, however, Pierce created the religious philosophy of cosmotheism, based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, Man and Superman. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \"bogus religion\".[15][16]\n\nIn effect, cosmotheism is a form of panentheism, asserting that \"all is within God and God is within all.\" It considers the nature of consciousness to be mutable and destined to evolve, via biological eugenics, towards a complete 'universal consciousness,' or godhood. The word cosmos means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nAll we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood.\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\n5. Family\n\nPicture of Dr. William Pierce at an official National Alliance meeting in 1999, in Hillsboro, West Virginia. https://handwiki.org/wiki/index.php?curid=1136386\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist.[6] The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.[45] Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia.[15] In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce.[45] Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996. His final marriage, which lasted until his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena, whom he married in 1997.[4]\n\n6.

So what you have is a powerful teaching tool, a persuasive tool.\"\n\n\u2014 Pierce, quoted in a biography of him called Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, on the power of narrative\n\nBackground\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce's bigoted attitudes toward people of color were inculcated at an early age. He was born in Atlanta into an Old South aristocracy that included his mother and her ancestors. His great-grandfather, he has said, was governor of Alabama and attorney general of the Confederacy during the Civil War. According to a fawning biography of Pierce by University of Vermont Professor Robert Griffin, Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds: An Up-Close Portrait of White Nationalist William Pierce, he grew up in a Southern household during segregation with older relatives who treated a black servant like a virtual slave.\n\nPierce graduated from Houston's Rice University in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. It was during that time that Pierce became concerned by the threat to the white race that he believed was posed by the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements, and he joined the John Birch Society, a right-wing group that once accused President Eisenhower, among many others, of being a communist.\n\nThe John Birch Society, which generally rejected anti-Semitism, turned out to be too namby-pamby for Pierce. In 1966, he quit a job as a senior research scientist at a Connecticut aerospace firm to join George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party (1959-67). Upon buying a printing press, Pierce become editor of the party's National Socialist World. After Rockwell was assassinated the following year, Pierce continued to work with the remnants of the group, which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party. In 1968, Pierce became an official of Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting Alabama segregationist and former Gov. George Wallace's bid for the presidency. Willis Carto, already one of America's leading anti-Semitic activists, also joined the Wallace group and in 1970 he and Pierce reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance (NYA). But the two men had a major falling out, and each claimed to be the new group's leader. In 1971, Carto accused Pierce of stealing a mailing list belonging to Carto's anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby organization. Pierce had written to those on the mailing list, attacking the Liberty Lobby's leaders, including Carto. Eventually, Pierce won control of the NYA, which was limited to people under age 30 and focused on activities on college and university campuses.\n\nIn 1974, Pierce dropped the age limit and reorganized the NYA as the National Alliance (NA), which he would lead until his death in 2002. The NA, which aimed to be a vanguard party capable of leading the \"lemmings\" comprising the white masses to revolutionary victory, adopted the slogans \"Free Men Are Not Equal\" and \"Equal Men Are Not Free.\" Effectively a Leninist in terms of tactics, Pierce was not interested in winning his battle through electoral successes. He wanted his vanguard to lead the white masses to power, something that could only come after a period of ethnic cleansing that Pierce referred to as a \"temporary unpleasantness,\" the seizure of state power and creation of all-white nations.\n\nThe text that made Pierce famous, however, was his novel of race war, The Turner Diaries, published in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald after first being serialized in the NA publication Attack! The NA boasted that the book was a \"Blueprint,\" a \"Handbook for White Victory.\" Pierce told his seminal story through two years of diary entries by his white supremacist hero, Earl Turner. Turner carries out orders for the Organization, an underground group struggling against the System \u2014 an anti-white, anti-gun U.S. government that continually puts more restrictions on its citizens. Using \"detonators, timers, igniters and other gadgets\" built by Turner, the Organization spawns vicious warfare between blacks, Jews and whites as it takes over the country, city by city. The violence is unforgettably vivid. Turner describes slicing the throat of a Jewish shop owner \"from ear to ear,\" murdering a Washington Post editor with two shotgun blasts, and watching starving blacks barbecue and eat white children. By the novel's end, Turner is working for an elite survivalist group called the Order and plotting a suicide mission \u2014 flying a crop-duster plane strapped with a warhead into the Pentagon, the System's last remaining military stronghold. \"Two-thirds of the troops around the Pentagon are n------,\" Turner writes in his journal, \"which should greatly enhance my chances of getting through.\"\n\nPierce's novel has inspired many a terrorist. In 1983, the NA's Pacific Northwest leader, Robert Mathews, joined with three other Alliance members and, later, some 20 other people, to create The Order, a white supremacist terrorist group. Based on the group portrayed in The Turner Diaries, Mathews' gang ultimately robbed some $4 million from armored cars. Declaring \"War in '84,\" members of The Order murdered a well-known Jewish talk show host, Alan Berg, in Denver. (The first person on their hit list was Southern Poverty Law Center co-founder Morris Dees. They abandoned that attempt due to high levels of security.) Later that year, Mathews was killed in a shootout with the FBI. Pierce hailed his martyred acolyte, saying Mathews \"took us from name-calling to bloodletting.\"\n\nIn 1995, Timothy McVeigh, aided by Army pals Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier, blew up the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people, including 19 children. The day before, according to officials, McVeigh called an NA recorded message line seven times. When McVeigh was arrested, police found excerpts from The Turner Diaries in his car. After the attack, which was patterned on a similar bombing depicted in The Turner Diaries, Pierce predicted, or maybe hoped, that resentment of Jews, minorities and others would lead to terrorism \"on a scale the world has never seen before.\" In 1998, before three white men in Texas beat and dragged James Byrd Jr. to death behind a pickup truck, one of the men, John King, reportedly announced, \"We're starting The Turner Diaries early.\" There are many other cases, as well, where killers were said to be inspired by the novel.\n\nIn 1989, Pierce's publishing arm, National Vanguard Books, printed his second novel, Hunter, depicting the assassination of interracial couples, Jews and politicians. The book was dedicated to Joseph Paul Franklin, convicted of the sniper murders of at least two black men. That same year, on the 100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, Pierce editorialized that the Nazi leader was \"the greatest man of our era.\" In 1991, Pierce began broadcasting a shortwave radio program, \"American Dissident Voices,\" that was heard worldwide. Within months, it was carried by several AM stations.\n\nIn 1984, after several years in the Arlington, Va., area, Pierce paid $95,000 in cash for a 346-acre tract of land atop a small mountain in West Virginia, where he set up what would become the NA's permanent compound. He would build several structures on the land, including a building for his Cosmotheist Church, which housed the bogus religion conjured up by Pierce primarily as an unsuccessful tax dodge. It was from this compound that Pierce ran an empire that ultimately included sales of books, cassettes, music, and racist paraphernalia. The group created a system of monthly dues and produced a monthly update for its members, the National Alliance Bulletin. At its peak, around the time of Pierce's death in 2002, the NA had more than 1,400 dues-paying members.\n\nThe NA also served as a launching pad for many white supremacist terrorists. Besides the Order members, in 1996 officials arrested NA member Todd Vanbiber in Florida after a pipe bomb he was building exploded in his face. After Vanbiber was sentenced for federal firearms violations, other NA confederates testified that the Vanbiber gang had robbed three banks and donated at least $2,000 to Pierce. A week before the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, Larry Shoemake opened fire on a black neighborhood in Jackson, Miss., killing one person and wounding seven others. Relatives said he was inspired by Pierce's writings.\n\nIn 1999, Pierce made an important business investment, buying white power music label Resistance Records for some $250,000. The deal gave Pierce control of the label's CD catalogue, inventory, mailing list and publishing arm. In the next few years, Resistance came to dominate the white power music scene and also became the biggest moneymaker in the NA empire. Pierce added to that empire in 2000, after \"national socialist black metal\" musician and convicted German murderer Hendrik M\u00f6bus took up residence at the NA headquarters. M\u00f6bus' music label, Cymophane, was then transferred to Pierce's control. Three months after arriving at the compound, M\u00f6bus was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued in Germany. Pierce spearheaded a campaign to free M\u00f6bus and raised money to pay for his legal fees. Ultimately, however, M\u00f6bus was deported and jailed in Germany.\n\nIn 2001, in a major break with the past, the NA began to hold rallies and engage in other public activities like leafleting. Organized by Deputy Membership Coordinator Billy Roper, NA members joined, for the first time, with other white supremacists in front of the Israeli Embassy to protest Jewish influence in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce married five times. His first wife was Patricia Jones, whom he met while at the California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce was remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, who worked for the NA. The marriage ended in 1985, when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. In Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce talks of preferring immigrant women from Eastern Europe. He married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage that lasted until 1990, when she left Pierce and West Virginia \"for greener pastures in California.\" Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsannah, also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine. Zsuzsannah left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997. He was sharp and condescending toward his last wife, identified only with the pseudonym Irena in Fame, when he was not ignoring her. Irena was miserable living with the savior of the white race.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce made his last public speech at one of the NA's secretive \"leadership conferences\" that were held twice a year at the West Virginia compound. Held on April 20, Hitler's birthday, Pierce emphasized the need to continue building a professional organization while rejecting alliances with other hate groups, whom he derisively mocked. For the 10 days before his unforeseen death from kidney failure and cancer on July 23, 2002, Pierce instructed his subordinates, and worked feverishly to try to assure the survival of the NA. Pierce died an old-fashioned death, appropriate for a man who conceived of himself in decidedly old-fashioned terms \u2014 as a lord among serfs, an elite leader uniquely capable of leading \"his people\" to victory over Jews, \"race traitors,\" and a whole host of other enemies.\n\nPierce's 2002 death came at a critical moment for the NA. A quarter-century after birthing the group, Pierce had finally remade his outfit into a remarkably professional organization. Much of the previous two years had been spent building up a talented staff, learning how to run a profitable business, and intensifying recruiting and propaganda. Just before his death, the NA was bringing in more than $1 million a year, had a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history. Pierce's voice, broadcast via his \"American Dissident Voices\" Internet show, was being heard in Europe and the U.S. In just five days in June 2002, NA members in 20 states distributed 70,000 leaflets.\n\nSix days after Pierce's death, a committee of his key staffers announced that the NA had selected a new leader. Erich Gliebe, the hard-edged former boxer who fought professionally as \"The Aryan Barbarian,\" would be the new chairman, although all agreed that no one could replace Pierce, who was memorialized as \"Our Eternal Chairman,\" comparable to Hitler himself. But Pierce's condescending and harsh words during his final speech doomed the group. His comments that other hate groups were filled with \"freaks and weaklings,\" something first disclosed by the Intelligence Report, seriously undermined the group by driving away its customer base. Within a few months, infighting broke out among the leadership, and splits started to occur. By 2009, the NA had lost nearly all of its members, falling from a high of more than 1,400 to fewer than than 100, Resistance was losing money, and Gliebe was living in the basement of his mother's Cleveland-area home."}, {"url": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/31/william-luther-pierce-white-supremacist-son-kelvin-pierce", "page_content": "From an exposed bluff in Mill Point, West Virginia, Kelvin Pierce surveyed the remote place where his father chose to live and die. In a sense, he knew why. Kelvin is an avid outdoorsman, and even on a stark February day, with snow blanketing the earth and bitter wind whistling through the trees, he was moved by Appalachia\u2019s subtle splendor. He understood why a man might settle there.\n\n\u201cI love West Virginia,\u201d Kelvin had said earlier, on the four-and-a-half-hour drive from his home just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely my favorite place on the planet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also full of sorrow.\n\nWhen Pierce\u2019s father bought 346 acres in Mill Point, and relocated there permanently in 1985, he left his family behind. He started building a compound where a new kind of family \u2013 men and women of like mind \u2013 could live off the land and be free of outside influences. He moved into a rambling trailer home, where he lived with a series of wives who weren\u2019t Pierce\u2019s mother. He had divorced her, declaring the split \u201cnecessary in order for me to have the peace of mind I need to do most effectively what I must do with my life\u201d.\n\nNothing was more important to Kelvin\u2019s father than white supremacy. The abandonment and the hate \u2013 the abandonment for hate \u2013 is what Kelvin has spent the better part of his life struggling to understand.\n\nTo family and friends, his dad was Bill. To everyone else, he was William Luther Pierce III, one of America\u2019s most prominent white nationalists.\n\nA physics professor turned neo-Nazi, William Pierce led a hate group called the National Alliance and a business empire that, at the time of his death from cancer in 2002, raked in $1m a year. He published books and magazines, hosted a radio program, and owned a music label, all of which promoted white supremacy. His work galvanized violent gangs, such as the Order and the Aryan Republican Army. Most infamously, it inspired the architect of the Oklahoma City bombing \u2013 Timothy McVeigh designed the attack based in part on Pierce\u2019s 1978 novel The Turner Diaries.\n\nReportedly called \u201cthe bible of the racist right\u201d by the FBI, The Turner Diaries is a fantasy about white militants overthrowing the US government as part of a bloody race war. A 2016 report found that the book had been tied to at least 200 murders, committed in 40 terrorist attacks and hate crimes. This year, during the 6 January coup attempt, there were echoes of the novel\u2019s core ideas in insurrectionists\u2019 calls to kill members of Congress, and in a gallows erected near the Capitol.\n\nWilliam Pierce raised Kelvin to hate Jews, Black people, immigrants \u2013 anyone who wasn\u2019t white. Now 60, Kelvin has long rejected his father\u2019s ideology, but only recently has he reached the point where he\u2019s ready to talk about his upbringing, and how his story illuminates the toxic currents roiling America. \u201cIf I can help one other person that felt the way I used to feel, to feel better and to make different choices, then that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cAnd I think I can help more than one person.\u201d\n\nWhen he was little, Kelvin would sneak into his dad\u2019s home office in northern Virginia to look at the bust of Adolf Hitler and the glass paperweight in the shape of a swastika that sat on the desk. Kelvin didn\u2019t know what the items meant, and William Pierce wasn\u2019t interested in explaining. He rarely spent time with Kelvin and his twin brother, Erik, preferring to fraternize with George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi party, or to lock himself away writing articles decrying Jewish power and interracial marriage.\n\nKelvin\u2019s strongest memories of his dad involve abuse. Any disobedience or perception of bad behavior led to beatings with whatever was at hand: a belt, a wire hanger, a two-by-four. The violence left Kelvin with bruises and a deep well of self-loathing.\n\nHis mom, Patty, didn\u2019t approve of the cruelty, but she didn\u2019t do much to intervene. She took a similar approach to her husband\u2019s extremism, which he\u2019d nurtured since at least the early 1960s. A math professor and the family breadwinner, because her husband had given up his own academic career to become an ideologue of hate, Patty did all of William Pierce\u2019s accounting and typing. Kelvin said his mom was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d when her husband started a firearms business \u2013 not because he advertised his stock as \u201cNegro control equipment\u201d necessary for \u201cthe coming race war\u201d, but because it prompted newspapers to publish articles about him. Patty worried that someone might come to the house and hurt her family.\n\nFamily photos from the archive of Kelvin Pierce. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWhen her sons told her that neighborhood kids made fun of them by calling them Nazis, she lamented that \u201cit\u2019s a terrible world\u201d and \u201cpeople are awful\u201d. She didn\u2019t answer when Kelvin asked her what a Nazi was, and she didn\u2019t tell her boys that their father was to blame for what was happening to them.\n\nAs a teenager, Kelvin was a bigot because he didn\u2019t know any other way to be. He also hoped it would impress his dad. In high school, he gave a presentation on Hitler\u2019s virtues and used the N-word to talk about Black classmates. By the time he went to college, he was \u201ca mobile advertisement\u201d for his father\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel superior to be part of the white race,\u201d Kelvin later wrote. \u201cYet deep, deep down, something didn\u2019t quite feel right about it either.\u201d\n\nHe began to change when he transferred from a small Christian college to Virginia Tech. He roomed with a young man from South America who was \u201cthoughtful, caring and very intelligent\u201d \u2013 all things that Kelvin\u2019s father insisted people who weren\u2019t white couldn\u2019t be. He took classes with students who saw the world very differently than he did. When Ronald Reagan was elected president and many of his liberal peers were visibly upset \u2013 including his roommate, who drew a dagger and drops of blood on a photo of Reagan \u2013 he wanted to understand why. He started paying attention to politics and watching the evening news, which his dad had always said was worthless because Jews controlled the media. Kelvin wondered if everything he\u2019d been taught was wrong.\n\nHe met a fellow student named Susan when they were both engineering interns with the navy one summer. Kelvin thought she was beautiful, but while his racism was rapidly dissipating, his shame \u2013 the feeling that his dad had abused him for a reason, that he deserved it \u2013 was not. He couldn\u2019t imagine making the first move, but Susan could. \u201cYou know, if you were to ask me out, I would say yes,\u201d she announced one day.\n\nThey were married in 1986. William Pierce came to the wedding. His gift to the bride and groom was a box of 9mm ammunition. \u201cTo keep the wolves away from your door!\u201d his note read. Kelvin didn\u2019t even own a gun.\n\nBy then, William Pierce had divorced Patty, decamped to Mill Point, and curtailed contact with his sons. Kelvin only confronted his dad once, asking why he\u2019d chosen white supremacy over everything else in his life. \u201cIt was the only responsible thing I could do,\u201d his father replied.\n\nFor her part, Susan didn\u2019t think that William Pierce\u2019s worldview mattered. \u201cThank goodness that\u2019s a dying thought process,\u201d she recalled thinking \u2013 an assumption she now sees as optimistic, or perhaps naive. It was also hard for her to fathom the extent of the abuse Kelvin suffered.\n\n\u201cYou know, he hit me every day,\u201d he told her once.\n\n\u201cEvery day?\u201d she replied, incredulous.\n\nSusan had grown up in a home where, as she put it, \u201cWe were always hugging each other, and we always said, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe and Kelvin had kids only because they agreed to adopt them. \u201cI was just terrified of furthering my genes,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cI was so messed up and so damaged as a human being that I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of trying to make another human being.\u201d Their daughters, Mariame and Marieka, are from the country of Georgia. Kelvin vowed to love them like he\u2019d never been loved. He coached their softball teams and took them on camping trips.\n\nKelvin with his daughter Marieka. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWilliam Pierce never met his granddaughters. For seven years prior to his death, he didn\u2019t reply to the letters and photos documenting their childhood that Kelvin sent him. Despite everything, Kelvin kept reaching out. His anger at how he\u2019d been raised collided with yearning for paternal approval. When he first heard of the connection between The Turner Diaries and the Oklahoma City bombing, his kneejerk reaction was a perverse kind of pride that his dad was in the news. He was ashamed his mind went there, but at a loss for how to stop it.\n\nKelvin was battling his demons without armor or weapons. He was also doing it alone. \u201cYou\u2019re a mystery to me,\u201d Susan would tell him sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t tell me how you\u2019re really feeling.\u201d\n\nIn July 2002, his uncle called to tell him that his father was dead. Kelvin hadn\u2019t even known he was sick. He surprised himself by crying, then realized what he was really mourning: he had to let go of the futile hope that his father might one day love him. He went to West Virginia for the memorial service, where neo-Nazis offered their condolences and said Kelvin must have admired his father very much.\n\nHow little they know, he thought.\n\nHe looked like his dad \u2013 tall and lanky, with mournful eyes, a long, square jaw, and prominent ears. He shared William Pierce\u2019s introspection and his dislike of being told what to do. But the similarities ended there.\n\nAfter the service, he began to feel something new: he was sad for his father and the life he\u2019d led. It could have been different. But again and again, William Pierce had made the wrong choices, leaving heartache and hate in his wake.\n\nKelvin wanted to start making better choices of his own.\n\nTo Mariame Pierce, her dad\u2019s bookshelf told the story. When she was little, it held volumes about Kelvin\u2019s hobbies \u2013 mountain climbing, for instance. Over time, new titles appeared, ones about self-discovery and philosophy, written by Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra. While she was growing up, her dad was changing too. \u201cHe became more present and thoughtful, more conscious and intentional,\u201d said Mariame, now 25.\n\nKelvin had embarked on a \u201chealing\u201d journey, as he describes it. He read, reflected and prayed. He worked with a counselor to process his childhood trauma, including his father\u2019s belief system. He and Susan, who already ran a successful construction business together, started a charitable foundation to support orphanages in Georgia. When he posted pictures from visits to his daughters\u2019 native country, friends remarked that he looked uncharacteristically happy. \u201cTo make a child feel like at least somebody in the world loves them, it\u2019s the most amazing thing in the world,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nHe told his life story publicly for the first time at his local Rotary Club. He described how, in his youth, he\u2019d fantasized about traveling to Washington with a gun and opening fire on Black people. His teenage dreams now repulsed him. Afterward, audience members came up to thank him. Some of them were crying.\n\nThe more he talked about his experiences, the more people told Kelvin he should write a book. It took a seismic national event for him to decide they were right.\n\nOn 12 August 2017, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly. Watching the events unfold, \u201cI was immediately transported back to my childhood,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cThe hatefulness of their energy and what they were saying, the way they were saying it, especially \u2018You will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 it was just like being an eight- or nine-year-old kid, when my dad took me to an American Nazi party picnic.\u201d\n\nHe started writing what would become Sins of My Father, which he self-published in February 2020. In addition to telling Kelvin\u2019s personal story the book, written with Carole Donoghue, draws on private letters and other archival documents that reveal how perceived grievances, personal disappointment, and twisted self-regard led William Pierce to dedicate his life to white supremacy.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact moment when his father\u2019s beliefs began to curdle \u2013 stories of radicalization are never so precise \u2013 Kelvin finds seeds of discontent in the years when William Pierce was a new husband, a new father and newly endowed with his physics doctorate. \u201cI think Dad was becoming angry and resentful and was suddenly frightened of the future and the heaviness of it all,\u201d Kelvin writes. \u201cHe hated the idea of working for someone else. He never wanted to have to answer to anyone else, even his wife.\u201d\n\nThis period in William Pierce\u2019s life coincided with the rise of progressive identity politics \u2013 the acceleration of the civil rights movement, for instance, and the dawn of second-wave feminism. He wanted to be a man who mattered, a man people listened to. White nationalism allowed him to be that. His life became one long ideological devolution, nourished by the power and attention he accrued evangelizing about hate.\n\nKelvin Pierce photographed at his home in Vienna. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nIf the story sounds familiar, it is. America is still plagued by the forces of rightwing radicalization. Sins of My Father draws parallels between William Pierce and Donald Trump, who \u201cemboldened white supremacists and mass-shooters by his words and deeds,\u201d as Kelvin writes. \u201cIn many ways, Trump has succeeded where Dad failed. He has taken hate and discrimination mainstream.\u201d\n\nOther evidence of his father\u2019s enduring impact hit closer to home. After Marieka Pierce enrolled in a police academy in Virginia, one day in class, her instructors showed the room a picture of her grandfather, describing him as an example of a homegrown extremist. \u201cMy hand went up,\u201d Marieka later told her mom.\n\nThe instructors were stunned to hear about the family connection. William Pierce was a staple in their curriculum about hate crimes; they\u2019d been teaching recruits about him for as long as they could remember. They asked to meet Kelvin to get a fuller picture of the man who, in obituaries, was remembered as \u201ca cold and calculating racist\u201d and \u201cthe godfather of hate in this country.\u201d\n\nDonny MacMullen has his own take on William Pierce: he thinks Kelvin\u2019s father was a great man.\n\nMacMullen, who is in his 30s, with reddish brown hair, a full beard, and striking blue eyes, moved to Mill Point from Massachusetts a few years ago to help preserve Pierce\u2019s legacy. Today, he\u2019s the caretaker of the National Alliance compound, which amounts to a few scattered buildings and the rocky sprawls of land between them.\n\nThe place is in a state of disrepair, and people rarely visit, but there are reminders of the community Kelvin\u2019s dad was trying to build before he died: an AV facility stocked with equipment that was first-rate in the early aughts; a library that once housed several thousand volumes; stacks of slickly produced magazines promoting racism; a meeting house where William Pierce presided over annual National Alliance conferences. Today, even as Pierce\u2019s ideas continue to find adherents, the organization he started is a shade of its former self.\n\nMacMullen was happy to welcome Kelvin to the compound in February. Indeed, members of the National Alliance had long made clear that William Pierce\u2019s son could visit anytime. For more than 15 years after his father\u2019s death, however, Kelvin stayed away. He wasn\u2019t ready to make peace with it, because he wasn\u2019t at peace with himself.\n\nIt was a steep drive up switchbacks to the heart of the compound, where MacMullen was waiting, wearing a knit cap with a swastika stitched to the front. When Kelvin asked him about the symbol, MacMullen laughed. It just represents love for the white race, he insisted. Kelvin pointed out that it was associated with hate and genocide, and MacMullen shifted gears. If you love something deeply, he said, then you have to hate anything that threatens it.\n\nDonny MacMullen\u2019s office at the West Virginia compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThis was another way of expressing the sentiment of a meme MacMullen once posted on his Facebook page: \u201cI\u2019m white but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m racist \u2026 I will put my boot in your ass, my knife to your throat, and your body in the dirt if you f**k with me and mine.\u201d\n\nKelvin and MacMullen walked for a while on the property, just the two of them. If it was painful to talk with a man who revered his father \u2013 who saw virtue in a racist who beat him every day of his childhood \u2013 Kelvin didn\u2019t let it show. They talked about their divergent beliefs, and neither man was interested in budging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree,\u201d MacMullen said at one point.\n\nWhen Kelvin recounted the conversation to his best friend, Gil Jullien, who\u2019d come on the trip as moral support, Jullien was furious. \u201cOh, that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree to disagree!\u201d\n\nJullien was speaking from experience. He was troubled that a close childhood friend had become a vociferous Trump supporter, the sort who regularly posts racist and sexist content on Facebook. Once, when the two men were at a high school reunion talking politics, Jullien\u2019s friend had told him they\u2019d have to agree to disagree. Jullien wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s ruining our country, and I\u2019m not,\u201d he later explained.\n\nKelvin shares Jullien\u2019s moral compass. \u201cAggression and hate and violence are the epitome of cowardice,\u201d he said. But he doesn\u2019t want to feel antagonism or resentment toward anyone, not even white nationalists.\n\nHe prefers to listen and question, not to confront; to offer the possibility of connection rather than writing people off. His approach might not be for everyone, but for Kelvin it\u2019s vital. If he could be redeemed, why not someone like MacMullen?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting myself out there for people that want help and want change,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nBefore Kelvin left the compound, MacMullen gave him a copy of a book \u2013 a tome, really, at more than 1,000 pages. Written in 1978 by William Gayley Simpson, a white nationalist who ran in the same circles as William Pierce, Which Way Western Man? bemoans the supposed decline of white civilization, the rise of feminism and multiculturalism, and the alleged chokehold liberal orthodoxy has on modern society \u2013 it\u2019s a collection of white supremacy\u2019s greatest hits.\n\nMacMullen said the text meant a lot to him. Back home in Virginia, in the spirit of listening and questioning, Kelvin cracked the book and read the first 50 or so pages. \u201cIt kind of boils down to, do you live your life stuck in the rat race, within society\u2019s norms, or do you break out from that and try to live a more authentic life, doing what you want to do, what you feel is right versus what society says is right?\u201d he said.\n\nThe language struck a chord. He heard echoes of his own transformation, of setting a new course for himself. Whereas Kelvin chose a path defined by hope and inclusivity, people who admire his father have let bigotry be their guide. Still, in their journeys\u2019 common origin, Kelvin saw promise \u2013 the possibility of trying again, and getting it right this time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as insurmountable a task to start a recovery process as some people think. It does take discipline, but it actually works,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m living proof of that, right?\u201d\n\nThe trailer where William Luther Pierce once lived lies in disrepair at the National Alliance compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThe last time Kelvin saw his father, he jumped off a mountain.\n\nKelvin had started hang-gliding in his 20s, and during his first visit to the compound in West Virginia \u2013 the only one he took while William Pierce was alive \u2013 his dad had suggested he glide off one of the property\u2019s peaks. No way, Kelvin told him. There weren\u2019t open areas below where he could land. At best he\u2019d come away injured; at worst he could die.\n\nA few years later, in 1995, Kelvin traveled to Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia, for a series of flights over the Labor Day weekend. He invited his dad to come watch him. He didn\u2019t expect him to show, but as Kelvin was untying his glider from its rack on his truck, he heard a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cYou need a hand with that?\u201d his father asked.\n\n\u201cYou actually came,\u201d Kelvin replied.\n\nWith his father\u2019s help, Kelvin made quick work of maneuvering his 80lb glider to the launch site. Before them was a pleated vista, gentle peaks and valleys thick with late-summer green. Kelvin suited up and pointed to the landing field where his father could meet him. \u201cClear!\u201d he yelled, before taking a few running steps and leaving the earth.\n\nThe flight was perfect. A swell of wind \u2013 a lift, as hang-gliders say \u2013 allowed Kelvin to pilot much higher than he\u2019d planned, rendering his dad a dot on the ground. He stayed in the sky for an hour. The view was majestic: forests and farms and fields stretching beneath him.\n\nHe touched down with ease in a wide field. As he was packing up his gear, he heard the familiar voice again: \u201cWow, Kelvin, that was absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time in his life that Kelvin knew for certain he\u2019d impressed his father.\n\nThey stood in the landing field talking for a bit longer. Then father and son said their goodbyes and went their separate ways: William Pierce to what Kelvin called \u201chis life of hate at the compound\u201d; he to new chapters of his existence. Some, such as parenthood, would be joyous. Wrestling with his past would be torment. But just like he navigated the wind high above the mountains, Kelvin would steer himself to a place where he could land, safe and whole, and invite others to join him, if only they too have the courage to leap.\n\nKelvin Pierce at a park nearby his home in Virginia.

Pierce, a rocket scientist turned neo-Nazi writer who used a mix of intellect and hate to rise to the top of the American white supremacist movement and become the \u201cgodfather\u201d of skinheads, died Tuesday in his West Virginia compound.\n\nHe was 68. The cause of death was renal failure, a spokesman said.\n\nPierce, who freeze-dried rabbits and stockpiled guns in preparation for Armageddon, wrote the novel \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d a hate-filled book thought to have inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom his fenced-off compound in Hillsboro, W. Va., the tall, avuncular Pierce commanded an army of 1,500 skinhead followers, under the banner of the National Alliance, with dozens of chapters across the country and around the world.\n\nPierce called for the establishment of all-white \u201chomelands\u201d and the expulsion of blacks and Jews, and disseminated ideas through the Internet, books and rallies. The most recent National Alliance event was 10 days ago, a march in Gainesville, Ga., organized to intimidate the town\u2019s large--and growing--Latino population.\n\nWatchdog groups consider the National Alliance the most dangerous white supremacist organization, partly because Pierce helped spread its message to educated and professional people.\n\n\u201cWilliam Pierce created a very regimented, sophisticated network,\u201d said Deborah Lauter, Southeast regional director for the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cHe was the godfather of hate in this country. I imagine his death will be a blow to the movement.\u201d\n\nPierce is credited with extending the reach of the skinhead movement to angry teens by buying a white-power recording studio, Resistance Records, which churns out lyrics like: \u201cDid 6 million Jews really die or was it just a Zionist lie....\u201d He also designed a video game called Ethnic Cleansing.\n\nHis supporters say that he was misunderstood and that despite his image as a violent separatist, he was in fact a gentle man who liked walking through the woods with his Persian cat, Hadley, on his shoulders.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Dr. Pierce is one of those great men who will be better appreciated after he\u2019s gone,\u201d said Chester J. Doles, a National Alliance leader in Georgia. \u201cI mean, some of his teachings were just too advanced for his time.\u201d\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce was born in 1933 in Atlanta, the son of an insurance agent and journalist. He went to Rice University as an undergraduate, received his doctorate from the University of Colorado and then taught physics at Oregon State University. He also worked on jet propulsion at a Pratt & Whitney laboratory.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Pierce had left the scientific world to join the ranks of the growing Aryan movement. In 1974, he founded the National Alliance in Arlington, Va. Ten years later, he relocated to the hills of West Virginia, where authorities monitored him but mostly left him alone.\n\n\u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d is his best-known work, a fictional story published in 1978 about a group of neo-Nazis who violently overthrow the government.\n\nFederal prosecutors called the novel \u201ca blueprint\u201d for the Oklahoma City bombing, with McVeigh using the same explosive--ammonium nitrate fertilizer--as Pierce\u2019s character in the book and setting off his device about the same time, 9 a.m. McVeigh was a known acolyte of Pierce\u2019s, and a passage from \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d was found in McVeigh\u2019s car after his arrest.\n\nUnlike white supremacist leaders imprisoned for their connections to violent acts, Pierce was never convicted of a serious crime.\n\nThree weeks ago, he was diagnosed with widespread cancer, said Billy Roper, a National Alliance official.\n\nBut he chose to continue living in his compound and died of kidney failure in his room on Tuesday.\n\nPierce is survived by two sons and a brother.\n\nNational Alliance officials would not discuss who will succeed him."}, {"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66027922/william-luther-pierce", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English descent, Pierce was descended from the aristocracy of the Old South, descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nPierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States. In 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a Vietnam veteran McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II pilot and Washington, D.C.-area United States Department of Defense consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and liberal American journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, to a Presbyterian family of English and Scotch-Irish descent in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities. His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America. After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence. Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.; he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942. After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy. As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction. His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman. Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.\n\nEarly political activities\n\nHis tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University (1962\u20131965) coincided with the rise of two social movements, the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War movement, which he regarded as Jewish-led, communist-inspired, and a threat to European Americans. He was briefly a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962, but eventually resigned. In 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. In 1966, moved to the Washington, D.C. and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was assassinated in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP. In 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting former Governor of Alabama George Wallace's bid for the presidency. In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Ongoing disagreements caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance. Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend.\n\nNational Alliance\n\nThe National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices, the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.\n\nIn 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service. Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision. Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show.\n\nAn anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell-Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel, by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in Mill Point, West Virginia that he paid for with $95,000 in cash. Here, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church, in what may have been a last-ditch effort to avoid paying taxes. In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400) acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes. The other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS. He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, \"Race and Reality,\" aired from Richmond, Virginia.\n\nOn May 19, 1996, Pierce made a rare personal appearance in the mainstream media, on 60 Minutes, during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation\". Pierce was frequently described as a neo-nazi, although he personally rejected this label. When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a \"slander\", while stating:\n\nI admire many things that Hitler wrote, many of the programs and policies that he instituted in Germany, but we do not blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.\n\nIn 1998, Pierce also appeared on a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States. As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek party Golden Dawn. Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute informational video titled America is a Changing Country, and forming an anti-globalization group \u2013 the Anti-Globalization Action Network \u2013 to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.\n\nPierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002. On July 23, 2002, he died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nAfter his death, the British National Party published an article in remembrance of him.\n\nBefore Pierce died, he allowed Robert S. Griffin, a tenured professor of education at the University of Vermont, to live with him for a month, with the result being the self-published work The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds (2001). The book's title was taken from Pierce's favourite quote, an Old Norse proverb from the H\u00e1vam\u00e1l in the Poetic Edda:\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the mass hangings- \"the Day of the Rope\"- of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the entire city. This violence and killing is called \"Terrible yet Absolutely Necessary\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground The Organization.\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters. Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order. The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance. The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington, when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals.\n\nIn 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.\n\nHunter\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area.\n\nIn interviews, Pierce called Hunter more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"...an educational process\".\n\nReligion\n\nAlthough raised as a Presbyterian, Pierce became an atheist as a teenager. In the 1970s, however, Pierce created the religious philosophy of 'cosmotheism', based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, Man and Superman. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \"bogus religion\".\n\nIn effect, cosmotheism is a form of panentheism, asserting that \"all is within God and God is within all.\" It considers the nature of consciousness to be mutable and destined to evolve, via biological eugenics, towards a complete 'universal consciousness,' or godhood. The word cosmos means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nAll we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood.\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\nFamily\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia. In the headquarters, Pierce acquired a Siamese cat, Hadley, which stayed with him until his death. In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce. Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996. His final marriage, which lasted until his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena, whom he married in 1997."}, {"url": "https://archive.org/details/american-dissident_voices_wlp_dr._william_luther_pierce", "page_content": "favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite\n\ndoctor william luther pierce prophet of our time great man leader and thinker great quality files all saved and preserved for the future generations thank you\n\n- April 14, 2023good quality audio and truthful word of spiritual teacher and master the venerable DR.

First educated as a physicist, he later worked with George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. Pierce became well known as the author of a novel, The Turner Diaries (1978), written under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. He founded the religion of Cosmotheism, an admixture of panentheism, and promoted White nationalism, and White survival world-views.\n\nBackground and education\n\nWilliam Pierce was born on September 11, 1933 in Atlanta, Georgia. His father William L. Pierce II was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother Marguerite Farrell was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910. Her family were part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas Hill Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America. Pierce\u2019s father was an artillery officer in World War I.[1] After the war he served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.\n\nHis father started an insurance agency and moved the family to Norfolk, Virginia when he was four. In 1942, the senior Pierce died suddendly when he was struck by a car after stepping from a street car. After his father\u2019s death the family, which included his younger brother Sanders Pierce, moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.\n\nWilliam Pierce at a young age, in a high school military academy uniform.\n\nWilliam Pierce did well in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent at Allen Military Academy in Bryan, Texas. As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics and reading science fiction.\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He injured himself when a four inch pipe fell on his hand and spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman. Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice Institute (later renamed Rice University) in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice Institute in 1955 with a bachelors degree in physics.\n\nHe took an interest in aviation and obtained a private pilot's license in August 1958.[2] He had hopes of one day becoming an astronaut.\n\nHe worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for a few months before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. From July 1965 to June 1966 Pierce was employed as Senior Researcher Associate Physicist for the aircraft division of Pratt and Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut.[3]\n\nAmerican Nazi Party\n\nIt was during this time at Oregon State when Pierce began to notice two social movements on campus that disturbed him: the civil rights and the Vietnam anti-war movements. Pierce saw the Jewish-fueled civil rights movement as a threat to the white race. Also, he believed the anti-war movement to be communist-inspired and led primarily by Jews. He had a brief membership in the John Birch Society in 1962 but eventually resigned because they weren\u2019t critical of Jews.\n\nThat same year Pierce noticed the activities of George Lincoln Rockwell and his fledging American Nazi Party. In March 1962 Rockwell was attacked on stage when he was speaking at San Diego State College in California. Rockwell's talk was cancelled and the brawl was covered on national television. Pierce found Rockwell's address and began a several year correspondence. [4]\n\nIn 1966 Pierce became an associate of Rockwell. During this time he left his research position with Pratt and Whitney and went to work for Rockwell without pay. Pierce soon founded and became the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was assassinated in 1967, Pierce continued to work with the group--this time officially becoming a member and Ideological Officer--which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP).\n\nIn 1968 Pierce received national attention by becoming a Virginia arms dealer creating NS Arms. The venture sold \"Negro control equipment\" consisting of riot guns, handguns, semi-automatic rifles and chemical mace. Pierce advertised and used NSWPP literature with the warning \"Beat the Ban. Stock you home NOW--with weapons for the coming race war!\"[5]\n\nOn April 9, 1970 Pierce spoke before students at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania and said that President Nixon should be dragged out of his office and shot.[6]\n\nPierce left the NSWPP in July 1970[7] and took control of the National Youth Alliance in December 1970 which later became the National Alliance, incorporated in Virginia on February 26, 1974.[8] In August 1970 Pierce sent a proposal title Prospectus for a National Front to likeminded National Socialist around the country.\n\nNational Alliance\n\nIn 1973 Pierce testified against Secretary of State nominee Henry Kissinger before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stating Kissinger as a Jew would favor the interests of Israel over America.[9]\n\nThe National Alliance adopted the Life Rune as its symbol and this organization was to be a political vanguard designed ultimately to bring about a \u201cwhite racial redemption\u201d. His Cosmotheist Community Church, which was to be the next step of this plan, was set up in the mid-1970s, alongside Pierce\u2019s political projects; the National Alliance, National Vanguard Books, and the weekly broadcast American Dissident Voices. In 1978 Pierce applied for and was denied tax exemption claiming it from the Internal Revenue Service; he appealed and an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision. In 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a rural area near Mill Point, West Virginia.\n\nWhen Pierce bought the West Virginia land he incorporated it as the \u201cCosmotheist Community Church\u201d and applied for Federal, state and local tax exemptions. However in 1986, the \u201cChurch\u201d lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400 acres) acres and which had to exclusively used for \u201creligious purposes.\u201d The other 340 acres (1.6 km\u00b2) were for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were not ruled tax exempt.\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nPierce came to international public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing. The perpetrator, Timothy McVeigh, was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, including a detailed description of the mass hangings of many \u201crace traitors\u201d and of any white women who ever had had sex with any non-Whites and in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the entire city. The book, told through the perspective of Earl Turner \u2013 an active member of the white revolutionary underground \u2013 The Organization-culminates with Turner\u2019s nuclear suicide mission, of which destroyed the military command at The Pentagon, and thus preventing any invasion of the Organization-controlled California.\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an earlier chapter, when the book's main character is put in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters in Washington DC. Some have drawn parallels from the book to the actual bombing strikingly similar to the Oklahoma City bombing that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people in 1995. Although The Turner Diaries was originally only available by mail order and at events such as gun shows, it is still believed to have sold well over three quarters of a million copies.\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s calling themselves the Silent Brotherhood or sometimes simply The Order. The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the National Alliance. The Order\u2019s leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington when the FBI finally firebombed his hideout.\n\nMarriages\n\nPierce married five times. The first was with Patricia Jones whom he met while at California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985 when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage which lasted until 1990. Olga left Pierce and West Virginia \u201cfor greener pastures in California\u201d. Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsanna, who is also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in an Hungarian women\u2019s magazine. Zsuzsanna left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997.\n\nFinal years\n\nPierce spent his final years living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices and oversaw his publishing, National Vanguard magazine, Free Speech and Resistance as well as books published by his book publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc and his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nBefore Pierce died he allowed professor Robert S. Griffin to live with him for a month with the result being Pierce's biography : The Fame of a Dead Man\u2019s Deeds (2001) [1]. William Pierce died of cancer on July 23, 2002 at his home in West Virginia.\n\nWorks\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\n\nPart of this article consists of modified text from Wikipedia, and the article is therefore licensed under GFDL."}], "William Luther Pierce III worked on the staff of the George Washington University.": [{"url": "https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66027922/william-luther-pierce", "page_content": "There is a problem with your email/password.\n\nWe\u2019ve updated the security on the site.

So what you have is a powerful teaching tool, a persuasive tool.\"\n\n\u2014 Pierce, quoted in a biography of him called Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, on the power of narrative\n\nBackground\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce's bigoted attitudes toward people of color were inculcated at an early age. He was born in Atlanta into an Old South aristocracy that included his mother and her ancestors. His great-grandfather, he has said, was governor of Alabama and attorney general of the Confederacy during the Civil War. According to a fawning biography of Pierce by University of Vermont Professor Robert Griffin, Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds: An Up-Close Portrait of White Nationalist William Pierce, he grew up in a Southern household during segregation with older relatives who treated a black servant like a virtual slave.\n\nPierce graduated from Houston's Rice University in 1955 with a bachelor's degree in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. It was during that time that Pierce became concerned by the threat to the white race that he believed was posed by the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements, and he joined the John Birch Society, a right-wing group that once accused President Eisenhower, among many others, of being a communist.\n\nThe John Birch Society, which generally rejected anti-Semitism, turned out to be too namby-pamby for Pierce. In 1966, he quit a job as a senior research scientist at a Connecticut aerospace firm to join George Lincoln Rockwell's American Nazi Party (1959-67). Upon buying a printing press, Pierce become editor of the party's National Socialist World. After Rockwell was assassinated the following year, Pierce continued to work with the remnants of the group, which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party. In 1968, Pierce became an official of Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting Alabama segregationist and former Gov. George Wallace's bid for the presidency. Willis Carto, already one of America's leading anti-Semitic activists, also joined the Wallace group and in 1970 he and Pierce reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance (NYA). But the two men had a major falling out, and each claimed to be the new group's leader. In 1971, Carto accused Pierce of stealing a mailing list belonging to Carto's anti-Semitic Liberty Lobby organization. Pierce had written to those on the mailing list, attacking the Liberty Lobby's leaders, including Carto. Eventually, Pierce won control of the NYA, which was limited to people under age 30 and focused on activities on college and university campuses.\n\nIn 1974, Pierce dropped the age limit and reorganized the NYA as the National Alliance (NA), which he would lead until his death in 2002. The NA, which aimed to be a vanguard party capable of leading the \"lemmings\" comprising the white masses to revolutionary victory, adopted the slogans \"Free Men Are Not Equal\" and \"Equal Men Are Not Free.\" Effectively a Leninist in terms of tactics, Pierce was not interested in winning his battle through electoral successes. He wanted his vanguard to lead the white masses to power, something that could only come after a period of ethnic cleansing that Pierce referred to as a \"temporary unpleasantness,\" the seizure of state power and creation of all-white nations.\n\nThe text that made Pierce famous, however, was his novel of race war, The Turner Diaries, published in 1978 under the pseudonym Andrew MacDonald after first being serialized in the NA publication Attack! The NA boasted that the book was a \"Blueprint,\" a \"Handbook for White Victory.\" Pierce told his seminal story through two years of diary entries by his white supremacist hero, Earl Turner. Turner carries out orders for the Organization, an underground group struggling against the System \u2014 an anti-white, anti-gun U.S. government that continually puts more restrictions on its citizens. Using \"detonators, timers, igniters and other gadgets\" built by Turner, the Organization spawns vicious warfare between blacks, Jews and whites as it takes over the country, city by city. The violence is unforgettably vivid. Turner describes slicing the throat of a Jewish shop owner \"from ear to ear,\" murdering a Washington Post editor with two shotgun blasts, and watching starving blacks barbecue and eat white children. By the novel's end, Turner is working for an elite survivalist group called the Order and plotting a suicide mission \u2014 flying a crop-duster plane strapped with a warhead into the Pentagon, the System's last remaining military stronghold. \"Two-thirds of the troops around the Pentagon are n------,\" Turner writes in his journal, \"which should greatly enhance my chances of getting through.\"\n\nPierce's novel has inspired many a terrorist. In 1983, the NA's Pacific Northwest leader, Robert Mathews, joined with three other Alliance members and, later, some 20 other people, to create The Order, a white supremacist terrorist group. Based on the group portrayed in The Turner Diaries, Mathews' gang ultimately robbed some $4 million from armored cars. Declaring \"War in '84,\" members of The Order murdered a well-known Jewish talk show host, Alan Berg, in Denver. (The first person on their hit list was Southern Poverty Law Center co-founder Morris Dees. They abandoned that attempt due to high levels of security.) Later that year, Mathews was killed in a shootout with the FBI. Pierce hailed his martyred acolyte, saying Mathews \"took us from name-calling to bloodletting.\"\n\nIn 1995, Timothy McVeigh, aided by Army pals Terry Nichols and Michael Fortier, blew up the Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people, including 19 children. The day before, according to officials, McVeigh called an NA recorded message line seven times. When McVeigh was arrested, police found excerpts from The Turner Diaries in his car. After the attack, which was patterned on a similar bombing depicted in The Turner Diaries, Pierce predicted, or maybe hoped, that resentment of Jews, minorities and others would lead to terrorism \"on a scale the world has never seen before.\" In 1998, before three white men in Texas beat and dragged James Byrd Jr. to death behind a pickup truck, one of the men, John King, reportedly announced, \"We're starting The Turner Diaries early.\" There are many other cases, as well, where killers were said to be inspired by the novel.\n\nIn 1989, Pierce's publishing arm, National Vanguard Books, printed his second novel, Hunter, depicting the assassination of interracial couples, Jews and politicians. The book was dedicated to Joseph Paul Franklin, convicted of the sniper murders of at least two black men. That same year, on the 100th anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, Pierce editorialized that the Nazi leader was \"the greatest man of our era.\" In 1991, Pierce began broadcasting a shortwave radio program, \"American Dissident Voices,\" that was heard worldwide. Within months, it was carried by several AM stations.\n\nIn 1984, after several years in the Arlington, Va., area, Pierce paid $95,000 in cash for a 346-acre tract of land atop a small mountain in West Virginia, where he set up what would become the NA's permanent compound. He would build several structures on the land, including a building for his Cosmotheist Church, which housed the bogus religion conjured up by Pierce primarily as an unsuccessful tax dodge. It was from this compound that Pierce ran an empire that ultimately included sales of books, cassettes, music, and racist paraphernalia. The group created a system of monthly dues and produced a monthly update for its members, the National Alliance Bulletin. At its peak, around the time of Pierce's death in 2002, the NA had more than 1,400 dues-paying members.\n\nThe NA also served as a launching pad for many white supremacist terrorists. Besides the Order members, in 1996 officials arrested NA member Todd Vanbiber in Florida after a pipe bomb he was building exploded in his face. After Vanbiber was sentenced for federal firearms violations, other NA confederates testified that the Vanbiber gang had robbed three banks and donated at least $2,000 to Pierce. A week before the first anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, Larry Shoemake opened fire on a black neighborhood in Jackson, Miss., killing one person and wounding seven others. Relatives said he was inspired by Pierce's writings.\n\nIn 1999, Pierce made an important business investment, buying white power music label Resistance Records for some $250,000. The deal gave Pierce control of the label's CD catalogue, inventory, mailing list and publishing arm. In the next few years, Resistance came to dominate the white power music scene and also became the biggest moneymaker in the NA empire. Pierce added to that empire in 2000, after \"national socialist black metal\" musician and convicted German murderer Hendrik M\u00f6bus took up residence at the NA headquarters. M\u00f6bus' music label, Cymophane, was then transferred to Pierce's control. Three months after arriving at the compound, M\u00f6bus was arrested on an international arrest warrant issued in Germany. Pierce spearheaded a campaign to free M\u00f6bus and raised money to pay for his legal fees. Ultimately, however, M\u00f6bus was deported and jailed in Germany.\n\nIn 2001, in a major break with the past, the NA began to hold rallies and engage in other public activities like leafleting. Organized by Deputy Membership Coordinator Billy Roper, NA members joined, for the first time, with other white supremacists in front of the Israeli Embassy to protest Jewish influence in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce married five times. His first wife was Patricia Jones, whom he met while at the California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce was remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, who worked for the NA. The marriage ended in 1985, when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. In Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds, Pierce talks of preferring immigrant women from Eastern Europe. He married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage that lasted until 1990, when she left Pierce and West Virginia \"for greener pastures in California.\" Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsannah, also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine. Zsuzsannah left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997. He was sharp and condescending toward his last wife, identified only with the pseudonym Irena in Fame, when he was not ignoring her. Irena was miserable living with the savior of the white race.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce made his last public speech at one of the NA's secretive \"leadership conferences\" that were held twice a year at the West Virginia compound. Held on April 20, Hitler's birthday, Pierce emphasized the need to continue building a professional organization while rejecting alliances with other hate groups, whom he derisively mocked. For the 10 days before his unforeseen death from kidney failure and cancer on July 23, 2002, Pierce instructed his subordinates, and worked feverishly to try to assure the survival of the NA. Pierce died an old-fashioned death, appropriate for a man who conceived of himself in decidedly old-fashioned terms \u2014 as a lord among serfs, an elite leader uniquely capable of leading \"his people\" to victory over Jews, \"race traitors,\" and a whole host of other enemies.\n\nPierce's 2002 death came at a critical moment for the NA. A quarter-century after birthing the group, Pierce had finally remade his outfit into a remarkably professional organization. Much of the previous two years had been spent building up a talented staff, learning how to run a profitable business, and intensifying recruiting and propaganda. Just before his death, the NA was bringing in more than $1 million a year, had a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history. Pierce's voice, broadcast via his \"American Dissident Voices\" Internet show, was being heard in Europe and the U.S. In just five days in June 2002, NA members in 20 states distributed 70,000 leaflets.\n\nSix days after Pierce's death, a committee of his key staffers announced that the NA had selected a new leader. Erich Gliebe, the hard-edged former boxer who fought professionally as \"The Aryan Barbarian,\" would be the new chairman, although all agreed that no one could replace Pierce, who was memorialized as \"Our Eternal Chairman,\" comparable to Hitler himself. But Pierce's condescending and harsh words during his final speech doomed the group. His comments that other hate groups were filled with \"freaks and weaklings,\" something first disclosed by the Intelligence Report, seriously undermined the group by driving away its customer base. Within a few months, infighting broke out among the leadership, and splits started to occur. By 2009, the NA had lost nearly all of its members, falling from a high of more than 1,400 to fewer than than 100, Resistance was losing money, and Gliebe was living in the basement of his mother's Cleveland-area home."}, {"url": "https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/36175", "page_content": "internal conflict white supremacist anti-communist\n\n1. Introduction\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 \u2013 July 23, 2002) was an American white supremacist, author, and political activist.[1][2] He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English, Pierce was a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\n2. Life and Career\n\n2.1. Early Life and Education\n\nWilliam Pierce at a young age, in a high school military academy uniform. https://handwiki.org/wiki/index.php?curid=1307868\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, to a Presbyterian[3][4][5] family of English and Scotch-Irish descent in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities.[6] His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America.[7] After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence.[8] Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.;[9] he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942.[10] After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.[11]\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy.[12] As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction.[9] His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.[13]\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman.[14] Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics.[15][16] He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962.[15] He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.[17]\n\n2.2. Early Political Activities\n\nHis tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University (1962\u20131965) coincided with the rise of two social movements, the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War movement, which he regarded as Jewish-led, communist-inspired, and a threat to European Americans. He was briefly a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962,[18] but eventually resigned. In 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney.[11] In 1966, moved to the Washington, D.C. and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was murdered in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP.\n\nAccording to the American neo-Nazi James Mason, during the first National Socialist World Congress in 1969, when a delegate asked what should be done with \"White race traitors\", Pierce formed with his hand a pistol being fired, rousing the audience to its feet.[19]\n\nIn 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting former Governor of Alabama George Wallace's bid for the presidency.[16] In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Ongoing disagreements caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance.[15] Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend.[20]\n\n2.3. National Alliance\n\nThe National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices,[21] the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.[22]\n\nIn 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service.[15] Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision.[15] Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show.[23]\n\nAn anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell-Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel, by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.[24]\n\nIn 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in Mill Point, West Virginia that he paid for with $95,000 in cash.[15] Here, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church, in what may have been a last-ditch effort to avoid paying taxes.[15] In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400) acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes.[25] The other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS.[26] He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, \"Race and Reality,\" aired from Richmond, Virginia.[27][28]\n\nOn May 19, 1996, Pierce made a rare personal appearance in the mainstream media, on 60 Minutes,[29][30] during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation\".[29] Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi,[15][16][24][31][31][32][33][34] although he personally rejected this label.[29] When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a \"slander\", while stating:\n\nI admire many things that Hitler wrote, many of the programs and policies that he instituted in Germany, but we do not blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.[29]\n\nIn 1998, Pierce also appeared on a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States.[35] As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek party Golden Dawn.[15] Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute[24] informational video titled America is a Changing Country,[36] and forming an anti-globalization group \u2013 the Anti-Globalization Action Network \u2013 to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.[24]\n\nPierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002.[37] On July 23, 2002, he died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nAfter his death, the British National Party published an article in remembrance of him.[38]\n\nBefore Pierce died, he allowed Robert S. Griffin, a tenured professor of education at the University of Vermont, to live with him for a month, with the result being the self-published work The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds (2001).[39] The book's title was taken from Pierce's favourite quote, an Old Norse proverb from the H\u00e1vam\u00e1l in the Poetic Edda:[40]\n\nDeyr f\u00e9, deyja fr\u00e6ndr, deyr sj\u00e1lfr et sama; ek veit einn, at aldri deyr: d\u00f3mr um dau\u00f0an hvern. Cattle die, kinsmen die you yourself die; I know one thing which never dies: the judgment of a dead man's life.[41]\n\n3. Novels\n\n3.1. The Turner Diaries\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald.[15] The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \"Day of the Rope\" mass hangings of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. This violence and killing is called \"terrible yet absolutely necessary\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground The Organization, led by the secret inner circe known as The Order (a reorganized SS).\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters.[15] Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"[42][43]\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order.[15] The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance.[15] The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington (state) , when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals. In 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.[44]\n\n3.2. Hunter\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In interviews, Pierce called Hunter more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"...an educational process\".\n\n4. Religion\n\nAlthough raised as a Presbyterian,[3] Pierce became an atheist as a teenager.[4][5] In the 1970s, however, Pierce created the religious philosophy of cosmotheism, based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, Man and Superman. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \"bogus religion\".[15][16]\n\nIn effect, cosmotheism is a form of panentheism, asserting that \"all is within God and God is within all.\" It considers the nature of consciousness to be mutable and destined to evolve, via biological eugenics, towards a complete 'universal consciousness,' or godhood. The word cosmos means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nAll we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood.\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\n5. Family\n\nPicture of Dr. William Pierce at an official National Alliance meeting in 1999, in Hillsboro, West Virginia. https://handwiki.org/wiki/index.php?curid=1136386\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist.[6] The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.[45] Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia.[15] In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce.[45] Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996. His final marriage, which lasted until his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena, whom he married in 1997.[4]\n\n6. Works\n\nThe following works were published under the pseudonym \"Andrew MacDonald\":\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nHunter\n\nIn 1993, Pierce wrote the script of the comic book New World Order Comix #1: The Saga of White Will which was illustrated by Daniel \"Rip\" Roush and coloured by William White Williams.[46]"}, {"url": "https://handwiki.org/wiki/Biography:William_Luther_Pierce", "page_content": "William Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 \u2013 July 23, 2002) was an American white supremacist, author, and political activist.[3][4] He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English, Pierce was a descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nIn 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer.

Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities.[8] His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892.

The word cosmos means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nAll we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood.\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\nFamily\n\nPicture of Dr. William Pierce at an official National Alliance meeting in 1999, in Hillsboro, West Virginia.\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist.[8] The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.[47] Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia.[17] In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce.[47] Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996. His final marriage, which lasted until his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena, whom he married in 1997.[6]\n\nWorks\n\nThe following works were published under the pseudonym \"Andrew MacDonald\":\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nHunter\n\nIn 1993, Pierce wrote the script of the comic book New World Order Comix #1: The Saga of White Will which was illustrated by Daniel \"Rip\" Roush and coloured by William White Williams.[48]\n\nSee also\n\nAsa Earl Carter, a white supremacist who also wrote novels, under the pseudonym Forrest Carter.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n\nContemporary Voices of White Nationalism in America.

In a sense, he knew why. Kelvin is an avid outdoorsman, and even on a stark February day, with snow blanketing the earth and bitter wind whistling through the trees, he was moved by Appalachia\u2019s subtle splendor. He understood why a man might settle there.\n\n\u201cI love West Virginia,\u201d Kelvin had said earlier, on the four-and-a-half-hour drive from his home just outside Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely my favorite place on the planet.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also full of sorrow.\n\nWhen Pierce\u2019s father bought 346 acres in Mill Point, and relocated there permanently in 1985, he left his family behind. He started building a compound where a new kind of family \u2013 men and women of like mind \u2013 could live off the land and be free of outside influences. He moved into a rambling trailer home, where he lived with a series of wives who weren\u2019t Pierce\u2019s mother. He had divorced her, declaring the split \u201cnecessary in order for me to have the peace of mind I need to do most effectively what I must do with my life\u201d.\n\nNothing was more important to Kelvin\u2019s father than white supremacy. The abandonment and the hate \u2013 the abandonment for hate \u2013 is what Kelvin has spent the better part of his life struggling to understand.\n\nTo family and friends, his dad was Bill. To everyone else, he was William Luther Pierce III, one of America\u2019s most prominent white nationalists.\n\nA physics professor turned neo-Nazi, William Pierce led a hate group called the National Alliance and a business empire that, at the time of his death from cancer in 2002, raked in $1m a year. He published books and magazines, hosted a radio program, and owned a music label, all of which promoted white supremacy. His work galvanized violent gangs, such as the Order and the Aryan Republican Army. Most infamously, it inspired the architect of the Oklahoma City bombing \u2013 Timothy McVeigh designed the attack based in part on Pierce\u2019s 1978 novel The Turner Diaries.\n\nReportedly called \u201cthe bible of the racist right\u201d by the FBI, The Turner Diaries is a fantasy about white militants overthrowing the US government as part of a bloody race war. A 2016 report found that the book had been tied to at least 200 murders, committed in 40 terrorist attacks and hate crimes. This year, during the 6 January coup attempt, there were echoes of the novel\u2019s core ideas in insurrectionists\u2019 calls to kill members of Congress, and in a gallows erected near the Capitol.\n\nWilliam Pierce raised Kelvin to hate Jews, Black people, immigrants \u2013 anyone who wasn\u2019t white. Now 60, Kelvin has long rejected his father\u2019s ideology, but only recently has he reached the point where he\u2019s ready to talk about his upbringing, and how his story illuminates the toxic currents roiling America. \u201cIf I can help one other person that felt the way I used to feel, to feel better and to make different choices, then that\u2019s what I want to do,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cAnd I think I can help more than one person.\u201d\n\nWhen he was little, Kelvin would sneak into his dad\u2019s home office in northern Virginia to look at the bust of Adolf Hitler and the glass paperweight in the shape of a swastika that sat on the desk. Kelvin didn\u2019t know what the items meant, and William Pierce wasn\u2019t interested in explaining. He rarely spent time with Kelvin and his twin brother, Erik, preferring to fraternize with George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the American Nazi party, or to lock himself away writing articles decrying Jewish power and interracial marriage.\n\nKelvin\u2019s strongest memories of his dad involve abuse. Any disobedience or perception of bad behavior led to beatings with whatever was at hand: a belt, a wire hanger, a two-by-four. The violence left Kelvin with bruises and a deep well of self-loathing.\n\nHis mom, Patty, didn\u2019t approve of the cruelty, but she didn\u2019t do much to intervene. She took a similar approach to her husband\u2019s extremism, which he\u2019d nurtured since at least the early 1960s. A math professor and the family breadwinner, because her husband had given up his own academic career to become an ideologue of hate, Patty did all of William Pierce\u2019s accounting and typing. Kelvin said his mom was \u201cabsolutely terrified\u201d when her husband started a firearms business \u2013 not because he advertised his stock as \u201cNegro control equipment\u201d necessary for \u201cthe coming race war\u201d, but because it prompted newspapers to publish articles about him. Patty worried that someone might come to the house and hurt her family.\n\nFamily photos from the archive of Kelvin Pierce. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWhen her sons told her that neighborhood kids made fun of them by calling them Nazis, she lamented that \u201cit\u2019s a terrible world\u201d and \u201cpeople are awful\u201d. She didn\u2019t answer when Kelvin asked her what a Nazi was, and she didn\u2019t tell her boys that their father was to blame for what was happening to them.\n\nAs a teenager, Kelvin was a bigot because he didn\u2019t know any other way to be. He also hoped it would impress his dad. In high school, he gave a presentation on Hitler\u2019s virtues and used the N-word to talk about Black classmates. By the time he went to college, he was \u201ca mobile advertisement\u201d for his father\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel superior to be part of the white race,\u201d Kelvin later wrote. \u201cYet deep, deep down, something didn\u2019t quite feel right about it either.\u201d\n\nHe began to change when he transferred from a small Christian college to Virginia Tech. He roomed with a young man from South America who was \u201cthoughtful, caring and very intelligent\u201d \u2013 all things that Kelvin\u2019s father insisted people who weren\u2019t white couldn\u2019t be. He took classes with students who saw the world very differently than he did. When Ronald Reagan was elected president and many of his liberal peers were visibly upset \u2013 including his roommate, who drew a dagger and drops of blood on a photo of Reagan \u2013 he wanted to understand why. He started paying attention to politics and watching the evening news, which his dad had always said was worthless because Jews controlled the media. Kelvin wondered if everything he\u2019d been taught was wrong.\n\nHe met a fellow student named Susan when they were both engineering interns with the navy one summer. Kelvin thought she was beautiful, but while his racism was rapidly dissipating, his shame \u2013 the feeling that his dad had abused him for a reason, that he deserved it \u2013 was not. He couldn\u2019t imagine making the first move, but Susan could. \u201cYou know, if you were to ask me out, I would say yes,\u201d she announced one day.\n\nThey were married in 1986. William Pierce came to the wedding. His gift to the bride and groom was a box of 9mm ammunition. \u201cTo keep the wolves away from your door!\u201d his note read. Kelvin didn\u2019t even own a gun.\n\nBy then, William Pierce had divorced Patty, decamped to Mill Point, and curtailed contact with his sons. Kelvin only confronted his dad once, asking why he\u2019d chosen white supremacy over everything else in his life. \u201cIt was the only responsible thing I could do,\u201d his father replied.\n\nFor her part, Susan didn\u2019t think that William Pierce\u2019s worldview mattered. \u201cThank goodness that\u2019s a dying thought process,\u201d she recalled thinking \u2013 an assumption she now sees as optimistic, or perhaps naive. It was also hard for her to fathom the extent of the abuse Kelvin suffered.\n\n\u201cYou know, he hit me every day,\u201d he told her once.\n\n\u201cEvery day?\u201d she replied, incredulous.\n\nSusan had grown up in a home where, as she put it, \u201cWe were always hugging each other, and we always said, \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe and Kelvin had kids only because they agreed to adopt them. \u201cI was just terrified of furthering my genes,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cI was so messed up and so damaged as a human being that I couldn\u2019t fathom the idea of trying to make another human being.\u201d Their daughters, Mariame and Marieka, are from the country of Georgia. Kelvin vowed to love them like he\u2019d never been loved. He coached their softball teams and took them on camping trips.\n\nKelvin with his daughter Marieka. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nWilliam Pierce never met his granddaughters. For seven years prior to his death, he didn\u2019t reply to the letters and photos documenting their childhood that Kelvin sent him. Despite everything, Kelvin kept reaching out. His anger at how he\u2019d been raised collided with yearning for paternal approval. When he first heard of the connection between The Turner Diaries and the Oklahoma City bombing, his kneejerk reaction was a perverse kind of pride that his dad was in the news. He was ashamed his mind went there, but at a loss for how to stop it.\n\nKelvin was battling his demons without armor or weapons. He was also doing it alone. \u201cYou\u2019re a mystery to me,\u201d Susan would tell him sometimes. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you won\u2019t tell me how you\u2019re really feeling.\u201d\n\nIn July 2002, his uncle called to tell him that his father was dead. Kelvin hadn\u2019t even known he was sick. He surprised himself by crying, then realized what he was really mourning: he had to let go of the futile hope that his father might one day love him. He went to West Virginia for the memorial service, where neo-Nazis offered their condolences and said Kelvin must have admired his father very much.\n\nHow little they know, he thought.\n\nHe looked like his dad \u2013 tall and lanky, with mournful eyes, a long, square jaw, and prominent ears. He shared William Pierce\u2019s introspection and his dislike of being told what to do. But the similarities ended there.\n\nAfter the service, he began to feel something new: he was sad for his father and the life he\u2019d led. It could have been different. But again and again, William Pierce had made the wrong choices, leaving heartache and hate in his wake.\n\nKelvin wanted to start making better choices of his own.\n\nTo Mariame Pierce, her dad\u2019s bookshelf told the story. When she was little, it held volumes about Kelvin\u2019s hobbies \u2013 mountain climbing, for instance. Over time, new titles appeared, ones about self-discovery and philosophy, written by Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra. While she was growing up, her dad was changing too. \u201cHe became more present and thoughtful, more conscious and intentional,\u201d said Mariame, now 25.\n\nKelvin had embarked on a \u201chealing\u201d journey, as he describes it. He read, reflected and prayed. He worked with a counselor to process his childhood trauma, including his father\u2019s belief system. He and Susan, who already ran a successful construction business together, started a charitable foundation to support orphanages in Georgia. When he posted pictures from visits to his daughters\u2019 native country, friends remarked that he looked uncharacteristically happy. \u201cTo make a child feel like at least somebody in the world loves them, it\u2019s the most amazing thing in the world,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nHe told his life story publicly for the first time at his local Rotary Club. He described how, in his youth, he\u2019d fantasized about traveling to Washington with a gun and opening fire on Black people. His teenage dreams now repulsed him. Afterward, audience members came up to thank him. Some of them were crying.\n\nThe more he talked about his experiences, the more people told Kelvin he should write a book. It took a seismic national event for him to decide they were right.\n\nOn 12 August 2017, the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, turned deadly. Watching the events unfold, \u201cI was immediately transported back to my childhood,\u201d Kelvin said. \u201cThe hatefulness of their energy and what they were saying, the way they were saying it, especially \u2018You will not replace us\u2019 \u2013 it was just like being an eight- or nine-year-old kid, when my dad took me to an American Nazi party picnic.\u201d\n\nHe started writing what would become Sins of My Father, which he self-published in February 2020. In addition to telling Kelvin\u2019s personal story the book, written with Carole Donoghue, draws on private letters and other archival documents that reveal how perceived grievances, personal disappointment, and twisted self-regard led William Pierce to dedicate his life to white supremacy.\n\nThough it\u2019s impossible to pinpoint the exact moment when his father\u2019s beliefs began to curdle \u2013 stories of radicalization are never so precise \u2013 Kelvin finds seeds of discontent in the years when William Pierce was a new husband, a new father and newly endowed with his physics doctorate. \u201cI think Dad was becoming angry and resentful and was suddenly frightened of the future and the heaviness of it all,\u201d Kelvin writes. \u201cHe hated the idea of working for someone else. He never wanted to have to answer to anyone else, even his wife.\u201d\n\nThis period in William Pierce\u2019s life coincided with the rise of progressive identity politics \u2013 the acceleration of the civil rights movement, for instance, and the dawn of second-wave feminism. He wanted to be a man who mattered, a man people listened to. White nationalism allowed him to be that. His life became one long ideological devolution, nourished by the power and attention he accrued evangelizing about hate.\n\nKelvin Pierce photographed at his home in Vienna. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nIf the story sounds familiar, it is. America is still plagued by the forces of rightwing radicalization. Sins of My Father draws parallels between William Pierce and Donald Trump, who \u201cemboldened white supremacists and mass-shooters by his words and deeds,\u201d as Kelvin writes. \u201cIn many ways, Trump has succeeded where Dad failed. He has taken hate and discrimination mainstream.\u201d\n\nOther evidence of his father\u2019s enduring impact hit closer to home. After Marieka Pierce enrolled in a police academy in Virginia, one day in class, her instructors showed the room a picture of her grandfather, describing him as an example of a homegrown extremist. \u201cMy hand went up,\u201d Marieka later told her mom.\n\nThe instructors were stunned to hear about the family connection. William Pierce was a staple in their curriculum about hate crimes; they\u2019d been teaching recruits about him for as long as they could remember. They asked to meet Kelvin to get a fuller picture of the man who, in obituaries, was remembered as \u201ca cold and calculating racist\u201d and \u201cthe godfather of hate in this country.\u201d\n\nDonny MacMullen has his own take on William Pierce: he thinks Kelvin\u2019s father was a great man.\n\nMacMullen, who is in his 30s, with reddish brown hair, a full beard, and striking blue eyes, moved to Mill Point from Massachusetts a few years ago to help preserve Pierce\u2019s legacy. Today, he\u2019s the caretaker of the National Alliance compound, which amounts to a few scattered buildings and the rocky sprawls of land between them.\n\nThe place is in a state of disrepair, and people rarely visit, but there are reminders of the community Kelvin\u2019s dad was trying to build before he died: an AV facility stocked with equipment that was first-rate in the early aughts; a library that once housed several thousand volumes; stacks of slickly produced magazines promoting racism; a meeting house where William Pierce presided over annual National Alliance conferences. Today, even as Pierce\u2019s ideas continue to find adherents, the organization he started is a shade of its former self.\n\nMacMullen was happy to welcome Kelvin to the compound in February. Indeed, members of the National Alliance had long made clear that William Pierce\u2019s son could visit anytime. For more than 15 years after his father\u2019s death, however, Kelvin stayed away. He wasn\u2019t ready to make peace with it, because he wasn\u2019t at peace with himself.\n\nIt was a steep drive up switchbacks to the heart of the compound, where MacMullen was waiting, wearing a knit cap with a swastika stitched to the front. When Kelvin asked him about the symbol, MacMullen laughed. It just represents love for the white race, he insisted. Kelvin pointed out that it was associated with hate and genocide, and MacMullen shifted gears. If you love something deeply, he said, then you have to hate anything that threatens it.\n\nDonny MacMullen\u2019s office at the West Virginia compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThis was another way of expressing the sentiment of a meme MacMullen once posted on his Facebook page: \u201cI\u2019m white but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m racist \u2026 I will put my boot in your ass, my knife to your throat, and your body in the dirt if you f**k with me and mine.\u201d\n\nKelvin and MacMullen walked for a while on the property, just the two of them. If it was painful to talk with a man who revered his father \u2013 who saw virtue in a racist who beat him every day of his childhood \u2013 Kelvin didn\u2019t let it show. They talked about their divergent beliefs, and neither man was interested in budging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to agree to disagree,\u201d MacMullen said at one point.\n\nWhen Kelvin recounted the conversation to his best friend, Gil Jullien, who\u2019d come on the trip as moral support, Jullien was furious. \u201cOh, that\u2019s bullshit!\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree to disagree!\u201d\n\nJullien was speaking from experience. He was troubled that a close childhood friend had become a vociferous Trump supporter, the sort who regularly posts racist and sexist content on Facebook. Once, when the two men were at a high school reunion talking politics, Jullien\u2019s friend had told him they\u2019d have to agree to disagree. Jullien wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIn my opinion, he\u2019s ruining our country, and I\u2019m not,\u201d he later explained.\n\nKelvin shares Jullien\u2019s moral compass. \u201cAggression and hate and violence are the epitome of cowardice,\u201d he said. But he doesn\u2019t want to feel antagonism or resentment toward anyone, not even white nationalists.\n\nHe prefers to listen and question, not to confront; to offer the possibility of connection rather than writing people off. His approach might not be for everyone, but for Kelvin it\u2019s vital. If he could be redeemed, why not someone like MacMullen?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting myself out there for people that want help and want change,\u201d Kelvin said.\n\nBefore Kelvin left the compound, MacMullen gave him a copy of a book \u2013 a tome, really, at more than 1,000 pages. Written in 1978 by William Gayley Simpson, a white nationalist who ran in the same circles as William Pierce, Which Way Western Man? bemoans the supposed decline of white civilization, the rise of feminism and multiculturalism, and the alleged chokehold liberal orthodoxy has on modern society \u2013 it\u2019s a collection of white supremacy\u2019s greatest hits.\n\nMacMullen said the text meant a lot to him. Back home in Virginia, in the spirit of listening and questioning, Kelvin cracked the book and read the first 50 or so pages. \u201cIt kind of boils down to, do you live your life stuck in the rat race, within society\u2019s norms, or do you break out from that and try to live a more authentic life, doing what you want to do, what you feel is right versus what society says is right?\u201d he said.\n\nThe language struck a chord. He heard echoes of his own transformation, of setting a new course for himself. Whereas Kelvin chose a path defined by hope and inclusivity, people who admire his father have let bigotry be their guide. Still, in their journeys\u2019 common origin, Kelvin saw promise \u2013 the possibility of trying again, and getting it right this time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as insurmountable a task to start a recovery process as some people think. It does take discipline, but it actually works,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m living proof of that, right?\u201d\n\nThe trailer where William Luther Pierce once lived lies in disrepair at the National Alliance compound. Photograph: Johnathon Kelso/The Guardian\n\nThe last time Kelvin saw his father, he jumped off a mountain.\n\nKelvin had started hang-gliding in his 20s, and during his first visit to the compound in West Virginia \u2013 the only one he took while William Pierce was alive \u2013 his dad had suggested he glide off one of the property\u2019s peaks. No way, Kelvin told him. There weren\u2019t open areas below where he could land. At best he\u2019d come away injured; at worst he could die.\n\nA few years later, in 1995, Kelvin traveled to Spruce Knob, the highest point in West Virginia, for a series of flights over the Labor Day weekend. He invited his dad to come watch him. He didn\u2019t expect him to show, but as Kelvin was untying his glider from its rack on his truck, he heard a familiar voice.\n\n\u201cYou need a hand with that?\u201d his father asked.\n\n\u201cYou actually came,\u201d Kelvin replied.\n\nWith his father\u2019s help, Kelvin made quick work of maneuvering his 80lb glider to the launch site. Before them was a pleated vista, gentle peaks and valleys thick with late-summer green. Kelvin suited up and pointed to the landing field where his father could meet him. \u201cClear!\u201d he yelled, before taking a few running steps and leaving the earth.\n\nThe flight was perfect. A swell of wind \u2013 a lift, as hang-gliders say \u2013 allowed Kelvin to pilot much higher than he\u2019d planned, rendering his dad a dot on the ground. He stayed in the sky for an hour. The view was majestic: forests and farms and fields stretching beneath him.\n\nHe touched down with ease in a wide field. As he was packing up his gear, he heard the familiar voice again: \u201cWow, Kelvin, that was absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time in his life that Kelvin knew for certain he\u2019d impressed his father.\n\nThey stood in the landing field talking for a bit longer. Then father and son said their goodbyes and went their separate ways: William Pierce to what Kelvin called \u201chis life of hate at the compound\u201d; he to new chapters of his existence. Some, such as parenthood, would be joyous. Wrestling with his past would be torment. But just like he navigated the wind high above the mountains, Kelvin would steer himself to a place where he could land, safe and whole, and invite others to join him, if only they too have the courage to leap.\n\nKelvin Pierce at a park nearby his home in Virginia.

Pierce, a rocket scientist turned neo-Nazi writer who used a mix of intellect and hate to rise to the top of the American white supremacist movement and become the \u201cgodfather\u201d of skinheads, died Tuesday in his West Virginia compound.\n\nHe was 68. The cause of death was renal failure, a spokesman said.\n\nPierce, who freeze-dried rabbits and stockpiled guns in preparation for Armageddon, wrote the novel \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d a hate-filled book thought to have inspired Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J.

Va., the tall, avuncular Pierce commanded an army of 1,500 skinhead followers, under the banner of the National Alliance, with dozens of chapters across the country and around the world.\n\nPierce called for the establishment of all-white \u201chomelands\u201d and the expulsion of blacks and Jews, and disseminated ideas through the Internet, books and rallies. The most recent National Alliance event was 10 days ago, a march in Gainesville, Ga., organized to intimidate the town\u2019s large--and growing--Latino population.\n\nWatchdog groups consider the National Alliance the most dangerous white supremacist organization, partly because Pierce helped spread its message to educated and professional people.\n\n\u201cWilliam Pierce created a very regimented, sophisticated network,\u201d said Deborah Lauter, Southeast regional director for the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cHe was the godfather of hate in this country. I imagine his death will be a blow to the movement.\u201d\n\nPierce is credited with extending the reach of the skinhead movement to angry teens by buying a white-power recording studio, Resistance Records, which churns out lyrics like: \u201cDid 6 million Jews really die or was it just a Zionist lie....\u201d He also designed a video game called Ethnic Cleansing.\n\nHis supporters say that he was misunderstood and that despite his image as a violent separatist, he was in fact a gentle man who liked walking through the woods with his Persian cat, Hadley, on his shoulders.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, Dr. Pierce is one of those great men who will be better appreciated after he\u2019s gone,\u201d said Chester J. Doles, a National Alliance leader in Georgia. \u201cI mean, some of his teachings were just too advanced for his time.\u201d\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce was born in 1933 in Atlanta, the son of an insurance agent and journalist. He went to Rice University as an undergraduate, received his doctorate from the University of Colorado and then taught physics at Oregon State University. He also worked on jet propulsion at a Pratt & Whitney laboratory.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Pierce had left the scientific world to join the ranks of the growing Aryan movement. In 1974, he founded the National Alliance in Arlington, Va. Ten years later, he relocated to the hills of West Virginia, where authorities monitored him but mostly left him alone.\n\n\u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d is his best-known work, a fictional story published in 1978 about a group of neo-Nazis who violently overthrow the government.\n\nFederal prosecutors called the novel \u201ca blueprint\u201d for the Oklahoma City bombing, with McVeigh using the same explosive--ammonium nitrate fertilizer--as Pierce\u2019s character in the book and setting off his device about the same time, 9 a.m. McVeigh was a known acolyte of Pierce\u2019s, and a passage from \u201cThe Turner Diaries\u201d was found in McVeigh\u2019s car after his arrest.\n\nUnlike white supremacist leaders imprisoned for their connections to violent acts, Pierce was never convicted of a serious crime.\n\nThree weeks ago, he was diagnosed with widespread cancer, said Billy Roper, a National Alliance official.\n\nBut he chose to continue living in his compound and died of kidney failure in his room on Tuesday.\n\nPierce is survived by two sons and a brother.\n\nNational Alliance officials would not discuss who will succeed him."}, {"url": "https://archive.org/details/american-dissident_voices_wlp_dr._william_luther_pierce", "page_content": "favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite\n\ndoctor william luther pierce prophet of our time great man leader and thinker great quality files all saved and preserved for the future generations thank you\n\n- April 14, 2023good quality audio and truthful word of spiritual teacher and master the venerable DR.

He taught in rural secondary schools in his native central Texas until 1898, when he won a fellowship to Harvard University. There he turned to physics, and after receiving his Ph.D. in 1900 he studied for a time in the laboratory of Ludwig Boltzmann in Leipzig, Ger.\n\nPierce returned to the United States and took up teaching at Harvard, where he served from 1903 to 1940. Upon the establishment of Harvard\u2019s Cruft High Tension Electrical Laboratory in 1914, he became its director. There he did work that led to the practical application of a variety of experimental discoveries in piezoelectricity and magnetostriction. He developed the Pierce oscillator, which utilizes quartz crystal to keep radio transmissions precisely on the assigned frequency and to provide similar accuracy for frequency meters.\n\nPierce was an exceptional teacher, and he offered a number of the earliest courses in radio communications. This pioneering teaching, together with his many influential publications on radiotelegraphy and electroacoustics, led to his being credited with building the scientific foundations of electrical communication. His other accomplishments include the mathematical calculation of the radiation properties of radio antennae; invention of the mercury-vapour discharge tube, which was the forerunner of the thyratron; invention of a method of recording sound on film; and work on the magnetostriction of nickel and nichrome, which has important applications for underwater signaling and submarine detection. His later work concerned sound generation by bats and insects, a field in which he was still active and publishing in 1948.\n\nPierce wrote two classic textbooks, Principles of Wireless Telegraphy (1910) and Electric Oscillations and Electric Waves (1919)."}, {"url": "https://en.metapedia.org/wiki/William_Luther_Pierce", "page_content": "Dr William Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 \u2013 July 23, 2002) was the leader of the White nationalist organization the National Alliance and a principal ideologue of the white nationalist movement. First educated as a physicist, he later worked with George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party. Pierce became well known as the author of a novel, The Turner Diaries (1978), written under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. He founded the religion of Cosmotheism, an admixture of panentheism, and promoted White nationalism, and White survival world-views.\n\nBackground and education\n\nWilliam Pierce was born on September 11, 1933 in Atlanta, Georgia. His father William L. Pierce II was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother Marguerite Farrell was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910. Her family were part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas Hill Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America. Pierce\u2019s father was an artillery officer in World War I.[1] After the war he served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.\n\nHis father started an insurance agency and moved the family to Norfolk, Virginia when he was four. In 1942, the senior Pierce died suddendly when he was struck by a car after stepping from a street car. After his father\u2019s death the family, which included his younger brother Sanders Pierce, moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.\n\nWilliam Pierce at a young age, in a high school military academy uniform.\n\nWilliam Pierce did well in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent at Allen Military Academy in Bryan, Texas. As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics and reading science fiction.\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He injured himself when a four inch pipe fell on his hand and spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman. Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice Institute (later renamed Rice University) in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice Institute in 1955 with a bachelors degree in physics.\n\nHe took an interest in aviation and obtained a private pilot's license in August 1958.[2] He had hopes of one day becoming an astronaut.\n\nHe worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for a few months before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. From July 1965 to June 1966 Pierce was employed as Senior Researcher Associate Physicist for the aircraft division of Pratt and Whitney in New Haven, Connecticut.[3]\n\nAmerican Nazi Party\n\nIt was during this time at Oregon State when Pierce began to notice two social movements on campus that disturbed him: the civil rights and the Vietnam anti-war movements. Pierce saw the Jewish-fueled civil rights movement as a threat to the white race. Also, he believed the anti-war movement to be communist-inspired and led primarily by Jews. He had a brief membership in the John Birch Society in 1962 but eventually resigned because they weren\u2019t critical of Jews.\n\nThat same year Pierce noticed the activities of George Lincoln Rockwell and his fledging American Nazi Party. In March 1962 Rockwell was attacked on stage when he was speaking at San Diego State College in California. Rockwell's talk was cancelled and the brawl was covered on national television. Pierce found Rockwell's address and began a several year correspondence. [4]\n\nIn 1966 Pierce became an associate of Rockwell. During this time he left his research position with Pratt and Whitney and went to work for Rockwell without pay. Pierce soon founded and became the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was assassinated in 1967, Pierce continued to work with the group--this time officially becoming a member and Ideological Officer--which by then was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP).\n\nIn 1968 Pierce received national attention by becoming a Virginia arms dealer creating NS Arms. The venture sold \"Negro control equipment\" consisting of riot guns, handguns, semi-automatic rifles and chemical mace. Pierce advertised and used NSWPP literature with the warning \"Beat the Ban. Stock you home NOW--with weapons for the coming race war!\"[5]\n\nOn April 9, 1970 Pierce spoke before students at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania and said that President Nixon should be dragged out of his office and shot.[6]\n\nPierce left the NSWPP in July 1970[7] and took control of the National Youth Alliance in December 1970 which later became the National Alliance, incorporated in Virginia on February 26, 1974.[8] In August 1970 Pierce sent a proposal title Prospectus for a National Front to likeminded National Socialist around the country.\n\nNational Alliance\n\nIn 1973 Pierce testified against Secretary of State nominee Henry Kissinger before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stating Kissinger as a Jew would favor the interests of Israel over America.[9]\n\nThe National Alliance adopted the Life Rune as its symbol and this organization was to be a political vanguard designed ultimately to bring about a \u201cwhite racial redemption\u201d. His Cosmotheist Community Church, which was to be the next step of this plan, was set up in the mid-1970s, alongside Pierce\u2019s political projects; the National Alliance, National Vanguard Books, and the weekly broadcast American Dissident Voices. In 1978 Pierce applied for and was denied tax exemption claiming it from the Internal Revenue Service; he appealed and an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision. In 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a rural area near Mill Point, West Virginia.\n\nWhen Pierce bought the West Virginia land he incorporated it as the \u201cCosmotheist Community Church\u201d and applied for Federal, state and local tax exemptions. However in 1986, the \u201cChurch\u201d lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400 acres) acres and which had to exclusively used for \u201creligious purposes.\u201d The other 340 acres (1.6 km\u00b2) were for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were not ruled tax exempt.\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nPierce came to international public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing. The perpetrator, Timothy McVeigh, was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, including a detailed description of the mass hangings of many \u201crace traitors\u201d and of any white women who ever had had sex with any non-Whites and in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the entire city. The book, told through the perspective of Earl Turner \u2013 an active member of the white revolutionary underground \u2013 The Organization-culminates with Turner\u2019s nuclear suicide mission, of which destroyed the military command at The Pentagon, and thus preventing any invasion of the Organization-controlled California.\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an earlier chapter, when the book's main character is put in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters in Washington DC. Some have drawn parallels from the book to the actual bombing strikingly similar to the Oklahoma City bombing that destroyed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people in 1995. Although The Turner Diaries was originally only available by mail order and at events such as gun shows, it is still believed to have sold well over three quarters of a million copies.\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s calling themselves the Silent Brotherhood or sometimes simply The Order. The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the National Alliance. The Order\u2019s leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island in Washington when the FBI finally firebombed his hideout.\n\nMarriages\n\nPierce married five times. The first was with Patricia Jones whom he met while at California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957 and had twins sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1962. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985 when Pierce moved his headquarters to West Virginia. Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz in 1986, a marriage which lasted until 1990. Olga left Pierce and West Virginia \u201cfor greener pastures in California\u201d. Pierce then wed a woman named Zsuzsanna, who is also Hungarian, in early 1991. They met through an ad that Pierce placed in an Hungarian women\u2019s magazine. Zsuzsanna left him for Florida in mid-1996. His last marriage, which lasted until his death, was with another Eastern European woman whom he married in 1997.\n\nFinal years\n\nPierce spent his final years living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices and oversaw his publishing, National Vanguard magazine, Free Speech and Resistance as well as books published by his book publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc and his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nBefore Pierce died he allowed professor Robert S. Griffin to live with him for a month with the result being Pierce's biography : The Fame of a Dead Man\u2019s Deeds (2001) [1]. William Pierce died of cancer on July 23, 2002 at his home in West Virginia.\n\nWorks\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\n\nPart of this article consists of modified text from Wikipedia, and the article is therefore licensed under GFDL."}, {"url": "https://alchetron.com/William-Luther-Pierce", "page_content": "William Luther Pierce III (September 11, 1933 \u2013 July 23, 2002) was an American white supremacist, author, and political activist. He was one of the most influential ideologues of the white nationalist movement for some 30 years before his death. A physicist by profession, he was also an author under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald of the novels The Turner Diaries and Hunter. Pierce founded the National Alliance, a major white nationalist organization, which he led for almost thirty years.\n\nBorn in Atlanta, Georgia, to a Presbyterian family of Scots-Irish and English descent, Pierce was descended from the aristocracy of the Old South, descendant of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. As a child, Pierce did well academically, graduating from high school in 1952. He received a baccalaureate in physics from Rice University in 1955, earned a doctorate from University of Colorado at Boulder in 1962, and became an assistant professor of physics at the Oregon State University in 1962, where he joined the anti-communist John Birch Society. In 1965 he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney in Connecticut. In 1966 Pierce moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, who was assassinated in 1967, after which Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\n\nPierce intended the National Alliance to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist revolution in the United States. In 1978, Pierce wrote, under the pseudonym \"Andrew Macdonald\", the novel The Turner Diaries, which depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by world war, and the extermination of non-white races. In 1984, he wrote another novel, Hunter, portraying the actions of a Vietnam veteran McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II pilot and Washington, D.C.-area United States Department of Defense consultant who embarks on a plan to assassinate interracial couples and liberal American journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church to receive tax exemption for his organization. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly shortwave radio show, American Dissident Voices, publishing the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and overseeing his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and music produced by his record company, Resistance Records.\n\nIn 2002, Pierce died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members and a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born on September 11, 1933, to a Presbyterian family of English and Scotch-Irish descent in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of William Luther Pierce Jr. and Marguerite Farrell. Pierce's younger brother, Sanders, an engineer, was born in 1936, and later assisted Pierce in his political activities. His father was born in Christiansburg, Virginia in 1892. His mother was born in Richland, Georgia in 1910, with her family being part of the aristocracy of the Old South, descendants of Thomas H. Watts, the Governor of Alabama and Attorney General of the Confederate States of America. After the American Civil War, the family lived a working-class existence. Pierce's father once served as a government representative on ocean-going cargo ships and sent reports back to Washington, D.C.; he later became manager of an insurance agency but was killed in a car accident in 1942. After the elder Pierce's death, the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama and then to Dallas, Texas.\n\nPierce performed well academically in school, skipping one grade. His last two years in high school were spent in a military academy. As a teenager his hobbies and interests were model rockets, chemistry, radios, electronics, and reading science fiction. His first aspiration was to become an astronaut.\n\nAfter finishing military school in 1951, Pierce worked briefly in an oil field as a roustabout. He was injured when a four-inch (10 cm) pipe fell on his hand, and he spent the rest of that summer working as a shoe salesman. Pierce earned a scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a baccalaureate in physics. He worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratory before attending graduate school, first at Caltech and then the University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, where he earned his doctorate in 1962. He taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965.\n\nEarly political activities\n\nHis tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University (1962\u20131965) coincided with the rise of two social movements, the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Vietnam War movement, which he regarded as Jewish-led, communist-inspired, and a threat to European Americans. He was briefly a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society in 1962, but eventually resigned. In 1965, in order to finance his political ambitions, Pierce left his tenure at Oregon State University and relocated to North Haven, Connecticut, to work as a senior researcher at the Advanced Materials Research and Development Laboratory of aerospace manufacturer Pratt & Whitney. In 1966, moved to the Washington, D.C. and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. During this time he was the editor of the party's ideological journal, National Socialist World. When Rockwell was assassinated in 1967, Pierce became one of the leading members of the National Socialist White People's Party, the successor to the ANP. In 1968, Pierce left the NSWPP and joined Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting former Governor of Alabama George Wallace's bid for the presidency. In 1970, along with Willis Carto, he reconfigured Youth for Wallace into the National Youth Alliance. By 1971, Pierce and Carto were openly feuding. Ongoing disagreements caused the NYA to split, and by 1974 Pierce's wing became known as the National Alliance. Among the founding members of the board of the National Alliance was professor of classics at the University of Illinois Revilo P. Oliver, who was to have major impact of Pierce's life both as an adviser and friend.\n\nNational Alliance\n\nThe National Alliance was organized in 1974. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia, where he hosted a weekly radio show, American Dissident Voices, the internal newsletter National Alliance Bulletin (formerly called Action), and oversaw his publications, National Vanguard Magazine (originally titled Attack!), Free Speech and Resistance, as well as books published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. (many of which promoted Holocaust denial) and his record company, Resistance Records. On the topic of the Holocaust, he believed that the number of deaths has been exaggerated, and that many of the details had been fabricated.\n\nIn 1978, claiming that the National Alliance was an educational organization, Pierce applied for, and was denied, tax exemption by the Internal Revenue Service. Pierce appealed, but an appellate court upheld the I.R.S. decision. Around the same time, he was interviewed by Herbert Poinsett on Race and Reason, a public-access television cable TV talk show.\n\nAn anti-zionist, he attempted during the Yom Kippur War to force McDonnell-Douglas into canceling military contracts that sent armaments to Israel, by buying shares of the company's stock and putting forward the motion at the national shareholder's meeting. The company rejected the motion and continued supplying Israel with weapons. Some of Pierce's later speeches on American Dissident Voices concerning the Arab-Israeli conflict were reprinted in Muslim publications and on websites, including that of the Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah.\n\nIn 1985, Pierce moved his operations from Arlington, Virginia, to a 346-acre (1.40 km2) location in Mill Point, West Virginia that he paid for with $95,000 in cash. Here, he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church, in what may have been a last-ditch effort to avoid paying taxes. In 1986, the church applied again, this time successfully, for federal, state, and local tax exemptions, however lost its state tax exemption for all but 60 (out of nearly 400) acres, which had to be exclusively used for religious purposes. The other 286 acres (1.16 km2) were used for both the National Alliance headquarters and the National Vanguard Books business and warehouse, and were denied tax exemption.\n\nIn 1990, the documentary series Different Drummer produced a portrait of Pierce, which was aired on PBS. He later participated twice on a public-access television cable TV live talk show hosted by Ron Doggett, \"Race and Reality,\" aired from Richmond, Virginia.\n\nOn May 19, 1996, Pierce made a rare personal appearance in the mainstream media, on 60 Minutes, during which Pierce was asked by Mike Wallace if he approved of the Oklahoma City bombing, and he replied \"No. No, I don't. I've said that over and over again, that I do not approve of the Oklahoma City bombing because the United States is not yet in a revolutionary situation\". Pierce was frequently described as a neo-nazi, although he personally rejected this label. When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on 60 minutes, Pierce described the term as a \"slander\", while stating:\n\nI admire many things that Hitler wrote, many of the programs and policies that he instituted in Germany, but we do not blindly copy anyone else's policies or programs. We've formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today.\n\nIn 1998, Pierce also appeared on a documentary produced by the Discovery Channel about white nationalism in the United States. As the leader of the National Alliance, Pierce established contacts with other nationalist groups in Europe, including the National Democratic Party of Germany and the Greek party Golden Dawn. Pierce's other recruiting efforts included a 51-minute informational video titled America is a Changing Country, and forming an anti-globalization group \u2013 the Anti-Globalization Action Network \u2013 to protest at the G8 summit in Canada in June 2002.\n\nPierce's last public speech was made in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 28, 2002. On July 23, 2002, he died of cancer. At the time, the National Alliance was bringing in more than $1 million a year, with more than 1,500 members, a paid national staff of 17 full-time officials, and was better known than at any time in its history, after which it entered a period of internal conflict and decline.\n\nAfter his death, the British National Party published an article in remembrance of him.\n\nBefore Pierce died, he allowed Robert S. Griffin, a tenured professor of education at the University of Vermont, to live with him for a month, with the result being the self-published work The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds (2001). The book's title was taken from Pierce's favourite quote, an Old Norse proverb from the H\u00e1vam\u00e1l in the Poetic Edda:\n\nThe Turner Diaries\n\nPierce gained national public attention following the Oklahoma City bombing, as Timothy McVeigh was alleged to have been influenced by The Turner Diaries (1978), the novel written by Pierce under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald. The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the mass hangings- \"the Day of the Rope\"- of many \"race traitors\" (especially Jews, gay people, and those in interracial marriages or relationships) in the public streets of Los Angeles, followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the entire city. This violence and killing is called \"Terrible yet Absolutely Necessary\". The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground The Organization.\n\nThe part most relevant to the McVeigh case is in an early chapter, when the book's main character is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters. Some have pointed out similarities between the bombing in the book and the actual bombing in Oklahoma City that damaged the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and killed 168 people on April 19, 1995. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found in his car, with several phrases highlighted, including \"But the real value of all of our attacks today lies in the psychological impact, not in the immediate casualties\" and \"We can still find them and kill them.\"\n\nThe Turner Diaries also inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s who called themselves the Silent Brotherhood, or sometimes simply The Order. The Order were an offshoot of the Aryan Nations. They were tired of being merely \"armchair revolutionaries\". The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting and bank robbery, and supposedly gave money to the Alliance. The Order's leader, Robert Jay Mathews, died in a stand-off with police and federal agents on Whidbey Island, Washington, when police fired flares into his hideout, igniting a fire. Other Order members, most notably the late David Lane, were all captured and sent to federal prisons, where they still continue to voice their support for white nationalist ideals.\n\nIn 1996 Pierce sold the rights to The Turner Diaries to the Jewish publisher Lyle Stuart.\n\nHunter\n\nIn 1989, again under the Andrew Macdonald pen name, William Pierce published another novel, Hunter, which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War and an F-4 Phantom pilot who assassinates interracial couples and liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area.\n\nIn interviews, Pierce called Hunter more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"...an educational process\".\n\nReligion\n\nAlthough raised as a Presbyterian, Pierce became an atheist as a teenager. In the 1970s, however, Pierce created the religious philosophy of 'cosmotheism', based on a mixture of German romanticism, the Darwinian concept of natural selection, and Pierce's interpretation of George Bernard Shaw's play, Man and Superman. The Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center assert that Pierce created cosmotheism in order to acquire tax-exempt status for the National Alliance after he had failed to do so earlier, and the SPLC refers to it as a \"bogus religion\".\n\nIn effect, cosmotheism is a form of panentheism, asserting that \"all is within God and God is within all.\" It considers the nature of consciousness to be mutable and destined to evolve, via biological eugenics, towards a complete 'universal consciousness,' or godhood. The word cosmos means an orderly and harmonious universe. The purpose of cosmotheism, therefore, is the upwards-striving of biological life to ever higher forms of being.\n\nIn his speech \"Our Cause\", Pierce said:\n\nAll we require is that you share with us a commitment to the simple, but great, truth which I have explained to you here, that you understand that you are a part of the whole, which is the creator, that you understand that your purpose, the purpose of mankind and the purpose of every other part of creation, is the creator's purpose, that this purpose is the never-ending ascent of the path of creation, the path of life symbolized by our life rune, that you understand that this path leads ever upward toward the creator's self-realization, and that the destiny of those who follow this path is godhood.\n\nPierce described his form of panentheism as being based on \"[t]he idea of an evolutionary universe ... with an evolution toward ever higher and higher states of self-consciousness,\" and his political ideas were centered on racial purity and eugenics as the means of advancing the white race first towards a super race and then towards personal godhood. In his view, the white race represented the pinnacle of human evolution thus far and therefore it should be kept genetically separate from all other races, through racial segregation.\n\nPierce believed in a hierarchical society governed by what he saw as the essential principles of nature, and the survival of the fittest. He advocated white separatism, as, in his view, white people should remain separated from other races and establish a meritocracy. He thought that extensive programs of \"racial cleansing\" (mass expulsion) and eugenics, both in Europe and North America, would be necessary to achieve this socio-political program.\n\nFamily\n\nPierce married five times. His first marriage was to Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while attending California Institute of Technology. They were married in 1957, and had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. Kelvin is an aerospace engineer, while Erik is a computer scientist. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Pierce remarried that same year to Elizabeth Prostel, whom he met in the National Alliance office in Arlington, Virginia. The marriage ended in 1985, at which time Pierce moved his headquarters to Southern West Virginia. In the headquarters, Pierce acquired a Siamese cat, Hadley, which stayed with him until his death. In 1986, Pierce married Hungarian Olga Skerlecz, a relative of Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, Governor of Croatia-Slavonia, and the marriage lasted until 1990. Olga moved to California after their divorce. Pierce then married another Hungarian woman named Zsuzsannah in early 1991. They met through an advertisement that Pierce placed in a Hungarian women's magazine aimed at arranging international marriages. Zsuzsannah moved to Florida after their divorce in the summer of 1996. His final marriage, which lasted until his death, was to another Hungarian woman, Irena, whom he married in 1997."}]}
