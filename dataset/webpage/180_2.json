His WANFL career with West Perth comprised 180 games between 1939 and 1953, with a break for the war.\n\nIn 1941 he accomplished the rare feat of playing in two premiership sides in different states in the same season. Whilst temporarily stationed in Victoria, Heal lined up with Melbourne, and was on a wing as the Redlegs defeated Essendon in that year's VFL Grand Final. A week later he was back home in Perth completing the second half of an exceptional double as West Perth accounted for East Fremantle in the WANFL Grand Final. This time Heal played as a rover, but it was as a wingman that he achieved his greatest notoriety.\n\nThe West Perth teams of the half decade or so following World War II were among the finest in the club's history, and Heal was very much a lynch-pin, both as player and coach. He played in two premiership sides for the Cardinals, and won their fairest and best award in 1947. He coached the victorious Grand Final teams of 1949 against Perth and 1951 versus South Fremantle. Heal was also a regular interstate representative (18 appearances) winning a Simpson Medal against South Australia in 1949 and leading the Sandgropers at the Brisbane carnival the following year. In October 2000 he was named (more or less inevitably one ventures to presume) on a wing in West Perth official 'Team of the Century'.\n\nAuthor - John Devaney"}, {"url": "https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/wa/west-perth-wingman-stan-heal-inducted-into-afl-hall-of-fame-ng-addad495e4df9d61c3b92415fc743c1e", "page_content": "STAN \"Pops'' Heal will be remembered for his unique feat in 1941, when he played in two premiership teams in different states as a 21-year-old.\n\nThe dashing and fearless West Perth wingman, now 89, was last night inducted into the AFL Hall of Fame.\n\nHeal joined the navy in 1941 and was stationed in Fremantle until July and getting weekends off he was able to continue playing for West Perth.\n\nA transfer to Flinders Naval Depot in Melbourne made him a sought-after VFL recruit and Heal signed for Melbourne where he played eight games to bolster a side that had been ravaged by the war.\n\nHeal played in the Demons' 29-point Grand Final win over Essendon to complete Melbourne's hat-trick before fate ensured he would claim another premiership cup in the WANFL for West Perth over East Fremantle a week later.\n\n\"My course finished on the Friday and I played in the Grand Final on the Saturday with Melbourne, and then I was transferred back to Fremantle on the Monday,'' he said.\n\n\"I arrived back on the Thursday and West Perth happened to be playing in the Grand Final the following weekend. They had a few injuries so they asked me would I like a game and I said `yeah'.''\n\nThe war cost Heal four seasons of what would have been his prime, but he returned to West Perth in 1946 and became a legend of the club and of WA football.\n\nHe played 180 games for West Perth during the club's golden era and captain-coached the club to five Grand Finals and two flags.\n\nThe WA Football Hall of Fame legend also excelled for his state, playing 18 games for WA, winning the Simpson Medal in 1949 and leading his state in the 1950 carnival.\n\nAlong with his dream double-premiership week, Heal rates WA's win over Victoria in 1947 in Hobart and West Perth's surprise 1951 Grand Final triumph as major highlights.\n\nHeal said his induction gave some recognition to an era of WA football that had been largely overlooked and he was proud to accept it on behalf of a group of teammates who included fellow champions Ray Schofield, John Loughridge and Ray Scott.\n\n\"I'm very honoured. It's good for WA football and good for the West Perth club to get people nominated into any Hall of Fame,'' he said.\n\n\"WA has got a great history. It defeated Victoria a few times and most of the WA footballers who have gone to Victoria have always done very well.\n\n\"Every footballer's ambition was to play club football and get selected for your state. That was the highest honour you could have.\n\n\"I think they should have kept it going, and maybe kept the carnivals going. They were the highlights, the carnivals.''\n\nHeal said he still enjoyed modern football but preferred the game-style of his era.\n\n\"It will always always be a great game, but for me I'd rather see the old style. The longer-kicking and less handball and more position play,'' he said.\n\n\"All the players are up in one half of the ground. I try to work out the game plans but it's beyond me. Football has made more change than other sports in that regard.''\n\nSubscribe to our Email Newsletter"}, {"url": "https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/heal-story-really-was-the-stuff-of-legend-ng-ya-187598", "page_content": "Football romantics, hard-core statisticians, historians and icon worshippers paid tributes on both sides of Australia yesterday after the passing of a man known universally as Pops.\n\nStan \"Pops\" Heal, who died early yesterday aged 90, was all things to the game from when he first played for West Perth at senior level four months before the outbreak of World War II until 1952, when he retired as captain-coach of the club.\n\nThose times bookend an extraordinary career, intertwined with naval service during the war, which incorporated the remarkable feat of winning two premierships in a week in 1941 - with Melbourne in the then VFL and West Perth, where he played 180 games.\n\nIn Victoria to continue his naval training in 1941, the gifted wingman walked into a Melbourne team which had won the previous two flags, playing every second week before the grand final in which he was listed as one of the Demons' best.\n\nHe played only eight games for the club, but his unique story prompted Melbourne CEO Cameron Schwab to fly Heal to Victoria this year for a special Foundations Hero night when the Demons' new emblem was revealed.\n\nHeal's history was included as one of six players who helped define the club, along with the paths taken by Robbie Flower, Ron Barassi, Jim Stynes, Liam Jurrah and David Neitz, the first and only Demon to notch 300 games.\n\n\"It was fitting for Melbourne to get Pops to play because the club lost 21 players to wars, and this time the war brought one to us,\" Schwab said. \"I found him a totally engaging and charismatic man, and very, very modest.\"\n\nNoted WA and West Perth historian Brian Atkinson said football's production line no longer churned out players or men such as Heal, who this year joined the AFL's Hall of Fame after already being inducted as one of only 12 legends in the WA Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\"There is no doubt at all that Popsie was the greatest name in the history of the West Perth footy club,\" Atkinson said. \"Nobody could ever mount an argument that there's been a greater name in the club's history.\"\n\nWest Perth CEO Gerry O'Dea, who engineered the naming of the Stan Pops Heal Coaches' Box at the club's ground at Joondalup this year, said the club had lost a legend.\n\n\"The word is bandied about a bit these days but Pops was an absolute hero of this football club and had the respect of everybody.

Sure, being tall is advantageous in many situations, but size alone doesn\u2019t make someone an elite player.\n\nList of NBA guards that are 6\u20193\n\nHere is a big list of some of the best NBA guards that are 6\u20193 in alphabetical order:\n\nAnfernee Simons\n\nC.J.

Yes, although a pretty tall height in general, 6\u20193 is short for the NBA because it\u2019s around 3 inches below the average height.\n\nThe majority of NBA players are taller than 6 foot 3, but some of the best players are 6\u20193 and under, so it\u2019s not like being tall automatically makes you more skillful.\n\nAdditionally, 6 foot 3 NBA players tend to be guards and have excellent ball handling abilities. So in this sense, if they\u2019re great at getting their team into offense, it\u2019s not like they need to be really tall.\n\nObviously, some coaches and fans are still stuck on the mindset that only tall guys can play basketball.\n\nIf you encounter a person who thinks this way, simply show them the extensive list of 6 3 NBA players to prove that height isn\u2019t necessarily a barrier to NBA success and stardom.\n\nHow disadvantaged are 6\u20193 NBA players?\n\nWhile the sport of basketball in general and the NBA in particular naturally attracts a lot of tall athletes, you don\u2019t need to be tall to find sporting success in the NBA.\n\nImagine if the best 6\u20193 NBA players had said to themselves that they were too short to play basketball; they would never have gotten off the ground!\n\nOn the contrary, some of the best NBA players of all time, irrespective of their height, are those who believed in themselves and their abilities and had positive influences around them.\n\nObviously, if you\u2019re a 6\u20193 basketball player who\u2019s still in high school, then you might get taller, meaning that you may end up playing a different position or changing your game to fit your developing physique.\n\nAnother good tip for shorter players is to put in more gym time. By having more muscle mass than your taller opponents, you won\u2019t get out muscled as often, and you\u2019ll have a bigger physical presence on the court, allowing you to be more explosive.\n\nThe verdict: What do the best 6\u20193 basketball players have in common?\n\nThe best 6 3 NBA players all share a common belief in their own skill set. This intrinsic self-motivation allows them to train with confidence that their efforts won\u2019t be in vain just because they\u2019re 6 foot 3.\n\nAs with any height, there are obviously plenty of 6 foot 3 basketball players who don\u2019t make the NBA. Yet, the most skillful ones do. So don\u2019t let your height dictate your basketball career.\n\nReferences"}, {"url": "https://www.wafootballhalloffame.com.au/inductees/6ecd5a20-4be1-11e9-abed-e964c3fd662e_stanley-heal", "page_content": "PLAYER: 1939-53\n\nGAMES: 206: West Perth 180; WA 18; Melbourne 8\n\nPREMIERSHIPS: West Perth 1941, captain-coach 49, 51; Melbourne 1941\n\nHONOURS: Coach of West Perth from 1947-52; Simpson Medal 1949; WA captain 1946, 51; WA captain-coach 1950; West Perth fairest and best 1947;\n\nLike many great players of this era, Stan Heal\u2019s record would have been even better but for World War II which restricted him to 28 games in six seasons.
