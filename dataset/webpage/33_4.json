{"The Blood Divine is also seen as a symbol of the unity of the Church, as it is believed to be shared by all believers.": [{"url": "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-Christianity", "page_content": "Trinity, in Christian doctrine, the unity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead. The doctrine of the Trinity is considered to be one of the central Christian affirmations about God. It is rooted in the fact that God came to meet Christians in a threefold figure: (1) as Creator, Lord of the history of salvation, Father, and Judge, as revealed in the Old Testament; (2) as the Lord who, in the incarnated figure of Jesus Christ, lived among human beings and was present in their midst as the \u201cResurrected One\u201d; and (3) as the Holy Spirit, whom they experienced as the helper or intercessor in the power of the new life.\n\nNeither the word \u201cTrinity\u201d nor the explicit doctrine appears in the New Testament, nor did Jesus and his followers intend to contradict the Shema in the Hebrew Scriptures: \u201cHear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord\u201d (Deuteronomy 6:4). The earliest Christians, however, had to cope with the implications of the coming of Jesus Christ and of the presumed presence and power of God among them\u2014i.e., the Holy Spirit, whose coming was connected with the celebration of Pentecost. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were associated in such New Testament passages as the Great Commission: \u201cGo therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit\u201d (Matthew 28:19); and in the apostolic benediction: \u201cThe grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all\u201d (2 Corinthians 13:13). Thus, the New Testament established the basis for the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nMore From Britannica Christianity: The Holy Trinity\n\nThe doctrine developed gradually over several centuries and through many controversies. Initially, both the requirements of monotheism inherited from the Hebrew Scriptures and the implications of the need to interpret the biblical teaching to Greco-Roman religions seemed to demand that the divine in Christ as the Word, or Logos, be interpreted as subordinate to the Supreme Being. An alternative solution was to interpret Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as three modes of the self-disclosure of the one God but not as distinct within the being of God itself. The first tendency recognized the distinctness among the three, but at the cost of their equality and hence of their unity (subordinationism). The second came to terms with their unity, but at the cost of their distinctness as \u201cpersons\u201d (modalism). The high point of these conflicts was the so-called Arian controversy in the early 4th century. In his interpretation of the idea of God, Arius sought to maintain a formal understanding of the oneness of God. In defense of that oneness, he was obliged to dispute the sameness of essence of the Son and the Holy Spirit with God the Father. It was not until later in the 4th century that the distinctness of the three and their unity were brought together in a single orthodox doctrine of one essence and three persons.\n\nThe Council of Nicaea in 325 stated the crucial formula for that doctrine in its confession that the Son is \u201cof the same substance [homoousios] as the Father,\u201d even though it said very little about the Holy Spirit. Over the next half century, St. Athanasius defended and refined the Nicene formula, and, by the end of the 4th century, under the leadership of St. Basil of Caesarea, St. Gregory of Nyssa, and St. Gregory of Nazianzus (the Cappadocian Fathers), the doctrine of the Trinity took substantially the form it has maintained ever since. It is accepted in all of the historic confessions of Christianity, even though the impact of the Enlightenment decreased its importance in some traditions."}, {"url": "https://www.togetheratonealtar.catholic.edu.au/craft/signs-and-symbols/", "page_content": "The \u2018language\u2019 of Symbols\n\nAs a Church we have a \u2018language\u2019 that helps us put expression to the moments of grace that mark our lives. This language is expressed in symbols and rituals (which are beyond words) and also, of course, in words that help us communicate the mystery of our relationship with the Divine. This is the language of the liturgy. Let\u2019s look at a few of these symbols:\n\n\n\nLaying on of Hands\n\nOne of the primary symbols in the liturgy is the \u2018laying on of hands\u2019. From ancient times, to impose hands on someone or to extend one\u2019s hand over the person\u2019s head was the sign of calling down the Holy Spirit. All seven sacraments employ this symbol. We call the prayer which accompanies the imposition of hands an epiclesis, which is an invocation. In the Eucharist, the priest stretches his hands over the bread and wine to call upon the Holy Spirit to consecrate these gifts into the body and blood of Christ.\n\n\n\nBread and Wine\n\nWheat is grown and ground, transformed by human work to make bread. Grapes are grown and crushed, transformed by human work to make wine. It is traditionally the work of human hands.\n\nBread is life. Wine is joy. The sharing of food and drink is often linked with peace-making and the resolution of differences. From the earliest times, human beings have shared meals together. The very act of eating and drinking together is a symbol of fellowship, common life, common love.\n\nIn biblical times, people ate everything from the same plate. People ate using flat bread which served as a \u2018spoon\u2019 dipped into the communal dish. Sharing food in this way increased the sense of solidarity and fellowship among those eating it. They became, in a sense, one body.\n\nThe breaking of the bread was the ritual gesture that established communion among those at table in a Jewish ritual meal. The Last Supper was such a meal. Jesus identified the broken bread and poured wine with his own Body and Blood, broken and poured out in his suffering and Death. After his Resurrection, Jesus\u2019 disciples spoke of recognising him in the \u2018breaking of the bread\u2019. The \u2018breaking of the bread\u2019 eventually came to describe the whole action of the Eucharist after the time of Jesus."}, {"url": "https://sodaliteminds.com/blood-symbolism/", "page_content": "Blood symbolism may make you squeamish, but the reality is that it\u2019s played an incredibly important role in human culture throughout history.\n\nBlood is one of the most powerful symbols in the world.

Perhaps their most spectacular discovery was that musical harmony is related to simple whole-number ratios. A string (such as that on a violin) produces a note with a particular pitch ; a string one-half as long produces an extremely harmonious note to the first, now called the octave. A string two-thirds as long produces the next most harmonious note, now called the fifth. And one three-fourths as long produces the fourth, also very harmonious. The Pythagoreans discovered these facts empirically by experimenting with strings of different lengths. Today these harmonies are traced to the physics of vibrating strings, which move in patterns of waves. The number of waves that can fit into a given length of string is a whole number, and these whole numbers determine the simple numerical ratios. When the numbers do not form a simple ratio, the corresponding notes interfere with each other and form discordant \u201cbeats\u201d that are unpleasant to the ear. The full story is more complex, involving what the brain becomes accustomed to, but there is a definite rationale behind the Pythagorean discovery. This later led the German astronomer Johannes Kepler to the concept of the \u201cmusic of the spheres,\u201d a kind of heavenly harmony in which the planets effectively produced tunes as they moved across the heavens. Some of Kepler\u2019s theories about the planets, such as the elliptical shape of their orbits, became solid science\u2014but not this one. Nonetheless, it was influential in establishing the view that there is some kind of order in the cosmos, an idea that culminated in Isaac Newton \u2019s law of gravity .\n\nSome Pythagorean speculations were mathematical. They represented numbers by arrangements of dots. The square numbers (1, 4, 9, 16,\u2026) were arranged in squares, and the triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10,\u2026) were arranged in triangles (see figure). This terminology remains in use to the present day.\n\nThe Pythagoreans recognized the existence of nine heavenly bodies: Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the so-called Central Fire. So important was the number 10 in their view of cosmology that they believed there was a tenth body, Counter-Earth, perpetually hidden from us by the Sun.\n\nThe Pythagoreans invested specific numbers with mystical properties. The number 1 symbolized unity and the origin of all things, since all other numbers can be created from 1 by adding enough copies of it. For example, 7 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. The number 2 was symbolic of the female principle, 3 of the male; they come together in 2 + 3 = 5 as marriage. All even numbers were female, all odd numbers male. The number 4 represented justice . The most perfect number was 10 , because 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4. This number symbolized unity arising from multiplicity. Moreover, it was related to space. A single point corresponds to 1, a line to 2 (because a line has two extremities), a triangle to 3, and space to 4. Thus 10 also symbolized all possible spaces.\n\nThe earliest known systematic cult based on the rule of numbers was that of the Pythagoreans . Pythagoras was a Greek who thrived in the 6th century bce. Little is known of his life, and in fact he may be a composite figure to whom the discoveries of many different people have been attributed by his followers. It is not even known whether the Pythagorean theorem in geometry was actually discovered by him.\n\nCultural associations of some numbers\n\nThe enormous range of symbolic roles that numbers have played in various cultures, religions, and other systems of human thought can be gauged from a brief sample.\n\n1 Not surprisingly, the number 1 is generally treated as a symbol of unity. Therefore, in monotheistic religions, it often symbolizes God or the universe. The Pythagoreans did not consider 1 to be a number at all because number means plurality and 1 is singular. However, they considered it to be the source of all numbers because adding many 1s together can create any other (positive whole) number. In their system, where odd numbers were male and even numbers female, the number 1 was neither; instead, it changed each to the other. If 1 is added to an even number, it becomes odd; similarly, if 1 is added to an odd number, it becomes even.\n\n2 yin and yang symbol The number 2 symbolizes many of the basic dualities: me/you, male/female, yes/no, alive/dead, left/right, yin/yang, and so on. Dualities are common in human approaches to the world, probably because of our preference for two-valued logic\u2014yet another duality, true/false. Although 2 was female to the Pythagoreans, other numerological schemes viewed it as male. In Agrippa von Nettesheim\u2019s De occulta philosophia (1533; \u201cOn the Philosophy of the Occult\u201d), 2 is the symbol for man, sex, and evil. One reason that some have associated 2 with evil is that the biblical book of Genesis does not use the formula \u201cand it was good\u201d when referring to the second day of Creation. Some religions are dualistic, with two gods in place of the one God of monotheism. Examples include Zoroastrianism, where Ahura Mazd\u0101 (the god of light and goodness) battles with Ahriman (the god of darkness and evil). The number 2 is often associated with negatives, as in the words duplicity and two-faced. Northwest Coast Indians required the parents of twins to observe various taboos because they believed that supernatural powers would bring the wishes of twins to fruition.\n\n3 The number 3 is a very mystical and spiritual number featured in many folktales (three wishes, three guesses, three little pigs, three bears, three billy goats gruff). In ancient Babylon the three primary gods were Anu, Bel (Baal), and Ea, representing Heaven, Earth, and the Abyss. Similarly, there were three aspects to the Egyptian sun god: Khepri (rising), Re (midday), and Atum (setting). In Christianity there is the Trinity of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. Plato saw 3 as being symbolic of the triangle, the simplest spatial shape, and considered the world to have been built from triangles. In German folklore a paper triangle with a cross in each corner and a prayer in the middle was thought to act as protection against gout, as well as protecting a cradle from witches. Three black animals were often sacrificed when attempting to conjure up demons. On the other hand, a three-coloured cat was a protective spirit. In William Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth (1606\u201307) there are three witches, and their spell begins, \u201cThrice the brindled cat hath mewed,\u201d reflecting such superstitions. Also, 3 is the dimension of the smallest magic square in which every row, column, and diagonal sums to 15.\n\n4 The number of order in the universe is 4\u2014the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water; the four seasons; the four points of the compass; the four phases of the Moon (new, half-moon waxing, full, half-moon waning). The Four Noble Truths epitomize Buddhism. To the Pythagoreans 4 was the source of the tetractys 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, the most perfect number. In medieval times there were thought to be four humours (phlegm, blood, choler, and black bile\u2014hence the adjectives phlegmatic, sanguine, choleric, and melancholic), and the body was bled at various places to bring these humours into balance. The number 4 is central in the world view of the Sioux, with four groups of gods (superior, ally, subordinate, and spirit), four types of animal (creeping, flying, four-legged, and two-legged), and four ages of humans (infant, child, mature, and elderly). Their medicine men instructed them to carry out all activities in groups of four. Because 4 is generally a practical, material number, few superstitions are associated with it. An exception is in China, where 4 is unlucky because she (\u201cfour\u201d) and shi (\u201cdeath\u201d) sound similar. In the biblical Revelation to John the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse wreak destruction upon humanity.\n\n5 The sum of the first even and odd numbers (2 + 3) is 5. (To the Pythagoreans 1 was not a number and was not odd.) It therefore symbolizes human life and\u2014in the Platonic and Pythagorean traditions\u2014marriage, as the sum of the female 2 and the male 3. The Pythagoreans discovered the five regular solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron; now known as the Platonic solids). Early Pythagoreanism acknowledged only four of these, so the discovery of the fifth (the dodecahedron, with 12 pentagonal faces) was something of an embarrassment. Perhaps for this reason 5 was often considered exotic and rebellious. The number 5 was associated with the Babylonian goddess Ishtar and her Roman parallel, Venus, and the symbol for both was the five-pointed star, or pentagram. In England a knot tied in the form of the pentagram is called a lover\u2019s knot because of this association with the goddess of love. In Manichaeism 5 has a central position: the first man had five sons; there are five elements of light (ether, wind, water, light, and fire) and a further five of darkness. The body has five parts; there are five virtues and five vices. The number 5 was also important to the Maya, who placed a fifth point at the centre of the four points of the compass. The five fingers of the human hand lent a certain mystery to 5, as did the five extremities of the body (two arms, two legs, head). A human placed in a circle with outspread arms and legs approximates the five points of a pentagon, and if each point is joined to its second nearest neighbour, a pentagram results. This geometric figure is central to occultism, and it plays a prominent role in summoning spells whereby it is supposed to trap a demon, or devil, who can then be compelled to do the sorcerer\u2019s bidding. The belief that 5 was sacred led to an extra element, augmenting the traditional four that made a human being. This fifth essence, or quintessence, is the origin of the word quintessential. In Islam 5 is a sacred number. Foremost are the five Pillars of Islam: declaration of faith (shah\u0101dah), prayer (\u1e63al\u0101t), fasting during Ramadan, giving alms (zak\u0101t), and making the pilgrimage to Mecca (the hajj). Prayers are said five times every day. There are five categories of Islamic law and five law-giving prophets (Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad)."}, {"url": "https://russianicon.com/the-holy-trinity-as-a-symbol-for-the-unity-of-god/", "page_content": "June 20, 2021\n\nThe Holy Trinity as a Symbol for the Unity of God\n\nToday, all Orthodox believers celebrate the great Trinity Sunday. It should be noted that the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is given almost the highest attention in Christianity. It is the Trinitarian nature of God that distinguishes this religion from the rest. The Holy Trinity as a symbol for the unity of God has its representation in both Orthodox icons and Christian art overall. But what does this sacred symbol actually mean? And why is it still a mystery even to some Christian believers?\n\nThe feast of the Holy Trinity\n\nThe feast of the Holy Trinity is one of the most beloved feasts among Orthodox believers. However, the true history of its origin is still obscure. According to Christian teachings, on this day, God created the land and plants. Therefore, it is believed that the greenery in the house on the Trinity is a protection against the evil eye. According to another belief, on this day, Jesus and His disciples sat down under a green tree to have a rest. Perhaps, this is where the Trinity Sunday came from. But the primary meaning of the celebration lies in the church\u2019s ancient belief in the unity of God\u2019s essence.\n\nThe Holy Trinity as a symbol for the unity of God\n\nAccording to the New Testament, God is represented in three hypostases: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. However, they are not three Gods. The Lord is the unity of three essences that are of the same divine nature.\n\nThe symbols of the Trinity in iconography and art are the hand (God the Father), the lamb (God the Son), and the dove (the Holy Spirit). Another ancient symbol of the Holy Trinity is the triangle, which shows that all three entities are equal and represent the unity of God. Sometimes, the symbol of three intertwined fishes can be seen in church depictions. It also refers us to the Holy Trinity.\n\nIn Orthodox icons and religious paintings, the Holy Trinity as a symbol of the unity of God is not shown that often. However, there are still icons depicting the Father with a halo over His head in the center, the Son often in the form of a lamb or a cross on the right side, and the Holy Spirit as a dove spreading the wings.\n\nThe Holy Trinity as a symbol of God\u2019s unity is an important part of Christian teachings. You should definitely learn more about it if you want to understand the Christian faith and traditions better."}, {"url": "https://symbolsage.com/symbols-of-unity-a-list/", "page_content": "Home \u00bb Information 12 Popular Symbols of Unity and Their Meanings 12 Popular Symbols of Unity and Their Meanings Dani Rhys\n\nAffiliate Disclosures\n\nUnity is one of the keys to maintaining lasting harmony and peace. As the famous quote goes, \u201cWe\u2019re only as strong as we\u2019re united, as weak as we\u2019re divided\u201d.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at the different symbols of unity, and how they helped bind different groups together toward a common goal.\n\n1. Number 1\n\nThe Pythagoreans gave certain numbers mystical significance\u2014and the number 1 became their symbol of unity. It was regarded as the origin of all things since all other numbers can be created from it.\n\nIn their system, odd numbers were male and even numbers female, but the number 1 was neither. In fact, adding 1 to any odd number makes it even, and vice versa.\n\n2. Circle\n\nOne of the oldest symbols in the world, the circle became associated with unity, completeness, eternity, and perfection.\n\nIn fact, most traditions, such as talking circles or peacemaking circles, were derived from their symbolism. In some religions, believers would gather in a circle to pray, which is called a prayer circle.\n\nCircles bring individuals together in a way that creates trust, respect, and intimacy. By forming a circle, people create a sense of unity, where participants can share and hear stories.\n\n3. Ouroboros\n\nAn alchemical and gnostic symbol, the Ouroboros depicts a snake or a dragon with its tail in its mouth, continuously devouring itself and being reborn from itself.\n\nIt\u2019s a positive symbol that represents the unity of all things and the cyclic nature of the universe.\n\nThe word Ouroboros originated from the Greek that means tail-devourer, but its representations can be traced back to ancient Egypt, around the 13th and 14th centuries BCE.\n\n4. Odal Rune\n\nAlso called Othala or Ethel, the Odal Rune is part of the alphabet used by Germanic peoples from Scandinavia, Iceland, Britain, and northern Europe from the 3rd century to the 17th century CE.\n\nCorresponding to the o sound, it\u2019s the symbol of family unity, togetherness, and belonging, often used in magic to promote harmonious family relationships.\n\nThe Odal Rune is also regarded as the rune of heritage, which could refer to the literal ancestral land of the family.\n\nIn ancient Scandinavia, properties had to be passed down from generation to generation, in order to keep families and cultural traditions rooted in place.\n\nIn modern interpretations, it can also represent the intangible things we inherit from our family.\n\n5. Iodhadh\n\nThe ancient Celts used ogham sigils to symbolize certain shrubs and trees. Eventually, these sigils developed into letters, used from the 4th to the 10th century CE.\n\nThe 20th ogham letter, Iodhadh stands for the unity of death and life and corresponds to the yew tree.\n\nThroughout Europe, the yew is the longest-living tree and became sacred to various divinities like Hecate. It\u2019s said that the symbol represents the dual nature of endings and beginnings at the same time.\n\n6. Tudor Rose\n\nA symbol of unity after wars, the Tudor Rose was created by Henry VII of England to represent the unification of the royal houses of Lancaster and York.\n\nThe Wars of the Roses were a series of civil wars fought over the English throne from 1455 to 1485, preceding the government of the Tudors. Both royal families claimed the throne through descent from the sons of Edward III.\n\nThe wars earned its name because each house had its own emblem: the Red Rose of Lancaster and the White Rose of York.\n\nWhen Richard III, the last king of the House of York, was killed by the Lancastrian Henry Tudor in the battle, the latter was declared King Henry VII. After his coronation, the king married Elizabeth of York.\n\nTheir marriage ended the wars between the two royal families and gave rise to the Tudor Dynasty. Henry VII introduced the Tudor Rose, merging the heraldic badges of Lancaster and York.\n\nThe Tudor Rose, recognized by its both red and white colors, was adopted as the national emblem of England, and a symbol of unity and peace.\n\n7. The Cross of Lorraine\n\nThe Cross of Lorraine features a double-barred cross, somewhat similar to the patriarchal cross. In the First Crusade, a double-barred cross of this kind was used by Godefroy de Bouillon, the Duke of Lorraine, in his standard when he took part in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.\n\nEventually, the symbol was passed down to his successors as heraldic arms.\n\nIn the 15th century, the Duke of Anjou used the cross to represent the national unity of France, and it became known as the cross of Lorraine.\n\nEventually, the cross of Lorraine evolved into a symbol of patriotism and freedom.\n\nDuring World War II, it was used by General Charles de Gaulle as a symbol of French resistance against Germany.\n\nIt became linked to the French heroine Joan of Arc, whose origin was in the province of Lorraine. Today, the symbol is commonly seen on many French war memorials.\n\n8. The Northern Knot\n\nIn Northern Nigeria, the Northern Knot is a representation of unity in diversity. It was adopted by politicians, including Alhaji Ahmadu Bello, when the Nigerians were preparing for political independence from Britain.\n\nIt has been used as a design element in their currency, coat of arms, paintings, and walls of both the old and new palaces.\n\n9. Raised Fist\n\nThe raised fist is common in protests, representing themes such as unity, defiance, and power. As a symbol of political solidarity, it\u2019s significant to people who have made a commitment to challenge a situation of injustice.\n\nIn The Uprising by Honor\u00e9 Daumier, the raised fist symbolized the fighting spirit of the revolutionaries against the European monarchies during the French revolution in 1848.\n\nLater, the raised fist was adopted by the anti-fascist movement in Europe.\n\nDuring the Spanish Civil War, it was used to represent the Republican government\u2019s opposition to the future dictator Francisco Franco.\n\nFor the Spanish Republic, it\u2019s a salute of solidarity with the democratic peoples of the world. The gesture became associated with the Black Power movement in the 1960s.\n\n10. The Masonic Trowel\n\nA symbol of Freemasonry\u2019s unity, the Masonic trowel cements brotherhood among men.\n\nThe trowel is a tool used to spread cement or mortar, which binds the bricks of a building. In a figurative sense, a Mason is a builder of the brotherhood, who spreads brotherly love and affection.\n\nThe Masonic trowel serves as a reminder to spread the moral cement in their daily lives, uniting separate minds and interests. The symbol is commonly featured in Masonic jewels, lapel pins, insignias, and rings.\n\n11. Borromean Rings\n\nThe Borromean Rings consist of three interlocking rings\u2014sometimes triangles or rectangles\u2014that cannot be separated.\n\nThe symbol is named after the Borromeo family of Italy who used it on their coat of arms.\n\nSince the three rings are strong together, yet fall apart if one of them is removed, the Borromean rings signify strength in unity.\n\n12. M\u00f6bius Strip\n\nSince its discovery in 1858, the M\u00f6bius strip has fascinated mathematicians, philosophers, artists, and engineers.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s an infinite loop with a one-sided surface, which cannot be defined as internal or external.\n\nDue to this, it\u2019s seen as a symbol of unity, oneness, and solidarity, as whichever side of the M\u00f6bius you start on, or what direction you go, you\u2019ll always end up on the same path.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAs we have seen, these symbols of unity are significant as representations of oneness towards a common goal.\n\nThe circle has been a universal symbol of unity that transcends different cultures and religions, while others serve as a representation of family unity, political unity, and unity in diversity in specific regions.\n\nSimilar Articles:\n\n15 Powerful Symbols of Life (And What They Mean)\n\n10 Powerful Eternity & Immortality Symbols (With Meanings)\n\n12 Symbols That Represent Freedom (And Their Origins)\n\n15 Powerful Symbols of Hope and What They Stand For"}, {"url": "https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/what-is-the-meaning-of-water-and-blood-in-1-john-56", "page_content": "Forgive me for quoting extensively from The Mystery of God: Early Jewish Mysticism and the New Testament. It's the only book I've found in more than 15 years of studying the writings of John which so clearly gets the water and blood right.\n\nThe Standard View: Water and Blood as Baptism and Death\n\nIt is tempting to suppose that the reference to water in this passage is a reference to Jesus' baptism and the blood to his death on the cross. In that case, it would appear that we have a repudiation of a Christology which asserted that only the baptism, and not the suffering of the cross, was part of the coming of Christ.\n\nThis is a very common view. Here's how the New Living Translation \"translates\" this passage, \"And Jesus Christ was revealed as God's Son by his baptism in water and by shedding his blood on the cross - not by water only, but by water and blood.\n\nPut like this, the similarities with Gnostic Cerinthus' teaching seem very marked indeed (see Irenaeus, Haer. 1.26). After all, according to Irenaeus, Cerinthus believed that Christ descended in the form of a dove, but departed from him, so that only the human Jesus suffered and rose again, while the divine Christ remained impassable. 1 John 5:6 would seem to indicate that the false teachers accepted the presence of the heavenly Christ at baptism but not at the crucifixion.\n\nIrenaus in his second century work Against Heresies mentions the teaching of one Cerinthus. \"Cerinthus, again, a man who was educated in the wisdom of the Egyptians, taught that the world was not made by the primary God, but by a certain Power far separated from him, and at a distance from that Principality who is supreme over the universe, and ignorant of him who is above all. He represented Jesus as having not been born of a virgin, but as being the son of Joseph and Mary according to the ordinary course of human generation, while he nevertheless was more righteous, prudent, and wise than other men. Moreover, after his baptism, Christ descended upon him in the form of a dove from the Supreme Ruler, and that then he proclaimed the unknown Father, and performed miracles. But at last Christ departed from Jesus, and that then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained impassible, inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.\"\n\nIrenaus also records an antagonism between John and Cerinthus through an anecdote of Polycarp's, the disciple of John. \"There are also those who heard from him (Polycarp) that John, the disciple of the Lord, going to bathe at Ephesus, and perceiving Cerinthus within, rushed out of the bath-house without bathing, exclaiming, \u201cLet us fly, lest even the bath-house fall down, because Cerinthus, the enemy of the truth, is within.\u201d\n\nProblems with Water and Blood Referring to Baptism and the Cross\n\nBut there's several problem's with this interpretation.\n\nFirst of all, it is by no means obvious that the coming of Christ spoken of in 1 John refers to the events which characterized his life as a whole but speak rather of the mode of his coming (i.e. his incarnation, the reality of his humanity). This seems to be the case in 1 John 4:2 and 2 John 7, where the coming on both occasions is linked explicitly with the humanity of Jesus.\n\n1 John 4:2 states, \"by this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God.\" 2 John 7 reads, \"For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh.\"\n\nA more natural explanation of 5:6, therefore, is to suppose that the water and the blood refer to the nature of the incarnate Christ rather than events in his life. This is a view which would seem to be confirmed by the passage in John 19:34, which seems to parallel 1 John 5:6.\n\nJohn 19:34, the only mention of blood in the crucifixion is an element of Christ's body and not simply the representation of an event. It says, \"But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.\"\n\nThe point is further supported by a study of blood in the writings John. Though the only reference to blood in John (1:7) may seem to point to the event of Jesus crucifixion its more likely that it refers to the physical nature of his sacrifice. In the gospel of John (specifically 1:13, 6:53) blood and flesh have a synonymous meaning.\n\nSecondly, the other passage dealing with the false teaching in 4:2 is not so easy to interpret in the light of the teaching of Cerinthus as many have supposed. The issue here, and for that matter also in 2 John 7, is not the extent of the presence of the heavenly Christ throughout the life of Jesus of Nazareth, but the reality of the humanity of Jesus Christ. There seems to be no question here of the problem of a separation between the divine Christ and the humanity of Jesus. Rather, the author of 1 John repudiates the views of the those who reject the reality of the incarnation. This was not, as far as one can ascertain, part of Cerinthus's Christology. Thus, if we start with 4:2 as a summary of the Christology of the false teachers, we are driven to conclude that the issue was the reality of the humanity of Jesus Christ.\n\nSo what then does the water mean?\n\nBlood and Water as the Human and Divine Natures of Christ.\n\nHow then are we to understand 5:6 in this light? Is this a separate christological deviation, or can it be related to the other aspects of the false teachings? The reference in 1 John 5:6 is not to events in Jesus' life but an affirmation of the reality of the incarnation by pointing out the character of Jesus' nature, in much the same way as the parallel passage in John 19:34. This view has the advantage of being consistent with 1 John 4:2 and 2 John 7. There are two further factors to be borne in mind when interpreting the passage in the latter way, either the reference to water and blood could reflect ancient beliefs about human beings, or the water and the blood could represent the two aspects of Jesus' nature, the water the divine, the blood the human. The second alternative fits better with the fact that the writer wants to deny a view that Jesus Christ came by water only, an idea which is not completely comprehensible if this passage is merely about the make-up of humans. Emphasis on blood as a sign of the reality of the incarnation is found also in Ignatius, Smyrn. 6, and such an emphasis contrasts with those who deny the reality of his humanity by suggesting that the body of Jesus was made up of some other substance.\n\nIgnatius in his letter says, \"Let no man be deceived. Even the heavenly powers and the glory of the angels and the principalities both visible and invible, except they believe in the blood of Christ.\" In speaking of those who deny this he goes on to state, \"They have no thought for love, nor for widow, the orphan, the afflicted, the prisoner, the hungry nor the thirsty. They withhold themselves from Communion and prayer, because they confess not that communion is the flesh of our Savior Jesus Christ, which flesh suffered for our sins, and which in His loving-kindness the Father raised up.\"\n\nWengst rightly points out the difficulty of finding examples of Gnostic teachers who considered that Jesus was made up of a watery substance, without any human blood. There is some evidence, however, to suggest that some later Gnostics did think of Christ as consisting of an ethereal substance (Tertullian, De carne Christi 6 and Adv. Marc. 3.11).\n\nTertullian states, \"Thus the official record of both substances represents him as both man and God: on the one hand born, on the other not born: on the one hand fleshly, on the other spiritual: on the one hand weak, on the other exceeding strong: on the one hand dying, on the other living. That these two sets of attributes, the divine and the human, are each kept distinct from the other, is of course accounted for by the equal verity of each nature, both flesh and spirit being in full degree what they claim to be: the powers of the Spirit of God proved Him God, the sufferings proved there was the flesh of man.\"\n\nIndeed, in a passage which explicitly quoted John 19:34, Origen himself seems to make a similar point against celsus in Contra Celsum 2.36. In this passage Origen sees the water which flowed from the side of the crucified Jesus as a miraculous indication of his divinity.\n\nCelsus had asked, \"What is the nature of the ichor in the body of the crucified Jesus? Is it such as flows in the bodies of the immortal god's\". Celsus had drawn this conclusion in part from the Illiad, where Homer states concerning the wounding of Aphrodite, \"and blood immortal flowed from the goddess, ichor, that which funds in the veins of the blessed divinities; since these eat no food, nor do they drink of the shinning wine, and therefore they have no blood and are called immortal.' As these authors say, Origen counters Celsus' spirit of mockery but does not deny that the water is a representation of Christ's diety."}, {"url": "https://www.ashleydanyew.com/posts/signs-symbols-of-the-church-and-what-they-mean", "page_content": "Flame\n\nThe flame is often representative of the Holy Spirit, based on the Pentecost story in Acts 2:\n\n\"When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.

She was essentially urban and civilized, the antithesis in many respects of Artemis, goddess of the outdoors. Athena was probably a pre-Hellenic goddess and was later taken over by the Greeks. Yet the Greek economy, unlike that of the Minoans, was largely military, so that Athena, while retaining her earlier domestic functions, became a goddess of war.\n\nShe was the daughter of Zeus, produced without a mother, so that she emerged full-grown from his forehead. There was an alternative story that Zeus swallowed Metis, the goddess of counsel, while she was pregnant with Athena, so that Athena finally emerged from Zeus. Being the favourite child of Zeus, she had great power.\n\nBritannica Quiz Oh My Heavens: A Quiz\n\nAthena\u2019s association with the acropolises of various Greek cities probably stemmed from the location of the kings\u2019 palaces there. She was thought to have had neither consort nor offspring. She may not have been described as a virgin originally, but virginity was attributed to her very early and was the basis for the interpretation of her epithets Pallas and Parthenos. As a war goddess Athena could not be dominated by other goddesses, such as Aphrodite, and as a palace goddess she could not be violated.\n\nIn Homer\u2019s Iliad, Athena, as a war goddess, inspires and fights alongside the Greek heroes; her aid is synonymous with military prowess. Also in the Iliad, Zeus, the chief god, specifically assigns the sphere of war to Ares, the god of war, and Athena. Athena\u2019s moral and military superiority to Ares derives in part from the fact that she represents the intellectual and civilized side of war and the virtues of justice and skill, whereas Ares represents mere blood lust. Her superiority also derives in part from the vastly greater variety and importance of her functions and from the patriotism of Homer\u2019s predecessors, Ares being of foreign origin. In the Iliad, Athena is the divine form of the heroic, martial ideal: she personifies excellence in close combat, victory, and glory. The qualities that lead to victory are found on the aegis, or breastplate, that Athena wears when she goes to war: fear, strife, defense, and assault. Athena appears in Homer\u2019s Odyssey as the tutelary deity of Odysseus, and myths from later sources portray her similarly as helper of Perseus and Heracles (Hercules). As the guardian of the welfare of kings, Athena became the goddess of good counsel, of prudent restraint and practical insight, as well as of war.\n\nIn post-Mycenaean times the city, especially its citadel, replaced the palace as Athena\u2019s domain. She was widely worshipped, but in modern times she is associated primarily with Athens, to which she gave her name. Her emergence there as city goddess, Athena Polias (\u201cAthena, Guardian of the City\u201d), accompanied the ancient city-state\u2019s transition from monarchy to democracy. She was associated with birds, particularly the owl, which became famous as the city\u2019s own symbol, and with the snake. Her birth and her contest with Poseidon, the sea god, for the suzerainty of the city were depicted on the pediments of the Parthenon, and the great festival of the Panathenaea, in July, was a celebration of her birthday. She was also worshipped in many other cities, notably in Sparta.\n\nAthena became the goddess of crafts and skilled peacetime pursuits in general. She was particularly known as the patroness of spinning and weaving. That she ultimately became allegorized to personify wisdom and righteousness was a natural development of her patronage of skill.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

She inspired three of Phidias\u2019s sculptural masterpieces, including the massive chryselephantine (gold and ivory) statue of Athena Parthenos once housed in the Parthenon; and in Aeschylus\u2019s dramatic tragedy Eumenides she founded the Areopagus (Athens\u2019s aristocratic council), and, by breaking a deadlock of the judges in favour of Orestes, the defendant, she set the precedent that a tied vote signified acquittal."}]}
