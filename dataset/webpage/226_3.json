No sooner is she relieved of her mantle as bogeywoman in chief of the national Health Service - a job most people considered to be the bane of her existence - than she is transferred to the Department of National Heritage, and the jokes and anecdotes about her ignorance of cultural matters start doing the rounds.\n\nThe best story I've come across was an overheard conversation from the mid-Eighties. Mrs Bottomley encountered the academic and artistic guru Sir Claus Moser, eminent chairman of the Royal Opera House.\n\n\"So, Sir Claus, what do you do?\" inquired la Bottomley. Sir Claus explained that he had given up his work in government statistics to concentrate on looking after Covent Garden. \"How very, very interesting,\" said Virginia, vaguely recalling that the fruit and veg market had just moved to Nine Elms. \"Has it changed much since it moved south of the river?\"\n\nJohn Redwood may have lost the leadership election, but one facet of his campaign is accumulating iconic status among the Tory right. I refer to That Blazer. The monstrous multicoloured stripy number, the Old Wellingtonian's blazer donned by Tony Marlow, the Tory MP for Northampton, whose girth, alongside Teresa Gorman's emerald suit, provided the garish background scenery for Mr Redwood's historic first press conference. Astonishingly, despite the lampooning of Mr Marlow's lack of dress sense in the press, blazer sales are subsequently up at The Wellington College Shop. \"When I watched the Redwood campaign and saw the old boys' blazer, I thought it could have interesting repercussions,\" says the school's salesman, \"and, sure enough, there has been a burst of inquiries and sales. Things are looking up.\"\n\nPotential purchasers might wish to know that the blazer - which is black with yellow, light blue, orange and amber stripes - costs a mere pounds 94.99, and availability is not restricted to OWs. Despite all the criticisms, Mr Marlow tells me he thoroughly enjoyed wearing it. He has every intention of wearing it again. \"I wore it,\" he says, \"because I felt like a bit of fun. I am fed up with the tyranny of the suit.\"\n\nI have encountered for the first time Auberon Waugh, acerbic columnist and son of the late novelist and staunch Roman Catholic Evelyn Waugh. We chatted last week about the merits of audio-books, as I had recently heard and much enjoyed the tape of Scoop!, Waugh senior's masterful satire on journalism. It seems that his son, though, is unlikely ever to digest his father's prose in this aural manner. \"Unfortunately, I cannot listen to an audio-book for more than five minutes before falling asleep,\" he explained. \"It's because of my Roman Catholic upbringing.\" Pause. \"You see, I became so accustomed to falling asleep the second the priest began his sermon in church that now, anybody delivering a monologue has the same effect.\"\n\nWe may all forget about her as she wafts off into Pakistani obscurity - although I doubt it somehow - but Jemima Goldsmith, or Haiqa Kahn as she is now known, is indelibly marked on the brains of the police in Bristol, where Ms Goldsmith was a student. A former crony recalls that Jemima was recently driving in a new white convertible MG back to mundane university life after a cocktail party in London, when (presumably distracted by heady thoughts of Imran Kahn) she got confused at a roundabout. Just like Sherman McCoy in probably the most famous scene of Tom Wolfe's novel Bonfire of the Vanities, Jemima took a wrong turn. Instead of driving into the smart area of Clifton, she found herself in St Pauls, scene of the Eighties' riots and very definitely Bristol's equivalent of the Bronx. Ms Goldsmith, however, is no lily-livered, hesitant Sherman. Quick as a flash, she picked up her mobile and called for police assistance. The boys in blue arrived and escorted her all the way back home - creating a spectacle that caused certain left-wingers among the undergraduates to \"want to chuck into the nearest dustbin\".\n\nAt the launch of The Way To Win: Strategies for Success in Business and Sport, a tome by the England rugby captain Will Carling and Robert Heller, a middle-aged business consultant and writer, Heller jovially described himself to me as \"the old fart\" in the authorial process. Luckily - I turned round to check - none of the England rugby selection committee were nearby to hear him.\n\nCarling was utterly charming. I asked him for a few tips for my forthcoming wedding day, seeing that he had only tied the knot a year ago himself. \"I remember being more nervous than I've ever been for any rugby match,\" he said, \"but I did manage to absorb every bit of the day. The stag had been two nights before, so I'd had the Friday to recover - which I'd needed. We started off in Julie's restaurant in Notting Hill (where Prince Charles had his stag) and finished up in the Atlantic Bar. After that,\" he sighed and grinned, \"my memory fails me.\"\n\nChampagne corks are popping at the London offices of Sight & Sound, the monthly film magazine owned by the British Film Institute. Sales have reached an all-time high of 40,000 - not entirely, it has to be said, because of the efforts of all the staff. Aid has arrived from an unexpected source: the Australian TV soap Neighbours. \"In the last month or so we have noticed that for some inexplicable reason every time Ramsey Street's local newsagent is featured, the Sight & Sound sticker is plastered in the middle of the screen. We couldn't ask for more.\" says the magazine's marketing director, Caroline Moore, adding more soberly: \"We wouldn't have known if one of us had not been reduced to watching it in slow-motion on the video.\"\n\nSo folks, this is it. The moment you've all been waiting for. You will never have to read my guff about my wedding ever again ... it happens this Saturday. The dress is ready (to my dressmaker's horror it has had to be let out, not in), the seating plan is done, the hat for the going-away outfit is bought and, as I write this, I feel sick just thinking about the whole thing. I have not been helped by my colleagues. Last week there were incessant jests about \"lambs going to the slaughter\", \"virginal sacrifices\" and, to top it all, my present, which I found on my desk yesterday morning, is a book. Its title? How to Do Your Own Divorce. Friends ... who needs 'em?"}, {"url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/bottomley-admits-more-help-is-needed-for-mentally-ill-catalogue-of-failure-and-missed-opportunity-in-schizophrenic-s-treatment-led-to-killing-1396224.html", "page_content": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

However, it said police, psychiatrists, social workers, the Crown Prosecution Service, hostel staff, the probation service and the private sector must all share the blame for their failure to prevent Clunis killing Jonathan Zito at Finsbury Park tube station, north London, on 17 December 1992. 'It was one failure or missed opportunity on top of another.'\n\nThe inquiry, chaired by Jean Ritchie QC, found that 'the more disturbed Christopher Clunis became, the less effective was the care he received.' Its report added that the police, among others, failed to protect the public; they tended 'to overlook or minimise violent incidents' involving the mentally ill.\n\nThe inquiry stated bluntly that lack of resources and psychiatric beds was only part of the story; for deficiencies to be made good 'a considerable injection of funds' was 'the only answer'.\n\nIt also warned that 'we have heard time and again . . . Christopher Clunis is not alone, that there are many more like him living in the community who are\n\na risk either to themselves or others'.\n\nWhile backing the community care policy, it warned that some patients will always require long-term 'haven-type' care. The more than 50 recommendations include providing: special teams funded with earmarked money to supervise and support an estimated 3,000-4,000 most disturbed and difficult patients; a national register of those compulsorily detained in hospital; and a supervised discharge order so patients who fail to take medication or comply with treatment can be recalled to hospital. The Department of Health must require health authorities to set minimum standards of manpower and facilities.\n\nMrs Bottomley yesterday said she had anticipated many of the recommendations, with supervision registers starting in April, the supervision of those discharged having been agreed, but not legislated for, and a pounds 45m plan in place to provide 1,000 more medium secure beds by 1995-96.\n\nShe announced an extra pounds 10m for community-based mental health services in London from next year.\n\nHer moves do not set nationally enforceable minimum standards or create special supervision teams or meet Ms Ritchie's estimate that an increase of more than 20 to 30 per cent in inner London psychiatric beds is needed. Mrs Bottomley said she would now 'urgently consider' further action. The inquiry said 'only if the whole package is provided (will) care in the community work effectively'.\n\nJayne Zito, Mr Zito's widow, said unless all recommendations were implemented 'we cannot call ourselves a civilised society and Jonathan's murder was in vain'.\n\nThe report was welcomed by Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, for 'acknowledging care in the community is failing'. The National Schizophrenia Fellowship said the pounds 2bn spent on mental illness services needed to be raised by pounds 500m a year.\n\n(Photograph omitted)\n\nAnalysis, page 5\n\nLeading article, page 17"}, {"url": "https://prabook.com/web/virginia.bottomley/879699", "page_content": "Virginia Bottomley\n\ngovernment official\n\nMarch 12, 1948 England, UK\n\nMember of Parliament for Surrey South West, since 1984.
