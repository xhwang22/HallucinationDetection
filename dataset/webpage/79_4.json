With the blessing of Duncan's wife, Janette, I then filleted out the bits that weren't actually by Duncan and nursed his words into a narrative account.\n\n'I did so with the utmost affection, and I'd had some practice.

Picture: Archant (Image: Archant)\n\nAs the current Norwich City team strive to recover from a disappointing start to their Championship season, a unique perspective to the club's first ever promotion to the top division is to be published.\n\nForbes, legendary captain of the team who topped the second tier in 1972, admits the team did not take the pretty route to the top.\n\nDuncan Forbes. Legend. Picture: Archant (Image: Archant)\n\n'I wouldn't say I was a footballing centre-half. No, I was a bit rough. At the end of the day, each individual player has a job to do and mine was to stop my man from scoring.\n\n'If you look at the team that went up that season, it was a hard team: players who really didn't want to lose. Ken Foggo had been there a while when Ron Saunders arrived as manager and had been a fans' favourite on the wing. But he just didn't have the lung capacity to do what Saunders wanted of him and so didn't play many games.\n\n'At that time, Saunders was definitely the right man for the club. He wasn't a man you could get really close to, but I would always give an honest performance and I think he trusted me to do that.\n\n'Every team had a big, tough centre-forward. There was Jeff Astle at West Brom, Roger Davis at Derby, John Radford and Ray Kennedy for Arsenal, at Chelsea you had Peter Osgood up front. He smashed me quite a few times.\n\nDuncan Forbes with a copy of the Evening News from 1972 when City won promotion to the top flight. Picture: Archant (Image: Archant)\n\n'Every player you played against then, you had a battle. If they saw you were weak, you'd be finished. So you would, early on, just go through them; let them know you were there. I wouldn't go out to kick a player and get him injured, but I was able to tackle from the back \u2013 kind of take the man and the ball at the same time.\n\n'Saunders never wanted to lose. And that attitude really showed in the 1971-72 season when there were three clubs \u2013 us, Birmingham and Millwall \u2013 chasing two promotion places at the top of the Second Division.\n\n'Our last two home games were against Sheffield Wednesday and Swindon. We won them both 1-0 and I scored both the goals. The one against Sheffield Wednesday was at the River End, and the one that beat Swindon was at the Barclay End. I think they had 32,000 in that day. Days like that you never forget.\n\n'We had two away games to finish the season, but only needed one win to get promotion. The first one was at Leyton Orient and I often think back to that night. Foggo and Graham Paddon scored, we won 2-1 and I remember coming back on the bus that night and there were all these supporters on the road in their own buses and in cars, and more waiting for us when we got back.\n\nDuncan Forbes leads out the Canaries. Picture: Archant (Image: Archant)\n\n'All of us players knew then that we were going to be playing in the First Division, the top division, and for me, that was the be-all and end-all.\n\n'The following Saturday we drew 1-1 with Watford \u2013 Dave Stringer got our goal \u2013 and we had won our division.\n\n'When you do anything for the first time it is unique \u2013 and that is why that team was unique and why Saunders was unique. I think he knew, looking at the players and the players that he got in, he had a team that could do the job.\n\n'When John Bond became manager he wasn't keen on my tackling. I'd go through the centre-forward and come away with the ball and sometimes Bond would actually say, 'Did you really need to do that?' But to be fair to him, he took us up to the top division again, kept us there, and brought in some terrific players.'\n\nDuncan Forbes. Norwich v Aston Villa, August 23, 1975.

He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great.

He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.pinkun.com/news/22705627.duncan-forbes-story-norwich-city-legend/", "page_content": "Duncan Forbes heading goalwards during the 1973 League Cup final against Spurs at Wembley Picture: Archant\n\nForbes had a robust style of play that wouldn't survive the limitations of 21st century football, where the tackle is slowly but surely being outlawed and where players drop to their knees at the merest touch.\n\nIronic, really, that it served him so well: he made 357 appearances for Norwich City but was never sent off, although a columnist for The Times once noted: \"Forbes got his customary booking; the referee ought to take his name in the changing room rather than on the pitch thus saving time.\"\n\nNo matter, he was an iconic figure amongst the Norwich City faithful, and deservedly so. Forbes was the sort of player who commanded attention, not by words, but deeds. His was a game that required discipline, bravery and leadership.\n\nHe himself told a story about a tournament in Portugal where Dundee were also playing: \"After a couple off days they heard my voice and someone shouted out of the window to me, 'keep your voice down to a roar'.\"\n\nNorwich City legend Duncan Forbes Picture: Archant Library (Image: Archant Library)\n\nOne of Forbes' great achievements was leading City to the Second Division title in 1971-72 to put the club into the top flight for the first time in their history.\n\nHe missed 18 league and cup games because of a hamstring injury - for a tough, no-nonsense defender it was remarkable that this was his first serious injury. He called it the worst period of his footballing career: \"I had never been injured before and I was beginning to worry about it.\"\n\nBut back he came, and played a crucial part in City going up, with the only goal of the game at home to Sheffield Wednesday and then Swindon Town - inevitably, both headed goals, as he climbed high and unmarked to leave the net bulging.\n\nAs is tradition, it led to an appearance before thousands of fans on the balcony at City Hall, where he was greeted with chants of 'we are the champions' - not the Queen version, of course, but the anthemic almost naive terrace call of the time - and held the trophy aloft.\n\nNorwich City legend Duncan Forbes with former team-mate and good friend Dave Stringer in October 1996 Picture: Archant Library (Image: Archant Library)\n\nThis was the jumpers for goalposts era, the stuff of mud and guts and glory. Of brains and brawn.\n\nFor those of us whose footballing lives were influenced in the 70s, Norwich City on Anglia TV's Match of the Week on a Sunday afternoon was staple viewing. Paddon, Stringer, Keelan, Saunders, Forbes. They were the men we aspired to be, the players we looked up to. Forbes had it all: strength, leadership, respect. We all wanted that. We all wanted to be leaders.\n\nWhen the TV commentator Gerry Harrison asked Forbes what he considered his role to be, the reply was: \"Apart from your usual, defensive roles, the main thing is you have got to shout at the lads, encourage them, and keep them going. I've got quite a loud voice and this helps me tremendously.\"\n\nForbes was associated with City for more than three decades - another remarkable statistic that is unlikely to be replicated in the modern era - during which time his work included organising travel to away games, a period when he enjoyed working alongside supporters, travelling with them and, typically Forbes, befriending them. The man from Edinburgh was a man of the people.\n\nDuncan Forbes leaps above Arsenal's Terry Mancini in 1976 Picture: Archant Library (Image: Archant Library)\n\nBut a few years after his retirement it was revealed he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, eventually moving into a care home.\n\nHis widow, Janette, spoke carefully and movingly on the effect it had on her and her husband, the dreadful way it changes live forever, with harrowing stories of Duncan Forbes that perhaps only she was privvy to.\n\n\"It's important to say that none of this was Duncan\u2026 not the real Duncan...

Forbes was the sort of player who commanded attention, not by words, but deeds. His was a game that required discipline, bravery and leadership.\n\nHe himself told a story about a tournament in Portugal where Dundee were also playing: \"After a couple off days they heard my voice and someone shouted out of the window to me, 'keep your voice down to a roar'.\"\n\nNorwich City legend Duncan Forbes Picture: Archant Library (Image: Archant Library)\n\nOne of Forbes' great achievements was leading City to the Second Division title in 1971-72 to put the club into the top flight for the first time in their history.\n\nHe missed 18 league and cup games because of a hamstring injury - for a tough, no-nonsense defender it was remarkable that this was his first serious injury. He called it the worst period of his footballing career: \"I had never been injured before and I was beginning to worry about it.\"\n\nBut back he came, and played a crucial part in City going up, with the only goal of the game at home to Sheffield Wednesday and then Swindon Town - inevitably, both headed goals, as he climbed high and unmarked to leave the net bulging.\n\nAs is tradition, it led to an appearance before thousands of fans on the balcony at City Hall, where he was greeted with chants of 'we are the champions' - not the Queen version, of course, but the anthemic almost naive terrace call of the time - and held the trophy aloft.\n\nNorwich City legend Duncan Forbes with former team-mate and good friend Dave Stringer in October 1996 Picture: Archant Library (Image: Archant Library)\n\nThis was the jumpers for goalposts era, the stuff of mud and guts and glory. Of brains and brawn.\n\nFor those of us whose footballing lives were influenced in the 70s, Norwich City on Anglia TV's Match of the Week on a Sunday afternoon was staple viewing. Paddon, Stringer, Keelan, Saunders, Forbes. They were the men we aspired to be, the players we looked up to. Forbes had it all: strength, leadership, respect. We all wanted that. We all wanted to be leaders.\n\nWhen the TV commentator Gerry Harrison asked Forbes what he considered his role to be, the reply was: \"Apart from your usual, defensive roles, the main thing is you have got to shout at the lads, encourage them, and keep them going. I've got quite a loud voice and this helps me tremendously.\"\n\nForbes was associated with City for more than three decades - another remarkable statistic that is unlikely to be replicated in the modern era - during which time his work included organising travel to away games, a period when he enjoyed working alongside supporters, travelling with them and, typically Forbes, befriending them. The man from Edinburgh was a man of the people.\n\nDuncan Forbes leaps above Arsenal's Terry Mancini in 1976 Picture: Archant Library (Image: Archant Library)\n\nBut a few years after his retirement it was revealed he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, eventually moving into a care home.\n\nHis widow, Janette, spoke carefully and movingly on the effect it had on her and her husband, the dreadful way it changes live forever, with harrowing stories of Duncan Forbes that perhaps only she was privvy to.\n\n\"It's important to say that none of this was Duncan\u2026 not the real Duncan...

The object was to bring together athletes from around the world for the purpose of running the first sub-four-minute mile, which at the time was regarded as the pinnacle of athletics achievement.\n\nIt remained one of Sir William's great disappointments that, when the barrier was finally broken, by Roger Bannister the following year at Iffley Road in Oxford, it did not happen in his race.\n\nBut there have been many memorable moments since to compensate. The first man to break four minutes in the Emsley Carr Mile was Ibbotson, who ran 3min 59.4sec at the White City in 1956. The race record stands to Hicham El Guerrouj, whose 3.45.96 in 2000 is the ninth fastest ever.\n\nThe Moroccan was due to chase a record fourth consecutive win but has withdrawn because of a minor back injury, leaving Cornelius Chircir as the favourite.\n\nIf he succeeds, becoming the fourth Kenyan winner, his signature will appear with every other winner's in a special Emsley Carr Mile Trophy illuminated book, bound in red morocco leather and based on the 1953 Coronation bible.\n\nIt contains a history of mile running since 1868 as well as signatures of many other leading milers, including Paavo Nurmi, Sydney Wooderson, John Landy and Bannister, now Sir Roger, and the result of each Emsley Carr Mile.\n\nThe original book was completed in 1980, so the following year Carr commissioned a second volume which matched the first. Other past winners include Kip Keino, Jim Ryun, Filbert Bayi and Steve Ovett.\n\nBut the race has particular significance for Coe. It was in this event that he ran his first sub-four-minute mile in 1976. He led for three laps before being passed by seven men in the home stretch, including Moorcroft, whose win in 3:57.06 fulfilled a dream.\n\n\"I'd watched the Emsley Carr Mile in 1967 when Jim Ryun had beat Kip Keino at White City,\" said Moorcroft. \"There are moments in your life when you want to do something and the Emsley Carr Mile had a mystique about it. I'd run it in 1971 when I was 18 and there had been lots of speculation that I would be the first teenager to break four minutes for the mile. But I got hammered at Meadowbank [Peter Stewart won]. So winning it in 1976 meant loads to me.\"\n\nThere was no beating Coe in 1977, though, when he finished ahead of a field that included Bayi. It heralded a golden age in British athletics during which the mile became the sexiest event in sport.\n\n\"I'd run on Saturday in the South Yorkshire League in the 400m and then for Britain against West Germany at Crystal Palace the next day,\" Coe recalled. \"Then the AAA officials said why not run in the Emsley Carr Mile the next day? I was debating about it but my old man said it was too big an opportunity to miss. It was a good decision. It was one of the races which started the ball rolling.\"\n\nBy the end of last year 938 men had broken four minutes for the mile, once thought to be beyond human reach. Despite the fact that the metric equivalent, 1500 metres, is the distance contested at major championships, the mile retains its unique fascination.\n\n\"Bannister's was probably the most significant world record ever,\" said Moorcroft. \"It was the Everest of athletics. It caught the public's imagination and therefore the legend of the Emsley Carr Mile lives on.\"\n\nIn 1969 Carr became ill and control of the News of the World passed to Rupert Murdoch. He decided not to continue the race's sponsorship, so the Amateur Athletic Association took it over and continued the tradition until Sir William died in 1977.\n\nSince then Emsley Carr's grandson, William, has kept the book up to date and provided a presentation glass piece for each winner to keep. This has always been presented by a member of the Carr family.\n\nThe News of the World have renewed their links this year by sponsoring Tom Lancashire, the European 1500m silver medallist, as Britain seeks its first winner since Kevin McKay in 1994.\n\nThe 18-year-old from Bolton cites Haile Gebrselassie, the Emsley Carr Mile winner in 1999, as his hero. What Lancashire would to give to see his name appear alongside that of the great Ethiopian in the red leather book imbued with so much history.\n\nEmsley Carr high spots\n\n1953\n\nThe first Emsley Carr Mile is won by Gordon Pirie at White City Stadium in 4min 06.8sec.\n\n1956\n\nYorkshire's Derek Ibbotson becomes the first man to break four minutes in the Emsley Carr Mile when he runs 3:59.4 at the White City.\n\n1967\n\nThe American Jim Ryun beats Kenya's Kip Keino in a classic race at the White City and sets a new event record of 3:56.02. The following year Keino beats Ryun to claim Olympic 1500m gold.\n\n1976\n\nSebastian Coe leads for most of the race at Crystal Palace before being swallowed up and finishing eighth in a race won by David Moorcroft in 3:57.06. It is the first occasion Coe breaks four minutes.\n\n1977\n\nCoe makes a late decision to run and beats a classy field in 3:57.67. A legend is born.\n\n2000\n\nThe day after meeting the now Sir Roger Bannister at Iffley Road, an inspired Hicham El Guerrouj runs 3:45.96, the fastest mile ever in Britain."}, {"url": "https://www.last.fm/music/Duncan+Mackay/+wiki", "page_content": "Duncan Mackay\n\nKeyboard Supremo\n\nDuncan Mackay\n\nDiscography:\n\nSingles\n\n* Come And Get it - Tricycle (1973)\n\n* Sirius 3 (1978)\n\n* T Rex And The Thin White Duke - Lockwood Mackay (1997)\n\n* Awakening - Reunion (2003)\n\nAlbums\n\n* Chimera (1974)\n\n* Score (1977)\n\n* Visa (1980)\n\n* Songs To Fall In Love To - Lockwood Mackay (1997)\n\nwith Neil Lockwood from ELO II\n\n* Reunion work-in-progress (2004)\n\nBiography:\n\nBorn in Leeds in England, but moved to Port Elizabeth, South Africa in mid-sixties.

My father, who was and still is a Methodist church organist, said \"that music will never last!\"\n\nWell this week, thanks to Leon Economides (co-presenter with Phil Wright of the Dinosaur Days programme on 5FM on Sunday nights) introduced me to a fourth keyboard wizard, current Cape Town resident, Duncan Mackay. Duncan was born in Leeds, England but immigrated to South Africa in the mid-60s with his parents and settled in Port Elizabeth.\n\nDuncan Mackay's 'Chimera' recorded in 1973/4 and forever forgotten by all but the most devout is a brilliant slice of 70s progressive keyboard-based rock. All three of the wizards mentioned above are obvious influences, but Duncan clearly stamps his own sound onto this 3-track album. (only 3 tracks? - well this was 1974, the era of 'Tales From Topographic Oceans' by Yes!).\n\nDuncan has played for some very famous international artists including Kate Bush, 10cc, Steve Harley's Cockney Rebel, Camel and Elkie Brooks. He recently teamed up with Neil Lockwood from The Electric Light Orchestra Part II as Lockwood Mackay and released an album which included 'TRex and the Thin White Duke', a musical tribute in words and style to those 70s Kings (Queens?) of glamrock, Marc Bolan and David Bowie.\n\nSo this week we have 2 hidden gems from the same artist, 25 years apart, the one easy-to-find, the other near-to-impossible \u2013 enjoy the search.\n\n\u2013 Brian Currin, October 1999"}], "Duncan Mackay won the Football League Cup in 1985.": [{"url": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18141730.obituary-duncan-mackay-highly-esteemed-celtic-full-back-won-honours-australia/", "page_content": "Born:July 14, 1937;\n\nDied: December 23, 2019.\n\nIT IS a long way from Maryhill to Melbourne, but in his 82 years that was the journey made by the esteemed former Celtic and Scotland full-back Dunky Mackay.\n\nLike many before him, Duncan\u2019s father, also Duncan, had left the West Highlands for the city, where he worked at several jobs to keep a roof over his family\u2019s head. He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys' Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season's end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \"distinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic's Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club's history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.thecelticwiki.com/players/all-time-a-to-z-of-celtic-players/m/mackay-duncan/", "page_content": "Personal\n\nFullname: Duncan MacKay\n\naka: Dunky MacKay\n\nBorn: 14 July 1937\n\nDied: 23 December 2019\n\nBirthplace: Springburn\n\nSigned: 11 April 1955\n\nLeft: 6 November 1964 (Third Lanark)\n\nPosition: Right-back\n\nDebut: Clyde 1-4 Celtic, League Cup, 9 Aug 1958\n\nInternationals: Scotland\n\nInternational Caps: 14\n\nInternational Goals: 0\n\nBiog\n\nThe classy Duncan MacKay signed for Celtic from Maryhill Harp in April 1955.\n\nOn his signing, he was proclaimed as the find of the season, and for the next season was \u201cthe best defensive prospect in the country\u201c.\n\nThe stylish right-back made his debut in a 4-1 League Cup win at Clyde in August 1958 and would spend the next six years as one of the top performers in disappointing & underachieving Celtic sides.\n\nDuncan MacKay had fantastic pace and stamina and he was a wonderful attacking full-back who was one of the first players in that position to use the over-lap as a regular feature of his game.\n\nWith fine control and a pin-point accurate pass, Duncan MacKay would always attempt to play the ball out of defence rather than just rely on the long clearance up the park. He was not overly physical in his defending either, preferring to win the ball through quick thinking and anticipation rather than just brute strength. So in some ways he was ahead of his time.\n\nThis refined approach to the game made him a popular player among the Celtic support and the Scotland selectors who capped him 14 times.\n\nHe became the captain in 1961, and then led the first team to the Scottish Cup matches v Dunfermline (the final & replay), but in both unfortunately Celtic once again came up short and lost. The side were perennially underachieving despite the wealth of talent on hand.\n\nWith Celtic so poor, he actually decided openly to request a move to England, but there was surprisingly little interest (Celtic\u2019s poor state a likely major cause of the lack of interest). You have to take in the poor team management at the time at Celtic, lack of morale in the squad and the constant board meddling. It wasn\u2019t an uncommon position. Jimmy Johnstone, Billy McNeill and Lennox were all also on the verge of leaving or giving up before Jock Stein\u2019s arrival at Celtic.\n\nDuncan McKay lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill in 1963, and his place in the first team later in the year. His last game was a single appearance in the 1964/65 season with a 4-2 defeat to Hearts.\n\nHe was not a heavy goalscorer, but curiously once he scored his first the others soon enough followed. He took a long time to score his first for Celtic, a penalty in a 7-0 victory over St Mirren in November 1962. However, over April & May 1963, he scored five goals (all penalties), including a double over Raith Rovers in a Scottish Cup semi-final. His last goal (also a penalty) was in October 1963 as Celtic defeated Aberdeen 3-0.\n\nIt was a great injustice to Duncan McKay\u2019s wonderful ability that he never won any major trophies as a Celt. This popular player eventually left Parkhead in 1964 for Third Lanark after 236 appearances and 7 goals.\n\nThe saddest aspect is that he was a great player in one of the poorer eras for Celtic. After the League Cup win in 1957, Celtic did not win another major trophy again until 1965. His first team career sadly spanned practically the whole of this period. Jock Stein became the club manager only a few months after Duncan Mackay\u2019s departure. If Jock Stein had arrived sooner then possibly Duncan Mackay could have won a medal worthy of his talents.\n\nHe is one of the finest regular long-term first team Celtic players to leave Celtic without a medal for a major trophy (Willie Miller is another in this group). He deserved better, and it is an indictment of the club at the time for just how poor the First Team were.\n\nHowever, the Celtic support more then recognised his talent. In 1967, following the triumph in Lisbon in the European Cup, a poll by the Evening Times amongst its readers surveyed for the best Celtic team in living memory. To his credit, Duncan MacKay walked in at right-back. A great accolade and a mark of the respect the support had for him.\n\nAfter Third Lanark, he moved to Australia to play for various sides and then later to coach clubs there also, with a brief period back home in Scotland between 1972-74 when he was player-coach with Juniors St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHe passed away in December 2018, coincidentally just a few weeks after the passing of Ian Young who had succeeded him as the right-back at Celtic.\n\nPlaying Career\n\nAPPEARANCES LEAGUE SCOTTISH CUP LEAGUE CUP EUROPE TOTAL 1955-64 162 33 37 \u2013 236 Goals 5 2 0 \u2013 7\n\nHonours with Celtic\n\nnone\n\nPictures\n\nForums\n\nArticles\n\nDuncan MacKay Source: http://sesasport.com/?p=760 Duncan MacKay had a relatively short but stellar career with Celtic, racking up 236 games for the club from 1958 to 1964 and 14 Scottish caps in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He moved to Third Lanark in 1964 when Bill Hiddleston was engaged in the destruction of that club and in 1965 Frank Burin from the Croatia club in Melbourne persuaded him to try his luck in Australia. Mackay had an immediate impact on the club which had just been promoted to the Victorian State League, the top division. Croatia had been up and down between the State League and lower divisions over previous seasons but this time president Enver Begovic organised an open cheque-book approach that resulted in the expenditure of \u00a35000 in two months. Hammy McMeechan from Slavia was signed for a Victorian record fee of \u00a31200. Other newcomers were Joe Keenan, Ian Currie, Bobby McLachlan, Bill McIntyre and Brian Adlam. Croatia finished sixth in 1965. It was the \u2018Glamour Team\u2019 of the season, according to the Victorian Soccer Federation Yearbook. The early season form had been poor, six of the first seven games were lost, and it looked as if Croatia would go back down again, but the attraction of Duncan MacKay and the other players resulted in a transformation in the second half of the season when it finished with eleven wins. Croatia was also runner-up in the Dockerty Cup in 1965. The team which was to take Croatia to the top in Victoria and Australia was now in place. Croatia finished 6th in 1966, 3rd in 1967 under Jimmy Adam, and won the State League for the first time in 1968 under coach Mijo Kiss, finishing seven points clear of Polonia. Only four league games were lost all season. In addition, Croatia won the Ampol Cup and the Dockerty Cup, to complete an extraordinary triumph. In 1972 after an incident involving crowd trouble in a match against Hakoah, Croatia was suspended from the Victorian Soccer Federation and eventually refused permission to regain its position in the State League. It was not till 1974 that the Croatians took over Essendon Lions and resumed participation at a lower level. Duncan MacKay returned to Scotland in March 1972 and was player-coach at St Anthony\u2019s, but he came back to Australia to the Azzurri club in Western Australia in 1974 and in 1977 he returned to Melbourne with Essendon Lions as player-coach.\n\nDeath of Celtic great Duncan MacKay\n\nBy: Newsroom Staff on 26 Dec, 2019 11:31\n\nhttp://www.celticfc.net/news/17326\n\nEVERYONE at Celtic Football Club is saddened to hear of the death of former player, Duncan MacKay, who has passed away at the age of 82.\n\nDunky, who played for the Hoops between 1955-64, making 236 appearances and scoring seven goals, is rightly considered a Celtic great. His first-team debut came in August 1958, in a League Cup tie against Clyde at Shawfield, which Celtic won 4-1, and he soon established himself as first-choice right-back in the team.\n\nA highly-rated defender who was an early exponent of the attacking full-back role later honed by the likes of Tommy Gemmell and Jim Craig, Dunky MacKay was a firm fans\u2019 favourite and his leadership qualities were identified by Jimmy McGrory, who made him captain in 1961, succeeding Bertie Peacock as skipper.\n\nHe would later pass on the captain\u2019s armband to Billy McNeill for the start of the 1963/64 season.\n\nIn November 1984, he moved to Third Lanark, before heading out to Australia where he would eventually settle after a brief return to Scotland. He also gained 14 caps for Scotland during his playing career.\n\nThe thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic are with Duncan\u2019s family and friends at this very sad time.\n\nThe Celtic players will wear black armbands at today\u2019s game against St Mirren as a mark of respect.\n\nObituary: Duncan Mackay, highly esteemed Celtic full-back who won honours in Australia\n\nBy Matt Vallance\n\n(2)\n\nSource: https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/18141730.obituary-duncan-mackay-highly-esteemed-celtic-full-back-won-honours-australia/Former Celtic captain and Scotland full-back\n\nBorn:July 14, 1937;\n\nDied: December 23, 2019.\n\nIT IS a long way from Maryhill to Melbourne, but in his 82 years that was the journey made by the esteemed former Celtic and Scotland full-back Dunky Mackay.\n\nLike many before him, Duncan\u2019s father, also Duncan, had left the West Highlands for the city, where he worked at several jobs to keep a roof over his family\u2019s head. He insisted the young Duncan wore his Mackay tartan kilt every day. But getting into schoolyard scrapes when responding to taunts of \u201cKiltie, kiltie cauld-bum\u201d began to wear thin with the youngster, and he persuaded his parents to get him into long trousers.\n\nAt St Columba\u2019s High his exceptional skill with a football got him noticed. He moved to St Mary\u2019s Boys\u2019 Guild, where Celtic signed him on a provisional form, farming him out to juniors, Maryhill Harp. By now the teenaged Mackay had seen the great Hungarian side of Ferenc Puskas and the sort of attacking football he wanted to play. He had left school and started an apprenticeship as a marine engineer.\n\nHe turned full-time at Celtic after completing his apprenticeship. During the 1958-59 campaign he made the first of his 236 first-team appearances in a League Cup tie against Clyde. By season\u2019s end he was first choice, and an Under-23 cap. On April 11, 1959, aged 21, he made the first of an eventual 14 appearances for Scotland, against England at Wembley.\n\nHis full-back partner that day was Rangers\u2019 Eric Caldow and the pair hit it off immediately. Indeed, they played together 12 times for Scotland, making Mackay Caldow\u2019s most frequent international partner. Caldow would relate how, as Scotland captain, he once distributed \u2018fan mail\u2019 when the national squad was training at Largs; finding one addressed to \u201cDonkey Mackay\u2019 he quipped, \u201cThis lassie must have seen you playing, Dunky\u201d. In reality, Caldow, rated his Celtic friend very highly as a player.\n\nBut, if things were going well with Scotland, all was not well at Celtic Park, where, following the 1957 League Cup win, the side struggled to compete with Rangers, Kilmarnock and Hearts, then the top teams. Bertie Peacock left the club and Mackay was appointed team captain in 1960, leading them to the Scottish Cup final of 1961, where they lost to Dunfermline after a replay. Indeed, along with 1940s goalkeeper Willie Miller, Mackay shares the \u201cdistinction\u201d of having won more Scotland caps than medals as a Celtic player.\n\nIn 1963 he lost the captaincy to Billy McNeill, then, after injury he lost his first-team place, partly because, it is rumoured, manager Jimmy McGrory and chairman Bob Kelly, who picked the side, did not like Mackay\u2019s attacking sorties up the wing.\n\nIn November, 1964, he left Celtic for Third Lanark. This is one of Scottish football\u2019s great \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d; maybe, had he hung on until Jock Stein returned in February, 1965, he would have regained his place. Stein certainly preferred attacking full-backs. But Thirds were starting to implode and at the end of that season, Mackay joined Melbourne Croatia, who were spending big in a bid to become the top side in the Victoria League.\n\nHe was an instant success, being appointed captain and winning the Player of the Year title in his first season. He led Croatia to several trophies, including a league-and-two-cups treble in 1972, but the club fell foul of Australian Soccer financial rules and collapsed. Mackay returned to Scotland for two seasons, working as a bookbinder and coaching junior outfit St Anthony\u2019s.\n\nHis first marriage, when a young man, had failed. But while, back home, he married his second wife, Marilyn, before, in 1974, Perth Azzurri, in Western Australia, offered him a player-coach role.\n\nHe led the Azzurri to back-to-back league titles, then returned to Melbourne, to Essendon Lions, as Croatia had now become. Here he found success as a league-winning coach, before winding down his active involvement in football with South Melbourne Hellas.\n\nMelbourne clearly suited Mackay. In his first spell with Croatia, he turned down the chance to join Pele at New York Cosmos. His non-football working life turned full circle when he joined Transfeld Ship Builders as a Senior Procurement Buyer \u2013 the post he filled until his retirement.\n\nHe and Marilyn, who survives him, had two daughters, Shone and Elissa. He is also survived by son Duncan Junior, from his first marriage, who also lives in Australia. Paul, another son from that first marriage predeceased his father. In retirement, Mackay enjoyed listening to the Beatles, Barbra Streisand and Tony Bennett.\n\nDunky Mackay was a very good full-back. He was Celtic\u2019s Player of the Year in 1963, and Man of the Match when they played Real Madrid at Parkhead in a friendly. Sadly, he never had the medals to show for playing at a low point in the club\u2019s history, but on the other side of the world he finally won a few medals, forged a good reputation as a coach, and perhaps showed Scottish football what it lost when it allowed him to leave.\n\nMATT VALLANCE"}, {"url": "https://www.footballdatabase.eu/en/player/details/71966-duncan-mackay", "page_content": "Adblocker detected!
