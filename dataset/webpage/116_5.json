He was tied to a handful of jobs, including as a strong candidate in New Orleans and as a finalist in Washington. It was the latest sign that Lee is ready to take the next step in his career.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee, 37, is in his eighth season in the NBA and all eight have been spent on the bench alongside Mike Budenholzer, first in Atlanta and now in Milwaukee where Budenholzer is the Bucks head coach, and the franchise is the reigning NBA champion. A former Patriot League Player of the Year at Bucknell, Lee played in Europe after college, before moving into coaching.\n\nIt seems as if Lee will get his chance to run his own team at some point, if last year\u2019s hiring cycle was an indication. He took some time recently to speak with The Athletic for its 40 under 40 series. He discussed what he\u2019s learned from Budenholzer, his approach as a coach, what he\u2019s taken from working with Giannis Antetokounmpo and what he took from coming so close last offseason.\n\nYou\u2019ve worked with Mike in two stops now. How much have you pulled from him? What is your approach as a coach dealing with NBA players?\n\nI would say I\u2019ve drawn a lot from Coach Bud. I\u2019ve been blessed to have worked for a guy who was Coach of the Year. Who\u2019s won championships, even outside of Milwaukee, but as an assistant, obviously, in San Antonio. And then the other assistant coaches that he\u2019s had on staff, I\u2019ve gotten to draw and pull from Taylor Jenkins, who\u2019s crushing it in Memphis. And Darvin Ham and Neven Spahija and Kenny Atkinson. It\u2019s been a special group to kind of draw a lot of different thoughts and ideas from, but I would say what I\u2019ve learned over the years, there are so many variables that go on in a day-to-day process, and throughout a season, and the thing that I keep falling back on is just like controlling what you can control. The schedule\u2019s tough and injuries happen and all this stuff, but can we just be focused and obsessed with just controlling what we can control, which is our preparation on a daily basis, our effort levels, and then our mental makeup?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m a big \u2018power of positivity\u2019 guy. Yeah, there\u2019s some adversity, there\u2019s some, quote-unquote, failures or losses, but how are we going to respond to that and how do we just develop this thicker skin to be able to deal with these adverse situations? Then controlling what you can control kind of flows into my coaching philosophy. Daily improvement \u2014 how can we make sure that we\u2019re just making everyday matter? Whether it\u2019s on the court, we\u2019re going to improve, with our skill set, whether it\u2019s in the weight room getting stronger, whether it\u2019s the diet part of our nutrition, just to help our body to be able to recover. Have you just be obsessed again, like daily improvement and not getting bored with the day-to-day improvements. The second part, again, competitiveness. I think that if you can compete at a high level physically, but also the mental side of it as well, you\u2019re going to put yourself in a good position to win a lot of games. And then the third part of my philosophy is just togetherness. How can we come together as a team? How can I as the head coach, or even as an assistant coach, build relationships where I\u2019m earning their trust? Where they will let me coach them, they will allow me to help impart some wisdom to them as basketball players? And also just admit, because I want to see the best for them. And I think that once players feel that there\u2019s a connection and a real genuine relationship, it makes them want to play a little bit harder for you.\n\nWhat have you learned from working with Giannis and coaching Giannis when it comes to coaching star players and getting them to trust you?\n\nBeing honest. Not beating around the bush. Understanding the game and doing your homework and watching the film and going back and forth, but then just finding opportunities to hit him on things that are just honest. Like, not always, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re the best. You know, you\u2019re doing this great,\u2019 No, he wants to be coached. All the players from Giannis down to our 15th guys \u2014 Lindell Wigginton and Jevon Carter or Jordan Nwora, whoever it is, they just want you to be honest with them and upfront. I think that when you outline clear expectations for players, they respect that more than anything else.\n\nSo what was last year like, winning the title? What, what was that like for you personally?\n\nMy talking about kind of controlling what you could control, there\u2019s so much hard work that goes into a season and every year we all have this goal, obviously, of trying to compete or win a championship, and we\u2019ve fallen short in previous years, and we\u2019ve had some great seasons. Staying patient but continuing to trust your hard work, that it\u2019s gonna pay off. And then last year, we finally hit the pinnacle, which is kind of what you\u2019ve been working for. It felt really good because we\u2019ve been kind of to the top of the mountain or really close to the top the mountain of getting to the finals. Last year, we finally get there, and it just felt great to see it and all the hard work that we had put in, all the daily improvement, all the adversity that we had kind of gone through and come together, we had grown.\n\nAfter that, it seemed like you were interviewing with several teams for a head coaching job. It looked like, at least according to reports, that you were close in New Orleans. What did you take away from the interview process and what do you have your eyes on now when it comes to being a head coach one day?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefinitely learned how to accept rejection. In all seriousness, number one, it was just an honor to be in these conversations. To be so young but to know that my hard work is paying off, I\u2019m just kind of staying focused on just being the best assistant coach that I can possibly be at a place and not worry too much about this self-promotion or doing anything extra. Just really working hard and diving into whatever responsibilities the team needs. Then I would say, on top of it, just accepting feedback and understanding. \u2018What am I going to have to do to grow so that one day I can be in the seat of being a head coach for one of these organizations?\u2019 There are only 30 of them and it was kind of tough to keep hearing no. But after self-reflection, you take the feedback, and now it\u2019s just my responsibility to keep trying to grow in those areas that they think that I can show some improvement in.\n\n(Photo of Charles Lee: Jim Poorten / NBAE via Getty Images)"}, {"url": "https://sports.yahoo.com/charles-lee-fast-riser-nba-100605142.html", "page_content": "Charles Lee is a fast riser in the NBA and could be the next Detroit Pistons head coach\n\nThe Detroit Pistons are still in the early stages of finding their next head coach. But two weeks into the process, strong candidates have emerged.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks assistant coach Charles Lee, New Orleans Pelicans assistant Jarron Collins and former UConn head coach Kevin Ollie have stood out and are expected to make the team\u2019s second round of interviews, league sources confirmed to the Free Press. The team held Zoom interviews last week, and will meet with more candidates this week. Lee, Collins and Ollie will likely meet with the team again for an in-person interview round.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks assistant coach Charles Lee, left, is shown with head coach Mike Budenholzer during the second half of their game Sunday, April 3, 2022 at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wis.

Both had multiple head coaching jobs prior to joining the Pistons. Lee, Collins and Ollie would all be first-time head coaches in the NBA. Ollie is the oldest of the bunch at 50, while Collins and Lee are 44 and 38, respectively.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a breakdown of the youngest of the bunch \u2014 Charles Lee.\n\nLee is a longtime Budenholzer assistant\n\nBucks head coach Mike Budenholzer has grown an impressive coaching tree over the years. Himself a former longtime assistant under legendary San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, several Budenholzer assistants have been sought after. The list includes former Utah Jazz and current Atlanta Hawks coach Quin Snyder, Memphis Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins, former Brooklyn Nets coach Kenny Atkinson and Los Angeles Lakers head coach Darvin Ham (Saginaw).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee could be next. He has been a Budenholzer assistant for nine years, initially joining him in Atlanta in 2014 before following him to Milwaukee in 2018. After interviewing for several vacancies last summer, Lee was promoted by the Bucks to associate head coach in an effort to keep him.\n\nUnder Budenholzer, Lee has been a key part of a Bucks team that won the championship in 2021 and a contending Hawks team that won 60 games in 2014-15.\n\nLee is passionate about player development\n\nThe Bucks recently posted a sit-down interview with Lee on YouTube in which he talked about his responsibilities as an assistant coach and scout, the importance of film and his player development work \u2014 namely with Khris Middleton, Grayson Allen and 2022 first-round pick MarJon Beauchamp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s an insightful interview that gives a good look at who Lee is as a coach.\n\nThe Bucks are a veteran team, and Beauchamp is one of their few players younger than 27. Lee discussed the patience required to coach up a young player such as Beauchamp, while also getting in work with the veteran Allen, a 6-foot-4 sharpshooting wing looking to round out his game.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cool little dynamic, too, because you have two veteran players in Khris and Grayson, and then for myself, reminding myself how to work with a young guy and the attention to detail that it takes and the consistency,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThey don\u2019t pick things up as much, so having some patience and explaining things. It\u2019s been really good for me and my growth as well, because I\u2019ve learned a ton from MarJon.\"\n\nLee said he wants to help Beauchamp better prepare his body for an 82-game season and make him more competitive on both ends of the floor. As for Allen, Lee noted that he had to run more pick-and-rolls and dribble handoffs (DHO) with Middleton injured during most of Milwaukee\u2019s 2022 playoff run.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis summer, the focus is let\u2019s hunt more 3s, how do we get our body and early shot prep together, and then also how are we making pick-and-roll reads, DHO reads, and just feeling more comfortable against different coverages?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool to see him now start to come into his own and have more force when he\u2019s driving the ball, and his paint percentages go up,\u201d he continued.\n\nBucknell guard Charles Lee, center, grabs a loose ball in front of Arkansas guard Ronnie Brewer, left, and guard Jonathon Modica, right, during the second half of their game in the first round of the NCAA tournament in Dallas, Friday, March 17, 2006. Charles Lee scored 24-points in Bucknell's 59-55 win.\n\nLee was a standout at Bucknell\n\nLee never played in the NBA, but his basketball r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is strong. He led Bucknell to consecutive Patriot League championships and NCAA tournament berths in 2005-06 as a co-captain. He earned a long list of awards \u2014 2006 Patriot League Player of the Year, back-to-back tournament MVP awards (the first player in the conference to do so), and three all-conference selections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring his junior and senior seasons, Lee averaged 12.8 points, 6.2 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.8 steals while shooting 43.5% overall and 39.7% from 3. He\u2019s one of 44 players in school history to score at least 1,000 career points, and was a key part of two of the school\u2019s eight NCAA tournament appearances.\n\nHe was one of 25 players named to the Patriot League\u2019s 25th Anniversary Team in 2015, and was inducted into Bucknell\u2019s Hall of Fame in 2017. Though he went undrafted in 2006, he played four years in Europe before returning to Bucknell as an assistant in 2012, where he coached for two years before moving up to the NBA ranks.\n\nListen to \"The Pistons Pulse\" every Tuesday morning and on demand on freep.com or wherever you listen to podcasts.

It is often more about execution and effort over adjustments.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of both,\u201d the Heat\u2019s Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely some things we can adjust on, and then it\u2019s also about a little bit more effort and just doing more.

Game 4 is as close as it gets to must-win for Jimmy Butler and the Heat.\n\nHere are two things worth watching in Game 4, plus some betting advice from Vaughn Dalzell of NBC Sports Edge.\n\n1) Miami has to slow the Jokic/Murray two-man game. Somehow.\n\nDenver\u2019s defense has been impressive in these Finals, holding Miami to a 111.1 offensive rating through three games (for comparison, that is 7.2 below their offensive rating against Boston).\n\nPart of the reason is that Nikola Joki\u0107 can be a better rim protector and defensive player than people give him credit for. Another key is Malone has been able to lean hard into more defensive-based lineups because the two-man game of Jamal Murray and Joki\u0107 has been all the offense the Nuggets need.\n\nThe Murray/Jokic pick-and-roll has been a masterclass in this series \u2014 the Nuggets have a 126 offensive rating this series when running that play. In Game 3, the Denver stars ran 32 pick-and-rolls, and those plays were the foundation of each of them getting a 30-point triple-double (the first teammates to have a 30+ point triple-double in any NBA game).\n\nNikola Jokic and Jamal Murray are the first pair of teammates with triple-doubles in Finals history! Jokic: 32 PTS, 21 REB, 10 AST\n\nMurray: 34 PTS, 10 REB, 10 AST DEN/MIA Game 4: Friday, 8:30pm/et on ABC pic.twitter.com/0hLcPvv0zN \u2014 NBA (@NBA) June 8, 2023\n\n\u201cI mean, the Murray/Jokic two-man game is a pretty hard action to stop,\u201d Haywood Highsmith said. \u201cBut we got great defensive players, got some of the great two-way players in this game, Jimmy [Butler] and Bam [Adebayo], so we\u2019re gonna figure it out. We got a lot of different bodies we can throw at Murray as well.\u201d\n\nMiami may need to sell out to stop Joki\u0107 and Murray and force any other Nugget to beat them. The Heat did blitz the pick-and-roll more in the fourth quarter of Game 3, but that led to Christian Braun cuts to the basket and Denver buckets. Miami may have to live with some of that, they have to keep Murray in particular in check (it feels like Joki\u0107 will get his no matter what).\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, you just can\u2019t do it all the time,\u201d Spoelstra said of defending the Nuggets duo. \u201cThere\u2019s no absolutes when you get to this level. It\u2019s the highest level of competition. You\u2019re getting the highest level of execution. Understanding what they\u2019re trying to get to, and we try to get them out of their comfort zones as much as possible.\n\n\u201cThe first half, they really got to that two-man action quite a bit. They were getting a lot of traction, so they didn\u2019t need to go to any other part of their playbook.\u201d\n\nMiami needs to see the rest of that playbook.\n\n2) Miami has to make shots, rebound, set defense\n\nThe best way for Miami to limit the Jokic/Murray action and the Denver offense in general is to slow the game down. Make them go against a set defense every time down. That didn\u2019t happen enough in Game 3 \u2014 Denver was free-flowing on offense when Miami needs the game played in the mud.\n\nFor the Heat to change that dynamic two key things need to happen.\n\nFirst, Miami has to make shots. It\u2019s simplistic but it\u2019s true. Denver isn\u2019t going to run if they are taking the ball out of the net.\n\nThat starts with 3-pointers, because as has been noted everywhere the Heat are 6-1 when they shoot 45% or better from 3 this postseason (including Game 2 against the Nuggets), and unreasonably hot shooting has sustained their run to the Finals. The Heat starters were 5-of-19 (26.3%) from beyond the arc in Game 3, which is simply not good enough \u2014 Max Strus, Gabe Vincent and the rest of the role players must step up and knock down shots. However, the bigger concern in Game 3 was the Heat shooting 38.2% within eight feet of the basket. The Nuggets\u2019 size is clearly bothering the Heat. Jimmy Butler needs to get downhill and then make the shots, Bam Adebayo has to get the floater to fall, and the Heat need to attack and get to the free throw line.\n\nSecond, the Heat can\u2019t let the Nuggets win the rebounding battle by 25. Denver\u2019s size advantage has played out in this series in many ways (including how they contested 3s in Game 3), but it is most clearly on the glass. Miami is getting one shot and they\u2019re done, but the Nuggets grabbed the offensive rebound on 36.1% of their missed shots in Game 3, and if you give them that many second chances you will pay.\n\nIt will take gang rebounding and effort, but the Heat must be stronger on the glass.\n\n3) Vaughn Dalzell\u2019s betting recommendations\n\nOver/Under: The total continues to drop from game-by-game starting at 219.5 then going from 216.5 to 214.5 and now 210.5 for Game 4. Denver and Miami have struggled with consistency when it comes to scoring, Miami a little more than Denver. The Nuggets are shooting 51% to Miami\u2019s 41% from the field and averaging 10 more free-throw attempts per game. The pace and tempo of this series has barely changed through three games and if it wasn\u2019t for Miami\u2019s 38-point fourth quarter in Game 2, the Under would be 3-0 in this NBA Finals. I will keep riding the Under.\n\nPlayer Props: In this series there have been four players worth betting overs; Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic, Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo. On the other hand, there have been some very good fade prospects for unders such as Kevin Love, Max Strus, Caleb Martin, Michael Porter Jr. and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who are all shooting 31% or worse from the field.

Amaechi went on to play for the Utah Jazz from 2001 to 2003.\n\nHe was traded to the Houston Rockets before the 2003\u201304 season in exchange for Glen Rice, and, though he was an active player, he did not participate in any games for them. The Rockets later traded him to the New York Knicks before the Knicks bought him out of his contract and he eventually retired from playing the sport altogether.\n\nRobert Archibald\n\nRobert Archibald has his own slice of history as the only Scottish player to make the NBA.\n\nHe was drafted with the 32nd pick in the second round of the 2002 NBA draft by the Memphis Grizzlies, who he signed a 2-year contract with.\n\nAfter one season with the team, in which he played only 12 games, Archibald was traded to the Phoenix Suns, before again being traded in December 2003 to the Orlando Magic. A week later he was traded, for the third time that season, to the Toronto Raptors.\n\nHe played 30 games with the Raptors and holds NBA career averages of 1.2 points and 1.6 rebounds per game.\n\nThe 6\u201911\u201d big man represented GB for six straight years from 2006-2012, collecting 46 caps which culminated in suiting up at the London 2012 Olympics.\n\nArchibald sadly took his own life at the age of 39.\n\nSteve Bucknall\n\nThe first British-developed player to make the NBA, Steve Bucknall suited up for the Lakers during the 1989-90 season.\n\nOriginally coming through the Crystal Palace programme, Bucknall went to the US for High School at Governer\u2019s Academy before heading to college to play under the legendary Dean Smith.\n\nFollowing a successful college career at the University of North Carolina, the 6\u20196\u2033 215 lbs shooting guard went undrafted in 1989, but hooked on with the Lakers during training camp.\n\nHe made 18 appearances during the season, averaging 1.3 points in 4.2 minutes per game.\n\nHe returned to the UK to play for Sunderland the following season before a successful career both domestically and in Europe before retiring in 2007, as his rookie season was his only year with the league.\n\nLuol Deng\n\n\n\nThe UK\u2019s greatest ever player, Luol Deng was a two-time NBA All-Star and by far the most successful Brit in the NBA.\n\nAfter playing college basketball for the Duke for a single season, Deng was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 2004 NBA draft with the seventh overall pick, where he was swiftly traded to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nHe was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team as a 19-year-old in 2005, was an All-Star with the Bulls in 2012 and 2013 before splitting the 2013\u201314 season with the Cleveland Cavaliers. After just half a season with Cleveland, Deng joined the Miami Heat for 2014\u201315. He played two seasons for the Heat before signing with the Lakers in 2016. He spent his last season with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nHe made 902 appearances over his career, with career averages of 14.8 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.3 assists and 1 steal per game.\n\nOn 17 October 2019 Deng signed a one-day contract to retire with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nJoel Freeland\n\n\n\nThe only other Brit to play in the NBA in the 2010s outside of Luol Deng, Joel Freeland held a three-year deal with the Portland Trailblazers from 2012-2015.\n\nOn 28 June 2006, he was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 2006 NBA Draft as the 30th overall draft pick, however, he opted to stay in Europe to improve his game, becoming one of the premier big men on the continent with Unicaja Malaga in the ACB and Euroleague.\n\nDespite a rocky road to his NBA career, being assigned to the Idaho Stampede of the NBA D-League in December of his rookie season, he soon found a rhythm, working his way into the rotation.\n\nHe had a career-high of 17 rebounds in December of 2014, and a career-high 16 points against Oklahoma City Thunder in April of 2015.\n\nIn 151 appearances in the NBA, Freeland averaged 3.2 points and 3.4 rebounds in 12.1 minutes per game.\n\nOn 13 July 2015, Freeland signed a two-year contract with the Russian club CSKA Moscow, where he won a Euroleague title in 2016, was a two time VTB United League champion and rounded out his playing career in 2017.\n\nPops Mensah-Bonsu\n\nAfter going undrafted in the 2006 NBA draft, he joined the Dallas Mavericks for the 2006 NBA Summer League before signing with them for his rookie year.\n\nDuring his rookie season, he had multiple assignments with the Fort Worth Flyers of the NBA Development League. In the 2006\u201307 season, he managed just 12 games for the Mavericks, averaging 2.4 points and 1.8 rebounds in 5.9 minutes per game, and was waived in July of 2007.\n\nAfter a stint in Europe, he managed a return to the league with San Antonio in 2009 on a 10-day contract after impressing with their D-League squad Austin Toros. Two days after his 10-day contract with the Spurs was up, he signed with the Toronto Raptors for the rest of the 2008\u201309 season where he had his most productive stint in the league, averaging over 5 points and 5 rebounds in just 13.8 minutes per game in 19 appearances.\n\nIn August 2009, Mensah-Bonsu signed with the Houston Rockets but was waived in November after playing just four games.Four days later, he was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Raptors, where he remained until January 2010 when he was released and signed in Europe.\n\nHis final stint in the NBA was the 2010-11 season with the New Orleans Hornets where he played until being waived in early January of 2011.\n\nPops made 61 total appearances in the NBA, with career averages of 3 points, and 3 rebounds per game.\n\nMensah-Bonsu earned 40 international caps for the Great Britain Men\u2019s National Team between 2008 and 2012. He averaged 15.3 points and 8.8 rebounds per game during his international career and recorded 14 double-doubles including a career best 32 points and 21 rebounds against Bosnia and Herzegovina on 26 August 2010.\n\nMichael Olowakandi\n\n\n\nDespite being born in Nigeria, Olowakandi moved to England when he was 4 years old and was raised here; he didn\u2019t start playing basketball properly until he was 18 years old (despite being a 6\u20328\u2033 sixteen year old!).\n\nAged 20 and at Brunel University in West London, he decided this was his last opportunity to chase dreams of professional basketball. He went to the library, pulled out a directory called Peterson\u2019s a guide to four year American colleges and opened it up \u2013 it opened to Pacific.\n\nHe called them, explained he was 7\u20321\u2033 and wanted to play basketball and the rest, as they say, is history. He became a star for the team, leading them to the 1997 NCAA Tournament in his junior year, and as a senior averaged 22 points, 11 rebounds and 3 blocks to be named the Big West Conference Player of the Year. He was drafted with the first overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft, having a nine-year NBA career, earning a cool $38million.\n\nOlowakandi\u2019s most productive years were the last two years with the Clippers, averaging almost a double-double in 2002-03 with 12.3 points and 9.1 rebounds per game.\n\nHe made 500 appearances in the league, with career averages of 8.3 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game.\n\nBritish Born or Heritage Players to Make the NBA\n\nThe following players have ties to the UK \u2013 either through being born here or having British citizenship through their passports \u2013 though haven\u2019t necessarily ever actually played basketball in the UK before making the NBA.\n\nChris Harris\n\n\n\nChris Harris was actually the first British player to player in the NBA \u2013 born in Southampton, but moving to New York shortly after due to cross-Atlantic shipping being the family trade.\n\nIn the 1955-56 season, he played 15 games for the St. Louis Hawks, before being traded to the Rochester Royals, where, in 26 appearances, he would average 2.6 points in 10 minutes per game.\n\nBen Gordon\n\nBen Gordon was born in London but moved to New York shortly after his birth.\n\nAfter a standout career at UConn where he won a national championship in 2004, he went on to an 11-season career in the NBA, and is the only player to have ever won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award as a rookie.\n\nA teammate of Luol Deng, GB had recruited him for years in the run up to the London 2012 Olympics, but it wasn\u2019t until 2016 at the tail end of his career he made his long awaited debut with the GB Senior Men, against Germany where he dropped 17 points.\n\nOG Anunoby\n\n\n\nOG Anunoby was born in London before moving to the US with his family when he was four years old. He was selected with the 23rd overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors.\n\nThree years deep into his NBA career, he is one of Toronto\u2019s most promising players for the future, being named a member of the World Team for the 2019 Rising Stars Challenge and having a career-high of 32 points in March of 2020 against Denver.\n\nHe hit a game-winning buzzer-beating three-pointer in the NBA \u2018bubble\u2019, in a 104\u2013103 win in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Boston Celtics to prevent the Raptors from going down to an 0\u20133 deficit to the Celtics.\n\nHe is officially listed as British on NBA communications and has an expressed a desire to represent the Great Britain national team.\n\nNdudi Ebi\n\n\n\nNdudi Ebi was born in London but was raised in Nigeria before moving to Houston, where he was selected out of Westbury Christian High School by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 26th pick of the 2003 NBA draft.\n\nAfter Ebi appeared in just 19 games over the course of two seasons, Minnesota attempted to get an exception from the NBA so they could send him to the NBA Development League. Ebi was technically ineligible as the 2005\u201306 NBA season was his third year, and the D-League only accepted players who had been in the NBA for less than two years.\n\nMinnesota wanted to guide Ebi in, and they tacitly argued that Ebi was hardly a two-year veteran in the figurative sense, given his limited playing time. The league rejected Minnesota\u2019s request regarding Ebi, and they released himon 1 November 2005.\n\nEbi signed a free agent contract over the summer of 2006 with the Dallas Mavericks, but after playing five pre-season games, averaging 5.2 points per game, Ebi was waived in October 2006 and would go on to a decade long career all over the world.\n\nByron Mullens\n\n\n\nBorn in Ohio but holding British citizenship due to his English mother, Byron Mullens, was drafted 24th overall by the Dallas Mavericks in the 2009 NBA draft, where his draft rights were traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nHe appeared in just 26 games across his first two seasons with Oklahoma, before being traded to Charlotte Bobcats where he had his most productive two seasons in the league, averaging over 22 minutes per game and just short of 10 points per outing.\n\nMullens rounded out his time in the NBA with the LA Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers before departing for China in the 2014-15 season and has played in multiple countries since.\n\nFor the 2020-21 season, Mullens signed with London Lions of the British Basketball League, in part due to wanting to play for Great Britain \u2013 reaffirming his intent to suit up in the upcoming FIBA qualifying windows.\n\nKelenna Azubuike\n\nBorn in London, England and raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Kelenna Azubuike went undrafted in 2005, playing in the D-League for two seasons for Fort Worth Flyers before signing with the Golden State Warriors in 2007.\n\nDuring his second season with Golden State, Azubuike expressed an interest in playing for the Great Britain team during the build-up to the 2012 London Olympic Games, but was denied British citizenship under the 1981 British Nationality Act due to the legal status of his parents in the UK at the time of his birth.\n\nIn 2008, Azubuike signed an offer sheet with the Los Angeles Clippers for a three-year deal worth $9 million, that Golden State matched at the final hour. Missing the 2009-10 season due to a patellar tendon tear, Azubuike was traded to the New York Knicks but never played a game for them.\n\nIn 2012, Azubuike was signed by the Dallas Mavericks, where he was assigned to the Mavericks\u2019 D-League affiliate, the Texas Legends, as part of his comeback. On 20 April 2012, Azubuike played in his first NBA game since 14 November 2009, against the Golden State Warriors. On 28 June 2012, during the 2012 NBA Draft, Azubuike was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers where he was waived ahead of the season.\n\nJames Donaldson\n\nBorn in Heacham, England, 7\u20192\u2033 James Donaldson had a 14 year career in the NBA, where he had his best years with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nRaised in California, he was drafted by the Seattle SuperSonics with the 73rd pick in the 1979 NBA draft, and made the 1988 All-Star game. Donaldson also played for San Diego/LA Clippers, Dallas Mavericks, New York Knicks, and the Utah Jazz.\n\nStatistically, his best season was in 1986-87 when he averaged 10.8 points and 11.9 rebounds in 82 starts for Dallas.\n\nIn 957 appearances in the league, Donaldson averaged 8.6 points, 7.8 rebounds and 1.3 blocks on 57.1% shooting.\n\nSteve Nash\n\nNot known by many, Steve Nash holds British (and Canadian) citizenship through a Welsh mother and English father.\n\nBorn in South Africa, he was raised in Victoria, British Columbia from 18 months old.\n\nHe played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), where he was an eight-time All-Star and a seven-time All-NBA selection. Nash was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player while playing for the Phoenix Suns and internationally chose to represent Canada where he helped them medal at the 1999 and 2001 AmeriCup.\n\nAll images courtesy: NBAE/Getty Images"}, {"url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/top-5-former-nba-players-found-success-european-basketball", "page_content": "While the NBA is the biggest basketball league in the world, former players have opted to play in other leagues across Europe after retirement.\n\nFew couldn't bear to stay as they found their way back to the US in under a season. But some traveled miles across the world and continued to dominate, for the rules of basketball do not change.\n\nIt is a popular belief that the NBA is the most difficult league to play in just by evaluating the sheer number of elite talent in the league. However, the NBA has been accused of being too soft, which is why European basketball is a bit more physical. Three years ago, the legendary Kobe Bryant shared the same view.

English was arguably the best scorer in the league during the 80s as he played for the Denver Nuggets, winning the NBA scoring title once and making eight consecutive All-Star appearances.\n\nIn what was his final NBA season, he signed with the Dallas Mavericks as a rotation player and failed to produce at the level everyone had grown accustomed to. After his one-year stint with the Mavericks, he opted to play for Depi Napoli, an Italian team.\n\nPeak Frobe @PeakFrobe Alex English during the 1980s:\n\n\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f25.9 PPG\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f4.4 APG\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f5.9 RPG\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f51.0 FG%\n\n\u25aa\ufe0f83.8 FT%\n\n\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f3x All NBA\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f8x All Star\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f1983 Scoring Champion\n\n\u25ab\ufe0fScored 21,018 points\n\n\u25ab\ufe0f8 consecutive 2,000 PT seasons Alex English during the 1980s:\u25aa\ufe0f25.9 PPG \u25aa\ufe0f4.4 APG \u25aa\ufe0f5.9 RPG\u25aa\ufe0f51.0 FG%\u25aa\ufe0f83.8 FT%\u25ab\ufe0f3x All NBA \u25ab\ufe0f8x All Star \u25ab\ufe0f1983 Scoring Champion \u25ab\ufe0fScored 21,018 points\u25ab\ufe0f8 consecutive 2,000 PT seasons https://t.co/H75RhkYpN0\n\nIn the one year he spent with the Italian side, he averaged 14 points and played in only 18 games. English retired from the NBA with career averages of 21.5 points, 5.5 rebounds and 3.6 assists. He was also the first player to score 2,000+ points for eight consecutive seasons.\n\n#4 George Gervin\n\nFormer NBA player George Gervin\n\nThe NBA hosted some of the most prolific scorers, and George Gervin was one of them. He was an elite shooting guard who made nine All-Star appearances and led the league in scoring for three consecutive seasons from 1978, and once in 1982.\n\nGervin retired from the NBA in 1986 and went on to ply his trade in Europe the following season. He retired at the age of 33 and opted to give it another go while playing for Banco Di Roma in Italy. That season, he averaged 26.1 points per game.\n\nNBA History @NBAHistory Happy B-Day to Iceman, 4-time @NBA scoring champ George Gervin and originator of one of the smoothest moves in all of hoops: The Finger Roll Happy B-Day to Iceman, 4-time @NBA scoring champ George Gervin and originator of one of the smoothest moves in all of hoops: The Finger Roll https://t.co/leAZmxVhhP\n\nHe returned to Europe for the 1989-90 season after playing for Quad City Thunder in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA). But this time, he played for TDK Manresa in the Spanish National Basketball League. Although he's not as quick, he averaged 25.5 points and five rebounds.\n\n#3 Dominique Wilkins\n\nChris Bosh #1 of the Miami Heat and the Eastern Conference celebrates with NBA Legend Dominique Wilkins\n\nDominique Wilkins made several trips to and from the NBA in his 17-year career as a basketball player. Although he did not win an NBA championship, he had a successful NBA career, making nine All-Star appearances, and was the scoring champion in 1986.\n\nAn area where Wilkins excelled was by dunking the ball, and he took that to Europe during his two different runs. He played for Panathinaikos in Greece and helped them win the Greek Cup in 1996. The nine-time NBA All-Star also won the Greek Cup Finals MVP and was the top scorer.\n\nWilkins returned to the NBA after his one-year stint in Greece and was part of the bench unit for the San Antonio Spurs. However, he left for Italy to play for Fortutido Bologna and helped down win the Italian Cup.\n\nThe two-time slam dunk champion made a final return to the NBA to play with the Orlando Magic. At the end of the 1998-99 season, he retired from professional basketball and was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\n#2 Luis Scola\n\nLuis Scola #4 of Team Argentina aknowledges the the crowd\n\nLuis Scola started his basketball career in Europe, playing in Spain from 1999-2007. He was selected by the San Antonio Spurs in the 2005 NBA draft but terms of his buyout could not be reached so the Spurs traded the rights to Scola in 2007.\n\nScola played only ten seasons in the NBA before retiring as a 36-year-old. He played in China for two seasons before returning to Europe to play for Olympia Milano in the 2019-20 season and Varese in the 2020-21 season.\n\nEurohoops @Eurohoopsnet\n\n\n\neurohoops.net/en/euroleague/\u2026 Luis Scola announced his retirement with little fanfare Luis Scola announced his retirement with little fanfareeurohoops.net/en/euroleague/\u2026\n\nAlthough his contract with Varese had the option of an extension, Scola's playing days are over as he recently rejoined the team as its chief executive officer.\n\n#1 Bob McAdoo\n\nNBA photographer Andy Bernstein (R) shares a laugh with Bob McAdoo\n\nBob McAdoo made an instant impact in the NBA after he was selected with the second overall pick by the Buffalo Braves in the 1972 draft. In his sophomore season, he averaged 30.6 points and was the scoring champion that season.\n\nMcAdoo got better in his third season as he averaged 34.5 points and 14.1 rebounds to win the second of three consecutive scoring titles. After a successful NBA career where he was crowned MVP once and won two championships, he opted to play in Europe.\n\nThe five-time All-Star played for three Italian teams in seven years and won one Italian Cup and two Italian league championships.

As MARCA has learned, the NBA and FIBA have already begun to negotiate over the creation of an NBA-led competition in the continent. Some negotiations are so advanced that we could see this project hitting the light of day in the imminent future.\n\nDoes this mean that Fenerbahce are going to play against the LA Lakers? No. It means that control of the European brand passes to the NBA, which will see its arrival in Europe as the fifth competition under the organisations umbrella, following on from the NBA, WNBA, G-League and BAL (Basketball Africa League).\n\nThe discontent shown by several Euroleague clubs that has led to the departure of Jordi Bertomeu, CEO of the league, for next season, has partly caused the steps to be accelerated for the creation of NBA Europe, as has been confirmed by various sources to MARCA.\n\nIMG's rights, the main stumbling block\n\nPrudence is now the main concern, since they want to take the right steps and not go wrong in the same way that football's European Super League did, for the creation of the largest competitive basketball project in decades. A project supported by NBA and FIBA and that would have the approval of the national leagues.\n\nOne of the main obstacles to the birth of NBA Europe, which already has its offices in London, is the agreement signed in 2015 by the Euroleague clubs with the sporting multinational organisation IMG (International Management Group) for ten years at a cost of 630 million euros. A contract that has three years remaining in duration and of which the clubs receive 60 percent for television and marketing rights. This amount increases as a result of performance variables.\n\nNow the seven clubs that are leading the movement out of the Euroleague will have to convince the rest of the teams (among which are Real Madrid, Barcelona and Baskonia) to join the NBA Europe project and will have to start negotiating with IMG, which has planned a fine of 10 million euros for any team that terminates their contract early.\n\nFIBA has acknowledged in a statement the contacts with the Euroleague president and the ECA partners, in a meeting to which 'the NBA, as a historical partner', was also invited to participate. The conclusion of this meeting saw all parties agreeing to hold regular meetings in the coming months.\n\nAlso, the NBA through its spokesman, Mike Bass, have issued a statement confirming these meetings.\n\n\"The NBA has a long relationship with FIBA to grow basketball around the world through initiatives such as Basketball Without Borders and Basketball Africa League, we have also played several exhibition games against Euroleague teams over the years. As part of our continuous collaboration with both parties, we were recently invited to participate in discussions on how we can work together to grow basketball in Europe.\"\n\nFinally, the Euroleague also issued a statement acknowledging the contacts and even a meeting in Madrid, although clarifying that the creation of a European NBA league wasn't one of the topics of conversation.\n\nThey also assured that there was no letter from Adam Silver, NBA commissioner, to Jordi Bertomeu, current CEO of Euroleague, before withdrawing that statement completely.\n\nAn old dream\n\nIt's not the first time that there has been talk of creating a European division of the NBA, although this time it seems like a genuinely real option. At the 2003 all-star game, then-commissioner, David Stern, spoke about the possibility of creating a league with the European teams that would face NBA teams.\n\n\"There are reasons to seriously think that franchises could be created in Europe,\" admitted Stern, who had always dreamed of such an expansion of the NBA. \"We have decided that it is something we had to talk about again, I already said it 10 years ago.\" Now another 10 years have passed and the whole project is taking shape.\n\nUnhappy with the Euroleague\n\nThe creation of a European division of the NBA would be a serious blow to the Euroleague. The biggest continental basketball competition faces an uncertain immediate future after the meetings held in Barcelona and in which some teams, the same teams that lead the march to NBA Europe, showed their intention to bring their positions closer to the FIBA, in order to end the conflict that has been kept for years.\n\nThe teams have taken advantage of these meetings in Barcelona to show their concern about the economic situation of the competition after the crisis that was caused by the pandemic. The drop in income and distribution is another of the pushing factors between the 13 teams that own the competition and that has caused a schism between them."}, {"url": "https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/36189200/sources-pistons-get-ok-interview-bucks-charles-lee", "page_content": "The Detroit Pistons received permission to interview Milwaukee Bucks associate head coach Charles Lee, one of the leading candidates in the franchise's search for a new head coach, sources told ESPN on Friday.\n\nLee has been an assistant for Mike Budenholzer for the past nine seasons -- including the past four with the Bucks -- and ascended to the Bucks' top assistant's job with the departure of Darvin Ham to the Los Angeles Lakers in the offseason.\n\nThe Bucks are expected to receive permission to meet with two more assistant coaches who'll be significant candidates in the process: Toronto Raptors assistant Adrian Griffin and Miami Heat assistant Chris Quinn, sources said.\n\nDwane Casey stepped down as head coach of the Pistons at the end of this season.

Names have been added and subtracted as other NBA head coaching vacancies have been filled. It seems an almost certainty that the next Pelicans coach will be on the sidelines during the NBA Finals.\n\nAs many names have been tossed around, the one that keeps coming up is Charles Lee, the 36-year old currently serving as an assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks. If you peel back a layer or two from his CV, you\u2019ll discover an impressive and rare combination of credentials.\n\nConsidered a candidate a year ago before the Pelicans hired Stan Van Gundy, there was a chance Lee would already be in New Orleans now. In fact, Van Gundy really wanted Lee on his coaching staff. Lee was also viewed as a possible replacement by the Indiana Pacers when Nate McMillan was let go last summer.\n\nLee followed head coach Mike Budenholzer from the Atlanta Hawks to Milwaukee. In his three seasons as a Bucks assistant, Lee has been instrumental in the development of Milwaukee stars Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton. He could parlay that success into helping develop Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram expand their skills.\n\nIt appears Lee understands what it takes for a player to reach the next level. It is not a cookie-cutter process. Each individual has unique skills and different buttons that need to be pushed. Certain things motivate an individual while not working with others. A good coach recognizes what those things are to fit each player. Those who don\u2019t do so fail in the modern NBA.\n\nLee\u2019s duties have included opponent scouting and player development. He understands strategy. For an NBA head coach to experience success, he must have knowledge of the game to be sure but communication skills are vital. He is meticulous in preparation but also good with people.\n\nEven as a professional player, Lee worked hard and exceeded expectations. He spent time in the NBA Summer League playing for the San Antonio Spurs in \u201906 before moving on to play in Belgium, Germany and Israel. The Bucknell alum then sharpened his mind for two years on Wall Street.\n\nAs a 6-foot-3 guard at Bucknell, Lee was once called \u201cone of college basketball\u2019s best non scholarship players\u201d by the New York Times.
