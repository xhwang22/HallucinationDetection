On September 26, the Colombian government signed a historic peace deal with the FARC guerrillas. On October 2, this deal was surprisingly rejected by a plebiscite. Then, on October 7, it was announced that the President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos had won the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\u201cA member of the UN Security Council, China supported us in something very important: the designation of a commission accompanying the process to ensure that all parties fulfilled their obligation.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in October Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made an official visit to the South American country to reaffirm China\u2019s support for the peace process. We interviewed the new Ambassador of Colombia to China, Mr. Oscar Rueda, to get his thoughts on Colombia\u2019s recent developments.\n\nChina Today (CT): Mr. Ambassador, would you like to comment on the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to President Juan Manuel Santos?\n\nOscar Rueda (OR): The members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee have sent us an excellent message, because the Nobel Peace Prize is given not only to those who have achieved peace, but to those who seek peace. The Nobel Prize has always been understood as recognition, but this Nobel Prize has provided support, because now Colombians \u2013 both those who chose \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d in the plebiscite \u2013 are committed to that peace.\n\nThe Nobel Prize gives us the support that we need to achieve what we are aiming for in this process of renegotiation: peace.\n\nCT: Immediately after hearing the adverse outcome of the plebiscite, President Juan Manuel Santos said to the Colombian people: \u201cI have always believed in a wise Chinese proverb that advises searching for opportunities in any situation, and here we have an opportunity.\u201d Is China very much on the mind of President Santos?\n\nOR: Yes, because China has always supported us from its position. And we also had the fortunate coincidence of an official visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Foreign Minister Wang had planned to reiterate that message of support for the peace process, and the lucky coincidence was that Chinese foreign minister arrived in Colombia on the very day the Nobel Peace Prize was announced.\n\nCT: What was China\u2019s decisive role in the peace process?\n\nOR: The problem with these peace talks is credibility. What prevails is generally distrust on both sides. So, international support was a shield against this distrust, and who better to support us in the United Nations than China?\n\nA member of the UN Security Council, China supported us in something very important: the designation of a commission accompanying the process to ensure that all parties fulfilled their obligations. That is one of China\u2019s predominant roles. China has also played an active part in the peace process and in the removal of landmines, for which it has provided us new technology.\n\nCT: What were the results of the Chinese foreign minister\u2019s visit to Colombia?\n\nOR: His visit was very important because Mr. Wang brought a specific message from President Xi Jinping supporting the peace process. But there were also practical issues to do with trade and investment, which for us are very significant. We have a debt to the infrastructure of our country; as part of the peace process we are trying to appropriate a vast part of the country for agricultural development. We told China: \u201cYou have a great opportunity for agricultural investment in Colombia.\u201d\n\nOne of the agricultural projects that we have already introduced to the Chinese government is to develop something called \u201cthe Altillanura\u201d \u2013 an initial plan comprising 30,000 hectares and the building of roads to carry products harvested in the area. It will be a profitable investment for China and will also help meet its food import needs.\n\nCT: Around 50 Chinese companies operate in Colombia. Mr. Ambassador, you have mentioned the necessity for infrastructure in your country. What other sectors could attract Chinese investment?\n\nOR: The first Chinese companies that came to Colombia worked in infrastructure and fuel. The road is already open. It might not be easy due to the rules of the bidding process, but it is clear that the path is there. A Chinese company in Colombia has won a tender for a 4G highway in the Department of Antioquia (the central northwestern part of Colombia).\n\nIn addition to the fuel industry, telecommunications technology and infrastructure, it seems very important to promote the presence of Chinese companies in agricultural business. Colombia already has a Chinese second-tier bank, because the Bank of China has a branch there, but it would be really good if we could also have a Chinese bank operating in Colombia.\n\nCT: Mr. Ambassador, you have been the Deputy Minister of Tourism for seven years. Therefore, you are aware of the importance of Chinese tourists in the world today. Have you thought of proposing some projects to increase the number of Chinese tourists visiting Colombia?\n\nOR: After what you just said, if I did not show significant progress in the field of tourism, nobody would forgive me! In general, more Chinese travelers are starting to go to South America. The figure is still small in Colombia, but it has begun to show a significant percentage growth. We have an annual growth rate of 50 percent and in 2015 we received approximately 12,000 Chinese travelers.\n\nHowever, we have to work on facilitating visa applications. We have made progress. Currently Chinese citizens who have a Schengen Visa or a United States Visa no longer need to obtain one for Colombia. Furthermore, documentation visas that previously had to be sent to Bogota City for approval are now partly authorized here in Beijing, which expedites the process. However, I think there is definitely scope for further progress.\n\nThe most important thing is to develop a tourist offer in Colombia which appeals to the Chinese market. And in fact, we have it: We plan to continue working with the countries of the Pacific Alliance (Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Mexico) to produce and promote a joint tourist offer.\n\nCT: What are the goals that you want to reach by the end of your tenure as ambassador to China?\n\nOR: I am a newcomer, and I am so happy to be here that I do not want to talk about the end of my tenure. But obviously, I must have objectives. Relations between Colombia and China are very good at the moment, and we have to use that to encourage growth.\n\nWe should increase trade, while narrowing the gap, as we have a significant trade deficit with China. We need Colombia to export more products to China, and China to invest more capital in Colombia. The gap is closing, however, and we need to fill that remaining with investments and tourism. That is the challenge.\n\nCT: In an article published in the newspaper El Tiempo in 2005, you wrote: \u201cThe first surprise when you arrive in Beijing is not its marvelous pagodas or its beautiful upturned roofs, but the city itself, which is a metropolis of wide avenues and large buildings.\u201d Has China surprised you this time?\n\nOR: I had forgotten about that article I wrote on my first trip to China. After that first trip I was fortunate to come here almost every year, and whenever I came, China always surprised me. China does not lose that ability.\n\nBeyond tourism, development and architectural surprises, this mission as ambassador is giving me the opportunity to see China from another perspective: from the point of view of its unique politics and method of development, called \u201csocialism with Chinese characteristics.\u201d\n\nCT: And what has surprised you most?"}, {"url":

CALL TO ACTION TO\n\nGOVERNMENTS OF THE G20 NATIONS\n\nWe are writing to call for immediate internationally coordinated action\u2013within the next few days\u2013to address our deepening global health and economic crises from COVID-19.\n\nThe communique from the extraordinary G20 Leaders meeting on March 19, 2020, recognized the gravity and urgency of the entwined public health and economic crises, but we now require urgent specific measures that can be agreed on with speed and at scale: emergency support for global health initiatives led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and emergency measures to restore the global economy. Both require world leaders to commit to funding far beyond the current capacity of our existing international institutions.\n\nIn 2008-2010, the immediate economic crisis could be surmounted when the economic fault line\u2013under-capitalization of the global banking system\u2013was tackled. Now, however, the economic emergency will not be resolved until the health emergency is effectively addressed: the health emergency will not end simply by conquering the disease in one country alone, but by ensuring recovery from COVID-19 in all countries.\n\nGlobal Health Measures\n\nAll health systems\u2013even the most sophisticated and best funded\u2013are buckling under the pressures of the virus. Yet if we do nothing as the disease spreads in poorer African, Asian, and Latin American cities and townships and in fragile communities which have little testing equipment, ventilators, and medical supplies; and where social distancing and even washing hands are difficult to achieve, COVID-19 will persist there and re-emerge to hit the rest of the world with further rounds that will prolong the crisis.\n\nWorld leaders must immediately agree to commit $8 billion\u2013as set out by the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board\u2013to fill the most urgent gaps in the COVID-19 response. This includes:\n\n\u2022 $1 billion this year for WHO: This would enable WHO to carry out its critically important mandate in full. While it has launched a public appeal\u2013200,000 individuals and organizations have generously donated more than $100 million\u2013it cannot be expected to depend on charitable donations.\n\n\u2022 $3 billion for Vaccines: The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is coordinating the global research effort to develop and scale up effective COVID-19 vaccines and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi). In addition, Gavi will have an important role procuring and equitably distributing vaccines to the poorest countries and requires $7.4 billion for its replenishment: this should be fully funded.\n\n\u2022 $2.25 billion for Therapeutics: The COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator aims to deliver 100 million treatments by the end of 2020 and is seeking these funds to rapidly develop and scale-up access to therapeutics.\n\n\u2022 Instead of each country, or state or province within it, competing for a share of the existing capacity, with the risk of rapidly increasing prices, we should also be vastly increasing capacity by supporting the WHO in coordinating the global production and procurement of medical supplies, such as testing kits, personal protection equipment, and ITU technology to meet fully the worldwide demand. We will also need to stockpile and distribute essential equipment.\n\nA further $35 billion will be required, as highlighted by WHO, to support countries with weaker health systems and especially vulnerable populations, including the provision of vital medical supplies, surge support to the national health workforce (70% of whom in many countries are underpaid women), and strengthening national resilience and preparedness. According to WHO, almost 30% of countries have no COVID-19 national preparedness response plans and only half have a national infection prevention and control program. Health systems in lower income countries will struggle to cope; even the most optimistic estimates from Imperial College London suggest there will be 900,000 deaths in Asia and 300,000 in Africa.\n\nWe propose the convening of a global pledging conference\u2013its task supported by a G20 Executive Task Force\u2013to commit resources to meeting these emergency global health needs.\n\nGlobal Economic Measures\n\nMuch has been done by national governments to counter the downward slide of their economies. But a global economic problem requires a global economic response. Our aim should be to prevent a liquidity crisis turning into a solvency crisis, and a global recession becoming a global depression. To ensure this, better coordinated fiscal, monetary, central bank, and anti-protectionist initiatives are needed. The ambitious fiscal stimuli of some countries will be all-the-more effective if more strongly complemented by all countries in a position to do so.\n\n\u2022 A wider group of central banks should be given access to the arrangements for currency swaps and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should enter into swap arrangements with the major central banks. The IMF should use those hard currency resources and establish its own swap line facility to provide emergency financial support to emerging and developing nations. But it is vital that if we are to prevent mass redundancies, the guarantees that are being given in each country are rapidly followed through by banks via on-the-ground support for companies and individuals.\n\n\u2022 The emerging economies\u2013and in particular those of the poorest countries\u2013need special help, not the least in ensuring that support reaches all those affected by the drastic decrease in economic activity. The IMF has said it will mobilize all of its available resources. There should be an additional allocation of around $500-$1,000 billion in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). At the same time, to ensure sufficient funding for individual countries, we encourage IMF members to allow lending quota limits to be exceeded in countries most in need.\n\n\u2022 The World Bank and many of the regional development banks have recently been recapitalized, but more will be needed. It is likely that, as in 2009 when the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development\u2019s (IBRD) spending alone went from $16 billion to $46 billion, it and the regional development banks will need a much larger expansion of available resources.\n\n\u2022 To meet its responsibilities for humanitarian aid, and for refugees and displaced people, whose plight is likely to become desperate, and for the UN Sustainable Development Goals, UN agencies have issued this week an immediate call for $2 billion of additional resources that are urgently needed.\n\n\u2022 The international community should waive this year\u2019s poorer countries\u2019 debt repayments, including $44 billion due from Africa, and consider future debt relief to allow poor countries the fiscal space to tackle the health and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We ask the G20 to task the IMF and the World Bank to further assess the debt sustainability of affected countries.\n\n\u2022 We agree with African and developing country leaders that given the existential threat to their economies, the increasing disruption to livelihoods and education and their limited capacity to cushion people and companies, that at least $150 billion of overall support, much of it on concessional terms, will be needed for health, social safety nets, and other urgent help.\n\nThese allocations should be agreed to immediately, coordinated by a G20 Executive Task Force as part of the G20 Action Plan, and be confirmed in full at the upcoming IMF and World Bank meetings. The two core economic institutions should be given reassurances that additional bilateral funding will be forthcoming and the need for further capital injections agreed.\n\nThe longer-term solution is a radical rethink of global public health and a refashioning\u2013together with proper resourcing\u2013of the global health and financial architecture.\n\nThe United Nations, the governments of the G20 nations, and interested partners should work together to coordinate further action.\n\nApril 6, 2020\n\nSigned,\n\nBertie Ahern\n\nTaoiserach of the Republic of Ireland (1997-2008)\n\nRashid Alimov\u02da\n\nMinister of Foreign Affairs of Tajikistan (1992-1994);
